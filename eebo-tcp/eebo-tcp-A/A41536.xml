            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His following Treatiſe <hi>[The Tryall of a
Chriſtians Growth]</hi> was formerly printed
during the time of my abſence out of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country: and by reaſon thereof had
many imperfections and incongruities both
in ſtyle and matter; which, now being againe (through
the good hand of God upon me) returned, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to amend. So as partly through ſome alteration in
the method and frame of it, partly by cutting off ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancies,
I have reduced it to ſome better ſhape, and
neerer proportion to its fellowes.</p>
            <p>The ſcope and way of handling this ſubject <hi>[Growth]</hi>
is not <hi>Doctrinall</hi> ſo much, nor yet <hi>Hortatory,</hi> as either
perſwading to, or diſcourſing of a Chriſtians growth in
generall, (concerning which much hath been already writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by others) But the more proper aime of this is to reſolve
<hi>A Caſe of Conſcience,</hi> (like as thoſe two other preceding
Tractates of mine have done) namely this, <hi>How to diſcern
our growth,</hi> and to anſwer more uſuall temptations about
it: And ſo theſe three Treatiſes being of like ſort and
kinde, and properly belonging to that part of <hi>Theologie</hi>
which we call <hi>Caſe Divinity;</hi> I have therefore in this new
Edition of the whole ordered to put them together, (which
is all the alteration I have made) although in their firſt
and ſingle publiſhing ſome other came between.</p>
            <p>If in the performance this falls ſhort of many more
<pb facs="tcp:56064:3"/>
raiſed experiments of Growth which are found in ſuch as
the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> calls <hi>Fathers,</hi> elderly Chriſtians, who
with <hi>Enoch</hi> have <hi>walked</hi> long with God; yet I have hoped
that you that are <hi>young men</hi> (as he alſo ſtyles the middle
ſort of Chriſtians) that <hi>you</hi> may finde many things help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to your right underſtanding and judging of your
growth, and which may free you from many miſtakes in
miſ-judging thereof, and ſo conſequently of many tentations
about it, which that Age of Beleevers are more peculiarly
incident unto. I dare not ſay, <hi>I write theſe things to you
Fathers,</hi> I never preſumed it in my thoughts; I my ſelfe
wrote and preached it when I was but young in years, and
<hi>for the time</hi> far younger in grace and experience. And I
dare not (if the great Apoſtle would not) <hi>ſtretch my ſelfe
beyond that meaſure which God hath diſtributed to
me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 14.</note> 
               <hi>A meaſure, which,</hi> yet, <hi>may reach you</hi> that are
young men, though more eminent grown Chriſtians are gone
far beyond the line of it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Parable hath three Parts:</p>
                  <p>1. A <hi>Vine</hi> here is, of all the <hi>faireſt, ver. 1.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, this <hi>Vine,</hi> as all <hi>Vines</hi> elſe, hath <hi>two</hi> ſorts of <hi>branches:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Such as (though greene) bring forth no true fruit, nought

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Such as bring forth fruit, <hi>ver. 2.</hi>

Amputare &amp; Putare,</hi> to <hi>Lop</hi> and <hi>Cut off.</hi> Firſt, clean to <hi>cut
off</hi> thoſe that are utterly unfruitfull, which thereupon are
<hi>caſt out,</hi> doe <hi>wither,</hi> and are <hi>gathered and caſt into the fire:</hi>
So <hi>ver. 2. &amp; 6.</hi> And thus now he meant to deale with

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, his <hi>end</hi> in all is, that <hi>fruit,</hi> and <hi>more fruit</hi> might be
brought forth. This is his end of planting this Vine, this is
the end of purging theſe branches of it, which he being fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
of, in thoſe other, is the cauſe why he takes them cleane
away.</p>
                  <p>And to exhort theſe unto fruitfulneſſe, was one main end

                  <p>The principall ſubject I aime at in this Scripture, is this maine

of many good ſouls, How a Chriſtian may diſcerne his
growth, both in purging out corruptions, and increaſe of grace,
and the fruit of it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore what ever other ſpreading fruitfull obſervations
grow upon this ſtock, (and this Vine affords many) wee will but
ſhortly, and as men in haſte, view and take notice of, but as in

               <div type="observation">
                  <head>The firſt Obſervation, how Chriſt is a Vine, and onely the
true Vine.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſt, he is a Vine.</hi> To explaine this firſt. <hi>Adam</hi> indeed
was a Vine, planted in Paradiſe, to beare all Mankinde upon, but
he turned a <hi>wild one,</hi> he proved not the <hi>true Vine.</hi> God planted
him (to allude to that, <hi>Jer. 2. 21.) A noble Vine, a holy and right
ſeed,</hi> but he degenerated, and ſo have all engraffed on him, and
ſo bring forth nothing but <hi>grapes of Sodome,</hi> as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeakes.</p>
                  <p>But 2. God the Father having many branches of choſen ones,
that grew by nature on this curſed ſtock of <hi>Adam,</hi> whom yet,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56064:5"/>
as <hi>ver. 16. he had ordained to bring forth fruit,</hi> that is, to ſpring
and ſpread forth in the earth in all ages, and then to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplanted
unto Heaven, the Paradiſe appointed for them; the
earth being but the nurſerie of them for a while: Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he did appoint his own <hi>Sonne</hi> to be a new root, as into
whom he meant to tranſplant them, and ordained him to be that
bulk, and body, and chiefe branch which they all ſhould grow
out of, who is therefore called <hi>The roote of David, Rev. 22.</hi> and
that <hi>Righteous branch, Jer. 22. 6.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whom therefore 3. he planted as a roote here on earth with
us, and cloathed with a humane nature, a weak and mean bark
and body, and a rind and out ſide, ſuch as ours is; that ſo both
roote and branches might be of the ſame nature, and Homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall:
which nature of ours in him, he likewiſe <hi>filled with his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
(as with juice and ſap) <hi>without all meaſure,</hi> that ſo he might
fructifie, and grow into all thoſe branches appointed to be in
him, by communicating the ſame ſpirit to them.</p>
                  <p>And 4. although he was of himſelfe the faireſt <hi>Cedar</hi> that ever
the earth bare, yet in relation to thoſe multitude of branches,
he was to bear, chuſeth to be a <hi>Vine,</hi> which is of all trees the
loweſt, the weakeſt, and of the meaneſt bark, and out-ſide of any
other, onely becauſe of all others it is the plentifulleſt of bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and runs out and ſpreads its bulk in branches; and thoſe,
of all branches elſe of any other trees, the fruitfulleſt, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>The fruitfull Vine, Pſal. 128. 3.</hi> and for that reaſon
onely doth he ſingle out this compariſon, as ſuiting with his
ſcope, ſhewing therein his love; that as he condeſcended to the
loweſt condition, for our ſalvation, ſo to the meaneſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
for our inſtruction, yet ſo as withall he tells us, that no
Vine, nor all the Vines on earth were worthy herein to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
nor to be ſo much as reſemblances of him.</p>
                  <p>For he,<note place="margin">2. Obſer.</note> and he alone is the true <hi>Vine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">That Chriſt is onely the [True Vine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</note> that is the ſecond Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                  <p>For take thoſe choiceſt excellencies in a Vine, for which the
compariſon here is made, as more particularly, that of <hi>fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
either in boughs or fruit, and it is but a ſhadow of that
which is in him. As God onely is <hi>[I am that I am,]</hi> and all
things elſe have but the ſhadow of Being: ſo Chriſt alone hath
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56064:5"/>
onely all the excellencies in him in the true reall nature of all
things to which he is compared. So in like manner he is ſaid to
be <hi>Bread indeed, John 6. 55.</hi> and <hi>ver. 32. The true bread from
heaven.</hi> Manna, and all other meat, and all that ſweetneſſe which
is in meat, is and was but a ſhadow to that which he affords.
He excells and exceeds all things he is compared to, in what
they have, and they are but ſhadowes to him, <hi>Heb. 10. 1.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, never any Vine ſo fruitfull. <hi>All our fruit is
found in him, Hoſ. 12. If you abide in me, you ſhall bring forth much
fruit.</hi> He hath juice to ſupply you with every grace, to <hi>fill you
with all the fruits of righteouſneſſe,</hi> which if the branches want, it
is for want of faith in themſelves, to draw from him, not want
of ſap in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this he is at all times, hath been in all ages, thus flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing;
this root never withers; is never dry or empty of ſap,
it is never winter with Chriſt. <hi>Every branch,</hi> ſaith the ſecond
<hi>verſe,</hi> that is, every one that hath born fruit in any age, beareth
all its fruit in <hi>him:</hi> branches in him fear no drought, <hi>Jer. 17. 8.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for largeneſſe of ſpreading, no ſuch Vine as this: <hi>He</hi>
(as the Pſalmiſt ſayes, <hi>Pſal. 80. 11, 12.) ſends out his boughes
unto the ſea, and his branches to the rivers:</hi> all the earth is, or hath
been, or ſhall be filled with them.</p>
                  <p>Is to perſwaded us to take Chriſt alone,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> and make him our
All in all, becauſe in him all excellencies are ſupereminently
found. All creatures are not enough to ſerve for compariſons
to ſet him forth, and when they doe in part, for ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
thing that is the excellenteſt in them, yet therein they are
but <hi>ſhadowes, Heb. 10. 1.</hi> He onely is the truth, he is the <hi>true
light, John 1.</hi> The Baptiſt, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all lights elſe were but as
twilight, but a ſhadow: So he is the <hi>true bread,</hi> the <hi>true Vine,</hi>
he hath really the ſweetneſſe, the comfort, the excellencies of
them all. The like may be ſaid of all thoſe relations he hath
taken on him; ſo he onely is a true <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Husband,</hi> &amp;c.
and the love and ſweetneſſe in all other Fathers and Husbands
are but a ſhadow to what is in him.</p>

branch of my planting] the work of my hands.</hi> Other Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
doe but expect what branches their Vines will of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
bring forth, but God appoints who, and how many ſhall
be the branches, and gives them unto, and ingraffs them into his
Sonne.</p>
                  <p>3. He appoints what fruit, and what ſtore of fruit theſe bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ſhall bring forth, and accordingly gives the increaſe, which
other Husbandmen cannot doe: <hi>Paul my plant, and Apollos may
water, but God onely gives the increaſe, 1 Cor. 3. 7.</hi> Though Chriſt
merited, yet the Father decreed every mans meaſure of fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>4. He is the moſt diligent Husbandman that ever was; for he
knowes, and daily views, and takes notice of every branch, and
of all their fruit: for ſayes the Text, <hi>Every branch that brings
not forth fruit, he takes away, &amp;c.</hi> therefore knowes who beareth
fruit, and doth not. He <hi>knowes</hi> their perſons, <hi>who are his,</hi> and
who are not, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 19.</hi> not ſo much as <hi>one</hi> man could come in
<hi>without a wedding garment,</hi> but he ſpies him out.</p>
                  <p>5. The moſt carefull he is daily to <hi>purge</hi> his Vine: ſo ſays the

not onely a hand in Election, but alſo in Sanctification, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

Spirit, or ſtirring of affection: And anſwerable alſo is their fruit,
when no other are found on them, but ſuch as you ſhall finde
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56064:8"/>
grow in the waſte of the wilderneſſe among Heathens, which
ingenuity and modeſty, and naturall honeſty and naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
do bring forth: but not any ſuch, as an inward ſap from
Chriſt uſeth to produce. Civill men are not true branches; for
look on Chriſt the root, and ſee what fruits abounded in him
moſt, as fruits of holineſſe did; and therefore if ſuch were true
branches, the ſame would abound in them likewiſe: for every
tree brings forth according to its kind.</p>
                  <p>2. You have ſome (they living in the Church) Chriſt begins to
ſhoot ſome ſap of his Spirit into their hearts, quickning them
with many good motions, and ſtirring up ſome juiceneſſe of
affections in the adminiſtration of the Word and Sacraments,
which cauſes them to bud forth into good inward purpoſes, and
outward good beginnings: but this being not the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>ſanctifying</hi> and changing the branch into
the ſame nature with the root, therefore it comes to paſſe they
are ſtill nipt in the bud, as the ſtony ground was, and the ſap
ſtricken in again, like rath ripe fruit; which looking forth upon
a February Sun, are nipt againe with an April froſt. Many,
when young, and their affections are green and tender, are
wrought upon, and bud, but the ſcoffes of men nip them, and
their luſts draw the ſap another way, as hopes of preferment,
and the pleaſures of ſinne, and ſo theſe buds wither and fall
off, and the Spirit withdrawes himſelf wholly in the root a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                  <p>Againe, 3. ſome there are, as the <hi>thorny ground,</hi> in whom
this inward ſap communicated to them, though not ſpiritually,
changing and renewing them, yet being communicated in a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
degree, abides in them longer, ſhoots up farther, and theſe
prove exceeding green branches, and are owned for true, even
by the people of God themſelves, as <hi>Judas</hi> was by the Apoſtles,
and therefore are outwardly like unto them; for how elſe are
they ſaid to <hi>be caſt</hi> out? <hi>ver. 16.</hi> who therefore had once ſome
fruit to commend them, for which they were accounted of by
the people of God, and received amongſt them, <hi>who judge of
trees by the fruit.</hi> Neither are their fruits meerly outward, like
<hi>Solomons apples of gold, in pictures of ſilver,</hi> meerly painted, but they
have a ſap that puts a greenneſſe into what they doe, and by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56064:9"/>
reaſon of which they bear and bring forth; for how elſe are
they ſaid <hi>to wither</hi> alſo? <hi>ver. 6.</hi> (which is a decay of inward
moiſture, and outward greenneſſe:) and theſe alſo have ſome
kind of union with Chriſt as with a <hi>Lord, 2 Pet. 2. 1.</hi> he <hi>aſcending
to beſtow gifts, even upon the rebellious alſo, Pſal. 68. 18.</hi> ſo far to
enable them to doe him ſome ſervice in his Vineyard: They are
not united unto Chriſt as unto an <hi>Head.</hi> Neither is it the <hi>ſpirit of
adoption</hi> which they doe receive from him; and ſuch a branch
was <hi>Judas,</hi> who was not onely owned by the Diſciples, who
knew him not to be falſe, but who ſurely at the firſt had inward
ſap of gifts derived from Chriſt, to fit him for the Miniſtery, he
being ſent out as an Apoſtle to preach; whom therefore Chriſt
here aimed at in this place.</p>
                  <p>Now for a more particular differencing of theſe branches
and their fruites,<note place="margin">Some differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of branches fruitfull and unfruitfull.</note> it is not my ſcope to ingraffe a large common
place, head of all the differences, between temporaries and true
beleevers, upon this ſtock; this root is not big enough to bear
them, thoſe differences being many; Onely I will explain thoſe
differences which the Text affords, becauſe they are in our way,
and will further open the words.</p>
                  <p>1. That which they doe bring forth,<note place="margin">1. Difference. How the good works of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are not true fruits.</note> 
                     <hi>is not true fruit,</hi> the holy
Ghoſt vouchaſfeth it not that name, <hi>They</hi> are ſaid here, <hi>not to
bring forth fruit.</hi> That ſpeech in <hi>Hoſea 10. 1.</hi> will give clear light
to underſtand this; with the ground of it alſo; <hi>Iſrael is,</hi> there
called, <hi>an empty Vine, which brings forth fruit to her ſelf.</hi> It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a ſeeming contradiction, that it ſhould be called an <hi>empty
Vine,</hi> and yet withall to <hi>bring forth</hi> any <hi>fruit.</hi> And theſe bring
forth not leaves, good words onely, but good works, good
actions, and thoſe <hi>green,</hi> and therefore <hi>Jude 12. their fruit is
ſaid to wither,</hi> as themſelves are ſaid to <hi>wither</hi> here, <hi>ver. 6.</hi> And
as there <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſaid to be an <hi>empty Vine,</hi> though it hath fruit, ſo
here theſe are ſaid <hi>not to bring forth fruit</hi> at all. Now the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of both, is one and the ſame: For a thing is ſaid to be <hi>empty,</hi>
when it wants that which is proper to it, and ought to be in it;
as Wells are called empty, when are not full of water, they
are full of ayre: for <hi>Non datur vacuum.</hi> So they are called an
<hi>empty Vine,</hi> and theſe <hi>branches to have no fruit,</hi> becauſe not ſuch as
ought to grow upon them, ſuch as is proper to the root they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56064:9"/>
ſeem to grow upon. Therefore in <hi>Heb. 6. 7.</hi> that Epithet is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>[Meet] hearbs,</hi> or <hi>fruit;</hi> that is, <hi>ſuch as ſhould grow there.</hi>
So <hi>Luke 3. 8. They are to bring forth fruit [worthy] amendment
of life,</hi> or elſe they were to be cut down: that is, ſuch as became
true repentants, as were anſwerable, ſuitable therunto. As we
ſay a man carries himſelf <hi>worthy of his place,</hi> when anſwerably to
to what is required of him in it. That place fore-cited out of
<hi>Hoſea</hi> further acquaints us with the true ground, why their fruits
(though green, which <hi>Chap. 6. 4.</hi> is called <hi>goodneſſe</hi> alſo, yet)
were not to be accounted meet fruit, and ſo not fruit at all;
even becauſe of this, that it brought forth all its fruit, whether
good or bad, <hi>to it ſelfe:</hi> That is, thoſe ends that did draw up
the ſap, and did put it forth in fruit, were drawne but from
themſelves, they bring them not forth principally to God. and
for him. All their prayers, all their affections in holy duties, if
they examine the reaſon of them all, the ends that runne in them
all, and whence all the motives that doe actuate all they doe
in theſe, they will finde they are taken from themſelves: And
though the aſſiſtance wherewith they are enabled to doe what
they doe, is more then their own, yet their ends are no higher
then themſelves, and ſo they employ but that aſſiſtance God
gives them wholly for themſelves. Now the <hi>end</hi> for which a
true branch brings forth <hi>fruit,</hi> is, that God might be glorified.
Thus <hi>Rom. 7. 8.</hi> when <hi>married to Chriſt</hi> they are ſaid <hi>to bring
forth fruit to God;</hi> which is ſpoken in oppoſition to <hi>bringing forth
fruit to a mans ſelf.</hi> Thus alſo Chriſt here uſeth this as the great
and main motive to fruitfulneſſe in <hi>ver. 8. Hereby is my Father
glorified, that you bring forth much fruit.</hi> Now whom will this
move, into whoſe affections will ſuch an argument draw up ſap,
and quicken them? None but thoſe hearts who doe make
Gods glory their utmoſt end, and ſo all true branches doe or
elſe this motive ſhould have been uſed by Chriſt in vaine unto
them. And as this end makes their performances to be <hi>fruit,</hi>
ſo this being wanting, all that is brought forth deſerves not
the name of fruit, for it is not <hi>fruit worthy,</hi> as the Baptiſt ſayes,
not <hi>meet fruit for the dreſſer</hi> to receive, (as was noted out of the
<hi>Hebrews)</hi> not ſuch as ought to grow on that tree. <hi>They ſhould
be trees of righteouſneſſe, the planting of the Lord, that he might be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56064:10"/>
glorified, Eſay 61. 3.</hi> Again, not <hi>fruit</hi> meete or <hi>ſuitable</hi> for
the <hi>roote</hi> it ſeemes to grow upon, that is, ſuch as Chriſt did
bring forth; for he did all, that his Father might be glorified:
and therefore ſayes he, exhorting them to fruitfulneſſe, <hi>ver. 8.</hi>
of this <hi>Chap. If you doe likewiſe, ye ſhall bee my Diſciples.</hi> Againe,
otherwiſe it is not ſuch as is <hi>meet</hi> for the <hi>Husbandmans taſte</hi> and
reliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it being equall that <hi>He that planteth a Vineyard, ſhould eate
the fruit of it, 1 Cor. 8. 7.</hi> And in fruit you know above all we
regard the taſte, and eſteeme the reliſh of it. <hi>Eve</hi> firſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the <hi>fruit was good for food,</hi> then <hi>pleaſant</hi> to the eye, <hi>Gen. 3.</hi> It
is not the ſap that is in fruit only makes it acceptable; Crabs
are as full of ſap as apples: Not is it the greenneſſe, or colour,
or bigneſſe, but the reliſh that is the chiefeſt excellencie in it,
though thoſe other, when joyned with a good reliſh, do make it
more deſirable: So though thy performances be full of life and
affection, and green, and long, and many, yet if they reliſh and
taſte of none but ſelf-ends, God regards them not, they are not
<hi>ad guſtum ſuum;</hi> it is the end that gives the reliſh, and makes
them fruits, and acceptable to God.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond difference this Text holds forth,<note place="margin">2. Difference. How Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites bring not forth their fruit [in Chriſt]</note> is, That they
bring not forth their <hi>fruit in Chriſt:</hi> for ſo the Syriack Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
reads it, as making the ſenſe to be, that <hi>they bring not forth
fruit in me:</hi> and ſo this particle <hi>[In me]</hi> referreth not ſo much
to their being <hi>branches in him,</hi> as <hi>to not bearing their fruit in him.</hi>
Which indeed ſeems to have been Chriſts meaning, for his ſcope
in this Parable is to ſhew how that he is the <hi>root of Sanctification;</hi>
and how not the habituall power onely, but every act of grace,
and the performance, comes from him; <hi>Without me ye can doe
nothing, ver. 5.</hi> And thereupon he exhorts his Diſciples to fetch
all <hi>from him,</hi> and to <hi>abide in him;</hi> and therefore alſo, when he
ſpeaks of theſe unfruitfull branches at <hi>ver. 6.</hi> that which here
he calls <hi>bearing not fruit in me,</hi> he expreſſes there, by <hi>not abiding
in me,</hi> as the cauſe of their not bringing forth fruit in him.
Yea, and the principall ſcope of that phraſe, <hi>Abide in me,</hi> is, (as
evidently appeares by <hi>ver. 4, 5.)</hi> to depend upon him for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth of fruit, and to fetch ſtrength from him by faith.
There is therefore this eſſentiall defect in the worke that is
upon ſuch, that they doe not doe all in <hi>that</hi> dependance upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56064:10"/>
Chriſt, <hi>ſuch a dependance</hi> as a branch hath upon the root, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth its fruit. For, my brethren, this you muſt know, that
as it is eſſentiall to <hi>Evangelicall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sanctification</hi> to doe all <hi>for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
as your <hi>end,</hi> namely, to God; ſo to doe all in the ſtrength
<hi>of another,</hi> as your ſole aſſiſtant, namely <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who works all
in you, and <hi>through whoſe ſtrength,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, I am able to doe
all things,</hi> and nothing without it. <hi>The life we leade is by faith,</hi>
and it is <hi>not I, but Chriſt who lives in me.</hi> Therefore we finde
both theſe joyned, <hi>Phil. 1. 11. The fruits of righteouſneſſe by
Jeſus Chriſt, to the praiſe and glory of God.</hi> The latter <hi>[To the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God]</hi> is mentioned as the finall cauſe; the other <hi>[By Jeſus
Chriſt]</hi> as the efficient cauſe:<note place="margin">What it is to bring forth fruit [in Chriſt] ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> Both theſe are neceſſary unto true
Sanctification. For as we are to <hi>honour the Husbandman</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him our <hi>end,</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>root,</hi> by doing all in <hi>him,</hi> and from
him. Now <hi>temporarie Beleevers,</hi> as they do all principally <hi>for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
ſo alſo all as <hi>from themſelves:</hi> and as they do not make <hi>God</hi>
their <hi>end,</hi> ſo nor Chriſt their <hi>root.</hi> And ſo ſome expound that
phraſe in the Parable of the <hi>ſtony ground, Luk. 8. 13.</hi> when it is
ſaid they <hi>have no root,</hi> (though I think he means alſo inherent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
of grace infuſed, for it is added, <hi>no root [in themſelves,]</hi> which
<hi>Job</hi> call <hi>the root of the</hi> matter which was <hi>in him)</hi> it is becauſe they
fetch not their ſtrength to doe all they doe from Chriſt by faith,
and from their union with him. And the reaſon is this, becauſe
they are never emptyed of themſelves, (which is the root we all
doe grow upon) either in regard of their <hi>owne ends,</hi> or of <hi>their
owne efficiencie of working.</hi> Whereas we muſt all be brought to
<hi>nothing</hi> in our ſelves, both in regard of <hi>ſelf-aymes,</hi> and alſo <hi>abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of working; and till our hearts are inwardly taught that
leſſion, <hi>that we are not ſufficient, as of our ſelves,</hi> we will not goe
out of our ſelves, to doe all in Chriſt. And therefore there was
nothing which Chriſt endeavoured more to engraffe upon their
hearts then this Principle now at his departure, as it is <hi>ver.
4, 5.</hi> And indeed it is as hard a thing for nature to live out
of its ſelfe, and fetch all from another, as not to live to its ſelfe,
but to another. We are full of <hi>our owne ſtrength,</hi> as well as of <hi>our
owne ends.</hi> And although theſe unfruitfull branches they do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
receive all their ſtrength from Chriſt, and ſo all they doe
in what is good, is <hi>from him:</hi> yet they doe no honour Chriſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56064:11"/>
in receiving it, by doing all as in his ſtrength, and ſo do not do
it as <hi>in him.</hi> But though they receive all, yet they work with
it, as if it were their owne ſtock, and ſo <hi>glorie</hi> (as the Apoſtle
ſayes) <hi>as if they had not received it.</hi> And thus though the ſap
and livelineſſe which ſtirs them, is really, and all efficiently from
Chriſt, yet they may be ſaid to bring forth <hi>fruit in themſelves,</hi>
becauſe both they neither fetch not receive it by faith, nor act by
faith that ſtrength received, as men that were acted by Chriſt,
and as working all in Chriſt, but they doe all, as if all proceeded
from their owne root: Even as the Ivie, though it claſping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Oake, receives much ſap from it, which it digeſteth
and turneth into it ſelfe, yet it brings forth all its be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ries by
virtue of its owne root, rather then as in the Oake, which yet
ſuſtaines and ſupplyes it with juyce and ſap; whereas a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
brings forth fruit in Chriſt, as a branch that is in and of
the Oake it ſelfe, as its owne root, and ſo <hi>from him all their
fruit is found, Hoſ. 14. 8.</hi> he fetcheth his aſſiſtance from him:
where as the inward aſſiſtance of another unſound branch is
ſtrengthened and ſupported by pride, and ſelfe ſufficiencie of
gifts and parts, and not derived by faith, and maintained by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in Chriſts ſtrength to act all in them; ſo that, as it is ſaid
of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they <hi>raigned, but without us,</hi> ſayes <hi>Paul.</hi>
So I may ſay, <hi>Temporaries</hi> performe duties, and pray, but as
<hi>without Chriſt.</hi> But all true Beleevers are emptied firſt of their
owne ſtrength and ability, and ſo walk as thoſe who can <hi>doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without Chriſt,</hi> as thoſe who are not able to love, beleeve
one moment more without him. So <hi>Phil. 4. 13. I am able to doe
all things,</hi> but <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> And this they
lay for a principle in their hearts which they walk by, which
therefore Chriſt preſſeth upon his Diſciples here, as the maine
requiſite and fundamentall principle of Evangelicall Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Without me ye can doe nothing.</hi> And therefore ſuch an
one is ſenſible of that curſed ſelfe ſufficiencie in him, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
himſelfe, checks himſelfe for it, as for as great and foule
a ſin as any other; and humbleth himſelfe not onely for the
want of what life, and ſtirring, &amp;c. ſhould have been in the duty
fell ſhort of, in performing it; but alſo for that he ſanctified not
Chriſt, in the ſtrength he received to doe it with: But another
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56064:11"/>
doth not ſo; if he finds ſtrength, and power, and vigour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
and quickneſſe in the performance, he lookes no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
That <hi>poore</hi> man in the Goſpel, as he acknowledged his
want of faith, that he had much unbeliefe in him, ſo he goes out
to Chriſt for the ſupply, <hi>Lord h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lp my unbeliefe,</hi> for he knew that
it was <hi>he</hi> was to be the worker of every degree of faith in him.
And again, a true beleever being thus ſenſible of his own unability,
doth (when he is any thing aſſiſted) attribute all to Chriſt when
he hath done; and honours him as the <hi>Author</hi> of it in himſelfe;
confeſſeth in his heart, between Chriſt and himſelfe, that it was
not he, but Chriſt that ſtrengthned him: <hi>It is not I,</hi> (ſayes the
Apoſtle) <hi>but the grace of God in me, though I have laboured more
then they all.</hi> But another, though he receives all, yet not being
emptyed of himſelfe, <hi>boaſteth</hi> as if <hi>he had not received it.</hi> As the
<hi>Phariſee,</hi> though he <hi>thanked God</hi> in words, yet in his heart at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
all to himſelfe; ſuch an one is the more full, and lift up
when he hath done, but the true branch more empty and humble.
A true beleever glories not of himſelfe as in <hi>himſelfe,</hi> but onely
as <hi>he is a man in Chriſt;</hi> and that <hi>as a man in Chriſt,</hi> he did thus
or thus; as <hi>Paul</hi> did, and no otherwiſe. So 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 2. I knew
a man in Chriſt, &amp;c. of ſuch a man I will glorie, but of my ſelfe I
will not glorie.</hi> And yet it was himſelfe he ſpake of, but yet not in
himſelfe as of himſelfe, <hi>but as he was in Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if it be asked,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> whether in every act a Chriſtian doth
thus?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> It is in this as in that other parallel to this,<note place="margin">Whether in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very act a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever doth all in Chriſt.</note> 
                     <hi>The
making God a mans end:</hi> Now as it doth not require, that in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
action a man ſhould actually think of <hi>that</hi> his end, whilſt yet
habitually he makes it his aime: (as a man in his journey, doth
not think of the place he goes into every ſtep he takes, yet ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually
hath it in his thoughts, as he keeps in the way to it.) Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to this is it in <hi>doing all in Chriſt,</hi> it cannot be ſuppoſed that
in every act a man hath ſuch a diſtinct thought of recourſe to
Chriſt; but at the beginning and entrance of greater actions, he
ſtill hath ſuch actings and exerciſe of faith; And alſo often, in
the progreſſe he reneweth them, and in the concluſion, when he
hath performed them, he doth ſanctifie Chriſt in his heart, by
aſcribing the praiſe of all unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56064:12"/>
If in the ſecond place,<note place="margin">2. Queſt.</note> the queſtion be,<note place="margin">Whether all Beleevers doe diſtinctly fetch vertue from Chriſt by faith.</note> Whether, every true
beleever doth from his firſt converſion thus diſtinctly and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
(to himſelf) fetch thus all power from Chriſt, and doe all
in him?</p>
                  <p>The anſwer is, 1. That to all beleevers this principle of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
recourſe to Chriſt for acting their Sanctification,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> may (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
not preſently be ſo diſtinctly revealed as it hath been to ſome;
this indeed is common and abſolutely neceſſary to all beleevers,
to conſtitute and make them ſuch; namely, that their faith
ſhould have recourſe to Chriſt, and to take him for their <hi>Salvation,</hi>
in the large and generall notion of it, as it infolds all under it that
is to be done to ſave them; and thus many more ignorant doe,
when yet they have not learnt explicitely in every particular that
concerneth their ſalvation, to have frequently a diſtinct recourſe
unto him: it is probable that theſe very Diſciples of Chriſt (who
yet ſavingly beleeved) had not this particular principle of <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth all their fruit of holineſſe in Chriſt,</hi> as their <hi>root,</hi> untill this
very time and Sermon whereby Chriſt enformed them in it, ſo
clearly revealed to them, nor till then ſo clearly apprehended by
them; for ignorant they were of, and negligent in having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to Chriſt in many other particulars, and making uſe of
him therein, which are of as much concernment as this. They had
not ſo diſtinctly and explicitely (as would ſeem) put their prayers
up in Chriſts name, <hi>Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name,
John 16. 24.</hi> Neither had they ſo frequently exerciſed faith <hi>on
Chriſt</hi> in all things as they had <hi>upon God.</hi> Therefore <hi>John 14. 1.</hi> he
calls upon them, <hi>Ye beleeve in God, beleeve alſo in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Many ſorts of principles beleevers hearts may ſecretly have
been taught, which alſo habitually they practice, and yet they
may be exceeding hidden and latent in them in reſpect of their
own diſcerning them; as was the caſe alſo of theſe Diſciples,
<hi>John 14. 4.</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>The way</hi> (namely, to heaven) <hi>ye know:</hi>
and yet, <hi>ver. 5. Thomas ſayes, How can we know the way?</hi> and
then, <hi>ver. 7.</hi> Chriſt ſayes of them againe, that <hi>They knew him and
the Father;</hi> and yet <hi>ver. 8. Philip</hi> again ſaith to him, <hi>Lord, ſhew us
the Father,</hi> ſpeaking as if they were ignorant of him, for Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
him, <hi>ver. 9.</hi> and tels him he had <hi>both ſeen him and his Father.</hi>
Thoſe principles of Atheiſme and <hi>unbelief,</hi> (as thoſe <hi>ſayings in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56064:12"/>
the heart, that there is no God, &amp;c.</hi> of which the Scriptures ſpeak ſo
much) they are the principles that act and work all in men that
are wicked and carnall, and are the encouragers and counſellers
to all the ſins committed by them, and yet they are leaſt of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
by them, of all other corruptions, for they are ſeldome or
never drawn forth into diſtinct propoſitions, or actually thought
upon; but doe lie as common principles taken for granted, and
ſo do guide men in their wayes. And thus it is and may be long
with ſome of the contrary principles of faith, they may act all
ſecretly in the heart, and yet not be diſcerned; untill called
forth by the miniſtery of the Word, or ſome diſtinct informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when it comes more diſtinctly to clear ſuch a practice to
them.</p>
                  <p>Neither 3. is <hi>union</hi> with <hi>Chriſt</hi> preſently cleared up to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Union with Chriſt</hi> is not cleared up to all in Chriſt.</note> which whilſt it is darkly and doubtfully apprehended
by them, Chriſts <hi>communication</hi> of his grace and ſtrength to them
in every action, remains doubtfull alſo, and is not diſcerned by
them. Of theſe Diſciples Chriſt ſayes, <hi>John 14. 20. That in that
day</hi> (namely, when they received <hi>the Comforter</hi> more fully, of the
promiſe of whom he there ſpeaks) <hi>they ſhould know that they were
in him, and he in them:</hi> But not ſo clearly was this as yet appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by them; and ſo likewiſe that <hi>intercourſe</hi> betwixt Chriſt
and them, both for grace and comfort, &amp;c. was not ſo clearly
diſcerned by them, though continually maintained by him in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing
all grace and power to them.</p>
                  <p>And yet 4. in the mean while take the loweſt and pooreſt
beleever,<note place="margin">Yet every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever doth five things which are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>bring forth fruit in Chriſt.</hi>
                     </note> and he doth theſe five things, which put together, is
<hi>really</hi> and <hi>interpretatively a bringing forth</hi> their <hi>fruit in Chriſt,</hi>
though not in their apprehenſions.</p>
                  <p>1. In that their hearts are trained up in a continuall ſenſiblenes
of their own inſufficiencie and inability for any good thought or
word, as of themſelves; for <hi>poverty of ſpirit,</hi> to ſee their own
<hi>nothingneſſe,</hi> in this reſpect is the firſt Evangell grace, <hi>Mat. 5. 1.</hi> and
and if the contrary would ariſe in them, to think through habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
grace alone received, they were able of themſelves to doe
good, it is checked ſoone, and confuted by their owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
both of their owne weakneſſe, being ſure to be left to
themſelves, (as <hi>Peter</hi> was) when confident in his own ſtrength;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56064:13"/>
as alſo by thoſe various <hi>blowings of the Spirit</hi> in them <hi>as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth;</hi>
with which when their ſailes are filled, they <hi>are able to doe
any thing,</hi> but when withdrawn, they lay wind-bound, (though
all habits of grace be hoyſt up and ready) and not able to move
of themſelves. Now this principle of ſelf emptineſſe habitually
to live by it, no carnall heart in the world hath it, or doth live
by it.</p>
                  <p>And 2. for this aſſiſtance, they are trained likewiſe up (from
the firſt) to have a continuall dependance, from a power from
above, (without which they find they <hi>are able to do nothing)</hi> to
come from God, and from the Spirit of Chriſt; with a renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of themſelves, which implicitely is the ſame with this
immediate intercourſe with Chriſt, and is really equivalent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
though they hit not at firſt haply on the right explicite no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof (as having not been taught it by the Miniſtery of
the Word, or other wayes) in that diſtinct manner that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doe: and yet in <hi>honouring</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt</hi> dwelling in
them, they <hi>honour Christ,</hi> who ſends that Spirit into their hearts,
even as in <hi>honouring the Sonne,</hi> Chriſt ſayes, <hi>that we honour the
Father alſo:</hi> although our thoughts may ſometimes more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
be exerciſed towards one of the three Perſons more then
to another.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, when they are once taught from the Word, that
it is the duty of a Chriſtian, and part of the <hi>life of faith,</hi> to live
thus in Chriſt, and to bring forth all in him and ſo come di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
to apprehend this, as requiſite to a right bringing forth of
fruit, then their hearts inſtantly doe uſe to cloſe with the truth
of it, as being moſt ſuitable and agreeable to that holy frame of
their own ſpirits, which are Evangelically wrought to glorifie
Chriſt all manner of wayes that ſhall be revealed; there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
a preparedneſſe in their faith to make Chriſt their <hi>All in
all,</hi> as any particular comes to be revealed to them, wherein they
ought to exalt him in their hearts; and ſo this being once revealed
to be one way whereby they are to honour him, if they have gone
on afore in a confidence on their own graces, <hi>henceforth they doe
ſo no more,</hi> yea they humble themſelves as much for ſo robbing
Chriſt of glory, or neglecting of him, in not having had that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
recourſe to him, as for any other ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56064:13"/>
And 4. though haply after all this, yet ſtill their union with
him is not cleared to them, and ſo their communion with him
herein (as muſt needs) doth ſtill remain dark alſo, they therefore
neither diſcern that they have any true communion with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
nor can ſay how ſtrength comes from him; yet having bin
thus taught to fetch all from him, as was formerly explained,
they do in a continuall renunciation of their own ſtrength, deny
all offers of aſſiſtance from any other ſtrength, as namely that
which their gifts and parts would make; (even as they deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
luſts or by-ends) and they ſtill have their eyes upon Chriſt,
to work in them both the <hi>will and the deed,</hi> and ſo <hi>by a faith of
Recumbencie,</hi> or caſting themſelves on him for ſtrength in all,
(ſuch as they exerciſe towards him for juſtification, <hi>Gal. 2. 16.)
they live by faith on the Son of God,</hi> and have thereby ſuch a kind
of faith, a continuall recourſe unto him. Upon which acts of
true faith being exerciſed by them towards him, He (as he is
pleaſed to diſpence it) moves them, and works and acts all in
them; although ſtill not ſo ſenſibly unto their apprehenſions, as
that they ſhould diſcern the connexion between<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the cauſe and
the effect; nor can they hang them together, that is to ſay,
know <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> this vertue doth come from Chriſt, becauſe
their union with him is as yet doubtfull to them; and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the power that worketh in Beleevers is ſecret; and like that
of the heavens upon our bodies, (which is as ſtrong as that of
phyſick, &amp;c.) yet ſo ſweet and ſo ſecretly inſinuating it ſelfe with
the principles of nature, that as for the conveyance of it, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible,
and hardly differenced from the other workings of the
principles of nature in us: and therefore the Apoſtle prayeth for
the <hi>Ephſians, That their eyes may be enlightned to ſee the power
that wrought in them, Eph. 1. 18. 19.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet ſo as 5. their ſoules walk all this while by theſe two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
firmly rooted in them; both 1 <hi>That all good that is to be done,
muſt and doth come from Chriſt, and him alone;</hi> and 2 <hi>That if any
good be done by them, it is wrought by him alone,</hi> which doe ſet their
ſouls a breathing after nothing more then to <hi>know Chriſt in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of his reſurrection:</hi> And having walkt thus in a ſelfe-emptines
and dependance upon Chriſt by way of a dark recumbencie, when
once their union with him comes to be cleared up unto them,
they then acknowledg as they <hi>Eſ. 26. That he alone hath wrought all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56064:14"/>
their workes in them,</hi> that they are nothing, and have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and though before this revelation of Chriſt, (as Chriſt ſaid
to <hi>Peter, What I doe now thou knoweſt not, but thou ſhalt know,</hi> ſo)
they knew not then that Chriſt had wrought all in them, yet then
they know it, and when they doe know and diſcern it, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it with the greateſt exaltation of him, they having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
even during all that former time of their emptineſſe, the
glory for him alone; ſtaying as <hi>Joab</hi> did for <hi>David,</hi> till Chriſt
come more ſenſibly into their hearts, to ſet the crown of all upon
his head.</p>
                  <p>This I thought good to adde, to clear this point, leſt any poor

his juſtifying grace by Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and clear the truth
of it to all our hearts. When the Apoſtle, long after his firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
was in the midſt of that great and famous battail, chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicled
in that 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> wherein he was led <hi>captive to a Law,</hi> and
an army of ſinne within him, <hi>warring againſt the law of his minde,</hi>
preſently upon that wofull exclamation and outcry there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<hi>Oh miſerable man that I am, &amp;c.</hi> he falls admiring the
grace of juſtification through Chriſt, they are his firſt words
after the battail ended, <hi>[Now]</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>there is no condemnation
to them that are in Chriſt:</hi> Mark that word <hi>[Now]</hi> that <hi>now</hi> after
ſuch bloudy wounds and gaſhes there ſhould yet be no <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
this exceedingly exalts this grace, for if ever (thought he)
I was in danger of condemnation, it was upon the riſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling
of theſe my corruptions, which when they had carried me
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56064:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
captive, I might well have expected the ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to have followed, but I finde, ſayes he, that God ſtill par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
me, and accepts me as much as ever, upon my returning
to him; and therefore I doe proclaim with wonder, to all the
world, that Gods juſtifying grace in Chriſt is exceeding large
and rich. And though there be <hi>many corruptions in thoſe</hi> that are
in Chriſt, yet there is <hi>no condemnation to thoſe</hi> who are in Chriſt,
<hi>that walk after the Spirit,</hi> though fleſh be in them: And this at
once both <hi>clears</hi> our juſtification by Chriſts righteouſneſſe alone,
and alſo <hi>magnifies</hi> and extols it.</p>
                  <p>It clears it, therefore how doth this remaining of corruptions
afford to our Divines that great demonſtration againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
that we are not juſtified by works, nor are thoſe workes
perfect, (which they ſo impudently affirme againſt their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience)
even becauſe corruption ſtains the beſt, and <hi>our beſt
righteouſneſſe is but as a menſtruous cloth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as it clears it, ſo likewiſe it <hi>extols</hi> it: For how is Grace
magnified, when as not only all the ſins and debts a man brought
to Chriſt to pardon at firſt converſion are pardoned, but after
many relapſes of us, and provings bankrupt, we are yet ſtill ſet
up againe by free grace with a new ſtock; and though we ſtill
run upon new ſcores every day, yet that theſe ſhould ſtill be
paid, and there ſhould be riches of love enough, and ſtock e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that is, <hi>merit</hi> enough to hold out to pardon us, though
we remained in this mixt condition of ſinning, to eternity, this
exceedingly advanceth the abounding of this grace.</p>
                  <p>2. It ſerves exceedingly to illuſtrate the grace of perſeverance,
and the power of God therein; for unto the power of God is
our perſeverance wholly attributed. 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 5. Ye are kept (as
with a garriſon)</hi> as the word ſignifies, <hi>through the power of God
unto ſalvation.</hi> And were there not a great and an apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of miſcarrying, ſuch a mighty guard needed not; There is
nothing which puts us into any danger, but our corruptions that
ſtill remain in us, which <hi>fight againſt the ſoul,</hi> and endeavour to
overcome and deſtroy us. Now then to be kept maugre all
theſe; to have grace maintained; a ſpark of grace in the midſt
of a ſea of corruption; how doth this honour the power of
God in keeping us? As much in regard of this our dependency
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56064:15"/>
on him in ſuch a condition, as hee would otherwiſe be by our
ſervice, if it were pepfect, and we wholly free from thoſe
corruptions. How will the <hi>grace of God</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over the <hi>grace</hi> given <hi>Adam</hi> in his <hi>innocencie?</hi> when <hi>Adam</hi>
having his heart full of inherent grace, and nothing inwardly, in
his nature, to ſeduce him, and the temptation that he had, being
but a matter of curioſity, and the pleaſing his wife, and yet
he fell: When as many poore ſouls under the ſtate of grace,
that have but mites of grace in compariſon, and worlds of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
are yet kept, not onely from the unneceſſary pleaſures
of ſin in time of proſperity, but hold out againſt all the threats,
all the cruelties of wicked perſecutors in times of perſecution,
which threaten to debar them of all the preſent good they
enjoy? And though Gods people are foyled often, yet that
there ſhould ſtill remaine <hi>a ſeed within</hi> them, 1 <hi>John. 3. 9.</hi> this
illuſtrates the grace of Chriſt under the Goſpel. For one act
in <hi>Adam</hi> expelled all grace out of him, when yet his heart was
full of nothing elſe. Were our hearts filled with grace perfectly
at firſt converſion, this power would not be ſeen. The Angels
are kept with much leſſe care, and charge, and power then we,
becauſe they have no bias, no <hi>weights of ſin,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks)
hung upon them to draw them aſide, and <hi>preſſe them downe,</hi> as
we have.</p>
                  <p>Neither 3. would the confuſion of the devill in the end be
ſo great, and the victory ſo glorious, if all ſin at firſt converſion
were expelled. For by this meanes the devill hath in his aſſaults
againſt us, the more advantages, faire play, (as I may ſo ſpeak)
faire hopes of overcomming; having a great faction in us,
as ready to ſinne as he is greedy to tempt; And yet God
ſtrongly carries on his owne worke begun, though ſlowly, and by
degrees, backeth and maintaines a ſmall partie of grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us, to his confuſion. That as in Gods outward goverment
towards his Church here on earth, he ſuffers a great party, and
the greater ſtill by farre, to be againſt his Church, and yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
it, and <hi>rules amongst the midſt of his enemies, Pſal. 110. ult.</hi>
ſo doth he alſo in every particular beleevers heart. When
grace ſhall be in us but as a <hi>ſparke,</hi> and corruptions as much
<hi>ſmoake</hi> and moiſture damping it; Grace but as a <hi>candle</hi> and that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56064:15"/>
in the ſocket, among huge and many winds, <hi>Then to bring judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
forth to victory,</hi> that is a victory indeede.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as God doth it to advance his owne grace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the devil, ſo for holy ends that concerne the Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
As,</p>
                  <p>1. To keep them from <hi>ſpirituall pride.</hi> He truſted the Angels
that fell, with a full and compleat ſtock of grace at firſt, and
they, though raiſed up from nothing a few dayes afore, fell into
ſuch an admiration of themſelves, that heaven could not hold
them, it was not a place good enough for them; <hi>[They left]</hi>
(the text ſayes) <hi>their owne habitation and firſt eſtate, Jude, ver. 6.
Pride was the condemnation of the devill, 1 Tim. 3. 6.</hi> But how much
more would this have beene an occaſion of pride to a ſoule that
was full of nothing but ſin the other day, to be made <hi>perfect</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently?
perfectly to juſtifie us the firſt day by the righteouſneſſe
of another, there is no danger in that, for it is a righteouſneſſe
without us, and which we cannot ſo eaſily boaſt of vainly; for
that faith that apprehends it, empties us firſt of our ſelves,
and goes out to another for it. But Sanctification being a work
wrought in us, we are apt to dote on that, as too much upon
excellencie in our ſelues; how much adoe have poore belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
to keepe their hearts off from doting upon their owne
righteouſneſſe, and from poring on it, when it is (God wot) a
very little? They muſt therefore have ſomething within them
to pull downe their ſpirits, that when they look on their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
they may looke on their <hi>feet,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayes are ſtill
<hi>defiled, John 13. 10.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. However, if there were no ſuch danger of ſpirituall pride
upon ſo ſudden a riſe, (as indeed it befalls not infants, nor ſuch
ſoules as dye as ſoone as regenerated, as that good thiefe) yet
however <hi>God</hi> thinkes it meet to uſe it as a means to humble his
people this way: even as <hi>God</hi> left the <hi>Canaanites</hi> in the land,
<hi>to vexe the Iſraelites,</hi> and to humble them. And to have beene
throughly humbled for ſin here, will doe the Saints no hurt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
they come to heaven, it will keepe them <hi>Nothing</hi> for ever,
in their owne eyes, even when they are filled brim full of grace
and glory.</p>
                  <p>For 1. nothing humbles ſo as ſinne. This made him cry out,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56064:16"/>
                     <hi>Oh miſerable man that I am! He</hi> that never flinched for outward
croſſes, never thought himſelfe miſerable for any of them, but
<hi>gloried in them, 2 Cor. 12.</hi> when he came to be <hi>led captive by ſinne</hi>
remaining in him, cryes out, <hi>Oh miſerable man!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And 2. it is not the ſinnes of a fore-paſt unregenerate eſtate,
that will be enough to doe this throughly: For they might be
lookt upon, as paſt, and gone; and ſome waies be an occaſion
of making the grace after converſion the more glorious: but
preſent ſenſe humbleth moſt kindly, moſt deeply, becauſe it is
freſh, and therefore ſayes <hi>Paul, Oh miſerable man that [I am.]</hi>
And againe, we are not able to know <hi>the depth,</hi> and <hi>height</hi> of
corruptions at once; therefore we are to know it by degrees:
And therefore it is ſtill left in us, that after we have a ſpirituall
eye given us, we might experimentally gage it to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
and be experimentally ſtill humbled for ſinne: And
<hi>experimentall humbling</hi> is the moſt kindly, as <hi>pity</hi> out of <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
is.</p>
                  <p>And 3. God would have us humbled by ſeeing our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon him for inherent grace; And how ſoone are we apt
to forget we have received it; and that in our natures <hi>no good
dwells?</hi> Wee would not remember, that our nature were a <hi>ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother</hi>
to grace, and a naturall <hi>mother</hi> to luſts, but that we ſee
weeds ſtill grow naturally of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And 4. God would have us not onely humbled by ſuch our
dependance on him, but by a ſenſe of our continuall obnoxiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to him, and of being in his lurch; and therefore leaves cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
ſtill, that we might ever acknowledge that our necks
doe even lie on the block, and that he may chop them off, and
to ſee that <hi>in him, we</hi> ſhould <hi>not onely live,</hi> and <hi>move</hi> as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
but further, that <hi>by him</hi> we might juſtly <hi>be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
every moment, this humbles the creature indeed, <hi>Ezek.
36. 31, 32.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. As thus to <hi>humble</hi> them, ſo that they might have occaſion
to <hi>deny themſelves:</hi> Which to doe is more acceptable to God,
then much more ſervice without it; and therefore the great
promiſe of <hi>having an hundred fold,</hi> is made to that grace. It was
the great grace, which of all other Chriſt exerciſed. Now if we
had no corruption to entice and ſeduce us, what opportunities
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56064:16"/>
were there for us, thus of denying our ſelves? Chriſt indeed had
an infinite deale of glory to lay downe, not ſo we: unleſſe there
be a <hi>ſelfe</hi> in us, to ſolicite us, and <hi>another ſelfe</hi> to deny thoſe ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations,
wee ſhould have no occaſions of ſelf-denyall, or the
exerciſe of any ſuch grace. Therefore <hi>Adam</hi> was not capable of
any ſuch grace, becauſe he had no corruption to ſeduce him. And
therefore a little grace in us, denying a great deale of corruption,
is in that reſpect, (for ſo much as is of it) more acceptable then
<hi>his</hi> obedience. Though we have leſſe grace, yet in this reſpect of
a higher kind in the exerciſes of it.</p>
                  <p>To be meek and charitable to thoſe who fall into ſin,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. 1.</note> as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
corruption is not fully yet purged out of thy ſelfe. This is
the Apoſtles admonition upon this ground, <hi>Gal. 6. 1. If a man
be overtaken in a fault,</hi> (he ſpeaks indefinitely, that any man may)
if it be but an <hi>overtaking,</hi> not a ſinning wilfully, and obſtinately,
but <hi>a falling by occaſion,</hi> through raſhneſſe, ſuddenneſſe, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of temptation, &amp;c. <hi>ye which are ſpirituall, reſtore ſuch a man
with the ſpirit of meekneſſe, conſidering thy ſelfe, leſt thou alſo be
tempted.</hi> He would have every man be meek in his cenſure, and
in his reproofe of ſuch an one, and reſtore him, and <hi>put him in
joynt againe,</hi> as the word ſignifies; for ſtill he may be united to
Chriſt, as a bone out of joynt is to the body, though for the time
rendred thereby unuſefull; and do this, ſayes he, with tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and pity, with the ſpirit of meekneſſe, which a man will not
doe, unleſſe he be ſenſible of his owne frailty, and ſubjection to
corruption; unleſſe he reflect on himſelfe, and that ſeriouſly
too: <hi>[conſidering]</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle there, as implying more
then a ſlight thought, (I may chance to fall alſo) but the ſeeing
and weighing what matter of falling there is in thine own heart,
if God but leave thee to thy ſelfe a little then; this works a
<hi>ſpirit of meekneſſe</hi> towards ſuch an one: For meekneſſe and pity
is moſt kindly, when we are ſenſible of the like in our ſelves, and
make it our owne caſe. And this he ſpeakes to the moſt <hi>ſpirituall</hi>
Chriſtians, not to thoſe who are as yet but <hi>as carnall,</hi> (as he
ſpeaketh of the <hi>Corinthians)</hi> Chriſtians newly converted, who
(finding their corruptions at the firſt ſtounded with that firſt
blow of mortification given them, and though but in part killed,
yet wholly in a manner for a while laid aſleep, and having not as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56064:17"/>
yet, after their late converſion, had a freſh experience of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and temptations a man after converſion in his progreſſe is
ſubject to) are therefore apt to imagine they ſhall continue free
from aſſaults, and think not that their luſts will get up againe,
and ſo are prone to be more cenſorious of the falls of others:

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56064:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
expreſſed to us. God profeſſeth himſelfe the Keeper <hi>of a
Vineyard</hi> his Church, <hi>ver. 2, 3. I the Lord doe keep it,</hi> and <hi>ver. 6.
He ſhall cauſe them that come of Jacob to take root, Iſrael ſhall
bloſſome and bud, and fill the earth with fruit.</hi> But Iſrael having
corruption in him which would hinder his growth, he muſt be
lopt and cut. And ſo in the next verſes, God is ſaid to deale
with him; but not ſo as to cut them off, as he doth others that
are both his and their enemies. <hi>Hath he ſmitten them as he ſmote
thoſe that ſmote him?</hi> No. <hi>For in meaſure when it ſhooteth forth,
thou wilt debate with it.</hi> When Iſrael is but a tender plant, and
firſt ſhooteth forth, he doth but in meaſure debate with it, that
is, in ſuch a proportion as not to deſtroy it, or cauſe it to wither,
but that it may bloſſome more, he meaſures out, as it were,
afflictions to them, but <hi>ſtayes his rough wind,</hi> as it followes; that
is, ſuch afflictions as would ſhake that his plant too much, or
quite blow it downe; but ſuch a wind as ſhall make it fruitfull,
and blow away its unkindly bloſſomes and leaves: ſo much and
no more will <hi>He</hi> let out of his Treaſury, even he who holds the
winds in his fiſts, and can moderate them as he pleaſeth. For his
ſcope and purpoſe is nothing leſſe then to cut off <hi>Jacob,</hi> both root
and branch, becauſe of corruptions and ſinnes that doe cleave to
him. <hi>But this is all the fruit to take away the ſinne,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>ver. 9.</hi>
that is, this is the fruit of that winde, and of all theſe his dealings
with them: and it is <hi>[All] the fruit,</hi> that is, all that he intends
thereby, even to purge them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But doth he deale ſo with others? No, for</hi> the boughs of
the moſt fenced City wither, and are broken off and burned,
<hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> becauſe in Chriſt God accepts a little good, and it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
him more, then ſin in his doth diſpleaſe him: And therefore
as in nations he will not deſtroy the righteous with the wicked,
ſo nor in men will he caſt away their righteouſneſſe that is in
them for a little wickedneſſe ſake, but will rather purge out the
one, and ſo preſerve the other. This we have expreſſed under
the ſame Metaphor, <hi>Eſay. 65. 8.</hi> we have in hand, <hi>Thus ſaith the
Lord, as the new wine is found in the cluſter, and one ſaith deſtroy it
not; for a bleſſing is in it:</hi> That is, looke as when a man is about
to cut downe a Vine, and his axe is even at the root of it, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56064:18"/>
one ſtanding by, ſpyes a cluſter upon it, that hath new wine in it;
which alſo argues there is ſap ſtill in the roote, which may yet
bring forth more; Oh ſayes he, deſtroy it not: even ſo ſayes
God of nations and men that feare him: of nations, where he
hath many holy ones: So there it followes, <hi>So will I doe</hi> (with
Iſrael) <hi>for my ſervants ſake I will not deſtroy them all;</hi> ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
there: and thus he likewiſe ſayes of particular men, there
is a bleſſed work in ſuch a mans heart, though mingled with much
corruption, <hi>Oh deſtroy it not.</hi> Take away the ſin if poſſible,
but cut not off the man: why ſhould his grace periſh with
his wickedneſſe? every dram of grace is precious, it coſt the
blood of Chriſt, and he will not ſuffer it to be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe he hath ordained,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> that all the <hi>fruits</hi> of his children
ſhould <hi>remain, John 15. 16.</hi> Now if they ſhould be cut off, their
fruit would wither, their work muſt periſh with them; now no
mans work ſhall <hi>prove in vaine in the Lord, 1 Cor. 15. ult.</hi> But
though the world, and all works, and luſts of the <hi>world</hi> will with
their makers come to nothing, <hi>Yet he that doth the will of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
for ever, 1 John 2. 17.</hi> As the works of Chriſt in himſelfe
are eternall, ſo his works in us are eternall alſo, becauſe they are
the fruits of what he did: <hi>He that ſoweth liberally, and gives to
the poore, his righteouſneſſe remaines for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 3.</note> becauſe he loves the perſon, and hates only the ſin,
therefore he preſerves the one, deſtroyes onely the other. <hi>This
is all the fruit to take away the ſinne.</hi> Thus <hi>Pſal. 99. 8. He forgave
the</hi> perſons, <hi>and tooke vengeance</hi> onely <hi>on their inventions.</hi> The
Covenant that is made with us in Chriſt, is not a covenant made
with works, but with perſons: And therefore though the works
be often hatefull, yet he goes on to love the perſons: And that
he may continue to love them, deſtroyes out of them what he
hates, but cutteth not them off. A member that is leprous or
ulcerous, a man <hi>loves</hi> it as it is his <hi>owne fleſh, Epheſ. 5. 29.</hi> though
he loathes the corruption and putrification that is in it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he doth not preſently cut it off, but purgeth it daily, layes
plaiſters to it to eate the corruption out: whereas a wart or a
wen that growes to a mans body, a man gets it cut off, for he
doth not reckon it as his fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 4.</note> therein God ſhewes his ſkill, that he is able to deale
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56064:18"/>
with a branch which hath much corruption in it, ſo artificially,
as to ſever the corruption, and let the branch ſtand ſtill; utterly
to cut downe, and make ſpoile of all, there is no great skill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to it; but to lop the branches in the right place, and due
time and ſeaſon, ſo as they may become fruitfull, this is from the
skill of the Husbandman. Come to unskilfull Surgeons with a
ſore leg or arme, and they ſeeing it paſt their skill, they talke of
nothing but cutting it off, and tell you it is ſo far gone, that there
is no way elſe; but come to one that is skilfull indeed, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
it is not ſo periſhed, but it may be cured, and he will try
his art upon it: And ſo doth God with branches and members
that have much corruption in them, he tryes his skill upon them,
makes a great cure of a leg or an arme, where he diſcerns ſome
ſound fleſh, though much corrupted; he can cut out the dead
fleſh, and let the ſound remaine, and ſo makes it whole in the
end.</p>
                  <p>Of comfort to thoſe who are true branches,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. 1.</note> and continue to
bring forth fruit in the midſt of of all the tryals that befall them,
that God will not ſuffer them to be cut off by their corruption:
if any thing in them ſhould provoke God to doe it, it muſt be
ſinne: Now for that, you ſee how Chriſt promiſeth that God
will take order therewith, and will purge it out of them. In the
89. <hi>Pſal. ver. 28, 29, 30.</hi> this is the covenant made with <hi>David,</hi>
(as he was a type of Chriſt, with whom the ſame covenant is
made ſure and firme) <hi>That if his ſeed forſake my Law, and walke
not in my judgements,</hi> What, preſently turne them out of
doors, and cut them off, as thoſe he meant no more to have to
doe with? What, nothing but utter rejection? Is there no means
of reclaiming them? Never a rod in the houſe? Yes, <hi>Then will
I viſit their tranſgreſſions with a rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes,</hi>
whip out their ſtobbornneſſe and ſinfulneſſe, <hi>but my loving
kindneſſe will I not take from him as I did from Saul,</hi> as it is
1 <hi>Chron. 17. 13.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the Saints conſider this, that they may return when they
are fallen, and ſubmit to him and his nature, and ſuffer him to
doe what he will with them, and endure cutting, and lancing,
and burning, ſo long as he cuts them not off; endure chaſtning,
and all his dealings elſe, knowing that all the fruit is but to take
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56064:19"/>
away the ſinne to make <hi>them partakers of his holineſſe,</hi> and if <hi>by
any meanes,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of himſelfe, as <hi>Phil. 3.</hi> be the means
what it will, it is no matter; And God, if at any time he ſeemes
to cut thee off, yet it is but as the inceſtuous Corinthian
was cut off, that <hi>the fleſh might be deſtroyed, and the ſpirit
ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of encouragement to goe on ſtill to bring forth more fruit
to God:<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. 2.</note> For if you doe, God will not cut you off, <hi>he will ſpare
you as a man ſpares his ſonne that ſerves him;</hi> he will not take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
at every fault to caſt one off. It was his owne Law,
<hi>Deut. 20. 19.</hi> that ſuch trees as brought forth fruit fit for meat,
they ſhould not deſtroy when they came into an enemies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
<hi>Doth God take care of trees?</hi> No, it was to teach us, that
if we bring forth fruit, he will not deſtroy us, if it be fruit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
fit for meat: Oakes bring forth apples, ſuch as they are,
and acorns, but they are not fit for meate; ſuch treees they
might cut down: So if thou bring not forth ſuch fruit as is for
Gods taſte and reliſh, wherein thou ſanctifieſt not God and
Chriſt in thy heart, thou maieſt and wilt be cut downe, but elſe
not; If thou beeſt betrothed to Chriſt, and he hath begotten
children on thee, feare not a bill of divorce, he will not lightly
caſt thee off: And it is a good argument to uſe to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
him to ſpare thee by all the children he hath begotten on
thee: Children increaſe love between man and wife, ſo between
Chriſt and us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct. 6.</hi> That unfruitfull branches, God in the end cuts off,
and the ſeverall <hi>degrees</hi> whereby he cuts off profeſſors that are
unfruitfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That unfruitfull branches God in the end takes away:</hi> As he did
<hi>Judas,</hi> who was here eſpecially aymed at. For proofe, take <hi>Pſal.
125.</hi> It is a Pſalme made of purpoſe to ſhew the different eſtate
of the profeſſors of Religion: Thoſe that are <hi>upright, ver. 4.</hi> he
ſaith, God will continue to doe them good, and <hi>They ſhall be at
mount Sion,</hi> and all the gates of hell ſhall not be able to remove
one of thoſe mountaines: But becauſe there are many, that like
<hi>Planets</hi> goe the ſame courſe with the other Orbes, and yet have
ſome ſecret by-way beſides of their owne, of theſe he ſayes,
<hi>Thoſe that turne aſide into crooked wayes, God will lead them forth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56064:19"/>
with the workers of iniquity:</hi> That is, in the end he will diſcover
them to be what they are: And though they goe amongſt the
drove of Profeſſors, like ſheep, yet God will detect them, either
in this life, or in the life to come, to be Goats: Though they did
not ſeeme to be workers of iniquity, yet God will leade them
forth with them.</p>
                  <p>Reaſons why God dealeth thus with them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe they diſhonour the Root which they profeſſe
themſelves to be graffed into; they profeſſe themſelves to be in
Chriſt: Now he is a fruitfull root, full of ſap, and for any to be
unfruitfull in him, is a diſhonour to him. When you ſee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull
branches upon a tree, you blame the root for it; ſo doth
the world blame the grace of Chriſt, the profeſſion of Chriſt,
yea even the root it ſelfe, for the unfruitfulneſſe of the branches.
Therefore that they may diſhonour the root no more, he takes
them away, cuts them off from that root they ſeemed to ſtand
in, and then they run out into all manner of wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> becauſe the Husbandman hath no profit by them:
<hi>Heb. 6. The ground that bringeth forth thorns,</hi> and not <hi>fruit meet
for him that dreſſeth it, is nigh to curſing.</hi> In the 8. of the <hi>Cant.</hi> it
is ſaid, <hi>Solomon had a Vineyard, and he let it out to Keepers, &amp;c.</hi>
He ſpeakes this of Chriſt, of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> was a Type, and of
his Church; and his compariſon ſtands thus: <hi>Solomon</hi> being a
King, and having many Vineyards for his Royalty, (for the
riches of antient Kings lay much in husbandry) he let them out to
Vine-dreſſers, and they had ſome gaine by them; But <hi>Solomon
muſt have a thouſand,</hi> and they <hi>but two hundred;</hi> the chiefe gaine
was to come to <hi>Solomon.</hi> So the Vineyard that God had plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here below, he lets it out to men, and they ſhall have ſome
profit by it, you ſhall all have wages for the work you doe; yet
ſo as the chiefe gaine muſt returne to God, he muſt have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
for your two hundred. But when men will have all the
gains that is in what they doe, ſet up their owne ends onely,
and the Husbandman ſhall have none, ſuch branches he takes
away, becauſe they are not for his profit, for it is made a rule
of equity, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 7. That he that planteth a Vineyard, ſhould eate
of the fruit of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe of all trees a Vine is good for nothing elſe but to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56064:20"/>
bring forth fruit;<note place="margin">Reaſ. 3.</note> as we ſee it expreſſed to us, <hi>Ezek. 15.</hi> it is
good for nothing but the fire when it becomes unfruitfull: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
trees are good for building, to make pins of, but not the
Vine: And this ſimilitude God choſe out, to ſhew that of all
trees elſe, Profeſſors, if unfruitfull, are good for nothing, their
end is to be burned.</p>
                  <p>Now if you aske,<note place="margin">The degrees of Gods cutting off unfruitfull branches.</note> How God <hi>taketh them away?</hi> The degrees
he doth it by are ſet downe here, <hi>ver. 6. If a man abide not in me,
&amp;c.</hi> that is, fall away, then 1. They are <hi>caſt out,</hi> and 2. <hi>They
wither,</hi> 3. They are <hi>gathered,</hi> 4. They are <hi>burned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, they are <hi>caſt forth,</hi> that is, out of the hearts of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
out of their company, out of their prayers, yea and out of
their ſociety by excommunication often, and many times they
caſt out themſelves, being given up to ſuch errors, as diſcover
them to be unſound: As <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Profeſſors, ſo that their fall was like to have ſhaken many
of the fruitfull branches, in ſo much that the Apoſtle was faine to
make an Apologie about their fall, <hi>Nevertheleſſe the foundation of
God remains ſure, 2 Tim. 2. 18.</hi> God gave them up to ſuch opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and hereſies, as diſcovered their hearts to be rotten and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound:
So alſo he gives theſe carnall profeſſors up to ſuch ſinnes
as will diſcover them. This was the caſe of <hi>Cain,</hi> he brought
forth ſome fruit, for he <hi>ſacrificed;</hi> yet becauſe not in ſincerity,
he envied his brother, and was given up to murther his brother,
upon which it is ſaid, that <hi>He was caſt out of the ſight of the Lord,
Gen. 4. 16.</hi> that is, caſt out of his Fathers family, and from the
Ordinances of God there enjoyed, and made a vagabond upon
the face of the whole earth, which of all curſes is the greateſt:
or elſe, as was ſaid, they of their owne accord <hi>forſake the aſſembly
of the Saints.</hi> The Apoſtle makes this a ſtep to the ſin againſt the
holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb. 10. 25.</hi> he ſaith, That when men forſake the
aſſemblies and company of the people of God, publique and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and love not to quicken and ſtir up one another, or begin to
be ſhye of thoſe they once accompanied, they are in a nigh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to that which followes in the next verſe, <hi>To ſin wilfully after
they have received the knowledge of the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, being thus <hi>caſt forth, they wither;</hi> that is, the ſap of
abilities which they once had, begins to decay; that life in holy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56064:20"/>
duties, and in holy ſpeeches, begins to be withdrawn, and their
leaves begin to fall off, they cannot pray nor ſpeake of holy
things, as they were wont. Thus it is ſaid of ſuch Profeſſors,
<hi>Jude 12. That their fruit withereth,</hi> even here in the eyes of men;
for when God caſteth them out, then he withdrawes his Spirit
from them; and then, although they come to the Ordinances,
yet they have no breathings; they come to Prayer, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God is departed, and ſo by degrees God withdraws ſap
from them, till they be quite dead. Thus he dealt with <hi>Saul,</hi>
when he had diſcovered himſelfe by ſparing the Amalekites, and
by perſecuting <hi>David,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of God departed from
him,</hi> and he withered ever after, all his gifts vaniſhed, and the
ſpirit or frame of heart he once had, departed from him. So
likewiſe they that had not <hi>gained by their talents, Mat. 25. 26.</hi> their
<hi>talents were taken from them,</hi> even in this life,, and the Spirit of
God, which reſted upon them, reſted upon ſome other that were
more faithfull.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, lying long unfruitfull, in the end it is ſaid <hi>they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</hi>
Our Tranſlation hath it, <hi>Men gather them,</hi> which either
reſpects a puniſhment in this life, that when they are caſt out
from the ſociety of Gods people, wicked men gather them, they
fall to thoſe that are naught: Popiſh perſons, or profane Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts
take them, as the Phariſees did <hi>Judas,</hi> when he caſt himſelfe
out of the ſociety of the Apoſtles. Or elſe it may in a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor
refer to the life to come; the <hi>Angels,</hi> they are the
<hi>Reapers,</hi> they <hi>gather them in the laſt day,</hi> and bind them in bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
for the fire.</p>
                  <p>So laſtly, it is ſaid, <hi>They are caſt into the fire, and</hi> they <hi>burne.</hi>
A man would think he needed not to have added that, for being
<hi>caſt into the fire,</hi> they muſt needs <hi>burne:</hi> but his meaning is,
that of all other they make the fierceſt, hotteſt fire, becauſe
they are trees moſt ſeared, and <hi>fuell fully dry,</hi> as the Prophet
ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>You then that profeſſe the name of Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. 1.</note> take heed that you
be fruitfull branches indeed. I ſay to you as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>Rom: 11. 19, 20. Becauſe of unbeliefe, they were broken off: Thou
ſtandeſt by faith, be not high minded, but feare.</hi> Take heede
that it be fruit that you bring forth, doe all for GOD,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56064:21"/>
make him your end in all, bring forth more fruit every day, let
your fruit be riper, and more ſpirituall daily, labour to ſpread,
and root your ſelves as much downward in inward holineſſe, as
you do upward in outwardprofeſſion, and purge your ſelves
continually, leſt that which is threatned here, befall you, which
are fearfull things to be ſpoken, and yet concerne many a ſoule.
The Apoſtle compares ſuch to <hi>trees twice dead, and pluckt up by
the roots.</hi> You were borne dead in <hi>Adam;</hi> ſince that you have
had perhaps ſome union with Chriſt by common graces; if your
wither againe, then you <hi>are twice dead,</hi> and therefore fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to be ſtubbed up, and caſt into the fire. And if any
ſoule begin to forſake the aſſemblies of the Saints, or be caſt out
from them, let him looke to himſelfe leſt he wither in the end,
and be twice dead, and ſo he never come to have life put into
him againe, that is, repent, and return againe: And know this,
that if you being caſt out by the Church and people of God,
break your hearts, ſo that you mourne for your ſinne, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous
Corinthian did, it is a ſigne you are ſuch branches as
God will yet make fruitfull; but if beingcaſt out you begin to
<hi>wither,</hi> as here, the end will be burning.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Rowth in Grace</hi> is the main thing held forth unto
us in theſe words; and therefore I make in the
chief ſubject of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Now as in the work of <hi>Sanctification</hi> at firſt
there are two parts, <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Vivifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
ſo our progreſſe in that work hath two
parts alſo apart to be conſidered, and both here in the Text:</p>
               <p>1. A <hi>growth</hi> in <hi>Mortification,</hi> or purging out of ſinne, <hi>He
purgeth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. A poſitive growth in <hi>holineſſe,</hi> and all the fruits of it, <hi>That
it may bring forth more fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And my purpoſe is accordingly to treat of theſe two, diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56064:22"/>
and apart by themſelves: And although purging out of ſinne
is here firſt mentioned, yet our growth in fruitfulneſſe ſhall have
the firſt place in the method of handling of them; both becauſe
growth in poſitive holineſſe, and bringing forth more fruit, is
the end and perfection of the other, and ſo chiefly intended; the
other but ſubſerving unto this, and is accordingly made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of here by Chriſt, <hi>He purgeth it, [That] it may bring forth
more fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in handling this firſt Head, I ſhall doe three things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, in generall, ſhew,</hi> That all true branches do grow in grace
and fruitfulneſſe, <hi>and the reaſons of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, propound ſuch conſiderations by way of explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as may conduce to ſatisfie the tentations of ſuch Chriſtians
as diſcern not their growth herein.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, explicate more largely <hi>by way of tryall, what it is to
bring forth more fruit,</hi> thereby further to help Beleevers to diſcern
and judge aright of it.</p>
               <p>My ſcope in this diſcourſe being not ſo much to give meanes
or motives unto growth, as helps to judge of, and try our growth,
and prevent ſuch miſtakes herein, as Chriſtians are apt to fall
into.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in generall, to demonſtrate, that all true <hi>beleevers doe
grow more or leſſe in fruitfulneſſe.</hi> I ſhall give both proofes and
reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>For proofs out of Scripture, thoſe two places <hi>Hoſea</hi> the 14. 5.
compared with <hi>Pſal. 92.</hi> where the holy Ghoſt ſingleth out the
<hi>choiceſt trees</hi> and <hi>flowers</hi> in the world, on purpoſe to expreſſe the
<hi>Saints fruitfulneſſe,</hi> and their growth therein.</p>
               <p>As firſt, to ſhew the <hi>ſudden ſpringing</hi> up of the new creature,
as it falls out upon ſome mens converſions, or upon the Saints
recovery again after falls, he compares them to the <hi>Lillie, Hoſ.
14. 5.</hi> whoſe ſtalk, though long hid in the earth, when once it
begins to feel the dew, growes up oftentimes in a night. But yet
a <hi>Lilly</hi> is but a <hi>flower,</hi> and ſoon decayes.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſecondly, ſo ſhew their <hi>perpetuity,</hi> and <hi>ſtability,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their growth, the Prophet there compares them to
the <hi>Cedar,</hi> whoſe wood rots not, proverbially put to expreſſe
immortality; <hi>Digna Cedro:</hi> And which is not onely moſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56064:22"/>
but of all trees the talleſt, and ſhoots up the higheſt.</p>
               <p>But yet thirdly, ſuppoſe the new creature be kept under, and
oppreſſed with tentations and oppoſitions, yet to ſhew that ſtill
it will grow and flouriſh again: therefore he further compareth
them to a <hi>Palme tree,</hi> which uſeth to grow, the more weight is
hung upon it, and ſprouts again, even when it is cut downe to
the roots.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to ſhew that they grow with all kinds of growth:
therfore the Prophet expreſſeth their growth both by the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their root, and alſo of the branches, and ſo in a growth
both upward and downward, <hi>He ſhall caſt forth his rootes as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon:</hi>
that is, grow inwardly in habituall grace in the heart,
and then outwardly <hi>ſpread forth their branches,</hi> and ſo grow in the
outward profeſſion of Gods wayes and truth, and externall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
in their lives.</p>
               <p>Neither fifthly, is it a growth meerly in <hi>bulk,</hi> but alſo in <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,</hi>
and therefore he compares them to the <hi>Olive</hi> and the
<hi>Vine,</hi> (ſo in that place of <hi>Hoſea)</hi> which are of all trees the
fruitfulleſt, and moſt uſefull to God and man, <hi>Judg. 9. 9, 13.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet ſixtly, trees have a flouriſhing time of it but for ſome
while, during which, although they may be thus green and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
yet in their age they wither and rot, and their leaves fall
off, and their fruit decayes: The holy Ghoſt therefore as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
this exception to fall out in the Saints growth, he addes,
<hi>Pſal. 92. They bring forth fruit ſtill in their old age:</hi> When nature
begins to decay, yet grace renewes its ſtrength; which if it be
wondred at, and how grace ſhould grow and multiply, the ſoile
of our hearts being a ſtepmother to it, <hi>From me,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>is
thy fruit found, ver. 8.</hi> of that 14. of <hi>Hoſea.</hi> It <hi>is God that gives this
increaſe, and I will be as the dew to Iſrael, ver. 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſons why Chriſtians doe thus grow, are drawn</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ. 1.</hi> Drawne from Chriſts being our head.</note> from Chriſt his being our Head, and we his members.
Now although clothes though never ſo gorgeous, grow not, yet
members doe. This ſimilitude the Apoſtle uſeth in two places,
to expreſſe the growth of the Saints, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 15, 16.</hi> and <hi>Col. 2. 19.</hi>
where he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is a head, from whom the whole body grows
up to him in all things.</hi> Now the conſequence of this reaſon will
many wayes appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:56064:23"/>
Firſt, if no more but that there might be a conformity of the
head and members, it was meet we the members ſhould grow, <hi>for
we are predeſtinated to be conformable to the Image of his Sonne,
Rom. 8.</hi> Now Chriſt <hi>did grow in wiſdome, Luke 1. ult. and 2. 40.</hi>
and 42. and therefore ſo muſt we.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, as he is our <hi>Head,</hi> he hath received <hi>all fulneſſe</hi> to
that every end <hi>that we might grow</hi> even to <hi>fill all in all, Epheſ. 1. ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we are empty creatures, at his firſt taking of us, <hi>Joh.
10. 10. I came,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>that they might have life,</hi> (and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo much as will keep body and ſoul together, as we ſay,
but) <hi>that they might have it more abundantly.</hi> Why is grace called
<hi>life,</hi> and of lives the moſt excellent, but becauſe it containeth
all the eſſentiall properties of life in it? Now the main proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of life are to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>grow.</hi> The Stars they have a moving
life, but they grow not; the Sun increaſeth not, for all its tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
up and down, as ſnow-balls doe: Plants they have a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
life, but they move not out of their place; but in Grace
there is both. It is an <hi>active</hi> thing, and it is a <hi>growing</hi> thing alſo;
and becauſe the more it is acted the more it grows, therefore its
growth is expreſſed by its motion.</p>
               <p>Yea thirdly, as his <hi>fulneſſe</hi> is for our growth, ſo our growth
makes up his <hi>fulneſſe,</hi> even the <hi>fulneſſe of Chriſt myſticall,</hi> though
Chriſt perſonall is full without us: therefore the ſtature that every
Chriſtian growes up to, is called, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 13. The ſtature of the
fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi> In like ſpeech to this, <hi>Eph. 1. 23.</hi> it is ſaid, that
<hi>his body is his fulneſſe:</hi> and <hi>Eph. 4. 13.</hi> the <hi>growth</hi> of theſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
is ſaid to be <hi>the fulneſſe of Chriſt:</hi> ſo that as Chriſt ſhould be
an head without a body, if he had no members, and his body a
lame body, if he wanted any of thoſe his members: ſo it would
be found a diſproportioned body, as it were, if any of theſe
members ſhould not grow to that ſtature God hath appointed
them: So that as there will be <hi>plenitudito partium,</hi> a fulneſſe of
parts, no member lacking; ſo alſo <hi>plenitudo graduum;</hi> no degree
of growth wanting in any part, <hi>that ſo Chriſt who filleth all
in all, may be fully full.</hi> And as there would be a deformity if
any one ſhould not grow, (as to have a withered member were
a diſhonour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the head) ſo to have any one grow <hi>in immenſum,</hi>
to too great a ſtature, would breed as great a deformity on the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56064:23"/>
other ſide: therefore he addes, that <hi>every member hath its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
The hand grows according to the proportion of a hand,
and ſo the reſt; and ſo in the 13. <hi>ver.</hi> he hath it, <hi>that there is a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> that every one attains to.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is taken from God the Father.</p>
               <p>Who firſt hath appointed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ. 2.</hi> From God the Fathers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</note> as who ſhall be members, ſo alſo
what growth each of theſe members ſhall attaine to: therefore
it is called <hi>an increaſing with the increaſe of God, Col. 2. 19.</hi> Other
parents appoint not what ſtature their children ſhall attaine to,
but the Lord doth, that when they meet in heaven, there may
be a proportion in the body: as all Chriſts <hi>members</hi> were <hi>written
in Gods book,</hi> ſo the growth of them alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he hath promiſed that they ſhall grow: therefore
it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 92. They ſo all bring forth fruit in their age, to ſhew
the Lord is faithfull,</hi> which reſpecteth his promiſe; for faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is the fulfilling a promiſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God the Father hath accordingly appointed meanes
to that end, principally that they might grow.</p>
               <p>As firſt, <hi>Eph. 4.</hi> it is ſaid, he hath <hi>given gifts unto men,</hi> not
that they may be converted only, but alſo to <hi>build them up for the
edifying of the body of Chriſt:</hi> he ſpeaks as if that were one maine
end. Therefore the Word is not onely compared to <hi>ſeed,</hi> that
begets men, but to <hi>milke</hi> alſo, that ſo <hi>babes may grow,</hi> and to
<hi>ſtrong meat,</hi> that <hi>men may grow,</hi> and thus that all ſorts of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
may grow. So alſo Sacraments, their principall end is growth,
and not to convert, but to encreaſe; as meat puts not life in, but
is ordained for growth, where life is already.</p>
               <p>2. He gives his Spirit, which works growth in the hearts of his
people; and by him they have a nutritive power conveyed from
Chriſt: For it might be ſaid, though there be never ſo much nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,
if they have no power to concoct it, ſtill they cannot
grow; therefore the Apoſtle ſays, that there is an <hi>effectuall working
to the meaſure of every part, Eph. 4. 16.</hi> the ſame power working in
us, which raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt from death to life, <hi>Eph. 1. 19.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt reaſon is taken from the <hi>Saints</hi> themſelves;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ. 3.</hi> From the Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> they
could not otherwiſe enter into heaven; which I take from that
place, <hi>Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye
cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> He ſpeaks this to his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56064:24"/>
Diſciples, who were converted before; but ſaith Chriſt, unleſſe
ye grow, (there being a farther meaſure appointed you of my
Father) you cannot enter into heaven. There is therefore as
great a neceſſity <hi>to grow,</hi> as to <hi>be borne againe,</hi> or elſe we cannot
enter into Heaven.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">An explication how the Saints doe grow: many conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
to ſatisfie thoſe that diſcern not their Growth.</head>
               <p>HAving given you the reaſons, I will now explicate the
point.</p>
               <p>And that chiefly for the ſatisfaction of thoſe whoſe maine
doubts and troubles about their eſtate, are occaſioned by their
want of diſcerning themſelves to grow, and ſo call into queſtion
the work begun, becauſe not carryed on ſo ſenſibly unto perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they expect and deſire.</p>
               <p>Their objections are many and divers.</p>
               <p>They ſay, when they were young, they then had more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
enlivenings, and quickneſſe of affections, more joy in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
&amp;c. that formerly they had more zeal in what they did for
the good of others, and more fruit of their labours; that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
they have ſpent more time in duties, in conference, and
hearing, &amp;c. that others ſtart up, who have more grace the firſt
day, then they have been getting many years. Yea they are ſo
far from diſcerning that they grow, that they rather think that
they fall back, and therefore fear even the truth of grace in
them, becauſe all beleevers grow.</p>
               <p>Now the ſcope of all which I ſhall ſpeak of this argument, will
tend to this, to help ſuch to diſcern and judge aright of their
eſtates herein, and to free them from ſuch miſtakes and errours
as their objections are uſually founded upon.</p>
               <p>And firſt,<note place="margin">1. Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in generall.</note> concerning this kind of tentation and trouble, let
me premiſe this one Obſervation, concerning what <hi>ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts</hi>
this temptation is apteſt to ſeize on.</p>
               <p>You all know, that there are two more eminent and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56064:24"/>
manner of converſions of Gods people uſuall in the
Church. The converſion of ſome is more ſudden and apparent,
like the bringing of <hi>Joſeph</hi> out of a dungeon, into a marvellous
glorious light. It is with a ſudden change, which therefore is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a mighty violent inundation, and land-floud of
humiliation for ſinne, encreaſed with many gracious enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and dews from heaven, which afterwards abating, and
the ſtream ſetling and growing leſſe, and comming to an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
channell, and falling but unto ſo much as the naturall ſpring
of grace (as I may ſo call it) will ſerve to feed, they then begin
to call all into queſtion for their want of growth. Others on the
contray, whoſe converſion hath been inſenſible, and carryed on
with a ſtill and quiet ſtream, and have had a more leiſurely,
gentle thaw; and their change from darkneſſe to light hath not
been ſudden; but as the breaking forth of the morning, ſmall at
firſt, and not diſcernable at what time day began then to break;
theſe on the contrary are exerciſed rather about the truth of the
work begun, about the work of converſion it ſelfe, and the right
beginning of all at firſt; but their tentations ariſe not from a want
of growth ſo much, for this to them is more evident and ſenſible,
being like the <hi>morning light which growes clearer and clearer to the
perfect day, Prov. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now obſerve the different condition of theſe two ſorts; The
former of theſe hath a more apparent work at firſt, to ſhew, as
the evidence of their eſtate, but are apt through deſertions,
neglects, and carnall preſumption to call into queſtion their
progreſſe in it, and from thence to queſtion the truth of that
firſt work begun. The other on the contrary ſees a conſtant
ſpring and ſtream increaſing, but cannot ſhew the Well-head,
or when or where the ſpring began. So that ſo apparent a
worke of grace begun, would become matter of aſſurance
to the one, but is checked with want of diſcerning growth anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to ſuch beginnings. But an apparent growth, and faſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of the building, comforts the other, but yet ſo as they
ſtill are apt to queſtion whether the foundation of ſuch a building
be well and ſurely laid; that they are going on further to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
this they clearly ſee, but whether they come in at the
right gate, or no, that is the ſcruple which exerciſeth their ſpirits.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56064:25"/>
Thus hath our wiſe God, as in the work of his providence, ſo of
his grace, <hi>ſet the one againſt the other,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, that unto
both theſe there might be occaſion of excerciſe left, that neither
might confide in any workes wrought upon them, but flie alone
to Chriſt; and that neither ſhould rejoyce againſt the other, or
be diſcontented with that way, wherein God hath dealt with
them.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place,<note place="margin">2. More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</note> there are ſome conſiderations to be added
concerning a Chriſtians <hi>diſcerning</hi> his ſpirituall growth, which
will be profitable to the thing in hand.</p>
               <p>As firſt,<note place="margin">1. Conſid.</note> that <hi>our growing in grace</hi> is a myſterie to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>faith,</hi> rather then by <hi>ſenſe;</hi> our ſpirituall life it ſelfe is
carryed along by faith, much more the diſcerning the increaſe
of it. Yea and it being carryed on by contraries, as by falls and
deſertions, and even by our own opinions of our decreaſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is rather diſcerned by faith, then ſenſe, for <hi>faith is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of things not ſeene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Conſid.</note> the eager deſire that many Chriſtians have to have
more grace, together with them, their going on to diſcerne
more and more their wants, (which in ſome reſpect is a growth)
theſe doe keepe them from thinking that indeed they doe
grow. <hi>There is</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes) <hi>that maketh himſelfe poor,
and hath great riches, Prov. 13. 7.</hi> becauſe he enlargeth his
deſires ſtill, therefore ſtill he thinks himſelf poor. So hungry
and greedy Chriſtians, looking ſtill to what they want, and
not to what they have, are ſtill complaining and unthankfull.
If thou wouldſt diſcern thy growth, doe not compare the copie
with thy writing, but rather thy writing now with thy writing
at the firſt: For this is a ſure rule, that the better thou learneſt
to write, the better copie doth God daily ſet thee; that is,
gives thee to ſee more ſtrictneſſe in the rule, and ſo ſtill mayſt
think that thou wanteſt as much, and art as far ſhort as at firſt, if
thus thou compareſt thy ſelf with nothing but thy ſight of the
rule it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The third Conſideration,<note place="margin">3. Conſid.</note> that if growth at any time be made
ſenſible, and be diſcerned by ſenſe, yet ſo as after a while it is not
ſo diſcernable as that great change was which was made upon a
mans firſt converſion: the reaſons whereof are,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:56064:25"/>
1. For at firſt converſion, the change was <hi>ſpecificall,</hi> wholly
from want of grace, unto beginnings of grace: but the change
in our growth afterwards is but <hi>graduall,</hi> that is, but addition of
more degrees onely, of ſomething of the ſame kind ſtill: and
therefore it doth not ſo eminently affect the heart, as the change
at firſt converſion doth. To be tranſlated out of a Priſon to a
Kingdome, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was, would affect more, then to have new
Kingdomes added to one that is a King already, as <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
had.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe then the newneſſe makes a great impreſſion: One
that begins anew to ſtudy any Art, his growth is ſenſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
every thing he reads is new; when as afterwards in his
reading he meets with the ſame thing againe and againe, and with
new notions but now and then, and yet he ſtudies, it may be
harder, and learns what he knew before more perfectly, and adds
new to his old.</p>
               <p>A fourth Conſideration to diſcern thy growth,<note place="margin">4. Conſid.</note> there muſt be
time allowed; <hi>For the time,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>they might have
been teachers, Heb. 5. 12.</hi> implying, they muſt have had time to
grow up to perfection. Chriſtians doe not grow diſcernably till
after ſome ſpace. The Sunne goes up higher and higher, but we
diſcerne not its progreſſe, till after an hours motion. Things
moſt excellent, have the ſloweſt growth; but ruſhes grow faſt,
but they are weaker kind of plants; herbs, and willows, and
alder-trees grow faſt, but full of pith; Oakes more ſlowly, yet
more ſolidly, and in the end attain to a greater bulk.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Conſid.</note> conſider the growth it ſelfe; there may be a great
difference thereof in ſeverall men: You heard that every man
hath a meaſure appointed to which he muſt grow, but men are
brought to this fulneſſe ſeverall wayes, which makes a difference
in their growth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Some have the advantages of others, at firſt ſetting out;
God gives them a great ſtock of grace at firſt, and that for theſe
cauſes:</p>
               <p>1. When there is a preſent uſe of them; <hi>Paul</hi> was the <hi>laſt of
the Apoſtles, borne out of time,</hi> as himſelf complaines, as one that
was ſet to ſchoole long after the reſt of the Apoſtles, and yet
came not behind any of them in grace, becauſe God was to uſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56064:26"/>
him preſently. To ſome God gives <hi>five</hi> talents, to others but <hi>two;</hi>
ſo that he that hath five, hath as much given him at firſt, as he
that had but two had with all his gains, all his life time.</p>
               <p>2. When a man is converted late, as he that came into the
Vineyard at the eleventh hour, was furniſhed with abilities to
doe as much as the reſt, for they all received but a penny.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the manner of their growth, ſome have advantage
of others.</p>
               <p>1. Some grow without intermiſſion, as that great Apoſtle,
and the Coloſſians, <hi>who from the firſt day they heard of the Goſpell,
brought forth fruit, Col. 1. 15.</hi> Others have rubs, and for ſome
time of their lives ſtand at a ſtay: And thus ſome doe, preſently
after their firſt converſion, as the Church of Epheſus, who <hi>fell
from her firſt love:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 5. ult.</note> Others in old age, as the <hi>Hebrews, who when for
the time they might have taught others, were ſo far</hi> caſt behind, that
they had <hi>need be taught againe the firſt principles</hi> of Religion.
Meaſure therefore not ſo your growth by a piece of your lives,
but by comparing your whole life together.</p>
               <p>2. Some die ſooner, and therefore God fits them for heaven
ſooner. <hi>Dorcas</hi> dyed <hi>rich in good workes, Stephen</hi> dyed <hi>full of the
holy Ghoſt, Act. 9.</hi> It is with ſeverall Chriſtians, as with ſeverall,
Planets: the Moon goes her courſe in a moneth, the Sun in a yeer,
the reſt in many years, ſo as often they that live ſhorteſt grow
faſteſt.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <head type="sub">What it is to bring forth more fruit, explicated Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
by removing many miſtakes.</head>
               <p>LEt us now ſee what it is wherein Chriſtians may be ſaid to
grow, that ſo you may be able to diſcerne <hi>what it is to bring
forth more fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this I will explicate two wayes. Firſt, negatively, what
it is not to bring forth more fruit really, though in appearance
and in ſhew it be a growth in fruit, which occaſions many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:56064:26"/>
Secondly, poſitively, what it is truly to bring forth more
fruit.</p>
               <p>For the firſt. Firſt, to grow is not onely or chiefly <hi>to grow in
gifts,</hi> or abilities, as to preach, and pray, &amp;c. but to encreaſe in
graces: in gifts onely, ſo Reprobates may grow; yea, and ſo
true Beleevers may grow, and yet not bring forth more fruit:
The Corinthians grew faſt this way in reſpect of gifts, they were
<hi>enriched in all utterance and knowledge, and came behind in no gift,
1 Cor. 1. 7.</hi> and yet he tells them, that they <hi>were babes and
carnall, Chap. 3. 2, 3.</hi> And therefore in the 12. <hi>Chap.</hi> after he had
ſpoken of gifts, and endeavouring to excell therein, (as they did)
he tells them that indeed they were things to be deſired, and
therefore exhorts them <hi>to covet the beſt gifts;</hi> but, yet, ſayes he,
<hi>I ſhew unto you a more excellent way,</hi> in the laſt <hi>ver.</hi> of that 12.
<hi>Chapter.</hi> And what was that? It followes in the 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> even
<hi>true grace, charity, love to God,</hi> and <hi>love of our brethren:</hi> A dram
of that is, ſayes he, worth a pound of the beſt fruit of gifts. And
ſo his diſcourſe, <hi>Chap. 13.</hi> doth begin, <hi>ver. 1. Though I ſpeak
with tongues of men and Angels, yet if I have not charity, &amp;c. Gifts</hi>
are given for <hi>the good of others,</hi> to <hi>edifie them</hi> eſpecially, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 7.</hi>
but Graces, as <hi>love, faith,</hi> and <hi>humility,</hi> theſe are given to ſave a
mans own ſoul; and therefore therein is the true growth: Yet
as concerning this, I will propound a Caution or two.</p>
               <p>Indeed,<note place="margin">Caution 1.</note> growth in gifts, together with growth in Sanctification
running along with it, will increaſe our account, for God will
crown his own gifts in us, if as they come from Chriſt, ſo they
be uſed in him, and for him in our intentions; but otherwiſe
they puffe up and hinder. They ſerve indeed to ſet out, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the fruit, and to help forward the exerciſe of graces; they
are good fruit diſhes, to ſet the fruit forth: But if grace grow
not with them, we bring not forth much fruit, for at beſt they
are but bloſſomes, not fruit.</p>
               <p>Again,<note place="margin">2.</note> men are indeed to indeavour to grow in theſe gifts of
memory, and inſtructing others, and conferences, &amp;c. As was
ſaid to <hi>Timothy, Let thy profiting appear to all, 1 Tim. 4. 15.</hi> and to
the Corinthians, <hi>Covet the beſt gift,</hi> eſpecially whilſt you are
young; yet we are not ſimply thereby to take an eſtimate of our
growth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:56064:27"/>
Though this let me withall adde,<note place="margin">3.</note> that often by increaſing in
grace, a man increaſeth in gifts, and for want of increaſing in
grace, gifts alſo doe decay. The Talents being uſed faithfully,
were doubled, and unfaithfully, were leſſened.</p>
               <p>And this conſideration may help to anſwer ſome doubts and
objections which ſome Chriſtians have about their growth, as
becauſe they cannot pray ſo well as others, nor doe ſo much
ſervice to the Saints as ſome doe, therefore they bring forth
leſſe fruit. Thou mayeſt bring more fruit for all that, if thou
walkeſt humbly in thy calling, and prayeſt more fervently, though
leſſe notionally, or eloqùently. By how much the more we are
humble, prize our ſelves leſſe by them; and uſe them in Chriſt,
and for Chriſt, ſeeing they come all from him: the more we are
contented to want them, and not envie others that have them;
ſo much the more fruit we bring forth, even in the want of ſuch
gifts.</p>
               <p>Againe, decay in gifts, as in old age, doth not alwayes hinder
men from bringing forth more fruit. As, although they cannot
remember a Sermon ſo well as they had wont, nor preach with
that vigour, and vivacity, and quickneſſe when they are old, nor
be ſo active, ſtirring, forward, it followes not that they bring not
forth more fruit. <hi>David</hi> when he was old, could not governe
the Kingdome, nor doe the Church that ſervice he had done
formerly, yet true fruit he might grow in, in regard of his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
carriage towards God for his own ſalvation. A Muſitian
when he is young, is able to ſing ſweetlier then when he is old;
or when his vigour decayes, his joynts grow lame, he cannot play
as he had wont; yet ſtill he may grow a better Muſitian, and have
more skill, and ſet better. Affections, the quickneſſe of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
much upon bodily ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> our bringing forth more fruit, it is not to be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſimply by our ſucceſſe towards others in the exerciſe of thoſe
gifts (though that be called <hi>fruit alſo:</hi> ſo <hi>Jer. 17. 10.</hi> they are
called <hi>the fruit of our doings:</hi> there are our doings, and the fruits
of our doings; that is, the ſucceſſe which our examples, or gifts,
or graces, have upon others; and ſo the converſion of the ſouls
of men by the Apoſtles is called by Chriſt <hi>their fruit, John 15. 16.)</hi>
yet ſimply by this we are not to reckon our growth: for in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56064:27"/>
towards others in the exerciſe of thoſe gifts (though that
be called <hi>fruit alſo:</hi> ſo <hi>Jer. 17. 10.</hi> they are called <hi>the fruit of our
doing:</hi> there are our doings, and the fruits of our doings; that
is, the ſucceſſe which our examples or gifts, or graces, have upon
others; and ſo the converſion of the ſouls of men by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
is called by Chriſt <hi>their fruit, John 15. 16.)</hi> yet ſimply by
this we are not to reckon our growth: for in ſucceſſe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of gifts, a man may decreaſe when he growes older, and ſo
ſee leſſe fruit of his labours them formerly, or haply he may be
laid aſide; ſo ſayes the Baptiſt of himſelf, <hi>I muſt decreaſe, John
3. 30. John,</hi> when Chriſt came to preach, had leſſe commings in:
And in this reſpect, old Chriſtians, and ancient Miniſters, may
decreaſe, and young ones increaſe, and yet they decay not in
grace; for there are <hi>Gods workes in us,</hi> and <hi>Gods workes with us:</hi>
Now <hi>Gods work with us</hi> in doing good to others, may be leſſe,
when yet his <hi>workes in us</hi> may be more: for as there are <hi>diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of gifts,</hi> ſo of <hi>operations, 1 Cor. 12.</hi> The holy Ghoſt may uſe
one of leſſe grace to doe more good then one of more, though
herein this caution is to be added, that he delights uſually to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thoſe of moſt ſincerity, with moſt ſucceſſe; as in that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Apoſtle, <hi>Paul, the grace of God was more in him,</hi> and ſo
wrought more with him in doing much good to others, 1 <hi>Cor.
15. 10.</hi> and <hi>God</hi> alſo <hi>will reward according to the fruit of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
as <hi>Jer. 17. 10.</hi> when our deſires are enlarged to doe much
good, and we intended and aimed to doe that good which is
done: there it is added there, in that <hi>Jer. 17. Whoſe heart thou
knoweſt.</hi> When he ſees the heart clearly enlarged to doe much
good, then the fruit that is done is reckoned him as his; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
what ever it be he doth by us, he will reward but according
<hi>to our workes,</hi> as concurrent with his. So 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 8.</hi> the Apoſtle
upon this occaſion intimates, that ſeeing it is God <hi>that gives the
increaſe,</hi> he ſayes, that <hi>God will reward men according to their [own
labours;]</hi> not ſimply according to his workes by them: as if
God doth not goe forth with a Miniſter, whoſe heart is much
ſet to doe good, and to convert ſoules, to doe ſo much good
by him as with another, who is in his own ſpirit leſſe zealous;
yet if his heart was large in deſires, and his endeavours great
to doe good, God will reckon more fruit to him then to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56064:28"/>
that had fewer endeavours, though more ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> this growth in grace, and bringing forth more fruit,
is not ſimply to be reckoned by the largeneſſe or ſmallneſſe of
thoſe opportunities which men have of doing more or leſſe
good, and ſo, By the bringing forth of more fruit, in reſpect of
more opportunities vouchſafed. Some that have more grace,
and better gifts, have their ſhop-windowes ſhut, night overtakes
them, and the <hi>power of darkneſſe,</hi> as it did Chriſt himſelfe in the
end, and then <hi>they cannot work.</hi> Others have leſſer ſhops to work
in, and yet have more grace; yea, the ſame man may have larger
opportunities when young, and leſſer when he is old, and yet
growes, and brings forth before God more fruit, becauſe he
accepts the will for the deed: So the Baptiſt was hindred in his
latter time in priſon, when yet he brought forth more fruit, and
therefore he envied not Chriſt that got all his cuſtome, his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
and Diſciples, but rejoyced that the work went forward,
though not by himſelf: here was as much grace expreſſed, as in
many Sermons. So <hi>Paul,</hi> he was much of his time in priſon, yet
then he ceaſed not to bring forth more fruit that ſhould tend to
his ſalvation, for <hi>Phil. 1. 15, 16.</hi> when as he being in priſon, he
heard others preached, and that out of envie to him, others
out of good will, <hi>I</hi> in priſon <hi>rejoyced,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>that Chriſt is
preached,</hi> though I cannot doe it my ſelfe: and <hi>I know,</hi> ſayes he,
<hi>that this ſhall turn to my ſalvation, ver. 19.</hi> Theſe fruits were as
much, and would bring him in as much glory as his preaching.
Indeed when a man ſhall prize opportunities of doing good,
and for them voluntarily let goe all opportunities of advancing
himſelf and his credit, or eaſe, or carnall advantages, then the
more fruit he brings forth in thoſe opportunities, the more is
reckoned on his ſcore.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> it is not alwayes to be meaſured by <hi>acceſſary graces,</hi>
as joy, and ſpirituall raviſhment, &amp;c. which tend to the <hi>bene eſſe,</hi>
the comfort of a Chriſtian: but it is to be eſtimated rather by
thoſe <hi>ſubſtantiall graces,</hi> as faith, humility, love, ſtrong and ſolid
affections to what is good. The other may decreaſe, when
theſe that are more ſubſtantiall doe increaſe. Theſe ſweet <hi>blooms</hi>
may fall off, when fruit comes on; though the gloſſe wear out,
no matter, ſo the ſtuffe be ſtrong and ſubſtantiall. Young Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56064:28"/>
grow like new inſtruments; they have more varniſh then
old, but not ſo ſweet a ſound. Yea, often the decreaſing of thoſe
ſuperadded graces are a means of the encreaſe of the other: want
of feeling cauſeth more exerciſe of faith, as taking away bladders
exerciſe a man to ſwim: One that hath bladders, and the ſtream
with him, ſeemes to ſwim as well and as faſt as one that hath
learned long, and hath more skill and ſtrength, but wanteth
theſe, and ſwims againſt the ſtream, yet not ſo faſt. Spirituall
withdrawings cauſe more humility, more cleaving to God. A
man, as the Leper cleanſed, haply at the firſt leaps more, but goes
as faſt afterward.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> it is not increaſing in outward profeſſing, and a ſeeming
forward, but eſpecially in inward and ſubſtantiall godlineſſe; the
other is but as increaſing in leaves; but in growth, there muſt be
a bringing forth <hi>more fruit.</hi> When the root ſtrikes not deeper
downward, and farther into the earth, but ſpreads much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the branches, this is not a true growth; though look
where there is more rooting, there will be more ſpreading alſo
above ground. Growth, it lies not in this, <hi>That men ſhould
thinke of me above what I am indeed, 2 Cor. 12. 6.</hi> Many at firſt
grow into ſo great a profeſſion, as they cannot fill up, and grow
up to all their dayes; make bigger cloathes then they can grow
to fill: As they ſay of Elephants, that the skinne is as big at firſt,
as ever after, and all their life time their fleſh growes but up to
fill their skinne up. True growth begins at the vitalls, the heart,
the liver, the bloud gets ſoundneſſe and vigour, and ſo the whole
man outwardly; this heart Godlineſſe is the thing you muſt
judge by.</p>
               <p>And yet ſixtly,<note place="margin">6.</note> even in inward affections many be deceived:
even there the party for Chriſt in appearance may be greater
then in truth. So often in a young Chriſtian, there is a greater
army of affections muſtered, but moſt of them but mercenaries:
his affections are then larger, his joyes greater, his ſorrowes vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter
then afterwards: More of his heart joynes in duties at
firſt; but afterwards, though leſſe, yet more ſpiritually and
truly. The objects being then new, draw all after them; not
onely <hi>Spirit,</hi> or that new principle of grace is ſtirred then, but
<hi>fleſh</hi> alſo. The unregenerate part becomes a <hi>Temporary Beleever
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56064:29"/>
for a time,</hi> hath a work upon it <hi>per redundantiam,</hi> as an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
man hath who is a Temporary: which work on the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
part doth decay, as in Temporaries it doth, and grows
leſſe: not onely godly ſorrow is ſtirred to mourne for ſinne,
but carnall ſorrow being awakned by Gods wrath, joynes alſo,
and ſo makes the ſtreame bigger. Infidelity it ſelfe, like <hi>Simon
Magus,</hi> for a while beleeves. Whilſt the things of grace are a
wonder to a man, (as at firſt they are) preſumption joynes and
eekes out faith; a great party <hi>in the heart cleaves by flattery,</hi>
(as the phraſe is in <hi>Daniel)</hi> and for by-ends, which after ſome
progreſſe fall off and faint in the way; and thoſe luſts that over
and above their true mortification were further caſt into a
ſwoune, begin againe to revive. All this was reſembled to us by
the comming of the Children of Iſrael out of Egypt, when by
thoſe plagues in Egypt, and <hi>Moſes</hi> his call, not onely the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
but even many of the Egyptians were wrought upon, and
began <hi>out of ſelf-love to feare the Lord, Exod. 9. 20.</hi> and ſo <hi>a mixed
multitude,</hi> it is ſaid, went out with <hi>the Iſraelites, Exod. 20. 38.
to ſacrifice to the Lord;</hi> but ere long, as <hi>Numb. 11. 4.</hi> this mixt
multitude began to murmur, and to fall off: So at a mans firſt
ſetting out, at his firſt converſion, mixt carnall affections, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
part, through the newneſſe of the objects, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of Gods wrath, and heavenly raviſhments, are wrought
upon, and goe out with the new Iſrael to ſacrifice, but after a
while theſe fall away, and then the number is leſſe; but the true
Iſraelites may be encreaſed. Hence it is, that <hi>young Chriſtians,</hi>
(if they know their hearts) <hi>complain</hi> more of <hi>hypocryſie,</hi> and <hi>old</hi>
Chriſtians of <hi>deadneſſe.</hi> So in times of peace, preſumption eeks
out faith, and makes it ſeeme a great deale, which in times of
deſertion and tryal, falls off; and then though the beleeving
partie be leſſe, yet more ſincere. When the fire is firſt kindled,
there is more ſmoke, even as much as fils the houſe; but after
the flame comes, that contracts all into a narrow compaſſe, and
hath more heat in it: So it is in young Chriſtians, their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
(which Chriſt compares to the <hi>ſmoaking flax)</hi> their joy in
duties, their ſorrow for ſinne, their love of God is more, but
exceeding carnal; the flame after, though leſſe, growes purer,
and leſſe mixt with vapours of corrupt ſelf-love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:56064:29"/>
Seventhly we muſt not meaſure our bringing forth more fruit
by one ſome kind or ſort of duties,<note place="margin">7.</note> but by our growth in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
in the univerſall extent and latitude of it, as it takes in and
comprehendeth the duties of both callings, generall and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and all the duties of a Chriſtian. Thus it may be when grown
up we are leſſe in ſome ſort of duties, then we were when we
were young Chriſtians: Haply we were more then in praying,
in faſting, and reading, and meditating, yea ſpent the moſt (if
not the whole) of our time in theſe; But becauſe now we ſpend
leſſe time in theſe, we muſt not ſay therefore that we are fallen,
or decayed: for there are many other duties to be done beſides
theſe, which haply then we neglected, but now make conſcience
of. So that take all ſorts of duties in the latitude of them, and
we may be growne more, and do bring forth more fruit. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
we bring forth leſſe fruit of ſome one kind then afore, but
if we be filled with all variety of fruits of the firſt and ſecond
table of our generall and particular callings, this is to bring forth
more fruit. Men at their firſt converſion are neceſſitated often
for to ſpend their whole time in ſuch duties wherein they
immediately draw nigh to God: <hi>Paul</hi> then ſpent three whole
dayes in faſting and prayer: And then we allow them to doe it,
becauſe their eſtates require it; they want aſſurance, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment,
they ſee grace to be <hi>that one thing neceſſary,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we give them leave to neglect all things for it; they are new
married to Chriſt, and therefore they are not to be preſſed to
war the firſt yeare, (as I may ſo allude) as for young marryed
perſons it was provided in <hi>Leviticus;</hi> and parents and maſters
are to give allowance to ſuch, then in their travell of their new
birth to lye in, and not to be cruell to them, in denying them
more time then ordinary. So alſo when they are in deſertion,
(which is a time of ſickneſſe, and in ſickneſſe you allow your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
time from their work) as the Church, when ſhe wanted
her Beloved, <hi>Cant. 3. 2.</hi> no wonder if ſhe leaves all to ſeek him:
As your ſelves, when you want a child or a ſervant, you cry him
in every ſtreet, and leave all to find him, as he left ninety nine to
find one loſt ſheep. And they then come new out of priſon, out
of their naturall eſtate, and out of the freſh apprehenſion of the
wrath of God, and therefore no wonder if they run ſo faſt to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56064:30"/>
haſte out of it, and ſalute none by the way, ſtay to doe no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
but when once they are gotten to the City of refuge, then
they fall about their buſineſſe and callings againe. Hence young
Chriſtians are apt to be more negligent in their particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and are all for the duties of Religion, for their preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
and eſtate requires it: Ancienter Chriſtians are apt to
abound more in the duties of their particular calling; but he
that hath learnt to be converſant in both aright, to be converſant
in his calling, ſo as to keep his heart up in communion with God,
and ſo attend upon God without diſtraction, and to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
ſo in duties, as to goe about his calling cheerfully, <hi>and to doe
with all his might what his hand therein finds to doe,</hi> he is the beſt
Chriſtian: And therefore 1 <hi>Theſ. 4. 10.</hi> when he had exhorted
them to encreaſe more and more in grace, he goes on, <hi>ver. 11.</hi>
to exhort them alſo <hi>to doe their owne buſineſſe, and to work with
their hands,</hi> that they <hi>may walk honeſtly towards them without:</hi> for
to neglect our callings, gives offence to them without; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
maſters ſtumble at young Chriſtians: but both, you ſee by
the Apoſtles exhortation in that Epiſtle, may ſtand together, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
in holineſſe, of which he had ſpoken afore, <hi>Chap. 3. 12.</hi>
and <hi>Chap. 4. 1.</hi> and <hi>ver. 10.</hi> with diligence in a calling, of which
he ſpeaks, <hi>ver. 11.</hi> &amp;c. To be converſant all day in holy duties,
is indeed more ſweet to a mans ſelfe, and is an heaven upon
earth: but to be converſant in our callings, is more <hi>profitable to
others,</hi> and ſo may glorifie God more: And therefore as when
<hi>Paul</hi> would gladly have been with Chriſt, (for <hi>that is beſt for me,</hi>
ſayes he) yet ſayes he, <hi>To abide here is more profitable for you,
Phil. 1.</hi> ſo to injoy immediate communion with God in Prayer,
and to meditate all the week long, is more for the comfort of
a mans particular; but to be employed in the buſineſſe of a mans
calling, the more profitable for the Church, or Common-wealth,
or Family. And therefore it is to be accounted a bringing forth
of more fruit, when both are joyned, and wiſely ſubordinated,
ſo as the one is not a hindrance to the other: though the child
out of love to his mother, and the ſweetneſſe he hath in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
could find in his heart to ſtay all day at home to look on
her; yet it pleaſeth her more for him to goe to ſchoole all day,
and at night, to come home and be with her, and play with her;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56064:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſhe then kiſſeth him, and makes much of him. Children
when they are young, they eate often, and doe little, and we
alllow them to doe ſo; afterwards you ſet them to work, and
to ſchoole, and reduce them to two good meals, and they thrive
as well with it.</p>

               <head type="sub">What it is to bring forth more fruit, explicated poſitively,
wherein many direct tryalls of Growth are given.</head>
               <p>THus I have ſhewne you negatively, what this growth is not
to be meaſured by, and ſo by way of intimation wherein
it conſiſts; I will ſecondly do it more poſitively, and directly,
and affirmatively.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Tryall.</note> we grow, when we are led on to execiſe new graces,
and ſo <hi>to adde one grace to another,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts;
as when in our knowledge we are led into new truths, and have
anſwerable affections running along with thoſe diſcoveries to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the things revealed. At firſt a Chriſtian doth not exerciſe
all graces, though all are radically in him: But as a man lives
firſt the life of a plant, then of ſenſe, then of reaſon, ſo is it in
Graces. There are many <hi>formes</hi> Chriſtians go through, as ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
at ſchoole doe, wherein their thoughts are in a more eſpeciall
manner taken up about divine objects of an higher or inferiour
nature. The firſt forme is to teach them to know their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of heart and life more; and ſo they goe to ſchoole to
the Law, and are ſet to ſtudy it, even oftentimes a good while
after converſion, and faith begun: and then after they have
learned that leſſon throughly, they are led up higher to have
their faith drawn out, and to be exerciſed about free grace more,
and towards Chriſt his perſon, union with him, and about the
art and way of drawing vertue from him, and doing all in him.
And herein it falls out with particular Chriſtians, as with the
Church in generall; that as although the moſt infant dayes of
the Church from <hi>Adams</hi> time in the old world had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all Fundamentals, neceſſary to ſalvation, yet God went
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56064:31"/>
over <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>piecemeale, Heb. 1. 1.</hi> Age after Age, to inſtruct
his Church in a larger knowledge of thoſe Fundamentals: So is
it in Gods dealing with particular Chriſtians, though a Beleever
in his converſion hath the ſubſtance of all theſe taught him, yet
he goes over them by piecemeale againe, throughout his whole
life; and hath often ſuch a diſtinct apprehenſion renewed of
them, as if he had not knowne or minded them afore: And
ſometimes his thoughts doe dwell more about the emptyneſſe
of his owne righteouſneſſe, ſometimes about that fulneſſe is in
Chriſt, ſometimes more about the ſpirituall ſtrictneſſe he ought
to walk in: And becauſe ſome are apt to give up the old work,
when they have new; hence that which is indeed but growth in
grace in them, many account to be but their firſt converſion;
though every ſuch eminent addition be to be accounted as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
as Chriſt ſpeaks to his Diſciples, <hi>Except ye be converted;</hi>
yet they were converted afore. Now the purpoſe I ſpeak this
for, is an help to diſcerne our growth; for when God thus is
leading us with farther light and affection to a larger apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſpirituall things, or to the trying new graces, ſo long we
grow. Therefore <hi>Cant. 7. ult.</hi> the Church is ſaid <hi>to lay up for her
beloved [fruits new and old:]</hi> And <hi>Rom. 5.</hi> from <hi>patience</hi> a man
is led to experience, from <hi>experience</hi> to <hi>hope.</hi> As wicked men are
led on from one ſinne to another, and ſo grow worſe and
worſe; ſo godly men from one grace to another: and when it
is ſo with us, then we encreaſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Tryall.</note> when a man finds new degrees of the ſame grace
added, and the fruits of them grow bigger and more plentifull;
as when a mans love grows <hi>more fervent,</hi> as 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 8.</hi> when
faith, from mans caſting it ſelfe on Chriſt, comes to find ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in Chriſt, which <hi>is to eate his fleſh, and drink his blood;</hi> and
then from that growes further up to an <hi>aſſurance of faith,</hi> which
is an addition to it: When any thing that <hi>was lacking in faith,</hi>
(as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Theſ. 3. 10.)</hi> is added. So when a man
grows up to more ſtrength of faith in temptations, and is leſſe
moved and ſhaken in them, more <hi>rooted</hi> in faith, as the Apoſtle
ſpeaks. Thus in godly ſorrow, when from mourning for ſin as
contrary to Gods holineſſe, we goe on to mourn for it as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to him who loves us, which followes upon aſſurance, <hi>as they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56064:31"/>
mourned over him which once they had pierced:</hi> not onely that we
mourne that we ſhould offend a God hath ſo much mercy in
him, but out of a ſenſe of it to us, which many cannot finde: ſo
when our motives to hate ſinne grow more raiſed, more ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
theſe are additions of the ſame degree. So in Prayer, when
we finde our prayers to grow more ſpirituall, as in that part of
Prayer, <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> when more ſpirituall corruptions are put into
our confeſſions; and ſo in like manner, ſtronger grounds of
faith put into deprecation, and petitions for pardon; more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largedneſſe
to thankfulneſſe; more zeale to pray for the
Churches; when we go on to <hi>pray with all prayer more,</hi> as the
Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ. 6. 18.</hi> Or in obedience, when we <hi>abound
more and more in the work of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Rev. 2. 9.</hi> it is ſaid of
that Church, that <hi>their laſt works were more then the firſt;</hi> ſo as
the boughes are laden, and <hi>we are filled with the fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
Phil. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Tryall.</note> when the fruits and duties we performe grow more
ripe, more ſpirituall though leſſe juycie; that is, leſſe affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:
and though they grow not in bigneſſe, nor in number, that
is, we pray not more, nor longer; yet they grow more ſavoury,
more ſpirituall, more compact and ſolid. It is not ſimply the
multitude of performances argue growth: When one is ſick,
and his body is decayed, he may be leſſe in duties; but it is the
ſpiritualneſſe, the holineſſe of them: One ſhort Prayer put up
in faith, with a broken heart, is in Gods eye <hi>more fruit</hi> then a
long one, or a whole day ſpent in faſting; even in the ſame ſenſe
that the <hi>widows mite,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>more then they all</hi> caſt in, <hi>Luk.
21. 3.</hi> Young Chriſtians performe more duties at firſt, and
oftner, then after; as young ſtomachs eate more and oftner.
As in nothing Sermons, ſo in performing duties, ſome will note
more words, but not more matter, becauſe with leſſe underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
young Chriſtians performe more duties, and withall ſpoile
more duties; young Carpenters make many chips: But the
more ſpirituall your performances grow, the <hi>more fruit</hi> there is
to be eſteemed that there is in them. It is not the bigneſſe of the
fruit, or juycineſſe of them, for then crabs were better then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
but the reliſh it is that gives the commendation: And it is the
<hi>end</hi> you have therein, that puts this reliſh into them: when your
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56064:32"/>
ends are raiſed more to aime at God, and to ſanctifie him more,
and to debaſe your ſelves in a ſenſe of your owne vileneſſe, and
emptineſſe, and unability; and when your obedience proceeds
more out of thankfulneſſe, and leſſe out of the conſtraint of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
As the greateſt growth of wicked men is in ſpirituall
wickedneſſe, (in which the Phariſees grew, and ſinners againſt the
holy Ghoſt doe grow, when yet it may be they leave more groſſe
evils) ſo the greateſt growth of grace is in ſpirituall holineſſe, in
ſanctifying God much in the heart, and <hi>worſhipping him in ſpirit
and truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Tryall.</note> when a man grows more rooted into Chriſt, that
is the true growth; and that which makes the <hi>fruit</hi> to be <hi>more</hi>
in Gods ſight and eſteeme: therefore <hi>Eph. 4. 15.</hi> we are ſaid <hi>to
grow up in him;</hi> that is, to live the life we lead, more out of our
ſelves and in Chriſt: as when for the acceptation of our perſons
we are emptied of our owne righteouſneſſe; ſo for ſtrength to
performe duties, we are emptied of our abilities, <hi>ſeeing without
him we can doe nothing:</hi> So when for acceptation of our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
when we have done them, our hearts have learnt habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to ſay more and more with the Apoſtle, <hi>Not I, but Chriſt in
me;</hi> when we intereſt Chriſt more and more in all we doe, as
the efficient and alſo the finall cauſe. And therefore I obſerve
when growth of grace is mentioned, it is ſtill expreſſed by <hi>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the knowledge of Chriſt:</hi> So 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 17. Grow in grace,
and in the knowledge of Chriſt;</hi> as if to grow in grace without
him, were nothing, as indeed it is not. So in the <hi>Epheſians</hi> we
are ſaid both to <hi>grow up in him, and for him.</hi> Philoſophers did
grow in morall vertues, but not in Chriſt; ſo doe Civill men and
others; Temporaries doe duties from him, but yet as in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
as the Ivie that hath ſap from the Oake, but concocts
it in its owne roote, and ſo brings forth as from it ſelfe. To doe
one duty, ſanctifying Chriſt and free grace in the heart, is more
then a thouſand: young Chriſtians, it may be, doe more works,
but not as works of grace: and the more men think by duties
to get Chriſt, and Gods favour, the more in duties they truſt,
and ſo they become as works of the Law; but the more dead a
man grows to the Law; and to live to Chriſt, and Chriſt in him;
and the more free grace is acknowledged in all, truſted in above
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56064:32"/>
all; the more Evangelicall our works are, and the more to
God, (for that is the end of the Goſpell, to honour Chriſt and
free grace) the more we grow. <hi>We are of the Circumciſion,</hi> ſayes
the Apoſtle, <hi>who rejoyce in the Lord Jeſus, worſhip God in the ſpirit,
and have no confidence in the fleſh, Phil. 4.</hi> As theſe are the ſureſt
ſigns of true grace, ſo of true Growth.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Tryall.</note> the more we learne to bring forth <hi>fruits in ſeaſon,</hi> the
<hi>more fruit</hi> we may be ſaid to bring forth: For the ſeaſonable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of them makes them more. All the fruits in their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
how acceptable are they? which out of ſeaſon, they are not.
In the firſt Pſalme a righteous man is ſaid to <hi>bring forth his fruits
in due ſeaſon:</hi> and in the <hi>Proverbs, Words in ſeaſon are as apples of
gold and pictures of ſilver.</hi> In <hi>Ezek. 41.</hi> they are ſaid <hi>to bring forth
pleaſant fruits in their moneths;</hi> as in reproving he is not ſo much
to reprove, as to reprove in ſeaſon; to have <hi>our ſenſes exerciſed</hi>
to know fit ſeaſons, and to <hi>conſider one another to provoke to love,</hi>
as it is <hi>Heb. 10.</hi> Young Chriſtians doe more, but more out of
ſeaſon, and the devill abuſeth them, putting them upon duties,
when they would be at their refreſhings, at their callings; he
deceiving them with this, that holy duties in themſelves as alone
ſimply compared, are better then to doe any thing elſe; when as
the ſeaſon adds the goodneſſe to our actions: Thus to recreate
thy ſelf at ſome ſeaſons is better then to be a praying. A <hi>righteous
man orders his converſation aright, Pſal. 50.</hi> and order gives a
rectitude, a goodneſſe to things.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6. Tryall.</note> when we grow more conſtant in performances, and
more even in a godly courſe, and ſetled in ſpirituall affections
without intermiſſion, it is a ſigne we grow. It argues that <hi>our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man is more renewed day by day,</hi> when we can walke cloſely
with God a long while together. A righteous man is compared
to the <hi>Palme tree, whoſe leafe never fades, Pſal. 1.</hi> whereas other
trees bring forth by fits: And by fits to be much in duties, is not
a ſigne of growth, but weakneſſe; it is out of inordinacie; and
of ſuch a frame are young Chriſtians hearts, like new lute ſtrings,
which when they are wound up high, are ſtill a falling ever and
anon; whereas ſtrings ſetled long on an inſtrument, will ſtand
long, and not ſlip downe.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7. Tryall.</note> a man may be ſaid to grow and bring forth more
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56064:33"/>
fruit, when although the difficulties of doing duties become
greater, and his means leſſe, yet he continues to doe them, and
this though it may be he doth no more then he did before. For
a tree to bring forth much fruit in cold weather, or ſtanding in
the ſhade, is more then in ſummer, or when it ſtands in the ſun.
<hi>I know thy work, thy labour, [and thy patience] Rev. 2. 13.</hi> When
a man though he doe fewer works, yet with much <hi>labour,</hi> having
it may be now a body growne weake; or holds out in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the wayes of God, with more ſcoffes, and hazarding
more, in a place where <hi>Satans throne is,</hi> this makes a little done
for Chriſt a great deale: So when a man thrives with a little
trading, with ſmall means of grace, and yet exceedeth thoſe that
have more; to pray, and to continue to doe ſo, though the
ſtreame is againſt us, and gales ceaſe; to pray and to continue
to pray, when we heare no anſwers but the contrary. It is noted
of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that <hi>he did the Kings buſineſſe after he had been ſick,
Dan. 8. 27.</hi> and ſo he prayed (you know) when he ventured his
life for it: when we have leſſe ſtraw to make the ſame number
of brick with; leſſe wages, leſſe encouragements, and yet doe as
much work with chearfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>8. When a man though he doth leſſe for the outward bulk,<note place="margin">8. Tryall.</note>
yet grows more wiſe and faithfull to lay out all his opportunities
and abilities to the beſt advantage, this is to bring forth more
fruit. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> who at firſt began to heare himſelfe all cauſes
both ſmall and great, but in the end he gave over the leſſer cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to others, and reſerved the hearing of the greater to himſelfe,
<hi>Exod. 18. 10.</hi> yet ſtill he continued to doe more, and laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
out to the greater advantage: His former courſe would
in the end have killed him; <hi>Thou wilt wear away like a leafe,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Jethro</hi> to him: So the Apoſtle who ſtrived to preach the Goſpell
<hi>where Chriſt had not been knowne, Rom. 15. 20.</hi> When a man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares
leſſer things to lay out all for the Churches advantage;
leſſe ventures himſelfe in a ſmaller courſe (unleſſe particularly
called to it) not out of fearfulneſſe but faithfulneſſe, and will lay
all the ſtock on it in a greater: Young Chriſtians are as young Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
they ſtrike hand over head, downe right blowes: whereas if
they would conſider their brother, or a wicked man whom they
would reprove, as skilfull fencers do, and at an advantage hit
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56064:33"/>
them a good blow, is it not much better? <hi>when a man watcheth
in all things,</hi> as he exhorts <hi>Timothy, 2 Tim. 4. 5.</hi> and <hi>ſerves the
ſeaſon,</hi> as ſome reade it, <hi>Rom. 12. 11.</hi> that is, waits for the beſt
advantages of doing good, both which may ſtand <hi>with fervencie
of ſpirit, and enduring afflictions,</hi> for ſo the next words are in both
thoſe places. A man is no leſſe liberall that ſtudies how to lay
out his money to moſt charitable uſes, though he gives leſſe to
fewer particulars. We live in a wicked world, and godly men
cannot do what they would, as wicked men alſo cannot. When
therefore a man looks about him, and ſtudies to improve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to the utmoſt advantage for God in his place, to lay out his
credit, his parts, and all for God, as a faithfull Factor in the
beſt wares, though he deales in fewer particulars, he may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
bring forth more fruit. And thus much for
matter of Tryall about the firſt thing, poſitive growth in fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>

not onely that they bring forth more fruit, but
that God <hi>purgeth them</hi> that they may bring

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:56064:34"/>
In the handling of this point, I ſhall doe theſe foure things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſet the bounds and limits of this Diſcourſe about it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Chriſts intendment, as here he ſpeaks of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, give ſome reaſons of the point.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſhew the wayes which God uſeth to carry on the
progreſſe in this work.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, give ſome helps of Tryall about it.</p>
               <p>Now for the firſt, the explication and limiting this point unto
Chriſts intendment here, that ſo I may onely ſo far handle it
as the ſcope of the words will beare, I premiſe theſe three things
about it.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>purging</hi> here intended, (which is indeed all one with
<hi>Mortification,</hi> and emptying out ſin out of our hearts and lives)
is to be reſtrained here to <hi>the progreſſe of a Chriſtian</hi> in that work,
and not as taking in with it <hi>that firſt work</hi> of mortification
wrought at a mans firſt converſion: ſo as I intend not now to
lay open to you the <hi>nature of mortification,</hi> and what it is, by way
of Common place, but onely intend to ſpeak of <hi>Growth in it:</hi>
for of <hi>that</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks, becauſe it is ſuch a purging, as is <hi>after
bringing forth ſome fruit,</hi> and whereof the end is to <hi>bring forth
more fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither 2. are we ſo much to ſpeak of it here, as it is a <hi>duty</hi>
to be done <hi>by us,</hi> (though it be ſo) but as it is a <hi>work</hi> of God
<hi>upon us,</hi> which he takes care to goe through with, and perfect in
all thoſe who are fruitfull: for he ſpeaks here of it rather as an
<hi>act</hi> of <hi>Gods, He purgeth,</hi> then as it is to be an act of <hi>ours,</hi> that we
ought to purge our ſelves; though both doe goe together, as in
that ſpeech, <hi>Rom. 8. We by the Spirit doe mortifie the deeds of the
fleſh;</hi> ſo as that which is proper to the point in hand, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it, (as here in this place it is laid downe) is not ſo
much to give you motives or meanes of purging your ſelves, as to
<hi>ſhew you the wayes and courſes God takes ſtill one way or other to
purge his children by,</hi> that they may be more fruitfull.</p>
               <p>And yet 3. in this work of Mortification, conſidered thus in
the progreſſe of it, <hi>we are not meer paſſives,</hi> (as at that <hi>finall</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
and finiſhing of it, and carrying away all ſin at <hi>death</hi> we
are, and are at that <hi>firſt</hi> habituall beginning of it, at <hi>converſion)</hi>
but therein we are <hi>workers together with God:</hi> (We being purged
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56064:35"/>
from ſinne, as the body is by phyſick from humours; though the
phyſick work, yet nature joynes with the phyſick, being quickned
and helped by it, to caſt out the humours: For give a dead man
phyſick, and it carryes not any humours away:) So as thoſe
<hi>meanes</hi> whereby God purgeth us, are not to be imagined to
doe it as meer <hi>phyſicall</hi> agents, like as the pruning hook cuts
off branches from a tree, or as when a Surgeon cuts out dead
fleſh; but theſe meanes doe it by ſtirring up our graces, and
quickning them, and by ſetting our thoughts, and faith, and
affections awork, and ſo God aſſiſting with the power of Chriſts
death, he doth purge us daily, by making his word, afflictions,
and the like, to ſet our thoughts awork againſt ſinne, and ſo
to caſt it forth. It is certaine, that unleſſe our <hi>thoughts work</hi> upon
the meanes, as well as the <hi>meanes work</hi> upon us, and ſo doe
mingle themſelves with thoſe meanes; that unleſſe faith and
Chriſts death be mingled in the heart, it purgeth not: And
therefore it is ſaid as well <hi>that we purge our ſelves.</hi> So 2 <hi>Tim.
2. 20.</hi> and alſo 1 <hi>John 3. 3.</hi> and <hi>Rom. 8.</hi> that <hi>we by the Spirit mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the deeds of the fleſh,</hi> as it is ſaid that <hi>God purgeth us,</hi> (which
is the thing affirmed here) becauſe God ſtill in going on to purge
us, doth it by ſtirring up our graces, and uſeth therein acts of our
faith, and love, and many motives and conſiderations to ſtir up
our graces ſo to effect it.</p>
               <p>Now 2. for the reaſons that move God thus to goe on to
purge corruptions out of his children.<note place="margin">Reaſons.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed an eternall divorce
betweene corruption and our hearts: He hath bought off all
our corruptions, and redeemed us from all iniquitie. <hi>Titus 2. 14.
He gave himſelfe for us, that he might redeeme us from all iniquitie,
and purifie unto himſelfe a peculiar people,</hi> and God will have the
price of Chriſts bloud <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> becauſe God deſires more and more to have delight
in us, and to draw nigh to us, and therefore he more and more
goes on to purge us; For though he loves us at firſt, when full
of corruptions, yet he cannot ſo much delight in us as he
would, nor have that communion with us, no more then a
Husband can with a wife, who hath an unſavoury breath, or a
loathſome diſeaſe. They muſt therefore be purified for his bed, as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56064:35"/>
                  <hi>Heſter</hi> was for <hi>Ahaſuerus. Draw nigh to God,</hi> ſayes <hi>James, and I
will draw nigh to you, James 4. 8, 9.</hi> but then you muſt <hi>Cleanſe
your hands, and purifie your hearts,</hi> as it follows there; God elſe

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> he daily purgeth his that they may be fit for uſe and

honourable imployments, ſuch as to ſuffer or to ſtand for him,
in what concernes his glory, they would be unfit for ſuch uſes,
as a veſſel is that is unſcoured. Therefore 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 21. If a man
purge himſelfe from theſe,</hi> he ſhall be a <hi>veſſell unto honour:</hi> that is,
he ſhall be uſed in honourable employments, and not laid aſide;
and he ſhall be <hi>meet for his maſters uſe,</hi> as veſſells kept cleane;
when on the ſudden the maſter hath occaſion to uſe them, and to
have them ſerved in.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> that as our perſons, ſo that our <hi>ſervices</hi> may be
more and more acceptable; that our prayers and ſuch perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
may ſavour leſſe of gifts, and pride, and ſelfe-love, and
carnall deſires: So <hi>Mal. 3. 3, 4.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall ſit as a purifier
of ſilver, and he ſhall purifie the ſonnes of Levi, as gold is purified,
from their droſſe, that they may offer to the Lord an offering in
righteouſneſſe, and then ſhall their offerings be pleaſant to the Lord.</hi>
The more the heart and life is purged, the more acceptable your
prayers are, and your obedience, and all you doe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, by caſting them into afflictions. So <hi>Dan. 11. 35. They
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56064:36"/>

doth not purge out, nor mercies, that afflictions muſt. <hi>Theſe

humours that lie in the skin by ſweating, but winter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocteth
the inward by driving in the heart, and ſo purgeth away
the humours that lye in the inward parts, and ſo what by the one,
what by the other, the body is kept in health. Thus mercies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
againſt ſome ſins, and afflictions againſt others. <hi>Moſes</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to circumciſe his child, (as we doe our hearts, it is ſuch a

               <p>As theſe <hi>occaſionall,</hi>

<hi>Now ye are cleane through the words I have [ſpoken unto you:]</hi> they

The Word at once diſcovers the ſin, and ſets the hearts

goes a light with it to ſee ſin after another manner, although a
man did know it afore, and then the Word ſets out the vileneſſe
of a ſinne; and to heare a ſinne declaimed againſt, and reproved,
ſets an exaſperation upon the mind againſt it, and ſo a man goes
home, and ſets upon it to kill it and deſtroy it. Or elſe by the
<hi>Word meditated</hi> upon, as by keeping ſome truth or other freſh
and ſweet in the mind, which the mind cheweth on; God faſtens
the mind upon ſome new promiſe, or new diſcovered ſigne of a

Attribute of his, and that quickens the inward man, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

God doth make familiar to a mans ſpirit, to <hi>talk with</hi> him, (as
the phraſe is <hi>Pro. 6.)</hi> and to keep him company, and uſually
ſome new one; God leading us through varieties of ſweet truths
to chew upon, <hi>one</hi> this day, and <hi>another</hi> to morrow, and theſe
have an exceeding purging vertue in them, they keep the purging

the Apoſtle, when he heard of <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> their

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>9. Let every one,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>that calls upon the name

<hi>If you [purge your ſelves] from theſe, ye ſhall be veſſels of

               <p>Examples of <hi>holy men:</hi> To heare very holy men ſpeak what

to purge himſelfe, who elſe would content himſelfe with a
leſſer degree: So <hi>Phil. 3. 17.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the laſt place,<note place="margin">4. Inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings.</note> there are many <hi>inward workings</hi> upon the
heart, whereby God goes on ſtill to purge us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by a <hi>further diſcovering of corruptions</hi> unto us; either a
greater filthineſſe in the evils we ſaw afore, or to ſee more of
them, and by what one ſees to ſuſpect more. God never diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
luſts to his, but to carry them away; he <hi>ſtirs</hi> the humours,
to <hi>purge</hi> them: Thus when <hi>David</hi> ſaw his ſinne, he ſets anew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cleanſing himſelfe in the 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> comming new from taking
a view of his heart, and having ſeen ſuch volumes of corruptions,
ſo many Errataes in all that he did, he cryes out, <hi>Who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
his errors?</hi> and withall, <hi>Oh cleanſe me from ſecret ſinnes.</hi> He
then ſaw ſecret evils, and ſuſpected more then as yet he ſaw;
and this made him cry out, <hi>Oh cleanſe me,</hi> and ſo to uſe all means,
and to goe to God to cleanſe him. So when in the 15. <hi>Pſal.</hi>
God let downe a light to let him but ſee the corruption of his
nature afreſh, <hi>that he was borne in ſinne,</hi> and had <hi>no truth</hi> there,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56064:37"/>
more falſhood then he could ever have imagined, <hi>Oh purge me,</hi>
ſayes he upon it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſets the heart on work to make it a buſineſſe to
get ones luſts mortified more and more, and not to reſt in the
meaſure attained. <hi>Phil. 3. 1. Paul forgot what was behind,</hi> he did
ſtill deſire to have more fellowſhig with Chriſt in his death and
ſufferings, in the death of ſinne; when a mans heart is ſet upon
the worke, as that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he came into the world for, as
<hi>David,</hi> who took up a reſolution, <hi>I ſaid I would look to may wayes;</hi>
ſo when a man hath ſaid unto himſelfe, I will grow in grace, as
they ſay, <hi>I will be rich, 2 Tim. 6.</hi> and ſo looks at it as his buſineſſe,
being as much convinced of this, that he ſhould be more holy,
as he was at firſt that he was to be new borne; when growth of
grace is as much in a mans eye, as getting grace at firſt was, and
as great a neceſſity made of the one as of the other. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
many want, and ſo take no care to grow more holy and
more pure. <hi>Phil. 3. 15. If any be otherwiſe minded,</hi> (ſayes the
Apoſtle) that there is no ſuch abſolute neceſſity of going on ſtill
to perfection, <hi>God ſhall reveale it to him.</hi> God doth reveale and
ſet on this upon every godly mans heart at one time or another,
and ſo goes on to purge them. And this is alſo expreſſed to us,
1 <hi>Pet. 4. 1. For as much as Chriſt hath ſuffered for us in the fleſh,
[let us arme] our ſelves with the ſame mind;</hi> namely, to mortifie
our luſts: for it follows, <hi>He that hath ſuffered in the fleſh,</hi> that is,
hath mortified his luſts, <hi>hath ceaſed from ſinne.</hi> That ſame <hi>arming</hi>
there, is Gods putting into the mind a ſtrong and invincible reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to go through with this worke; when he armes and ſteeles
it againſt all difficulties, all encounters. This is meant by <hi>arming
us with the ſame mind;</hi> That as Chriſt looked upon it as his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
why he came into the world, even to ſuffer for us; ſo for
us to look upon it as our buſineſſe, to crucifie our luſts. When
therefore we intend all our indeavours upon this worke, and
mind nothing in compariſon, pray for nothing more, receive
Sacraments for this purpoſe, and heare and performe all other
duties with an eye to this, proſecute this buſineſſe as the main;
when God hath put ſuch a reſolution into a man, and preſerves
it, then he goes on to purge him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God doth it by drawing the ſap and juice of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56064:37"/>
affections of the heart more and more into holy duties, and into
obedience; when that intention of mind, as our morning
thoughts, and the like, which we formerly ſpent upon vanities,
are now drawn into prayer and holy meditations, then luſts doe
wither; and when our care is how to pleaſe God more, and our
hearts are more in the duties of obedience, then doth corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhale off more and more; and thus by diverting our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
doth God worke out corruptions. And looke, as the Sun
doth draw up the ſap out of the root, ſo doth Chriſt draw out
the heart at ſome times more then at others to holy duties, and
unto communion with himſelfe in the duties: this killeth ſin, and
cauſeth it to wither, namely, by taking away the ſap, that is, that
<hi>intention</hi> of mind which doth uſually nouriſh it: Thus 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 22.
We purifie our hearts by obeying the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, by bringing the heart more and more acquainted
with Chriſt his Sonne: (which is the Fathers work to doe, for
<hi>none comes to the Son, but whom the Father draws)</hi> Now how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſoules are there, who have gone puddring on (as I may ſo
ſpeak) in the uſe of other meanes, and though in the uſe thereof
Chriſt hath communicated ſome vertue to them, yet becauſe
they did not trade with him chiefly in thoſe duties, they have
had little in compariſon to what afterwards they have had,
when he hath been diſcovered to them, as that great ordinance
who is appointed by God to get their luſts mortified. Afore
this they have waſht, and waſht, but they have waſht without
ſope, untill Chriſt hath been thus revealed to them, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his death, and riſing againe, which is compared, <hi>Mal. 3.</hi>
unto <hi>Fullers ſope,</hi> &amp;c. In the 13. <hi>Zach. 1.</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>God opens
a fountaine to the houſe of David, for ſinne and for uncleanneſſe:</hi>
that is, for the guilt of ſinne, and the power of ſinne. Now by
that <hi>opening</hi> is not meant the promiſe of ſending his Sonne into
the world to be crucified, but the diſcovery of him to beleevers
after his being crucified: For <hi>Chap. 12. 10.</hi> he is ſuppoſed to be
crucified already, for they there <hi>ſee him whom they have pierced;</hi>
therefore that <hi>opening</hi> there is meant the diſcovery of him to his
people, and him to be the great ordinance of cleanſing them.
Now the more diſtinctly a man underſtands Chriſt, and how to
make uſe of him, (who is already made <hi>Sanctification to us)</hi> the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56064:38"/>
more eaſily he gets his luſts purged; ſuch an one that trades im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
with Chriſt, will doe more in a day, then another in a
yeare; for ſeeing that the power of purging us lies immediately
in him; and that he is the purging drug which mingles it ſelfe
with the Word, and all meanes elſe, and ſets them all aworke:
therefore the more of him we have, and the more immediate
application we have of him to us, and of his power, the more
recourſe our hearts have to him, the more our luſts are purged;
as it is in drugs or minerals, if the infuſion and ſteeping of them
in liquors will worke; how much more if the ſubſtance of them
be taken downe inwardly and immediately? now this comes to
paſſe, as God doth goe on to open <hi>our faith to ſee him,</hi> and know
him, and to be acquainted with him: for ſo the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
it, <hi>Phil. 3. That I may know him, and the power of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi>
The more we look upon all means elſe in the uſe of
them as ineffectuall without him, the more power we ſhall find
from him.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, by aſſuring the ſoule of his love, and ſhedding it abroad
in the heart, and by working ſpirituall joy in the heart, doth God
alſo purge his people: And to work all theſe is in Gods power
immediately and ſolely; <hi>I am Crucified with Chriſt, Gal. 2. 20.</hi>
And how? by beleeving that <hi>Chriſt gave himſelfe for me, and
loved me.</hi> This deads a man to the world, makes a man crucifie
that which Chriſt was crucified for, and this makes a man hate
ſinne, the more he loves Chriſt, or apprehends his love; And it
doth this in a double relation or reſpect, not onely becauſe ſin ſo
diſpleaſeth him, nor onely as it is contrary to his will, but becauſe
it did afflict him ſo much once, and becauſe to <hi>take ſinne away</hi>
was the intent he came into the world: for ſo 1 <hi>John 3. ver. 4.</hi>
although a beleever is ſaid to mortifie ſinne upon this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
indeed, that it is <hi>the tranſgreſſion of the Law;</hi> yet much
more upon this other, becauſe <hi>Chriſt was manifeſt to take ſinnes
away:</hi> and the more aſſurance I have of another life and a better,
and of being like Chriſt hereafter, the more a man purgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be fit for that condition: <hi>He that hath this hope in him,
purgeth himſelfe as he is pure;</hi> ſo in the 2. <hi>ver.</hi> of that 3. of <hi>John.</hi>
The more joy a man hath in Chriſt, the more deaded he muſt
needs be to the world; the one eats up the other: for the ground
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56064:38"/>
of all ſinne is but the love of pleaſure; now if I find it in God,
and Chriſt, it deads me for ſeeking it in the world: For <hi>Omnis
vita guſtu ducitur,</hi> All life is maintained by a taſte of ſome ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Now when the ſweetneſſe of ſin, the reliſh of it is ſpoiled
by the taſte of a greater, it muſt needs die and abate; and though
that ſweetneſſe from God doth not alwayes remaine in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
taſte and reliſh of it, yet it leaves ſuch an impreſſion behind
it, that whatever a man taſts after, it hath no reliſh with him, in
compariſon; ſtill he ſayes <hi>the old is better:</hi> and though the taſte
of one ſinfull pleaſure may take us off from another, yet none
but a contrary pleaſure doth kill the ſinne, and the pleaſure
in it.</p>

               <p>I Will now come to that third thing which was propounded,
namely, <hi>Helps</hi> whereby you may diſcerne what progreſſe hath
been made in this work: And as I ſaid at firſt, that my purpoſe

               <p>And firſt, I will handle it negatively, and give you ſuch ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes,
as argue much corruption, a great deale of humours yet
remaining to be purged out: Such as argue little proficiency in
this worke, though ſuch as withall true grace may be ſuppoſed to
be in the heart.</p>
               <p>1. When a man doth magnifie, and ſets a high price upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
worldly and carnall excellencies and pleaſures; is much taken
with outward things, and carryed away with them: Or when
(though we reſtrain our ſelves from the eager purſuit after them,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56064:39"/>
yet if) in your eyes and opinions they ſeeme glorious and goodly
things, and oh we ſecretly think the enjoying ſuch a pleaſure,
the obtaining ſuch an excellencie, or ſuch or ſuch a condition of
life, accommodated with ſuch and ſuch conveniences and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
would be ſo great an addition of happineſſe to us; this
argues a green heart, much want of mortification, though truth
of grace be there. Theſe Apoſtles, to whom Chriſt ſpake this
Parable of the Vine, (and unto them eſpecially) how were they
affected, and tranſported with a trifle? Even that very night
that Chriſt was to be attached, they ſtrive for precedencie, and
who ſhould be <hi>the greateſt amongst them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Luk. 22.</hi> who ſhould be
chiefe of that noble order: And it was ſuch a precedencie which
they affected, as Noblemen have in Kingdomes, as appears by
the following words: they ſhewed themſelves but <hi>Gentiles</hi> in it,
(as <hi>ver. 25.</hi> Chriſt inſinuates) who ſtand upon their blood and
their outward priviledges: It was not for nothing Chriſt tels
them in this Parable, they needed purging; but the reaſon was,
they were but children yet, and <hi>babes in Chriſt,</hi> now in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority,
and were not weaned from rattles and trifles, Chriſt was
not yet crucified, not they ſo throughly crucified with him, as
they were afterwards: The holy Ghoſt had not yet come upon
them, as fire to burne up their luſts, and to conſume this their
droſſe. That other Apoſtle, <hi>Paul,</hi> (who ſayes of himſelfe, that
he was <hi>borne out of time,</hi> in compariſon to them) had attained to
a greater meaſure, he glorying in this as his higheſt title, that he
was <hi>the leaſt of the Apoſtles.</hi> This magnifying of outward things
in our conceits and opinions, is indeed but <hi>knowing things after
the fleſh,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 16.</hi> becauſe the fleſh doth
faſcinate and corrupt the judgment, in judging our ſelves by ſuch
things. And this argues exceeding much want of mortification,
for it is luſt that puts that luſtre, and gloſſe, and varniſh upon the
things of the world; for the things in themſelves are vaine, and
we have had experience that they are ſuch; How comes it then
we ſhould eſteeme them, and be taken with them, that we ſhould
have ſuch high conceits of them? It is by reaſon of our luſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purged
out, which repreſent them falſely: and therefore it is
obſervable, that <hi>John, 1 Epiſt. 2. 16.</hi> ſpeaking of the things of
the world, he puts <hi>the luſt</hi> which is in us to expreſſe the <hi>things</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:56064:39"/>
themſelves: He ſayes not, riches, and preferment, &amp;c. (though
he ſpeaks of them) but the <hi>luſts of the eye,</hi> and <hi>pride of life,</hi> (ſo
he expreſſeth them) becauſe they are theſe luſts, makes the things
ſo glorious to us, and ſets a price upon them. And therefore ſo
much magnifying and high eſteeme of outward things as there is
in us, ſo much inordinate luſt there is in the heart after them, and
ſo much want of mortification; and when theſe luſts boiling in
us fume up ſo high as to intoxicate and corrupt our <hi>eſteeme</hi> and
<hi>judgments</hi> (which though grace ſhould keep us from purſuing
theſe vanities) that yet we look upon them with a wanton eye,
and thinke great matters in them, and think our ſelves as it were
debarred and reſtrained of ſo much of our happineſſe, whilſt we
want, and cannot enjoy them, this argues an unmortifyedneſſe:
for herein lies the power of mortification, even to <hi>count all things
droſſe and dung,</hi> to looke upon them as <hi>crucified things,</hi> to have
them ſeeme all as withered flowers, as <hi>ſmall things,</hi> as he ſpeaks
of <hi>mans</hi> eſteeme, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 3.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, when our minds are carried out to ſuperfluities, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
more then needs, and are diſcontented with our own condition,
though it be ſuch as might content us, this argues a great want of
purging, this is from ſuperfluity, of humours abounding in the
heart. When they in the wilderneſſe, though they had Manna,
yet they muſt have Quails alſo; when there are ſuch extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
affections in us, that we thinke any other condition would
pleaſe us better then our owne, this argues much unmortifyed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
though it run not out into acts; it is the <hi>ſuperfluity of
naughtineſſe,</hi> the exceſſe of corruption that thinks <hi>ſtolne meate
ſweet,</hi> as in the <hi>Proverbs.</hi> When our longings are wild and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous,
like the longings of women with child, whom nothing
but ſome one odde thing they have ſet their fancie on, will
pleaſe; like ſick mens ſtomachs, with whom nothing will down
that is provided for them, but ſtill they have a mind rather to
ſomething elſe; ſo nor we with what God allots us. And when
we are environed about with comforts, yet all are nothing, if
ſome one be wanting. Such unmortifyed luſts we ſee in <hi>Sampſon,</hi>
though a good man, yet none of the daughters of Iſrael could

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, when our minds are ſo glued to any thing, as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:56064:40"/>
tell how to part with it, how to loſe ſuch a friend, or ſuch a
conveniencie, we would think our ſelves halfe undone if ſuch
or ſuch a thing ſhould fall out; <hi>Davids</hi> heart was full of humours,
and needed purging, when he ventured ſo much of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in his <hi>Abſalom</hi> alone, that when he was caſt away, he wiſht
he had dyed for him. It is good often to try our hearrs, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the worſt that can befall us. What if a change ſhould
come, ſuch a thing I ſhould be put to; to ſee how the heart can
beare it. When ſome men have a loſſe in their eſtates and riches,
it is as it were <hi>raked</hi> out of their bellies, as <hi>Zophar</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job 20.
15.</hi> and a piece even of their very heart goes with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, when a man is ſtill diſtempered under variety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and buſineſſes, and is inordinate in them all, it argues
much unmortifiedneſſe: As if he be to recreate himſelfe, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
in it, and knows not when to end, and fall to his calling
againe; if to ſtudy, then he is alſo as violent in it, and entrenches
upon the duties ſhould keep up his ſoule in health, as alſo upon
the neceſſary refreſhings his body requires. Broach the veſſell
where you will, if ſtill it runs muddy and thick, it is a ſigne
the veſſell is full of ill liquor. To be diſtempered in ſome one
particular is leſſe, but when in every vein that is opened, much
corrupt bloud comes forth, it is a ſigne the body is full of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and needs purging. A man that is in an ague, and
when the cold fit takes him, he is extreme cold, and when
the hot fit comes, he is on the contrary as extreame hot, it is
a ſigne he is full of humours, which as they are purged out, one
or the other abates, or both; if when a man abounds, then he is
commonly confident, and forgets God; if when he wants,
then he is as much on the other ſide diſtempered, and grows
ſolicitous, diſtruſtfull. Sound bodies can beare ſudden altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of heat and cold, but diſtempered weak bodies cannot.
Nature cannot beare a ſudden alteration, but much Grace can;
<hi>I know how to want, I know how to abound, Phil. 4. 12.</hi> He was
much therefore mortified; he could work hard in Summer,
without much ſweating, and he could undergoe the cold of
Winter without catarrhs and ſuch weakneſſes as others are
ſubject to; his ſoule was well purged of humours. And ſo <hi>Job</hi> had
learnt to bleſſe God when all was gone; he was a man throughly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56064:40"/>
mortifyed before, he had carryed himſelfe in his beſt eſtate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſecurity and carnall rejoycing; thus he ſayes of himſelfe that
he <hi>made not gold his hope, nor his confidence, nor had rejoyced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his wealth was great, Job 31. 25.</hi> and anſwerably he behaves
himſelfe in his worſt eſtate with patience and thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the more carnall confidence we have in the creatures,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
and beare our ſelves upon them, and have our ſpirits ſtrengthned
and upholden by them, the more want of mortification. The
Corinthians, though godly, yet they were very unmortifyed,
therefore the Apoſtle ſayes, they were <hi>rather carnall then ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
1 Cor. 3. 1.</hi> Now this their carnall mindedneſſe, among
other things, was expreſſed in their carnall confidence they had
in outward things; they had riches, and gifts, and learning, and
they did ſwim in theſe; and reigned and domineered in their
owne thoughts, and excelled all other Churches in their owne
opinions and ſo deſpiſed others in compariſon, they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
aloft by theſe waxen wings, which I take to be the Apoſtles
meaning, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 8. Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have
reigned:</hi> they had riches, and gifts, &amp;c. and they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as Kings, full of happineſſe, having the world afore them,
and were filled with conceits of it; and <hi>I wuold to God you did
reigne,</hi> ſayes he: that is, that it were not <hi>regnum in capite,</hi> in
your owne conceits onely; and that there were indeed ſuch
reall cauſe to applaud your own conditions. <hi>We are of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi>
ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>and have no confidence in the fleſh, Phil. 1. 3.</hi>
The more the heart is truly circumciſed, (of which he there
ſpeakes in oppoſition to thoſe who reſted in outward circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
it truſteth not, nor beareth not it ſelfe upon outward
things, priviledges and endowments, as riches, bloud, credit,
learning, righteouſneſſe; theſe, when the heart is not circumciſed,
doe puffe it up, <hi>but we,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>have no confidence in the fleſh,</hi>
either for comfort, or for juſtification, or any thing elſe; <hi>but we
rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, the more full of envyings, and heart-burnings againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
others, and of breakings forth into ſtrife our hearts are, and of
ſtrivings and contentions to get the credit, or riches, or victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from others, &amp;c. the more unmortified are our hearts, &amp; the
more need of purging. Theſe overflowings of the gall and ſpleen,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56064:41"/>
come from a fulneſſe of bad humours. <hi>Whereas there is among
you envying and ſtrife, are ye not carnall? 1 Cor. 3. 3.</hi> That is,
this argues you to be ſuch, for envie and ſtrife are not onely luſts
in themſelves, but further they are ſuch luſts, as are always the
children and fruit of ſome other; they are rooted in, and ſpring
from inordinate affections to ſome things which we contend
for; and accordingly if this fire of envie or ſtrife prove great,
it argues the fuell, that is, the luſts after the things we envie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for, to be much more: For envie is but an oblique luſt,
founded on ſome more direct luſt: theſe are but the outward
fluſhings, that ſhew the diſtemper to be much more within:
<hi>Jam. 4. 1. From whence comes wars and fightings amongst you?
come they not hence, even of your luſts which fight in your members?</hi>
There is ſomething the heart would have, as it follows in the
<hi>2. ver. Ye luſt and have not, &amp;c.</hi> A contentious ſpirit is an unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed
ſpirit; <hi>If ye bite and devour one another, Gal. 5. 15. This I
ſay then, walk in the ſpirit, and ye ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh.</hi>
Mark the coherence, it comes in upon biting one at another, for
ſuch walke not in the ſpirit, fleſh doth prevaile in them, that is his
meaning.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, the leſſe able we are to heare reproofs for the
breakings forth of our luſts, the more unmortifyed it argues our
hearts to be: it is a ſigne we love thoſe much, whom we cannot
endure to heare ſpoken againſt: therefore ſayes the Apoſtle,
<hi>Be ſwift to heare, but ſlow to wrath;</hi> take heed of raging when you
are toucht; And it follows a verſe after, <hi>Caſting away all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity,
receive the word with meekneſſe,</hi> for it is your luſts uncaſt
out, unpurged, that cauſe that wrath and heart-boiling againſt
reproofe. That good King was in a great diſtemper of ſpirit,
when he caſt the Prophet in priſon that reproved him, for <hi>he
oppreſſed the people alſo at the ſame time,</hi> as is ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron. 16. 10.</hi>
he was then taken in the ſpring-tide, and ſwelling of his luſts of
covetouſneſſe and oppreſſion; they brake downe all that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
and oppoſed the current of them: and if (as he in this fit
at this time, ſo) we be found in ſuch paſſionate tempers upon
ſuch occaſions of reproof ordinarily, it argues the habituall frame
of our hearts to be much unmortifyed, as this argued him at this
time to have beene actually much diſtempered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:56064:41"/>
Eighthly, the more quick and ſpeedy the temptation is in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
taking, the more unmortified the heart is: When an object at
the firſt preſenting makes the luſt to riſe, and paſſeth through at
the very firſt preſenting of it, and ſoaks into the heart, as oile into
the bones, and runs through all; when a man is gunpowder to
temptations, and it is but <hi>touch</hi> and <hi>take,</hi> ſo as there needes not
much blowing, but the heart is preſently on fire, as <hi>Prov. 7. 22.</hi>
it is ſaid, <hi>He went [ſtraight-way] after her.</hi> A man will find that
when his heart is actually in a good temper, a temptation doth
not ſo eaſily take: his heart is then, though tinder, yet as wet tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that is more ſlow in taking. As there is a <hi>preparedneſſe to
good works,</hi> ſo there is a preparedneſſe to evill; when the heart is
in a covetous humour, <hi>and will be rich, then a man falls into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and a ſnare, 1 Tim. 6.</hi> His luſts will nibble at every bait in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing he deales in; they will take preſently: when the heart
is thus bird-limed, then it cleaves to every thing it meets with.
It is a ſigne that the heart is not <hi>awake to righteouſneſſe</hi> as the
Apoſtle ſpeaks, but to ſin rather, when a little occaſion awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
a luſt, and rouzeth it; as when on the contrary, if a great
deale of jogging will not awaken a mans grace.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, the more our luſts have power to diſturb us in holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
duties, and the more they prevaile with the heart then, the more
unmortified and profane the heart is; as to have uncleane glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in hearing, and worldly thoughts then ordinarily to poſſeſſe
the heart, and to take it up much; <hi>They are prophane</hi> (ſayes God,
<hi>Jer. 23. 11.) for in my houſe I have found their wickedneſſe.</hi> If the
heart be carryed away, and overcome with uncleane and worldly
thoughts then, this argues much unmortifyedneſſe, and that the
fleſh is indeed much above the ſpirit: For why, then a man is in
Gods preſence, and that ſhould overcome and over-awe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
part, if it were not impudent and outragious; and
beſides, then the regenerate part hath the advantage, for the
Word and the Ordinance is a ſtirring of it up, and provoking it
to holyneſſe: And therefore that at ſuch a time a mans luſts
ſhould be able to tempt and ſeduce a mans heart, it argues ſinne
hath a great part in the heart, when it affronts God in his throne,
when grace is <hi>in Solio,</hi> where it would be; for the Diſciples
then to be talking who ſhould be greateſt, when Chriſt had made
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56064:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo long a Sermon to them, and had adminiſtred the Sacrament
to them, this argued much want of mortification in them; even
as it were a ſigne that the orthodox party were but a weak party
in a Kingdome, if whilſt they are at Sermons, Papiſts durſt come
in and diſturb them, and put them out.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Tenthly, when the recalling former acts committed by a man,
prove ſtill to be a ſnare to him; and being ſuggeſted by Satan
as a means to quicken his luſt, the thought thereof doth rather
ſtir up his luſt afreſh, it is a ſigne of an unmortifyed frame. Thus
is it laid to the charge of that Nation, <hi>Ezech. 23. 21. That ſhe
multiplyed her whoredomes in calling to remembrance the dayes of her
youth, wherein ſhe had played the harlot in the land of Egypt:</hi> The
remembrance of them was a ſnare to her, as appeares by the
8. verſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>. It is a ſigne a man is deeply in love, when as he falls in
love with the picture; when the <hi>remembrance</hi> of whence he is
falne, ſhould <hi>make him repent,</hi> that it ſhould on the contrary
cauſe him to commit the ſame ſinne againe, it is a ſigne fleſh hath
much the better. To have the mind ſtirred with new objects and
new temptations, may ſtand with far leſſe corruption, and more
grace, then to have it ſtirred afreſh with the remembrance of the
old; to find ſweetneſſe in a luſt twice ſod, which we have alſo
often ſteept (as I may ſo ſpeak) in godly ſorrow and hatred of it,
and ſo boiled it in ſowre hearbs; yet ſtill to find ſweetneſſe in
the remembrance of ſuch an act, this argues much corruption.
As the Apoſtle argues the ſinfulneſſe and ſtrength of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in him, that <hi>the law which was holy and good,</hi> ſhould ſtir up
his luſt whilſt unregenerate: So may we, when the thought of
a ſin which ſhould ſtir up godly ſorrow, ſhould provoke and
tickle corrupt nature againe. Indeed that the new ſcent of meat
ſhould have moved the Iſraelites, would not have been ſo much;
but that the <hi>remembrance</hi> of their fleſh-pots ſhould doe it. That
ſpeech <hi>Rom. 8.</hi> where we are commanded to <hi>mortifie the deeds of
the fleſh,</hi> may admit among other this interpretation alſo, that
not onely the luſts, but even former deeds and acts committed,
which may prove an occaſion of ſin to us, and have a freſh ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
in our eye, are to be mortifyed.</p>

               <p>AND ſo now I come to the ſecond ſort of ſignes, namely,
<hi>Poſitive ſignes</hi> of growth in Mortification, and of Gods
purging of us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the more inſight a man hath into ſpirituall corruptions,
together with a conflict againſt them, the more growth he hath
attained unto in purging out corruptions: So as that now the
chiefeſt of his conflict is come to be with ſpirituall luſts, not
worldly luſts and groſſe evils; it is an evidence of his progreſſe
in this worke. Theſe ordinarily are ſure rules, that whilſt a mans
conflict is with more outward groſſe evills, as uncleanneſſe,
worldly mindneſſe, &amp;c. ſo long and ſo much he is kept from the
ſight of thoſe inward, hidden, cloſe corruptions, which ſit nigheſt
to the heart: As alſo on the contrary, the more a man is freed
from, and hath got victory over ſuch more outward evills, the
more his thoughts and intentions are bent inward to the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the other more ſpirituall wickedneſſes. And the reaſon is,
for theſe ſpirituall luſts, as pride, carnall confidence in a mans
owne graces, ſelf-flattery, preſumption, and the like, theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
lie (as I may ſo expreſſe it,) more up in the heart of the
countrey; but thoſe other of worldly luſts, lye as it were in the
Frontiers, and skirts of it; and therefore, untill ſuch time as a
man hath in ſome good meaſure overcome thoſe that encounter
him at the Borders, he comes not to have ſo through a diſcovery,
and conſtant conflict with thoſe that lie higher up in the heart;
<hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all pollution both of fleſh and ſpirit,</hi>
ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Cor. 7.</hi> Which implyes, that there are two
ſorts of corruptions, <hi>one of the fleſh,</hi> or body; the other, <hi>of the
ſpirit,</hi> or ſoule: for ſo the oppoſition there is to be taken, for
elſe all luſts are luſts <hi>of the fleſh,</hi> that is, of corrupt nature. Againe,
ſuch corruptions cauſe <hi>a blindneſſe that a man cannot ſee afar off,</hi>
as 2 <hi>Pet. Chap. 1.</hi> Whilſt a ſcholar that learnes a Tongue, hath
not learned to eſcape all groſſer faults in Grammaticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56064:43"/>
he cannot be ſuppoſed to have come to know the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies
of the Tongue, nor ſee his errors therein; ſo nor doe
men come to be <hi>Critiques</hi> indeed, and cunningly skilfull in the
more curious <hi>Errataes</hi> of their hearts and ſpirits, till they have
attained to ſuch a degree of mortification, as to be free from
groſſer evils. And indeed, thoſe who are grown in grace, have
attained ordinarily ſome freedome from ſuch ſinnes; therefore
ſayes <hi>John, 1 Epiſt. 2. 14. You young men are ſtrong, and have
overcome that evill one:</hi> they have attained ſo much ſtrength as
to overcome the groſſer evils, thoſe evills. So as to allude to
what the Apoſtle ſayes in another caſe, they then come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
not ſo much with <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> and outward evils, as with
<hi>ſpirituall wickedneſſes</hi> within, (that is) with affections and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
contrary to the worke of grace, and therein lies their
chiefeſt exerciſe, which is not till they have ſome free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and victory over the other, and ſo are at leaſure to view
theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we may diſcerne our victory over our luſts, by our
ability more or leſſe to deny our ſelves; the more we grow up
to a readineſſe, willingneſſe, and freeneſſe, and cheerfulneſſe of
heart to deny our ſelves when we are called and put upon doing
of it, the more are luſts purged out: for the reaſon that our hearts
conſult ſo much with carnall ends in buſineſſes, that we have ſo
much adoe with them ere we can bring them off to part with
ſuch and ſuch things, as God and our owne conſciences doe call
us unto, is through want of purging: For all want of ſelf-denyall
is from an adhaeſion to outward things. Were we free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married
men to the world, were our hearts looſned from all;
and were all the ſecreat <hi>fibrae,</hi> thoſe ſtings of luſts that ſhoot into
things, cut, it would be nothing to us to part with them: this
was in that great Apoſtle, how ready was he to lay downe his
life? <hi>My life is not deare to me, ſo I may fulfill my miniſtration
with joy;</hi> and ſo when the time of his departure was at hand,
ſayes he, <hi>I am ready to be offered, 2 Tim. 4. 6.</hi> He ſpeaks it in the
preſent tenſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I am offered,</hi> it was done in his heart
already: As in like phraſe of ſpeech it is ſaid, <hi>Heb. 11.</hi> that
<hi>Abraham offered up his ſon,</hi> becauſe in his heart he fully purpoſed
it. When men muſt be forced by terrors of conſcience, as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56064:43"/>
                  <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with plagues, to let their credits or eſtates goe by reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
or for God and good uſes, &amp;c. it is a ſigne of want of
purging. The more looſned a man is from the world, and the
things of it, the more prepared that man is for all works of ſelf-denyall,
and the more purged. So when a man parts with all
without ſticking or higling, as <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid <hi>to beleeve without
ſtaggering,</hi> it is a ſigne he hath attained to a good degree: even
as that argued a ſtrong faith, <hi>Rom. 3.</hi> When a man hath an open
and a large heart to God, (as a liberall man hath an open hand
to men) as <hi>Abraham</hi> had when he was willing to let God have
his onely ſonne, it was a ſigne he was much weaned; when God
can command any thing thou haſt at an hours warning, as we ſay;
<hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood not long deliberating, Shall I, Shall I, but went
<hi>early in the morning,</hi> even the next morning, God having called
for his ſonne that very night, as it is likely by that in the 22.
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. For the night was the time when God uſed to reveale
himſelfe by viſions, and the next morning he went forth
early.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the more conſtancie there is in our hearts and wayes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the more eaven, ſtable in well-doing, and the more laſting, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
frame and temper for holineſſe we find our hearts to abide
in, the more we are purged; for in that we finde ſuch ſudden
flowings and re-flowings in our hearts, that when a corruption
ſeemes to be at a low ebbe, and our hearts in a good frame,
within an houre or ſo a mighty tide comes in, and we find our
hearts overflowne with a ſea of filth, ſuch ſudden alterations
from the better to the worſe, doe come from thoſe vaſt ſeas of
corruptions that are ſtill within us, that tumble and float up and
downe in our hearts: So the Apoſtle intimates, <hi>Purge your hearts,
ye double minded:</hi> That their hearts are of ſo unequall a temper,
ſometimes in hot fits, ſometimes in cold, and ſo ſuddenly altered,
this cannot be but from much corruption. This double minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
comes from want of purging. The <hi>Galatians</hi> were ſurely
very weak, and <hi>fooliſh,</hi> as he tells them, when they were ſo ſoone
tranſported. He marvails not ſo much that they were removed,
as that <hi>ſo ſoone,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo ſuddenly, <hi>Gal. 1. 6.</hi> and brings it in
as an evidence of their weakneſſe, that they who would have <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him their eyes,</hi> ſhould now ſo much be altered and carryed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56064:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
away: So much mortifiedneſſe, ſo much conſtancie: therefore in
the 5. <hi>Gal. 15. 16.</hi> when in the 15. <hi>ver.</hi> he had ſaid, <hi>Thoſe that are
Chriſts have crucified the affections with the lusts,</hi> he addes in the
<hi>16. ver. If we live in the spirit, let us walke in the spirit:</hi> the word
imports a being conſtant in the ſpirit. Then when luſts are cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
then the holy Spirit will rule us in our wayes, and a holy
frame of heart will be diſcovered, in a conſtant tract of holineſſe
we ſhall <hi>walk in the ſpirit,</hi> keep our ſelves long in a ſpirituall frame
and courſe, and not be biaſed aſide: that we ſtep out ſo much, is
from ſtrong luſts unmortified.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the more a man comes to a ſpirituall taſte of the
ſpirituall Word, and that which is moſt ſpirituall therein, the
more it is a ſigne that corruption is purged out: when a man
comes to his ſtomach, it is a ſigne he is growing out of a ſickneſſe,
and that the humours are much purged out. So 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 1. Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſide all malice, &amp;c. as Babes deſire the Word, that ye may grow
thereby, if ſo be ye have taſted:</hi> therefore the more corruption is
laid aſide, the more we taſte the Word, and God in it; the more
we taſte, the more we deſire it; the more we deſire it, the more
we grow.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, when we are aſhamed of former carriages and wayes,
as ſeeing and diſcerning thoſe weakneſſes we ſaw not afore, as
Scholars uſe to be of their exerciſes a yeare or two after; ſo
if we be aſhamed of former prayers, hearings, &amp;c. as that great
Proficient, diſcerned in himſelfe, who looking back upon his
firſt dayes of converſion, ſayes, <hi>When I was a child, I ſpake as a

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, when in ordinary times of temptation a man finds a luſt
not ſo violent and raging as it was wont, but more impotent and
weak. Look to your fits of ſinning whether they become greater
or leſſe, for then a mans ſtrength or weakneſſe is diſcerned moſt;
as the bodily ſtrength is, when a man either goes about to put
himſelf forth, or is aſſaulted and ſet upon. Many that are ſick,
whilſt they lie ſtill in their beds, think they have a great deale of
ſtrength, but when they attempt to riſe, and walk, they ſink
down againe. As a mans weakneſſe to good is diſcerned, when
he comes to doe and to act it, <hi>Rom. 7. To doe I am not able;</hi> ſo a
mans weakneſſe to ſinne, or ſtrength againſt it, is then alſo beſt

<hi>might know what is in his heart;</hi> now if then a man finds that
the motions of ſinne in his heart do every temptation after other
meet with an hotter encounter then they had wont; that the
reſiſtance againſt ſin grows quicker, and ſtronger; that ſinne
cannot advance, and carry on his army ſo far as formerly, but is
ſtill encountred and met withall at the Frontiers, and there
overthrown even at the firſt ſetting out, ſo as it cannot carry it
through the camp, (as <hi>Zimri</hi> did his miſtreſſe <hi>Cosbi)</hi> as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it had wont, when as Grace ſtood at the Tent doore, as
<hi>Moſes</hi> weeping, yet unable to reſiſt it; and although aſſaults and
temptations doe continue, that yet there is ground kept and won
upon the encroachments of a luſt, in ſo much that at leaſt the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
forts are kept by grace, that is, outward acts are abſtained
from; Now ſo far as the luſt is not fulfilled as it had wont to be,
and not onely ſo, but the inrodes of it are confined and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
alſo to a narrower compaſſe, and to have a leſſer ground and
ſpace in regard of inward acts; alſo ſo far it is purged more
forth: As for inſtance, be it a luſt of fancie, when it cannot
boile up to ſuch groſſe fancies as it had wont; be it a luſt of pride,
or uncleanneſſe, or groſſer acts, when it falls from bringing forth
fruit, to bring forth but bloſſomes, but inward burnings, and
from bloſſomes onely to bring forth leaves, it is a ſigne then it
is withering more and more. When the intention of mind in
the temptation (which is as the fire that makes it to boile) grows
leſſe and leſſe; when the inordinate thirſt is not ſo great in the
time of the fit; when the inward acts are grown in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
more modeſt, the luſtings themſelves pitch upon lower and
inferiour acts then it had wont; when their Armies depart with
leſſer ſpoile, are content with them, when as before they flew at
the firſt on-ſet, to the higheſt kinds of villanies and out-rages;
when thus the overflowings of a mans luſts doe abate, and fall
ſhort, the tides leſſen, over-flow leſſe ground, over-ſpread leſſe
every day then another, this is another probable ſigne of a growth

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighthly, when our hearts doe not linger after ſuch objects as
may ſatisfie our luſts, when abſent; but when out of ſight, they
are out of mind, this is a good degree of mortification. We may
find it in our ſelves, that when objects are not preſented, that
yet there is in our hearts oftentimes a lingring after them, and
this from themſelves without any outward provocation that is
far worſe; many a man, when he ſees meat, finds he hath a
ſtomach to it, which he thought not till it was ſet afore him;
but when a man longs after meat he ſees not, it is a ſigne he is
very hungry; as we ſee againſt rainy weather, before the raine
begins to fall, the ſtones will <hi>give,</hi> as we uſe to ſay, and grow
danke; ſo a man that obſerves his heart, may find before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are preſented, or actuall thoughts ariſe, a giving of his heart
to ſuch and ſuch a luſt, an inclination, a darkneſſe, a moiſtneſſe,
a ſympathizing with ſuch an object, that is a ſigne of unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiedneſſe.

it may be at firſt cryes after the dug, though he ſees it not;
but afterwards, though it may be when he ſees it he cryes after
it, yet not when abſent. Objects preſent have a far greater force
to draw, when abſent leſſe; therefore this is a farther degree of
mortification attainable: it was in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when his Miſtreſſe
tempted him from day to day, opportunity was ready, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
preſent, but he denyed her. So in <hi>Boaz,</hi> a woman lay at his

When Phyſitians would judge of a conſumption of the whole,
they doe it not by the falling away of any part what ever, as of
the fleſh in the face alone, or any the like; ſuch a particular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement
of fleſh in ſome one part, may come from ſome other
cauſe; but they uſe to judge by the falling away of the brawne
of the hands, or armes, and thighes, &amp;c. for theſe are the more
ſolid parts: the like judgments doe Phyſitians make upon other
diſeaſes, and of the abatement of them from the decreaſe in ſuch
ſymptomes as are Pathognomicall, and proper and peculiar to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56064:46"/>
them: In like manner alſo the eſtimate of the progreſſe of the
victories of a Conquerour in an enemies Kingdome, is not taken
from the taking or burning of a few villages or dorps, but by
taking in the Forts and ſtrongeſt Holds, and by what ground he
hath won upon the chiefe ſtrength, and by what forces he hath

                     </gap>raordinary aſſiſtances or temptations.</note> you muſt not judge of your Mortification, by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
aſſiſtances or temptations: As you doe not judge of
the ſtrength of a Kingdome by auxiliary forraigne forces, that are
at extraordinary times called in. A young Chriſtian ſhall for
his encouragement even in the heat of the battaile, when he is
ready to be overcome, and carryed away captive, find the holy
Ghoſt breaking in, and reſcuing of him, (as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> was, (to
allude to it) when <hi>he cryed to the Lord)</hi> when as a Chriſtian of
much ſtanding is left to fight it out hand to hand: Now it doth
not follow that the other, becauſe thus freed, hath the more
ſtrength. Againe, on the other ſide, a man is not to judge of
himſelfe by his weakneſſe in ſome one extraordinary temptation.
A man that is very ſick, and nigh unto death and diſſolution,
may through much heat, and ſtirring up of all his ſpirits, have the
ſtrength of five men in him, and much greater then when he was
in health: And ſo a godly man, whoſe corruptions are weak,
and more neere to diſſolution, yet in a fit may have all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
that is within him muſtered up, and blowne up by Satan,
and ſo it may for the preſent appeare to have more ſtrength
then ever in all his life, and yet he may be much mortified: Even
as <hi>Sarah</hi> may by an extraordinary means have pleaſure in her old
age, and bring forth a child, when ſhe had left child-bearing long,
and yet her <hi>womb was dead, Rom. 4. 19.</hi> And as it may be true,
that one of ſmall grace may have that little grace drawne out, and
wound up to a higher ſtraine, for one fit, brunt and exerciſe; all
the ſtrings wound up to a higher note for ſome one leſſon, then
one haply of more grace ever felt, to higher acts of love to God,
and of rejoycing in God, and purer ſtrains of ſelfe-denyall; yet
take the conſtant ſtrains of ones ſpirit that hath more grace, and
the ſtrings will ordinarily endure to ſtand higher, and continue
ſo: So on the contrary, one of much mortification, may have
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56064:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his luſts ſpurred on faſter, and boild up higher by Satans fires,
then one of leſſe. The eſtimate of our growth muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be taken by a ſtep or two, but by a conſtant courſe; for as
a mans ſincerity is to be meaſured, ſo is his growth: even as a
mans health is to be meaſured by the conſtant tenor of his
temper.</p>
               <p>Onely,<note place="margin">This Caution explicated by three things. 1.</note> I will adde three things to give further direction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ſuch extraordinary caſes of temptation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it is certaine, that ſo much corruption as at ſuch a
time and in ſuch a fit a man felt a ſtirring in him, ſo much indeed
and in truth there is of corruption in his heart; for the devill
can put none in, but onely acts, and doth improve what is there
already: for as that ſpeech of Chriſt implyes, Satan can work
but according to the matter he findeth in us: <hi>(He commeth and
findeth no matter in me)</hi> the wind adds no water to the ſea, onely
can make the waves to riſe, and ſurge; the fire adds nothing to
the water, when it is ſet upon it, but attenuates it onely, and
cauſeth it to boile. And ſo in <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when he was caſt into
that fit of pride, the Text ſayes, <hi>That it was that he might know
all that was in his heart, 2 Chron. 32. 31.</hi> It was in his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> I adde, that yet hence it cannot be infallibly inferred,
that a man hath comparatively either to himſelfe more corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in him then he had twenty yeeres afore, becauſe more is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up; or that comparatively to others he hath more corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then they, becauſe more is now for a fit drawne forth: So
that it follows not from hence, that others which are kept free
from ſuch a temptation, that they have leſſe mortification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were never caſt into ſo hot and burning a fit. One
whoſe body is leſſe full of humours, and naturally of a more
moderate temper for heat, may yet through ſome accident or
other, or diſeaſe, ſuppoſe the Plague, be caſt into hotter fits of a
burning Feaver, then one whoſe temper is more fiery, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
more abounding in him. To have recourſe to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
inſtance. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſurely had more corruption twenty
yeeres before his recovery out of his ſickneſſe, then at that time,
and yet it wrought not ſo, that we reade of, as it did then; not
that the barrell was then fuller, but that now it was broached
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56064:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lower, and a greater vent given, and ſo it came more guſhing out,
dregs and all. That a man after he is growne up to his full
ſtrength, falls into ſo great a ſickneſſe, ſuch an one as he never
had when he was a child, which maketh him weaker then when
he was ten or twelve yeeres old, doth not argue but that he is
a man grown for all that. <hi>David</hi> after a long growth, had a
time of great ſickneſſe, whereby he loſt the exerciſe, the lively
vigorous uſe of his graces: enfeebled by that ſickneſſe, he loſt his
taſte in Gods Ordinances by it, and <hi>the joy of Gods ſalvation,</hi> as
appears by the 51. <hi>Pſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the third thing I would adde is this, that ſuch an one as
is indeed much mortified,<note place="margin">3.</note> if it happens he falls into ſuch a fit,
yet the greater meaſure of his mortification will apeare after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
in that the luſt will be weaker after his recoverie againe.
It is in this, as with a man that is in a hot fierie fit of a feaver,
though he have at that inſtant the ſtrength of two men in him,
(as was ſaid) yet afterward, when the ſpirits are ebbed and ſetled
againe, his body is the weaker for it: ſo is the body of ſin, upon
the reſurrection of grace, after ſuch a fall. Many grow more
after ſickneſſe. For Gods end being but to diſcover his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
(and what he is in himſelfe) and to rouze him out of his
ſecurity, he then loves to manifeſt his power when once we have
ſeene our weakneſſe; and ſo <hi>makes his ſtrength perfect in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi>
when they are not ordinary, but beyond the ordinary
temper and diſpoſitions of our ſpirits.</p>
               <p>But then the Queſtion may be concerning the more ordinary
paſſages of a mans life,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſtion.</hi> Whether an eſtimate may be taken from the ordinary paſſages of our lives.</note> whether a man may meaſure and take a
ſure eſtimate of the inward root of corruption left in him, by the
ordinary riſings and ſtirrings of it, and his fallings into ſin more
or leſſe. I ſpeak not now of extraordinary fits, but of ordinary
qualms and weakneſſes.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Reſolved.</note> that ordinarily men may conclude from the
more or leſſe buſie they find corruption to be in them, that the
more or leſſe there is of corruption in them; and ſo thereby
meaſure their growth: for grace and corruption are as two
<hi>roots,</hi> (and therefore the actions of them both are called <hi>their
fruits, Gal. 5. 17, 22.)</hi> Now Chriſt elſewhere gives us this rule of
nature, to <hi>judge of the tree by the fruits,</hi> to proceed by, in matters
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56064:47"/>
of grace alſo; And as by the fruit we may know of what <hi>ſpecies</hi>
and kind the tree is of, ſo likewiſe what plenty of ſap there is at
the root, by the plenty, or bigneſſe, or faireneſſe of the fruit it
doth bring forth: the more inward corruption at the root, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
the more fruit thereof appears in the life: and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
alſo of the tender fruits of the the ſpirit. And therefore
Chriſt here ſayes, that the Vine is <hi>to be purged, that it may bring
forth more fruit;</hi> becauſe the more corruption is emptied, the
more holineſſe will appeare in your inward and outward fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.
And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe ordinarily as a <hi>thing
is in being, ſo it is in working. Laeſa principia habent laeſas opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones.</hi>
Children, the weaker, the more falls they have in their
ordinary walkings; bodies, the more ſickly, or the weaker and
more unhealthy the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and conſtitution is, the more qualmes;
and as they recover ſtrength more and more, they find they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow
ſuch weakneſſes: and therefore ordinarily according to
what activeneſſe a man finds of grace or ſin in him, according to
what activeneſſe a man finds of grace or ſin in him, according are
the inward principles of either of them more or leſſe in him:
for the ſoule of man, as it is an active thing, ſo being left to its
ordinary courſe, it acts according to the ſway, and bias, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the habits that are in it, which are alſo active, as both
grace and ſinne are. As a bowle, when the force of the hand
that threw it begins to decay, it is ſwayed by the bias, and lead
that is in it; and ſo the leſſe grace, the leſſe ordinarily it acts
graciouſly, and the weaklier; and then alſo the oppoſite cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
muſt needs be ſo much the more active: for the ſoule
being active, abates not of its mettle, but it will ſtill ſhew it
ſelfe one way or other. The fleſh will <hi>luſt againſt the ſpirit</hi> ſo much
the ſtronglier, as the ſpirit is weaker, <hi>for they are contrary;</hi> yea
and thus God judgeth of the principles of grace in us, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as they act in us; he will judge of our mortification, by the
fruits of it in our lives and hearts; the more the fruits of ſin
grow on in us, the leſſe morrified he will account us; as he will
judge of <hi>faith by the works,</hi> ſo of mortification by the fruits: and
therefore it is obſerveable, that he bids us <hi>mortifie the deeds of the
body,</hi> as well as the body of ſinne, <hi>Rom. 8. 13.</hi> for God will
judge of the one by the other. Therefore the objects of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56064:48"/>
are the deeds of the body, as well as the inward principle
of corruption, becauſe the mortification of the inward principle
will be ſeene and appeare in the deeds.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that Grace is acted, or luſts doe ſtir,
accordingly as the Spirit of Chriſt, who is a voluntary Agent,
doth act Grace, or will leave a man, ſo that if he be pleaſed to
ſtir that little grace in a weak Chriſtian, he ſhall act it more,
and if he leave a ſtrong Chriſtian to himſelfe, he ſhall fall
more.</p>
               <p>But to this it is anſwered,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that though the holy Ghoſt be a voluntary Agent, and
blowes when and where he pleaſeth, for his times of working,
yet ordinarily he acteth grace in us, (take our whole courſe) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the proportion of grace given us, ſo as he that hath
more habituall grace, ſhall be more aſſiſted and enlivened, which
falls out according to that rule, which in this caſe will hold, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benti
dabitur, Mat. 25. 29. To him that hath ſhall be given,</hi> if it be
a true talent: Hence therefore he that had five talents, gained
more then he that had but two; for he gained his five more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his two; the other but two more to his former two:
though he that had but one, is ſaid to have gained none, becauſe
indeed it was not a true talent, for he <hi>ſeemed but to have it,</hi> the
Text ſayes. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe thoſe habits of
grace which God hath infuſed, are his owne worke, and are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by him to be acted, and he delights ſtill to crowne his
owne works in us with more. And as he proportions glory to
works, ſo he promiſeth to act according to the principles of
grace infuſed, which elſe would be in vaine, they being ordained
to that end: As the Apoſtle ſayes of <hi>gifts,</hi> that they are <hi>given
to profit withall;</hi> ſo are graces to work, and therefore ordinarily
God draws them out, where he hath beſtowed them, as he doth
gifts alſo, according to their proportion: and thus <hi>è contra</hi> it is
for leaving a man to ſin; the more corruption a man hath, the
more ordinarily he lets it vent and diſcover it ſelfe, that ſo men
that have many corruptions in them, might know what is in their
hearts; and ſo when God doth mortifie them in them to thanke
him the more, the grace of which elſe would be to them loſt, if
God ſhould mortifie their luſts in them, without their ſeeing and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56064:48"/>
bewailing them, and crying to him, <hi>Oh miſerable man that I am;</hi>
and ordinarily ſee and diſcerne them, men would not, unleſſe
left to them. As in caſe of humbling a man, though God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
doth humble a man that hath leſſe ſinnes, more then one
that hath greater, to ſhew that he can give a ſpirituall light to ſee
more ſinne in a little then others in much; yet ordinarily thoſe
are moſt humbled that have beene greateſt ſinners, as <hi>Manaſſes
humbled himſelfe greatly,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen loved much,</hi> and
the Apoſtle thought himſelfe <hi>the greateſt of ſinners:</hi> And thus it
is in acting grace, or letting forth corruptions, it is according to
their principles within.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, that very acting grace doth increaſe habits: ſo
as the increaſe of habits and inward mortification is proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
according to the acting of grace by the holy Ghoſt; for
every abſtinence doth mortifie, as was ſaid, and every act of
grace doth through the bleſſing of the Spirit further ſanctifie and
increaſe the habit, <hi>Rom. 6. You have your fruit in holineſſe.</hi> When
they doe any duty, it makes the heart more inwardly holy: ſo as
indeed the one cannot be without the other; but the more a
man doth abſtaine out of right principles, by the aſſiſtance of the
Spirit, the more he grows: ſo as in the end all comes to one;
he whoſe holineſſe is acted moſt, hath in the end moſt habituall
grace, and thereby often it comes to paſſe, that <hi>he that is firſt,
comes to be laſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Two limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                  <hi>and he that is laſt, firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet there are two limitations to be put in about this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I grant, for ſome times of mens lives, that God doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
act ſome mens graces more, who have yet leſſe grace, and leave
thoſe to ſinnes who have more grace. So he left <hi>Peter</hi> who
in all appearance had more grace then any of the twelve, yet
God left him to deny Chriſt more foulely and falſly then any of
the other.</p>
               <p>But then let the ends of God be conſidered why he doth it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in caſe of too much confidence upon inherent grace, and
the ſtrength of it: When we truſt to habituall grace received,
then Chriſt, to ſhew that it is a new grace, to aſſiſt that grace,
and to the end that it may be acknowledged that he that
gives one grace, is not bound to give another, may in this caſe
leave one that hath indeed more grace to the prevailing of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56064:49"/>
more. It falls out ſometimes that when men are young
Chriſtians, and new borne, God adds much aſſiſtance, and this
for their encouragement; and as you carry young children in
your armes, and ſo they are kept from falls more then ſome
more elderly that are let goe alone. Thus <hi>Hoſ. 11. 3. God takes
them by the armes when a child, ver. 1. but then they acknowledge it
not,</hi> as it follows there, and are apt to think that that ſtrength
and life they have, is from themſelves, and ſo God afterwards
leaves them, when grown men more elderly. Thoſe Chriſtians
who walk moſt ſenſibly of their owne weakneſſe, and obſerve
God his keeping them from ſin, and attribute this to him, ſuch
God delights to help, though for the preſent they have leſſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall
grace: And ſo thoſe Chriſtians that ſooner come to the
knowledge of that way of dependance upon Chriſt, (ſome come
to ſee it the firſt day, and make uſe of it; others not ſo clearely
a long while) they ſhall be more aſſiſted then another. To many
that way ſo ſoone is not ſo clearly opened.</p>
               <p>Again, ſecondly, ſometimes God will magnifie this his <hi>acting
grace,</hi> (as I may call it) more in one man then in another, ſeeing
it is a <hi>grace.</hi> That one Apoſtle of the Gentiles, <hi>Paul,</hi> did more
then all the Apoſtles, ſhall we thereby infallibly conclude he had
more inherent grace then they all? but that he had more aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
As God ſometimes uſeth men of weaker gifts to doe
more then men of greater, ſo men of weaker graces, and leſſe
growth, to ſhame the other. As there are <hi>diverſities of gifts, ſo of
operations and exerciſe</hi> of thoſe gifts, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 6.</hi> the <hi>Spirit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
as he will, ver. 11.</hi> God caſts aſide one of eminent gifts
into a place or condition wherein they are not uſefull, and ſo he
may one of much habituall grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he acts often according to <hi>actuall</hi> preparation;
the <hi>habituall</hi> preparation lies in habits, and is more remote;
as ſtrings may be good, yet out of tune, and ſo not plaid upon.</p>
               <p>Againe, fourthly, God may leave a Chriſtian of more grace
and growth, to more ſtirring of corruptions, in caſe he means yet
to bring him to a higher pitch of humiliation, and that by ſins.
It is in this his dealing of leaving men to corruptions, and the
vigorous conflicts with them, as it is in his leaving his people
ſometimes to thoſe other evils of afflictions. God humbleth
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56064:49"/>
his, either by afflictions or by ſins, and his manner in both is
ſometimes alike; you ſhall ſee one who hath attained to a great
meaſure of grace already, and that by affliction, and yet never to
be out of the fire, but God ſtill followeth him with one affliction
or another; whereas one of leſſe growth and grace, who in that
regard hath more need, ſhall have fewer afflictions in his courſe:
And what is the reaſon of this difference? it is not that the
grown Chriſtian hath ſimply more need of affliction then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but becauſe God intends to bring him on yet to a further
degree of grace. As refiners of ſugar taking ſugars out of the ſame
cheſt, ſome thereof they melt but once, and another part of it
they melt and refine againe and againe; not that <hi>that</hi> which they
refine twice, hath more droſſe in it, but becauſe they would have it
more refined, double refined. And as God deales thus in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſo alſo in leaving of his people to the ſtirring of corruptions,
which of all afflictions is the greateſt to humble a holy heart. And
thus in experience it is found, that he doth ſometimes leave a
grown Chriſtian to conflict with corruptions more then a weaker
Chriſtian; not that he hath more in him, but becauſe he means
to bring on that grown Chriſtian to a further degree of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
he is not humbled as he meanes to have him yet. And
whereas God humbleth ſome men by afflictions, he humbleth
others by ſins; and nothing humbleth more then ſins, for croſſes
doe but humble by revealing ſin, as the cauſe; and nothing will
humble a grown Chriſtian more then to ſee ſuch ſhamefull foule
corruptions ſtill ſtirring in him, the greateſt aggravation of which
to him will be in this, that after ſo long a time, ſuch luſts ſhould
be ſo lively in him, to have ſuch groſſe faults in his exerciſes after
he hath been ſo long at ſchoole, this ſhames him; For a growne
Chriſtian to be diſguiſed with a corruption; and when his haire
is growne, to have it ſhaven off, as <hi>Davids</hi> meſſengers were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
of it; ſo how doth it ſhame him, and humble him?
Thus <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> though he was much humbled by a ſickneſſe to
death, but becauſe he was not humbled enough, and ſo far as
God meant to bring him: therefore God let looſe Pride on
him, and then he further <hi>humbleth himſelfe and all Iſrael,</hi> as it is
2 <hi>Chron. 32. 26.</hi> Upon ſome men God ſhews his free grace in
keeping them from ſinne; upon others he ſpends it in pardoning
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56064:50"/>
them: Theſe are but two ſeverall wayes he hath of laying it out:
And ſo ſometimes he ſhewes his grace in keeping thoſe of leſſe
grace, and againe in letting thoſe of more to ſtruggle with their
luſts: and ſuch ſickneſſes are not to death, or to weaken them,
but for the glory of God, and their further growth; for this
will be the effect and conſequent of ſuch ſtirrings in growne
Chriſtians, that as their fits of corruptions ſtirring are great, ſo
their humblings will be greater: Grace being much in them,
will ſhew it ſelfe that way; great fits of ſinning have intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with them great exerciſes of repentings; and the growth
of their grace will ſhew it ſelfe in them, and appeare in them;
even as in men that are cheerfull naturally, but ſometimes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with melancholy; when thoſe preſſures are over, they
are moſt merry, their ſpirits breaking forth being at liberty, they
ſhew themſelves as much on the contrary in mirth: ſo is it here,
when grace gets above againe. As it is in the body, when the
ſpirits are not weak, but onely are kept under by humours, when
they doe once get up, they then ſhew their ſtrength in cauſing the
body to grow the more: as in many young men, after a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
where ſtrength of nature is; and ſo thereby they become
after often the better, and more lively; but if the naturall ſpirits
be weak, it is not ſo.</p>
               <p>A ſecond limitation is,<note place="margin">2. Limitation.</note> that though one of leſſe growth in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
may ſometimes by watchfulneſſe keep under his luſts
more, and act that little grace he hath, more then haply he doth,
who hath yet radically more grace: therefore ſayes the Apoſtle,
<hi>Stir up the gift that is in thee:</hi> To <hi>Timothy</hi> he ſpeakes it, and he
exhorts, <hi>Gal. 5.</hi> even young Chriſtians <hi>to walke in the ſpirit:</hi> that
is, to have the ſpirit kept above the fleſh, ſo as a man ſhall have
great hand over his corruptions, that they breake not forth:
Now I ſay, that this exhortation doth belong unto, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the youngeſt Chriſtians. For he ſpeakes to all that have ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
life begun in them, <hi>ver. 25. If we live in the Spirit, let us,</hi>
ſayes he, <hi>walke in the Spirit,</hi> and then <hi>we ſhall not fulfill the luſts
of the fleſh, ver. 16.</hi> A weake body, thouh weake, yet if he uſeth
care, may keepe himſelfe from diſtempers, as much as ſome man
who is ſtrong, but grows careleſſe, and neglects his health.
But yet though one of leſſe grace be thus actually more
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56064:50"/>
watchfull, ye he may diſcerne the want of growth by this:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that ſtill his luſts riſe oftner, and that with delight; and
are apter to catch fire preſently, although they be ſmothered as
faſt as they catch; his caſe then is as if there were an heap of
ſtraw in a roome where fire is, where ſparks fly about ſtill taking
fire upon every occaſion, but he that keeps the ſtraw, is carefull
ſtill to put it out.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, in this caſe they ſhall find the ſtrength of their
corruptions in privative working againſt grace, and diſtracting
and diſturbing them, deading their hearts in duties: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the Apoſtle had exhorted ſuch to <hi>walk in the ſpirit,
ſo as not to fulfill the luſts,</hi> marke what follows, <hi>Yet,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>the
fleſh will diſcover it ſelfe in luſting againſt the ſpirit.</hi> Take what
care you will; ſo as a man <hi>ſhall not be able to doe what he would,
Gal. 5. 16, 17.</hi> and the more ſtrong it is, the more it will ſhew
it ſelfe ſtrong in diſturbing; ſo as Chriſtians not growne up that
are very watchfull over their hearts, doe keepe as it were but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Sabbaths, and are therein like unto thoſe watchers and
keepers of good rule in great Churches, where there are many
ſleepers, they have ſo much to doe to watch thoſe boyes that
ſleepe, and are idle at Church, as they cannot attend the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
For though by reaſon of watchfulneſſe corruption may be
kept from diſcovering it ſelfe in open unrulineſſe much, yet it
can never by all the watchfulneſſe in the world be brought on to
duties, but ſo much as is in the heart will diſcover it ſelfe either
in oppoſition to them, or an hypocriticall joyning in them:
although the Papiſts may be kept by a waking State from vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that malice of their hearts in rebellion, yet they cannot be
brought to joyne with us in holy duties; no more will corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
unleſſe in hypocriſie, and therefore ſo much as is, doth ſtill
diſcover it ſelfe in them.</p>

               <head type="sub">Five Cautions more to prevent ſuch miſ-judgings.</head>
               <p>A Third Caution to prevent miſ-judging; if a man will not
be miſtaken in judging his growth in Mortification compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively
with others, or with himſelfe, he muſt conſider his <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions</hi>
and <hi>opportunities</hi> to draw him out, thus: A man when he
had more corruption, yet leſſe occaſions and provocations to
ſinne, may have corruption leſſe ſtirring in him, then when he is
more grown up in grace, if his temptations were then greater:
The ſame tree ſtanding in the ſhade, where alſo the raine comes
not to it, when tranſplanted, where both ſunne and raine fall
upon it, may be more fruitfull then formerly. <hi>David,</hi> when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
afflictions in the wilderneſſe, and wanting opportunities, how
ſtrict was he,<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.</note> and <hi>kept himſelfe from his iniquity?</hi> but when he
came to the delicacies of a Kingdome, though he was grown
up ſtill more and more in grace, yet how did he fall? As to
aggravate the ſinne of not growing more, the proportion of
meanes every one hath had is to be conſidered; and for one who
hath had much meanes to grow much, for him is leſſe, then one
who hath leſſe meanes: So in the ſtirring or declining of ſinne,
opportunities and occaſions are alſo to be conſidered; as if a
man be tranſplanted out of a full condition into an empty, if
then many of his luſts doe not ſtir ſo much as afore, no wonder.
Even as if a man when caſt into a ſweat by reaſon of multitude
of cloathes, it is no marvaile, if when cloathes are taken off, he
ſweat leſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A fourth thing to be conſidered, to keepe us from miſtakes
herein, is, that he whoſe ſpirit is naturally active, his luſts, though
weaker then another mans whoſe ſpirit is ſlower, may be yet
more quick and apt to break forth more then his. <hi>Peter</hi> was of a
bold ſpirit, and ſo ſpake often raſhly, and vented corruption
more then the other Diſciples, in ſo much as he once provoked
Chriſt to call him <hi>Satan,</hi> not that he had leſſe grace, but a
more active ſpirit; yea he might have more grace, and leſſe of
corruption ſtirred in him, onely a more forward naturall ſpirit,
that was apt to put it ſelfe forth. As an angry man, whoſe ſpirit
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56064:51"/>
is quick, may ſoone be ſtirred, and in the forwardneſſe of his
ſpirit to action, give a man a blow, when one given to malice
will ſcarce give you an ill word, whoſe luſts of revenge yet burne
inwardly more. Gunpowder will take and fall into a blaze
ſooner then Lime, yet lime hath more innate heat, and burns
more within; ſome have ſpeeder vent. Thoſe two brethren,
<hi>John</hi> and <hi>James, ſonnes of Thunder,</hi> as Chriſt calls them, how ſoone
was their choler up? They had quick and hot ſpirits, as Chriſt
tels them, <hi>Ye know not what ſpirit ye are of Luke 9. 55.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, if we would judge aright, what meaſure of true morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
is in us, we muſt not take into the reckoning what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
grace doth in us, but obſerve that apart, and caſt that up
in a ſumme by it ſelfe. For this you muſt know, that even in the
regenerate, all their abſtinence from ſins is not from meere mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
but reſtraining grace continues even after regeneration
to contribute to it, and ſo make mortification ſeeme the greater.
It was not meerely and onely mortification of the luſt of Anger
that made <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo meeke; for at another time, when he was
left, what a chafe was he in, when he called them all Rebels and
ſaid in an heat, that he muſt fetch water out of the rock for
them? It was his temper and diſpoſition of nature, helpt to
make him ſo eminent in ruling that paſſion above any other,
that he is ſaid to be <hi>the meekeſt man on earth.</hi> It was not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
meerly mortification, that made that great Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> ſo eminently chaſte; but over and beſides what morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
helpt him in it, he had a <hi>peculiar gift,</hi> as he calls it, 1 <hi>Cor.
7. 7.</hi> he ſpeaks of it as of a gift, not a grace, ſuch as might be in
Reprobates; <hi>For,</hi> ſayes he there, <hi>Every one hath his proper gift.</hi>
So it was not meere mortification that made <hi>Luther</hi> never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with covetouſneſſe, but the freeneſſe and generouſneſſe of
his ſpirit that helped him in it.</p>
               <p>Now if all theſe would have caſt up what grace and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they had attained to, they muſt have reckoned reſtraining
grace by it ſelfe, (which may be obſerved by what our vertues
were before converſion) which though now ſanctified, that is
helping forward Sanctification, and making the abſtinence eaſier,
yet is not to be reckoned true Sanctification; as Goldſmiths
mingle in all the ſilver they work ſome other metals to make it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56064:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more malleable; ſo are thoſe common graces mingled with true
in this life, where Sanctification is imperfect, which doe help
them and eeke them out. Grace ſet in a good nature, ſeemes a
great deale more, and goes farther then in a bad. Wine that is of
it ſelfe ſomewhat pleaſant, a little ſugar will make it ſweeter to
the taſte, then a great deale of ſugar will doe ſowre wine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let every one conſider, what naturall ingenuity, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
and education did in him before converſion; and let him
know, that now he hath true grace; theſe help him ſtill, and
ſtand him in ſtead as much as ever, although he hath a further new
principle of grace in him, beyond theſe. Grace in this life, and
whilſt imperfect, takes not away ſuch common gifts, but ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
and uſeth them as the reaſonable ſoule doth a quick fancie
or memory, which are ſenſitive faculties, and doe make his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to abſtaine from ſuch and ſuch ſins more eaſie: indeed all ſuch
gifts will be ſwallowed up in glory: And therefore many who
have leſſe grace, yet ſeeme in many carriages more mortified
then thoſe who have more grace; they will be leſſe impatient in
a croſſe, leſſe ſtirred and provoked with an injurie. A man who
hath beene leſſe helpt by reſtraining grace before converſion,
and had his luſts more outragious, if he hath them now under,
it is a ſigne he hath much more mortification in him then one
who was naturally civill. And I appeal to every godly mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
it is not only ſimply mortification that makes him always
to abſtaine from ſins, but ſhame, modeſty, terrors of conſcience
ſtrike in at a pinch, when ſtrength of mortification had failed
him elſe; and many accidentall things, ordered by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
hinder and keepe Gods people from ſinning: and as
<hi>David</hi> was faine to make uſe of <hi>Goliahs</hi> ſword, and take in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
perſons that had not the ſame ends that he had to
ſtrengthen himſelfe againſt <hi>Saul;</hi> ſo is grace faine to take in
fleſhly diſlikes and diſcontents againſt ſin, to help it in a pinch,
till it hath got the victory. For inſtance, it was not <hi>Judahs</hi> grace
ſo much kept him from killing <hi>Joſeph,</hi> for then he would not
have conſented to ſell him; but nature wrought in him, and
made him abhor the killing him: <hi>Is it not our brother, and our
fleſh, and what profit is it to kill him? Gen. 37. 26.</hi> So God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<hi>David</hi> in his murthering <hi>Nabals</hi> family by an externall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56064:52"/>
meanes, when as his grace elſe had not kept him from revenging
himſelfe cauſeleſly upon his family, (for they were in no fault)
his grace alone had not done it, for his paſſion was up, and he in
a rage, and fully reſolved to doe it; but God uſed another
meanes, and ſent <hi>Abigail</hi> ſubmiſſively to meet him; and her
lowly ſubmiſſion, and elegant oration, won him, and cooled
him; though this <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth Gods hand in it, and
was glad he was ſo kept (as a godly man will, and hath cauſe,
when he is hindred of his purpoſe in ſinning, as he ſayes, <hi>I rejoyce
that Chriſt is preached, though out of envie;</hi> ſo if ſin be abſtained
from, though by any meanes) yet God did rather by his meanes
reſtraine him, then by his feare of God, or the grace in his heart;
but God kept him by her comming: 1 <hi>Sam. 25. 34.</hi> For in very deed,
ſayes <hi>David, as the Lord liveth, which hath kept me back from hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thee, except thou hadſt haſted and met me, ſurely there had not
beene left a man unto Nabal.</hi> So ſhame moved <hi>Judah;</hi> feare of
being deſtroyed moved <hi>Jacob</hi> to reprove the ſin of his ſonnes,
and is all the argument he uſeth, <hi>Gen. 34. 30.</hi> So that in an
evening, when thou caſteſt up thy abſtinences of that day, think
not how much thou haſt abſtained from ſin, or denyed thy ſelfe,
but how much out of hatred of it, and the ſpirit of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
how much of that there is in thy abſtinence, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
meaſure thy growth in it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, another falſe rule is, when men judge of their morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and the meaſure of it, by their preſent liſtleſneſſe of the
heart to ſin; which though it be true, that where true mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is, there is a liſtleſneſſe, and a deadneſſe; and ſo much
mortification, ſo much deadneſſe, <hi>Rom. 6. 2. How ſhall we that
are dead to ſinne, live any longer therein?</hi> And indeed, to live in
it, is to take pleaſure in it: But yet this you muſt know, there
are many things which in a godly man may adde to his deadneſſe
to ſinne, beſides true mortification, and ſo make it ſeeme greater
then it is in truth: And therefore it may be a falſe rule to judge
by, if it be not warily conſidered and diſtinguiſhed. Sickneſſe
breeds a liſtleſneſſe; when we are ſick, our luſts are ſick together
with us; and as we gather ſtrength, they gather up their crums
againe, <hi>Job 33. 19. 20.</hi> then <hi>his ſoule abhors dainty food.</hi> Suppoſe
he be a glutton: Old age brings a liſtleſneſſe. <hi>Eccleſ. 12. 1.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56064:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
When the evill dayes come, wherein a man ſayes, he hath no pleaſure
in them:</hi> as <hi>Barzillai</hi> had no taſte in his meat, by reaſon of old
age. So when our expectations or deſires are croſſed, or are like
to be, and we begin to faile of thoſe maine props of the comfort
of our lives, we are apt to have a liſtleſneſſe to all other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:
when ſome one thing that was a ſawce to all the reſt, is
gone or like to goe, we then have no ſtomach to all the reſt, and
we are weary of living, as <hi>David</hi> was when <hi>Abſalom</hi> was gone,
<hi>would I had dyed for thee.</hi> Some great croſſe comming, may like
thunder ſowre all our joyes and delights, and make them ſtale
to us, and as dead drink to the ſtomach. Terror of conſcience
may like an eclipſe overſpread our ſpirits, and then all things loſe
their beauty and luſtre, as things in the dark uſe to doe: as <hi>Job</hi>
ſayes of himſelfe in his deſertion, that <hi>his ſoule had no more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
in all comforts, then in white of an egge: For ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
as theſe doe draw the intention another way, and doe
take the mind up about Gods wrath, or the afflictions we are in,
ſo as it cannot run out to ſin; and intention, you know, is the
cauſe of all pleaſure. As therefore when by ſtudy the ſpirits are
drawn up to the head, a mans ſtomach decayes to that meat he
moſt loved; ſo when terrors drinke up the ſpirits, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks:
but when that heat is over, and intention diſmiſſed, a man reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
his ſtomach againe; and ſo doe men their appetites, to
ſinne, when they come forth of terrors. And this will help you
to find out the true reaſon, why that young Chriſtians are often
more dead to all pleaſures of ſinne, then thoſe who are grown
up, or then themſelves are when grown up: they are often then
altogether dead to all mirth and other contentments, and yet
they are not more mortified then afterwards: For then legall
humiliation adds to their deadneſſe. And beſides that firſt deadly
blow which Chriſt gave their luſts then in part, the Law alſo and
the bitterneſſe of ſinne did lay that part of their luſts which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
unkilled, in a ſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e, that one would think all were
dead. <hi>Sin revived,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, and I dyed, Rom. 7.</hi> He ſpeaks of
that time when he lay humbled for ſinne; during which time, we
reade in the <hi>Acts,</hi> he faſted: He had no mind to meat nor
drink, for three dayes, he forgot all. And againe, as then they
are uſually ſo taken up about pardon of ſinne, and the obtaining
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56064:53"/>
thereof, that all the ſpirits retire to the heart to relieve it, and to
encourage it to ſeeke out for pardon; and ſo ſinne is left in a
ſwoune, and it ſeemes quite dead: but by degrees men come out
of that ſwoune, and ſinne revives, and then men think they decay
in mortification. Againe, young Chriſtians ſometimes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
afterwards for ſome hony-moones of their lives, are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with raptures, and raviſhments, joy unſpeakable and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and then they ſeeme in a manner wholly dead to ſin, and
walk ſo, but as the other are in a ſwoune, ſo they are in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie;
but when they are out of it, then ſinne comes to it ſelfe
againe: Thoſe joyes whilſt they laſt, make a mans actuall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
deadneſſe to ſin ſeem more then habitually and radically it is
indeed: As a man that hath taſted ſome ſweet thing, whilſt the
impreſſion upon his palate laſteth, he hath no reliſh of meat;
ſo whilſt the impreſſions of ſpirituall joy: but when their
mouthes are waſht once, and their ſenſe of that ſweetneſſe gone,
they find their wonted reliſh of them. Thus ſpirituall joyes doe,
for the time they are upon the heart, much alter the taſte; but
yet much of that alteration is adventitious and not wholly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall,
or altering the ſinfull faculty it ſelfe (though it doth adde
much that way) yet not ſo much as they ſeeme to doe at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
the ſenſe of that ſweetneſſe is freſh in his heart.</p>
               <p>Now therefore to give an help or two to difference what
is reall and true <hi>Mortification,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Two differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betweene <hi>Mortification,</hi> and a ſeeming <hi>deadneſſe</hi> or liſtleſneſſe to ſinne.</note> from this ſeeming <hi>liſtleſneſſe</hi> and
<hi>deadneſſe</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, true mortification makes a man not onely liſtleſſe to
ſinne, but to have a quick hatred againſt it, a hatred aiming at
the deſtruction of it; but falſe liſtleſneſſe takes but the heart off
it, doth not ſet it againſt it; how often are theſe yoaked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Pſal. 119. I hate ſinne, and every falſe way,</hi> with this, <hi>Thy
law doe I love?</hi> the heart being quickned with love to God, and
to his Law, is carried out againſt ſinne, and not onely taken off
from it to have no mind <hi>to it,</hi> but to have a mind <hi>againſt it,</hi> to
deſtroy it. There is the ſame difference betweene <hi>mortification</hi>
and <hi>liſtleſneſſe,</hi> that there is between true <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>ſenſleſneſſe;</hi>
ſenſeleſneſſe is a dull, ſullen, ſtupid bearing pains, but patience is
joyned mith a quick ſenſe of them, which ariſeth from ſtrength of
ſpirits, that being quick and vigorous, are the more ſenſible of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56064:54"/>
paine or pleaſure; ſo true mortification is joyned with an active
hatred that flyes out againſt ſin; which come from livelineſſe of
affection to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Difference.</note> true mortification is joyned with activeneſſe and
life in the contrary duties, <hi>Rom. 6. 11. Reckon your ſelves dead
unto ſinne, and alive unto God.</hi> That falſe liſtleſneſſe is but a dead
palſey that doth take theſe members of ſinne, but true mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is with a new life, a reſurrection, ſtrengthning a man to
<hi>walke</hi> ſo much the more nimbly <hi>in the wayes of God. Rom. 6. 4, 5.</hi>
Young Chriſtians, and ſuch as have a falſe liſtleſneſſe and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
you ſhall find them complaine that their <hi>mortification</hi> is
more then <hi>vivification,</hi> they will finde they are more dead to the
world, then quickned to God. True mortification doth not dull
the ſpirits, but ſets them at liberty, as purging the humours out
doth; it makes the body more light and nimble; whereas falſe
liſtleſneſſe cauſeth a deadneſſe, a dulneſſe to every thing elſe.
Thoſe falſe cauſes of liſtleſneſſe contract the mind, as a <hi>bladder</hi>
that is clung, and dryed, and <hi>hung up in the ſmoake,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi>
compared his condition in terrors of conſcience) but mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
empties it of the ſinne, and fils it with grace, ſo as the mind
is as full and wide as before, onely filled with grace now in ſtead
of ſinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, a man is not to judge of his growth in mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſimply by the <hi>keenneſſe</hi> of his affection againſt ſinne, though
that is good and bleſſed, but by his <hi>ſtrength</hi> againſt it. As there
is a fond love, which is not ſo ſtrong and ſolid, which will not
doe ſo much for one; or hold, if it come to the tryall, and be
put to it, that yet hath a more ſeeming edge in it; ſo there is a
keenneſſe of hatred, that hath not ſo much ſtrength. A man that
is angry ſeemes to have more keenneſſe of affection againſt him
he falls out with, and in his rage vows never to be reconciled,
and could eat him up; when as yet a malicious man hates more
ſtrongly: So doe young Chriſtians their ſins, having lately felt
the bitterneſſe of them; and then many other inconveniences,
beſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s the cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arietie of them to God, doe egge on and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
their ſpirits againſt them; but like as a ſharpe knife that is
weak, the edge is ſoone turned and blunted, ſo in a temptation,
they are for all their edge ſoone overcome: for all thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56064:54"/>
inconveniences and apprehenſions of their hurt by them,
makes their ſpleen indeed greater, but it adds not to their ſtrength
and courage to reſiſt them: like a ſtomachfull boy, that cryes
he cannot have the victory, yet is weak, and eaſily laid on his
back, his ſtomach is more then his ſtrength. The hurt that comes
by ſin to us at firſt lately felt, helps to <hi>ſharpen the edge,</hi> but <hi>adds
no metall,</hi> and ſo our weapons are beaten to our heads againe,
when we uſe them. What an edge of ſpirit had <hi>Peter</hi> raiſed up
againſt denying Chriſt? he would die rather; he ſpake then as
he thought; and he would have dyed in the quarrell, for he
draws his ſword, but afterwards he wanted ſtrength to his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
how eaſily was he overcome, being yet but weak in grace?
therefore judge of your growth herein, by your ſtrength to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.
Hence the Apoſtle prayes, <hi>they may have ſtrength in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, Eph. 3.</hi> and in <hi>Chap. 6. 13.</hi> he ſpeaks of <hi>ability to
ſtand in the evill day.</hi> Although this let me adde, that every man
ſhould keep up his heart in this continuall keenneſſe and edge
of ſpirit againſt ſin, and whet his heart againſt it: For that will
cauſe a man to uſe his ſtrength the more againſt it, and to put
it forth. A man that keeps his heart in a revengefull, vext, ſpleen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſpirit againſt ſin, he will eaſier cut through a temptation;
and though if a Chriſtian want metall, though he hath an edge,
he may be foiled; yet when edge and metall both meete, a man
walks above his luſts: if either be wanting, a man may be
foiled.</p>

               <head type="sub">Two Queſtions reſolved concerning Growth in Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will now conclude this Diſcourſe about <hi>Growth
in Grace</hi> with anſwering ſome Queſtions which
may be made concerning this our growth, both
about <hi>Mortification,</hi> and about <hi>increaſe in poſitive
Graces,</hi> which I did reſerve to this laſt place, that
I might handle them together.</p>
               <p>The firſt Queſtion concerning the purging out of ſinne,<note place="margin">Queſt. 1.</note> is,
<hi>Whether every new degree of Mortification, and purging out of ſinne,
be alwayes univerſall, extending it ſelfe to every ſinne?</hi> So as
the meaning of this, that God goes on to purge, ſhould be, not
onely that he goes on firſt to purge forth one ſinne, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but that he goes on to purge out by every new degree
of mortification every ſinne together; ſo as when any one
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56064:55"/>
ſinne is more weakned, all the reſt in a proportion grow weak
alſo.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer affirmatively,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that every new degree of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
is univerſall.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe when the Scripture ſpeaks of our growth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
he ſpeaks of it as extending it ſelfe to every ſinne. So <hi>Epheſ.
4. 22.</hi> when he exhorts the Epheſians (who were mortified al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready)
to a farther progreſſe in it, he exhorts them to <hi>put off
the old man, which is corrupt, according to the deceitfull luſts.</hi> It is
not one luſt that is the object of mortification, and the growth
of it (although he mentions particular luſts afterwards) but the
<hi>whole man</hi> that is <hi>corrupt,</hi> and <hi>all its luſts:</hi> and this he there
ſpeaks of daily growth therein: For of that he had ſpoken in
the former verſes, from the 12. verſe, and goes on to ſpeak of
it, and exhort to it. Thus in like manner, <hi>Gal. 5. 24.</hi> it is called
<hi>crucifying the fleſh with the luſts:</hi> not one luſt, but <hi>the fleſh,</hi> the
whole bundle, the cluſter of them all: and in that it is called
<hi>crucifying,</hi> it implys it alſo, for of all deaths that did work upon
every part, it did ſtretch every nerve, ſinew, and veyn, and
put all the parts to paine: and this going on to mortifie
ſinne is called <hi>Rom. 6. The deſtroying of the body of ſinne;</hi> of the
whole body: It is not the conſumption of one member, of the
lungs, or liver, &amp;c. but it is is <hi>conſumptio totius,</hi> a conſumption
of the whole body of ſinne, ſo as every new degree of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is the conſuming of the whole. And therefore alſo <hi>Coloſ. 3.</hi>
where in like manner he exhorts to his growth therein, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
to <hi>mortifie earthly members,</hi> every member. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
hereof are, becauſe</p>
               <p>Firſt, true mortification ſtrikes at the root, and ſo cauſeth
every branch to wither: For all ſinfull diſpoſitions are rooted
in one, namely, in <hi>love of pleaſure more then of God:</hi> and all true
imortification deads a man to the pleaſure of ſinne, by bringing
the heart more into communion, and into love with God; and
therefore the deading to any ſinne muſt needs be generall and
univerſall to every ſinne. It is as the dying of the heart, which
cauſeth all the members to die with it; for that is the difference
betweene reſtraining Grace, which cuts off but branches, and ſo
lops the tree, but true mortification ſtrikes every blow at the
root.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:56064:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Secondly, every new degree of true mortification purgeth out
<hi>a ſinne, as it is ſinne,</hi> and works againſt it under that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and if againſt it <hi>as ſinne,</hi> then the ſame power that works
out any ſinne, works againſt every ſinne in the heart alſo. Now
that every new degree works againſt a <hi>ſinne, as it is ſinne,</hi> is
plain by this, becauſe if it be purged out upon any other reſpect,
it is not mortification.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Spirit, and the virtue that comes from Chriſt,
which are the efficient cauſes of this purging out a ſinne, doe
alſo work againſt every ſinne, when they work againſt any one;
and they have a contrarietie to every luſt; they ſearch into every
veyne, and draw from all parts. Phyſitians may give <hi>elective
purges,</hi> as they call them, which will purge out one humour, and
not another, but Chriſts phyſick works generally, it takes away
all ſorts of diſtempers.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Objection againſt this may be,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that then all
luſts will come to be equally mortified.</p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> No, for all luſts were never equally alive in a man;
ſome are ſtronger, ſome weaker by cuſtome, through diſpoſition
of body and ſpirit; and therefore though mortification extends
it ſelfe to all, yet there being an inequality in the life and growth
of theſe ſinnes in us, hence ſome remaine ſtill more, ſome leſſe
mortified; as when a floud of water is left to flow into a field,
where many hils are of differing height, though the water over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows
all equally, yet ſome are more above water then others,
becauſe they were higher before of themſelves. And hence it is
that ſome ſinnes, when the power of grace comes, may be in a
manner wholly ſubdued, namely, thoſe which proceed out of the
abundance of naughtineſſe in the heart, as ſwearing, malice againſt
the truth; and theſe the children of God are uſually wholly
freed from, and they ſeeme wholly dead, being as the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of other members, and being as the nailes, and the haire,
they are wholly pared off, as was the manner to a Proſelyte
woman; the power of Grace takes them away, though other
members continue vigorous: And therefore of <hi>ſwearing</hi> Chriſt
ſayes, <hi>What is more then Yea, yea, and Nay, nay,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
out of a profarie heart: As when a man is a dying, ſome
members are ſtiffe and cold, and cleane dead long afore, as the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56064:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
feet, whilſt others continue to have ſome life and heat in them;
ſo in the mortification of a Chriſtian, ſome luſts that are more
remote, are wholly ſtiffe and ſtarke, when others retaine much
life in them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Queſtion is,<note place="margin">Queſt. 2.</note> Whether when I apply Chriſt, and
the Promiſe, with the vertue of Chriſt, for the mortification of
ſome one particular luſt or other, and doe uſe thoſe right means,
as Prayer, Faſting, &amp;c. for the ſpeciall mortification of ſome
one luſt, <hi>Whether that luſt thereby doth not become more mortified
then other luſts doe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Yes, yet ſo as in a proportion, this work of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
it runs through all the reſt: for as in waſhing out the
great ſtains of a cloth, the leſſer ſtains are waſht out alſo with
the ſame labour, ſo it is here: Therefore the Apoſtle in all his
exhortations to mortification, both <hi>Eph. 4.</hi> and <hi>Gal. 5.</hi> and <hi>Col. 3.</hi>
though he exhorts to <hi>the putting off the old man,</hi> the whole body
of ſinne, yet inſtances in particular ſins, becauſe a man is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to endeavour the mortification of particulars, as it were
apart; and yet becauſe in getting them mortified the whole
body of ſinne is deſtroyed, therefore he mentions both the whole
body, and particular members thereof apart, as the object of
mortification. And to that end alſo doth God exerciſe his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
firſt with one luſt, then with another, that they may make
tryall of the vertue of Chriſts death upon every one: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt bids us to <hi>pull out an eye,</hi> and <hi>cut off an hand,</hi> if they
offend us: for mortification is to be by us directed againſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
members; yet ſo as withall in a proportion all the reſt
receive a farther degree of deſtruction. For as a particular act
of ſin, (be it uncleannneſſe, or the like) when committed, doth
increaſe a diſpoſition to every ſinne, yet ſo as it leaves a preſent
greater diſpoſition to that particular ſin then any other, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
it moſt <hi>in potentia proxima,</hi> though all the reſt <hi>in potentia
remota:</hi> ſo in every act of mortification, though the common
ſtock be increaſed, yet the particular luſt we aimed at, hath a
greater ſhare in the mortification endeavoured, as in miniſtring
phyſick to cure the head, the whole body is often purged; yet
ſo as the head, the party affected, is yet chiefly purged, and more
then the reſt.</p>

               <head type="sub">Three Queſtions reſolved concerning Poſitive Growth.</head>
               <p>OTher Queſtions there are concerning that other part of
our growth, namely, in poſitive graces and the fruits
thereof.</p>
               <p>As firſt,<note place="margin">Queſt. 1.</note> whether every new degree of grace runs through all
the faculties?</p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Yes; For as every new degree of light in the ayre
runnes through the whole Hemiſphere, when the Sunne ſhines
clearer and clearer to the perfect day, which is <hi>Solomons</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
in the Proverbs; ſo every new degree of grace runs
through, and is diffuſed through the whole man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 23.</hi> when the Apoſtle there prayes for increaſe
of grace, he prayes <hi>they may be ſanctified wholly in body, ſoule and
ſpirit.</hi> And every new degree, though it begins at the ſpirit, the
underſtanding, yet goes through all: for ſo <hi>Epheſ. 4. 23, 24.
Be renewed in the ſpirit of your minds, and put on the new man:</hi>
it runs therefore through the whole man, having renewed the
mind. As the worke of grace at firſt, ſo after ſtill continually
<hi>leaveneth the whole lump.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether one Grace may not grow more then another?<note place="margin">Queſt. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> firſt, that it is certaine, that when a man grows up in
one grace, he doth grow in all; they grow and thrive toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Therefore in <hi>Epheſ. 4. 15. we are ſaid to grow up into him
[in all things.]</hi> Growth from Chriſt is generall, as true growth
in the body is in every part, ſo this in every grace. Therefore
2 <hi>Cor. 3. ult.</hi> we are ſaid to <hi>be changed into the ſame image from
glory to glory.</hi> Every increaſe ſtamps a farther degree of the
whole Image of Chriſt upon the heart. So the Theſſalonians,
<hi>Their faith and their love did both overflow, 2 Theſ. 1. 3.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet ſecondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> ſo as one grace may grow more then ſome
other.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe ſome are more radicall graces, as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi>
therefore of the Theſſalonians Faith the Apoſtle ſayes, 2. <hi>Theſ.
1. 3.</hi> that it <hi>did grow exceedingly;</hi> and then it follows, their <hi>love
did overflow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:56064:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. Some grace are more exerciſed, and if ſo, they abound
more; as though both armes doe grow, yet that which a man
uſeth is the ſtronger and the bigger, ſo is it in graces; In birds,
their wings which have beene uſed moſt, are ſweeteſt to the taſte.
As in the body, though the exerciſe of one member maketh the
body generally more healthfull, yet ſo as that member which is
exerciſed, will be freeſt from humours it ſelfe, ſo it is here;
ſo <hi>tribulation worketh patience, patience experience, Rom. 5.</hi> Many
ſufferings make patience the leſſe difficult, and much experience,
many experiments make hope greater.</p>
               <p>Againe, thirdly, that ſome graces are more in ſome then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
appeares hence; for what is it makes the differing gifts
that are in Chriſtians, but a ſeverall conſtitution of graces, though
all have every grace in them? as now in the body every member
hath all ſingular parts in it, as fleſh, bones, ſinews, veynes, bloud,
ſpirits in it, but yet ſo, ſome members have more of fleſh, leſſe of
ſinews and veynes, &amp;c. whence ariſeth a ſeverall office in every
member, according as ſuch or ſuch ſimular parts doe more or
leſſe abound in a member; the hand, becauſe it hath more nerves
and joynts in it then another member, though leſſe fleſh, yet how
ſtrong is it, and fit for many offices? the foot is not ſo: So in
Chriſtians, by reaſon of the ſeverall conſtitution of graces, and
the temper of them more or leſſe, have they ſeverall offices in
the Church, and are fitted for ſeverall employments; ſome have
more love, and fit for offices of charity; ſome more knowledge,
and are fit to inſtruct; ſome more patience, and are fitter to
ſuffer; ſome for ſelf-denyall, and accordingly doe grow in theſe
more ſpecially.</p>
               <p>The third Queſtion is,<note place="margin">3. Queſt.</note> Whether this increaſe be onely by <hi>radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating</hi>
the ſame grace more, or by a new <hi>addition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that by adding a new degree of grace, as in making
candles, which is done by <hi>addition,</hi> when a candle is put anew
into the fat of boiled tallow, every time it is put in, it comes
out bigger, with a new addition; or as a cloth dipt in the die,
comes out upon every new dipping in with a deeper die. And
this is done by a new act of <hi>creation,</hi> put forth by God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when <hi>David</hi> being falne, prayed for increaſe of grace, he
ſayes, <hi>Create in me a new heart.</hi> And therefore <hi>Epheſ. 4. 24.</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:56064:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when the Apoſtle exhorts to further putting on the new man,
and ſpeaketh of growth, he adds, <hi>which is created;</hi> for every new
degree is created as well as the firſt infuſion, which ſhews the
difference between naturall growth and this: In naturall growth
there needs not a new creation, but an ordinary concurrence;
but it is not ſo in this, that God that begun the work, by the
ſame power perfects it: And therefore <hi>Epheſ. 1. 19.</hi> he prayes
that the beleeving Epheſians might <hi>ſee that power</hi> that continued
to <hi>worke in them,</hi> to be no leſſe then that which raiſed up Chriſt;
for though naturall life may with a naturall concurrence increaſe
it ſelfe, becauſe the <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> the terme from whence it
ſprings, is but from a leſſe degree of life to a greater: yet it is
otherwiſe in this life, and our growth in this is from a greater
degree of death, to a further degree of life: And therefore
<hi>Phil. 9.</hi> the Apoſtle calls growing in grace, a going on <hi>to attaine
the reſurrection from the dead:</hi> And therefore the ſame power
that raiſed up Chriſt, muſt goe along to work it. Hence alſo
every new degree of grace is called a new converſion; <hi>except ye
be converted,</hi> ſayes Chriſt to his Diſciples converted already; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſame power that wrought to converſion, goes ſtill to
this. And therefore it is ſaid that <hi>God gives the increaſe, 1 Cor.
3. 7.</hi> and it is called <hi>the increaſing of God, Coloſ. 2. 19.</hi> ſo <hi>Hoſ. 14.</hi>
ſhewing the ground why they grow ſo faſt; <hi>Thy fruit is found in
me,</hi> ſayes God, <hi>ver. 7.</hi> although this is to be added by way of
caution and difference, that therein God doth proportion his
influence to our endeavours, which in converſion at firſt he doth
not. Therefore we are ſaid to be <hi>fellow workers</hi> with him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be he that <hi>gives the increaſe, 1 Cor. 3. 6, 7, 8.</hi> the ſame
you have alſo, <hi>Rom. 8. We by the Spirit doe mortifie the deeds of the
fleſh.</hi> We, as co-workers with the Spirit.</p>
