            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN EXACT ACCOUNT OF The Elector of <hi>SAXONY's</hi> paſſing the <hi>RHINE,</hi> with His Army, defeating ſeveral of the <hi>FRENCH,</hi> and rendering himſelf Maſter of ſeveral ſtrong places Abandon'd by them: Together with the raiſing of the Blockade of <hi>Mountmeli an</hi> in <hi>SAVOY.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE laſt Mail from <hi>Holland</hi> Dated the 17th of <hi>July,</hi> has brought us the welcome News of His Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Saxonies</hi> paſſing the <hi>Rhine</hi> with the Army under His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. On the 26 and 27 of <hi>June;</hi> an Account of ſo great Importance and ſo little expected either by the Confederates or the Enemy, by reaſon of the great dificulty of the Enterprice, that it has as much rejoyced the Firſt, as it has ſtruck a terror amongſt the Latter. <hi>The particulars of this great Action is as fallows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the <hi>French</hi> that lay Intrencht on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine</hi> near <hi>Manheim,</hi> had for ſeverl days furiouſly plaied with their Cannon on this ſide of the River to hinder our Men to paſs it: His Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Saxony</hi> accompanied by the Electoral Prince His Son, the vel Marſhal <hi>Caprara</hi> and the General <hi>Schoning;</hi> went the 27 of <hi>June</hi> about One a Clock in the Morning towards the Bridge of the <hi>Neckar,</hi> to find out a paſſage over the <hi>Rhine;</hi> after they were a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ved about a League below <hi>Manheim,</hi> they found an Iſland near a Ferry called the <hi>Sandhofer-Ferry;</hi> His Electoral Highneſs immediately ſent ſome to take a view of it, and whereas it was obſerv'd that it was a very advantagious Poſt, and that near it there was ſtill remaining part of the Bridge the Enemy had demoliſh't; His Electoral Highneſs ordered inſtantly ſome Hundereds of men to paſs over in Boats and to take poſſeſſion of it, which before break of day was executed ſo ſecretly that the <hi>French,</hi> altho in a manner done in their ſight, had not the leaſt notice of it, ſtaying all the day following in the Fort only half a Mile diſtant from the ſaid Iſland.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> that had poſſeſſed themſelves of this Iſland were moſt put to the Sword. A Souldier of <hi>Oppau,</hi> called <hi>Chriſteffle Ruff,</hi> ſhot the French Sentenal like a Bird from a Tree, the reſt were driven into the River, and their Cannon Seized, ſome of them geting over; and informing of this News, thoſe that lay in the Fort on the other ſide of the River, they immediately abandon'd the ſaid Fort, the Foot retreating towards <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> and the Horſe towards <hi>Creutznak.</hi> And His Electoral Highneſs finding that he was like to have no oppoſition, immediatly ordered a conſiderable Body of Men to paſs the River, the Electoral Prince his Son was amongſt the firſt that paſt it; and in a little while 8000 of our Foot with two Regiments of Dragoons took Poſt on the other ſide of the River, under the Command of General <hi>Hederſdorf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great Detachment of the <hi>French,</hi> furiouſly attact our Men, endeavoring to drive them back to the other ſide of the River; but they were put to the flight, leaving many killed behind them. In the mean time our whole Army paſt the River, and they being joyned by 9000 of the Cercle of <hi>Franconia,</hi> and 10000 Men of the Cercle of <hi>Suabia;</hi> they will now enter immediately upon ſome conſiderable Action; And its thought His Electoral Highneſs has a deſign upon <hi>Landaw,</hi> a very conſiderable Fortreſs, which is ſaid to be very ill provided, and one of thoſe places out of which the <hi>French</hi> have Drawn moſt of their Garriſon to reinforce their Army.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> that are ſtill in the <hi>Pelatinate</hi> are in the greateſt terror in the world, they have abandon'd moſt of the Places they were in poſſeſſion of, amongſt which there is <hi>Worms</hi> and <hi>Newſtad,</hi> and all this in ſo great a haſt they were not able to burn them. They have alſo abandon'd the Caſtle of <hi>Leiningen</hi> which the Confederates have poſſeſſed themſelves of. We have made a great many Priſoners and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt them a conſiderable number of Officers. In <hi>Worms</hi> alone we have ſeiced four <hi>French</hi> Captains and a Quartermaſter.</p>
            <p>This glorious expedition as it advances in a great meaſure the intereſt of the Confederates, ſo indeed 'twill be of great advantage to his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> muſt needs call hack all the Regiments that Marſhal <hi>de Lorge</hi> has Order'd to march into <hi>Savoy,</hi> in caſe they will endeavour to make the leaſt reſiſtance. 'Tis ſaid to the Glory of his Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Saxony,</hi> that by this ſtrenuous Action he has gain'd no leſs honor than the great <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> did near <hi>Opruheim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis ſaid that an Expreſs has not only Confirm'd all this News, but has alſo inform'd the Court; that his Electoral Highneſs was actually beſiging <hi>Landaw,</hi> and that he had cut off 3000 men of the Rear of the French Army.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Savoy</hi> we have a full Confirmation of raiſing the Siege of <hi>Coni,</hi> and beſides, we are told, that the French have been forc'd to raiſe the Blockade of <hi>Montmelian,</hi> in ſuch a manner that it turns to their everlaſting ſhame. The Governor of <hi>Monemelian</hi> ſent a Trumpeter to the French commander of the Blockade, deſiring him to grant him a paſs port to pay his devotion to a Church out of the City, very famous amongſt the Roman Catholicks; The Commander readily granted it, but the Governor being ſenſible of the French faith, foreſaw very well they would break their word, and indeed the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was contriv'd to ſurprize them. After he had laid a Conſiderable Body of his men into an Ambuſh, he went out in a Proceſſion accompan'd by his Guards. The French, againſt their promiſe did not fail to fall upon him; but he retreating with his men, drew them into the ſame Ambuſh, and 600 of the French were kill'd upon the ſpot: Whereupon the French Commander found himſelf forc'd to raiſe the Blockade.</p>
