         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Committee of Estates of the Kingdome
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> understanding, that the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Houses of Parliament, were procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in a Treaty for peace, with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
did about the beginning of the last
Moneth, authorize Us to present Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to his Majesty, and particularly to deal with him, and
the honourable houses, for establishing the Covenant and
Presbyteriall Government, the Confession of faith, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory
for Worship, and Catechism: For preventing the
tolleration of Idolatry, Popery; Prelacy, Superstition,
Blasphemy, Haeresie, and Schisme; And for perfecting the
great work of Reformation and uniformity, according to
the Covenant: the substance whereof hath been formerly
communicated in a letter from the Committee of Estates
to both houses, and by one of our number, upon his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ar the Committee of <hi>Derby house,</hi> by order from the
houses of Parliament. But to our great greif we doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
That the distractions of this kingdome are, beyond
our expectation, grown exceeding high; That a force hath
been placed on the passages to the houses; which during
transactions of highest concernmens, hath imprisoned and
secluded a great number of Members of Parliament, and
given occasion to many others to withdraw, because they
find they cannot Act, as in a free Parliament; that appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
are made to you for proceeding against the King,
to take away his life, and for changing the fundamentall
Government of this kingdome; And strong endeavours
are used, to overturne the whole work of Reformation, to
cast off the Ministry, and introduce a toleration of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
and formes of Worship: and so in effect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50724:3"/>
the Cause, wherein both Nations have been engaged,
and frustrare all the ends of the solemne League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
which both kingdomes have sworne with uplifted
hands to Almighty God sinceerly, really, and constantly to
performe. The consideration of these things doth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
trouble us, and fill our hearts with feares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that, as
they are for the present matter of great provocation of the
wrath of God against us, dishonourable to his Name, and
a reproach to Religion; so, if persisted in: that they shall
greatly weaken and divide us amongst our selves, invite
forraigne Enemies against us: advance the popish interest,
loose <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in the end, prove destructive to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion, and to the peace and happinesse of those
kingdomes.</p>
            <p>In the year 1640. when these Kingdoms were oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
under the yoke and tyranny of the Prelats, who then
were far advanced in the design, to introduce popery; the
kingdom of <hi>Scotl.</hi> did joyn their Endeavours with this king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom,
to procure a free Parliament here, looking upon it, as
the chief mean by the blessing of God to give a check to the
designs of the Prelats, who were studying the chang of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
And to the interprises of evill Councellors about
the King, who were endeavouring to establish an Arbitrary
aud tiranicall Government, and afterward, when through
the power aud prevalency of papists, prelats, &amp; Malignants,
this kingdom was distressed: The kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> did
enter into a solemn League and Covenant, with this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For reformation and defence of Religion, the honour
and happinsse of the King, and the peace and safety of the
three kingdoms: And particularly for bringing the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of God therein, to the neerest conjunction and unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in Religion, Confession of Faith, form of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
Directory for worship, and Catechising, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation
of popery, prelacy, Superstition, Heresy, Schisme,
profanes. And what soever shall be found contrary to
found Doctrin for mutuall preservation of the rights and
priviledges of Parliaments, and liberties of the kingdoms;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50724:3"/>
for discovering of Incendiaries, Malignants, and evil Instru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments,
that hinder Reformation of Religion, divid the King
from his peopl or one of the kingdoms from another, or
make any faction or party among the people, contrary to
the Leagu and Covenant, that they may be brought to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
triall and punishment: for preserving peace and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt the kingdoms: And defending one another in
this Cause; and continuing therein all the dayes of our
lives, zealously and constantly, against all opposition; and
for promoting the same, according to our power, against all
Letts, and impediments whatsoever.</p>
            <p>In pursuance of the solemn League and Covenant,
both Houses of the Parliament have often declared, That
they will Establish the Reformation of Religion, Extirpate
Popery, and Prelacy: And suppresse Heresie, and Schism,
and that they will maintain the fundamentall Government
of this Kingdom by King, Lords, and Commons. And when
the Common Enemy being subdued, the Scottish Army
was to go out of this Kingdom in the beginning of the year
1647. And his Majesty by consent of both kingdoms, was
to come to <hi>Holdenby:</hi> The Houses of Parliament
did declare, both to the king, &amp; to the kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
That respect should be had to the safety and preservation
of his Majesties person, in the preservation and defence of
the true Religion, and liberties of the Kingdomes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Covenant. And when the King should be at
<hi>Holdenby,</hi> and the Scottish forces gone out of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
That they would joyne with the Kingdome of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> in imploying their best endeavours, to procure his
Majesties assent to the Propositions agreed on by both
kingdomes. And in case the King should not give his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
thereunto: that the Houses were resolved still to
maintaine the happy union already settled between the two
Kingdomes, according to the Covenant and Treaties. The
Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> did at the same also, publish a
Declaration of their intentions (whereof one Copy was
delivered to his Majesty, and another to the Houses of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50724:4"/>
Parliament) that in the interim (untill his Majesty should
give satisfaction to both Kingdomes, in the Propositions of
peace) there should be no harme, prejudice, injury, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
done to his Royall person: that there should be noe
change of Government, other then had been for the three
years preceding: And that his posterity should be no
wayes prejudiced, in their lawfell succession to the Crown
and Government of these Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>These being the engagements of both Kingdomes joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
together, and severally one to another, for the ends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
VVe hold it our duty to endeavour, That Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Religion be setled and established, as is before
expressed: And especially, that the toleration of Idolatry,
Popery, Blasphemy, Heresie, and Schisme, be prevented:
least we partake in other mens sinnes, and thereby being
in danger to receive of their plagues: That the Rights and
priviledges of Parliament may be preserved: that there
may be no change of the fundamentall government: And
that there be no harme, injury, or violence offered to his
Majesties person, the very thought whereof, the kingdome
of <hi>Scotl.</hi> hath alwayes abhorred, as may appear by all their
proceedings and Declarations: And the Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have upon severall occasions expressed, a detestation
thereof in their Declarations: Wherefore, we do expect
that there shall be no proceeding against his person; which
cannot but continue and encrease the great distractions of
these kingdomes, and involve us in many difficulties, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and confusions.</p>
            <p>But that by the free Councells of both houses of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of England, and wih the advice and consent of
the Parliament of Scotland (which is now sitting) such
course may be taken in relation to him, as may be for the
good &amp; happines of these Kingdoms; both having an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
interest therein,</p>

         </div>
         <div type="letter">
            <p>By our letter of the 6th of this instant, we represented
unto you; What endeavours have bin used for taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his Majestyes life; for change of the fundamentall
Government of this kingdom; And introducing a sinfull
and ungodly toleration, in matters of Religion; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we did express our sad thoughts and great fears of the
dangerous consequences that might follow thereupon.
And further: we did earnestly presse, That there might be
no proceeding against his Majesties person; which would
certainly continue the great distractions of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
and involve us into many evills, troubles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions:
But that, by the free Councels of both houses of
the Parliament of England, and with the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> such course might by
taken in relation to him as may be for the good and
happinesse of these kingdomes; both having an unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
and undenyable interest in his person as King of
both: which duely considered, we had reason to hope,
should have given a stop to all proceedings, against his
Maiesties person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50724:5"/>
But we understand; that after many of the Members of the
house of Commons have been imprisoned and secluded;
and also without and against the consent of the house of
Peers, by a single act of yours alone, power is given to
certaine persons of your own Number of the Army, and
others to proceed against his Maj. person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
he was brought upon Saturday last in the afternoon
before this new extraordinary Court. Wherefore we do
in the name of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for their vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
from false aspersions and calumnies declare, That
though they are not satisfyed with his Majesties concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the late Treaty at <hi>Newport</hi> in the Isle of <hi>VVright</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in the matters of Religion; And are resolved not
to crave his Majestyes restitution to his Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
satisfaction be given by him to his kingdoms. Yet they
do all unanimously, with one voice (not one Member ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
disclaim the least knowledg of, or accession to the
late proceedings of the Army here, against his Majesty;
And sincerely professe, that it will be a great greife unto
their hearts, and lye heavy upon their spirits, if they shall
see their trusting of his Majesties person, to the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
houses of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to be made use
of to his ruine; So farre contrary to the declared intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Kingdome of <hi>Scttland,</hi> and solemn professions
of the Kingdom of England. And to the end it may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to the world, how much they abhominate and detest
