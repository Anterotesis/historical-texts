         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Ensuing Answers were several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drawn up, soon after the several
Books and Pamphlets of <hi>Francis Bugg</hi>
(referred to) were Extant, but the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof delayed thus long.</p>
            <p>1. That we might see what more he
would bring forth, be being a Contentious
Scribler against us, that they might be all
Remarked, if he brought forth any more of
like Import.</p>
            <p>2. His other Books and Pamphlets pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
before these against us, were mostly
so fully Answer'd, and his Apostacy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and Abuses so fully and clearly Detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that his evil and fruitless Attempts
are of so little Credit with all Sober, Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Persons, that have viewed them, that
<pb facs="tcp:58916:3"/>
we thought our selves the less obliged to use
Expedition in the Publication of particular
Answers to each.</p>
            <p>3. We finding him not able to Clear
himself, from his many Lies, Slanders,
Absurdities and Contradictions Charged
upon him in our former Answers, nor to
make any Rational Replies, Answers or
Rejoinders thereunto, but rather to repeat
and impose his former Gross Abuses instead
of fair Proofs, that the less Credit they are
of, the less we are affected therewith, and
the less concerned to follow him with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Answers or Replies.</p>
            <p>And the Reasons why this present Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulation
is divulged, is,</p>
            <p>1. Because we have found no Redress
upon our Application and Complaints (of
his foul Abuses) to those of the Clergy,
whom he seems to Esteem and Affect, but
that they have rather Strengthened and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
him in his perverse Gainsaying,
and injurious Abuses and Misrepresentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> either by
their esteeming him an Eminent <hi>Convert,</hi>
or giving <hi>Certificates</hi> in Applause of his
Work against the said People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58916:3"/>
2. Because the said <hi>F. Bugg</hi> seems to
have that Esteem with some of the more
Envious Persons, even of the Clergy, that
his Vnjust and Confuted Authority is made
use of, and quoted against us, to Reproach
us, particularly in that most Virulent, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
and Persecuting Book, stiled, <hi>The
Snake in the Grass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Because he does not only boast and
flatter himself in the Commendation and
Encouragement of those his Ministers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
but also has most presumptuously
and unwarrantably <hi>proceeded to divulge
an Impeachment on behalf of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of</hi> England, against our Yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
also very imperiously (from his own
Arbitrary, Vsurped Authority) given out
divers <hi>Summons</hi> and <hi>Threats</hi> against
particular Persons of our Friends, who are
the King's Peaceable Subjects: And that
the Abominable Pride, Presumption and
Imperiousness of this Pretended <hi>Convert</hi>
may be the more obvious, I shall here insert
one of his late Summons's, sent in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to several Places and Persons named,
as followeth.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:58916:4"/>Now I shall not need to make any long
Remark upon this Summons, the Matter
bespeaks it self, and what Pride, Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
and Insolency it proceeded from in the
Man, thus to assume to himself a Power to
Issue out such a <hi>Mandatory</hi> and <hi>Menacing
Summons,</hi> to so many Persons in divers
Counties and Places, as <hi>London, Suffolk,
Norfolk, Norwich, Huntingtonshire,</hi>
(where the Persons summoned severally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side)
<hi>to bring forth G.</hi> W. or themselves,
to meet him <hi>within Twenty Miles of his

Peril, that is, of his <hi>heavier Hand</hi> upon
them</p>
            <p>See the Ambitions Presumption of this
Imperious Person; he can presume to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
Men in <hi>Behalf of the Commons of

and Menacing</hi> Summons in his own

them under his heavy Hand, being

any Parliamentary, or other Legal
Authority for such Impeachment, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb facs="tcp:58916:5"/>
or Threat. If <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and his
Abettors of the Clergy, had such occasions of
Advantage against any of us called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
which thus affects the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
tending to Infringe the Liberties
and Properties of the Subjects, I am apt to
think we should be rendred highly Obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Arbitrary, if not Guilty of High
Misdemeanour; but I leave that Matter
to the Impartial and Judicious to judge of;
as I owe him no Ill-will, I would not hurt
his Person, or render Evil for Evil, or
Revenge upon him. His Commanding the
Persons Summon'd to bring forth <hi>G. W.</hi>
to stand to his own Proposition mentioned,
is a meer empty, idle Boast, false and
groundless Crack and Vapour; he knows in
his own Conscience, and 'tis well known to
many in this City of <hi>London,</hi> how I follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and sought to have a Meeting and Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with him, at sundry places in this City,
in the Year 1693. 12th Month, to prove
and make good my said Proposition, but still
he shun'd it, he shifted and evaded Meeting
with me on that Account, <hi>as is more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
evinced in my Answer, Intituled, <hi>The
Counterfeit Convert,</hi> Preface. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

               <salute>Friend, William Smithies.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEcause of the Character and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thou hast, as a Person of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Moderation, and also of
thy Desire that I might signifie
my Mind to thee in Writing, I was the
more willing to give thee this following
<hi>Information and Advertisement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Occasion of our late Proposals and
Complaint to thy self, concerning <hi>F. Bugg,</hi>
was the Incouragement and Strength, which
we understand, he has taken from thee, and
some others of the Clergy, to Commit and
Persist in his intolerable Abuse and Scandal
of an Innocent People, commonly called
<hi>Quakers;</hi> and particularly by
his being Reputed <hi>thy Convert,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Some Reasons for this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement to <hi>W. Smithies.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>as also by thy Privity to, and
Connivance at his Reviling and
Scandalous Pamphlets and Books
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58916:7"/>
against us as a People,</hi> and by thy promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Reprinting</hi> his Injurious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
with the New Title of <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Quakers Answer:</hi> Which (with
another Title) he had before delivered
to the Members of Parliament, to render
us both Odious and Obnoxious in the Eye
of the Civil Government; and Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Invalid the Condition of our present
Liberty, and to make void our Liberty it
self; which, as it bespeaks great Malice and
Persecution in him, so no great Charity nor
Prudence in thy self, either directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly,
to give Encouragement or Strength
to such a Counterfeit Convert, whose work
is not only purely Malicious and Revengful,
but Injurious to the Christian and Civil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of others, if he were but a Person
of Credit or Reputation therein, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
is not, with the Sober and Judicious.</p>
            <p>We have pursued him, in a Christian Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
both with fair and moderate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
in Print; the Substance and Principle
Arguments whereof he has given the <hi>Go-by</hi>
unto, and instead of any fair or solid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
or Rejoynders, he has partially
and unjustly Raked up broken Passages, and
Pieces, and Words out of some particular
Deceased Friends Books, making his own
perverse Constructions thereupon to Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represent
our Principles, and Scandalize us
as a People, without any due Regard to, or
Representment of the Author's own Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58916:7"/>
or the Harmony or Concurrence
of their own, or others of our Friends Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
or Writings Demonstrating our
Principles, which no ingenious Man will
refuse Persons or People their own Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Harmony of their extant or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Testimonies, to make out their own
Principles.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we have not thus left the said
<hi>F. Bugg,</hi> but even since his last coming to
<hi>London,</hi> we have earnestly besought and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to have a sober and suitable Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him, for a fair Dispute and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
of matters, chiefly in Controversie
between him and us, and that before mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and disinterested Persons; and the
more, because he pretended over and over
that he accepted of my Printed Challenge
in the <hi>Quakers Vindication,</hi> p. 4. and that he
came 60 Miles to <hi>London</hi> to accept thereof,
and had waited for an Engagement on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Terms near Three Weeks; when he
himself knows (and others also) how he
has been since followed with Letters, Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
and fair Challenges in that Interim,
even time after time, for such a Meeting as
before; but he has, by his divers Dilatory,
partial and unequal Terms (as by Letters
made out to him, which he may shew thee
if he will, about referring the matters in
difference to the Decision of others, and
for Retraction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) not only protracted
and delayed time, but at length, after he was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58916:8"/>
Argued out of his partial and various
Terms, and after induced to grant, <hi>viz.</hi>
If <hi>before Disinterested</hi> Persons, then <hi>no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,</hi>
which he concluded answered my
said Challenge.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this, a Meeting hereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appointed by some of the Persons Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized
by him, as Perjured and Pillored in
his <hi>New</hi> Rome <hi>Arraigned,</hi> of which he had
sufficient notice afore-hand, both of time
and place; and accordingly some of us met,
with divers Disinterested Persons for Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
nevertheless <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> came not
at the Meeting. He has a conceited boasting
insulting Humor and Clamorous, Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at a Distance; but when he is closely
put to it, and pursued for a Trial, and strict
Examination of his Clamours, Charges, and
Accusations, before Competent Wittnesses
and Disinterested Persons, he shamefully Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts
and timorously Shrinks, as in this case
of Controversie which he has begun against
the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and which is as
plainly told himself since by Letter; and I
am perswaded (with many more) that he
will bring no Honour to any of you of the
Clergy, or the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by these
his Malicious Attempts; and I wish thou
would'st prudently Consider it, both for
Truth's Sake, and thy own Reputation, to
put a stop to his Injurious Proceedings, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
and Printing against an Innocent Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whom he has shamefully Deserted and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58916:8"/>
(in his Self-Contradiction, and Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation)
wickedly Reproach'd and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed:
A few Instances whereof do here
follow.</p>
            <p>Some of <hi>Francis Bugg</hi>'s Principal Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and Misrepresentations of the People
commonly called <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. F Bugg <hi>charged us</hi> (i. e. <hi>at least
Twelve of us) as being</hi> A Pack of False
Witnesses, and Perjur'd Persons.</p>
            <p>And this from his own Scandalous Mock
Trial, Conviction, and Condemnation; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably
acted by him, in his <hi>New</hi> Rome
<hi>Arraigned,</hi> Epistle to Bereans, p. 7, 8, 9,
10, 11. and p. 33. And all this for our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Testimony against the matter of his
Charge, contained in the Four following
Articles of his false Accusations against
us, the said People, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That they (<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi>) deny
Jesus of <hi>Nazareth:</hi> See <hi>The Converted Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
p. 5.</p>
            <p>3. That they call <hi>Geo. Fox</hi>

of Righteousness,</hi> and put the
<hi>North</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for the

falsly saith, That they did not mean Christ,
but <hi>G. Fox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And that the Quakers Prophets give
witness to <hi>Geo. Fox, instead</hi> of this Christ,
p. 82. and Chap. 3. p. 16. they say, That
God Man, the <hi>Man Christ Jesus</hi> (who was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58916:9"/>
Born of the Virgin) was <hi>But</hi> a Garment,
a Vail, a Vessel, [which is expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to our Principles] as Answered in
Print: His <hi>Converted Quaker,</hi> p. 2.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>F. Bugg</hi> Accuses the <hi>Quakers</hi> with
<hi>Contempt of Scripture (i. e.</hi> the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
and (as intending) <hi>down with the
Holy Scripture,</hi> affirming that
<hi>they say, the Holy Scripture is
carnal Dust, Death, and Killeth;</hi>

in any of our Friends Books
quoted by him, and are sure
'tis contrary to our Principle,
as the foregoing are, yet <hi>Bugg</hi>
is not ashamed to say, <hi>viz. I
have not set down one Line or
Word as theirs, that is not
theirs, New</hi> Rome <hi>Arraigned,</hi>
p. 22.<note n="*" place="margin">Which is proved notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously False in our Answers in Print.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That these Precedent Accusations
are, not only expresly contrary to our
Principles, and Concurrent Testimonies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in Print both for Jesus Christ, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture and Divine Authority thereof,
but also to <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s own Testimony, in his
Book <hi>Of Christian Liberty,</hi> the Second Part,
Chap. <hi>1st.</hi> 
               <q>Where he confesseth our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
Received in the beginning, to be
Principles of Truth; and, in our Name and
Person, Testifieth unto the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that they are good, and a true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of those things which were most
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58916:9"/>
surely believed by the Apostles, and by
us ought to be believed [thus far <hi>F. Bugg,</hi>

when a kind of a <hi>Quaker.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Besides his Contradiction herein to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he Confesseth that here we agree (<hi>i. e.
G. Whitehead</hi> and himself) namely, What
the Holy Scripture is, That we do not
Ascribe Holiness to the Paper and Ink, or
Dead Characters, but to the Holy Doctrine
and Blessed Precepts therein contained,
which therefore is called the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>New Rome Arraigned, Apol. Intro.</hi>
p. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Where then can he Prove, either
that the <hi>Quakers</hi> Condemn the Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Blessed Precepts; or <hi>Say,</hi> that
the Holy Scripture is <hi>Dust, Death, &amp;c.</hi>
We Challenge him, or any of you, his Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,

Malicious, unjustly to render us Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious

Interest, by thus Magnifying of it, and to

Legally to Recognize us as <hi>Desenting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</hi>

(and Legally made it a Condition of our

you to be so Deceitful, to give in a Testimony
so contrary to your Belief:</hi> And that the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers

and Audacious Attempt is this? Dost thou
approve or disallow hereof?</p>
            <p>

to know of thee, If thou wilt please
to give a Check to him, and put a Stop to
his defaming the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> in
Print, or if he refuseth thy Advice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
If thou wilt give publick Testimony
against him, by disowning his perverse
Work, and tell the World he is Heady and
Wilful, and no real Convert, If neither
it will Reflect upon thee. Note, <hi>But to
this Enquiry or Letter, I never received An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
from</hi> William Smithies as yet. I Hear
he is again Printing against us (supposed
as one <hi>Bent</hi> in his Malice to Scandalize us)
which we resolve, with God's Help, not
not to lye under; for we are assured, he
has wickedly Wronged and Misrepresented
our Christian Religion and Principles, and
Shamefully and Undeservedly Scandalized
particular Persons, both Living and Dead,
and an Innocent People also; As we hope
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58916:11"/>
in Christ ever to approve our selves, both
in in the sight of God and Men, with due
Honour to Jesus Christ in all his Works and
Sufferings, and tender Respect to the Holy
Scriptures: As by the Harmony and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of our Ancient Friends Testimon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies
is publickly Demonstrated, and we
can make appear contrary to thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
Unjust Pretences and Misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
and therefore if thou dost not
put a stop to his Mischevious Attempts,
which severely Affects both our Christian
and Civil Reputations, in Rendring us both
<hi>Blasphemous Imposters, and Perjured Persons;</hi>
his Malicious Mischievous Work, will Affect
thee, and some others, who have Abetted
him, and the Cry will be loud, and ascend
higher than to thy self: I hope thou wilt
Charitably accept this <hi>Information</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement,</hi>
and prudently Consider, and
make Use of the same.</p>

                  <p>I Desire thee Charitably to accept these
Lines, and prudently to Consider them,
for the Truth's Sake, as also for thy own
Reputation. I remembering how Officious
thou wast, in Accompanying and Abetting
thy Follower and Disciple <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> in the
publick Disturbance he made of our Friends-Meeting
at <hi>Milden-Hall,</hi> the <hi>30th</hi> of the
<hi>2d</hi> Month, called <hi>April,</hi> 1691. Contrary to
the Intent of the present Government, and
of the Law of our Liberty in the peaceable
Exercise of our Religious Worship toward
Almighty God; and how thou, with him,
then Deemed our said Meeting an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Conventicle (because our Friends there
had omitted a Circumstance of Law, in not
entring that Meeting-House upon Record,
as the Law directs) which did not bespeak
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58916:12"/>
a Charitable Disposition on thy part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us: And also how thou hast Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Encouraged and Abetted the said <hi>F. Bugg</hi>
(if he writes true of thee) by giving thy
<hi>Approbation</hi> for his Abusive Book, Which
(he saith) he hath recited only an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof (in his most Scandalous Book,
Stiled, <hi>New</hi> Rome <hi>Arraigned</hi>) as followeth,
<hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>I do own the Substance of this Book,
as a <hi>Defence</hi> of those Eternal Truths, by
which, I hope for Salvation, and which
are as a Comfort to me in my Pilgrimage;
Peace be to those that own them; and
the Lord open the Eyes of them that deny
them, <hi>Isaac Archer.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, thou having thus far Countenanced
<hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and approved of his Writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, as a People (who are commonly
called <hi>Quakers</hi>) Please to Consider how far
his Injurious Work of Envy and Contention
against us; and the Consequences of it may
Affect thy Self and thy <hi>Reputation.</hi> And
therefore, for thy <hi>Information</hi> and <hi>Caution,</hi>
I hereby give thee a short Recital of some
of <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Notoriously False Charges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the said People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi>
where he chargeth them,</p>
                  <p>1. With denying Jesus of <hi>Nazareth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Contempt of Holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>3. Calling us Perjured Persons for our
Negative Testimony against his so charging
us; and thereupon acting his Mock Trial,
forging our Answers, and Erecting the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58916:13"/>
form of a Pillory, and therein Scandalizing
divers Citizens and Tradesmen in and about
<hi>London,</hi> as Perjured Persons (tho' Persons
of good Repute and Credit, better than
himself) thereby Affecting not only their
Christian, but Civil Reputations.</p>
                  <p>4. Contempt of Governours, and being
against Magistracy in Principles, he also
Charges upon the said People, giving
them these Characters, <hi>viz. New</hi> Rome,
Rome'<hi>s Sister,</hi> the <hi>Papists</hi> their <hi>Brethren, and
that they follow the Steps of the Jesuits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Terming one of their approved Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
<hi>one of her chief Cardinals</hi> (i. e. New
<hi>Rome</hi>'s.)</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Our Declaration to the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
for the Holy Scriptures being given by
Divine Inspiration, he renders Deceitful and
Contrary to our Belief, and to serve a Turn.</p>
                  <p>7. He Accuses the said People, with revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Christ's Ministers,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Added</hi> and Contemning <hi>his</hi> Magistrates.</note> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
Christ's Death &amp; Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
[all which is expresly
contrary to the said People's
Faith and Principles.]</p>
                  <p>8. Terming the said people, <hi>Black-Guard
of Lyers, Impudent Imposters, Cowards, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Blasphemers, Wretched Imposters, and
such as</hi> Simon Magus <hi>never exceeded, cum
multis aliis,</hi> &amp;c. With many more such like
gross Calumnies and Raileries are <hi>Bugg</hi>'s
Malicious Books stuft with; all to render
us Odious and Obnoxious in the Eye of the
Government and Nation, for which the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58916:13"/>
Righteous God will Judge him and his Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
for such his Intolerable and Mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Attempts.</p>
                  <p>Please to observe, that tho' <hi>F. Bugg</hi> by
his <hi>Partial Picking Words</hi> and Broken Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
out of some Ancient Books of <hi>George
Fox, Edward Burrough</hi>'s and <hi>Isaac Penington</hi>'s,
he would seem thereby to Colour such his
false and erroneous Charges before cited,
and Fallaciously cast them on a whole Body
of People; yet the same Books of theirs in
other <hi>Passages</hi> explanatory and more plain,
do clear them and their Principles, as to
their sincerely owning Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi>
highly Esteeming the Holy Scriptures, truly
owning Magistracy; and so far from Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as that they were in their Day true Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
against it, and against all Idolatry and
Superstition, and that our Declaration to
the King and Parliament, for <hi>the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
being given by Divine Inspiration,</hi> was
sincere on our parts; and, in the sight of God,
according to our Belief and Principle, as
by many of our Books and Testimonies is
Evinced; as also that we highly Esteem and
Value Christ's Death, Sufferings, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for the Reconciliation of Mankind unto
God; as by the Harmony and Concurrence
of our publick Testimonies and solemn
<hi>Confessions</hi>(which have been Extant for
many Years) is clearly and fully Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
<note place="margin">☜</note> whatever <hi>F. Bugg</hi> and his Abettors
have Maliciously Suggested to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58916:14"/>
against us, whose work of deadly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and Persecution therein does not only
affect our <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Reputation,
but the Civil Government, under which we
Live (and with true Gratitude) enjoy our
present Liberty in the Exercise of our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Consciences towards Almighty God, in
point of Worship: For,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Rendering our said Declaration
to the King and Parliament (for the Divine
Authority of the Holy Scripture) <hi>deceitful
on our parts.</hi> This is to go about to Invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
and Destroy a Principal Condition of
our Present Liberty, and to confront the
Government's acceptance of our said De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Unjustly and Maliciously Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
the said People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi>
under these Black and Odious Characters,
of <hi>New</hi> Rome, Rome'<hi>s Sister, and as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to the Papists, following the Steps of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,</hi>
&amp;c. And Consequently no better nor
other than <hi>Papists.</hi> Whereupon I ask thee
these Questions, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Does not this greatly tend to gratifie
the Popish Interest (by his thus Magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, far bigger than 'tis) and to lessen
and injure the Protestant Interest, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to Contradict the Government,
which has been pleased Legally to Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
us as Dissenting Protestants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 2. What Ingenuity, Honesty, or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
hath <hi>Bugg,</hi> or you his Abettors, shewn
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58916:14"/>
in thus Representing such a Body of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Subjects, as being <hi>Papists?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 3. What Regard or Respect to the
present Government have you therein Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 4. What <hi>Care</hi> of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
or Interest therein, has appeared on
your parts?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 5. And what Reputation, Credit, or
Honour to thee will thy Approbation of
<hi>Bugg</hi>'s writing against us be; when further
Exposed, to be taken Cognizance of by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
under higher Circumstances than thy
self, or thy Agent?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 6. Whether <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Contradicting the
Government's Recognizing us by Law, as
<hi>Dissenting Protestants,</hi> by his defaming us as
<hi>Papists,</hi> &amp;c. be not <hi>Seditious</hi> in the Nature
and Tendency thereof, as tending to stir
up Strife and Variance amongst Protestant
Subjects, and consequently to divide and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Interest of both King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 7. Concerning <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Assuming a
Power as a Judge, and in his own Name to
Try, Examine, Sentence, and Condemn Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
and Tradesmen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Perjured Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to the Pillory;</hi> and that in their Absence
too, and some of them Persons he never
knew; and, in his Mock Tryal, Forging,
false Answers in the same Persons Names,
and then Erecting the Form of a Pillory,
with Twelve Effigies in it to Ridecule the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58916:15"/>
Persons thus Condemned and Scandalized
by him, and the word [<hi>Perjury</hi>] set over
them in the Middle.</p>
                  <p>Now we Query of thee, and others his
Approvers, whether such his Proceeding be
Warrantable, either by the Law of God or
Man?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 8. Whether it will be for the Honour
of your Church and Clergy, for thy self or
any of you, to Encourage such a Malicious
Agent in his Scribling for you, to abuse an
Innocent People?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 9. And seeing <hi>F. Bugg</hi> has thy Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation?
I ask thee, If thou Approvest of
this his Doctrine, <hi>viz. It was not Jesus
Christ for whom the Body was Prepared, Is was
not Jesus Christ that came in the Flesh;
but the Word? New</hi> Rome <hi>Arraigned, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol.
Introduction,</hi> p. 3.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not unknown to many Witnesses
here, how earnestly and fairly I have En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured,
and made divers Overtures for
a Meeting in this City with <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> with
others of my Friends (whom he hath Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
with his Pillory, as aforesaid, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
Persons) even since his last coming to
<hi>London,</hi> and that before a few Disinterested
Persons, and we followed him with divers
Letters and Challenges for a Dispute, and for
Satisfaction for the Injury he has done us
by notorious Scandal and Defamation; and
the more, because he pretended <hi>he came 60
Miles to</hi> London <hi>to accept of my Printed Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58916:15"/>
amd had waited for an Engagement</hi>
(as he alledged) <hi>near
Three Weeks,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quakers Viu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, p. 4.</note> Yet for all
this, when closely put to it, he shifted and
protracted time, with his Variety of Dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Terms, one while to refer Matters in
Controversie to Ministers of Different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
to be left to their Decission, which
was to Impose an Implicit Faith upon us,
by giving away our own aforehand; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
while he was for Preingaging us to
Subscriptions. For Conditional Retractions
(which shewed his Impertinent Triffling)
another while, for meeting and debating
Matters before Disinterested Persons, which
last we did not Refuse, but endeavoured to
fix him thereupon and gave him Liberty to
choose Three or Four Persons to be his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates,
who he pleased, and we Appointed
a convenient time and place in <hi>London</hi> for
such a Meeting, and gave him Challenge,
and two Days Notice thereof aforehand,
where divers of us, with several Disinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
Persons for Witnesses, met and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
several Hours: Yet <hi>F. Bugg</hi> came not,
for all his Boasting aforehand, so that his
shameful Shifting and Evasion, both then,
and before, was Notorious; and we expect
no fair Dealing, Satisfaction or Right from
him, but Malicious Scribling, which, we are
Satisfied, no Ingenious Impartial Men will
give Credit to; however I thought meet to
give thee notice of his Malicious Work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:58916:16"/>
1. Because he is one of thy Flock.</p>
                  <p>2. Because thou hast Apparently Abetted
him in his Persecuting and Disturbing our
Meeting at <hi>Milden-Hall,</hi> as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>3. Because thou hast given him thy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of his writing against us, of which
he has Recited an Abridgment in his most
Scandalons Book, <hi>New</hi> Rome <hi>Arraigned,
Epistle to Ber.</hi> p. 12. Being on the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of his Pillory.</p>
                  <p>4. Because <hi>F. Bugg</hi> pretends thou art not
alone in thy Approbation, but another Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> has also writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to him (<hi>i. e.</hi> in his Commendation) <hi>as
having done a most acceptable piece of Service
to his Country, in Vnvailing of the Falshoods,
Errors and Hypocrisies of the</hi> Quakers; and
withal saith, he hath divers other Letters
of the same Import, both from <hi>Conforming</hi>
and <hi>Nonconforming</hi> Ministers.</p>
                  <p>Now these are to acquaint thee, That
we knowing <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Gross Abuses and
Scandals are in their own Nature Intoller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and thou hast thus far concerned thy
self in his Approbation, and we can have
no reasonable Satisfaction from him. By
all our fair and reasonable Endeavours we
do not intend to lye under his foul Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
But I am persuaded, the Cry will be
yet louder, and the Complaint ascend high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
against him and his Abettors therein,
and am apt to think, it will affect thy self,
and not tend to thy Honour or Reputation,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58916:16"/>
if thou dost not put a speedy stop to his
Malicious Scribling and Printing against us,
or at least give publick Testimony (of thy
dislike) against him, if he refuse to desist,
when Admonished. Take this as my cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to thee; So I expect to hear from thee
whether thou will make use of thy Interest
and Endeavours to put a stop to his Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Proceedure, that we may not be further
Persecuted, Scandalized, and Rendred Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious

                  <p>THine, Dated <hi>March</hi> 19. 1693. I have
been so long prevented giving An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to, besides what I desired by reason of
other Concerns, thy Moderation therein I
take well.</p>
                  <p>The Confessions I mentioned, Relating to
our Christian Belief and Doctrine, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and of the same Import, which I cannot
therefore send thee, being mostly Bound up
with other Books, and hard to find by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and therefore send thee the Inclosed
containing our Confession to Jesus Christ and
the Holy Scriptures; about which thy
Friend <hi>F. Bugg</hi> has greatly Misrepresented
the People called <hi>Quakers. I Remember
thou Advised him against making use of his
Warrant after some Discourse, yet cannot whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
clear thee from taking part with him in this
Disturbing our Meeting in 1691. By thy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
the same as being Unlawful, thy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
his Book is Apparent.</hi> In that Part
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58916:17"/>
of the Certificate, <hi>he Recites, by owning the
Substance thereof as a Defence of Eternal Truths,</hi>
which Implies our Offence against the same,
according to his Misrepresentations; thou
wishest our Wrangling at an end, and that
thou couldest stop me too; I am wholly on
the Defensive Part for Truth, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
People against that Wrangler <hi>F.
Bugg.</hi> Stop him, and our Controversie
Ceaseth, seeing thou mayest Diswade him
from Writing against us; for his Writing
bitter Calumnies will not be any Credit
to thee, or others his Approvers or Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
'Tis true, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is the Name
of a Mediator, and so given to him upon
his Incarnation; howbeit as the Son of
God, who is both the Saviour and the
Anointed, was before; even before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was, and was the Spiritual Rock that
all <hi>Israel</hi> Drank of.</p>
                  <p>Thou Writes Moderately, in saying thou
Believest we mean the same thing, but my
Question was Chiefly to thee about <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s
Doctrine, <hi>viz. It was not Jesus Christ for
whom the Body was Prepared; It was not Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ that came in the Flesh.</hi> This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
not Consistent with the Apostles

thou may'st Disswade <hi>F. Bugg</hi> from

Insult and Boast of your Approbation.</p>
            <p>4. You being Previously so plainly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
of his Abuse, and not Reformed,
having been Encouraged by you, 'tis thought

Publickly Manifest who are his Approvers

            <p>Now, you may Remember how that, in my

his Notorious False Charges and Gross Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
against the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi>
some whereof I again Recite to you, as

            <p>1. He Chargeth them, <hi>With denying Jesus
of</hi> Nazareth.</p>
            <p>2. Contempt of Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Calling us Perjured Persons,</hi> for our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Testimony against his so Charging
us: And thereupon Forging his Mock-Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and Answers in our Names, with the Form
of a Pillory, and therein Scandalizing divers
Citizens and Tradesmen in and about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
as <hi>Perjured</hi> Persons (tho' Persons of
good Repute and Credit) thereby affecting,
not only their Christian, but Civil Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Contempt of Governors, and being against
Magistracy in Principles,</hi> he also Charges up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58916:19"/>
the said People; giving them these Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>New <hi>Rome, Rome</hi>'s Sister, the Papists
their Brethren, and Followers of the Step of
the Jesuits.</p>
            <p>5. Terming one of their Approved Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
<hi>her Chief Cardinal</hi> (i. e. <hi>New</hi>
Rome's.)</p>
            <p>6. Our Declaration to the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
for the Holy Scriptures being given
by Divine Inspiration, he Renders <hi>Deceitful
and Contrary to our Belief, and to serve a
Turn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. He Accuseth the said People, <hi>with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling
Christ's Ministers, and Contemning his
Magistrates, Vndervaluing Christ's Death and
Sufferings.</hi> [All which are Expresly contrary
to our Faith and Principles.]</p>
            <p>8. Terming us (the said People) <hi>Black

such as <hi>SIMON MAGVS never exceeded,
Cum multis aliis.</hi>

            <p>With many more such like Gross Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and Rayleries, which <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Malicious
Books are stuff'd withal, to Render us
Odious and Obnoxions in the Eye of the
Government and Nation; for which the
Righteous God will Judge him and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors,
for such his Intollerable and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieveous
Attempts.</p>
            <p>And as to our said <hi>DECLARATION</hi> to
the King and Parliament, <hi>For the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58916:20"/>
being given by Divine Inspiration,</hi> It
was, and is sincere on our parts, and in the
sight of God, according to our Belief and
Principle, as by many of our Books and
Publick Testimonies is clearly Evinced; as
also that we highly Esteem and Value
Christ's Death, Sufferings and Sacrifice for
the Reconciliation of Mankind unto God;
as by the Harmony and Concurrence of our
Publick Testimonies and Solemn Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is clearly and fully Demonstrated,
whatever <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and his Abettors have
Suggested to the Contrary against us.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Rendering our said De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
and Testimony (<hi>for the Divine
Authority of the Holy Scriptures) DECEIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FVL
on our Parts,</hi> New <hi>Rome</hi> Arraigned,
p. 40, and 42. This is to Endeavour to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate
and Destroy a' Principal Condition
of our present Liberty: And is it not to
Confront the Government's Acceptance of
our said Declaration also?</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Isaac Archer,</hi> thou mayest Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that, in my Letter to thee, upon <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s
Unjustly and Maliciously Representing the
said People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> under those
Black and Offensive Characters of <hi>New</hi>
Rome, Rome'<hi>s Sister, and</hi> as <hi>Brethren to the
Papists,</hi> &amp;c. Consequently no better nor
other than <hi>Papists,</hi> I asked thee these, with
some other Questions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Does not this greatly tend to Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the Popish Interest, and to Lessen and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58916:20"/>
Injure the Protestants, and Consequently
to Contradict the Government's Legally Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizing
us to be <hi>Dissenting Protestants?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What Ingenuity or Prudence hath
<hi>Bugg,</hi> or his Abettors shewn in thus Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
such a Body (of Protestant Subjects)
as being <hi>Papists?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. What Regard or Respect to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Government, or Care of the Protestant
Religion, have you (his Approvers) therein
Manifested on your Parts?</p>
            <p>4. And what Reputation, Credit or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to thee (<hi>Isaac Archer</hi>) will thy Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s thus Writing against us
be, when further Exposed to be taken Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Whether his Contradicting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment's
Recognizing us by Law as <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Protestants,</hi> by his Defaming us as
Papists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be not Seditious in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Tendency thereof, as tending to
sow and stir up Strife and Variance amongst
Protestant Subjects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Concerning <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Assuming a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
as a Judge, and in his own Name to Try,
Examine, Sentence, and Condemn Citizens
and Tradesmen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (who are the King's
Subjects) as <hi>Perjured Persons</hi> and to the <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory,</hi>
and that in their Absence too, and
some of them Persons he never knew,
as he has since declared, and in his Mock-Trial,
Forging False Answers in the same
Person's Names, and then Erecting the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58916:21"/>
Form of a Pillory, with Twelve Pictures,
and the first Letters of the Names of the
Persons (thus Condemned and Scandalized
by him) and the Word [<hi>Perjury</hi>] set over
them, to Ridecule them with such Gross
Forgery.</p>
            <p>Now we Query of you, his Approvers,
whether such his Proceedings be Warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
either by the Law of God or Man?</p>
            <p>With several more Queries and Matters
to thee (<hi>Isaac Archer</hi>) in my Letters Relating
to <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Abuse, and my large and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Letters also to the said <hi>W. Smithies,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
much in Substance of the same Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which yet remain unanswered by you,
or either of you, save only a few Lines I
had f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om thee <hi>Isaac Archer,</hi> which is not all
Answer to the Queries, neither does it yet
appear that you have given him any Real
or Effectual Check to stop his Abuse and
Calumnies, as you were Cautioned; but
rather he has persisted therein; and Boasts
of your <hi>Approbations</hi> as followeth.</p>
            <p>F. Bugg <hi>Proceeds (in his Preface) p. 3.
thus,</hi> viz. Poor Proud Man (i. e. <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head)</hi>
I say this Considered, I shall allow Mr.
<hi>Archer</hi> Room for his whole Approbation, and
Recite the Substance of two or three Letters from
some other Clergymen, and the Request of three
others, besides an Independant Preacher, that so
be <hi>(G. W.)</hi> may see that both Conforming
and Nonconforming Ministers are not ashamed
to appear in Favour of what I Write; nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58916:21"/>
of <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> who acts more like

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If you, his Approvers, are not
ashamed so to appear in his Favours, you
may be: I persume you have given your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations
too Early, before you could have
or see our Answers: And I Question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
either you Conforming, or Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Ministers (who have been so early in
your Approbations for <hi>F. Bugg</hi>) have ever
yet seriously Perused our Answers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futations
of his Notorious Lyes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
against us, but have rather brought
your selves under great Blemish and Guilt
by such your Approbations; and I must
tell you, it was a very Unadvised and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet
Act in you to be so Forward and
Early in your Approbations and Judgments
for <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Books against the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
without hearing both Parties Fully and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially;
such <hi>Percipitancy</hi> and <hi>Injustice</hi> will
never Redound to your Honour or Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who are the Clergymen and Ministers
(Conforming or Nonconforming) who have
shewn your Favours and Approbations of
this pretended Convert, for much Boasted

those two Clergymen, as before, to shew
them some of his foul abuses and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
that they might have Corrected or
Stopt him, if they would have been so just;
but instead thereof, concerning them of the

<hi>of your Thanks</hi> for his Labour: But what

               <p>
                  <hi>He now tells me,</hi> That neither did Col.
<hi>Goldwell</hi> ever Reprove him, but always Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of the Substance of what he wrote, and
approved of his delivering the Sheet to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,

               </p>
               <p>I am sure (with others) Col. <hi>Goldwell</hi>
told several of us the Contrary, namely,
<q>That when three of us shewed him the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<hi>Bugg</hi> had done him (<hi>i. e.</hi> by dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Scandalous Books to him, in hopes
of his Patronage) he, the said Col. <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
signified to us, that he was not made
privy to his Dedication, for he knew not
of it before it came forth, and had shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his dislike thereof,</q> as is more fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in my Answer, <hi>Innocency Triumphant,</hi>
p. 67, 68, 69, 70.</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>F. Bugg</hi> Contrarywise to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that Col. <hi>Goldwell did never reprove him
but always approved of the Substance of what
he Wrote,</hi> &amp;c. This is not only to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the said Col. in what he Possitively
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58916:26"/>
told <hi>William Mead, G. Latye,</hi> and my self;
but further, to add to his Disrepute and
Disparagement, as an Approver of such
Scandalous Pamphlets as those of <hi>Bugg</hi>'s,
particularly that of his <hi>New Rome Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
with his Gross and Scandalous Mock-Trial,
Sentence of <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Pillory</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
divers Persons of good Repute, both
Citizens and others; but whether Col.
<hi>Goldwell</hi> be to be Credited in his own Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his <hi>dislike, and severe advertisement</hi>
(as he told us) against what <hi>F. B.</hi> wrote;
or <hi>F. B.</hi> in saying, he <hi>never did reprove him,
but always approved thereof,</hi> I say, which of
them to Credit, in such Contradiction, the
Reader is left free to his own choice, as
may appear most probable to him, the one
being a Member of Parliament (whose Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
was the more concerned) and the
other proved an Envious, Self condemned,
<hi>Grievous Revolier and Blackslider,</hi> and <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Scribler,</hi> against an Innocent People,
after owned by him, and conversant among
them, for above 25 Years, <q>as <hi>the People of
God, and their Principle, Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,</hi>
as <hi>being a Dispensation of the Love of

Enjoyment of his Presence for many
Years</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Foxonian Quakers</hi>] is a scornful Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name,
and no such distinction own'd by the

               <p>His Charges of <hi>dangerous Errors, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Principles, tending to Overthrow the

to encourage</hi> MAHOMETISM, <hi>and to
pervert the right way of the Lord;</hi> are also
Perverse and Lying Aspersions and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which neither are, nor can be proved
by him, or you, his Abettors, against the
said People, on due Examination; besides
his dubious Question on his own Charge,
renders him the more uncertain and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
therein, by his thereupon saying,
viz. <hi>Which whether so or no, deserves the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
and Consideration of the Christian
Ministry of all Protestant Churches,</hi> so short
and dubious is he in his own Examination
and Consideration; tho' very loud, cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
and positive in his Charges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he does (it seems) but make work for
others, which he is never able to perform
himself, nor his Abettors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tending to Encourage Mahometism</hi>] is a
new, as well as undue Charge; what's his
pretended Reason or Proof for the same?
In his Preface to the Reader, p. 2.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:58916:27"/>
               <p>His supposing, <hi>That they do not believe
Christ to be distinct from the Saints, or from
his Body the Church,</hi> (which he is Head of)
herein is a mistake, yet this can be no proof
of his Charges, if by <hi>distinct from them,</hi> be
meant <hi>separate</hi> from them, as may be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
supposed; for Christ and his Saints,
as to their Beings, are distinct, and not
confounded, yet not divided nor separated
from each other in Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they do not Pray in the Name of Jesus
to God the Father, thereby to own his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torship</hi>]
is a notorious (and publickly
known) <hi>Lie,</hi> as Thousands can Testifie,
consequently far from proving his said
Charges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor make Confession of Sin to God in Prayer,
nor beg Pardon for the same</hi>] are also two
notorious Falshoods, knowing that many
who frequent our Meetings, have great need
of both sincere Confession, Repentance, and
Pardon of Sin, for Christ's sake, and their
own poor Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But look at Christ within, the Light within,
his Intercession within</hi>] and so did all true
Christian Believers, who knew the Mystery
of Christ in them, who believed and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Light, and received <hi>the Spirit of
the Son of God into their Hearts, making In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession,
and crying,</hi> Abba, <hi>Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do not believe this to be any perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Principle, either tending to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Christian Faith, or to Encourage
Mahometism.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:58916:27"/>
                  <hi>His Crucifixion within; is not this to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
that they do not believe Christ Crucified
without</hi>] which is a perverse and injurious
Falshood implied against them, having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
confessed Christ Crucified without on
the Cross at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as the Scripture te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies:
And if we should say, that <hi>F. Bugg,</hi>
and such envious Apostates, do Spiritually
Crucifie Christ afresh unto (and in) them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and put him to open shame, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously
Reproaching his Truth and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
this is not to deny his being Crucified
without. I cannot see any <hi>Mahometism</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The People called <hi>Quakers</hi> do
utterly deny <hi>Mahometism:</hi> 'Tis not at all
Concerned in their Principles or Religion,
being Christian and wholly Opposite to the
Adoration of that Impostor <hi>Mahomot.</hi> 2.
They utterly deny that Christs Religion
could be mended by <hi>Mahomet</hi> or any Man
or Men else whatsoever. 3. But if the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi>
hold <hi>Abrham</hi> to be the Friend of
God, and <hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>Messenger,</hi> and Christ
the <hi>Breath,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Power,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi>
and <hi>Strength</hi> of God, and <hi>Quakers</hi> hold the
same; this can no more prove that their
Principles and Doctrines tend to encourage
<hi>Mahometism,</hi> than that the Holy Apostles
Doctrine did so, for they held Christ to be
<hi>the Word of God,</hi> John 1. 1 John 5. 7. Rev.
19. <hi>The Power of God, and the Wisdom of
God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 24. Yea, <hi>The Life, Strength,
and Arm of God, and a Quickning Spirit also,</hi>
Isa. 53. 1 Cor. 15. Could this be to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<hi>Mahometism?</hi> No sure, 'Twere
Blasphemy to Assert it. The <hi>Mahometans</hi>
hold many Truths out of the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
corruptly mixt with their <hi>Mahometan</hi>
Imposture, and so do many Idolaters, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58916:28"/>
and Antichrists in <hi>Christendom;</hi> does
it follow, that because the <hi>Quakers</hi> own
those Truths, that therefore they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Mahometans,</hi> or <hi>Idolators,</hi> &amp;c. 2. That's
no good Consequence, and but ill Argued,
at this Rate <hi>F. Bugg</hi> may as well prove any
true Christian to be of any Religion; and
himself also a gross Impostor, because he
holds some Truths which gross Imposters,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> hold.</p>
               <p>Neither can he, <hi>Mahometize</hi> or Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
the <hi>Quakers</hi> by his False Supposition
<hi>viz. If they do not come to this Result to own
the same Jesus that was Born of the Virgin,
Crucified, Dead, Buried, Rose again, and in
the sight of the</hi> Galileans <hi>Ascended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
Seeing we do Sincerely, and Frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Publickly, own and confess the same
Jesus, both in Print and Publick Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
as Thousands are Witnesses, that we
Confess <hi>Jesus Christ come in the Flesh,</hi> Born
of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> that he was the <hi>Word</hi>
which took Flesh, and Christ also a Spirit,
even a <hi>Quickning</hi> Spirit, 1 John 1. 14.
1 Cor. 15. 45. But <hi>F. Bugg</hi> Falsly adds this
more Possitive Charge, <hi>viz. And Publickly
Condemn their Books, which Teach the Contrary,</hi>
Preface, p. 2.</p>
               <p>And what's contrary, but <hi>that the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<hi>disown the same Jesus that was Born of
the Virgin</hi> Mary; which is a Notorious
Falshood and Calumny. And therefore I
Challenge him, and you his Teachers, Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58916:29"/>
and Congratulators, to produce those
Books of the <hi>Quakers</hi> with the Pages and
Words wherein the <hi>same Jesus</hi> is so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned;
otherwise, for shame Retract and
Condemn this his Abuse and Calumnious
Aspersion.</p>
               <p>He further proceeds, in Justification of
his most gross Forgery and Defamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, <hi>viz. But they say I put up a Mock-Pillory;
I Grant I did, and that to shew what
they Actually deserved from their own Proposals
to Authority,</hi> Preface. p. 2.</p>
               <p>Which <hi>Mock-Pillory,</hi> was the form of a
Pillory, with Twelve Pictures standing
with the first Letters of the Names of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> and other Persons
of good Fame and Repute, with a Forged
Mock-Trial, grosly to Defame and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
them as <hi>Perjured Persons,</hi> (for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s False Charge) in the first
Edition of his <hi>New</hi> Rome <hi>Arraigned:</hi> And
now both his Mock-Trial and Mock-Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory
left out in his Second Edition: Yet
thus Unjustly Justified therein, as <hi>what the</hi>
Quakers <hi>Actually Deserved;</hi> Oh! Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Falshood, Insolence and Slander: But
what has he Actually Deserved: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
in Contradiction to this his False Plea,

<hi>Thomas Crisp,</hi> in his <hi>Counterfeit Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,</hi>
p. 2. saith (as he is informed) <hi>That</hi>
F. Bugg <hi>has acknowledged</hi> 10 G. Whitehead,
<hi>&amp;c. that he was sorry he had done it; and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58916:29"/>
that if it were to do again, he would not do it;</hi>
(that is, set up his Feigned or Mock-Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory.)
But how does his Sorrow for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
when now he tells us, <hi>'Twas to shew
what they</hi> (i. e. the Quakers) <hi>Actually De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served?</hi>
Where's then his Sorrow? What
say you his Watchers? Was it a just Course
to Convince us of Error that he took against
us by his <hi>Mock-Trial</hi> and Scandalous <hi>Mock-Pillory?</hi>
Pray Answer plainly; otherwise,
if you do not yet stop bis Current of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing
and Defaming us, your Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Approbations already given him,
will the more Affect you, and Render you
the more Culpable of his gross Abuses, as
partakers of his great Iniquity which will
be no good Expedient to dignifie your
Church, or promote your Interest or good
Fame; I hope you'll yet Consider it.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58916:30"/>
Bespatter him in City and Country, &amp;c.
This I have found true: Thus far F. <hi>Bugg.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Observe here this Piece of Forgery and
Romance to Bespatter us, and Suggest
False Matters against us, which he never
heard the <hi>Quakers</hi> say, but thinks he hears
them so say, which we cannot think he does,
unless he Dreams it. But to shew his own
Conceited Ambition and Pride, how Puft
up, Swell'd and Bigg he is in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
as if he were such a Potent Invincible
Antagonist, when we very well know the
Contrary how Feeble, Impertinent and
False he is: And his Comparing himself to
<hi>M. Luther,</hi> as one in his Steps, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>our Dear
Elder-Sister:</hi> In the one appears his Proud
Conceit, and Vain Fmpty Boasting; in the
other, his Notorious Falshood and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny.</p>
               <p>As to his Charge of <hi>Blasphemous Pretences
of Miracles</hi> against <hi>G. Fox,</hi> whom he most
Maliciously and Slanderously calls, <hi>That Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poster,</hi>
Pref. p. 6. And why so? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>G. Fox</hi> mentioned <hi>certain Miracles
Wrought by the Power of God:</hi> Not at all
Ascribing them to himself, or his own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but to the Power of God; in Answer
to the fervent Prayers of his Servants and
People among us in certain places. But,
says <hi>F. Bugg, not one of them (i. e.</hi> Miracles)
<hi>said to be done in the Name of Jesus of</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,
as in <hi>Acts 3. 6. Which</hi> (Quoth he)
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58916:30"/>
                  <hi>is a strong Argument of their Disowning Jesus
of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That Miracles, both outward
and inward, have been wrought among us
by the Power of God (Consequently by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ who is that Power) <hi>F. Bugg</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Confute.</p>
               <p>If wrought by the Power of God, then
they must be in the Name of Jesus Christ,
for they are Indivisible and Inseparable.</p>
               <p>3. What Sincere and Faithful Regard
and Breathings of Soul, those our Friends
Concerned, had in their servent Prayers to
the Name of the same Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,
F. Bugg</hi> is now as wholly Ignorant and now
Insensible as his Argument and Consequence
(<hi>of their Disowning Jesus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
is utterly False; it being by and through
<hi>him</hi> that the Power and Spirit of God hath
been made known among us, in its Effectual
Operations.</p>
               <p>As to his Reciting the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books,
which he Falsly says carry two <hi>Contrary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Contrary Doctrines, Contrary Principles,</hi>
&amp;c. In two Columns Opposite. And then
Aspersing their Leaders with the <hi>Depth of
Hypocrsy Couch'd in them.</hi> 'Tis to none
but to such as his own Evil, Envious Eye,
his Dim and False sight that they appear
so Contrary; for to a Single Eye and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Mind such Pretended or seeming
Contrariety is <hi>easily Reconcileable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

As under the Title of <hi>The Perfect Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
he Cites, David <hi>'s Enemies Discovered,</hi>
p. 7. Thus, <hi>viz. And these (the</hi> Quakers)
<hi>do not call the Letter the Rule, nor</hi> Matthew,
Mark, Luke, <hi>and</hi> John <hi>the New Testament
and Gospel,</hi> &amp;c. And in Opposition, under
the Title of <hi>The Counterfeit Quaker,</hi> he
Cites, <hi>The Harmony of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
and the fulfilling of the Prophecies:</hi>
But he has falsly Cited the first to make
them seem the more Contradictory for the
Words truly Cited, are these, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>And
these (<hi>i. e.</hi> Who witness the Life which
spoke forth Scripture) do not call the
Letter the Rule, <hi>and the four Books, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,
Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the New
Testament and Gospel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Here <hi>Bugg</hi>
leaves out [<hi>and the four Books</hi>] which he
has not Proved to be, both the <hi>New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the Gospel,</hi> being not the <hi>Books</hi>
Abstractly, but the New Covenant, and
the Power of God therein Testified unto,
which Gospel was before the Books were,
and before <hi>Abraham</hi> was: Rom. 1. Heb. 8.
Jer. 31.</p>
               <p>Besides we owning the said four Books,
to be Books of the New Testament or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
yet they are not all the Books
thereof, there are more Books of the New
Testament, as that of the Blessed <hi>Acts of the
Apostles,</hi> and their Evangelical Epistles, and
the Excellent Apocalips, which also belong
to the New Testament; so that the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58916:31"/>
of the Old and New Testament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to the Divine Testimonies or Doctrine
of Christ contained in the Books: <hi>Paul</hi> and
other Apostles were Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
not of the Letter, but of the Spirit;
and of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> or <hi>New Covenant</hi>
(which are one and the same) yet did
not thereby <hi>Contemn</hi> or Slight the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which Testifie thereof. And seeing
that I have Confessed that the <hi>Spirit or Life
of Christ gave forth the Holy Scriptures,</hi> far
be it from me to have the least Undervaluing
Thoughts or Disesteem of the Scripture,
which proceeded from thence: Therefore
<hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Observation against the Quakers
Doctrine (and against me in Particular)
in this matter, as <hi>nothing but Discord and
Confusion,</hi> and setting the <hi>perfect Quaker</hi> in
Opposition to the <hi>Harmony of the Old and
New Testament;</hi> and Terming those that
own <hi>that Harmony</hi> (as <hi>J. Tompkins</hi> and <hi>W.
Penn</hi>) but <hi>The Counterfeit Quakers:</hi> Both
which are so Notoriously False and Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
that we could Enumerate Testimonies
against him herein.</p>
               <p>Again, 'tis as General as Positive a Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>Doctrine attributes
that to</hi> G. Fox, <hi>which is</hi> ONLY <hi>due to Christ,</hi>
Apol. p. 4. For the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>
do positively disown any such Doctrine as
doth attribute that to any other Man which
is only proper and due to Jesus Christ, and
sincerely Confess that Christ in all things
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58916:32"/>
must have the Preheminence in Glory and
Dignity, as the <hi>only Potentate King of Kings,
and Lord of Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Charge against the <hi>Perfect Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
(as he calls him) is from the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Trial of <hi>G. Fox</hi> at <hi>Lancaster</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>size;
being thus Cited, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>And before
I came to the Barr I was moved to Pray,
that the Lord would Confound their
Wickedness and Envy, [And what Crime
was that?] The Thundred Voice An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>I have Glorified thee, and will Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
thee again.</hi> And I was so filled <hi>full of
Glory,</hi> &amp;c.</q> In Opposition <hi>F. Bugg</hi> sets <hi>John</hi>
12. 28, 29. And 'twas <hi>F. Bugg's</hi> Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
hereupon: But, <hi>Reader, here is</hi> G.
Fox' <hi>s Manifest</hi> BLASPHEMY <hi>in Assuming
a Glorified State, whilst in the Mortal Body,</hi>
p. 4.</p>
               <p>But is not here rather <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s great
Envy, Darkness and Ignorance apparent?
For tho' <hi>G. Fox</hi> Assumed not such a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
State in that fulness in the Mortal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
here, as will be in the Immortal here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
yet some Degree of Glory he might
witness, as the true Sufferers for Christ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of here in this Life: Observe, <hi>If ye
be Reproached for the Name of Christ, happy
are ye, for the Spirit of Glory and of God rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon you,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 14. See also Chap.
1. 8. And were not they Changed <hi>in the
same Heavenly Image from Glory to Glory, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as by the Spirit of the Lord:</hi> See 2 Cor.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58916:32"/>
3. 18. And see also <hi>John</hi> 17. 22. Christ said,
<hi>The Glory which thou gavest me, I have given
them.</hi> Therefore 'tis no Blasphemy to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
and Testifie thereof. And how far
that Reproached Servant of Christ did Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
thereof in his Sufferings (who is now
unjustly Rendred a <hi>Blasphemer</hi>) is wholly
hid from this Blind persecuting Adversary,
who deems that <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> which is so much
agreeable to Holy Scripture Testimony.</p>
               <p>Again, our Suffering Friend <hi>G. Fox</hi> Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
<hi>That he was come up in the Spirit, through
the Flaming Sword, into the Paradise of God,
and that he was in Paradise,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Against this, our Adversary thinks he has
gotten huge Advantage; he Roars and Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
out, <hi>viz. Thus did he Magnifie himself
equal with, or above Christ. Oh! Horrible,</hi>
&amp;c. (Quoth he.) But soft, stop a little;
Is there no such Paradisical State in Christ
attainable in this Life, but it must be deemed
<hi>Horrible and Blasphemous,</hi> as our bitter Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
doth? May we not Cry out against
his Gross Darkness, and his Teachers Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.
<hi>Oh Horrible!</hi> Did <hi>Paul</hi> Blaspheme
or Magnifie himself, as equal with, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Christ; when, coming to Visions and
Revelations of the Lord, he declared, <hi>That
he knew a Man in Christ above Fourteen Years
ago, how that he was Caught up into Paradise,
and heard Unspeakable Words, &amp;c.</hi> See the
Matter more at Large, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3,
4. See also <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7. Therefore 'tis not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58916:33"/>
a Self Magnifying nor Erroneous really to
Believe and Profess a State of Paradise, or
Heaven in Christ Jesus (in some degree)
attainable, even in this Life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
               <p>Our Reproached Friend's declaring that
he was <hi>Cloathed with Righteousness, and whose
Name is not known in the World, Risen up out
of the</hi> North, <hi>which was Prophecied of, but
now fulfilled,</hi> &amp;c. These Words our angry
Adversary sets in Opposition to <hi>Moses</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of Christ, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 15. and <hi>Acts</hi>
3. 22. and to <hi>John</hi> 1. 10. Whereupon he
makes this Observation, <hi>viz. Thus did</hi> G.
Fox <hi>Vye with Christ,</hi> p. 5. But I do not Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
any such <hi>Vying</hi> or <hi>Equalizing</hi> with
Christ; nor Contradiction to the Scripture
Testimony or Prophecy of him: For, <hi>1st.</hi>
To be Cloathed with Righteousness, is
Christ's Redeemed Ones (the true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers)
Priviledge and Happiness. <hi>2d. The
Nature not known to the World,</hi> was meant
the <hi>New Name,</hi> pertaining to the <hi>New Birth.

of</hi> [Which] here is Relation to the

the Prophecy was of the <hi>Seed</hi> which, was
foretold, the Lord would gather, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
bring forth out of the <hi>North</hi> Countrey,
and all Nations where Scattered: See <hi>Isa.</hi>
43. 6. and 49. 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 16. 15. and 23.
8. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Observation, p. 5. <hi>viz. Thus, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
did</hi> G. Fox <hi>Vye wish Christ, and</hi> Edward
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58916:33"/>
Burroughs <hi>and</hi> Francis Howgil <hi>two of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Echoed back in their Epistle, Entituled,</hi>
This is only to go amongst Friends, <hi>viz.
Thou, O North of</hi> England, <hi>who art counted as
Desolate and Barren,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet out of thee did
the Branch (i. e.</hi> G. Fox) <hi>Spring and the Star
Arise,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Parenthesis (i. e. <hi>G. Fox</hi>)
in that Place, is a Notorious Forgery, as well
as Malicious.</p>
               <p>2. Here's no Person Vying or Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
himself with Christ.</p>
               <p>Nor Echoing back to any such <hi>Vying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Tho' our bitter Adversary has often
Repeated this Citation, and now grosly
wrests it by Forgery, to prove his False and
Malicious Charge against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> viz
<hi>That the Quakers Prophets give witness to</hi> G.
Fox INSTEAD <hi>of Christ; that they call him
the Branch, the Star, the Son of Righteousness,
and put the North of</hi> England <hi>for the Town
of</hi> Bethlehem. Yet there's no mention at
all made either of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> or Town of
<hi>Bethlehem,</hi> in all that Epistle of <hi>E. B's,</hi>
Quoted, as the Epistle may be seen at large
in his <hi>Works,</hi> p. 64, 65, 66, 67.</p>
               <p>And Note, that General Epistle of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Howgil</hi>'s, <hi>To the Camp of the Lord in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherein are the Words, <hi>Spare
none, neither Ox nor Ass,</hi> &amp;c. Is Printed in
his <hi>Works,</hi> Pages 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33.
Which I have also viewed over, and find
not any such Title; as, <hi>This is only to go
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58916:34"/>
among Friends:</hi> Neither do I find <hi>G. Fox</hi> or
<hi>Town of Bethlehem</hi> so much as Mentioned in
it.</p>
               <p>5. Is it not then great Wickedness and
shameful I solency in our Adversary, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to attempt Proof of such a Horrid
Lye against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as is that of calling
<hi>G. Fox the</hi> BRANCH, <hi>the Star, the Son of
Righteousness, and puting the North of</hi> England
<hi>for the Town of</hi> Bethlehem: Is it not Horrible
Wickedness in our Adversary to persist in
this Notorious Lye and Forgery; and so
much add and heap one Forgery and Abuse
upon another? What say you his Ministers
to these things? Will it be for your Credit
to Encourage him in his Work of Envy and
Falshood against us?</p>
               <p>6. Our Adversary, in his Introduction
p. 6. After he has Cited above a Page
(which he knew in his Conscience, are <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical
Expressions</hi> intending the Spiritual
Weapons and Warfare, and the Saints Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
and victory) according to <hi>Ephe</hi> 6.
12, 17. He puts his own Perverse and False
Notes thereupon in the Margin.</p>
               <p>As where <hi>Ameleck, the Egyptians and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines</hi>
are Threatned; so as to <hi>be cut off.</hi>
He makes this Note upon it in the Margin,
<hi>viz. Which by Interpretation was all that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Jesus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>and that called the
Scriptures the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereby he endeavours to render the
<hi>Quakers</hi> to be <hi>for cutting off and destroying all
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58916:34"/>
that profess Jesus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible!
Did ever more deadly Malice, bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Envy and Falshood appear in any Agent
of Satan? And how evidently against his
own Conscience too, who knew the People
called <hi>Quakers</hi> professed no other Sword nor
Weapons for them to make use of, but such
as are Spiritual; and to be actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in no other Fighting, but in the
<hi>Lamb</hi>'s War.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Fra. Howgill</hi> writes of <hi>bathing their
Sword in the Blood of</hi> Ameleck, <hi>and the</hi> Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Allegorical Expressions,
and not <hi>Literally</hi> to be understood, but of
the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is <hi>the Word of
God:</hi> And that <hi>War</hi> of the Lord's Camp
was <hi>Spiritual,</hi> because of his Power and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and <hi>Angel of his</hi> Covenant among
them: And <hi>the Lord of Hosts is with us,</hi> (saith
he.) By these and divers other passages,
'tis evident he meant no other but a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
War with Spiritual Weapons, like as
the Prophets meant, <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 14, 15, 16.
<hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
               <p>7. Also on the words, <hi>Let not your Eye
pity, nor your Hand spare,</hi> he has this Note,
viz. <hi>Why then should you be pitied or spared?</hi>
Thus injuriously restraining the words to a
Literal Sense which were Allegorical, on
purpose to render us most obnoxious, and
for no pity to be shewn us, but as if he would
have us all destroyed at once: Oh most
cruel and deadly Malice.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:58916:35"/>
               <p>8. <hi>On the following words,</hi> But wound
the Lofty, and tread under foot the Honourable
of the Earth; give unto the great Whore dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>&amp;c. he thus Notes,</hi> viz. Meaning both
Gentry, and Clergy, and Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh horrid and implacable Malice, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
and Falshood! They did not mean
Literally, as of an outward wounding or
treading under Feet, nor of any truly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
Gentry, or others; but in Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
against such great Persecutors as had
deeply Drunk of the great Whore's Cup,
who has made her self Drunk with the Blood
of Saints: Therefore 'tis false to say '<hi>twas
meant of Gentry,</hi> &amp;c. or without Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Again, our Adversary in p. 7. repeats
his so often refuted Forgery and Lie, <hi>viz.</hi>
That our Friend's said <hi>Epistle, Compared
the North of</hi> England <hi>to the Town of</hi> Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,
<hi>and</hi> G. Fox <hi>to the Branch, the Star,
the Sun of Righteousness,</hi> &amp;c. which Falshood
has been refuted over and over, tho' here
he varies in's Charge from the terms of his
first Charge, which was, that the <hi>Quakers
PVT the North of</hi> England <hi>for the Town of</hi>
Bethlehem. Now, 'tis COMPARED <hi>the
North of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the first it was,
viz. <hi>They call</hi> G. F. <hi>the Branch, the Star,
the Son of Righteousness; now 'tis they compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to the Branch,</hi> &amp;c. Thus mutable
he is in his Accusations and Calumnies, yet
grosly false in both. Is this your <hi>Defender
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58916:35"/>
of Eternal Truths?</hi> And are these <hi>his Pious
Endeavours,</hi> for which you his Approvers
have so highly Congratulated him?</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Farther, to aggravate Matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, our Adversary adds, p.</hi> 7. viz.—Prophecies
and Curses, which bear the Figure
of your Private Sermons, by which they snared
and frighted me, and many more, from the
Publick; and now they have obtained their End,
and made Rents and Division in Church and
State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Tho' here he renders himself but a
dark, poor, <hi>frightful</hi> Creature, as if in his
first leaving the Publick or Parish Priests, he
did it only upon a <hi>Fright,</hi> and as a <hi>Non Compos
Mentis,</hi> and not from a Principle of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
or Conviction; yet herein he does but
greatly wrong his Conscience, and deny the
real Truth, by a very slim and false Cover,
and that in manifest Contradiction to his
Confessions and Testimonies extant in Print,
both before and since his Revolt <hi>to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
(as he calls it) as has been often
shewn him, and made evident to the World
in our Answers to his Envious and Bitter
Invectives; as where he has solemnly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
<q> To the Truth of the Principle,
Foundation, Doctrine, Ministry, Faith,
Love, Unity, Spiritual Testimony of the
People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as in the beginning,
and as being the Church whereof Christ
Jesus was the Head and Law-giver &amp;c.</q> as
he confesseth far more largely in his Book,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58916:36"/>
Entituled, <hi>De Christiana Libertate,</hi> 2d Part,
Chap. 1. p. 24, 25, 26, 27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Printed
1682, before his return back to the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>
Surely he was not frighted into such
Solemn Confessions, nor did he make them
in a fright, he was more deliberate therein,
and which said Confessions, in behalf of the
People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and their Christian
Religion, are largely seconded and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him the said <hi>F. Bugg</hi> himself, even in
his Pamphlet stiled, <hi>The Quakers detected,</hi>
Printed 1686. about Two Years after he
left us, and turned to the Publick, (as he
calls it) wherein he also largely and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
confesseth, <q>To the Truth of the
said Peoples Principle (as in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
and of their Doctrine and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
as a Dispensation of God's Love;
their Christian Love and Society for
many Years,<note place="margin">☞</note> and that God blessed
their Meetings with the Comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Enjoyment of his Presence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> as may
be seen more at large in the whole third
page of his said Pamphlet, <hi>Quakers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I would Query, 1. Whether <hi>F. Bugg</hi>
made all these solemn Confessions in a <hi>fright?</hi>
O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was he scared or <hi>frighted</hi> by any Man,
or Men, or Prophecies, or Sermons of ours
thereunto? 2. Or was he not rather Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious
in those Confessions? 3. Was he
not rather <hi>frighted</hi> back to the Priests by
Persecution, and so made his flight in the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58916:36"/>
Winter for Refuge, and shelter among
them whom he had testified against? 4.
May he not then be ashamed of such a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Excuse and false Cover, as that of his
being scared and <hi>frighted</hi> from the Publick
by <hi>Quakers</hi> Prophecies or Sermons?</p>
               <p>2. To the latter part of his Charge, I
deny it, that the <hi>Quakers have made Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
not only in Church, but in State?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 1. In what Church have they made
Division? If he says the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
then he renders it a divided Church; which
I suppose you its Ministers will not own,
nor thank him for rendring your Church
divided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 2. In what <hi>State</hi> have they made Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision?
Is not this an audacious Affront to
the State, and maliciously to render us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
thereto, and so to expose us to
Persecution and Ruin? Oh monstrous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
and Cruelty!</p>
               <p>Our Adversary's Charge of <hi>most horrid
Blasphemy</hi> upon that Innocent Sufferer <hi>Ja.
Parnell,</hi> p. 7. for saying, To the end of
Disputes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am come, for before they
was, <hi>I am;</hi> which he sets in opposition to
<hi>John 8. 58. Verily, before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I
am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think he might in Charity (and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
too) have found a better Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for <hi>J. P</hi>'s words, than <hi>most horrid Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,</hi>
that being an unpardonable Sin. As
[either before Disputes was, <hi>I am;</hi> or
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58916:37"/>
before Disputes, <hi>I am,</hi> was, or] before]
is as well a Comparative Expression of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
as of <hi>Time,</hi> or <hi>Presence,</hi> as <hi>Suprà</hi>
before or above; and therefore 'tis no <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi>
to say, <hi>above</hi> Disputes I am; or I am
come into that which was before Disputes.
But suppose <hi>Ja. Parnell</hi> was short, or failed
in Expression; I shall more easily grant that
than that he was a most horrid Blasphemer.</p>
               <p>P. 8, 9, That distinction between Christ,
and the <hi>Body</hi> in which <hi>he</hi> came, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spiritually in his Saints, and as he is
the Seed which bruiseth the Serpent's Head,
he is not wholly excluded out of Man; for
the same Christ that was Crucified being
Spiritually in us, this I take to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what's contained in those Citations
in p. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>I do not see Christ denied hereby, or that
<hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>deny Jesus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>to be the
Christ of God,</hi> as is often falsly charged upon
them, and as often refuted: And if our
Opposer will needs have the <hi>Body,</hi> which
Christ took upon him, to be the <hi>imire Christ,</hi>
how then does he confess on <hi>John</hi> 1. 10.
That <hi>He</hi> (i. e. Christ) <hi>was in the World,
and the World was made by him, and the World
knew him not.</hi>

               <p>P 5. <hi>Intro. Qu.</hi> Did that Body which
Christ took upon him make the World?
Or Christ the Word which took Flesh, or
assumed that Body?</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58916:37"/>
               <p>Tho' I said I may see cause other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to word the Matter,<note place="margin">☞</note> and yet
our Intentions be the same. <hi>Count.
Convert,</hi> p. 72. quoted by our Adversary; I
did not thereby intend either to deny Christ,
or undervalue his Death and Sufferings, or
to contemn the Scriptures, as he seems un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
to suggest, p. 9, 10. seeing they are
Imputations and Aspersions which we have
endeavoured to wipe off and remove, as we
have frequently done.</p>
               <p>There's another great Abuse and Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which our Adversary has again repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against us, as one that's implacable, and
bent to evade our plain Answers, and to
persist in his Calumnies and Lies, when he
has formed the Query, <hi>Whether was the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of Christ, or the Sufferings of the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<hi>greatest?</hi> Then he saith <hi>Edw. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi>
says, <hi>the Sufferings of the</hi> Quakers <hi>was
greatest,</hi> (wherein he wrongs <hi>E. B</hi>'s words)
and then most falsly saith, <hi>viz. and</hi> G. W.
<hi>hath not yet said, the Sufferings of Christ was
greatest; no other word will do, I still pursue
the terms of my</hi> Query, <hi>and wait to have it
answered, but I find.</hi> G. W. <hi>pinched, and in
a great strait, and knows not which way to
winde him,</hi> p. 10, 11. and hereupon he
brings forth a great storm of Railery, Scorn
and Calumny against us, <hi>as not fit for any
Place of Trust, not fit to have our</hi> Yea <hi>and</hi> Nay
<hi>pass for an Oath, aspersing the</hi> Quakers <hi>with

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58916:38"/>
Scorn and Contempt, and all without

<hi>Query,</hi> being directly answered to the terms
of it twice over: 1. In the Sheet, in the
Quakers <hi>Vindication from</hi> F. Bugg<hi>'s Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
which was given to the Parliament.
2. In my Answer to his <hi>Quakerism Wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
Entituled, <hi>The Counterfeit Convert a
Scandal to Christianity,</hi> p. 36, 37 Now
that you, who are <hi>F. B</hi>'s Teachers and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers,
may see (that instead of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
<hi>Eternal Truths,</hi> or <hi>Pious Endeavours,</hi>
as you have commended him) how wilfully
he has belyed me twice over in this Matter,
and how that I have given him direct An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to his <hi>Query,</hi> by confessing the <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Christ</hi> were greatest, and therefore
not pinched, nor in any such strait to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
him, as he falsly renders me, I shall
now give you a third Repetition of his
Query, and my Answer, as they are in
Print twice over.</p>
               <p>Bugg<hi>'s Query,</hi> Whether was the Sufferings
of Christ, or the Sufferings of the <hi>Quakers</hi>
greatest?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. <q>In the first place we Answer,
The Sufferings of Christ in the Nature of
them, both inward and outward, in Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Soul, and Pains of Body, by that
most Cruel Death of the Cross, following
that of Scourging and Crowning with
Thorns.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:58916:38"/>
2. <q>It was most unjustly and wickedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
by his Persecutors, the <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Heathen;</hi> yet worse in the <hi>Jews,</hi> because
they might have known better, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they prosecuted him upon False Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And as Christ's Sufferings were
most Cruel and Unjust, both as to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thereof, and the Dignity of him that
Suffered, so he was a most Acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and Sweet-smelling Savour to God,
and his Suffering and Sacrifice of Universal
Advantage and Benefit to Mankind, in that
he Died for all Men, and gave himself a
Ransom for all, that all might be capable
of Redemption and Salvation through
him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, pray observe what more direct An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s <hi>Query</hi> could I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
The <hi>Query</hi> is, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>Whether was
the Sufferings of Christ, or the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the <hi>Quakers</hi> greatest? Answ.</q> 1.
The Sufferings of Christ in the nature of
them, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Sufferings of Christ were
greatest, for the Answer is directly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant
to the terms of the Question).</p>
               <p>2. Christ's Sufferings most exalted and
esteemed, because of the Dignity of him
that Suffered.</p>
               <p>And this was obvious to <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Eyes
twice over in Print, 1. In our said <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
2. In the said <hi>Counterfeit Convert a
Scandal to Christianity,</hi> in Answer to his
<hi>Quakerism Withering.</hi> With what Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58916:39"/>
then could he say, G. W. <hi>hath not yet
said the Sufferings of Christ was greatest, and
that he finds</hi> G. W. <hi>pinched, and in a great
strait?</hi> What notorious Falshoods are
these?</p>
               <p>And suppose, as he would insinuate, such
a direct Answer from me, would thwart
some of <hi>E. B</hi>'s Expressions in this point:
Or that he was mistaken in some words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
therein, (which I deny not) does it
therefore follow, that I am such a great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
in esteeming him a Prophet, and
that therefore <hi>down goes Infallibility</hi> it self,
according to our Adversaries Arguing? By
such Logick who may escape his Uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Unjust Censure of <hi>new kind of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</hi>
For 'tis as rare Logick, as to argue, a
good Man may be some time mistaken in
some Expressions, therefore he is always
mistaken, consequently a false Prophet, or
fallible and mistaken in every thing: But
this will not hold, for this were to condemn
both <hi>Samuel, David, Elijah, Job,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as no true, but false Prophets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
sometime mistaken. See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.
6. 1 <hi>Kings 19. 14, 15, 18. Rom.</hi> 11. 4:
See also <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 5. And, in the Antient
Approved Bibles, see what Remark is in the
Argument on <hi>Job,</hi> it's there said, <q>That
<hi>Job</hi> maintaineth a Good Cause, but hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it Evil. Again, his Adversaries have
an ill Matter, but they defend it Craftily.
Moreover, he (<hi>i. e. Job</hi>) was assured
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58916:39"/>
that God had not rejected him, yet thro'
his great Torments and Affliction he bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
forth into many inconveniences both
of Words and Sentences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> yet <hi>Job</hi> was
a holy and just Man, and true Prophet in
many things.</p>
               <p>Our Bitter Persecutor would fain fasten
<hi>Contempt of Holy Scripture</hi> upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
with these odious Assertions, <hi>viz. That the
Scripture is</hi> BEASTLY <hi>Ware; that</hi> WHAT
<hi>the true Prophets spake was false, and</hi> WHAT
<hi>the false Prophets spake was true,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Intro.</hi>
p. 13. These are three notorious Falshoods
as well as gross Errors, maliciously contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to contradict our sincere Confession,
viz. <q>
                     <hi>That the Holy Scriptures, of the Old and
New Testament, are of Divine Authority, as
being given by Divine Inspiration,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and
that we prefer the Holy Scriptures before all
other Books extant in the World.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>How sincere we are in such Confession,
we can refer to him that knows our Hearts,
to whom we Appeal against our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
contrary, unjust Judgment, and gross
Calumnies, falsly representing us insincere,
even in these weighty Matters, wherein the
greatest Tenderness and Conscienciousness
towards God ought to be exercised by us all.</p>
               <p>Another gross Abuse our. Bitter Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
has committed against many of us, who
Signed an Epistle from our Yearly Meeting
in 1675. which I must give some Account of
here.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:58916:40"/>
1. He Cites these words out of our said
Epistle, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>It is our Sence, Advice, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
and Judgment, in the Fear of
God, and Authority of his Power and
Spirit, that no such slight and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Names and Expressions, as that Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Friends Papers (which we Testifie
have been given out by the Power and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God) are Mens Edicts or Canons,
with such scornful Sayings, be permitted.
Subscribed (saith he) by <hi>W. Penn, G.
Whitehead,</hi> and others. <hi>Introd.</hi> p. 11.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And what of all this? This Advice rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to such Papers and Epistles of Faithful
Friends, as concerned good Order and
Discipline in the Church, and for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
pure Religion in Life and Practice;
and why should they be slighted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
as but <hi>meer Human Edicts and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons?</hi>
What use does our Scornful Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
make of this? Observe what he saith,
p. 13. viz. <hi>But as for what</hi> G. F. &amp;c. <hi>wrote,
their Yearly Meeting Testifies it was given forth
by the Eternal Spirit; yea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> THE SAME
MEN <hi>that charged their Disciples in the
Name of the Lord not to call their Papers
Edicts or Canons, call the Scriptures Death,
Dust, and Serpents Meat.</hi> And what <hi>same
Men?</hi> He has told us before <hi>W. Penn, G.
Whitehead,</hi> and others who Signed the said
Yearly Meetings Epistle, that they so called
the Scriptures, whereby he has greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused,
and shamefully belied the <hi>same Men,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58916:40"/>
(i. e. W. P. G. W.</hi> &amp;c.) for they disown
the Expression, and own the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Holy Scriptures, as first given
by Inspiration from God, and truly prefer
them before all other Books extant in the
World. But how can that be in our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary's
Account, when he objects against
it and us, <hi>That</hi> G. W. <hi>avouches, that what
is spoken from the Spirit of Truth</hi> IN ANY,
<hi>is of as great Authority as the Scriptures and
Chapters are, and Greater?</hi> &amp;c. He shews
himself but very dull and impertinent in
this Objection, For we may prefer the
Scriptures, even the Bible, before all other
Books extant, and yet not before the Spirit
of Truth, or the Immediate Powerful
Teachings thereof in Man; for that Spirit
was before the Scriptures Writings, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
were, and only can give the true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
thereof; and therefore the Spirit
of Truth may be preferred to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and all other Books, without any
contempt or slight to them. This Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is more fully Answered elsewhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To our Adversary's saying,</hi> viz. <hi>G. W.</hi>
tells me, I was but a kind of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and I
think 'tis the truest word in his Book, I think I
was not above a third part of one, and that too
much too, <hi>p.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Thus he would fain winde off from the
Reputation he had of a <hi>Quaker</hi> for 25 Years
together; he now miserably shifts and
minces the Matter, but manifestly contrary
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58916:41"/>
to his own Confession, in his <hi>Quakers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,</hi>
p. 3 as before quoted to my Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
Whether <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> when a Quaker,
denied Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be the <hi>Efficient</hi>
cause of Man's Salvation? He Answers,
<hi>I do believe I then did not hold the worst part of
Quakerism,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet I do freely Acknowledge
that I was in great Errors, Particularly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Point of Justfication: For I then Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Salvation through my Obedience to the</hi>
LIGHT, <hi>which the</hi> Quakers <hi>taught, was Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to Salvation: But since it pleased God
to open my Eyes, I believe that Salvation is
attained, through the Mercy of God is Christ
Jesus, by Faith in the Merits of his Passion
and Obedience to his Precepts,</hi> p. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>Observe here: 1. He now counts it a
great Error to Expect Salvation through
Obedience <hi>to the Light,</hi> without Distinction
of What Light.</p>
               <p>2. He Opposeth the the Sufficiency of
the Light for Salvation. And 3. Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Salvation through the Mercy of God
in Christ Jesus; Faith in his Merits and
Passion, and Obedience to his Precepts.
These he Opposeth TO Obedience to his
Light, and Expecting Salvation through
the same: These he sets in Opposition;
as one that expects <hi>Salvation</hi> through the
Mercy of God in Christ Jesus, and by Faith
in his Merits, and Obedience to his Passion,
without Obedience to his Light. For that
End, Expresly Contrary to Christ's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58916:41"/>
and his Apostles Testimonies.</p>
               <p>1. Christ Commanded, <hi>Believe in the
Light that ye may be the Children of the Light.</hi>
And this Believing in the Light, was a
necessary Act of Obedience, in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
2. Christ saith, <hi>I am the Light of the
World, he that followeth Me shall not abide in
Darkness.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>James</hi> Exhorts
to a <hi>Receiving the Ingrafted Word which is
able to save the Soul:</hi> And this Word is
both Light and Life; <hi>In him was Life, and
that Life was the Light of Men:</hi> Therefore
the Light is Sufficient to Salvation. 3.
Salvation through the Mercy of God in
Jesus Christ, true Faith in his Merits, and
Suffering for us; and Sincere Obedience to
his Precepts, cannot be attained nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
without Faith in, and Obedience
to his Light; it was the Mercy of God to
us, to afford us Light to lead us out of
Darkness: For Men in Darkness are Blind,
and (as such) cannot see the Mercy of God
in Christ Jesus, nor true Faith in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
or Suffering: For 'tis in Walking in
the Light that we know the Blood of Jesus
Christ to Cleanse us from all Sin, 1 <hi>John</hi>
1. 7. But alas! What sad Confusion and
Darkness is our Adversary in, whilst he
concludes God opened his Eyes to Believe,
in the Mercy of God in Christ, and obey
his Precepts, and yet not to expect Salvation
through Obedience to the Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:58916:42"/>
Oh! Dark and Disobedient Man, can
thy Eyes be open to see without Light?
2. Or canst thou attain Salvation in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
3. Or canst thou truly yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Christ's Precepts, either in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or without Obedience to his Light in
thee? When to Believe in the Light was
an Express Precept of Christ? 4. And is
this Obedience to the Light, no Step nor
Advance towards Salvation? 5. Seeing
<hi>Christ is the Author of Eternal Salvation to
as many as obey him;</hi> can any truly obey
him, but in his Light? The Steps we make
towards Salvation, are in the Light, and
not in Darkness; And Christ being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of Eternal Salvation; 'tis to those on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that believe and obey him; for true
Faith in the Light, and true Faith in Christ,
is but one true Living Faith. As Christ in
the Heavens, and his Light in Man are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable.</p>
               <p>Here follows some more of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary's
Palpable Falshoods and Aspersions,
cast upon us in his own Words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You can neither make Confession of Sin to
God, nor begg Pardon for Christ's Sake,
<hi>p.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>2. You do not Pray after that manner.</p>
               <p>3. You do not Pray in the Name of Christ
(to God the Father) as the Mediator and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor
between God and Man, <hi>p.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>4. You lay aside the Scripture, as useless,
<hi>p.</hi> 15, 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:58916:42"/>
5. You deny the Ordinances of Jesus Christ,
as Baptism and the Lord's Supper, <hi>WHICH
THE SCRIPTURES TEACH; saying,</hi> Go
Teach all Nations, Baptizing them, &amp;c.
<hi>p.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>6. You lay aside the Vse of the Lord<hi>'s</hi>

               </p>
               <p>7. You Rob Christ of his Divine Attributes,
and put them upon your Glorified <hi>G. FOX,</hi>
calling him the <hi>Branch,</hi> the <hi>Star,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of
<hi>Righteousness,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>For which, his so often Repeated Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Lie, he bids us see our Epistle,
<hi>This is only to go amongst Friends: Whioh,</hi> he
saith, <hi>is Largely Recited in this his Introduction,</hi>
&amp;c. To which I again Answer, I have
viewed his Citation, and examined both <hi>F.
Howgill</hi>'s and <hi>E. Burrough</hi>'s Epistles in their
Works; out of which he Cites divers of
the Words before, but find not one Word
of <hi>G. Fox</hi> mentioned in either, much less
any calling HIM <hi>the Branch, the Star,
the Son of Righteousness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> which great
Abominable Lie, <hi>F. Bugg</hi> would feign
some Colour of Proof for, to Justifie his
seigned <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ck-Trial</hi> and <hi>Pillory,</hi> to Render
us Odious for our Positive Denyal of this,
and some others of his most gross Lies and
sordid Chlaumnies and Forgeries cast upon
us. To which, his said great Lie, he Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
and Falsly adds, <hi>viz. Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding</hi>
G. W's <hi>Denial is plainly Proved
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58916:43"/>
to MEAN</hi> G. FOX (Quoth he) Which is
a Notorious Falshood again. Thus instead
of plain Proof of Matters of Fact, as Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he Unjustly Imposeth his own False
<hi>Meaning</hi> for Proof. Thus see how hardly
this poor Envious Creature is put to his
Shifts, to defend, gloss and cover his gross
Lies, Deceit and Falshood, wherewith he
has been long Labouring and Working hard
to cover himself, but all will not do: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you who are <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Ministers, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Approvers, if he be one of your
Eminent Agents, one of your Converts,
and Esteemed your <hi>Pious Defender of
Truth,</hi> one of your strong Oaks, and
great Champions to Detect and Convict
the <hi>Quakers</hi> of Errors, you may be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of your Oaks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who further adds
for Proof of his said Abominable Lie, <hi>viz.
Yet to strengthen the said Proof, See</hi> John
Whitehead<hi>'s Small Treatise,</hi> p. 4, 5. <hi>After
these things in the Year 1648. God, who had
Compassion on his People, did cause</hi> A BRANCH
<hi>to Spring forth of the Root of</hi> David, <hi>which
was filled with Virtue, and the Covenant of
Life and Peace was with him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And in
the Year 1655. I being a Branch of this Tree
(meaning</hi> G. FOX, Quoth <hi>F. Bugg.</hi>) Thus
again he is put to his sorry Shifts, but this
will not do for Proof: For,</p>
               <p>1. Here's no mention of calling <hi>G. Fox,
the Branch, the Star, the Sun of Righteousnes,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:58916:43"/>
2. That God did Cause <hi>A Branch</hi> to
Spring sorth of the Root of <hi>David, &amp;c.</hi>
may be true of some Eminent Instrument
in God's Hand and Work (But observe,
'tis here <hi>A Branch,</hi> not <hi>The Branch</hi>) and
yet not to put the same Instrument for
Christ, because Christ is both the <hi>Root</hi> and
<hi>Off-spring of</hi> David, <hi>the Bright and Morning
Star, and the Heavenly Vine also;</hi> OUT of
which many Branches have Sprung and
brought Forth Fruit in him.</p>
               <p>3. All the Trees of the Lord, that Spring
from the true Root Christ Jesus, (who is
the Root of <hi>David</hi>) are full of Sap and
Heavenly Virtue, yet all Prefer the Root
that bears them, and the Rock which is
higher than they; and do not put the
Branches for the Root, nor instead of him,
who is (by way of Eminency) called, <hi>The
Branch, the Star, the Son of Righteousness,</hi>
which no Member of his (how Eminent
soever) may assume to himself, tho' he
has the Morning Star promised to be given
him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 28.</p>
               <p>Thus far to <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Additions and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations

the end of his said <hi>2d Edition;</hi> tho' it be
a Sheet of Rambling Stuff, and much of it

               <p>
                  <hi>Aganist</hi> R. Ashby <hi>Our Adversary saith,</hi> It

at <hi>Ben. Antrobus</hi> his House, according to his
Word, but did not; tho' <hi>G. W.</hi> and others
waited long for him. This he says is False,
for he never gave <hi>G. W.</hi> his Word or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to meet him there, or any where else, to
dispute the Points in Controversie, unless that
he would first engage under his Hand to Retract

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Our Adversary knows how Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious,
Shuffling and Shifting he has been
in this Point: For,</p>
               <p>1. Observe his own Letter, Dated <hi>Jan.</hi>
29. 1693. (In acceptance of my Printed
Challenge) thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>George Whitehead,</p>
               <p>In Answer to your faint Challenge, in your
pretended Vindication, to meet me in any place
in <hi>London. I DO ACCEPT THEREOF</hi>
and am come to <hi>London,</hi> being 60 Miles to
meet you.</p>
               <p>Was not this his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Engagement</hi>
Sufficient to meet me in <hi>London,</hi> without
Exception; as for a Convenient Place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:58916:44"/>
which <hi>B. A</hi>'s was esteem'd to be, he could
neither except against the Place or Time,
when proposed to him at <hi>Jacob Frankling</hi>'s,
the of the Twelfth Month 1693. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
several Witnesses. And I did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to <hi>F. B.</hi> any uncivil, confused, tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
or populous Meeting to Debate Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
if I had, he might justly have rejected
my Proposal, but a Meeting of a few Sober,
Moderate Persons, to be Witnesses only of
what passed; and such did meet with me at
several Convenient Places in <hi>London,</hi> but
were disappointed by <hi>F. B</hi>'s keeping away.</p>
               <p>2. The Conditional Retraction, proposed
by him, was afterward contrived for an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
shift, when he saw I was in earnest,
and resolved to meet him before some Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
as proposed, and appointed several
Times and Places in <hi>London</hi> so to meet him,
giving him timely notice aforehand, and
waited for him several Hours, but he would
not Adventure to come and give me Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for a fair Disquisition of Matters in
Controversie, unless I would either submit
them to the Judgment and Determination
of Persons of a contrary Perswasion, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
engage to such a Conditional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction;
as he proposed; all which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
designed shuffles, and shameful evasions,
to shun Meeting as aforesaid, (contrary to
his own Word and Acceptance before-cited)
as may be seen more at large in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
Entituled, <hi>The Counterfeit Convert a

distance, and falsly telling the World, that
Whitehead <hi>evaded and shuffled (i. e.</hi> from
Meeting him) p. 2. which was his own
act, not mine, but a notorious and gross
Lie, as many then present can testifie how
many Hours I waited for him time after
time, and my Letters and Challenges also
wherewith I followed him from time to
time; if he durst but produce them in Print,
they would manifestly decide this Matter
between us, wherein he most falsly asperseth
me with his own Act of evasion and shuffling,
as if he were such a Potent <hi>Goliah,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable

Then our Adversary goes on Canting,
Taunting, and Abusing us from this passage,
as with <hi>Equivocating Jesuitism with a Witness,
or</hi> Arius <hi>risen again under a new form and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi>

has insinuated most grievous Lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

2. <hi>As intending the same.</hi> 3. Yet otherwise
word the Matter, <hi>to Equivocate, and act the

observe how notorious his Abuse and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
is in this very Matter! That I was
dissatisfied with wording that Matter, in
some recited Expressions, I grant, but that
<hi>Is. Penington</hi>'s meaning, or mine either, was
to <hi>deny Christ,</hi> I utterly deny. Observe the
passage at large quoted, <hi>Counterfeit Convert,</hi>
p. 72. which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>I know no <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous
Speeches</hi> of our Lord Jesus, or of

owned by me. And tho' I have evinced
<hi>I. P</hi>'s meaning on his words reflected on,
about the Body or Flesh of Christ, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
not, that I thereby make his Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
mine, seeing I note them as his. I
may see cause otherwise to word the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and yet our Intentions be the same:
We have not the same Expressions and Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
in all Cases, and yet may aim at,
and mean the same thing, but never to
contemn our Blessed Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58916:46"/>
Christ, (or the Holy Scriptures which
testifie of him) in any respect, far be it
from us so to do. Therefore <hi>T. C.</hi> (yea,
and <hi>F. B.</hi> too) have grosly wronged and
misrepresented us in these Matters.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, pray observe, here's no such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession

               <p>Implying, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> intend all

profess to the contrary, whereupon the
Nick-name of <hi>Counterfeit Quaker</hi> is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>And further, to pacifie our angry Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
as to what he has noted Fundamental
Errors, Damnable Heresies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (tho' I
cannot in Justice Charge the Persons accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

in us,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>And that when Christ ascended,
he was separated from his Body. 3. And that
Faith in Christ without us, as he Died for our
Sins, and Rose again, was not necessary to</hi>
OUR <hi>Salvation,</hi> p. 37. These I do really
disown as contrary to my Sence and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to Holy Scriptures Testimony,
as sincerely believing, 1. The Only True
and Living God is Immortal. 2. That
Christ visibly Ascended in his Body. 3. And
therefore that Christ did not only Die for
our Sins, but Rose again for our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and consequently that Faith in him,
as he so Died, and Rose again, and Ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Glory, is necessary not only to our
Salvation, but to all others that have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

Demonstration or Proof of the same,

               <p>The unbelief thereof, when so demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,

their Sins.</p>
               <p>Yet for those Moral and Pious <hi>Gentiles,</hi>

               <p>Whereas I intimated in my Epistle to
<hi>The Counterfeit Convert</hi> in these words, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>I do hereby sincerely declare, That 'tis
not for Controversie sake that I am so much
engag'd therein; nor am I the beginner of
these Controversies, being wholly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And what has our Adversary against
this? [I know it to be very true, tho' the
Devil and all his Agents should say the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and endeavour to outface me with
their Lies]. Our Adversary saith, <hi>viz.</hi> I
<hi>am willing to let</hi> Richard Ashbye <hi>know, that his
Brother</hi> Whitehead <hi>is false in this also:</hi> And
why so? <hi>For</hi> (quoth <hi>F. B.) he writ against
Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Independants, and
Baptists, before ever they wrote against him.
Answer,</hi> I deny that, and we have no proof
but his own bare <hi>ipse dixit</hi> for it. Some of
them, (i. e. <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s time,
when the <hi>Episcopal had no Power</hi>) begun to
Persecute and Imprison me and others, and
also to defame us in Print before ever I was
concerned in Printed Controversie against
them; and it was the worst and most rigid
sort that I was so concerned against, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58916:48"/>
therefore not the beginner of either of those
first Controversies, (<hi>i. e.</hi> with some <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>)
nor yet of these with this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
but was and am still wholly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.</p>
               <p>And suppose (as he saith) I had <hi>writ
Ten Books against others to One Book against
me, of any one Man's Writing,</hi> I did not write
Ten Books against any one Man, for only
his One Book against me: But suppose Ten
Books wrote either by Ten Persons, more
or fewer, either against me in particular,
or against me, inclusively with others;
and I had or have wrote Ten Answers to
those Ten Books; this proves me not a
<hi>Contentious Scribler,</hi> as he renders me; but
still I am on the defensive part, and put upon
a necessity of being defensive.</p>
               <p>Yet, to prove me false herein, our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
adds, viz. <hi>And in Nine Months time
he wrote Three Books against me, to one of mine
against the</hi> Quakers; <hi>and Two of them without
any fresh occasion given him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>F. Bugg</hi> knows he gave the first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he begun the Controversie, and that
I was wholly defensive therein, by way of
Answer to his bitter Invectives, and foul
Aspersions against the <hi>Quakers</hi> (so called)
their Order and Discipline; for did I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to be concerned, before his Book <hi>De
Christiana Libertate</hi> came forth? No; 'twas
his foul Abuses in that Book against us,
gave me the first occasion to appear in Print
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58916:48"/>
against him, and after that his divers other
abusive Books and Pamphlets against us, both
before and since he turn'd to the Priests,
and so often falsly accusing us the said Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with <hi>Contempt of the Scripture, denying
Jesus to be Christ, despising his Ordinances,
his Ministers and Magistrates, making Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Church and State,</hi> p. 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more Calumnies, and all to excuse and
cover his own base Backsliding and Self-condemned
Apostacy, and <hi>Judas</hi>-like to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
both Priests and Rulers against us by
his foul Railery, black and odious Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
which he has maliciously put upon us;
but as to the latter, the Lord has hedged up
his Way, and manifested his Folly, restless
Envy, and implacable deadly Malice unto
many; and our God has given us Power and
Zeal to withstand and oppose him therein,
and trample upon his great Malice, and
such fruitless Attempts to Inveterate Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</p>

            <p>UPON a serious perusal of the said pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

which have been duely Answered, and just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>His Title, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>set in their True

<hi>Quakers,</hi> whose True Light is no other but
<hi>Christ the True Light, which lighteth every
Man coming into the World,</hi> John 1. 9.</p>
            <p>This same pretended History of <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s
appears to be chiefly made up of the same
Abusive and Calumnious Stuff which his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pamphlets are composed of, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
reiterated by him, tho' plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,

which he cannot maintain in Controversie,

               <hi>F. Bugg</hi> in his Epistle, Dedicated to the

hope the said Bishop, on serious Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will not Credit nor Patronize such
gross Railery, nor Esteem it for his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

repeated and refuted gross Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
against the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> in
his said History, with brief Notes on them.</p>
            <p>1. P. 3. <hi>Bugg</hi> saith: <hi>That none Preached
Murther more than the</hi> Quakers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:58916:50"/>
               <hi>Note,</hi> What he alledges for this gross
Calumny, is answered long since in our
Book, Entituled, <hi>Christ's Lambs defended
from Satan's Rage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>P.</hi> 4. That they sit at <hi>Devonshire-house</hi>
to null, make void, and repeal as Vnlawful,
what the King, Lords and Commons make
Lawful at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This Calumny is refuted in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to him before, and his envious design
therein discovered. See <hi>The Counterfeit
Convert,</hi> p. 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>P.</hi> 9. That they prest into the World with
Principles against <hi>ALL</hi> Rule and Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> A loud and most gross Lie; our
Principles were always for Christ's Rule
and Government among Christians, and for
all Just Rule and Government among Men,
as being God's Ordinance.</p>
            <p>4. That the Foundation they went upon was,
under pretence of magnifying the Light in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to deny Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> to underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
his Death and Sufferings, contemn his <hi>Laws</hi>
contain'd in the Holy Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> These are notorious and most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Falshoods; the quite contrary is asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
frequently by us: We magnifie Christ's
Light and Life in Man for no such Ends,
but the contrary, as thereby sincerely to
own and follow the Lord Jesus Christ
through his Sufferings, and according to
his Laws: It was by his Light in us, that
we were led to Suffer with him, and to be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58916:51"/>
Crucified with him, and to Die with him,
that we might Live and Reign with him,
who tasted Death for every Man.</p>
            <p>5. That <hi>G. W.</hi> hath vindicated this, <hi>i. e.</hi>
that the Scripture was Serpent's Meat, Beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ware, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> A foul Calumny against <hi>G. W.</hi>
'twas never my Principle so to term the
Scripture; I have always had from my
Childhood a real esteem and great love
for the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> nor do I know of
any among us that ever called them <hi>Beastly
Ware,</hi> or <hi>Serpents Meat;</hi> nor do we own
the Expressions as applicable to Holy
Scripture, we having also most generally
bought Bibles, which I never heard any
call <hi>Beastly Ware</hi> before, tho' probably
some or other might so term such Mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
on Scripture, as make a Trade
thereof for Money, or filthy Lucre, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I suppose they could not intend any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Holy Scripture, but upon their
Unscriptural Preaching for filthy Lucre.</p>
            <p>6. That <hi>G. W.</hi> and his Followers, have
published a Journal of <hi>G. F</hi>'s deluding Charms,
on purpose to Bewitch the People like <hi>SIMON
MAGUS, p.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This is still foul, filthy, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive;
for, 1. We know no deluding
Charms in that Journal. 2. Nor had we
any such purpose in the Publication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as to Bewitch People. Behold how the
Man belches, vomits and foams out his own
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58916:51"/>
shame against us, contrary to his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Testimonies for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. That <hi>G. F.</hi> wrought Counterfeit Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and never in the Name of Jesus, <hi>p.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This is still enviously to Abuse <hi>G.
F.</hi> and us; we read not, in all his Writings,
that ever he so much as pretended to work
any Miracle, either by himself, or in his
own Name, or by his own Power, but that
by the Power of the Lord, (which is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Name but that which was given to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9.) some Great Things
have been wrought, even in Answer to the
Prayers (and fervent Breathings to God)
of that Good Man, <hi>G. F.</hi> and others of the
Church-partakers of the same Faith in
Christ with him, wherein they did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to pray in any other Name, Power, or
Spirit, but that of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>8. That both <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Parnell</hi> call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Christ in <hi>W. P</hi>'s Since, <hi>p.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> I do not believe <hi>W. Penn</hi> either
gave, or will own any such Sence, it being
contrary to his and all our Sence so to call
any Mortal Man upon Earth, tho' some
may be come to THAT which was before
Languages, or Humane Arguments were,
<hi>i. e.</hi> to the Word and Power of God, and
his Son Jesus Christ, which was only the
same <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>J. Parnell</hi> intended.</p>
            <p>9. That the Humanity of Christ the <hi>Quakers</hi>
deny it as clearly, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> deny his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<hi>p.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:58916:52"/>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This is a gross and notorious Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
we (<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> so called) have
often clearly and scripturally Confessed and
Asserted both the Divinity and Humanity
(<hi>i. e.</hi> Manhood) of Christ Jesus, as many
of our Books manifestly prove.</p>
            <p>10. That the <hi>Foxonian Quakers</hi> say of <hi>G.
Fox,</hi> he is the Power of God, <hi>p.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This also is positively denied by
us as a gross and foul Calumny: Pray
where do any of the <hi>Quakers</hi> so say of <hi>G. F?</hi>
I know not, (neither do we own his scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Nick-name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Distinction of <hi>Foxonian
Quakers</hi>) for we are sure 'tis contrary to
our Principle and Profession, to set up any
Sect Masters over us, or to <hi>Adore</hi> any Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Man, or Finite Creature, <hi>as</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. <hi>God,</hi> as is also charged upon <hi>G. F</hi>'s
<hi>Followers</hi> touching him, pag. 14.
which we deem also a notorious Falshood.</p>
            <p>12. That all the <hi>Quakers</hi> Prophets being
400 in number, give, Witness to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and
Adore him as the Branch, the Star, the Sun of
Righteousness. <hi>p.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This old Story of <hi>Bugg</hi>'s is a gross
refuted Lie and Calumny, <hi>G. Fox</hi> is not so
much as mentioned in that Epistle, out of
which those words, [<hi>viz. the Branch, the
Star, the Son of Righteousness</hi>] are taken,
directed to the <hi>Camp of the Lord in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
p. 66. of <hi>E. B</hi>'s Works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:58916:52"/>
13. That Baptism and the Lord's Supper
God never commanded, are given forth by them
who are Brazened with Deceit, <hi>p.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This is falsly charged and stated in
both, and contrary to what we have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
confessed with respect to both; for,
1. <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism was by special Command
from Heaven, and had its Dispensation and
Time, as 'twas Typical of Christ's Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Baptism. 2. The Lord's Supper, both
as in the Type, and in the Antitype, in
the Figure, and in the Mystery and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
distinctly and truly considered in
their placed Dispensations, we have often
Scripturally confessed, and even in Answer
to this Adversary, let him review <hi>The</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<hi>Vindication against</hi> F. Bugg'<hi>s Calumnies,</hi>
p. 2. Col. 1. 2.</p>
            <p>14. That <hi>G. F.</hi> was a Blasphemer of the
Blessed Trinity, <hi>p.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> A gross Calumny also: He neither
Blasphemed nor Opposed the Scripture
<hi>Trinity, (i. e.</hi> Three) of the Father, the
Word, (or Son) and Holy Ghost, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
against some Unscriptural Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Terms of Three distinct or separate
Personalities, Subsistances, or Substances,
Unscripturally by some supposed or implied
in the Deity.</p>
            <p>15. That the <hi>Quakers</hi> count all others, who
are not of their Communion, Damned Persons,
<hi>p.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:58916:53"/>
This is both false, and too uncharitable
for the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> to be of such
a severe Judgment, Charitably believing,
that many not in outward Communion with
them, under various Forms of Religion,
may be sincere to God according to their
Understandings and Belief; as also that
there are other Sheep which are not yet of
this Fold, whom Jesus Christ will gather
and fetch home into his Fold; and that in
every Nation and People, such as fear God
and work Righteousness, are and shall be
accepted of him.</p>
            <p>16. That the Jesuit taught them this, That
they must not by any means Swear, <hi>p.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> A gross Lye, for Jesus Christ
taught us not to Swear, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and so did
his Holy Apostle <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 5. And
many of the Blessed Martyrs and Protestant
Reformers, were of the same Judgment
with us, whom the Papists Accused and
Persecuted for the same, who imposed
Swearing as their Priests taught, contrary
to Christ's Command.</p>
            <p>17. That this sullen and dogged Sect, is the
Jesuit's natural and undoubted Issue, tho' like
other Bastards, they are ashamed to own their
Father, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> These are like some of <hi>Bugg</hi>'s false
and shameful Raileries, and no such thing
could he demonstrate in all the 25 Years,
that he was Conversant among the People
called <hi>Quakers,</hi> or since, nor what <hi>Jesuit</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:58916:53"/>
was then his Father, or to whom he was
then <hi>Bastard;</hi> but the contrary he has in
Print declared for the said People, and their
Doctrine, even since he left them; witness
his <hi>Quakers Detected,</hi> Cited in our <hi>Quakers
Vindication,</hi> and other Answers. But 'tis
an ill and nasty Bird that bewrays its own
Nest, as he has done. These last Aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of <hi>the Jesuits Teaching the</hi> Quakers, <hi>and
they the Jesuits Natural Issue and Bastards,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Bugg</hi> Credulously pretends to Cite out of a
Learned Divine's Book of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> but tells not his Name, that his
Credit may be enquired into; but whatever
he be, he is of no Credit with us in this
foul Aspersion and Abuse.</p>
            <p>18. That the <hi>Quakers</hi> Allegorize the Death
and Sufferings of Christ, his Passion, Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Resurrection and Ascension to be within,
<hi>p.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This is a known Perversion and
Falshood; the true Spiritual-minded <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
do not Allegorize away either the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Sufferings, Passion, or Death, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement,
Resurrection, or Ascension of
Jesus Christ, (as if all these were within
only) for they really believe and own all
these to have been done and transacted out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
and literally, as well as they truly
believe and own the Mystery, Spiritual
Sence, Influence, and real Benefit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
thereof, as Inwardly and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
partaken of, felt, and experienced by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58916:54"/>
every Sincere and Spiritual Believer in
Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>19. That neither if you go to a Thousand of
their Meetings, shall you hear one of their
Preachers have such an Expression in their
Mouths, as Consessing their Sins, and Begging
Pardon for Jesus Christ's sake, <hi>p.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This is a presumptuous Prediction,
such Confession and Supplication have been
oftentimes in publick among us, and may be
again for ought <hi>F. B.</hi> knows, for them that
want Forgiveness and Cleansing from Sin,
well-knowing that the Lord requires both
true Confession, and forsaking Sin; tho'
we do not Confess nor Pray by Book or Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
after the Priest, yet we feel the
Spirit of Christ making Intercession with
Sighs and Groans, which cannot be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>20. That the Scriptures are Beastly Ware,
<hi>p.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This Reproach and Blasphemy <hi>F.
B.</hi> has often most falsly cast upon us; 'tis
Answered before several times, and more
fully hereafter.</p>
            <p>21. That the <hi>Quakers</hi> first rose in the
North, breaking all Law, Order, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<hi>p.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Quakerism</hi> flowed over all our Banks,
of all Law, Order, and Government, both Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Humane, <hi>p.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> Both these are gross and very offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Aspersions, before Answered and Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58916:54"/>
manifestly by our Christian Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>22. That they have a great Tax Collected,
to maintain their Teachers, Travellers, and
Spies, both at Home and Abroad, <hi>p.</hi> 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> For which gross Lies, <hi>F. Bugg</hi>
quotes his own Authority, and bids <hi>see his
Books, Battering Rams against</hi> New Rome,
and New Rome <hi>Vnmask'd,</hi> wherein we do
not only deny his imposed Authority, but
have Refuted and Confuted the same in our
Answers to those his Books quoted by him.</p>
            <p>23. That by their Threatned Chronicle, they
(i. e. <hi>the</hi> Quakers) intend to represent this
Nation as a Persecuting, Bloody-minded Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>p.</hi> 34.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> No such Threatning or Intention
are we justly Chargeable with, nor so to
Represent this Nation, for 'tis not so now,
nor were the People thereof in general such,
when Persecution was on foot; but the
Persecutors in it (many of whom are since
cut off) did openly shew their Cruelty, by
Imprisoning many to Death, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Havock and Spoil upon the Goods of
many Families, to their great Impoverish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Ruin of divers, besides those
that were Banished out of the Land by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors;
but Blessed be God, and Thanks
to the Present Government, the Case is
now altered much for the better on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
those Cruel Persecutions being stopt,
and the present Persecution we are now
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58916:55"/>
under, being chiefly the vile Misrepresenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
gross Lies and Calumnies of dark
and malicious Apostates and Backsliders,
(such as <hi>F. B.</hi>) and their Adherents.</p>
            <p>24. That the <hi>Quakers</hi> prefer their own Books
before and above the Scripture, <hi>p.</hi> 37. That
they prefer their Nonsensical Pamphlets before
the Scriptures, being compared with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Expressions they give them as <hi>BEAST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY
WARE,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> These are some of his Old Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and Perversions frequently Answered
and Refuted; for yet again we solemnly
say, We prefer the Holy Scriptures of the
Old and New Testament, as contained in
the Bible, (and that Book it self) above,
and to all other Books extant in the World,
whether our own or any other Books what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
as sincerely owning the <hi>Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi>

by Divine Inspiration, but most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
confirmed by Divine Authority.</p>
            <p>25. That <hi>G. Keith</hi> could not in Conscience
clear the Body of the <hi>Quakers</hi> from those Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
charged upon them in <hi>Pensilvania,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

approved Writers in <hi>England,</hi> as Sound in

            <p>26. That the Principles and Practices of the

p.</hi> 41.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> Here are two great Falshoods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in this Charge, and they are in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and indefinite Terms too; for, first,
as to those Principles of the <hi>French Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
(as Cited by <hi>F. Bugg</hi> himself, p. 41,
to 47.) they Believe and Confess,</p>
            <p>1. <q>That there is but one God only,
whose Being only is Simple, Spiritual, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
Invisible, Immutable, Insinite, and
Incomprehensible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>2. <q>That in that Divine Being, there be
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</q>
            </p>
            <p>3. <q>That the Father is the First Cause, in
Order, and the Beginning of all things;
the Son his Everlasting Word; the Holy
Ghost his Vertue, Power, and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>4. <q>That tho' these <hi>Divine Three</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
or distinguished (<hi>i. e.</hi> as to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Properties of Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost) yet not divided, but of One and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58916:56"/>
the Same Essence (i. e. <hi>Being</hi>) Eternity,
Power, and Equality</q>
            </p>
            <p>5. <q>That the Doctrine contained in the
<hi>Holy Scriptures, (i. e.</hi> of the Old and New
Testament) proceeds from God, from
whom only, and not from Men, it derives
its Authority, and that all <hi>Matters necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
required for the Worship of God, and our
Salvation,</hi> are therein <hi>testified,</hi> (they say
<hi>contained</hi>) and therefore that 'tis not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for Men or Angels to <hi>add unto, take
from,</hi> or <hi>change</hi> this DOCTRINE, (<hi>i. e.</hi>
the Doctrine necessary to God's Worship,
and our Salvation, as they say.)</q>
            </p>
            <p>6. <q>That God, of his Rich Grace, Mercy
and Bounty, delivers his Children through
our Lord Jesus Christ, (<hi>i. e.</hi> from Sin and
Condemnation.)</q>
            </p>
            <p>7. <q>That Jesus Christ, being the Wisdom
and Eternal Son of God, took upon him
the Nature of Man, so that he is God and
Man; (but <hi>one Lord Jesus Christ</hi>) and, that
he might be able to suffer in Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
was made like unto us in all things,
Sin only excepted; so that as to <hi>Man's</hi>
Nature, he was indeed of the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and <hi>David,</hi> Conceived in due time in
the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and Incomprehensible Power of the
Holy Ghost; and that in one and the same
Lord Jesus Christ, his Two Natures (<hi>i. e.</hi>
as God and Man) are inseparably united,
yet each retaining its distinct Properties;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58916:56"/>
so considering Christ in his Deity, as not
to deprive him of his <hi>Manhood,</hi> we having
one Mediator between God and Men, even
the Man Christ Jesus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>8. <q>That by that one Sacrifice which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ Offered upon the Cross, we are
Reconciled unto God (<hi>i. e.</hi> being Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
by his Death, we, who believe in him,
shall be saved by his Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.)</q>
            </p>
            <p>9. <q>That the Lord Jesus Christ, by the
Power and Spirit of God, was Raised
from the Dead;</q> [to which I add, That
he ever lives in his own proper glorious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
in which he Ascended into Glory, and
wherein he is Head of his Mystical Body,
the Church, which as united to him and his
Glorious Body, is One Body, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 12,
20, 27. Ephes.</hi> 1. 23. and 4. 4. and 5. 30.
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21.]</p>
            <p>10. <q>That Jesus Christ is so conferred
upon us, as to be our Advocate, (with the
Father) and that he commandeth us in
our Prayers to present our selves (or Pray)
to the Father in his Name.</q>
            </p>
            <p>11. <q>That God will have the World
Ruled (and restrained) by Laws and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Government, and therefore he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
Kings and Common-wealths, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinds of Principalities, whether He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary,
or otherwise, (<hi>i. e.</hi> as it pleaseth
him) and also what pertaineth to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of Justice, whereof he himself
is the Author, therefore hath he delivered
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58916:57"/>
the Sword (<hi>i. e.</hi> of Justice) into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>12. <q>That also much Honour and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
ought to be given to them as unto
God's Officers, and due Obedience yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto their Laws, and Tribute, and
Taxes paid, and the Yoke of Subjection
born, if the Magistrates be Infidels, so that
the <hi>Soveraign Government of God be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have abstracted divers of the most
material passages out of the Citation before,
of the <hi>French Protestants</hi> Confession of Faith,
which he has set forth an Abstract of, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the first Volume of <hi>J. Quick</hi>'s <hi>History,
Synod. in Gal. Reform.</hi> p. 6, to 15. Note, that
in the second and fourth Article the word
<hi>Persons</hi> is left out, and that for the more
plainness, a few <hi>Parenthesis</hi>'s (some begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with <hi>i. e.</hi>) are added, (and the ninth
altered more into Scripture words) in this
Abstract, which I am perswaded (as they
are sincerely owned by me) may be freely
owned, assented unto, and signed by most
<hi>Quakers</hi> (so call'd) in <hi>England,</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
consequently so far from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thereunto, or to all other Christians,
either in Principles or Practices, as <hi>F. B.</hi>
has most falsly and slanderously Misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and Aspersed them; The Lord (if it
be his Will) give him to see and confess his
great Injustice and Injury before he Dies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:58916:57"/>
But a little further, to pursue his base
and false Dealing.</p>
            <p>27. <hi>F. B.</hi> again very abusively and falsly
quotes <hi>E. Burrouogh</hi>'s Works thus, <hi>viz. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Water-Baptism,</hi> p. 518. <hi>We utterly deny,
and do say, it is no Ordinance of God, but it is
an Institution of the Whore of</hi> Rome, <hi>and</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>received it by a Popish Institution,</hi> &amp;c.
p. 44.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> Which base Perversion and Abuse
is evidently Refuted in <hi>The Quakers Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
p. 2. Col. 1, 2. thus, <q>This is very
partially and unjustly Cited, and in the
first words falsly; for <hi>E. Burroughs</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
in the very place is thus, <hi>viz.</hi> As
for Baptism and the Supper of the Lord,
we do own it, and it is practised of us in
the Life and Power of God; but as for
your Baptism, that is to say, SPRINK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LING
INFANTS, calling it <hi>the Baptism
into the Faith,</hi> and that they are made Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church thereby, and that it <hi>is
a Seal of Regeneration,</hi> as you say, [these
foregoing words <hi>Bugg</hi> leaves out] that we
do utterly deny, and do say it is no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God; neither was it ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by him, or practised by his Saints,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> [thus <hi>F. B.</hi> before Cited <hi>E. B.</hi>] But
again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> 
               <q>Here he did not say, that <hi>Water-Baptism</hi>
(without distinction) is a Popish
Institution, but objected against <hi>Sprinkling
Infants,</hi> and calling it <hi>the Baptism into the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58916:58"/>
Faith,</hi> &amp;c. for he knew that <hi>Water Baptism</hi>
it self was practised by <hi>John the Baptist,</hi>
(by special Commission from Heaven pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to him and his Ministry) and also
in the Apostle's time by some of them, long
before the Pope was.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s gross Perversion and
Abuse in this and many other things, (too
numerous now to recite) are notorious and
shameful; the Lord the Righteous Judge
(to whom we commit our Cause) humble
this Adversary, if it be his Blessed Will;
and let all others among us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from his woful and lamentable Backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and Fall.</p>
            <p>Let one most Scandalous and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Calumny be yet further Remarked,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fr. Bugg</hi>'s repeated Charge against the
<hi>Quakers, viz.</hi> these <hi>Contemptible Expressions,</hi>
as <hi>calling the Scriptures Beastly Ware,</hi>
&amp;c. as before;<note place="margin">☞</note> and the like we are
Charged with in that most malicious
wicked Piece, <hi>The Snake in the Grass,</hi> where
divers gross Calumnies are broached from
<hi>Bugg</hi>'s Authority and Credit.</p>
            <p>I having examined that Book out of which
the said Expressions have been pretended to
be taken, Entituled, <hi>A Brief Discovery of a
Threefold state of Antichrist,</hi> Printed <hi>Anno</hi>
1633. p. 9. I find no such gross Expressions
as calling the Scriptures <hi>Beastly Ware,</hi> but
divers severe Reflections upon the <hi>Covetous,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58916:58"/>
Persecuting Priests</hi> in those Days, then writ
by some Prisoners at <hi>York-Castle,</hi> 1653. and
what's there called <hi>Beastly Ware</hi> is not the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> but what <hi>Babylon</hi>'s <hi>Merchants sell
for a large Price,</hi> i. e. <hi>a Rabble of Notions
heaped up in their Brain all the Week, and which
they sell for filthy lucre's sake,</hi> &amp;c. calling
them also, <hi>Idol-Merchants, Costly Sermon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,
who Persecuted the pure Truth the
Saints live in, p.</hi> 9, 10. of the said <hi>Brief
Discovery;</hi> but not a word of calling the
<hi>Scriptures themselves Beastly Ware;</hi> and I am
perswaded such Blasphemy and Contempt of
Holy Scripture was far from the Thoughts
of those said Prisoners, and that which they
would have abominated and rejected with
Abhorrence, if they had then been Charg'd
therewith.</p>
            <p>Thus the Perversion and Injury done by
<hi>F. B. &amp;c.</hi> in this Matter is apparent, in his
putting <hi>Mens dark Notions</hi> for the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
The said Prisoners called <hi>Babylon</hi>'s
Merchants <hi>Rabble of Notions, Beastly Ware;
but F. B.</hi> says it is <hi>the Scriptures</hi> which they
so call; what a shameful Liar and Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is this! He pretends to prove <hi>W. Penn
a Liar for once, p. 38. Brief History.</hi> But
'tis more true, that he is more than once,
yea, often prov'd a <hi>Liar,</hi> and gross Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of others; and that his pretended <hi>Pious
Endeavours</hi> (by you his Approvers and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
aforesaid) are proved very <hi>Impious,</hi>
and you may Answer for him, and Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58916:59"/>
him, if you please, or can, since you
have given him such high Approbation and
Congratulation, which he has divulged to
your Disgrace; for <hi>F. B</hi>'s Answering by
repeating Calumnies and Slanders against
us, will deserve little further notice, since
so often unanswerably Confuted already;
and if you his Approvers, will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to attempt his Vindication, as
well as Approbation, nor yet shew any
publick dislike of his Abuses, scandalous
and reproachful Scribling, but leave him
to his own Vindication, and farther to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
us, we may take it as an Indication,
that you are Conscious his Defaming Work
is not justifiable nor warrantable in the sight
of God, or Just Men, and that you have
over-shot your selves in his Approbation;
and the more guilty your selves in suffering
Sin to lye upon him, without just Reproof
suitable to his publick Offence and Crime
against Truth: But if you will be mute in
this Matter, and suffer him to persist in his
wonted Course of Vilifying and Abusing us,
without your publick Reprehension or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
thereof, then may you be farther justly
called in question, and Exposed thereupon
for your neglect of Justice.</p>

            <p>2. Out of what Book was it Read to <hi>G.

them, and forming an Address for us

does vex and fret this our Implacable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
seeing his many Attempts, and

how sordid, brutish and unnatural it
was in <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> so strenuously to labour to
prevent the <hi>Quakers</hi> Relief in the Case of
Oaths, [since he Married his Son into an
Honest Family of <hi>Quakers</hi> (so called) and
appeared very officious (as I am credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed)

As to our Christian Confession of Christ,
his <hi>Divinity and Humanity, and his Glorious
Body in Heaven,</hi> we have sufficiently and
sincerely evinced according to Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
against this Adversary, and other
Opposers, which they are not able to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute,
knowing also that we are not necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to give farther Answer to his Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
Questions, especially since his Work
is so much falsly to Accuse and Asperse us
with sly and unjust Insinuations, to render
us Offensive and Obnoxious to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Besides, One Fool may ask more
Questions than Twenty Wise Men may An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p>To <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Paper, Stiled, <hi>A Brief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi>
which with the other before-mentioned,
he having delivered at the House of Lords,
which one of them gave me.</p>
            <p>His false Charge of <hi>our Contempt of Christ,
and the Scriptures,</hi> being Answered and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
before, in several Answers to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Books and Pamphlets, he proceeds
in his wonted Course of Perversion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming
still, for which he frequently quotes
his own Presumptuous Authority, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
Pamphlets.</p>
            <p>As to his offence at the Words he Cites
of <hi>an Imagined God beyond the Stars, and
their Carnal Christ.</hi> We say, First, The
True Infinite and Omnipresent God, tho'
in Heaven above, yet is not confined
or limitted to beyond the Stars, nor
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58916:61"/>
can the Heaven of Heavens contain Him.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>True Lord Jesus Christ</hi> who A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
<hi>far above all Heavens, that he might
fill all things,</hi> He is not a Carnal Christ, but
a Spiritual and most Glorious Christ, in
Soul, Spirit, and Body; therefore to deem
or call him a Carnal Christ, (which I know
none among us do) is so far to undervalue
his Glory and Dignity, that it appears no
less than Blasphemy; and how <hi>F. B.</hi> will
clear himself thereof, I know not.</p>
            <p>His Charge against the <hi>Quakers, That they
cannot Sign the Association, and thereby Declare
the King Rightful and Lawful King for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Consequence is a Gross and Envious
Perversion, and Contradicted by his own
following Confession, <hi>viz. And yet they tell
you, that their not signing it, is not in opposition
to his being Declared Rightful and Lawful
King:</hi> But then to invalidate this, he que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
<hi>Who says so?</hi> No Body; that's false,
for his words, <hi>they tell you,</hi> imply some
Body; but <hi>from what Meeting?</hi> Answer,
An Approved Meeting, by the People called
<hi>Quakers,</hi> whom he vilifies to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not <hi>from Two or Three</hi> Quakers
<hi>under the Hedge, as he scoffs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That we never made an Address to His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

several, and that with Real Gratitude too,

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I did not Impeach the <hi>Quakers</hi> for not
paying Tythes, <hi>though that be Crime enough,</hi>
but your Yearly Meeting for Imposing the
non-payment of Tythes upon your People,
and that too as a grand Oppression, and
Antichristian Yoke; and I say again, for
you to meet Annually by way of Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
TO make and promulgate such Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magistratical
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58916:62"/>
Laws, not only against, but
contray to the Laws of the Land, is both
against the King's Prerogative, the Rights
of Parliaments, and Property of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
yea, and of dangerous Consequence.
And I say again, that by these your Canon
Laws, you do Actually Absolve the King's
Subjects (if the <hi>Quakers</hi> may be so called)
from their Active Obedience to the Laws
of the Land, which requires them to pay
Tythes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Note, Reader, he has here added the
word <hi>Antimagistratical,</hi> and left out <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi>
before the word <hi>Laws,</hi> in his first
Presumptuous Impeachment also, as if he
would render us not only guilty of Sedition
in our said Meeting, but of High-Treason.</p>
            <p>He most maliciously and virulently ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates
his said Impeachment, p. 4. in
Charging the <hi>Quakers</hi> with <q>A New Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
lately Erected by a <hi>few Vsurpers,</hi>
who hold a Convention Annually at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
by way of Convocation, TO make
Laws and Ordinances contrary and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Laws and Statutes of the
Realm, which tend to <hi>Subvert the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and if not timely prevented, may be
of dangerous Consequence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Which Presumptuous Impeachment (as
'tis pretended <hi>in Behalf of the Commons of
England)</hi> contains divers gross Lies in't:
As, 1. That we meet Annually either with
any such Intention or Design, as TO Make,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58916:63"/>
Contrive, Promulgate and Impose <hi>Antima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistratical
Laws and Ordinances,</hi> either <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King's Prerogative, Rights of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
or Property of the Subjects,</hi> is a foul,
notorious, bloody, persecuting Calumny,
and contrary to both our Innocent Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Design of our Meeting.</p>
            <p>2. A New Jurisdiction lately Erected by
a few Usurpers, are both gross and horrid
Lies, for our Annual Meetings have been of
many years standing, with the general
Approbation of our People, for <hi>the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
our Christian Society, Charity, Order,
Discipline and Testimony,</hi> which our Lord
Jesus Christ has gathered us into, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of us.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>To make Laws against the King's Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
and Rights of Parliaments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Subvert the Government,</hi> which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
appears not only highly Seditious,
but highly Treasonable: This is both a
highly false, persecuting and bloody Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
tending also to incense and stir up
severe and bloody Persecution against us.
Oh horrid, cruel and inhumane!</p>
            <p>But if upon a Judicial Examination of his
said Presumptuous <hi>Impeachment,</hi> as being
<hi>in the Name or Behalf of the Commons of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
it be found both unwarrantable, and
a high Misdemeanour, and repugnant to
the Rights and Priviledges of Parliaments,
in him to Assume such a Power and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
without any Priviledge, either as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58916:63"/>
Member of Parliament, or any Commission
or Power from the Parliament; if to excuse
this presumption, he should alledge, That
<hi>'twas but a Jest, Romance, or Mock Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
as he has excused his <hi>Mock-Trial, and
Mock-Pillory,</hi> (as he calls it) whereon he
exposed Twelve Persons, and Citizens of
<hi>London,</hi> of good Reputation and Credit,
under the Character, Reproach and Scandal
of <hi>Perjury,</hi> at this rate he may take the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to Reproach, <hi>Defame</hi> and <hi>Scandalize</hi>
any Consciencious and Peaceable Subjects,
with the most Enormous or Heinous
Crimes in the World, and that with the
highest Malice and Virulency he can, to
Ruin, Destroy, and Murther them in their
Reputations, Persons, and Estates, and then
pretend 'twas but <hi>in Jest or Mockery.</hi> But
then see what <hi>Cruel Mocking</hi> he takes liberty
to, and what a <hi>Cruel Mocker</hi> he is; And
how unlike a <hi>Christian Convert,</hi> or Moral
Man, he acts, and yet divers of his near
Relations are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and in Society
with the same People, who he has so Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously,
Injuriously and Foully Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
and Charged, as before: Oh Unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
Brutish and Cruel Mocker!</p>
            <p>One great Complaint is, That <hi>for his</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
a Mock-Pillory, they Indicted him at the
Old-Bailey, London, p. 3. Who were they
Indicted him? 'Twas not the Persons gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scandalized by his <hi>Mock-Trial, and Mock-Pillory,</hi>
for hitherto they have been very
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58916:64"/>
Patient and Merciful to him, in that they
have not as yet entered their Actions of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation
severally against him, according
to his Demerits, as also in that they did not
assent to have him Prosecuted by other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that would have done it in a Higher
Court.</p>
            <p>The Advice given in our Yearly Meeting's
Epistle to our Friends, That <hi>their Sufferings</hi>
(<hi>i. e.</hi> for Conscience sake) <hi>be duly gathered,
truly entered and kept,</hi> implies their Passive
Obedience to the Government, wherein
they cannot for Conscience sake actively
Obey, consequently <hi>no Sedition,</hi> nor Design
of <hi>Subversion</hi> to the Government on our
Parts, either in the said Meeting or Epistles.
Which said Epistles are no Impositions a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
falsly Charged, being Recommended to our
own Friends, as <hi>Concurring</hi> with their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Testimony, received not from Men,
Assemblies, or Humane Contrivance, but
from Jesus Christ; as is our Christian Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
against that known Oppression of
Tythes, as Claimed, (and with severe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution)
Imposed by divers of the Clergy,
which renders them not only a Burthen or
Yoke, but the more against Christ, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
is; tho' our great Offence to this
Mocker is, to deem Tythes now Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
we mean, 1. Because Abolished by
Jesus Christ. 2. <hi>Ab Origine, (i. e.</hi> since
ended by Christ) as Imposed by the Pope
and his Clergy. 3. As Imposed and Forced
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58916:64"/>
with <hi>severe Persecution, Imprisonment, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questrations
and Seizures by</hi> Pretended <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Christ;</hi> contrary also to his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10 8. as well as to
his true Ministers Example. 4. Contrary
also to the sincere Testimony of divers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Protestants, and their Martyrs,
who were both Men of Good Fame, Piety,
and Learning, as was <hi>John Wickcliff,
William Swinderby, Walter Brute, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Thorpe,</hi> and the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> with
others mentioned in the Book of Martyrs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> did bear Testimony against the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the Popish Clergy, and against
Tythes, and Compelled Maintenance, by
the Civil Authority, and this of their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Tythes was made a principal Article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them by the <hi>Papists,</hi> as more largely
appears in the first Volume of Martyrs, in
the Reigns of <hi>Richard</hi> II. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and
<hi>Henry</hi> V.</p>
            <p>To this the Mocker gives us but a very
slim Answer, and poor <hi>Come-off,</hi> viz. <hi>By
which you seem to make no difference between a</hi>
Popish <hi>and</hi> Protestant <hi>Clergy, for which the
Church of</hi> England <hi>will not thank you,</hi> p. 1.</p>
            <p>Pray observe what a silly Argument this
is, as if that which is a Sin, and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
in <hi>Papists,</hi> were not a Sin in such <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
who are guilty of the same Fact;
but testified against by true <hi>Protestants</hi> and
<hi>Martyrs,</hi> and yet therein no Contrivers of
<hi>Sedition or Conspiracy to Subvert the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:58916:65"/>
as in effect we are Injuriously Accused
by this Cruel Mocker, the principal Article
of his Charge (or Impeachment) being
that of deeming Tythes (as now Claimed
by Priests) <hi>Antichristian</hi> (or against Christ)
although for this we Cited both <hi>John Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff</hi>
in particular, and <hi>William Thorpe</hi> also
more at large, who expresly saith, <hi>Those
Priests that will Challenge or Take Tythes, deny
that Christ is come in the Flesh,</hi> [which to do
☞ is Antichristian.] Did not <hi>William Thorpe</hi>
deem them Antichristian then? And has
not this Mocker then, like the <hi>Papists,</hi> Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
these Martyrs (and others) Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
as tending to <hi>Sedition and Subversion of
the Government,</hi> as well as he has done by
the <hi>Quakers?</hi> But the Cruel Mocker mutely
gives the <hi>Go-by</hi> to <hi>William Thorp</hi>'s Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and <hi>John Wickcliff</hi>'s also, against endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Priests with Tythes, and Temporal Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,
largely Cited against him in our
Answer to his Impeachment, p. 2, 3, 4.
All this he silently passes by, and instead of
entering into the Merits of the Cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
he repeats and aggravates his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
and Charge with Persecuting
Invectives, fleeing to, and preferring <hi>the
Secular Power to Christ's Power,</hi> and <hi>Humane
Law</hi> to <hi>Christ's Law,</hi> as <hi>what is made Law at</hi>
Westminster, <hi>is made Vnlawful at your Yearly
Meeting, yea, a Grand Oppression and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Yoak; and as such, you Charge and
Command your People not to pay Tythes,</hi> p. 2.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58916:65"/>
But where we do so Charge and Command
he shews us not, we find it not in our Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
which he grounds his Impeachment
upon: He Argues not like a Christian, but
like a Temporizing Persecutor, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a <hi>Humane Law</hi> to <hi>Christ's Law:</hi> If
Tythes were Abolisht by Christ's Law, as
the said Martyrs Argue, who therein were
not guilty of Sedition or Treason, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
Christ's Prerogative, and his Law,
to all Temporal Power and Laws.</p>
            <p>His Accusing me with <hi>refusing to meet him
according to my Proposal,</hi> p. 9. and saying, <hi>I
find</hi> G. W. <hi>will not come forth himself, he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Fate of</hi> Hungate <hi>the Jesuit against</hi> Hall,
p. 11. are both notoriously false, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is well known; first, <hi>G. W.</hi> earnestly
pressed for a meeting with him according
to his own Proposal, which was, <q>To make
it appear before any Six, Ten, or Twelve
Competent WITNESSES, who are Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
Men of Sence and Common Reason,
that <hi>Fr. Bugg</hi> has grosly Abused and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Truth, and Wronged the People
called <hi>Quakers,</hi> both in Charge, Citation,
and Observation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> (and this is all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proved against him, in the afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Answers quoted in the Preface) and
which Proposal <hi>G. W.</hi> never declined, but
<hi>F. B</hi> has evaded and perverted it. Instead
of so many <hi>Witnesses</hi> to bear Witness to
what passed, he's for the <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
of so many Episcopalians, Presbyterians,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58916:66"/>
Independents and Bapists, whose Hand</hi> (he
confesseth) <hi>is against</hi> G. W<hi>'s Impeachment,</hi>
p. 2. So that <hi>F. B.</hi> would not be content
with their being <hi>Witnesses</hi> only, as <hi>G. W.</hi>
proposed, but must have them <hi>Judges for
Decision,</hi> that he might be sure aforehand to
have <hi>G. W.</hi> Condemned by a Party, against
and contrary to him, even in some Points of
Doctrine concerned in the Difference, yet
would have <hi>G. W.</hi> submit to their Judgment
and Decision, or else no meeting with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Witnesses</hi> as proposed by <hi>G. W.</hi> would not
be accepted, but <hi>Judges for Decision,</hi> which
was to pre-engage <hi>G. W.</hi> to submit, and
give away his <hi>Religion, Faith,</hi> and <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
aforehand, to Persons of different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
(Oh sad! Oh dark! Oh irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Witness!) yet if esteemed Moderate,
the more fit to be Witnesses of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
than Judges or Lords over <hi>G. W.</hi> his
<hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> who dare trust them
with the former, but may not submit to the
latter. As also the Evidence of any Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Men, tho' of different Perswasions,
might be trusted to decide whether <hi>F. B.</hi>
had rightly and truly Cited and Quoted the
right Book and Page; but whether he had
thence fairly observed the true Sence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
this would include some Matters of
Doctrine and Conscience, wherein <hi>G. W.</hi>
and all true Christians, refuse to be Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon by opposite Parties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:58916:66"/>
To pass by many of <hi>F. B</hi>'s foul Aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and cruel Mockings; in p. 4. he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
both mine and <hi>Isaac Penington</hi>'s Words
and Intentions; as where in <hi>Counterfeit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,</hi>
p. 72. I said, <q>I may see cause other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to word the Matter, and yet <hi>our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi>
be the same;</q> whereupon <hi>F. B.</hi>
thus observes, <hi>viz. The English of which is,
though</hi> Is. Penington <hi>deny Jesus of</hi> Nazareth
<hi>to be Christ, and make</hi> HIM <hi>but a Vail, a
Garment,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and</hi> G. W. <hi>confess him to be
Christ, yet they mean all one thing,</hi> ONLY <hi>a
Garment. And the Light that was therein
Crucified, is the Christ,</hi> p. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Here are Four Falshoods in this
Observation, 1. That <hi>Is. Penington</hi> denies
Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be Christ; we find
not that denial in his Works. 2. That he
makes HIM BUT <hi>a Vail, a Garment,</hi> &amp;c.
This is not so spoken by <hi>Is. Penington</hi> of <hi>Him,</hi>
(<hi>i. e.</hi> the Intire Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> or Son
of God) but of his <hi>Flesh</hi> which he took on
him, called the <hi>Vail</hi> by the Apostle himself,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 20. wherein he does not call <hi>Jesus
Christ</hi> himself <hi>but a Vail</hi> or <hi>Garment.</hi> 3. That
<hi>Is. Penington</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> mean that Jesus <hi>is
only a Garment,</hi> is a foul Perversion, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so intended by either. 4. Or that they
mean, '<hi>twas the Light that was therein that was
Crucified, and only is the Christ.</hi> This also is
an absurd Consequence and Perversion, for
they mean that Christ was Crucified accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Flesh, that he was put to Death
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58916:67"/>
as concerning the Flesh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. which
his Spirit or Light within could not be,
therefore the <hi>one thing</hi> G. W. and Is. P. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
or mean, is neither to deny Jesus of
<hi>Nazareth</hi> to be Christ, nor that <hi>he</hi> is <hi>only</hi>
a Garment, as both are unjustly Charged;
and 'tis to be observed how <hi>F. B</hi>'s Friend,
<hi>George Keith,</hi> has Contradicted and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him in this very Charge in his <hi>Serious
Appeal,</hi> Printed but in 1692. against <hi>Cotton
Mather,</hi> p. 25, 26. in these words. <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>But because he cannot fix his false Charge
upon me of denying Christ, he Essayeth
(but with as ill Success) to fix it upon
my Brethren, as Dear <hi>Isaac Penington,</hi>
whom I well knew to be a true Believer
in the Lord Jesus Christ, and whose Soul I
believe is in Rest in Christ, in Heavenly
Glory. And as to his words, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
call the bodily Garment Christ, but
that which appeared and dwelt in the Body.
It is easie to put a fair and charitable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
on it, as well as on Christ's
words, when he said, <hi>He that hath seen me,
hath seen the Father,</hi> and yet many saw
Christ's Body of Flesh, that never saw the
Father. But to clear this thing, <hi>I. P.</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
this in opposition to <hi>Socinians,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Tinctur'd with <hi>Socinian</hi> Principles;
as if the Manhood of Christ that was Born
of the Virgin, excluding the Eternal Word,
was the only and whole Christ, whereas
Christ was before his Body of Flesh, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58916:67"/>
he is said to have come <hi>in</hi> the Flesh,
and to have taken Flesh;<note n="*" place="margin">

and if we consider Christ as he
was before the World was,
by whom all things were
Created; and in respect of his Godhead,
the Body was not that, but the Garment of
it when he assumed it. But when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
Christ as Man, as every other Man
hath both Soul and Body belonging to his
Essential Constitution as Man, so had
Christ, and still hath, a most Glorious
Soul and Body.</q>

            <p>Observe now how Charitably and Plainly

            <p>Among those called <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi>
which he accuseth <hi>G. F.</hi> with <hi>assuming to

            </p>
            <p>1. Who is the Son of God.</p>
            <p>2. I was in the Paradice of God.</p>
            <p>3. That it was Christ the Eternal Power
of God, that spake in me at that time unto
them.</p>
            <p>4. Pretended Miracles wrought in his

            <p>5. He that hath the same Spirit that raised

            <p>Which with other pretended Instances
partially and perversly pickt up, this Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
terms <hi>a few Instances of Blasphemy.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>1. To the first, If <hi>G. F.</hi> said, <hi>Who is the
Son of God,</hi> (which should rather have been
<hi>a Son of God</hi>) yet therein he did not say,
<hi>That he himself is the only begotten Son of God,</hi>
that Eminent Title belongs <hi>only to Christ;</hi>
for was not <hi>Adam</hi> called <hi>The Son of God?
Luke</hi> 3. 38. Was this then Blasphemy?
How Ignorant is this Mocker of Scripture
Language?</p>
            <p>2. To the second, It was no Blasphemy
to say, he was in the Paradice of God, no
more than to say, he was a Man in Christ;
for so said <hi>Paul,</hi> yet no Blasphemer,
2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:58916:68"/>
3. It is no Blasphemy to say, That Christ,
or the Spirit of Christ, speaketh in or
through his Ministers and Servants, for
both he and they so testified. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.
19. 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 3. Mark 13. 11. Luke</hi> 12. 11.</p>
            <p>4. 'Tis a notorious Lie also, <hi>That</hi> G. F.
<hi>pretended Miracles wrought in his own Name
only;</hi> for he ascribed them not to himself,
but to the Power of God and his Motion, to
whom he frequently prayed for the Sick
and Diseased, upon which the Lord resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
some; to him therefore <hi>G. F.</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Praise. See his <hi>Journ.</hi> p. 103, 170,
171, 407.</p>
            <p>5. The fifth Instance, as 'tis worded, is
disown'd, and we do not believe that <hi>G. F.</hi>
ever said this of himself, but that he's
wrong'd herein. See what <hi>G. Keith</hi> saith
to it contrary to <hi>F. B. Serious Appeal,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
<hi>Cotton,</hi> p. 60. <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>And whereas he
would in the Conclusion fix it upon <hi>G. F.</hi>
that he thought himself <hi>Equal</hi> with God,
and that the Soul of Man was God, or a
part of him: But seeing he bringeth not
this from <hi>G. F.</hi> but from <hi>Faldo,</hi> a most
Partial and Envious Adversary, it is not to
be regarded; and <hi>W. Penn</hi> hath sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Vindicated <hi>G. F.</hi> and also <hi>G. F.</hi> hath
cleared it in his Book, that he did Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
both the Son and the Holy Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in him, who (as he taketh notice
by the <hi>Westminster</hi> Confessions Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
are Equal to God the Father.</q> What
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58916:69"/>
says <hi>F. B.</hi> to this Vindication? The rest of
his Aspersions are Answered in the aforesaid
Answers.</p>
            <p>As to the Account, and severe Characters
<hi>F. B.</hi> gives in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Name against
False Ministers and Ministry, p. 7, 8. this
he has scraped, and patch'd up, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and reiterated over and over, in most
of his Pamphlets against us, and will needs
have it, that therein the <hi>Quakers</hi> reproach
<hi>the Ministers of the Gospel, Christ's Ministers,</hi>
p. 10. which we positively deny; and 'tis
wholly without proof, and what he cannot
prove, <hi>i. e.</hi> that we reproach <hi>Christ's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
in Testifying against <hi>Covetous Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Priests,</hi> who make a Trade of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and of the Scriptures, and such whom
the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> called greedy dumb Dogs,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 10, 11. How will <hi>F. B.</hi> prove such
Christ's Ministers, or Gospel Ministers?
We have but his bare say-so for it, but want
proof for it, wherein he does but meerly
impose upon us, to Vilifie us, and Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
himself into Favour with that sort of the
Clergy, who are most Guilty of the Sin of
Covetousness and Persecution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mocker</hi> again repeats his false and
empty Boast by way of Question, p. 12.
<hi>viz. Why then will you not bring forth</hi> Sheba <hi>the
Son of</hi> Bichri, <hi>the Man of</hi> Belial, G. W? <hi>Is
there not a wise Man amongst you?</hi> His Cruel
Mocking and Calumny in this unjust Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
is denied; no doubt his Malice is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58916:69"/>
cruel and deadly enough to bring <hi>G. W.</hi> to
<hi>Sheba</hi>'s End, if he had Power, or could
with any Colour or Pretence bring him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Sheba</hi>'s Crime of Treason, <hi>or lifting up
his Hand against the King,</hi> 2 Sam. 20. 21, 22.
For doth not this Mocker's Language, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
and Treatment of this kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak
his deadly Malice and Design?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He goes on with his empty boasting,</hi> viz.
<hi>He tells you, That I</hi> wrong the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
in Charge, Citation, and Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
☞Bring him forth according to his
Proposal, and you will see it proved that I have
not.</p>
            <p>As it was <hi>G. W</hi>'s part to make good his
Proposal or Charge against <hi>F. B.</hi> so he
hath greatly endeavoured a Meeting with
<hi>F. B.</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> before Witnesses, for the
same purpose, but evaded by <hi>F. B.</hi> on other
Terms than were in the said Proposal, as is
before related: Now he has no cause to cry,
<hi>Bring him forth according to his Proposal!</hi> For
that is abundantly proved in the Answers
before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas</hi> F. B. <hi>further boasts,</hi> G. W.
hath wrote to divers Clergy-men, to prevail with
me to desist; they give me his Letters, and wish
me good Success, <hi>p.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>The Clergy-men which <hi>G. W.</hi> wrote to,
were <hi>William Smithies</hi> of <hi>Cripplegate, London;</hi>
and <hi>Isaac Archer</hi> of <hi>Milden-hall,</hi> in <hi>Suffolk;</hi>
which was to shew them some of his foul
Abuses and Calumnies, to try them (as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58916:70"/>
a particular Interest in him) if they
would stop him: Why did he not Print <hi>G.
W</hi>'s Letters to them, and to himself too al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so?
But thereby his Abuses, and sorry eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Shifting, would have been the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.
Wherefore seeing he boasts of
their <hi>wishing him good Success,</hi> these Two
Questions are put to you the said <hi>William
Smithies</hi> and <hi>Isaac Archer,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. Do you really Approve of his

            <head type="sub">An Appendix to the foregoing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
in Certain Positions
of the Sincere Belief, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrine of the People of
God called Quakers, in Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Misrepresentations
and Calumnies of F. Bugg (and
other Apostates) in his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
History of the Quakers, and
other his and their Books and
Pamphlets.</head>
            <p>1. WE, the said People, are bound in
Conscience and Duty by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, and Light of Christ Jesus, only
and humbly to Adore and Worship the only
True and Living God, Creator of Heaven
and Earth, the Sea, and all Creatures, and
not to Adore or Worship any Mortal Man,
or Creature, or any other God whatsoever.</p>
            <p>2. To Believe and Confess the Holy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Three (or Scripture Trinity) that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58916:71"/>
bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the
Word, (or Son) and Holy Spirit, and that
these Three are Essentially One in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Substance, One God, Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for Ever.</p>
            <p>3. We are livingly taught and led by
the Light and Spirit of Christ Jesus, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Word in our Hearts, (and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Holy Scripture) to Believe,
Own and Confess the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of Jesus
Christ, that is, his Real Coming in the
Flesh without us; even the same Jesus of
<hi>Nazareth</hi> that was Conceived in the Virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> by the Power of the Holy Ghost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowing
her, and Born of her <hi>in</hi> Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem
of Judea, Mat. 2. 1. and that he was
Crucified, and put to Death, as concerning
the Flesh without the Gates of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi>
and we highly do Value and Esteem his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
Death, Precious Blood, and whole
Sacrifice for Sinners; together with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
and Ascension into Heaven and
Glory; and that he only was and is the
Promised <hi>Messias,</hi> the Very Christ, the <hi>Only</hi>
Begotten Son of the Living God: And as
for his <hi>Divinity,</hi> That he is the True Light,
Life, Power and Wisdom of God, and none
other, according to plain Scripture Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> (i. e.
<hi>Manhood</hi>) of Christ Jesus, that as he is
True God, and as he is most Glorious Man,
our Mediator and Advocate, we livingly
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58916:71"/>
Believe, and have often sincerely Confessed
in our Publick Testimonies and Writings.</p>
            <p>5. That as sincere and fervent Prayers to
God in the Name and Spirit of Christ Jesus,
is the Duty of all True Believers and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
professing him, for whatsoever they
stand in need of, especially with respect to
the Peace and Happiness of their Immortal
Souls; so all who are truly humbled under
a Sence of their Sins, in order to true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Conversion, ought to crave
Forgiveness in the Name, and for the Sake
of Christ Jesus, which hath been our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
both Publick and Private, and God
in Mercy hath accordingly answered us,
who by his Grace in our Hearts, hath led
many, both to confess and forsake Sin, that
they might find Mercy in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>6. Though we are bound in Conscience
truly to Esteem and Magnifie the Divine
Light, the Ingrafted Word, the Spirit and
Power of Christ in us, as sufficient and able
actually to save and deliver the Soul, from
Sin, Death, and Condemnation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we Confess <hi>the Man Christ Jesus</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to his entire Existence or <hi>Being,</hi> as
<hi>without</hi> us, as well as we do own him Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
<hi>within</hi> us; knowing that this Light,
Life, and Spirit of Christ Jesus, Testifie of
him, and certainly Guides the truly Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
and Sincere Believers, in his Name
and Power, Inwardly, Livingly, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally,
to partake of the Real Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58916:72"/>
Fruits, and Blessed Ends of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Suffering, Sacrifice, and Death for
Mankind, to wit, their Repentance, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
from Sin, Effectual Reconciliation
unto God, Eternal Salvation, and Compleat
Redemption, which Christ Jesus has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for us, (<hi>i. e.</hi> for all Mankind) thro'
his Mediation and Sufferings.</p>
            <p>7. Our Really Believing and Confessing
the Lord Jesus Christ, his Passion, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Death, Atonement, and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made <hi>for us,</hi> and his Resurrection, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension
and Glorification, (as without us)
according to Scripture, cannot be to Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorize
all these away, as if only transacted
within us, (as we have been unduly Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
for they were really done and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
without us, by our Blessed Lord Jesus
Christ, tho' our true Knowledge of the
Power of his Resurrection, and Fellowship
of his Sufferings, and our being Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his Death, must be Experienced
<hi>within us,</hi> if ever we Live or Reign with
Him.</p>
            <p>8. We sincerely Prefer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Esteem the
<hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old and New Testament,</hi>
contain'd in that Excellent Book, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
called the Bible, (as most Eminently
Confirmed by Divine Authority, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Witnesses) before all other Books what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
extant in the World; and yet our
preferring the Holy Spirit (from whence
the Scripture came), before the Letter of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58916:72"/>
the Scripture, is not to undervalue the
Scripture, for <hi>the Spirit</hi> must needs have the
Preference and Preheminence, as being the
Author, and Original Cause, and Dictator
of the Holy Scriptures, and Giver of Light
and Life also, whereby truly to understand
them, and to live accordingly.</p>
            <p>9. As for Baptism and the Lord's Supper,
they are Scripturally considered by us in
their several Dispensations, both as in the
<hi>Figure,</hi> and in the <hi>Substance,</hi> in the Type
and Antitype, as the Outward or Literal
were Typical or Figurative of the Inward
and Spiritual, we confess and own, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Places, and proper Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but the Substance is more Excellent
and Permanent than the Shadow; as the
Inward and Spiritual Grace is more Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than the Outward and Visible Signs;
and as Christ's Spiritual Baptism, which is
the Saving Baptism, was Typified by <hi>John</hi>'s.
And to Eat, and Drink, or Sup with Christ
in his Kingdom, of that Spiritual Meat and
Drink which he gives for Life to the Soul,
was Typified or Figured forth by his Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Supper of the Passover, Bread and
Cup; for the Outward Element of Water
cannot wash away Sin from the Soul, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the Outward Bread or Cup, give
Life or Nourishment to the Soul.</p>
            <p>The Shadows flee away, but the Sum and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
remain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:58916:73"/>
10. We sincerely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Believe, and have
often Confessed the Immortality of the
Soul of Man, that was Created in God's
Image, and the Doctrine of the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Dead,</hi> according as laid down
in Holy Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15th Chapter;
and of Eternal Judgment by Jesus Christ,
as being Judge of the Living, and of the
Dead, in the Great and Last Day of
Judgment, at the Great Harvest, which
is the End of the World, God having
appointed a Day wherein he will Raise
the Dead, both the Just and Unjust, and
also Judge the World in Righteousness,
by that (Heavenly and most Glorious)
Man Christ Jesus whom he hath Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. before whose Tribunal-Seat
all must appear, to Receive their
Final Judgment and Sentence, according
to their Deeds done in the Body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be Good or Evil.</p>
            <p>11. That Christ's Gospel Ministry must
be free, without forced Maintenance, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Lucre, or Covetousness.</p>
            <p>12. That Magistracy, or Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is God's Ordinance; the Good
Ends thereof being for the Punishment of
Evil Doers, and Praise of them that do
Well.</p>
            <p>These Things we Sincerely Believe and
Own; but, to do <hi>F. Bugg</hi> Right, we find
not that he has Charged us in the Tenth
Particular, about the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> though
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58916:73"/>
some other Apostates have: And we know
no other Doctrine or Principle, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

to these before-mentioned; nor do we
Own any contrary thereunto.</p>

<hi>Calumnies, Lies</hi> and <hi>Abuses,</hi> with short
<hi>Notes</hi> on them, as followeth.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In his</hi> Dedication <hi>to the</hi> Bishops <hi>of the</hi>
Church <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>whom he flatters thus,
viz.</hi> My Lords, I have not leisure to trace
them (i. e. <hi>the</hi> Quakers) in all their By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths
from the very beginning of their Rise, and
to shew, how they branched forth from the Seeds
of the <hi>Ranters, Levellers,</hi> and other <hi>Latitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:58916:74"/>
               <hi>Observe</hi> pray, herein he Imposeth a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totious
and Scandalous <hi>Falshood</hi> upon the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
it being well known, that the said
People, call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> as to their <hi>Rise,</hi>
sprung and branched forth from and out
of Religious Families of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> (so
called) and of the most sincere among those
called <hi>Independent, Anabaptist</hi> and <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Churches and Families, and others, and
not from the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Ranters,</hi> as he has
grosly defamed them, thereby Abusing both
<hi>Bishops,</hi> and other Readers.</p>
            <p>2. Their Contempt of the Scripture, as <hi>Beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Wares, p.</hi> 2. Calling them <hi>Beastly Ware,
p.</hi> 42. That the <hi>Quakers</hi> have Condemn'd the
Holy Scriptures, <hi>p.</hi> 48. That <hi>our</hi> Teachers
tell <hi>us,</hi> that the Scriptures are Dust, Death,
Beastly Ware, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 61. That their Chief
Work in their Meetings, as well as Writings,
was to lower the Power of the Magistrates, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Ministers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Bible,
Beastly Ware, <hi>&amp;c. p. 97. He further saith,</hi>
I know, if I had recommended the Scriptures,

            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> Thus he still shamefully Abuses
the <hi>Readers, Bishops,</hi> and others, by these
most gross repeated Blasphemous <hi>Calumnies,</hi>
manifestly Detected both in the foregoing
<hi>Expostulation,</hi> and other <hi>Answers</hi> to him.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58916:75"/>
So that he shamefully pleases himself with
frequent Repetition of his old, stinking,
loathsom <hi>Stuff</hi> to defame the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>That possibly</hi> our <hi>Women learn'd of</hi> my

Youth upwards.</p>

spring out of the <hi>Dregs</hi> of the People, as
<hi>Ranters,</hi> when first thou turnedst <hi>Quaker?</hi>
For shame, for shame leave off such sordid
Stuff.</p>
            <p>5. That the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny Christ, and that
their Doctrine teacheth to deny him to be
Christ, who was Born of the Virgin, and their
Contempt of <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> (Contents,
<hi>and p. 25, and</hi> 37.</p>

And our Confessing <hi>Christ</hi> IN <hi>us,

each other to wait in the feeling of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of a Deceas'd Brother, and call it, the

               <hi>Observe</hi> his Dulness and Stupidity in this
Lying Perversion: He distinguishes not
between the Saints <hi>Comforter,</hi> or Spirit of
Truth in a Deceas'd Brother, and his own
<hi>Spirit; i. e.</hi> between the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and
the <hi>Spirit</hi> of a <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. That it's very plain, that they (i. e. <hi>the</hi>
Quakers) put the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for the
T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Sun of Righteousness, they most Wretchedly
and Blasphemously attribute to <hi>G. Fox, p.</hi> 52.
And that the <hi>Quakers</hi> did <hi>BELIEVE,</hi> the
<hi>North</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was the Town of <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 53. That the <hi>Quakers</hi> give
Testimony to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> as the Branch, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi>
57, 58.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> What an Abominable Perversion
this <hi>Story</hi> is, though frequently repeated by
him, and detected by us, as hath been made
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58916:76"/>
Evident. His Stageing us in his Mock-Tryal,
Arraignment and Pillory, for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
Denying the same, is not sufficient
Abuse for us; but against all Truth and
plain Demonstration, he insolently insists
upon the same to defame us, like one har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
in his Iniquity, and Injurious <hi>Work</hi>
of <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Envy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. <hi>That Christ,</hi> that was Born in the City of
<hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> plainly say, This is not
the Christ, <hi>p. 58. [For which he quotes the</hi>
Christian Quaker, and his Divine Test.
<hi>p.</hi> 98.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> I have Examin'd the Page 98. in
both the first and second part of our said
Book, <hi>Christian Quaker,</hi> quoted by <hi>F. Bugg</hi>
here, in neither whereof do I find the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
saying, <hi>That this is not the Christ that was
Born in the City of</hi> David; but his <hi>Divinity</hi>
Asserted, and his Pre-existence before that
Outward Appearance or Coming of Christ
in the Flesh, that he was the Divine <hi>Word,</hi>
the <hi>Seed,</hi> the <hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Life,</hi> &amp;c. before
he took upon him that Body prepar'd for
him. See now how plainly and perversly
<hi>F. B.</hi> has Abused the <hi>Quakers</hi> in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>10. He scornfully repeats a known <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth</hi>
against me in these words, <hi>Dear</hi>
George, <hi>to save thy Bacon, can now do it,</hi>
[i. e. <hi>Swear</hi>] <hi>and that an Oath was read to</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:58916:76"/>
G. W. <hi>in open Court,</hi> April 9. 1695. <hi>and
the Book being put to his Mouth, he submitted to
it without gainsaying.</hi> p. 93.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> In good Conscience, I deny this <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
again; and many can Witness the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as to what Testimony I bore in
<hi>Court.</hi> Whoever was <hi>F. B</hi>'s <hi>Informer,</hi> I
shall not be much Inquisitive, I know my
own <hi>Innocency,</hi> and can demonstrate it, if it
were not to an Enemy, that labours to
Asperse me.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>That their Teachers in their Travels to
and fro, to seduce the People not only from the
Christian Religion, but from their Allegiance to
their Governours,</hi> p. 101.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> Which is a Malicious Lying <hi>Story,</hi>
unjustly designed to render us Obnoxious.</p>
            <p>12. He tells a false Story concerning a
<hi>Bishop and Mr.</hi> Whitehead, <hi>that the Bishop
said, they must insert a Clause for the Payment
of Tythes,</hi> &amp;c. meaning in the Bill for our
Relief in the Case of Oaths. Upon which
<hi>F. B.</hi> falsly Drols, <hi>But O Poor</hi> George, <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I see him how he rubb'd his Elbow, and
scratched his Head, and look'd up as demurely
as a Puritan,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hist.</hi> p. 117, 118.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> This whole Story, with the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Passages depending upon it, is wholly
false; for the Clause to Recover Tythes,
was past in the House of Commons before it
came up to the House of Lords.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:58916:77"/>
I have not time now to go through his
Repeated <hi>Calumnies, Lyes,</hi> and <hi>Abuses</hi> both
in his Monstrous deformed Picture (as I
may call it) <hi>of Quakerism;</hi> and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Brief History thereof,</hi> for they are
numerous.</p>
            <p>One thing more I may observe, how
<hi>F. B.</hi> presumes to prescribe and dictate to
the Government, from the Example of the
<hi>FRENCH KING,</hi> towards the <hi>French</hi>
Protestants, in the Year 1644. which he
takes out of <hi>John Quick's History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As to his <hi>Permitting the Protestant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
to hold a National Synod, and ordering
them a Commissioner to assist and be present
with them in their Synod.</hi> He cites the <hi>Writ</hi>
Signed <hi>LEWIS,</hi> and the <hi>Commissioner</hi>'s
Speech, and Synod's Answer. <hi>P.</hi> 97, 98,
99, 100, 101, 102.</p>
            <p>From whence <hi>F. B.</hi> takes upon him to
prescribe and dictate to the present King
and Government here, <hi>viz. That if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
think good to bestow that favour of
them</hi> (as to have <hi>Anniversary Synods) it
would be very proper, that there should be a
Commissioner or two, ordered by His Majesty
to Reside in their Counsel.</hi> And about 13
Precepts of <hi>F. B</hi>'s to the Government to
Restrain and Limit our Anniversary Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>P.</hi> 122. to <hi>P.</hi> 126. Whence 'ti ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
how he strives and insinuates to
perswade our Protestant Government, to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58916:77"/>
imitate the <hi>French</hi> King's Example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
As if the King and Government here
were as much fearful and jealous of his
peaceable Protestant Subjects, as the <hi>French</hi>
King was of the Protestants in <hi>France;</hi>
and what Reputation or Honour has he in
thus prescribing and dictating shewn to a
Protestant Government in <hi>England,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to learn of a <hi>French</hi> King, and
to imitate him in their Conduct?</p>
            <p>2. He also dictates, how to call us in
<hi>Question before Authority for our Books,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>P.</hi> 121. O busie Dictator! will nothing
serve him but Persecution (which he does
but sorrily define) or some Popish Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Inquisitions over us, to introduce
a new Persecution?</p>
            <p>Ah! poor <hi>Francis!</hi> my Soul pities thee,
tho' I have been plain with thee, may'st
thou yet be humbled unto Repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou dyest; for thy great Enmity,
thy manifold repeated Calumnies, notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Perversions, and Persecuting Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives!</p>
            <p>And you his <hi>Ministers,</hi> Approvers, and
Congratulators, (Expostulated with) <hi>J. A.
W. S.</hi> &amp;c. what think you of your Convert
<hi>F. B.</hi> his Work? Will it quit the Cost and
Pains, and be for your Reputation, or
Church's Service, to encourage him thus
to proceed in Scribling, and making Books,
stuff'd with Repetitions of his old, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worn,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58916:78"/>
thread-bare stuff, made up mostly
of the same reiterated, envious, and scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Aspersions, and Perversions, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Refuted, without any direct or rational
Reply from him; but instead thereof silly
Histories of the same repeated Calumnies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> imposed upon the World by your
Convert <hi>F. B.</hi> Alas! poor Man! what a
Whirl-pool is he fallen into? Do you think
he spends his Time or Estate well in such
invidious fruitless Work? Or do you help
him in the Charge? Pray consider of it, if
you please. I have observ'd, he is very
Industrious for you and your Interest, as
he may think. I have in one Sheet An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
a Book of his, (as I may) and with
that set his Windmil going again, to bring
forth another Book, of some Bulk and
Charge. But if he still thinks his said
<hi>Picture of Quakerism</hi> is drawn to the Life,
it should then be his <hi>Master-Piece,</hi> and save
him more Labour and Charge of Limning
against us. But if he can draw Pictures no
better than this, or his Picture of Quakers
in the Pillory, he had better give over the
Trade, and Study to be Quiet, that he may
Live and Die the more Quietly.</p>
