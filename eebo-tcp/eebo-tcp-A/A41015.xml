            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CHALLENGE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E catholikes say, that there is always one, and but one true, divine and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible faith professed by the church of Christ, without which none can please God, nor attain to salvation: this one true faith generally preached through the world was not to cease with the Apostles and their immediate hearers, but was by Christs promise to continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed to the worlds end. For so 'tis said <hi>(Mat. ult.)</hi> behold, <hi>I am with you all dayes, even to the consummation of the world:</hi> and John 14. <hi>The holy Ghost whom my Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This divine truth once established, to the end it might continue, was to be derived to posterity; not by angels sent to teach particular persons, nor by illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated brethren of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> still pretending new light, but by a continued succession of known visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pastours, and bishops lawfully ordained and sent to preach it perpetually, in despight of all new secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and novellers whatsoever. Whence, we say, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that not for six hundred years only, as many protestants grant, there was a true church free from spot of error, but likewise in all ages following there
<pb facs="tcp:51534:5"/>
ever was and must be such a church, in the union wherof all sorts might be saved.</p>
            <p>For to say (as some protestants doe) the church was long invisible (besides that it is contrary to many clear prophesies and predictions of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) it barreth the heathen of necessary means to salvation, whilst he seeketh not the true church, with which to jown hands; and amongst christians this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibilitie supposed, it were very hard to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with her in the administration of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We then affirm, and let our adversaries dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it if they can, that the Roman church hath bin always visible.</p>
            <p>We affirm that the Roman church hath bin always catholike, <hi>viz.</hi> universall.</p>
            <p>The Romish church hath ever had a succession of true bishops and pastors derived from the Apostles, still teaching the same unchanged doctrine, in all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall poynts of faith.</p>
            <p>All which going together, and being onely found in her, and no other church, do evidently prove that she alone is truly Apostolicall, and consequently out of her there neither is nor can be salvation.</p>
            <p>To disprove us herin, we require that a protestant church with these marks may be shewed to have bin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways extant.</p>
            <p>Or, if they cannot do this (as we well know they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not) let them labour to assign us another catholike church, distinct from the Roman, when she, as they falsly suppose, fell from the first truth?</p>
            <p>Or at least they must shew us who were the true professors of protestancy in the immediate age before <hi>Luther</hi> began, in what city, town, or countrey they dwelt, and what writers speak of them which lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51534:5"/>
If they cannot satisfie us in any of these demands, in which alone we offer to joyn issue with them, then do we think the day to be ours: if they can name any who did both believe and professe the protestant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in all points, let them do it, and then, if we do not disprove them, the day is theirs. And seeing all is brought to this issue, we wish your learned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter us in this only point, and whatsoever they shall return for answer not belonging hereunto, we shall account it impertinent, and unworthy reply, as not direct to our purpose, which is to find out the true catholike and visible church.</p>
            <p>Ridiculous it is to answer, as some do, that there were true believing protestants when <hi>Luther</hi> began, but durst not for fear of fire professe their faith: this wee say is to condemn them to have had no faith at all, but to be a dissembling company of such, as were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hot nor cold; Christ saying of such, <hi>he that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me before men, I will deny him before my father in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or if your men fly this difficulty, we will joyn issue with them in the maintenance of that faith and religion into which we Englishmen were first converted by <hi>Austine</hi> a monk, a man of God sent by <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> more then a thousand years since: a faith confirmed by miracle from heaven, and therefore must needs be true, and never noted to differ from the common received faith of christendome in those days, as appeareth by the severall epistles of the said S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> to the bishops of <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> with all whom he held communion of faith, so as if Christ had a catholike church upon earth, as needs he must, S. <hi>Gregory</hi> was of it; and it then being a true church, we say (holding still the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enets) it must needs be so now, Gods truthbeing, like unto himself,
<pb facs="tcp:51534:6"/>
without change: and therefore if an angell should come from heaven to teach us any other doctrine then we first received, we are not to hear him, the good seed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever first sowed, and the Galathians were worthily reprehended by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for not constantly retaining their first planted faith.</p>
            <p>Or lastly, if you desire to goe nearer to the times of the apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>les, we will joyn with you to prove our faith in the days of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, who first built and opened christian churches; and gave freedom for christians to come together, and to know and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish to the world what was held by them, which before could not so well be done by reason of the great persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in which the church had bin till then generally eclipsed.</p>

Now because our Romish adversaries conceive that they have most advantage in this dispute of all other, and therefore seek to reduce all questions to it (as you hear in the chalenge) I hold it fit, in this proamble to the ensuing encounter, exactly to state it and</hi> set it upon its true bases.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In this question touching the visibilitie of the Catholike Church three terms are to be explicated.</hi>

               <hi>First</hi> church: <hi>by church we understand not a particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or company confined to one certain place, parish, city, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for such a particular Church is not always visible. Where there have been visible professours in many famous cities, and countries, there are few or none now; and where there were none before, as in divers parts of</hi> America, <hi>there are visible churches now. The can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> catholike <hi>is taken in a double sense, logicall, and theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall: logicall, for a generic all notion of a church which is predicated of every particular church,</hi> tanquam genus de specie, <hi>as when we say the Greek or the Latine is a christian church. In this sense church is the object of the understanding, not of the sense; and catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like so taken is intelligible, not sensible or visible. For,</hi> universalia (qua talia) non cadunt sub sensum. <hi>Secondly theologicall, for the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
<pb facs="tcp:51534:7"/>
of all that are called to the knowledge of the truth, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of salvation by Christ, having Gods word and ordinances among them. The catholike church so taken is spread over the face of the whole earth, and though not in the whole lump, yet in every part and parcel thereof is visible, so long as that part and parcel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth a member or portion of the catholike church; and though some members, like branches of the golden tree in the poet, be cut off or wither, yet others rise up in their places, or upon some other boughs or arms of that great tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> visible, <hi>when we say the catholike church in a theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal notion is visible, we mean in respect of outward profession of faith, and publike use of sacraments common to all christians, not in respect of the inward grace of the spirit and proper marks of the elect; for so it is not object to sense. Those marks are like the white-stone in the Apocalypse,</hi> which no man knoweth but he that receiveth it, <hi>and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>in this notion the whole companie of the elect is by our divines called the</hi> invisible church: <hi>not that the elect in it are not seen, but because this cannot be seene or known by sense that they are elect. A child seeth a shining stone, which is a diamond, topaz, or some precious gem; but he knoweth it not to be a true jewell: all men knew</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel <hi>to be an Israelite, but our Saviour only, the beams of whose eyes pierced into the hidden corners of his heart, could say,</hi> behold, a true Israelite in whom there is no guil. <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 47.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That a man is a true Israelite, that is, hath true faith, is a matter of faith; and the catholike church taken for a companie of such as they are such, is an article of our creed:</hi> credo sanctam ecclesiam ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicam, I beleeve there is such a holy catholike church, <hi>but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I nor any man else can discover it to be such by sense. Yet to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd all mistaking, the church we beleeve in the creed is not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct church from that which we see in the severall and particular members thereof. For the elect which make the invisible church, are in the visible as the soul is in the bodie, or a diamond in a ring, or the apple in the eye, or gold in the oare: and we may properly call them</hi> the church of the church, <hi>as</hi> Demosthenes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>called</hi> Athens <hi>the</hi> Greece of Greece <hi>and</hi> Cicero Leontium <hi>the</hi> Sicilie of Sicilie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of the catholike church, as it is invisible, we dispute not now; but as it is in the parts and members thereof visible: and our question is rather</hi> de modo <hi>than</hi> de re, <hi>not whether the church be always visible, but how farre it is visible, and whether such visibilitie be a

All their</hi> sacrifices <hi>they could then</hi> offer <hi>were their</hi> broken and contrite hearts, <hi>and their</hi> sweetest incense <hi>their</hi> burning desires, <hi>and their</hi> drink offerings <hi>their</hi> tears, <hi>which they powred out by the waters of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and made them waters of Marah, salt and bitter. No marvail that the spouse of Christ hid her self in a strange land, and then covered her face, when it was swoln with grief and blubbered with tears; but did she ever so in her own country and kingdom. Did she ever wear a mask in</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Israel? <hi>Did she ever there shut up her self in her closet, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her plants? Certainly she did, as we read</hi> 2 Chro. 15. 3. Now for a long season Israel had been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without the law: but when they in their trouble did turn to the Lord God of Israel and sought him, he was found of them. <hi>v.</hi> 5. and in those times there was no peace to him that went out, not to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.</p>

                  <p>When I read your preface and compared it with that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, I could not but think of <hi>Oretes</hi> pots sent for a present to <note place="margin">Bruson. facet. et exem. l. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Polycrates,</hi> in which there was a little gold laid on the top, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it nothing but trash; for after these two golden assertions of the unity and immutability of the true, divine and infallible faith, laid as it were in the top of your discourse, there is nothing to be found under them but lead and trash, as shall appear hereafter in the <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it.</hi> I grant there is one, and but one true, divine and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faith; but you should have explicated, how but one, and in what sense. Divine and infallible faith hath been always, and is one for substance, though not for circumstance: all beleevers even from <hi>Adam</hi> were, though not in name, yet in truth <hi>christians,</hi> Christ and his meritorious actions and passions were the object of their faith as well as ours: but they beleeved in Christ <hi>to come,</hi> we in Christ that <hi>is come:</hi> we and they resemble the spies that carried the bunch of grapes on their shoulders, the former who went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looked backward, the latter who went behind looked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on the grapes: they looked forward with the eys of their faith on the incarnation, passion, resurrection and ascension of Christ to come, we look backward on these as past, they saw Christ in foregoing types, we in succeeding sacraments. Yea, but it may be objected, that many new articles of faith are daily declared, and many new theologicall conclusions found out, else how should knowledge encrease? How then is the faith of the church always one? For answer hereunto I will borrow <hi>Vincentius</hi> his decision, <hi>what</hi> (saith he) <hi>is there no profiting</hi> in Christs school? no growth <note place="margin">Vine cont hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. nullus ne ergo in ecclesia profectus? ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beatur sane &amp; maximus, sed ita tamen ut verè profectus ille fidei sit, non permuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio. <hi>Not beleeving it, or not in the true sense.</hi>
                     </note> in faith and the knowledge of salvation? Yes, <hi>very great,</hi> but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided always that this progresse be a going forward in the same way to heaven, not a turning out of the way: <hi>an improvement of faith, no change;</hi> that is, holding the same principles of faith, we may and ought daily by the studies of scriptures deduce new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, but such as are vertually contained in those principles, not such as are any way repugnant to them: so long as we mutilate not our creed by <hi>dis-beleeving</hi> or <hi>mis-beleeving</hi> any article of it, and whatsoever we offer farther to be beleeved, we cleerly and evidently conclude from scriptures, or other prime and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall articles of christian religion, the faith of the church is still one. Secondly, this faith is said to be divine in a three-fold regard: 1. Of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51534:12"/>
the object, which is God: 2. The efficient, which is the spirit of God: 3. The motive, which is the word of God, or the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the speaker, which is divine: and because God cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor be deceived, hence it followeth, that the faith which is grounded upon his word is infallible, and such is the faith of the reformed church of <hi>England, one, divine, and infallible;</hi> whereas on the contrary your romish faith is neither <hi>one,</hi> nor <hi>divine,</hi> nor <hi>infallible.</hi> Not one, for you differ one from another in many sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall points of faith, as is proved Paragraph the X. Nor divine, for the last resolution of your faith is unto the church, a company of men subject to error. Nor is it infallible, for it is partly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon unwritten traditions, which vary; partly upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Popes and councels, which contradict one the other; the generall synod held at <hi>Ariminum</hi> contradicted the first of <hi>Nice,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vid. infra.</note> in the point of Christs deity; the councell at <hi>Frankeford</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the second councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> in the point of images: the generall councell held at <hi>Lateran</hi> contradicted the generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at <hi>Basil,</hi> in the point of supremacie; and I could with a wet <note place="margin">See Bilsons su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, par. 3. &amp; Bellum papale.</note> finger produce divers decrees of Popes, out of the canon law, flat repugnant one to the other; but others have done it to my hand, and saved me this labour.</p>

                  <p>What protestants affirm that the catholike visible church, to wit, the company of those who professe the true christian faith, was a long time invisible? We deny that the church was ever driven to such straights, or reduced to such a paucitie or obscuritie (much lesse invisibility) but that new proselytes might have accesse unto her, and her own members communicate with her in the pledges of salvation, though not always without danger to their persons and estates. And therefore when you fight against an invisible church professing christianity, you fight also against an invisible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, and pursue your own fancie, as <hi>Antipho</hi> in <hi>Aristotle</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that he drave his own image in the ayr before him.

                  <p>We cannot prove our true church by the false marks you have set down: neither can you prove your false church by the true marks set down by us. Eminent visibilitie, &amp; illustrious ample unversalitie, and anti-christian combination under one head, the Pope, are no marks (as hath bin shewed) of the true church. And what then if we cannot prove our doctrin by them? Then you say, let them labour to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign us another catholike church distinct from the Roman, when she (as they falsly suppose) fell from her first truth. I have already shewed a church more ample than yours, and not only distinct from your Roman, but opposite to it as much as we in the most sundamentall poynt, to wit the papacy; yea so opposite, that the first sunday in Lent, when they solemnly curse all hereticks, as <hi>Arrius, Macedonius, Eutyches, Nestorius, Apollinaris, &amp;c.</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce in like manner an <hi>Anathema</hi> to the Pope. But what an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this? If you cannot prove your church by the fore-named false marks, then assign us some other church distinct from the Roman, in which these marks are conspicuous? To passe by this your lame inference, and make the best of such poor stuff as you bring; out of your own words a man may pick out such an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; either the Roman church continued still the church, or when she sell away, some other church must be assigned, which perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the truth, else there should be no Church in the world. If this be that you would say, the answer to this your objection is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easie on our parts; for we charge not the Latin church with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the true faith universally, but the chief governo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and leaders thereof, or (to speak more fully) that prevalent and predominant faction in the church of Rome, that hath born sway for some hundreds of years, which we say is plunged into many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and pestilent errors and superstitions: yet not into all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors at one leap, but they sunk into them by degrees; when then this faction in the Roman church, which we call the papacy, or the kingdom of anti-christ, or the <hi>Mystery of iniquitie,</hi> threw it self into an open gulf of error or heresie, we say, that that part of the Roman church, and elsewhere, which both secretly and openly impugned such error and heresie, and in as much as in them lay stopt such corruptions at the entrance, were the true church: as for example; when the fore-named faction by <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, &amp; <hi>Phocas</hi> his means, brought first into the church the Luciferian ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <note place="margin">Plat. in Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac. 3.</note> and anti-christian power of oecumenicall or universall bishop, and head of the whole church, they in the Greek and Latin church which opposed it, were the true church. When the same faction, by <hi>Irene</hi> and Pope <hi>Adrians</hi> means, decreed the worshiping of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the second councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> those who made head against them, and opposed this idolatrous decree in the councell of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenford,</hi> and synod of <hi>Paris,</hi> together with <hi>Ionas</hi> bishop of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and many in <hi>England</hi> who wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that blasphemous and idolatrizing synod, were then the true church. When by the strength of the same faction, transubstantiation first stole in secretly, and after was openly established by a decree in the councell of <hi>Laterane, Scotus Erigena,</hi> and <hi>Bertram, Elfricus,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Guliel. Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg. lib. 2. Histor.

Lastly, when the same faction prevailed so far in the councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> as to decree the mutilation of the holy sacrament, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving the laity of the cup, contrary to Christs institution, and the practise of the primitive church, <hi>Iohn Husse,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ierom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and the lords of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the known remainder of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> besides many millions of christians both in the Greek and Latin church, who oppugned and resisted openly or secretly that sacrilegious sanction, many of them to the effusion of their
