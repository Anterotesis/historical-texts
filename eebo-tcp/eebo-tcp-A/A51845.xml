            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface,</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Uch is the Divine Matter,
and admirable Order of the
Lord's Prayer, as became the
Eternal Wisdom of God, that
composed and dictated it to his
Disciples. In it are opened the Fountains of
all our regular Petitions; and the Arguments
contained to encourage our Hopes for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. In our Addresses to Men, our
study is to conciliate their favourable Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
but God is most graciously inclin'd and
ready to grant our Requests; therefore we
are directed to call upon him by the Title of
<hi>Our Father, in Heaven,</hi> to assure us of
his Love and Power, and thereby to excite
our reverent Attention, to raise our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
to confirm our Confidence in Prayer.
The supream end of our desires is the Glory
of God in Conjunction with our own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
<pb facs="tcp:47528:3"/>
This is exprest in the two first Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
That <hi>His Name may be Hallowed,</hi>
and <hi>His Kingdom come,</hi> that we may
partake of its Felicity. In order to this, our
Desires are directed for the Means that are
proper and effectual to accomplish it. And
those are of two kinds, the good things that
conduct us, and the removal of those Evils
that obstruct our Happiness. The good
things are either, the Spiritual and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Means to prepare us for Glory, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
cordial and constant Obedience to the
divine Commands, exprest in the third Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Thy Will be done on Earth, as
'tis in Heaven:</hi> Or natural and subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
the Supports and Comforts of this Life,
which are contained in the fourth Petition,
<hi>Give us this Day our daily Bread.</hi> The
removal of Evils is disposed according to the
order of the good Things we are to seek: We
pray that our Sins may be forgiven, the guilt
of which directly excludes from his glorious
Kingdom, that we may be preserved from
Temptations, that withdraw us from observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:47528:3"/>
the Divine Commands; and to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from all afflicting Evils, that hinder our
arrival at our blessed End. The Conclusion
is to strengthen our Faith, by ascribing to our
Heavenly Father, the Kingdom, Power,
and Glory, and to express our ardent desires
of his Blessing, by saying, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This divine comprehensive Prayer is the
Subject of the following Sermons, wherein
the Characters of Dr. <hi>Manton</hi>'s Spirit, are
so conspicuous, as sufficiently discover them
to be his; and the Reader is assured they
have been diligently compared with his own

INTRODUCTION
TO THE
EXPOSITION
OF THE
Lord's-Prayer.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>MATTH. 6. 6, 7, 8.</bibl>
                  <q>But thou when thou prayest, enter into thy
Closet, and when thou hast shut the Door,
pray to thy Father, &amp;c.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>I Intend to go over the Lord's Prayer; and to
make way for it, I shall speak a little of these
foregoing Verses, wherein our Lord treats
of the Duty of Prayer, and the Necessity of
being much therein.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this Chapter our Lord tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Hypocrisy of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> which was
plainly to be seen in all their Duties: their Alms,
their Prayers, and their Fasting</p>
               <p>I. For their <hi>Alms.</hi> Christ deals with that in the
four first Verses. It seems it was their Fashion
when they gave Alms to sound a Trumpet; and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47528:6"/>
their Pretence was to call all the Poor within hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Or to give notice that such a Rabby giveth
Alms to Day. Now our Lord sheweth, that tho
this were the fair pretence to call the Poor, yet
their Heart was meerly upon their own Glory,
their own Esteem with Men; and therefore he
perswades his Disciples to greater Secresy in this
Work; and to content themselves with God's
Approbation, which will be open, and manifest,
and honourable enough in due time, when the
Arch-Angel shall blow the Trumpet to call all the
World together, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 16. And Christ shall
publish their good Works in the hearing of Men
and Angels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 34, 35, 36. Thus he
deals with them upon the point of Alms.</p>
               <p>II. For their <hi>Prayers;</hi> Christ taxeth their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of Applause, because they sought out pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the greatest Resort, the Synagogues and
Corners of the Streets, and there did put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into a praying Posture, that they might be
seen of Men, and appear to be Persons of great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
and so might the better accomplish their
own Ends; their Publick Designs upon the Stage
(for the Pharisees were great Sticklers at that
time) and also their private Designs upon Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
Houses, that they might be trusted with the
management of Widows and Orphans Estates,
as being devout Men, and of great Sanctity and
Holiness.</p>
               <p>In which Practice, there was a double Failing:
<list>
                     <item>1. As to the Circumstance of <hi>Place,</hi> performing
a personal and solitary Prayer in a publick Place,
which was a great <hi>Indecorum,</hi> and argued the
Action to be Scenical, or brought upon the Stage
meerly for publick Applause. And certainly, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47528:6"/>
private Praying which is used by Men in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
doth justly come under our Lord's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</item>
                     <item>2. Their next Failing was as to their End:
[<hi>Verily they do it to be seen of Men.</hi>]</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But what Fault was there in this? Doth
not Christ himself direct us in his Sermon, <hi>Mat.
5. 16. Let your Light so shine before Men, that
they may see your good Works, and glorify your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in Heaven?</hi> And yet the Pharisees
are here taxed for praying, fasting, and giving
Alms, that they might be seen of Men; How can
these Places stand together?</p>
               <p>By way of Answer:</p>
               <p>1. We must distinguish of the different Scope
and Intention of Christ in these two places:
<hi>There,</hi> Christ's Scope is to commend and enjoin
good Works to be seen of Men, <hi>ad edificationem,</hi>
for their Edification; <hi>Here,</hi> his Scope is to forbid
us to do good Works to be seen of Men, <hi>ad osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem,</hi>
for our own Ostentation: <hi>There,</hi>
Christian Charity to the Souls of Men is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and <hi>here,</hi> Vain-Glory is forbidden.</p>
               <p>2. Again, <hi>Good Works</hi> are to be distinguished.
Some are so truly and indeed; others only in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
shew and appearance. Good Works; that are
truly so and indeed, Christ enjoins there; Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
and feigned Acts, that are only <hi>so</hi> in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
shew and semblance, are forbidden here.
To pray is a good Work, take inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Acts of it together, and so 'tis enjoined:
But hypocritical and superstitious Prayer, which
hath only the face and shew of Goodness; this
is forbidden.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47528:7"/>
3. We must distinguish of the <hi>Ends</hi> of good
Works; principal, and subordinate; adequate,
and inadaequate. First, the principal and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
End of good Works, must not be that we
may be seen of Men, but the Glory of <hi>God;</hi>
but now the subordinate, or less principal End
may be to be seen of Men. Again, it must not
be our adequate End, (that is) our whole and
main Intention and Scope; but a collateral and
Side-End it may be. It is one thing to do good
Works, only that they may be seen; it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to do good Works, that they may not
only be seen, but also be <hi>imitated,</hi> to win others
by them to give Glory to God. It is one thing
to do good Works for the Glory of God, another
thing to do them for the Glory of <hi>our selves:</hi>
We may do good Works to be seen, in the first
respect, but not in the last. We may not pray,
with the Pharisees, meerly to be seen of Men;
yet we may let our Light shine before Men, to
draw them to Duty, and give more Glory to
God.</p>
               <p>4. Again, <hi>There</hi> Christ speaks of the general
Bent of our Conversation, and <hi>here</hi> only of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and private Duties: It would argue too
much Hypocrisy to do these in publick, tho the
whole Frame and Course of our Carriage before
Men, must be religious in their sight. And that
is agreeable to what the Apostle saith, 2 <hi>Cor. 8.
21. We should provide for honest Things, not only
in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of Men.</hi>
And, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 15. Christians are advised there,
to be <hi>blameless and harmless, the Sons of God,
without rebuke, in the midst of a crook'd and perverse
Generation, shining among them as Lights in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47528:7"/>
World.</hi> That which is obvious to the Sight and
Observance of Men, must be such as will become
our holy Calling: But our private and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Duties, which are to pass between God and
us, these must be out of sight. I hope another Man
may approve himself to be honest and religious to
me, tho he doth not fall down, and make his
personal and private Prayers before me. But to
leave no scruple, if possible;</p>
               <p>5. We must distinguish of the diverse Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of that Phrase which is used here, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>[That we may be seen.]</hi> There is a twofold
Sence of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>That:</hi> It may be taken two
ways, as they speak, either causally, or eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
<hi>Causally,</hi> and then it implies and imports
the End and Scope why we do such a thing,
namely, for this very purpose, that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it. And thus the Pharisees here did pray,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that they might be seen of Men,</hi> (that is)
this was their main End and Scope. Thus <hi>That</hi>
is taken causally. Secondly, <hi>That,</hi> sometimes is
taken <hi>eventually,</hi> and then it doth not import the
End and Scope, but only the Event that will fall
out, and follow upon such a thing. Thus <hi>That</hi>
is often taken in Scripture. <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 39. Christ
saith there, <hi>For Iudgment I am come into the World,
that they which see not, might see; and that they
which see, might be made blind.</hi> 'Twas not Christ's
Scope to do so, but Christ foresaw that this
would be the Event of his coming into the World,
and therefore he saith, <hi>That, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Luke 14.
10.</hi> Christ tells them there, <hi>But when thou art bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to a Feast, go and sit down in the lowest Room,
that when he that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ade thee comes, he may say unto
thee, Friend, go up higher: Then shalt thou have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47528:8"/>
worship in the presence of them that sit at Meat with
thee. That</hi> is taken eventually, not causally: for
Christ doth not bid them there, to set themselves
at the lower End of the Table, for this very end,
or to make this their scope: that is the thing he
forbids, <hi>Affectation of Precedency:</hi> But <hi>that,
hoc est,</hi> then it will follow, (that is) this is likely to
be the Event; then the Master of the House will
come to you, if you do this. Not that it should
be your Scope to feign Humility, that you may
obtain the highest Place at the Table. And so
may Christ's Words be taken, <hi>Let your Light so
shine,</hi> &amp;c. This will fall out upon it then, Men
will be conscious to your Christian Carriage, and
gracious Behaviour, and by that means God will
be much honoured and glorified: There it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
eventually. But here it is taken causally,
<hi>The Pharisees did it that they might be seen of Men;</hi>
that is, this was their Scope, and principal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
And thus may you reconcile these two
Places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Well now, Christ having taxed them for these
two Faults: For their undue <hi>Place,</hi> the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
and Corners of the Streets, being unfit
for a private and personal Act of Worship; and
for their End, that they might be seen of Men:
He saith, <hi>They have their Reward:</hi> That is, the
whole Debt is paid, they can challenge nothing at
God's hands. God will be behind-hand with
none of his Creatures. As they have what they
look'd for, so they must expect no more; they must
be content with their Penny. The Phrase is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from Matters of Contract between Man
and Man, and is a Word proper to those which
give a Discharge for a Debt. As Creditors, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47528:8"/>
Money-Lenders, when they are paid home the
full Sum which is due to them, then they can
exact no more: So here, they must be contented
with the empty windy Puffs of Vain-Glory, and
to feed upon the unsavoury Breath of the People,
they can expect no more from God; for the
Bond is cancell'd, and they have received their
full Reward already. Briefly, here is the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
in the several Rewards that the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
and the Children of God have: The
Hypocrites, they are all for the present, and
have their Reward, and much good may it do
them; there is not a Jot behind, 'twill be in vain
to expect any more: But now for the Children
of God, your Father will reward you; they must
expect and wait for the future. And yet in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
we read oftentimes, that the Children of
God have their Reward in this Life; but then
the Word in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
they have but in part; not the Word which
is used here, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifies they have
what is due, 'tis fulfilled, paid them. So those
Expressions in Scripture are to be taken: <hi>Ye have
eternal Life; And he hath; And that ye may have.</hi>
'Tis often spoken in Scripture of the Children of
God, so that they seem to have their Reward too.
They have their Reward, but it is partially, not
totally: There is something, the best Things, yet
behind. A Child of God, he hath Promises,
First-Fruits, some Beginnings of Communion with
God here; but he looks for greater Things to
come.</p>
               <p>Well then, Christ (having disproved the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Pharisees) seeks to set his own Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
right in the management of their Prayers, as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47528:9"/>
well as in their Alms. Pharisaism is very natural
in the best. We are apt to be haunted with a
carnal Spirit in the best Duties, not only in <hi>Alms,</hi>
where we have to do with Men, but in Prayer,
where our Business lieth wholly with God, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in Publick Prayer; even there much of
Man will creep in. The Devil is like a Flie,
which if driven from one place, pitcheth upon
another; so drive him out of Alms, and he will
seek to taint your Prayers.</p>
               <p>Therefore Christ, to rectify his Disciples in
their personal and solitary Prayers, instructs them
to withdraw into some place of Recess and Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to be content with God, for Witness,
Approver, and Judg. <hi>But thou when thou prayest,
enter into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy
Doors, pray to thy Father which is in secret,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In which Words you may observe,
<list>
                     <item>I. A Supposition concerning solitary Prayer:
<hi>But thou when thou prayest.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>II. <hi>A Direction about it:</hi> Enter into thy Closet,
and shut thy Door, and pray to thy Father
which is in secret.</item>
                     <item>III. <hi>Encouragement to perform it:</hi> And thy
Father which seeth in secret, shall reward
thee openly. <hi>Where two Things are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted:</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. God's Sight; He is conscious to thy
Prayers, when others are not.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>God's Reward:</hi> He will reward thee
openly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:47528:9"/>
To open the Circumstances of the Text:</p>
               <p>I. In the Supposition, <hi>But thou when thou pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</hi>
Observe:</p>
               <p>1. Christ takes it for granted, that his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
will pray to God: He doth not say, <hi>If</hi> thou
prayest, but <hi>when</hi> thou prayest, as supposing them
to be sufficiently convinced of this Duty of being
often with God in private.</p>
               <p>2. I observe again, Christ speaks of <hi>solitary
Prayer,</hi> when a Man alone, and without Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
pours out his Heart to God: Therefore
Christ speaks in the singular Number, <hi>When thou
prayest;</hi> not plurally and collectively, When <hi>ye</hi>
pray, or meet together in Prayer. Therefore
he doth not forbid Publick Praying in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of the Saints, or Family-Worship; both are
elsewhere required in Scripture. God hath made
Promises to publick, and Church-Prayer, praying
with Men, or before Men: <hi>Mat. 18. 19. When two
or three are met together, and shall agree on Earth, as
touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done
for them, of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And
when they shall agree in one publick Prayer, it
seems to have a greater Efficacy put upon it:
When more are interessed in the same Prayer;
when with a combined Force, they do as it were
besiege the God of Heaven, and will not let him
go, unless he leaves a Blessing. Look as the Petition
of a Shire and County to Authority, is more than
a private Man's Supplication: So when we meet
as a Church to pray, and as a Family, there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
Strength. And in this Sence that Saying
of the School-men is Orthodox enough, <hi>viz. That
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47528:10"/>
Prayer made in the Church hath a more easy Audience
with God;</hi> why? because of the <hi>Concurrence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which are met there</hi> to worship God. Christ
doth not intend in this, any way to justle out
that, which he seeks to establish elsewhere. Let
your Intentions be secret, tho your Prayers be
publick and open in the Family, or Assemblies of
the Saints.</p>
               <p>II. Let us open the <hi>Direction</hi> our Lord gives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
solitary Prayer. The Direction is suited so
as to avoid the double Error of the Pharisees,
their Offence as to Place, and as to the Aim and
End.</p>
               <p>1. Their Offence as to the <hi>Place: Enter into thy
Closet, and shut thy Door.</hi> These Words are not
to be taken <hi>metaphorically,</hi> nor yet pressed too
<hi>literally.</hi> Not <hi>metaphorically,</hi> (as some would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
them) Descend into thy Heart, be serious
and devout with God in the Closet of thy Soul,
which is the most inward Recess and retiring
Place of Man. This were to be wanton with
Scripture. The <hi>literal</hi> Sence is not to be left
without necessity, nor yet pressed too literally, as
if Prayer should be confined to a Chamber and
Closet: Christ prayed in the Mountain, <hi>Mat.
14.</hi> 23. and, <hi>Gen. 24. 63. Isaac</hi> went into the
Field to meditate. The meaning is, Private
Prayer must be performed in a private Place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
from Company, and the Sight of Men, as
much as may be.</p>
               <p>2. Christ rectifieth them as to the <hi>End: Pray
to thy Father which is in secret:</hi> That is, Pray to
God, who is in that private Place, tho he cannot
be seen with bodily Eyes: Wherein Christ seems
secretly to tax the Hypocrisy of the Pharisees,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47528:10"/>
who did rather pray to Men, than to God, who
was invisible; because all their Aim was to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of Men, and to be cried up by them as
devout Persons. So that what the Lord saith
concerning Fasting, <hi>Zech. 7. 5, 6. When ye fasted
and mourned in the fifth and seventh Month, even
those seventy Years, did ye at all fast unto me, even
to me? And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink,
did not ye eat for your selves, and drink for your
selves?</hi> So here, was this unto God? No, tho
the Force and Sound of the Words carried it for
God, yet they were directed to Men. When
God is not made both the Object and Aim, it is
not to him: when you seek another Pay-Master,
you decline God, yea, you make him your
Footstool, a Step to some other Thing.</p>
               <p>III. Here are the Encouragements to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal,
private, and solitary Prayer; and they are
taken from God's Sight, and God's Reward.</p>
               <p>1. From God's Sight: <hi>Thy Father seeth in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret;</hi>
that is, observeth thy Carriage. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
and Frame of thy Spirit, the Fervor and
Uprightness of Heart, which thou manifestest in
Prayer, is all known to him. Mark, that which
is the Hypocrites Fear, and binds Condemnation
upon the Heart of a wicked Man, is here made
to be the Saints Support, and ground of Comfort,
that they pray to an All-seeing God. 1 <hi>Iohn 3.
20. If our Hearts condemn us, God is greater than
our Hearts, and knoweth all Things.</hi> Their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father seeth in secret, he can interpret their
Groans, and read the Language of their Sighs.
Tho they fail as to the outside of a Duty, and
there be much brokenness of Speech; yet God
seeth brokenness of Heart there, and it's that he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47528:11"/>
looks after. God seeth; what's that? He seeth
whether thou prayest or no, and how thou pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.
(1.) He seeth <hi>whether</hi> thou prayest or no;
mark that Passage, <hi>Acts 9. 11. The Lord said to</hi>
Ananias, <hi>Arise, and go into the Street which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Straight, and enquire in the House of</hi> Judas, <hi>for
one called</hi> Saul <hi>of</hi> Tarsus; <hi>for behold, he prayeth.</hi>
Go into such a City, such a Street, such a House,
such a Part, in such a Chamber, behold, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
The Lord knew all these Circumstances.
It is known unto him, whether we toil or loiter
away our Time, or whether we pray in secret;
He knows what House, in what Corner of the
House, what we are doing there. (2.) He seeth
<hi>how</hi> you pray. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 27. It is propounded as
the Comfort of the Saints, <hi>And he that searcheth
the Heart, knoweth what is the Mind of the Spirit.</hi>
God knoweth you throughly, and can distinguish
of your Prayers, whether they be customary and
formal, or serious Acts of Love to God, and
Communion with him.</p>
               <p>2. The other thing which is propounded here,
is <hi>God's Reward: And he will reward thee openly.</hi>
How doth God reward our Prayers? Not for any
Worth or Dignity which is in them. What Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
can there be in begging? what doth a Beggar
deserve in asking Alms? But it is out of his own
Grace and Mercy, having by Promise made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as it were a Debtor to a poor faithful and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Supplicant. But <hi>He will reward thee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly;</hi>
how is that? Either by a <hi>sensible Answer</hi>
to thy Prayers, as he doth often to his Children,
by granting what they pray for; as when <hi>Daniel</hi>
was praying in secret, God sent an Angel to him,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 20. Or by an <hi>evident Blessing</hi> upon their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47528:11"/>
Prayers in this World, for the conscionable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this Duty. <hi>Abraham, Isaac;</hi> and
<hi>Iacob,</hi> that were Men of much Communion with
God, were eminently and sensibly blessed; they
were rewarded openly, for their secret Converse
with him. Or it may be, by giving them <hi>Respect
externally</hi> in the Eyes of others. A praying Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
dart Conviction into the Consciences of Men.
It is notable, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his Distress sent for
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and not for the Magicians.
The Consciences of wicked Men are open at such
a time, and they know God's Children have spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Favour, and great Audience with him; and
he having the Hearts of all Men in his hands, can
manage and dispose Respect, according as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth:
And when they are in Distress, this Honour
God hath put upon you, they shall send for you
to pray with them; and those which honour
him, tho but in secret, God will openly put Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
upon them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. But chiefly this
is meant at the Day of <hi>Iudgment;</hi> then those
which pray in secret, their heavenly Father will
reward them openly. When thou relievest the
Poor, and shewest Comfort to the Needy, they
cannot recompence thee; but then thou shalt be
recompensed, at the Resurrection of the Just,
<hi>Luke</hi> 14. 14. There's the great and most publick
Reward of Christians. 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 5. Then he will
bring to Light the hidden Things of Darkness, and
will make manifest the Counsels of the Heart; and
then shall every Man have Praise with God:</hi> That
is, every Man that is praise-worthy, however he
be mistaken, and judged of the World; for the
Apostle speaks it to comfort them against the
Censures of Men. And mark, this is opposed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47528:12"/>
to the reward which the <hi>Pharisees</hi> pleased them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with: It was much with them to be well
thought of in such a Synagogue, or before such a
Company of Men; <hi>but your Father which seeth in
secret, will reward you openly,</hi> (that is) not only
in the Eyes of such a City, or Town, but before
all the World.</p>
               <p>The Point is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That private, solitary, and Closet-Prayer
is a Duty very necessary and profitable.</p>
               <p>It is a <hi>necessary</hi> Duty, for Christ supposeth it of
his Disciples, to whom he speaks: <hi>But thou,
when thou prayest,</hi> &amp;c. And it is <hi>profitable,</hi> for
unto it God makes Promises; you have a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which seeth in secret, and one day shall be
owned before all the World.</p>
               <p>First; It's a Duty <hi>Necessary;</hi> and that will
appear,</p>
               <p>1. From God's <hi>Precept:</hi> That Precept which
requireth Prayer, requireth secret and Closet-Prayer:
For God's Command to pray, first falls
upon single Persons, before it falls upon Families
and Churches, which are made up of single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
therefore where God hath bidden thee to
pray, you must take that Precept as belonging to
you in particular. I shall give some of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
<hi>Col. 4. 2. Continue in Prayer, and watch in
the same with Thanksgiving.</hi> And 1 <hi>Thes. 5. 17.
Pray without ceasing.</hi> These are principally meant
of our personal Addresses to God, every Man
for himself; for in joyning with others, the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47528:12"/>
Work is rather imposed upon us, than taken up
upon choice; and that can only be at stated
Times, when they can conveniently meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but we our selves are called upon to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to pray, and that without ceasing, (that is)
to be often with God, and to keep up not only a
praying Frame, but a constant Correspondence
with him. Surely every Man which acknowledgeth
a God, a Providence, and that depends upon him
for Blessings; much more every one that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
he hath a Father in Heaven, in whose
Hands are the Guidance of all the things of the
World, is bound to pray personally and alone;
by himself to converse with God.</p>
               <p>2. I shall argue it from the <hi>Example of Christ,</hi>
which bindeth us, and hath the force of a Law in
things moral; as Christ's Word is our Rule, so
his Practice is our Copy. This is true Religion,
to imitate him whom we worship. In this you
must do as Christ did. Now we often read that
Christ pray'd alone, he went aside to pray to
God; therefore if we be Christians, so it should
be with us. <hi>Mark 1. 35. And in the Morning
rising up a great while before Day, he went out and
departed into a solitary Place, and there prayed.</hi> He
left the Company of his Disciples, with whom he
often joyned, that he might be alone with God
betimes in the Morning. And again, you have
it, <hi>Mat. 14. 23. And when he had sent the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
away, he went up into a Mountain apart to pray;
and when the Evening was come, he was there alone.</hi>
And <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 12. It is said, <hi>He went out into a Mountain
to pray, and continued all Night in Prayer to God.</hi> You
see Christ takes all Occasions in retiring and going
apart to God. Now the Pattern of Christ
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47528:13"/>
is both engaging and encouraging.</p>
               <p>It is very <hi>engaging:</hi> Shall we think our selves
not to need that Help which Christ would sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto? There are many proud Persons which
think themselves above Prayer. Christ had no
need to pray as we have, he had the Fulness of
the God-head dwelling in him bodily, yet he was
not above Prayer. And if he had need of Prayer,
he had no need of <hi>Retirement,</hi> to go and pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
his Affections always served, and he was
not pestered with any Distraction; and all Places
and Companies were alike to him; and yet he
would depart into a solitary Place that he might
be private with God.</p>
               <p>Then the Pattern of Christ is very <hi>encouraging:</hi>
For whatever Christ did, he sanctified in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect;
his Steps in every Duty leave a Blessing.
Look as Christ sanctified <hi>Baptism</hi> by being baptized
himself, and made the Water of Baptism to be
saving and comfortable for us; and the <hi>Lord's-Supper,</hi>
by being a Guest himself, and eating
himself at his own Table; So he sanctified
<hi>private Prayer;</hi> when he prayed, a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
went out from him, he left a Strength
to enable us to pray. And it is encouraging in
this respect, because he hath <hi>experimented</hi> this
Duty; he knows how soon human Strength is
spent and put to it, for he himself hath been
wrestling with God in Prayer with all his Might.
His submitting to these Duties, gave him Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;
he knows the Heart of a praying Man when
wrestling with God with all Earnestness; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he helpeth us in these Agonies of Spirit. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
his praying is an Encouragement against our
<hi>Imperfections.</hi> Christians, when we are alone with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47528:13"/>
God, and our Hearts are heavy as a Log and
Stone, what a Comfort is it to think Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
prayed, and that earnestly, and was once
alone wrestling with God in human Nature:
<hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 23. and when the Enemy came to
attach him, he was alone striving with God in
Prayer; he takes all occasions for Intercourse
with God; and if you have the Spirit you will
do likewise.</p>
               <p>3. I might argue from God's end in <hi>pouring out
the Holy-Ghost;</hi> wherefore hath God poured out
his Spirit? <hi>Zech. 12. 11, 12, 13, 14. I will pour out the
Spirit of Grace, and of Supplication,</hi> &amp;c. He pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out the Spirit, that it may break out by this
Vent; the Spirit of Grace will presently run
into Supplication; the whole House of <hi>Israel</hi>
shall mourn, there's the Church, they have the
Benefit of the pouring out of the Spirit; and
every Houshold hath benefit, that he and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
may mourn apart, and every Person apart;
that we may go and mourn over our Case and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
before God, and pour out our Hearts in
a holy and affectionate manner. This Argument I
would have you to note, that this was God's
end in pouring out his Spirit, for a double rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
both to take off Excuses, and to quicken
Diligence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partly,</hi> to take off <hi>Excuses;</hi> because many say,
they have no Gifts, no Readiness and Savouriness
of Speech, and how can they go alone and pray
to God? Certainly Men which have Necessities,
and a sense of them, can speak of them in one
Fashion or other to God; but the Spirit is given
to help. Such is God's Condescention to the
Saints, that he hath not only provided an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47528:14"/>
to present our Petitions in Court, but a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to draw them up; not only appointed Christ
for help against our Guilt and unworthiness, but
likewise the Spirit to help us in Prayer; When we
are apt to excuse our selves by our Weakness
and Insuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ciency, he hath poured out the Holy-Ghost,
that we may pray apart. <hi>Partly</hi> to this end
the more to awaken our <hi>Diligence.</hi> That God's
precious Gift be not bestowed upon us in vain,
to lie idle and unimployed, he hath poured
out the Spirit, and therefore we should make use
of it, not only that we may attend to the Prayers
of others, and joyn with them; but that we may
make use of our own share of Gifts and Graces,
and open and unfold our own Case to God.</p>
               <p>4. That it is a necessary Duty, I plead it from
the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> who are a praying
People. O how often do we read in Scripture,
that they are alone with God, pouring out their
Souls in Complaints to him! nothing so natural
to them as Prayer; they are called a <hi>Generation of
them that seek God;</hi> Psal. 24. 6. As light Bodies
are moving upward, so the Saints are looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to God, and praying alone to him. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
was three times a day with God,</hi> and would
not omit his hours of Prayer, though his Life was
in danger; <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10. And <hi>David, seven times
a day do I praise thee;</hi> Psal. 119. 164. And <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
'tis said, <hi>that he prayed to God always;</hi> Acts
10. 2. not only with his <hi>Family,</hi> but <hi>alone,</hi> in
holy Soliloquies: He was so frequent and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
that he had gotten a Habit of Prayer (<hi>he
prayed always.</hi>) Well then, if this be the Temper
of God's People, then to be altogether, like them;
when we have no delight in these private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47528:14"/>
with God, or neglect them, it gives just
cause of Suspition.</p>
               <p>5. Our <hi>private Necessities</hi> shew that is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Duty, which cannot be so feelingly spoken
to and exprest by others, as by our selves; and
(it may be) are not so fit to be divulged and
communicated to others; we cannot so well lay
forth our Hearts with such largeness and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in our own Concernments before others:
There's <hi>the Plague of our own Hearts, which every
one must mourn over:</hi> 1 Kings 8. 38. As we say,
no Nurse like the Mother; so, none so fit, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
with a broken Heart to set forth our own
Wants before the Lord. There is some Thorn
in the Flesh that we have cause to pray against
again and again: <hi>For this I sought the Lord thrice,</hi>
saith St. <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8. We should put
Promises in suit, and lay open our own Case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Compassions of God. It is a <hi>Help</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to joyn with <hi>others;</hi> but at other times it
would be a <hi>Hinderance;</hi> we have peculiar Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of our own to commend to God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be alone.</p>
               <p>Secondly; This Closet and Solitary Prayer,
as it is a necessary Duty, so it is a <hi>profitable</hi>
one.</p>
               <p>1. It conduceth much to <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>largement</hi> of <hi>Heart.</hi>
The more earnest Men are, the more they desire
to be alone, free from Trouble and Distraction.
When a Man weeps, and is in a mournful Posture,
he seeks Secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, that he may indulge his Grief.
They were <hi>to mourn apart, Zech.</hi> 12. and <hi>Ier. 13.
17. My Soul shall weep sore for your Pride in secret
Places.</hi> So here, when a Man would deal most
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47528:15"/>
earnestly with God, he should seek Retirement, and
be alone. Christ in his Agonies went apart from
his Disciples. When he would pray more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
it is said, <hi>He was withdrawn from
them about a Stones cast;</hi> Luke 22. 41, 44.
it is said, <hi>He went apart.</hi> Strong Affections are
loth to be disturbed and diverted, therefore
seek Retirement. And it is notable, <hi>Iacob,</hi>
when he would wrestle with God, it is said, <hi>Gen.
32. 24. And</hi> Jacob <hi>was left alone, and there wrestled
a Man with him until the breaking of the Day.</hi>
When he had a mind to deal with God in good
earnest, he sent away all his Company.</p>
               <p>A Hypocrite, he finds a greater flash of Gifts
in his publick Duties, when he prays with others,
and is the Mouth of others; but is slight and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
when alone with God; if he feels any
thing, a little overly matter serves the turn: But
usually God's Children most affectionately pour
out their Hearts before him in private, where
they do more particularly express their own Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
there they find their Affections free to
wrestle with God. In publick we take in the
Necessities of others, but in private our own.</p>
               <p>2. As it makes way for Enlargement of Heart
on our part, so for secret <hi>Manifestations</hi> of <hi>Love</hi>
on God's part. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath a Saying, <hi>The
Churches Spouse is bashfull, and will not be familiar
and communicate his Loves before Company, but alone.</hi>
The sweetest Experiences which God's Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
many times, are when they are alone with
him. When <hi>Daniel</hi> was praying alone with
great Earnestness, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> was sent,
and caused to fly swiftly to him to tell him his
Prayers were answered, <hi>Dan. 9. 21. And</hi> Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47528:15"/>
                  <hi>while he was praying alone, an Angel of God
came unto him,</hi> to report the hearing of his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<hi>Acts</hi> 10. 3. and <hi>vers. 9. Peter,</hi> when he was
praying alone, then God instructs him in the
Mystery of the calling of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> then had
he that Vision, when he was got upon the top of
the House to pray. <hi>Before</hi> we are regenerated,
God appeareth to us many times when we do not
think of it; but <hi>after</hi> we are regenerated, usually
he appeareth upon more eminent Acts of Grace;
when we are exercising our selves, and more
particularly dealing with God, and putting forth
the Strength of our Souls to take hold of him in
private.</p>
               <p>3. There is this profit in it; It is a mighty
<hi>Solace</hi> and <hi>Support</hi> in <hi>Affliction,</hi> especially when
we are censured, scorned, and despised of Men,
and know not where to go to find a Friend with
whom we may unbosom our Sorrow; then to go
aside, and open the matter to God, it's a mighty
ease to the Soul: <hi>Iob 16. 20. My Friends scorn me;
but mine Eye poureth out Tears unto God.</hi> When
we have a great Burden upon us, to go aside and
open the matter to God, it gives Ease to the
Heart, and Vent to our Grief; as <hi>Hannah</hi> in
great Trouble, falls a praying to God, and then
was no more sad; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13. As the opening
of a Vein cooleth and refresheth in a Fever: So
when we make known our Case to God, it is a
mighty Solace in Affliction.</p>
               <p>4. It is a great Trial of our <hi>Sincerity,</hi> of our
<hi>Faith, Love,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> when we are alone,
and no body knows what we do, then to <hi>see him
that is invisible; Heb.</hi> 11. 27. When we are much
with God in private, where we have no Reasons
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47528:16"/>
but those of Duty and Conscience to move us.
Carnal Hypocrites will be much in outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
They have their Qualms, and pray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
weary, and do something for Fashion sake,
when foraign Reasons move them; but will
they so pray, as to <hi>delight themselves in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty?
Will they always call upon God?</hi> Job 27.
10. That Delight in God, which puts us upon
Converses with God, affects Privacy.</p>
               <p>5. It is a profitable Duty, because of the great
<hi>Promises</hi> which God hath made to it. This se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and private Prayer in the Text shall have a
publick Reward; it will not be lost, for God
will reward it openly. So <hi>Iob 22. 21. Acquaint
now thy self with him, and be at Peace; thereby
Good shall come unto thee.</hi> Frequent Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with, and constant Visits of God in Prayer,
what Peace, Comfort, Quickning brings it into
the Soul! So <hi>Psal. 69. 32. His Soul shall live that
seeks the Lord.</hi> Without often seeking to God,
the vitality of the Soul is lost; we may as well
expect a Crop and Harvest without sowing, as
any Liveliness of Grace, where there is not
seeking of God. Could a Man take notice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
in a Croud, whose Face he never saw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
So, will God own and bless you in the
Crouds of the Assemblies of his People, if you
mind not this Duty when you are alone?</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To reprove those which neglect Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set-Addresses

1. They wrong <hi>God:</hi> because this is a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part of the Creatures Homage; of that Duty
he expects from them, to be owned not only in
publick Assemblies, but in private.</p>
                  <p>And they wrong <hi>Themselves:</hi> because it brings
in a great deal of Comfort and Peace to the Soul;
and many sweet and gracious Experiences there
are, which they deprive themselves of, and a
Blessing upon all other things.</p>
                  <p>But more particularly to shew the Evil of this
Sin.</p>
                  <p>1. It is a Sin of <hi>Omission;</hi> and these Sins are
very dangerous, as well as Sins of <hi>Commission.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Conscience usually smites more for Sins of
Commission, than for Sins of Omission. To
<hi>wrong</hi> and <hi>beat</hi> a Father seems a more heinous and
unnatural Act, then not to give him due <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
and <hi>Attendance. We</hi> are sensible of Sins of
Commission; but yet <hi>God</hi> will charge Sins of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
as well as Commission upon you, and so
will <hi>Conscience</hi> too when it is serious; when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the plain Knowledg of God's Will you can
omit such a necessary part of God's Worship;
<hi>Iames 4. 17. To him that knoweth to do good, and
doth it not, to him it is Sin:</hi> That is, it will be Sin
with a Witness; Conscience will own it so, when
it is awakened by the Word, or by Providence,
or great Affliction, or cast upon your Death-bed;
how will your own Hearts reproach you then,
that have neglected God, and lost such precious
Hours as you should have redeemed for Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with him! Sins of Omission argue as great a
<hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>God's Authority,</hi> as Sins of Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for the same Law which forbids a <hi>Sin,</hi> doth
also require a <hi>Duty</hi> from us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:47528:17"/>
And Sins of Omission argue as much <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> as Sins of Commission. If two should
live in the same House, and never speak to one
another, it would be taken for an Argument of as
great Hatred as to sight one with another: So,
when God is in us, and round about us, and we
never take time to confer with him, it argues
much hatred and neglect of Him.</p>
                  <p>And Sins of Omission are an Argument of our
<hi>Vnregeneracy,</hi> as much as Sins of Commission. A
Man which lives in a course of Drunkenness,
Filthiness and Adultery, you would judg him to
be an unregenerate Man, and that he hath such a
Spot upon him as is not the Spot of God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
So, to live in a constant neglect of God, is
an Argument of Unregeneracy, as much as to live
in a course of Debauchery. The Apostle, when
he would describe the <hi>Ephesians</hi> by their uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
State, describes it thus; <hi>Eph. 2. 12. That
they lived without God in the World,</hi> when God
is not owned and called upon; and unless the
Restraints of Men, the Law of common Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Custom of Nations call for it, they live
without God. So <hi>Psal. 14. 1. They are corrupt,
they have done abominable Works; there is none that
doth Good, they are altogether become filthy;</hi> every
unregenerate Man is that Atheist. There is
some Dif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erence among unregenerate Men; some
are less in the Excesses and gross Out-breakings
of their Sins and Folly: some sin more, some
less; but they all are abominable on this account;
because they do not <hi>seek</hi> after God. And the
Apostle makes use of that Argument to convince
all Men to be in a State of Sin; <hi>Rom. 3. 11. There
is none that seeketh after God.</hi> The Heart may be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47528:17"/>
as much hardned by Omissions, (yea, sometimes
more) than by Commissions. As an Act of Sin
brings a Brawniness and Deadness upon the
Heart; so doth the Omission of a necessary Duty.
Not only the breaking of a String puts the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
out of Tune; but its being neglected, and
not looked after. Certainly by Experience we
find none so tender, so holy, so humble, and
heavenly, as they which are often with God:
This makes the Heart tender, which otherwise
would grow hard, dead, and stupid.</p>
                  <p>2. It is not only an Omission in general, but an
Omission of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is, first, a Duty very
natural to the Saints. Prayer is a Duty very
natural and kindly to the new Creature. As soon
as <hi>Paul</hi> was converted, the first News we hear of
him, <hi>Acts 9. 11. Behold, he prayeth.</hi> As soon as
we are new-born, there will be a crying out for
Relief in Prayer. It is the Character of the
Saints, <hi>This is the Generation of them that seek
thee.</hi> Psal. 24. 6. a People much in calling upon
God. And the Prophet describes them by the
Work of Prayer, <hi>Zeph. 3. 10. My Supplicants:</hi>
And, <hi>Zech. 12. 10. I will pour upon them the Spirit
of Grace and Supplication.</hi> Where ever there is a
Spirit of Grace, it presently runneth out into
Prayer. Look as a Preacher is so called from the
frequency of his Work; so a Christian is one that
calleth upon God: <hi>Every one that calleth on the
Name of the Lord, shall be saved.</hi> Rom. 10. 13.
In vain he is called a Preacher, that never prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth;
so, he is in vain called a Christian, that
never prayeth. As Things of an airy Nature
move upward; so the Saints are carried up to
God by a kind of Naturality, when they are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47528:18"/>
gracious. God hath no Tongue-ty'd or dumb
Children; they are all crying, <hi>Abba, Father.</hi>
Then, it is an Omission of a Duty which is of great
<hi>Importance,</hi> as to our Communion with God,
which lieth in two Things, <hi>Fruition,</hi> and <hi>Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity;</hi>
in the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of God, and in being
<hi>familiar</hi> and often with him: Fruition we have
by <hi>Faith,</hi> and Familiarity is carried on by <hi>Prayer.</hi>
There are two Duties which are never out of
season, Hearing, and Prayer, both which are a
holy Dialogue betwixt God and the Soul, until
we come to Vision, the Sight of him in Heaven.
Our Communion with God here is carried on by
these two Duties: We speak to God in Prayer,
God answereth us in the Word; God speaks to
us in the Word, and we return and eccho back
again to him in Prayer: Therefore the New
Creature delighteth much in these two Duties.
Look as we should be <hi>swift to hear,</hi> James 1. 19.
until we come to seeing, we should take all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
and be often in hearing: So in Prayer,
we speak to God, and therefore should be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Time for this Work. In the <hi>Word</hi> God
comes down to us, and in <hi>Prayer</hi> we get up to
God; therefore if you would be familiar and
often with God, you must be much in Prayer.
This is of great Importance. You know the
very Notion of Prayer, it is a <hi>visiting</hi> of God,
<hi>Isa. 26. 16. O Lord, in Trouble have they visited
thee; they poured out a Prayer, when thy Chastening
was upon them.</hi> Praying to God, and visiting of
God, are equivalent Expressions. Now it argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
very little Friendship to God, when we will
not so much as come at him. Can there be any
Familiarity, where there is so much Distance and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47528:18"/>
Strangeness, as never to give God a Visit?</p>
                  <p>3. It is the Omission of <hi>personal and secret Prayer,</hi>
which in some respects should be more priz'd than
other Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Partly,</hi> because here our Converse with God
is more express as to <hi>our own Case.</hi> When we
join with others, God may do it for their sakes;
but here, <hi>Psal. 116. 1. I love the Lord, because he
hath heard [my] Voice, and [my] Supplication.</hi>
When we deal with him alone, we put the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
in Suit, and may know more it is we that
have been heard: We put God more to the
Trial; we see what he will do for us, and upon
our asking and striving.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Partly,</hi> here we are more put to the Trial,
what Love we will express to our Father in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
when we have no outward Reasons, no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
from Respects of Men, to move us.
In publick Duties, (which are liable and open
to the Observance of others) Hypocrites may
put forth themselves with great vigor, quickness,
and warmth; whereas in private Addresses to
God, they are slight and careless. A Christian is
best tried and exercised in private, in those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Intercourses between God and his own Soul;
there he finds most Communion with God, and
most Enlargement of Heart. A Man cannot so
well judg of his Spirit, and discern the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of it in publick, because other Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
and Necessities, mingled with ours,
are taken in, and because he is more liable to the
Notice of others: But when he is with God
alone, he hath only Reasons of Conscience and
Duty to move him. When none but God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious,
and our own Hearts, then we shall see
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47528:19"/>
what we do for the Approbation of God, and
Acceptance with him.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>partly,</hi> in some respects this is to be more
prized, because Privacy and Retiredness is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and is a great Advantage, that Mens Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
may be setled and composed for the Duty.
Sinful Distractions will croud in upon us, when
in Company, and we are thinking of this and
that. How often do we mingle Sulphur with our
Incense? carnal Thoughts in our Worship?
How apt are we to do so in publick Duties? But
in private, we are wholly at leasure to deal with
God, in a Child-like Liberty. Now will you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this Duty, where you may be most free,
without distraction, to let out the Heart to
God?</p>
                  <p>And <hi>partly,</hi> because a Man will not be fit to
pray in publick, and in Company, which doth
not often pray in secret; he will lose his Savour
and Delight in this Exercise, and soon grow dry,
barren, sapless, and careless of God. Look as
in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> you read there, that the
Glory of the Lord removed from the Temple by
degrees; it first removed from the Holy Place,
then to the Altar of Burnt-Offerings, then to the
Threshold of the House, then to the City, then
to the Mount which was on the East Side of the
City; there the Glory of the Lord stood hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a while, as loth to be gone, to see if the
People would get it back again. This seems to
be some Emblem and Representation of God's
dealing with particular Men: First, God is cast
out of the Closet, private Intercourses between
God and them are neglected; and then he is cast
out of the Family, and within a little while out
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47528:19"/>
of the Congregation; publick Ordinances begin
to be slighted, and to be looked upon as useless
things; and then Men are given up to all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness
and Loosness, and lose all: So that
Religion as it were dieth by degrees, and a carnal
Christian loseth more and more of the Presence
of God. And therefore if we would be able to
pray in Company, we must often pray in secret.</p>
                  <p>4. Consider the Mischief which followeth Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of private Converse with God. Omissions
make way for Commissions. If a Gardiner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
his hand, the Ground is soon grown over
with Weeds. Restrain Prayer, and neglect God,
and noisom Lusts will abound. Our Hearts are
fill'd with Distempers, when once we cease to be
frequent with God in private. It is said of <hi>Iob,</hi>
chap. 15. 4. <hi>Thou restrainest Prayer before God.</hi>
That Passage is notable, <hi>Psal. 14. 4. They eat up
my People as they eat Bread, and call not upon the
Lord.</hi> Omit secret Prayer, and some great Sin
will follow; within a little while you will be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up to some evil Course or other: Either bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Lusts, Oppression, or Violence; to hate the
People of God, to join in a Confederacy with
them which cry up a Confederacy against God.
The less we converse with God in private, the
more is the Awe of God lessen'd. But now a Man
which is often with God, dareth not offend him
so freely as others do. As they which are often
with Princes, and great Persons, are better
cloathed, and more neat in their Apparel and
Carriage: So they which are often conversing
with God, grow more heavenly, holy, watchful,
than others are; and when we are not with God,
not only all this is lost, but a great many Evils to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47528:20"/>
be found. It is plainly seen by Mens Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
how little they converse with God.</p>
                  <p>But now to avoid the Stroke of this Reproof,
what will Men do? Either <hi>deny the Guilt,</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
themselves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First; Some will <hi>deny the Guilt:</hi> They do call
upon God, and use private Prayer, therefore
think themselves to be free from this Reproof.
Yea, but are you as often with God as you should
be?</p>
                  <p>There are three sorts of Persons:</p>
                  <p>1. Some there are that omit it totally, cannot
speak of redeeming any Time for this Work.
These are practical Atheists, <hi>without God in the
World,</hi> Eph. 2. 12. They are Heathens and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
under a Christian Name and Profession.
We should <hi>pray without ceasing,</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 17.
(that is) take all praying Occasions: Therefore
they which pray not at all, all the Week long
God hears not from them, surely come under
the force of this Reproof.</p>
                  <p>2. There are some which perform it <hi>seldom;</hi>
O how many Days and Weeks pass over their
Heads, and God never hears from them! The
Lord complains of it, <hi>Ier. 2. 32. They have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
me Days without number.</hi> It was Time out
of mind since they were last with God.</p>
                  <p>3. The most do not perform it so often as they
should. And therefore (that I may speak with
Evidence and Conviction) I shall answer the
Case; what Rules may be given, how often we
should be with God, and when we are said to
neglect God.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Every day</hi> something should be done in this
kind. <hi>Acts 10. 2. Corneliu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> pray'd to God always,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47528:20"/>
every day he had his Times of Familiarity with
God. <hi>Daniel,</hi> tho with the hazard of his Life,
would not omit <hi>praying three times a day.</hi> Dan. 6.
10. And <hi>David</hi> speaks of <hi>Morning, Evening,
and Noon,</hi> Psal. 55. 17. Tho we cannot bind all
Men absolutely to these Hours, beause of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Conditions, Employments, and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
yet thus much we may gather from hence,
That surely they which are most holy, will be
most frequent in this Work.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Love</hi> will direct you. They which love one
another, will not be strange one to another; a
Man cannot be long out of the Company of him
whom he loveth. Christ loved <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi>
and <hi>Martha, Iohn</hi> 11. 5. and therefore his great
Resort was to <hi>Bethany,</hi> to <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s House. Surely
they which love God, will have frequent recourse
to him. In the Times of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> God trusts
<hi>Love;</hi> we are not bound to such particular Rules,
as under the Law: Why? for Love is a liberal
Grace, and will put us upon frequent Visits, and
tell us when we should pray to God.</p>
                  <p>3 The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God will direct you. There
are certain Times when God hath Business with
you alone; when he doth (as it were) speak to
you, as to the Prophet in another Case, <hi>Ezek. 3.
22. Go forth into the Plain, in the Desart, and there
I will talk with thee:</hi> So, get you to your Closets,
I have some Business to speak with you. <hi>Thou
saidst, Seek ye my Face: my Heart answered, Thy
Face, Lord, will I seek,</hi> Psal. 27. 8. God invites
you to Privacy and Retirement; You are sent
into your Closet, to deal with God about the
Things you heard from the Pulpit. This is the
<hi>actual</hi> Profit we get by a Sermon, when we deal
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47528:21"/>
seriously with God about what we have heard.
When God sends for us (as it were) by his Spirit,
and invites us into his Presence by these Motions;
it is spiritual Clownishness to refuse to come to
him.</p>
                  <p>4. Your own <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>outward Necessities</hi> will
put you in mind of it. God hath not stated
what Hours we shall eat and drink; the Seasons
and Quantity of it are left to our Choice. God
hath left many Wants upon us, to bring us into
his presence: Sometimes we want <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and
Counsel in Darkness; <hi>Iam. 1. 5. If any lack Wisdom,
let him ask of God, which giveth to all Men liberally.</hi>
It is an Occasion to bring us to God; God is the
best Casuist to resolve our Doubts, and guide us in
our Way. Sometimes we lack <hi>Strength</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
Temptations; the Throne of Grace was set
up for a Time of Need, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. when any
Case is to be resolved, and Comfort to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
We want Comfort, Quickning, Counsel,
and all to bring us to God. So for outward Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
too. Certainly, if a Man doth but observe
the Temper of his own Heart, he cannot neglect
God, but will find some occasion or other to bring
him into his presence, some Errand to bring him
to the Throne of Grace. We are daily to beg
Pardon of Sin, and daily to beg Supplies. Now
certainly, when you do not observe these Things,
you neglect God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; Others, to avoid it, will excuse
themselves: Why, they would pray to God in
private, but either they want <hi>Time,</hi> or they want
a convenient <hi>Place,</hi> or want <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Abilities.</hi>
But the truth is, they want a <hi>Heart,</hi> and that's
the Cause of all; and indeed, when a Man hath
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47528:21"/>
no Heart to the Work, then something is out of
the way.</p>
                  <p>1 Some plead they want <hi>Time:</hi> Why, if you
have Time for other Things, you should have a
Time for God. Shall we have a Season for all
Things, and not for the most necessary Work?
Hast thou time to eat, drink, sleep, follow thy
Trading? (how dost thou live else?) and no
time to be saved, no time to be familiar with
God, which is the greatest Business of all? Get
it from your Sleep and Food, rather than be
without this necessary Duty. Jesus Christ, who
had no such Necessity as we have, yet it is said,
<hi>Mark 1. 35. He arose a great while before day, and
went out, and departed into a solitary Place, and there
prayed.</hi> Therefore must God only be encroached
upon? the lean Kine devour the fat? <hi>Sarah</hi>
thrust out instead of <hi>Hagar?</hi> and Religion be
crouded out of Doors? <hi>Faelix illa domus, ubi</hi>
Martha <hi>queritur de</hi> Maria: That's a happy House,
where <hi>Martha</hi> complains of <hi>Mary. Martha,</hi>
which was cumbred with much Service, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>Mary,</hi> that she was at the feet of Jesus
Christ, hearkning to his gracious Counsel; but
in most Houses <hi>Mary</hi> may complain of <hi>Martha;</hi>
Religion is neglected, and goes to the Walls.</p>
                  <p>2. Some want a <hi>Place.</hi> He that doth not want
a Heart, will find a Place. Christ went into a
Mountain to pray; and <hi>Peter,</hi> to the top of the
House.</p>
                  <p>3. Many say they want <hi>Parts,</hi> they cannot tell
how to pray. Wherefore hath God given his
Spirit? In one fashion or other, a Man can open
his Case to God; he can go and breath out his
Complaints, the Lord will hear Breathings. Go,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47528:22"/>
chatter out thy Requests to thy Father: tho you
can but chatter like a Crane, yet do it with ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and with a Spirit of Adoption. We have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Christ given us for an Advocate, but the Holy-Ghost
to help our Infirmities. He hath given us
the Spirit of his Son, whereby we may cry, <hi>Abba,
Father.</hi> Gal. 4. 6. A Child can acquaint a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his Wants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>VSE</hi> 2. To exhort God's Children to Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency
in this Duty, and to much Watchfulness
and Seriousness in the performance of it.
First; To <hi>Frequency.</hi> For Arguments again
to press you.</p>
                  <p>1. It argueth more Familiarity to pray to God
alone, than in Company. He that goeth to a
Prince alone, and upon all Occasions hath access
to him in private, when Company is gone,
hath nearer Friendship, and a greater Intimacy
with him, than those which are only admitted to
a Speech with him in the Company of others:
So the oftner you are with God alone, the more
familiar. He loves to treat with you apart; as
Friends are most free and open to one another,
when they are alone.</p>
                  <p>2. Then you will have a more sensible Answer
of your own Prayers; you will see what God hath
done upon your Requests. <hi>Dan. 9. 21, 22. Daniel</hi>
was <hi>praying</hi> for the Church, and an Angel comes
and tells him, <hi>It is for thy Prayers and Supplications
that I am come.</hi> Therefore surely a Man would
take some time to go and plead the Promises with
God. But further, by way of Means:</p>
                  <p>1. Consider the Omnipresence of God, which
is the Argument in the Text: <hi>He is in secret, and
seeth in secret.</hi> If Men were convinced of that,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47528:22"/>
they would make Conscience of secret Prayer.
Look as Jesus Christ says of himself, <hi>Iohn 16.
32. You leave me alone, and yet I am not alone, for
the Father is with me.</hi> So when you are alone,
you are not alone; there is a Father in secret;
tho no-Body to see and hear, yet God is there.
We are apt to think all is lost, which Men are
not conscious to, and done in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ght. <hi>Acts
10. 4. Thy Prayers, and thine Alms, are come up for
a Memorial before God.</hi> God keeps a Memorial of
your private Prayers; there is a Register kept in
Heaven, and never a Prayer lost.</p>
                  <p>2. Consider the Excellency of Communion with
God. <hi>Ier. 2. 32. Can a Maid forget her Ornaments,
and a Bride her Attire?</hi> Women are very curious
and careful of their Ornaments, and will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
their Dressing-Attire, especially a Bride upon
the Wedding-Day, she that is to be set forth in
most costly Array, she makes it her Business to
put on Jewels, to be seen in all her Glory. God
is as necessary to us, as Ornaments to a Bride.
We should be as mindful of Communion with
God, as a Bride of her dressing Ornaments. <hi>(Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
they have forgotten me days without number.)</hi> What
ever is forgotten, God must not be forgotten.</p>
                  <p>3. Make God a good Allowance; resolve to be
much in the practice of it. It is best to have set
Times for our Religious Worship. For Persons,
which are <hi>sui juris,</hi> at their own dispose, it is
lawful, and very convenient to dedicate a certain
part and portion of our Time to the Lord of
Time. Lazy idle Servants must be tasked, and
required to bring in their Tale of Brick: So it
is good to task the Heart; to make God a fair,
and reasonable, and convenient Allotment of some
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47528:23"/>
part of our Time. <hi>David</hi> had his fixed Hours:
<hi>Three times a day will I call upon thee.</hi> And <hi>Daniel</hi>
had his set Times; he pray'd <hi>three times a day.</hi>
Tho we cannot charge you to observe these Hours,
yet you should make a prudent Choice your selves,
and consecrate such a part of Time, as will suit
with your Occasions, your Course of Life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to your Abilities and Opportunities. It is
an Expression of Love to God, to give him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that is your own; and it will be of excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Profit to you, and make your Communion
with him more seasonable and orderly. This
will make you careful and watchful how you spend
your other Hours, that you may not be unfit
when Times of Prayer come. 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 7. Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
dwell with your Wives according to knowledg,
that your Prayers be not hindred.</hi> But do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Task too great for your Strength, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
your selves with such an unreasonable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
as will not suit with your Occasions.
Men create a Trouble to themselves, and bind
themselves with Chains of their own making,
when they propose more Duty than they can
well discharge.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Do it</hi> seriously, <hi>with</hi> Caution, <hi>and warily.
Here Christ gives direction;</hi> When thou prayest,
enter into thy Closet, and shut thy Door, and then
think of thy Father which is in secret. <hi>We need a
great deal of Caution: for,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. When you shut the Door upon all others,
you cannot shut the Devil out of your Closets; he
will croud in. When you have bolted the Door
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47528:23"/>
upon you, and shut other Company out, you do
not lock out Satan; he is always at hand, ready
to disturb us in holy Duties; where-ever the
Children of God are, he seeks to come at them.
When the Sons of God met together, Satan was
in the midst of them. <hi>Iob</hi> 1. He meets in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
he gets into the Closet. When
<hi>Ioshua</hi> the High-Priest was ministring before the
Lord, Satan stood at his right-hand, ready to
resist him. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                     <p>2. There needs Caution, because in private
Duties there may be many <hi>Failings</hi> and <hi>Evils,</hi>
which we are apt to be tainted with in our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Addresses to God.</p>
                     <p>(1.) There may be danger of Ostentation;
therefore Christ gives direction here, that it
should be managed with the greatest Secrecy,
both as for Place, Time, and Voice. Let none
but God be conscious to our drawing aside, that
we may be alone. Withdraw your selves out
of the sight and hearing of others, lest Pride and
Ostentation creep upon you. The Devil will seek
to blast this serious Acknowledgment to God, one
way or other.</p>
                     <p>(2.) There may be <hi>Customariness,</hi> for fashion
sake. It is said of Christ, <hi>That he went into the
Synagogue on the Sabbath-Day, as his Custom was.</hi>
We may use accustomed Duties; but we must
not do them customarily, and for fashion sake, no
more than Christ himself did; for tho this was
his Custom, yet he was not customary in these his
Synagogue-Attendances. We are very apt to do
so, because we have used it for these many Years.
Men go on in a Tract of Duty, and regard not
the Ends of Worship. <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 3. they come
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47528:24"/>
with a fond Scruple, and Case of Conscience, to
the Prophet: They had an old Custom among
them, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ast for the Destruction of the Temple;
now when the Temple was built again, <hi>Should I
weep in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ith Month, separating my self, as I have
done these so many Years?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(3.) Much <hi>Slightness</hi> and Perfunctoriness of
Heart you may be guilty of. Such is the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
of Men, that they think God will be put
off with any thing. And tho they would set off
themselves with Applause in the hearing of others,
yet how slight are they apt to be, when they deal
with God alone. Consider, you must sanctify
the Name of God in private, as well as in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
you must speak to God with Reverence
and Fear, and not in an overly fashion. Take
heed of this Slightness; it is a great Wrong to
the Majesty of God. When they offered a sickly
Offering, saith God, <hi>I am a great King, and my
Name is dreadful among the Heathen:</hi> You do
not consider my Majesty.</p>
                     <p>(4.) There may be this Evil; <hi>Resting</hi> in the
Work, in the Tale and Number of your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
<hi>Luke 18. 11. I fast twice in the Week.</hi> Man
is very apt to rest and dote upon his own Worth,
and to build all his Acceptance with God upon
it; to come to God, and challenge him for a
Debt, as the Pharisee did. It is very natural to
rest in those Duties, and make them an Excuse
for other things.</p>
                     <p>(5.) There may be Pride, even in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of our <hi>Gifts.</hi> There is a Delight in Duties,
which seems spiritual many times, when it is not.
As when a Man delighteth in the Exercise of his
own Gifts, rather than in Communion with God;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47528:24"/>
when there is a secret tickling of Heart, with a
conceit of our own Worth; as when in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of a Duty we come off roundly, and Parts
have their free Course and Career. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
and Pride, it may be not only in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
where we have advantage to discover our
selves with Applause; but in private, between
God and our Souls. When a Man is conceited
of his Gifts, they may end in the private Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of them, to the wrong of God. When In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
is quick and free, he may have such a
delight, as may make him rest in the Work, as
it is a Fruit of Parts, rather than as a Means of
Communion with God. Therefore there needs
a great deal of Caution, when we are alone with
our heavenly Father.</p>

<hi>They</hi> pray'd to be seen of Men, but the

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First; The Sin taxed is set forth by a double
Notion: Here is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
the first we translate, <hi>Vain Repetitions;</hi> and the
last, <hi>Much speaking.</hi> Both may well go together;
for when Men affect to say much, they will use
vain Repetitions, go over the same things again
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47528:25"/>
and again; which is as displeasing to God, as it
is irksom to prudent and wise Men.</p>
               <p>But let us see a little what these Words signify.
The first Word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate
<hi>vain Repetitions. Battus</hi> was a foolish Poet,
that made long Hymns, consisting of many Lines,
but such as were often repeated, both for Matter
and Words. And <hi>Ovid</hi> brings in a foolish Fellow,
that would be often repeating the same Words,
and doubling them over.</p>
               <q>Montibus, inquit, erant, &amp; erant sub montihus illis.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>And again,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Et me mihi perfide prodis?</l>
                     <l>Me mihi prodis? ait—</l>
                  </q>
And from thence this Word is taken, which is
here used by the Evangelist, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or idle
babling over the same thing. And the Scripture
representeth this vain going over of the same
things. <hi>Eccles. 10. 14. A Fool also is full of Words;
a Man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be
after him, who can tell?</hi> The most judicious Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
do conceive there's a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an Imitation
of the Fool's speaking. Groundless, fruitless Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions
are here reproved, or the tumbling out
of many insignificant Words, and the same over
and over again; this is vain Repetition. But the
other Word which Christ useth to tax the same
Abuse, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Much speaking;</hi> it signifieth
Affectation of Length in Prayer, or using many
Words, not out of fervency of Mind, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to prolong the Duty, as if the length of it
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47528:26"/>
made it more powerful or acceptable with God,
or a more comely piece of Worship. This is what
our Lord here reproves, vain Repetitions, and
much speaking.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Here are the Reasons produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; they are two.</p>
               <p>(1.) That it is a Heathenish Custom, and that
grounded upon a false Supposition. The Heathens
were detestable to the Jews, and therefore their
Customs should not be taken up, especially when
grounded upon an Error, or a Misprision of the
Nature of God. Now the Heathens think they
shall be heard for their much speaking, for their
meer praying, and composing Hymns to their
Gods, with thundring Names repeated over and
over again.</p>
               <p>It is inconsistent with the true Nature of
God, <hi>vers. 8. Be not therefore like unto them; for
your Father knoweth what Things you have need of,
before you ask him.</hi> Here we learn three Things.
(1.) Christianity and true Religion takes up God
under the Notion of a Father, that hath a care
of his Children. This will decide many Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about Prayer, and what Words we should
use to God in the Duty; go to God, as Children
to their Father. (2.) He is represented as an
<hi>Omniscient God,</hi> one that knows all Things, our
Wants and Necessities. (3.) As an <hi>Indulgent</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who hath a propense and ready mind to
help us, even before we ask.</p>
               <p>From the Words thus opened, that which we
may observe is this: <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:47528:26"/>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That certainly it is a Sin, needlesly to affect
length of Speech, or vain Repetitions in Prayer.</p>
               <p>Our Lord dissuadeth us from it here, and his
Authority should sway with us: He knew the
Nature of Prayer better than we do; for he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
it, and he was often in the practice and
observance of it. So we are directed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<hi>Eccles. 5. 2. Be not rash with thy Mouth,
and let not thine Heart be hasty to utter any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: for God is in Heaven, and thou upon
Earth; therefore let thy Words be few.</hi> Remember,
you have to do with a great God, and do not
babble things over impertinently in his Ears. It
is a Truth evident by the Light of Nature: <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
verbis rem divinam facito.</hi> Platinus. If you be
to worship God, a needless Prolixity doth not
become Addresses to him.</p>
               <p>But because this Text may be abused, I shall
endeavour to clear it a little further. There are
two Extremes; the slight and careless Spirit, and
Babling.</p>
               <p>(1.) There is the <hi>slight</hi> and <hi>careless</hi> Spirit, who
doth the Work of an Age in a Breath, and is all
for Starts, and sudden Pangs, which pass away
like a Flash of Lightning in a dark Room; whose
good Thoughts are gone, as soon as they rush
into the Heart. A poor, barren, and slight Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which is not under the Influence and Power of
that Celestial Love, which keeps the Soul in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with God, cannot endure to be any while
with God. Alas! we need Stroke upon Stroke
to fasten any thing upon the Heart. We are like
green Wood, that will not presently take Fire,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47528:27"/>
until it lie long there, and be throughly and well
warmed; so until we have gone far in the Duty,
we can hardly get any warmth of Heart. They
which are short in Prayer, had need of much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
preparation of Heart.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Babler</hi> is another Extreme, who thinks
the Commendation of a Duty is to be <hi>long</hi> in it;
and affects to say <hi>much,</hi> rather than <hi>well;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
serious and short Speech makes the best Prayer.
<hi>Prov. 10. 19. In the multitude of Words there wanteth
not Sin:</hi> Either to God, or Men, 'tis true; but
especially when affected: So they do but beat
the Air, rather than pray to God.</p>
               <p>These, then, are the two Extremes; <hi>Shortness,</hi>
out of Barrenness or Slightness; or <hi>Length,</hi> out of
Affectation: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d we must carefully avoid these.
Christ would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> justify that Shortness, which
comes from Slightness, and Barrenness of Heart;
nor, on the other side, indulge the Affectation of
Length in Prayer.</p>
               <p>Therefore let us a little see,
<list>
                     <item>I. What is the Sin.</item>
                     <item>II. Give you the Force of our Lord's Reasons
here urged, or how conclusive our Saviour's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
are against this Practice.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>What is the Sin? That's necessary to be
known; for all Repetitions are not vain, nor is
all Length in Prayer to be accounted Babling.</p>
               <p>First; For Repetitions:</p>
               <p>1. When they express <hi>Fervency</hi> and <hi>Zeal,</hi> they
may be used: And so we read, Christ prayed
over the same Prayer thrice; <hi>Mat: 26. 44. O my
Father, if it be possible, let this Cup pass from me.</hi>
And another Evangelist sheweth, that he did this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47528:27"/>
out of special Fervency of Spirit; <hi>Luk. 22. 44. Being
in an Agony, he prayed more earnestly.</hi> And so we
read of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 9. 17, 18, 19.
<hi>O our God, hear the Prayer of thy Servant; O my
God, incline thine Ear, and hear; O Lord, hear; O
Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not
for thine own sake, O my God.</hi> All this was out of
vehemency; he goes over again and again the
same Request. When we use many Words of
the same kind and signification, and it be out of
vehemency and fervency of Spirit, it is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
               <p>2. This Repetition is not to be disproved,
when there is a special <hi>Emphasis,</hi> and spiritual
Elegancy in it, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 136. you have it twenty
six times repeated, [<hi>For his Mercy endureth for
ever,</hi>] because there was a speci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eason in it,
his purpose there being to she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> Unwearied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the unexhausted Riches of God's free
Grace; that notwithstanding all the former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences
they had had, God is where he was at
first. We waste by giving, our Drop is soon
spent; but God is not wasted by bestowing, but
hath the same Mercy to do good to his Creatures,
as before. Tho he had done all those Wonders
for them, yet his Mercy was as ready to do good
to them still. All along God saved and blessed his
People; <hi>For his Mercy endureth for ever.</hi> But as
there are Repetitions which have their Use; so
there are useless Tautologies, and vain Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
And such they are, when they neither come
from the Heart, nor go to the Heart; when
they come not from the abundance of the Heart,
but rather the emptiness of the Heart, because we
know not how to inlarge our selves to God,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47528:28"/>
therefore fall upon idle and useless Repetitions
of the same Words and Requests. As a Man that
hath small Skill in Musick, doth only play over
the same Note; so when Men have not a full
spiritual Abundance, they waste themselves in
Prayer in these idle Repetitions. And then they
go not <hi>to the Heart,</hi> they do not conduce to warm
the Affections. A vain clamorous ingeminating
the same thing without Faith, and without Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
meerly to fill up the Tale of Words, or to
wear out a little time in a religious Exercise;
that's it which is here condemned under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of vain Repetitions.</p>
               <p>Secondly; For the other word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or
<hi>much speaking.</hi> Every long Prayer is not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
for our Lord Jesus himself <hi>centinued all Night
in Prayer, Luke</hi> 6. 12. And in extraordinary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of fasting, Length seems to be very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<hi>Esther 4. 16. They fasted and prayed together
for three days and nights, without eating any Bread.</hi>
And <hi>Solomon</hi> pray'd long at the Dedication of the
Temple.</p>
               <p>But that which is forbidden, is, when Men
speak Words without need, and without Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
a needless lengthening out of Prayer, and
that upon a Conceit that it is more acceptable to
God.</p>
               <p>1. In the General, Prayer should be <hi>short,</hi> as all
Examples of Scripture teach us; and the Lord's
Prayer you see how concise and short it is, for
presently upon this our Lord teacheth his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to pray. For Prayer is a <hi>spending</hi> rather
then a <hi>feeding</hi> Duty. Those which affect long
speaking, many times run into this, they make
it a feeding Duty, for they mingle Exhortations
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47528:28"/>
with Prayer, which is a great Abuse: A Man
can bear up under the hearing of the Word for
an Hour or two, better than half an Hour in
Prayer, with that necessary Vigor of Spirit which
God hath required. Therefore the general Rule
is, Let your Words be concise, but full of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Look as in vast and great Bodies, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are more diffused and scattered, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are more unactive than those which
are of a smaller Compass; so in a long Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
there may be more of Words, but less of
Life.</p>
               <p>2. The Affectation of Prolixity is naught; usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
it comes from some evil Ground; either from
<hi>Pride,</hi> and Ostentation of Gifts. Thus we read,
the Pharisees were taxed for making long Prayers,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 14. that under the colour of them, they
might devour Widow's Houses, (that is) be
credited and trusted with the Management of
their Estates: Or else it may come from <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
such as is in the Heathens, who had unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Thoughts of God, as if he were harsh and
severe, and delighted in much speaking, and
need to be quickened: Or it may come from
<hi>Folly,</hi> for Folly abounds in Words though it be
scanty in true Affection and hearty Respect to
God. A wise Man is content with Words enough
to express his Mind: Choice and measure of
Speech discovereth Wisdom.</p>
               <p>3. So much time should be spent in Prayer,
and so many Words are necessary, as may be
convenient and profitable both for our selves
and others. For our <hi>Selves,</hi> when we are alone,
so much as may express Faith, and may argue
great Plea in the Promises; and so much as may
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47528:29"/>
reach fervent Desire; while the Fervency conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
the Speech should continue: and so much
as may express our filial Dependance, that we
have a Sense that God is our Father, which are
the ends for which Prayer was appointed. And
so as it may suit with the Conveniency of <hi>others,</hi>
that they may be warmed, but not tired, and may
not be exposed to the Temptations of Weariness,
and Wandrings, and Distractions in their Mind,
when things are spun out unto an unreasonable
length; for then it's neither pleasing to God,
nor profitable to Men. Thus I have stated the
Offence our Lord forbids; what are those vain
Repetitions and idle Babblings, such as arise
from Weariness of Soul, and mis-conceit of God,
or some other base Grounds; not that plentiful
Expression, which comes from a large and free
Heart, pouring out it self before the Lord. And
if we be sway'd by his Authority, these things
should be regarded by us, and we should remedy
these Sins in Prayer.</p>
               <p>II. Let us come to examine our Lord's Reasons
which are produced against it, and see how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive
they are in the Case, and you will discern
the drift of Christ's Speech.</p>
               <p>Our Lord reasons;</p>
               <p>First; From the Practice of the Heathens,
[<hi>But when ye pray, use not vain Repetitions, as the
Heathens do.</hi>] In this Reason, several Propositions
are couched and contained, which deserve to be
weighed by us.</p>
               <p>1. This is implied, That the Heathens had a
sense of the <hi>necessity of Worship,</hi> as well as the Being
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47528:29"/>
of a God. Though natural Light be <hi>inferioris
Haemisphaerii,</hi> of the <hi>lower</hi> Hemisphere, and chiefly
reacheth to Duties of the second Table, of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
between <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> for that Light
which was left in the Heart of Man, since the Fall,
more directly respects our Carriage towards
Men, and there it is more clear and open; yet it
so far reaches to the Duties of the <hi>higher</hi> Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere,
as that there is some discerning too of
the Duties of the <hi>First Table;</hi> of Piety as well as
Honesty: as that there is a God; and if there be
a God, he is to be worshipped; for these two
Notions live and die together. The rude Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
were sensible of a Divine Power which was
to be call'd upon, and consulted with in case of
Extremity; and that the way of Commerce
was by Worship. <hi>Ionah</hi> 1. 5. when the Storm
arose, <hi>They called every Man upon his God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Though Heathens were sensible of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a God, and the necessity of Worship; yet
they were <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>dark</hi> in <hi>Worship;</hi> for Christ
saith, <hi>Be not as the Heathen, for they think they
shall be heard for their much speaking.</hi> Usually a
half-Light misleads Men. The Heathens, though
they had some Notions of an eternal Power, yet
when they came to perform their Worship;
<hi>Rom. 1. 21. They glorified him not as God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
vain, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
(that is) in their Practical Inferences:
They saw an infinite, eternal Power, which was
to be loved, trusted, worshipped; but when
they came to suit these Notions to practice, to
love, trust, and worship him, there they were
vain, frivolous, and had Mis-conceits of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:47528:30"/>
3. Their Errors in Worship were many. Here
our Lord takes notice but of one, that they
thought to be heard for their much speaking;
and there the original Mistake of the Heathens
(and that which compriseth all the rest) was
this, a Transformation, or changing of God into
the Likeness of Man, which is very natural and
incident to us; upon all occasions we are apt to
mis-conceive of God, and to judg him according
to our own Model and Scantling; <hi>Ps. 50. 21. Thou
thoughtest I was altogether such an one as thy self:</hi> so
did these. Because Man is wrought upon by much
speaking, and carried away with a Flood of
Words, therefore they thought so it would be
with God. This Transformation of the Divine
Nature into an Idol of our own shaping and
picturing, the turning of God into the form of a
corruptible Man, this hath been the Ground of
all the Miscarriage in the World.</p>
               <p>But more particularly: their Error in this
matter was charging Weakness and Harshness
upon God, or not worshipping him according to
his Spiritual Nature.</p>
               <p>1. Charging <hi>Weakness</hi> upon God, as if many
Words did help him to understand their meaning,
or to remember their Petitions the better. Hence
that Practice of <hi>Baal</hi>'s Priests, 1 <hi>Kings 18. 26.
They called on the Name of</hi> Baal <hi>from Morning till
Night; O</hi> Baal, <hi>hear us.</hi> They were repeating
and crying again and again, <hi>O Baal;</hi> as if their
Clamor would awaken their God; whence <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah's
Sarcasm, He sleepeth, and must be awaked:</hi> As
those that for two hours together cried out, <hi>Great
is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Ephesians, <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi>
Ephesians, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 34.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:47528:30"/>
2. Their ascribing <hi>Harshness</hi> to God, as if he
were hard to be entreated, and delighted in the
pain of his Creatures, and would be more affected
with them, because they wearied themselves with
the Irksomeness of a long Prayer. Penal Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
are very natural. Superstition is a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
it vexeth the Soul with unreasonable Duty,
affects outward length to the weariness of the
Flesh. The general conceit is, that Man thinks
God must be served with some self-denial, and
the Flesh must be displeased; but it shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
but in a little, and in an outward way,
as <hi>Baal</hi>'s Priests gasht themselves; as if God
were pleased with our burdensom and long Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises.</p>
               <p>3. There was this Error in it; They did not
conceive aright of the <hi>Spiritual Nature</hi> of God,
as if he were pleased with the meer Task,
a long Hymn, and an idle Repetition of Words,
without Sense and Affection: Whereas the Lord
doth not measure Prayers by Prolixity, but by
the Vehemency; not by the Labour of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Work, but by the inward Affection mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
therein: and Words are only accepted
with him, as they serve to quicken, continue, or
increase our Affection.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Our Saviour's next Reason is drawn
from <hi>Vers. 8. Be not ye like unto them, for your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knoweth what things ye have need of, before you
ask him.</hi> It is inconsistent with the true Notion
of God. Here are three Propositions; all which
are of force to draw us off from babling, or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of many Words in Prayer. As,</p>
               <p>1. That God is a <hi>Father,</hi> and that both by
Creation and Covenant. By <hi>Creation,</hi> to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47528:31"/>
kind, so he will be ready to sustain that which he
hath made; he that hath given Life, will give
Food; he that hath given a Body, will give Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Things expect Supply thence, from whence
they received their Being. But much more by
<hi>Covenant,</hi> so he is our Father in Christ, <hi>(Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
thou art our Father, though</hi> Abraham <hi>be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of us</hi>—Isa. 63. 16.) Well, but what's this
to the present Purpose, that God is a Father?
This is a Check to babling; therefore we should
go to him in an unaffected manner, with a Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Spirit and Dependance, with Words reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
serious, and plain. Children do not use
to make starch'd Speeches to their Fathers, when
they want Bread, but only express their natural
Cry, and go to them for such things as they stand
in need of; there they speak and are accepted;
and a Word from a Child moves the Father,
more than an Orator can move all his Hearers.
Even such a naked Address should we make to
God in a plain manner; for when we come to
pray, Christ would have us take up God in the
Notion of a Father, and to behave our selves in
a natural way to him; for affected Eloquence or
Loquacity in Prayer, is one of the main things
Christ here disproves. Prayer ought to be sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and plain: Therefore the great Business of
the Spirit of Adoption is to make us cry, <hi>Abba,
Father;</hi> Rom. 8. 15.</p>
               <p>2. He is such a Father as is not <hi>ignorant</hi> of our
Wants. The care of his Providence is over all
the Creatures he hath made; God hath an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
over them, to provide Necessaries for
them; much more over his People. His Eyes
run to and fro, to find them out in all the places
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47528:31"/>
of their Dispersion; and he doth exercise his
Power for their Relief. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 9. Now this
Thought should be rooted in our Hearts, when
we come to pray to God; I go to a Father, which
hath found me out in the Throng of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and knows what is good for me. This is a
great ground why we should not use Battology,
because God knows what my Needs are. Words
are not required for God's sake, but for ours;
not to inform God, but that we may perform
our Duty the better. Well then, so far as they
are useful, so far they should be used; to bound
our Thoughts, to warm our Affections, to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
our Faith. (1.) To <hi>bound our Thoughts;</hi> for
an Interruption in Speech is sooner discerned, than
an Interruption in Meditation. (2.) And to
<hi>warm our Affections.</hi> Words at first are Vent to
Affection, but afterwards they continue to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the Affection; as a Hearth is first warmed
by the Fire, and then it serves to keep in the Fire.
(3.) And they conduce to <hi>strengthen our Faith,</hi>
while we plead Promises in God's hearing. We
wrestle with God, that we may catch a heat our
selves. And therefore Words should be only
used, as they conduce to the strengthning our
Faith, or continuing our Affection to God:
Longer than they serve that End in Prayer, they
are Babling, and vain Repetitions, and much
speaking, which Christ here forbids. Consider,
there is not a Change in God, but a Change in
us, wrought by Prayer. 'Tis neither to give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
to God, that he may know our mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
nor to move him, and persuade him to be
willing, by our much speaking: but only to raise
up our own Faith and Hope towards God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:47528:32"/>
3. He is such a Father, as is not <hi>unwilling</hi> to
relieve us. Your heavenly Father is very ready
to give you such Things as you stand in need of,
as Christ expresseth it, <hi>Mat. 7. 11. If ye being
evil, know how to give good Things unto your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
how much more shall your heavenly Father give
good Things to them that ask him?</hi> And, <hi>Luke 11.
13.</hi> it is, <hi>How much more shall your heavenly Father
give his holy Spirit?</hi> When you come to beg for
Grace, consider what earthly Parents would do
for a Child: Their Affections are limited, they
are in part corrupt; and poor straitned Creatures
have not such Bowels of Compassion as God;
and yet when a Child comes to them with a genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
Cry, with a sense of his Want, and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his Father, he cannot harden his Bowels
against his Child. This also checks much speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for we do not pray to stir up Mercy in him,
as if he needed much Intreaty, and were severe,
and delighted to put the Creature to Penance:
No, he is ready before we ask; he knows our
Wants and Needs, and is ready to supply us
with those Things we stand in need of, only will
have this comely Order observed. Sometimes
he <hi>prevents</hi> our Prayers, before we ask: <hi>Before
they call, I will answer; and I am found of them that
sought me not.</hi> Before we can have a Heart to
come, the Lord prevents us with his Blessing.
And sometimes he gives us <hi>what we ask.</hi> This is
the Condescension of God, that when you call,
he will answer; and when you cry, he doth in
his Providence say, What will you have, poor
Creatures? And he <hi>gives more than we ask:</hi> As
<hi>Solomon</hi> asked Wisdom, and God gave him more
than he asked, Wisdom, Riches, and Honour.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47528:32"/>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But here's an Objection: These No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
seem not only to exclude long Prayer, and
much speaking, but all Prayer. If God know
our Wants, and is so ready to give, whether
we ask or no, what need we open them to him
in Prayer at all?</p>
               <p>I answer; It is God's prescribed Course, and
that should be enough to gracious Hearts, that
will be obedient to their Father. Whatever he
intends, tho he knows our Wants, and resolves
to answer them; yet it is a piece of religious
Manners, to ask what he is about to give. <hi>Ier.
29. 11. I know my Thoughts towards you, Thoughts
of Peace; yet will I be enquired of you for these
Things.</hi> God knows his own Thoughts, hath
stated his Decrees, and will not alter the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Course of his Providence for our sakes; yet
he will be sought unto. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to bless them, and therefore promiseth, I
will do thus and thus for you; yet, <hi>vers. 37. I
will yet for this be enquired of by the House of</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<hi>to do it for them:</hi> I will do it, but you
shall milk out the Blessing by Prayer. This Course
is also <hi>necessary,</hi> and that both for his Honour,
and our Profit and Comfort.</p>
               <p>(1.) It is necessary for his Honour, that God
may still be acknowledged; that the Creature
may be kept up in a constant dependance upon
God, and may go about nothing, but may ask his
Leave, Counsel, and Blessing. <hi>Prov. 3. 6. In all
thy Ways acknowledg him, and he shall direct thy
Paths.</hi> We ask God's <hi>Leave</hi> that we may do
such a thing, for he hath the Dominion over all
Events: And if we are doubtful, we ask his
<hi>Counsel,</hi> whether we may stay here or there, or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47528:33"/>
dispose of our selves and Families: And we ask
his <hi>Blessing</hi> upon our Resolution. Now that we
may know God doth all, that he governeth all
humane Affairs; that we may live upon his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
and take our daily Bread from his
hands; and that we may see we hold all these
Things from our great Landlord, therefore we
pray unto him. We are Robbers and Thieves, if
we use the Creature without his Leave. God is
the great Owner of the World, who gives us our
daily Bread, and all our Supplies; therefore he
will have it asked, that we may acknowledg our
dependance.</p>
               <p>(2.) It is most for <hi>our Profit.</hi> Partly, that our
<hi>Faith</hi> should be exercised in pleading God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
for there we put the Promise in Suit. Faith
is begotten in the Word, but it is exercised in
Prayer; therefore it is called the <hi>Prayer of Faith.</hi>
In the <hi>Word,</hi> we take Christ <hi>from</hi> God; in <hi>Prayer,</hi>
we present Christ <hi>to</hi> God. That Prayer which
is effectual, it is an Exercise of Faith. <hi>Rom. 10. 14.
How shall they call on him, in whom they have not
believed?</hi> And as it concerns our Faith, so also
our <hi>Love,</hi> which is both acted and increased in
Prayer. It is acted; for it is Delight in
God, which makes us so often converse
with him. Thus the Hypocrite, <hi>Iob 27. 10.
Will he always call upon the Lord? Will he delight
himself in the Almighty?</hi> They that love God,
cannot be long from him; they that delight in
God, will be often unbosoming themselves to
him. It doth also <hi>increase</hi> our Love; for by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
of Prayer, we have new Fuel to keep in
this holy Fire in our Bosoms. We pray, and
then he gives direct Answers, <hi>Psal. 116. 1. I love
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47528:33"/>
the Lord, because he hath heard my Voice, and my
Supplication.</hi> So our <hi>Hope</hi> is exercised, in waiting
for the Blessing pray'd for: <hi>Psal. 5. 3. O Lord,
in the Morning will I direct my Prayer unto thee,
and will look up.</hi> That looking up is the Work
of Hope; when we are looking and waiting to
see what comes in from pleading Promises. It is
much too for our <hi>Peace of Conscience;</hi> for it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
us of our Burthens: It is the Vent of the
Soul, like the opening of a Vein in a Fever.
When our Hearts swell with Cares, and we have
a Burthen upon us, and know not what to do,
we may ease our selves with God. <hi>Phil. 4. 6. Be
careful for nothing; but in every Thing, by Prayer
and Supplication, with Thanksgiving, let your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
be made known to God: And the Peace of God
shall keep your Hearts.</hi> O blessed Frame, that
can be troubled at nothing here in this World,
where there are so many Businesses, Encounters,
Temptations! What's the way to get this
Calmness of Heart? Be much in opening your
Hearts to God; let your Requests be made
known to God. Look as in an Earthquake, when
the Wind is imprisoned in the Bowels of the
Earth, the Earth heaves, and shakes, and quakes,
until there be a Vent, and the Wind be got out,
then all is quiet: So we have many Tossings and
Turmoilings in our Minds, till we open and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosom
our selves to God, and then all is quiet.
Also it prepareth us for the <hi>Improvement of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
when we have them out of the hands of God
by Prayer: <hi>For this Child I prayed,</hi> said <hi>Hannah,
and I will lend him unto the Lord.</hi> 1 Sam. 1. 27, 28.
Those Mercies we expresly pray'd for, we are
more throughly obliged to improve for God.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47528:34"/>
What is won with Prayer, is worn with Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>VSE</hi> 1. To caution us against many Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in Prayer, which may be disproved and taxed,
either formally, or by just Consequence. I shall
instance in five.</p>
                  <p>1. An idle and foolish Loquacity, when Men
take a liberty to prattle any thing in God's hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and do not consider the Weight and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of Prayer, and what a Sin it is to be <hi>hasty
to utter any thing before God.</hi> Eccles. 5. 2. It is a
great Irreverence, and Contempt of the Majesty
of God, when Men go hand over head about
this Work, and speak any thing that comes into
their mind. As Men take themselves to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
when others speak unseemly in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
Surely it is a lessening, and a despising of
God, when we pour out raw, tumultuous, undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
Thoughts, and never think of what we
are to speak, when we come to God. <hi>Psal. 45. 1.
My Heart is inditing a good Matter:</hi> The Word
signifieth, it <hi>boils or fryes a good Matter.</hi> It is an
Allusion to the <hi>Mincah,</hi> or Meat-Offering, which
was to be boil'd or fry'd in a Pan, before it was to
be presented to the Lord, that they might not
bring a Dough-bak'd Sacrifice and Offering to the
Lord. Such ignorant, dull, sensless Praying, it
is a blaspheming of God, and a lessening of the
Majesty of God.</p>
                  <p>2. A frothy Eloquence, and an affected Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
in Prayer, this directly comes under Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof:
As if the Prayer were more grateful to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47528:34"/>
God, and he were moved by Words and Strains
of Rhetorick, and did accept Men for their Parts,
rather than Graces. Fine Phrases, and quaint
Speeches, alas! they do not carry it with the
Lord: They are but an empty Babble in his
Ears; rather than an humble Exercise of Faith,
Hope, Love, and Child-like Affections, and holy
Desires after God. If we would speak with God,
we must speak with our Hearts to him, rather
than with our Words. This is a Sin of Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as the other was of Neglect. 'Tis not Words,
but the Spirit and Life, which God looks after.
Prayer, it is not a Work of Oratory, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Memory, Invention, and Parts; but a
filial Affection, that we may come to him, as to
a Father, with a Child-like Confidence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
too much Care of verbal Eloquence in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and tunable Expressions, is a Sin of the
same nature with Babling. Tho Men should have
the Wit to avoid impertinent Expressions, and
Repetitions; yet when Prayer smells so much of
the Man, rather than of the Spirit of God, alas!
'tis but like the unsavoury Belches of a rotten
Breath in the Nostrils of God. We should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Matter, to the Things we have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to God, to our Necessities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather than
to Words.</p>
                  <p>3. Heartless speaking, filling up the Time
with Words; when the Tongue out-runs the
Heart; when Men pour their Breath into the
Air, but their Hearts are dead and sleepy, or
their Hearts keep not time and pace with their
Expressions. We oftner pray with our Tongues,
than with our Minds; and from our Memories,
than our Consciences; and from our Consciences,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47528:35"/>
than our Affections; and from our Affections, as
presently stirred, than from our Hearts renewed,
bended and inclined towards God. Be the Prayer
long or short, the Heart must keep pace with our
Tongues. As the Poet said, <hi>Disticha longa facit,</hi>
his Disticks were tedious; so it is tedious and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
to God, unless we make Supplication in the
Spirit. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18. Remember, God will not be
mocked.</p>
                  <p>4. When Men rest in outward Vehemency,
and loud Speech. Saith <hi>Tertullian, Quibus Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis
opus est, si pro streno audiamus?</hi> What Lungs
and Sides must we have, if we be heard to speak
to Heaven, by the Noise and Sound? In some
there is a natural vehemency and fierceness of
Speech, which is rather stirr'd up by the heat and
agitation of the bodily Spirits, than any vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of Affection. There is a Contention of
Speech, which is very natural to some, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
much from that holy Fervor, the Life and
Power of Prayer, which is accompanied with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
and Child-like Dependance upon God.
It is not the loud Noise of Words, which is
best heard in Heaven; but the fervent affectionate
Cries of the Saints, are those of the Heart, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than of the Tongue. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 17. it is
said, <hi>Moses cried to the Lord:</hi> We do not read of
the Words he uttered; his Cry was with the
<hi>Heart.</hi> There is a crying with the Soul, and
with the Heart to God. <hi>Psal. 10. 17. Lord, thou hast
heard the Desire of the Humble.</hi> It is the <hi>Desires</hi> God
hears. <hi>Psal. 39. 9. Lord, all my Desire is before thee;
and my Groaning i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> not hid from thee.</hi> The Lord
needs not the Tongue, to be an Interpreter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the Hearts of his Children. He
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47528:35"/>
that hears without Ears, can interpret Prayers tho
not uttered by the Tongue. Our Desires are
Cries in the Ears of the Lord of Hosts: the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of the Affections may sometimes cause the
extention of the Voice; but Alas! without this
it is but a tinkling Cymbal.</p>
                  <p>5. Popish Repetition, and loose shreds of
Prayer often repeated, as they have in their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
over and over again, their <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> so
often repeated, their <hi>Lord have Mercy;</hi> and in
their Prayer made to Jesus, <hi>Sweet Iesus, Blessed
Iesus;</hi> and going over the <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> and this
to be tumbled over upon their Beads, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
Prayer by tale and by number: Surely these
are but vain Repetitions, and this is that much-speaking
which our Lord aims at. Thus I have
dispatched the abuses of Prayer.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, about our <hi>Words;</hi> there is a use of them
in Prayer, to excite, and convey, and give vent
to Affection: Hos. 14. 2. <hi>Take with you Words, and
turn to the Lord, and say, Take away all Iniquity, and
receive us graciously.</hi> Surely the Prophet doth not
only prescribe that they should take Affections,
but take with them <hi>Words:</hi> Words have an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Now these may be considered, either when we
are alone, or in Company.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:47528:36"/>
1. When we are alone: Here take the advice
of the Holy-Ghost, Eccl. 5. 2. <hi>God is in Heaven,
and thou art upon Earth, therefore let thy Words be
few.</hi> How few? Few in <hi>Weight, Conscience,
Reverence.</hi> Few in <hi>Weight,</hi> affecting rather to
speak Matter than Words; concisely and feelingly,
rather than with curiousness, to express what you
have to say to God. Few in <hi>Conscience.</hi> Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a Bastard-Religion, and is tyrannous, and
puts Men upon tedious Services, and sometimes
beyond their Strength; therefore pray neither too
short, nor too long: do it not meerly to lengthen
out the Prayer, or as counting it the better for
being long; the shortness and the length must be
measured by the fervency of our Hearts, our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
necessities, and as it tendeth to the inflaming
our Zeal; as it can get up the Heart, let it still
be subservient to that. Few with <hi>Reverence,</hi> and
managed with that Gravity, Awfulness, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousness,
as would become an Address to God.
As <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. 31. had been reasoning
with God before, therefore he saith, <hi>Let not God
be angry, if I speak to him this once,</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
the Suit. Thus alone.</p>
                  <p>2. In <hi>Company;</hi> there our Words must be apt
and orderly, moving as much as may be, not to
God, but to the Hearers; managed with such
Reverence and Seriousness, as may suit with the
Gravity of the Duty, and not encrease, but cure
the Dulness of those with whom we join. And
what if we did in publick Duties choose out
Words to reason with God, as <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>Chap. 9.
14. Choose out my Words, to reason with him.</hi> If
we did use Preparation, and think a little before
hand, that we may go about the Duty with seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47528:36"/>
Advice, and not with indigested Thoughts.
But this hath the smallest Interest in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Our <hi>Thoughts;</hi> That we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
aright of God in Prayer, which is one of
the greatest difficulties in the Duty.</p>
                  <p>1. Of his <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Of his <hi>Relation to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Of his <hi>Attributes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, Of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> of God. Every
one that would come to God, must fix this in his
Mind, That <hi>God is;</hi> and that <hi>God is a Spirit:</hi>
And accordingly he must be worshipped, as will
suit with these two Notions. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. He that
cometh to God, must believe that <hi>God is,</hi> and
then that <hi>God is a Spirit;</hi> for it is said, <hi>Ioh. 4. 24.
God is a Spirit, and they that worship him, must wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him in Spirit and Truth.</hi> O then, when ever
you come to pray to God, fix these two Thoughts,
let them be strong in your Heart, <hi>God is:</hi> I do
not speak to an Idol, but to the living God: And
<hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> and therefore not so much pleased
with plausibleness of Speech, or tuneable cadency
of Words, as with a right Temper of Heart.
Alas! when we come to pray, we little think
God is, or what God is: much of our Religion is
performed to an unknown God; and like the
<hi>Samaritans, We worship we know not what.</hi> It is not
Speculations about the Divine Nature, or high
strain'd Conceptions, which doth fit us for Prayer:
the discoursing of these things with some Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
or Terms removed from common Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
this is not that which I press you to;
but such a sight of God, as prompteth us to a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and serious worshipping of him. Then we
have right Notions of God in Prayer, when we
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47528:37"/>
are affected as <hi>Moses</hi> was, when God shew'd him
his Back-parts, and proclaimed his Name, <hi>Exod.
34. He made haste, bowed his Head and worshipped;</hi>
when our Worship suiteth with the Nature of
God, 'tis Spiritual and Holy, not Pompous and
Theatrical. Well then, these two things must be
deeply imprinted in our Minds, that <hi>God is,</hi> and
that <hi>He is a Spirit.</hi> And then is our Worship
right.</p>
                  <p>For Instance,</p>
                  <p>1. For the first Notion, <hi>God's Being.</hi> Then is
our Worship right, when it doth proclaim to all
that shall observe us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or we that observe our selves,
there is a great, an infinite, eternal Power, which
sits at the upper end of Causes, and governeth all
according to his own Pleasure. Alas! the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of many is flat Atheism, they say in their
Hearts, either there is no God, or believe there
is no God. Therefore, do you worship him as
becomes such a glorious Being? Is his <hi>Mercy</hi> seen
in your <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Confidence?</hi> His <hi>Majesty,</hi> in your
<hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Reverence?</hi> His <hi>Goodness,</hi> in your
Soul's <hi>rejoycing?</hi> His <hi>Greatness</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> in your
trembling before his Throne? The <hi>Worship</hi> must
be like the <hi>Worshipped,</hi> it must have his Stamp up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
                  <p>2. For the other Notion, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Soul</hi> must be the chief Agent in the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
not the <hi>Body,</hi> or any Member of the Body.
Spirits they converse with Spirits: The Body is
but employed by the Soul, and must not <hi>guide</hi>
and <hi>lead</hi> it, but be <hi>led by it.</hi> Therefore see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be the <hi>Spirit,</hi> otherwise that which is
most Essential to the Worip is wanting. To have
nothing employed but the Tongue, and the Heart
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47528:37"/>
about other Business, is not to carry your selves
as to a God, and a God that is a Spirit. Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
your selves; where's my Soul in this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?
And how is it affected towards God?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As there must be Thoughts to direct
us in his Being and Nature; so also, in his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as a <hi>Father:</hi> As one that is inclinable to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
pity and help you. We have the Spirit of
Adoption given us for this very end and purpose,
that we may cry, <hi>Abba, Father;</hi> and Gal. 4. 16.
<hi>Because you are Sons, therefore he hath sent forth the
Spirit of his Son into your Hearts, crying, Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
And Rom. 8. 15. <hi>We have received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Adoption, crying, Abba, Father;</hi> that we may
come to God in a Child-like manner, dealing
with him as with a Father, acquainting him with
our Wants, Necessities, Burdens, with a hope
of Relief and Supply.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Ay, saith a distressed Soul, if my Heart
be thus carried up to God, if I could discern such
a Spirit of Adoption, prompting me to go to God
as a Father, then it would be better with me.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer:</p>
                  <p>1. Many times there is a Child-like <hi>Inclination,</hi>
where there is not a Child-like <hi>Familiarity</hi> and
Boldness: What's that Child-like Inclination?
The Soul cannot keep away from God, and that's
an implicite owning him as a Father. Jer. 3. 19.
<hi>Thou shalt call me, My Father, and shalt not turn
away from me.</hi> It is a Child-like act to look to
him for all our Supplies, and to recommend our
Suit: As when a Child wants any thing, he goes
to his Father.</p>
                  <p>2. There's a Child-like <hi>Reverence</hi> many times,
when there is not a Child-like <hi>Confidence;</hi> the Soul
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47528:38"/>
hath an awe of God, when it cannot explicitely
own him as our God, and Father, yet it owns
him in the humbling way, Luk. 15. 18. <hi>I have
sinned against Heaven, and before thee, and am not
worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> Tho we cannot confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
approach to God, as our reconciled Father;
yet we come with Humility and Reverence: Lord,
I would fain be, but I deserve not to be called thy
Child.</p>
                  <p>3. There's a Child-like dependance upon God's
<hi>General Offer,</hi> tho we have not an Evidence of the
Sincerity of our <hi>particular Claim:</hi> God offereth to
be a Father in Christ to all penitent Believers.
Now, when a broken-hearted Creature comes to
God, and looks for Mercy, upon the account of
the Covenant, tho he cannot see his own Interest;
for then we come to God, tho not as <hi>our Father,</hi>
yet as <hi>the God and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ;</hi>
and that's a Relief in Prayer; as, Eph. 1. 3. <hi>Blessed
be the God and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And
vers. 17. <hi>The God of our Lord Iesus Christ, the
Father of Glory.</hi> And Eph. 3. 14. <hi>I bow my Knees
unto the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Mark,
when we come to him as the Father of Christ, we
believe what God offereth in the Covenant of
Grace; namely, that he will deal kindly with us,
as a Father with his Children; that he will be
good to those that come to him by Christ. The
Term <hi>[Father]</hi> is not only to be considered with
respect to the <hi>Disposition</hi> or <hi>Qualification</hi> of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
but the <hi>Dispensation</hi> they are under. 'Tis
the New Covenant. In the new Covenant, God
undertakes to be Fatherly, that is, to pitty our
Miseries, to pardon our Sins, to heal our Natures,
to save our Persons. Now all that come for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47528:38"/>
to take hold of this hope set before them, may
come to God as a Father, if they believe the
Gospel in general, tho they are not assured of
God's love to themselves.</p>
                  <p>4. There may be a Child-like <hi>Love to God,</hi> when
yet we have not a Sense and Assurance of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Love <hi>to us.</hi> God hath a Title to our choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
and dearest <hi>Love,</hi> before we can make out a
Title to his highest <hi>Benefits.</hi> We owe our Hearts
to him. Prov. 23. 26. <hi>My Son give me thy Heart.</hi>
If you give him your Hearts, you are Sons, tho
you know it not. God may be owned as a Father,
either by our Sense of his Fatherly Love, or by
our <hi>Choice</hi> and <hi>Esteem</hi> of him, <hi>Optando, si non affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mando.</hi>
Come as Fatherless without him, <hi>Hos.
14.</hi> 3. or (to speak it in other Words) the unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Groans of the Spirit, do discover the Spirit
of Adoption, as well as the unspeakable Joys of
the Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. There is an Option and
Choice, tho we be not assured of our special Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>5. God is glorified by an <hi>Affiance,</hi> and a resolute
<hi>Adherence,</hi> where there is no <hi>Assurance.</hi> When
you are resolved, let him deal with you as an
<hi>Enemy,</hi> you will stick to him as a <hi>Father.</hi> Job. 13.
15. <hi>Tho he slay me, yet will I trust in him.</hi> Faith can
take God as a Friend, and Father, and put a good
construction upon his Dealings, when he seems to
come against us as an Enemy. And we give Glory
to God, when we can adhere to him as our only
Happiness, and trust his Fatherly Kindness and
Goodness, tho he cover himself with Frowns,
and hide himself from our Prayers; and you own
him as the Father of Mercies, tho it may be you
have no Sense and Feeling of his Fatherly Love to
you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:47528:39"/>
6. There is a difference between the <hi>Gift</hi> it self,
and the <hi>Degree.</hi> We cannot say we have not the
Spirit of Adoption, because we have not so much
of the Spirit of Adoption as others have; I mean
as to the <hi>Effects:</hi> We may have the Spirit as a
<hi>Sanctifyer,</hi> tho not as a <hi>Comforter;</hi> tho he doth
not calm our Hearts, and rebuke our Fears, yet
if he doth sanctify us, and incline us to God. The
Spirit was only given to <hi>Christ</hi> without <hi>measure,</hi>
but to Christians in a different Measure and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion;
and usually, as you submit more to his
gracious Conduct, and overcome the Enemies of
your Peace, the Devil, the World, and the Flesh.
The impression is left upon some in a <hi>smaller,</hi> and
upon others in a <hi>larger</hi> Character. All are not of
one growth and size; some are more explicitely
Christians, others in a Riddle. Much Grace doth
more discover it self, than a little Grace under a
heap of Imperfection. Some are more mortified
and Heavenly-minded than others.</p>
                  <p>7. When all other Helps fail, Faith will make
use of our common Relation to God as a <hi>Creator,</hi>
as we may come to him as the workmanship of
his Hands. It is better to do so than keep off
from him. And we may come to him as the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
of his Hands, when we cannot come to
him as Children of his Family. The Church saith,
<hi>Isa. 64. 8. Now, O Lord, thou art our Father: we
are the Clay, and thou our Potter, and we all are the
work of thy Hand.</hi> They plead for Favour and
Mercy, by that common Relation, as he was their
Potter, and they his Clay. And <hi>David,</hi> Psal.
119. 73. <hi>Thy Hands have made me and fashioned me:
give me understanding, that I may learn thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi>
Surely it is some Comfort, to claim
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47528:39"/>
by the Covenant of <hi>Noah,</hi> which was made with
all <hi>Mankind;</hi> when we cannot claim Mercy by
the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was made with
the Family of the <hi>Faithful.</hi> The Scriptures war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
us to do so; <hi>Isa. 54. 9. For this is as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of</hi> Noah <hi>unto me.</hi> All this is spoken to shew,
that one way or other we should bring our Hearts
to depend upon him, as a Father, for Succour
and Relief.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; His Attributes. Three this Text
offereth: God's <hi>Omnisciency, He knows;</hi> His
fatherly <hi>Care, Your Father knows what you stand in
need of:</hi> And his <hi>Readiness</hi> to help, even before
we ask.</p>
                  <p>1. He is <hi>Omniscient:</hi> He knows our Persons;
for <hi>Christ calleth his own Sheep by Name.</hi> Joh. 10. 3.
He knoweth every one of us by Head and by Pole,
by Person and Name. Yea, and he knows our
State and Condition. <hi>Psal. 56. 8. Thou tellest my
Wandrings; put thou my Tears into thy Bottle; are
they not in thy Book?</hi> All our Wandrings, he tells
them; all our Tears, he hath a Bottle for them:
to shew God's particular Notice, they are Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical
Expressions. And he observes us in the
very Posture, when we come to pray, and where.
<hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11. Go to such a Street, in such a Place,
and <hi>enquire for one</hi> Saul <hi>of</hi> Tarsus; <hi>for, behold, he
prayeth.</hi> The Lord takes notice, in such a City,
in such a Street, in such a House, in such a Room,
and what you are doing when you are praying.
And he seeth, not only that you pray, but <hi>how</hi>
you pray. <hi>Rom. 8. 27. And he that searcheth the
Heart, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he maketh Intercession for the Saints, according
to the Will of God.</hi> He can discern between <hi>Lust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:47528:40"/>
and <hi>Groans, Words</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> and such Words
as are the Belches of the Flesh, and such as are
the Breathings of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>2. There's his fatherly <hi>Care;</hi> for it is said,
<hi>Your Father knows what Things you have need of.</hi>
He knows what pincheth and presseth you. 'Tis
said, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 7. Casting all your Care upon him,
for he careth for you.</hi> It is not said, that he <hi>may</hi>
take care of you, but he <hi>doth</hi> take care. God
is afore-hand with us; and our carking Care
doth but take the Work out of God's hand,
which he is doing already. Our Cares are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
fruitless, burthensom; but his are assidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
powerful, blessed. A small Matter may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassion
much Vexation to us; but to him all things
are easy. Upon these Considerations, <hi>We should
be careful for nothing, but make known our Requests
unto God.</hi> Phil 4. 6. Praying for what we want,
and giving thanks for what we have; <hi>For your
Father knoweth you have need of these Things.</hi> Mat.
6. 32. His fatherly Love will not suffer him to
neglect his Children, or any of their Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Therefore if you have a Temptation
upon you to Anxiety and Carefulness of Mind,
and know not how to get out of such a Strait,
and conquer such a Difficulty, remember you
have a Father to provide for you: This will
prevent tormenting Thoughtfulness, which is
good for nothing but to anticipate your Sorrow.</p>
                  <p>3. The next Thought is, his <hi>Readiness to help.</hi>
This should be deeply impressed upon your Minds,
and should habituate these Thoughts, how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
God is to help, and to run to the Cry. <hi>Psal.
32. 5. I said, I will confess my Transgressions unto
the Lord; and thou forgavest the Iniquity of my Sin.</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:47528:40"/>
Before his Purpose could be brought to pass. Isa.
65. 24. <hi>Before they call, I will answer, and whiles
they are yet speaking, I will hear.</hi> So Jer. 31. 20. <hi>I
heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himself, &amp;c.</hi> God's Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
were troubled presently. He is more ready to
give than you to ask: This will help and direct
you mightily in the business of Prayer, for God
hath a care for his Children, and very ready to help
the weak, and relieve them in all their Straits.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For Directions about our <hi>Affections</hi>
in Prayer: three things are required, <hi>viz.</hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency,
Reverence, Confidence.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Fervency;</hi> that usually comes from two
grounds; a broken-hearted Sense of our Wants,
and a desire of the Blessing we stand in need of.
For the broken-hearted Sense of our Wants, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
Spiritual Weaknesses, are incident to the
best. All Christians have continual need to cry
to God. We have continual Necessities both
within and without. Go cry to God your Father
without Affectation, but not without Affection,
and seek your Supplies from him. Let me tell
you, the more Grace is increased, the more sense
of Wants is increased. For Sin is more hated,
Defects are less born. And then, there must be
a desire of the Blessings, especially Spiritual; our
Needs must stir up fresh Longings and holy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
after God. Mat. 7. 7. <hi>Ask, Seek, Knock.</hi>
Luk. 11. 8. <hi>For his Importunity, he will rise and
give.</hi> We spend the earnestness of our Spirits in
other Matters, in Disputes, Contests, Earthly Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits;
our importunate earnestness runs in a
worldly Channel: No, no, it must be from sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and sincerity, pouring out your Hearts
before him: No Sacrifice without him. Jam. 5. 16.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47528:41"/>
The effectual fervent Prayer of a righteous Man avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
much.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Reverence;</hi> a reverent respectful Carriage
towards our heavenly Father: Psal. 2. 11. <hi>Serve
the Lord with Fear, and rejoice with Trembling.</hi>
Mark, there is in God a mixture of <hi>Majesty</hi> and
<hi>Mercy;</hi> so in us there must be of <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
God's Love doth not <hi>abase</hi> his Majesty;
nor his Majesty <hi>diminish</hi> his Love. We ought to
know our distance from God, and to think of his
Superiority over us; therefore we must be seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Remember, <hi>God is greatly to be feared in the
Assembly of the Saints: and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e had in reverence of
all them that are about him,</hi> Psal. 89. 7.</p>
                  <p>3. With <hi>Confidence;</hi> Eph. 3. 12. <hi>In whom we
have boldness and access, with confidence by the Faith
of him.</hi> There is boldness in pouring out our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
to God, who will certainly hear us, and
grant what is good; we must rely upon his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Power in all our Necessities. He is so
Gracious in Christ, that he will do that which is
best for his Glory, and our Good; and upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Terms we should not seek it. If you would
not turn Prayer into Babling, much-speaking to
Affectation of Words; take heed of these Abuses,
and labour to bring your Hearts to God in this
manner.</p>

            <head>AN
EXPOSITION
OF THE
Lord's-Prayer.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Our Father, which art in Heaven.</head>
               <p>I Have insisted upon the foregoing Verses,
which do concern the Duty of Prayer; let
me now come to the Lord's-Prayer it self.
This Prayer was form'd and digested by
Christ, and therefore to be highly esteemed by
Christians. Jesus Christ, who was the Wisdom
of God, he knew both our Necessities, and the
Father's good Will towards us; and therefore
surely he would give us a perfect Form and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory.
We are not absolutely tied to this
Form; we do not read that it was ever used by
the Apostles, tho we have many of their Prayers
upon Record, in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and in the <hi>Epistles,</hi> yet
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47528:42"/>
they plainly differ as to the Construction of the
Words. And this very Prayer is diversly set
down by the Evangelists themselves. <hi>Mat. 6. 11.
Give us this day our daily Bread;</hi> it is in other
Words, <hi>Luke 11. 3. Give us day by day our daily
Bread.</hi> And, v. 12. <hi>And forgive us our Debts, as
we forgive our Debtors;</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 4. it is, <hi>And
forgive us our Sins, for we also forgive every one that
is indebted to us.</hi> But however, tho we are not
tied to this Form, yet I think it may be humbly
used: for Christ taught his Disciples how to
pray, while as yet they were in their Ignorance
and Tenderness, and had not received the Spirit.
And God usually puts Words into Sinners
Mouths; <hi>Hosea 11. 2. Take with you Words, and
say unto him, Receive us graciously.</hi> Look as <hi>Ioseph</hi>
is said to feed his Father, and his Brethren, <hi>as a
little Child is nourished,</hi> as it is in the Margent,
(there is not only Food provided, but it is put
into their Mouths) <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 12. So did Christ
teach his Disciples to pray, not only as directing
them what they should pray for, but putting a
Form of Words into their Mouths.</p>
               <p>In this Prayer, there are three Parts obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable:
<list>
                     <item>1. The Preface.</item>
                     <item>2. The Petitions themselves.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In the Preface we have a Description of God,
as always we should begin Prayer with awful
Thoughts of God. God is described, partly,
from his Goodness and Mercy, <hi>Our Father;</hi> and
partly, from his Greatness and Majesty, <hi>Which

I. His Goodness and Mercy, <hi>Our Father:</hi>
Where is set forth,
<list>
                     <item>1. The Relation wherein God standeth to his

                     <item>2. Their Propriety and Interest in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;

general Interest of all the Elect in Christ, <hi>Our

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I shall wave all which may be said concerning
Prayer in general; concerning the Lawfulness or
Unlawfulness of a Form in Prayer; The Disputes
concerning the Use of this Form; as also all the
Disputes concerning the Object of Prayer, which
we learn from hence to be God alone. Surely
Prayer is a Sacrifice, and belongeth only to God;
it cannot be made to any other but to him, who
knoweth all the Prayers that are made in the
World at the same time, and the Hearts of all
those that pray. I will also wave what might
be spoken concerning Preparation before Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for here there is a Preface before the Prayer
it self. Neither shall I speak concerning the
Necessity of conceiving right Thoughts of God
in Prayer; how we may conceive of his <hi>Goodness,</hi>
to beget a <hi>Confidence;</hi> of his Majesty, to beget
an <hi>Awe</hi> and <hi>Reverence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which I shall insist upon, is, the Notion
and Relation under which God is here expressed,
which is that of <hi>Father; Our Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe,</hi> Those that would pray aright, must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
themselves to God, as a Father, in Iesus
Christ.</p>

                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:47528:43"/>
Hypocrites at the last Day will cry, <hi>Lord,
Lord;</hi> but Christ hath taught us to say, <hi>Our
Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I shall,
<list>
                     <item>I. Enquire in what Sence God is a Father.</item>
                     <item>II. What Encouragements we have from
thence in Prayer, when we can take him
up under this Notion and Appellation.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I. In what Sence God is a Father? This Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
may be given to God, either essentially, or
with respect to personal Relation.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Essentially;</hi> and so 'tis common to all the
Persons in the Godhead, Father, Son, and Holy-Ghost;
all three are God, and our Father. And
thus not only the <hi>First</hi> Person, but the <hi>Second</hi> is
called the <hi>Everlasting Father,</hi> Isa. 9. 6. And the
Holy-Ghost, being Author of our Being, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
our Maker. But,</p>
               <p>2. It may be ascribed to God <hi>personally:</hi> And
so the first Person is called God the Father; and
that either with relation to Christ, or to us.</p>
               <p>(1.) With relation to Christ, as the Son of
God: So the first Person is called the <hi>Father,</hi> as
he is the Fountain of the Deity, communicating
to and with him the Divine Essence. <hi>Psal. 2. 7.
Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> The
personal Property of the Father, is to beget;
and of the Son, to be begotten. There is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<hi>Now,</hi> wherein God is said to beget him.
Thus he may be called the Father of Christ, as
he is the second Person; now, as Incarnate and
Mediator. Tho God be Christ's Father, as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47528:43"/>
Person; yet they are all equal in Power,
Dignity, and Glory: But as Mediator, God is
his Father in another respect. So it is said,
<hi>Iohn 14. 28. My Father is greater than I:</hi> Not
as <hi>God,</hi> for so he was equal: <hi>He thought it no
Robbery to be equal with God.</hi> Phil. 2. 6. But
<hi>greater than I,</hi> that is, consider him as <hi>Man</hi> and
<hi>Mediator,</hi> in the state of his Humiliation: For it
is notable to consider upon what occasion Christ
speaks these Words: <hi>If ye loved me, ye would
rejoyce, because I said, I go unto the Father; for
my Father is greater than I:</hi> That is, You ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
me, and prize my Company exceedingly,
because you see the Power which I put forth in the
Miracles which I do; ye would rejoice, if you
understood it aright; He is infinitely more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
than I appear in this State of Abasement
and Humiliation. Thus with respect to Christ,
God, the first Person, may be called the Father.</p>
               <p>(2) With respect to <hi>Vs;</hi> for the first Person
is not only the Father of <hi>Christ,</hi> but <hi>our Father;</hi>
John 20. 17. <hi>I go to my Father, and your Father.</hi>
We share with Christ in all his Relations: As
God was <hi>his</hi> God by Covenant; so he is <hi>our</hi> God.
And in this Sence, <hi>personally,</hi> it may be taken
here; for our Business lieth mainly with the
first Person, with whom Christ intercedeth for
us: 1 <hi>Iohn 2. 1. We have an Advocate with the
Father, even Iesus Christ the Righteous.</hi> Before
whom doth he appear? Before the Father. And
it is to <hi>him</hi> to whom we direct our Prayers, tho
not excluding the other Persons. <hi>Eph. 3. 14.
I bow my Knees unto the Father of our Lord Iesu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Christ.</hi> Tho it be not unlawful to pray to
Christ, or to the Holy-Ghost; for that hath been
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47528:44"/>
done by the Saints. <hi>Stephen</hi> saith, <hi>Lord Iesus,
receive my Spirit;</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> saith, <hi>The Angel of
the Covenant bless the Lads.</hi> And all baptized Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are baptized in the Name of the Son and
Holy-Ghost, as well as in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But usually <hi>Christian Worship</hi> is terminated
upon God the <hi>Father,</hi> as being chief in the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Redemption; and so it is said, <hi>Eph. 2. 18.
Through him, by one Spirit, we have access to the
Father.</hi> We come to him through <hi>Christ,</hi> as the
<hi>meritorious</hi> Cause, who hath procured <hi>Leave</hi> for
us; and by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the <hi>efficient</hi> Cause, who
gives us an Heart to come; and to the <hi>Father,</hi>
as the <hi>ultimate Object</hi> of Christian Worship. Christ
procureth us Leave to come, and the Spirit gives
us a Heart to come: So that by the Spirit, through
Christ, we have access to God. So that now you
may see what is meant by the <hi>Father; Our
Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now let me distinguish again; God is a
Father to Mankind, either,
<list>
                     <item>1. In a more general consideration and respect,
by Creation; or,</item>
                     <item>2. In a more special regard, by Adoption.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First; By <hi>Creation</hi> God is a Father: At first
he gave a Being to all Things; but to Men and
Angels he gave Reason; <hi>Iohn 1. 4. And this Life
was the Light of Man.</hi> Other Things had Life;
but Man had such a Life as was <hi>Light;</hi> and so by
his original Constitution he became to be the Son
of God. To establish the Relation of a Father,
there must be a Communication of Life and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
A Painter, that makes an Image or Picture
like himself, he is not the Father of it; for tho
there be Likeness, yet no Life. The Sun in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47528:44"/>
of Speech is not the Father of Frogs, and
putrid Creatures, which are quickned by its heat;
tho there be Life, yet there is no Likeness. We
keep this Relation for univocal Generations, and
rational Creatures. Thus by Creation the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
are said to be the Sons of God; <hi>Iob 38. 7.
When he was laying the Foundations of the Earth,
the Sons of God shouted for Ioy;</hi> that is, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
And thus <hi>Adam</hi> also was called the <hi>Son of
God, Luke 3. ult.</hi> Thus by our first Creation,
and with respect to that, all Men are the Sons of
God, Children of God. And (mark it) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of God's continual concurrence to our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
tho we have deformed our selves, and are
not the same that we were; when we were first
created; yet still in regard of some sorry Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of God's Image, and the Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
all are Sons of God, and God in a general
Sence is a Father to us; Yea, <hi>more</hi> a Father than
our natural Parents are: For our Parents, they
concur to our Being but <hi>instrumentally,</hi> God <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally:</hi>
We had our Being under God from our
Parents: He hath the greatest hand and stroke in
forming us in the Belly, and making us to be what
we are. Which appeareth by this: Parents,
they know not what the Child will be, Male or
Female, beautiful or deformed; they cannot tell
the Number of Bones, Muscles, Veines, Arteries;
and cannot restore any of these, in case they
should be lost and spoil'd: So that he that fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
us in the Womb, and wonderfully fashioned
us in the secret Parts, he is our Father, <hi>Psal.
139.</hi> 14. As the Writing is rather the Work of
the Pen-man, than of the Pen; so we are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Workmanship of God, than of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47528:45"/>
They are but Instruments; God is the
Author and Fountain of that Life and Being,
which we still have. And again, consider, The
<hi>better</hi> Part of Man is of his immediate Creation;
and in this respect, he is called the <hi>Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi>
Heb. 12. 19. They do not run in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
of carnal Generation, or fleshly Descent;
but they are immediatly created by God. And
it is said, <hi>Eccles. 12. 7. The Spirit returneth to God
which gave it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, you see how in a <hi>general</hi> Sence,
and with what good reason God may be called,
<hi>Our Father.</hi> Those which we call Fathers, they
are but subordinate Instruments; the most we
have from them is our Corruption, our being
depraved; but our Substance, and the Frame and
Fashion of it, our Being, and all that's good in
it, that's from the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now this is some Advantage in Prayer, to look
upon God as our Father by virtue of Creation,
that we can come to him, as the Work of his
Hands, and beseech him that he will not destroy
us, and suffer us to perish. <hi>Isa. 64. 8. But now,
O Lord, thou art our Father; we are the Clay, and
thou our Potter; and we are all the Work of thine
Hand.</hi> There is a general Mercy that God hath
for all his Creatures; and therefore as he gave
us rational Souls, and fashioned us in the Womb,
we may come to him, and say; Lord, thou art
our Potter, and we thy Clay, do us good, forsake
us not.</p>
               <p>What Advantage have we in Prayer, from this
common Interest, or general Respect of God's
being a Father by virtue of Creation?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:47528:45"/>
1. This common Relation binds us to pray
to him: All things which God hath made, by a
secret Instinct they are carried to God for their
Supply. <hi>Psal. 145. 15. The Eyes of all Things look
up to thee.</hi> In their way they pray to him, and
moan to him for their Supplies, even very Beasts,
young Ravens, and Fowls of the Air. But much
more is this Man's Duty, as we have Reason, and
can clearly own the first Cause. And therefore upon
these natural Grounds the Apostle reasons with
them, why they should seek after God. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 17.</p>
               <p>2. As this common Relation binds us to pray;
so it draweth common Benefits after it. <hi>Mat. 6.
25, 26. Is not the Life more than Meat, and the Body
than Raiment? Behold the Fowls of the Air: for
they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into
Barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.</hi> Christ
saith, where God hath given a Life, he will give
Food; and where he gives a Body, he will give
Raiment, according to his good pleasure. He
doth not cast off the Care of any living Creature
he hath made, as long as he will preserve it for
his Glory. Beasts have their Food and Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
much more Men, which are capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and enjoying God.</p>
               <p>3. It giveth us Confidence in the Power of
God. He which made us out of nothing, is able
to keep, preserve, and supply us, when all things
fail, and in the midst of all Dangers. Saints
are able to make use of this common Relation.
And therefore it is said, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. That we
should <hi>commit our Souls unto him, in well-doing, as
unto a faithful Creator.</hi> The Apostle speaks of
such Times, when they carried their Lives in
their hands, from day to day: They did not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47528:46"/>
know how soon they should be haled before Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals,
and cast into Prisons. Remember, you
have a Creator, which made you out of nothing;
and he can keep and preserve Life, when you have
nothing. Thus this common Relation is not to
be forgotten, as he gives us our outward Life
and Being. <hi>Psal. 124. 8. Our Help is in the Name
of the Lord, who made Heaven and Earth:</hi> As if
the Psalmist had said, As long as I see these glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Monuments of his Power, these Things fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
out of nothing, shall I distrust God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Exigence or Strait I may be reduced to?</p>
               <p>Secondly; More especially, there is a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Sort of Men, to whom God is a Father in
Christ, and that is, to Believers. <hi>Iohn 1. 12. To
as many as received him, to them gave he Power to be
called the Sons of God.</hi> Those which in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
State and Condition were Children of
Wrath, and Slaves to Sin and Satan; when they
come, and are willing to welcom and receive
Christ into their Hearts; in a sense of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
are willing to make out after God and
Christ; they have an Allowance to call God <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and may have Child-like Communion with
him, and run to him in all Straits, and lay open
their Necessities to him. 2 <hi>Kings 4. 19. When the
Child cried unto his Father, he said, Carry him to
his Mother:</hi> So when we are ill at ease, and in
any Straits, this is the Privilege of our Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that we have a God to go to; we may go to
our Father, and plead with him, as the Church,
<hi>Isa. 63. 16. Doubtless thou art our Father, tho</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<hi>be ignorant of us, and</hi> Israel <hi>acknowledge us
not: Thou, O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer.</hi>
It is good to know God under this special Relation
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47528:46"/>
of a Father in Christ; and this is that which is
the Grace of Adoption. Adoption is an Act of
Free-Grace, by which we that were Aliens and
Strangers, Servants to Sin and Satan, are, in
and by Christ, made Sons and Daughters of God,
and accordingly are so reckoned, and treated
with, to all Intents and Purposes. It is a great
and special Privilege, given to God's own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
by virtue of their Interest in Christ; and
therefore it is said, 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 1. Behold what Love
the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be
called the Sons of God!</hi> That is; Behold it as a
certain Truth, and admire it as a great Privilege.
This second Relation is a very great Privilege,
and it will appear to be so, if we consider,</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Persons</hi> that receive it: We that were
Aliens, and Enemies, and Bond-slaves; that
were of another Line and Stock: That might
<hi>say to Corruption, Thou art my Father; to the
Worm, Thou art my Mother, and my Sister.</hi> Job
17. 14. We that were Cousin-Germans to
Worms, a handful of enlivened Dust, that we
should be taken into such a Relation to God!
We that might say indeed to the Devil, Thou art
our Father, and the Lusts of our Father we will
do. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 44. Satan is the Sinners Father,
and God disclaims them. The Lord disclaims
the People which were brought out of the Land
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when they rebelled against him. <hi>Exod.
32. 7. The Lord said unto</hi> Moses, <hi>Go, get th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

down; for thy People which thou broughtest out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>dain,
as if God did disavow them from being hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
And so it was with us all. When <hi>Adam</hi> had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47528:47"/>
against God, God executed the Law of the
rebellious Child against him, which was this,
that he should be turn'd out of Doors. So was
<hi>Adam</hi> turn'd out of Paradise, and lost his Title
and Heritage; and we were reckoned to the
Devil. Now, <hi>behold what manner of Love was
this, that we should be called the Sons of God!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. You will wonder at it, you will behold it as
an excellent Privilege, if you consider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Privilege it self; To be Sons and
Daughters of God, to be able to call God Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This was Christ's own Title and Honour.
When God had a mind to honour Christ, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
it from Heaven, <hi>Mat. 3. 17. This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Son, in whom I am well-pleased.</hi> Surely, if
our Hearts were as apprehensive of heavenly Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,
as they are of earthly, we would admire
it more. Earthly Alliance, how is it prized!
If a great Man should match into our Blood and
Line, what an Honour and Glory do we reckon
it to us! 1 <hi>Sam. 18. 23. Seemeth it to you a light
thing to be a King's Son in Law?</hi> Do we account
this a small Matter, to be related to Kings, and
Princes, and Potentates? No, no; we have
high thoughts of it: And is not this an excellent
thing, to be Sons and Daughters of God? In
all other Cases, if Men have Children of their
own, they do not adopt: God had a Son of his
own, in whom his Soul found full Delight and
Complacency; yet he would adopt and take us
wretched Creatures, he would invest us with the
Title of Sons. And shall it be said of this and
that Believer, Here's the Son of God? <hi>O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
what manner of Love!</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. Then do but consider the <hi>Consequents</hi> of it,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47528:47"/>
both in this Life, and the Life to come. <hi>In this
Life,</hi> what Immunities and Privileges have we?
<hi>Free Access to God;</hi> we may come and treat with
him when we please, as Children to a Father,
when we stand in need of any thing. <hi>We have
received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry,
Abba, Father.</hi> Rom. 8. 15. If we ail any thing,
we may go to our Father, and acquaint him
with our Case and Grief. And we shall have a
<hi>Child's Allowance</hi> here in the World: The Heirs
of Glory are well provided for in their Non-age;
they have a Right to a large Portion, all the good
Things of the World, Meat, Drink, Marriage;
such Things they have by a Son's Right: They
have a Right to the Creature, in and by him who
is Heir of all Things; so they are established in
their Right which <hi>Adam</hi> lost. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4.
And they are under the Ministry of Angels; the
Angels are sent forth to be their Guardians, and
to supply and provide for them.</p>
               <p>And then in the <hi>Life to come,</hi> (for we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Sons,</hi> but <hi>Heirs</hi>) we have a Right to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Inheritance. <hi>Rom. 8. 17. If Children, then
Heirs, Heirs of God.</hi> Here all the Children are
Heirs, Male and Female, every Son and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
an Heir, and Joint-heirs with Christ. We
do as it were divide Heaven between us; we have
a great, blessed, and glorious Inheritance; poor
despicable Creatures, <hi>chosen Heirs of a Kingdom.</hi>
James 2. 5.</p>
               <p>4. You will see it was a very great Privilege,
if you consider how we come to be entitled to it.
Ephes. 1. 5. <hi>Having predestinated us unto the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Children, by Iesus Christ, to himself:</hi> We
come to it in and by Jesus Christ. Christ was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47528:48"/>
fain to come down, and to take a Mother upon
Earth, that we might have a Father in Heaven.
He comes down, and was made a Man; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
our Brother, and so layeth the Foundation
for the Kindred. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11. Nay, not only
<hi>incarnate,</hi> but he <hi>died,</hi> to purchase this Title for
us. When the Business was debated in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of the Trinity, how lost Man might be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Blood, and have a Right and Interest in
God; and when Justice put in Exceptions against
us, Jesus Christ was content to be <hi>made under the
Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi>
Gal. 4. 4, 5. There could be no Reconciliation,
no Amity, no Alliance, until Sin was expiated,
and Justice satisfied: therefore Christ was not
only made of a <hi>Woman,</hi> but made <hi>under the Law;</hi>
first, our Brother by In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rnation, and then our
Redeemer by his Death and Suffering. As under
the Law, if a Man had waxen poor, the next of
Kin was to be his Redeemer; <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 25. Or
if he had sold himself, <hi>v.</hi> 47. one of his Brethren
was to redeem him. Christians, there was a kind
of Sale and Forfeiture, on our part, of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and Right and Title of Children; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Jesus Christ, when he became a Man, <hi>jure
propinquitatis,</hi> by virtue of his Kindred, and
Nearness to us, came to redeem his People, and
purchase us to God. And this is the Relation
which is mainly intended in this place; for mark,
Christ taught his Disciples to pray, <hi>Our Father;</hi>
others, they cannot speak of this Relation; and
in them all that believe, and all that walk in the
Spirit, these alone can come to God as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:47528:48"/>
II. What Advantage have we in Prayer, by
taking up God under this Notion and Relation,
when we can come to him, and say, <hi>Our Father?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. It conduceth to our Confidence in Prayer.</p>
               <p>2. It furthereth our Duty.</p>
               <p>First; It conduceth to our Confidence in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
For it is not an empty Title, or a naked Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
but this is the ground of all that Favour
and Grace which we stand in need of, and receive
from God. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>It is notable, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8. saith God,
<hi>I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my Sons
and Daughters.</hi> In other places it is said, Ye shall
be <hi>called</hi> my Sons; but here, You shall <hi>be</hi> my
Sons; you shall not only be called so, but be so.
He will really perform all the parts of a Father
to us; yea, no Father like God. The outward
Father is but a Shadow; as still in the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
outward Things are but the Shadow and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude,
the Reality is in inward Things: A
Servant is not always a Servant, there may be a
Release; a Husband is not always a Husband,
there may be a Separation by Divorce: but a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is always a Father, and a Child a Child.
<hi>I am the true Vine:</hi> The ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ward Vine is but a
Shadow, but Christ himself hath the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of a Vine: So the outward Father is but
a Shadow and Similitude, the Reality is in God;
none so fatherly and kind as he. <hi>Mat. 7. 11. If
ye being evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your
Children; how much more shall your Father which is
in Heaven, give good Things to them that ask him?</hi>
There is a <hi>how much more</hi> upon the fatherly Care
of God. Natural Parents, whose Affections are
<hi>stinted</hi> and <hi>limited,</hi> nay, <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>sinful,</hi> when a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47528:49"/>
Son comes for a <hi>Fish,</hi> will not give him a <hi>Scorpion;</hi>
when he comes for <hi>Bread,</hi> will not give him a <hi>Stone;</hi>
that were a monstrous thing, vile, and unnatural.
So Isa. 49. 15. <hi>Can a Woman forget her sucking
Child, that she should not have Compassion on the Son
of her Womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
thee.</hi> Passions in Females are more vehement,
the Mother hath stronger Affections; if the Mother
could do so, as totally to forget that ever she had
such a Child, yet she would not forget her <hi>Sucking</hi>
Child; a poor shiftless, helpless Babe, that can
do nothing without the Mother; a Child which
never provoked her, she would not forget such a
Child: they may forget, yet will I not forget
thee. Certainly God which hath left such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon the Hearts of Parents, hath more
of Pity, Bounty, and Goodness in his own Heart;
for whatsoever of God is in the Creature, is in
God in a more eminent manner.</p>
               <p>But particularly, How will God perform the
parts of a Father?</p>
               <p>1. In allowing them full leave to come to him
in all their Necessities, Gal. 1. 6. <hi>Because ye are
Sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your
Hearts, crying, Abba, Father:</hi> There is a Spirit
that attendeth upon this State. They which are
Sons shall have the Spirit of Sons, and God will
incline their Hearts to come and call to him for
Supplies. This is a great Advantage. When he
gives a Spirit of Prayer, then he will be ready to
hear and grant our Requests; not only to give us
a Heart to ask them, but to incline his Ear. Luk.
11. 13. <hi>How much more shall your heavenly Father
give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> When we
ask for the highest Blessing; when we come and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47528:49"/>
are importunate with him, and will take no nay.</p>
               <p>2. In supplying all our Wants. Mat. 6. 32. <hi>Your
Father which is in Heaven, knoweth you have need of
these things.</hi> A Father will not let his Child starve;
certainly none so Fatherly as God: You have
not such a Father as is ignorant, regardless of
your Condition, but takes an exact notice of all
your Wants and Pressures. It is notable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
how God condescendeth to express the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
notice he taketh of the Saints: Isa. 49. 16.
<hi>Behold, I have graven thee upon the Palms of my Hands.</hi>
As we use to tye things about our Hands, that we
may remember such a Work and Business: So
God doth as it were put a print and mark upon
his Hands, to speak after the manner of Men.
Nay, Mat. 10. 30. <hi>The Hairs of their Heads are
numbred;</hi> God hath a particular notice of their
Necessities: And Jesus Christ, he is his Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer,
one that ever appeareth before him to
represent their Wants. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. As the High-Priest,
in the Law, was to go in with the Names
of the Tribes upon his Breast and Shoulder, when
he did minister before God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. Which is
a Type, how much we are in the Heart of Christ,
ever representing himself before the Lord on the
behalf of such and such a Believer.</p>
               <p>3. Pitying our Miseries. As he taketh notice
of them, so he will pity their Miseries; as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pityeth his Children, when he seeth them in
an afflicted Condition. Psal. 103. 13. <hi>Like as a
Father pityeth his Children: So the Lord pityeth them
that fear him.</hi> Nay, he will pardon their Sins.
<hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 3. 17. And, <hi>I will spare them, as a Man spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his own Son which serveth him.</hi> An only Son
needs not fear much, if his Father were to be his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47528:50"/>
Judg, tho he hath done unworthily. They may
exhaust and draw up all their Pity, their Bowels
may shrink when they meet with multitude of
Provocations. Now God will spare us, as a Man
spares his only Son: Nay, not only his only Son,
but his dutiful Son, which serves him. Many
times we forget the Duty of Children, but God
will not forget the Mercy of a Father. <hi>I will go to
my Father,</hi> saith the Prodigal. He had forgotten
the Duty of a Child, he went into a far Country,
and wasted his Patrimony, and that basely and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ilthily upon Harlots; yet upon his Return, when
he was a great way off, <hi>The Father runs to meet him</hi>
half way, <hi>and kisseth him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. In disciplining, and treating us with much
Indulgence, and Wisdom, and Care. A Father
takes a great deal of Pains, in forming his Child,
and fashioning its Manners, and Behaviour: So
doth God with his Children. If he afflicteth, it is
as a Father, only with purposes of good, and not
so as an Earthly Father: Heb. 12. 10. <hi>For verily,
for a few days they chastned us after their own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
but he for our Profit, that we might be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his Holiness.</hi> They mingle a great deal of
Passion with their Correction, when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed;
but God never mingleth Passion with his
Rod: When he gives a bitter Cup, he is a Father
still, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 11.</p>
               <p>5. In providing able Guardians for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
None so attended as God's Children are,
those which are adopted and taken into Grace and
Favour with Christ; Heb. 1. 14. <hi>Angels are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
Spirits, sent abroad for the Heirs of Salvation.</hi>
They have a guard of Angels to watch over them,
that they dash not their Foot against a Stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:47528:50"/>
6. In laying up an Inheritance for them. The
Apostle saith, 2 Cor. 12. 14. <hi>Children ought not to
lay up for their Parents, but Parents for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
Now, God hath laid up for us, as well as
laid out much upon us. Luk. 12. 32. <hi>Fear not, little
Flock, it is your Father's good pleasure to give you
the Kingdom.</hi> He has a Kingdom, a glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
to bestow upon us: And we are kept
for that happy State. Tho he hath an Heir al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
Jesus Christ, the Heir of all things; yet God
hath made us <hi>Co-Heirs with Christ, Rom.</hi> 8. 17.</p>
               <p>Thus, then it is a mighty Advantage: If we did
take up God in this Notion, to look upon him as
a Father, it would increase our Confidence, and
Dependance upon him; This is a sweet Relation;
the Reality is more in God, than can be in an
Earthly Father: for he is a Father according to
his Essence, knowing our Necessities, pardoning
our Sins, supplying our Wants, forming and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioning
our Manners, providing able Guardians
for us, and laying up a blessed Inheritance for us,
in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As it encourageth us to pray, so it
furthereth our Duty in Prayer, that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
our selves with Reverence, Love, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
               <p>1. With a Child-like <hi>Reverence,</hi> and Affection
in Prayer; Mal. 1. 6. <hi>If then I be a Father, where
is mine Honour? And if I be a Master, where is my
Fear?</hi> If we expect the Supplies of Children, we
must perform the Duty of Children. God will be
owned as a Father, not with a Fellow-like Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity,
but humbly, and with an awe of his Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:47528:51"/>
2. With <hi>Love.</hi> Now, our Love to God is
mainly seen by Subjection, and Obedience to his
Laws. Thus Christ would have us take up God
in Prayer, under such a Relation, that we might
mind our Duty to him. 1 Pet. 1. 17. <hi>And if ye call
on the Father, who without respect of Persons judgeth
according to every man's work, pass the time of your
sojourning here in fear.</hi> We never pray aright, but
when we pray resolving to cast off all Sin. How
can we call him Father, whom we care not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to displease from Day to Day? So the Lord
treats his People. Jer. 3. 5, 6. <hi>Thou hast said, thou
art my Father: Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil
things as thou couldest.</hi> God takes it to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely
and Reproach to himself, when we do
evil, yet come and call him Father. He takes it
ill, that Men should come complementally, and
flatter him with Lying Lips, and do not walk as
Children in holy Obedience: Therefore it is an
engagement to serve God with Holiness.</p>
               <p>3. With <hi>Gratitude.</hi> When we come to pray,
we must remember, not only what we want, but
what we have received, acknowledging we have
all from him, he is our Father, Deut. 32. 6. <hi>Do
ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish People, and unwise?
Is not he thy Father that hath bought thee? Hath he
not made thee and established thee?</hi> We must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
the good we have, as well as that we expect
to come from him. Therefore, if we would have
a praying Frame, and be eased of our Sollicitude,
and that anxious care which is a disparagement to
Providence, it is good to take up God under the
Notion of a Father, which makes us rest upon him
for all things. Mat. 6. 25. <hi>Take no thought for your Life,
what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47528:51"/>
Body, what ye shall put on,</hi> Why? <hi>For your heavenly
Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</hi>
You that are able Fathers would take your selves
disparaged, if that your Children should filch and
steal for their Living, and beg, and be sollicitous,
and go up and down from Door to Door for their
Maintenance and Support, and not trust to your
Care and Provision. A Believer, which knoweth
he hath a Heavenly Father, will not be negligent
in his Calling, but be active and industrious in his
way, and use those lawful means which by the
Providence of God he hath been brought up in,
and then, <hi>Be careful for nothing,</hi> as the Apostle's
advice is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. And <hi>in every thing, by Prayer
and Supplication, make your request known unto God.</hi>
O could we turn Carking into Prayer, and run to
our Father, it would be happy for us. Care, and
Diligence, and necessary Provision, that's our
work and labour; but for the Success and Event
of Things, leave it to God. When we are carking
in the World with such anxiousness, and troubled
with restless Thoughts; how we should be provided
for in old Age, and what will become of us and
ours, we take God's work out of his Hands; this is a
disparagement to our Heavenly Father, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to his Providence and Fatherly Care. Well
then, certainly this is of great advantage in Prayer.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> If it be a great advantage in Prayer, to take
up God under the Notion and Relation of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Then those that would pray aright, let this
instruct and quicken them above all things. Clear
up your Adoption, that you may be able to call
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47528:52"/>
God Father, for otherwise when you come to
pray, it is a very Lye to God: As <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 4.
When <hi>Annanias</hi> spake false to the Apostle, saith
<hi>Peter</hi> to him; <hi>Thou hast not lyed unto Men, but unto
God.</hi> Why? Because he knows all that is done in
the World. But much more do they lie unto
God here; this is a very Disgrace and Blasphemy,
a Contumely, rather than a Prayer and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when you will come, and make God to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Devil's Brats: When you that live in
Sin, and have no Reverence and Awe of God upon
your Hearts, shall come and pray to him, this is
a Lye, which is told to the very Face of God.</p>
                  <p>But if this be a Truth, that all those which
would pray aright must clear up their Adoption,
and get a sense of it, then here will Doubts arise.
Therefore, here I shall handle three Cases.</p>
                  <p>1. What shall natural Men do? Must they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
from Prayer? for they have no right to it.</p>
                  <p>2. What shall they do, which have not as yet
received the Testimony of the Spirit? For a
Child of God may have the Right of Children, yet
have not a sense of his Adoption.</p>
                  <p>3. What are the Evidences by which our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
may be cleared up to us, how we may
know we are taken into a Child-like State?</p>
                  <p>First; What shall natural Men do? must they
desist from Prayer? for they have no Right
to it.</p>
                  <p>I answer; You may see here the miserable
Condition of wicked Men, how much they are
bound to pray, and yet what an Impossibility
lieth upon them of praying aright. Certainly
none should desist from this Duty of Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot perform it aright; for tho we
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47528:52"/>
have lost our Power and Fitness, yet there is no
reason God should lose his Right, and his Power
to our Obedience. There is an Obligation and
Precept from God, as a Father by Creation, upon
all Mankind; all which are reasonable Creatures,
they are to own God as a Father in this way.
I say, Prayer is an Homage we owe to God by
natural Right; therefore no doubt wicked Men
do sin, when they cease to pray. It is one of the
Accusations brought against natural Men, and is
an Aggravation of their Sin. <hi>Psal. 14. 1. They
do not call upon God. Rom.</hi> 3. 10. it is applied to
natural Men. This is the Misery they have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
themselves to, that their Prayer is turned
into Sin. As a natural Man must not omit Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
because it is a means to bring him to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with God, tho he cannot hear in Faith:
So he must not omit Prayer, because it is one
Means to bring us to own God as a Father by
Adoption. A Man is not to turn the Back upon
him, but call him Father, as well as he can. <hi>Ier.
3. 19. But I said, How shall I put thee among the
Children, and give thee a pleasant Land, a goodly
Heritage of the Hosts of Nations? And I said,
Thou shalt call me My Father, and shalt not turn
away from me.</hi> Better to own God any way,
than not to own him at all, than not to enquire
after him; to own him rationally, if not spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually;
to own him by Choice, if not out of
Sense. If we cannot come and clear up our Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to this great Privilege by the Spirit of
Adoption; yet any way, <hi>Thou shalt not turn
away from me.</hi> We should not shut the Door
upon our selves. It is required of a natural
Man, being weary of his Sins, to flie to God in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47528:53"/>
Christ Jesus, for his Grace and Favour, that he
might become his God and Father.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; What shall they do, which have
not as yet received the Testimony of the Spirit,
that do not know their Adoption?</p>
                  <p>I answer; A Child of God may have the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and Fruits of Adoption, yet not always the
feeling of it, to witness to him, that God hath
taken him into a Child-like Relation to himself.
Certainly, they are in a very uncomfortable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
for they want an Help in Prayer. <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
thou art our Father;</hi> O what an Advantage is
that! How much of Eloquence and Rhetorick
is there in that, when we can speak to God as a
Father! Yet they are not to neglect their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to God; for this is a means to obtain the
Spirit of Adoption. <hi>Luke 11. 13. He will give
the Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> Therefore in what
ever Condition we be, we must pray; otherwise
we shut the Door upon our Hopes. You continue
the Want upon your selves, and so wholly detain
your selves in a comfortless Condition.</p>
                  <p>There is a fourfold spiritual Art we must use in
Prayer, when we have not the Sense of our Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that we may be able to speak to God as our
Father.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Disclaim,</hi> when you cannot <hi>apply.</hi> When
you cannot clear up your own Relation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
then disclaim all other Confidences. If
thou canst not say, <hi>Father;</hi> yet plead <hi>Fatherless.</hi>
Hos. 14. 3. <hi>In thee the Fatherless find Mercy.</hi>
Come as poor, helpless, shiftless Creatures; seek
Peace and Reconciliation with God in Christ:
It may be, God may take you into his Favour;
He is a Father of the Fatherless.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:47528:53"/>
2. Own God in the humbling way; Learn the
Policy of the Prodigal, <hi>Luke. 15. 18, 19. Father,
I have sinned against Heaven, and before thee, and
am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> This is
the Policy and Art of an humble Faith, to call
God Father. As <hi>Paul</hi> catcheth hold of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
on the dark Side, <hi>Iesus Christ came to save
Sinners;</hi> and presently he addeth, <hi>Whereof I am
chief:</hi> So when a Believer can come, and say,
<hi>Lord, I am not worthy to be called thy Son, make me
as one of thy hired Servants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The third Policy we should use in Prayer,
is, to call him Father in Wish; <hi>Optando, si non
affirmando:</hi> If we cannot do it by direct Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
let us do it by Desire. Let us pray our
selves into this Relation, and groan after it, that
we may have a clearer Sense that God is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Christ.</p>
                  <p>4. Faith hath one Art more, it maketh use of
Christ Jesus. God hath a Son, whose Name sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
much in Heaven; therefore if you cannot
come to him as your Father, come to him as the
God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. <hi>Eph.
3. 14. For this cause I bow my Knees to the God and
Father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Let Christ bring
you into God's presence. He is willing to change
Relations with us. Take him along with you in
your Arms; go to God in Christ's Name: <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
you ask in my Name, shall be given to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly; But what are the Evidences by which
our Adoption may be cleared up to us? How shall
we know that we are taken into a Child-like
State?</p>
                  <p>1. Consider, how it is brought about. How
do we come to be related to God by Christ Jesus?
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47528:54"/>
By receiving Christ, as he is offer'd in the Gospel.
John 1. 12. <hi>To as many as received him, to them
gave he Power to become the Sons of God.</hi> It is a
Prerogative, and special Grant, those which <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>
Christ, even those that <hi>believe</hi> in his Name,
(that is) those who out of a sense of their own
Need, and Sight of Christ offered in the Promise,
do really consent to take him, for the Ends for
which God offereth him, to wit, as Prince and
Saviour, that he might give you Repentance, and
Remission of Sins, not in pretence, but in your
Hearts: These have full liberty to call God Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to come to treat and deal with him; tho
they have not a sense of the Blessedness of their
State, for this followeth Believing: <hi>After you
believed, you were sealed by the holy Spirit of Promise.</hi>
Ephes. 1. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>2. There is a Witness which is given to the
Saints, that the thing may not be always dark
and doubtful: The Holy-Ghost is given as a
Witness. If you would know whether or no you
are the Children of God, see that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<hi>Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit it self beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with our Spirit, that we are the Children of
God.</hi> As under the Law, in the Mouth of two
Witnesses every doubtful Thing was to be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 6. So here, the Spirit beareth
Witness, together with our Spirits, that we are
the Children of God. Our Spirits alone may be
lying, deceitful; we may flatter our selves, and
think we are the Children of God, when we are
Children of the Devil. All certainly comes from
the Holy-Ghost; and therefore the great Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is traversed to and fro in the Heart, is,
Whether we be God's Children? What is the
Spirit's Witness?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:47528:54"/>
(1.) He lays down Marks in Scripture, which
are the Ground and Decision of this Debate; for
the Scriptures are of the Holy-Ghost's inditing,
and so may be said to bear witness. <hi>Rom. 8. 14.
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they
are the Sons of God.</hi> 1 John 3. 10. <hi>In this the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God are manifest, and the Children of the
Devil: Whosoever doth not Righteousness, is not of
God, neither he that loveth not his Brother.</hi> Thus
the Spirit beareth witness to our Spirits, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down such Marks, as we by our own spiritual
Sense, and renewed Conscience, feel to be right
within our selves. And this is the main thing
called the Witness of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>(2.) He worketh such Graces as are peculiar to
God's Children, and are Evidences of our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in the Favour of God: and therefore it is
called, the <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Thess. 2.
13. and the <hi>renewing of the Holy-Ghost,</hi> Tit. 3. 5.
Look as <hi>Iohn</hi> knew Christ to be the Son of God,
by the Spirit's descending and abiding upon him,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 32. So by the Spirit's Work, and the
Spirit's Inhabitation, we know whether we are
the Children of God, or no; whether <hi>we dwell
in God, and God in us, because of his Spirit that he hath
given us,</hi> that is, because of those Graces wrought
in us. And this is called the Seal of the Spirit; for
the Holy-Ghost, stamping the Impress of God
upon the Soul, working in us an answerable Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to Christ, is said to be the Seal; then we
have God's Impress upon us.</p>
                  <p>(3.) The Spirit goes further; he helpeth us to
feel and discover those Acts in our selves. There
is a stupid Deadness in the Conscience, so that
we are not always sensible of our spiritual Acts.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47528:55"/>
                     <hi>Hagar</hi> saw not the Fountain near her, until God
opened her Eyes: So we may not see the Work
of the Spirit, without the Light of the Spirit.
We cannot own Grace in the midst of so much
Weakness and Imperfection, there is a misgiving
of Conscience; therefore the Spirit of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is also a Spirit of Revelation. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 17.
The Author of the Grace, is the best Revealer
and Interpreter of it: He works, and he gives
us a sight of it. As a Workman that made a
thing, can best warrant it to the Buyer; he
knows the Goodness and Strength of it, and
how it is framed and made: So the Holy-Ghost,
which works Grace, he reveals and discovers this
Grace to us.</p>
                  <p>(4.) The Spirit helps us to compare them with
the Rule, and accordingly to judg of their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.
The Spirit opens our Understandings,
that we may be able to discern the Intent and
Scope of the Scripture, that so we may not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken.
We must plow with God's Heifer, if we
would understand the Riddle. <hi>In thy Light, we
shall see Light.</hi> We shall be apt to misapply the
Rule, so as to judg of our own Actions. <hi>Rom.
9. 1. I lie not, the Holy-Ghost bearing me witness;</hi>
when he had spoken of some eminent Thing
wrought in him. We are apt to lie, and feign
and misapply Rules, Comforts, and Privileges:
But now the Holy-Ghost bearing witness with our
Spirits, by this means we come to have a Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
There are so many Circuits, Wiles, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
in the Heart of Man, that we are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Judges of what is wrought in us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is usually ascribed to the Spirit to be the
Searcher of the Heart. <hi>Psal. 139. 7. Whither
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47528:55"/>
shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee
from thy Presence?</hi> Acts 5. 4. <hi>Thou hast not lied
unto Men, but unto God.</hi> The Holy-Ghost is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
spoken of, than any other Person, because
it is his personal Operation to abide in the Hearts
of Men, and to search and try the Reins: It is
more particularly ascribed to him, tho it belongs
to all the Persons.</p>
                  <p>(5.) As the Spirit helps us to compare that which
is wrought with the Rule, the impression or
thing sealed with the Stamp or the thing sealing;
so he helps us to conclude rightly of our Estate:
For many times when the Premises are clear, the
Conclusion may be suspended, either out of Self-Love,
in case of Condemnation; or out of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Fear and Jealousy, in case of Self-acquitment.
Therefore the Conclusion is of the Holy-Ghost.
1 John 4. 13. <hi>Hereby we know that we dwell in him,
and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</hi>
There's a great deal of do to bring us to Heaven
with Comfort. There needs a Person of the
Godhead to satisfy us, as well as to satisfy God,
and help us to determine concerning our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>(6.) He enlivens and heightens our Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in all these Particulars, and so fills us with
Comfort, and raiseth our Joy upon the feeling of
the Sense of the Favour of God; for all this is
the Fruit of his Operation. Therefore it is said,
<hi>Rom. 5. 5. The Love of God is shed abroad in our
Hearts, by the Holy-Ghost which is given unto us.</hi>
Those unspeakable Glimpses of God's Favour,
and sweet Manifestations of God's Love in the
Conscience, which we have, these are given by
the Holy-Ghost. There is not one Act of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47528:56"/>
Soul, but the Holy-Ghost hath a stroke in it for
our Comfort, in every degree, all comes from
God. So that if you would know what the
Witness of the Spirit is, consider, What are the
Marks in Scripture? What Graces are wrought
in your Hearts? How doth the Spirit help you
to discern those Graces, to compare them to the
Rule, to make accordingly in these Things a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of our Condition? And what Joy
and Peace have you thereupon wrought in your
Hearts by the Holy-Ghost? For an immediate
Testimony of the Spirit, the Scripture knows of
no such thing. All other is but Delusion, besides
this.</p>
                  <p>(3.) There are certain Fruits and Effects, which
do more sensibly evidence it unto the Soul. What
are those Fruits of the Spirit of Adoption in our
Hearts, by which we may further evidence it,
whether we are the Children of God, or no?</p>
                  <p>(1.) In Prayer, by a kind of Naturalness or
Delight in this Duty of holy Commerce with
God. <hi>Rom. 8. 15. We have received the Spirit of
Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</hi> Gal. 4. 6.
<hi>Because ye are Sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit
of his Son into your Hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</hi>
And, <hi>Zech. 12. 10. I will pour upon the House of</hi>
David, <hi>and upon the Inhabitants of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>the
Spirit of Grace, and of Supplication.</hi> Where-ever
the Spirit of God is dispensed, and dwelleth in the
Hearts of any, the Heart of that Man will be
often with God: The Spirit of Grace will put
him upon Supplication; he will be often acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
God with his Desires, Wants, Fears.</p>
                  <p>(2.) You will be mainly carried out to your
Inheritance in Heaven. Those which are the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47528:56"/>
Children of God, do look after a Child's Portion;
and will look for an Estate in Heaven, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be satisfied with present Things. Worldly
Men, they have their Reward. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 2 They
discharge God for other Things; If they may
have Plenty, Honour, worldly Ease, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
here, they never look after Heaven. As a
Servant hath his Reward from Quarter to
Quarter, but a Child waits until the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
comes: So when we are begotten for
this lively Hope, when there is an Heavenly-mindedness
in you, this is a Fruit of the Holy-Ghost
wrought in the Heart, by which you might
know you are the Sons of God. <hi>Rom. 8. 23. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the First-Fruits of the Spirit, we groan within
our selves, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of our Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) By a Child-like Reverence and Dread of
God; when we are afraid to offend God. <hi>Ier.
35.</hi> 5, 6. The Sons of <hi>Rechab,</hi> their Father had
commanded them that they should drink no
Wine; now saith God by the Prophet, <hi>Set Pots
full of Wine, and Cups, and say unto them, Drink
ye Wine:</hi> That is, present the Temptation.
No, they would not; <hi>Our Fathers have forbidden
us.</hi> So, when a Child of God is put upon Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
his Heart recoils, and reasons thus; <hi>How
can I do this Wickedness, and sin against God?</hi> I
dare not, my Father hath forbidden me. There
is an Awe of his Heavenly Father upon him.
1 Pet. 1. 17. <hi>If you call on the Father, who without
respect of Persons, judgeth according to every Man's
Work; pass the Time of your sojourning here in
Fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:47528:57"/>
We now come to speak of the Possessive Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
[<hi>Our] Father.</hi> The Word is used for a
double Reason:
<list>
                        <item>1. To comfort us in the Sense of our Interest
in God.</item>
                        <item>2. To mind us of the common Interest of all
the Saints in the same God: It is not <hi>my,</hi> or <hi>thy</hi>
Father only, but <hi>our</hi> Father.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>First; Observe the great Condescension of
Christ, that poor Creatures are allowed to claim
an Interest in God. If Christ had not put these
Words in our Mouths, we never had had Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to have gone to God, and said, <hi>Doubtless,
thou art our Father.</hi> But he which was in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of God, and knew his Secrets, hath told us,
it is very pleasing to God, we should use this
Compellation to him. This is a Privilege which
cannot be sufficiently valued, if we consider,
<list>
                        <item>1. The Unworthiness of the Persons which
enjoy it; poor Dust and Ashes, sinful Creatures,
that were Children of the Devil, that we should
lay Claim and Title to God for our Father!
And,</item>
                        <item>2. If we consider the Greatness of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
it self: <hi>O behold what manner of Love the
Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called
his Children!</hi> 1 John 3. 1. We think it much,
when we can say, This Field, this House is mine;
but surely this is more, to say, this God is mine.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again; Observe here, That Interest is a ground
of Audience. So Christ would have us begin our
Prayers, <hi>Our Father;</hi> God's Interest in us, and
our Interest in God. <hi>God's Interest in us:</hi> When
Christ mediates for his Disciples, he saith, <hi>Ioh. 17. 6.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47528:57"/>
Thine they were, and thou gavest them me.</hi> And
<hi>David, Psal. 119. 94. I am thine, save me:</hi> That's
his Argument; the Reason is, Because God, by
taking them for his own, binds himself to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and keep them. Every Body is bound to
look to his own. <hi>He that provides not for his own,
is worse than an Infidel.</hi> Now what a sweet thing
is it, when we can go to God, and say, we are
thine. So it is the same, as to <hi>our Interest in God;</hi>
it is an excellent Encouragement. <hi>Psal. 42. 11.
Hope thou in God,</hi> saith <hi>David</hi> to his Soul; why?
for he is <hi>my</hi> God. And elsewhere, reasoning
with himself, <hi>Psal. 23. 1. The Lord is my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
I shall not want:</hi> First, his Covenant-Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
is built, and then Conclusions of Hope. So
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. David <hi>encouraged himself in the Lord
his God.</hi> It is sweet, when we can go to God, as
<hi>our</hi> God. <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to say, God was
known better by the Predicament of Relation,
than by his natural Properties. Why is Interest
such a sweet thing? Because by this Relation to
God, we have a Claim to God, and to all that he
can and will do. God hath made over himself,
<hi>quantus quantus est,</hi> as great as great he is, for his
Use and Comfort. Therefore the Psalmist saith,
Psal. 16. 5. <hi>The Lord is the Portion of mine Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and of my Cup.</hi> A Believer hath as sure a
Right and Title to God, as a Man hath to his
Patrimony, to which he is born. Look as the
Right was any <hi>Israelite</hi> had to that Share which
came to him by Lot; so we may lay claim to God,
and live upon his Power and Goodness, as a Man
doth upon his Estate.</p>
                  <p>Well then, labour to see God is yours, if you
would find acceptance with him. It is not enough
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47528:58"/>
to know the Goodness and Power of God in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
but we must discern our Interest in him;
that we may not only say, <hi>Father,</hi> but <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
It is the Nature of Faith, thus to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
and apply. <hi>Iohn 20. 28. My Lord, and
my God.</hi> How is God made ours? How shall we
know it, that we may come and lay our Claim
to him? Behold, Christ teacheth us here to say,
<hi>Our Father,</hi> by taking hold of his Covenant;
and this is God's Covenant-Notion, <hi>I will be your
God, and you shall be my People.</hi> When we give
up our selves to be God's, then he is ours. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
and Appropriation go together. <hi>I am
my Beloved's;</hi> there's the Resignation of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
<hi>And he is mine;</hi> there's the Appropriation
of Faith. A Believer cannot always say, <hi>God is
his,</hi> but, <hi>I am thine;</hi> however it be with him, he
would be no others but the Lord's. If he cannot
say, he is God's, by an <hi>especial</hi> interest; yet he
will be God's, by the resignation of his own
<hi>Vows.</hi> He knows God hath a better Right and
Title to him, than he hath to himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But how shall we know that we do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
resign up our selves to God?</p>
                  <p>I answer; When we make him our chief Good,
and our utmost End, (that is) when we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly
chuse him for our Portion, and set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
our selves to act for his Glory.</p>
                  <p>1. When we chuse and cleave to him, as our
all-sufficient Portion: <hi>The Lord is my Portion,
saith my Soul.</hi> Lam. 3. 24. Sometimes the Lord
speaks to us, <hi>I am thy Reward, I am thy Salvation,</hi>
Psal. 35. 3. So the Soul speaks to God, <hi>Thou art
my Portion.</hi> When we cleave to God, <hi>He is my
Portion for ever,</hi> Psal. 73. 25. <hi>Whom have I in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47528:58"/>
Heaven but thee?</hi> &amp;c. When our Souls are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in God, having enough in him; this is to
give up our selves to him.</p>
                  <p>2. When we set apart our selves to his Use, to
live and act for his Glory; this is also entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Covenant with God. As in that formal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial
Covenant, that was used between the
Prophet and his Wife, <hi>Hos. 3. 3. Thou shalt not
be for another Man, so will I also be for thee:</hi> So
in the Covenant, we resolve to renounce all others,
and to live and act for God. <hi>The Lord hath set
apart him that is godly for himself.</hi> Psal. 4. 3.
When we are thus set apart for God, to serve
him, and glorify him, by this special Dedication
of our selves to his Use; this is the Act of Grace
on our part. We were God's by Election; but
he comes and takes possession for himself by the
Spirit, and then the Soul sets himself apart for
God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; That all the Saints have a common
Interest in the same God; therefore Christ taught
us to say, <hi>Our Father.</hi> They have <hi>one Father,</hi> as
well as <hi>one Spirit, one Christ, one Hope,</hi> and <hi>one
Heaven.</hi> Eph. 4. 6. Questionless, it is lawful to
say, <hi>My</hi> Father. Some have disputed it, because
they suppose this Expression is used to signify
Christ's singular Filiation; Christ could only
say, <hi>My Father.</hi> But it is lawful, provided we
do not say it exclusively, and appropriating it to
our selves. But here Christ, when he giveth us
this perfect Form, teacheth us to say, <hi>Our Father.</hi>
As the Sun in the Firmament is every Man's,
and all the World's; so God is every single Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's
God, the God of all the Elect. But why
would Christ put this in this perfect Patern and
Form of Prayer?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:47528:59"/>
1. To quicken our Love to the Saints in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
When we come to pray, there must be a
<hi>brotherly</hi> Love expressed; now that's a distinct
thing from <hi>common</hi> Love: <hi>Add to brotherly Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Charity.</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 7. When we are dealing
with God in Prayer, we must express somewhat
of this brotherly Love: How must we express
it? In praying for others, as well as for our
selves. <hi>Necessity</hi> will put Men upon praying for
themselves; but brotherly Love will put them
upon praying for others. Wherein must Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
Kindness be expressed in Prayer? In two
Things:</p>
                  <p>(1.) In a Fellow-feeling of their Miseries, in
being touched with their Necessities, as we would
be with our own. To be sensless, it is a spiritual
Excommunication, a casting our selves out of the
Body. Members must take care for one another.
We must be grieved with their Pains: <hi>Who is
offended,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>and I burn not?</hi> If
there be any Power in such a Confession, or Title
of a Father, we must be wrestling with God,
how well soever it be with us, remembring we
speak to him, in whom others have a joint Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
with our selves.</p>
                  <p>(2.) It must be expressed, in wishing the same
good to others, as to our selves. Many that pray
in their own Case, with what Earnestness and
Importunity are they carried out! but how flat
and cold in the Case of others! Now a good
Christian must be as earnest with God for others,
as for himself. Look what Earnestness and Heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of Soul he sheweth, when he puts up Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for himself; the same must he do <hi>for all Saints.
Ephes.</hi> 6. 18. Self-love, and Self-respect must not
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47528:59"/>
breath only in our Prayers; they must be carried
out with as much Earnestness, as if we would go
to God in our own Case.</p>
                  <p>2. Again; As it sheweth us what brotherly
Love we should express in Prayer; so it checketh
many carnal Dispositions, which we are guilty
of, and Christ would mind us of them. It checks
<hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Contention;</hi> we are Brethren, have one
common Father. Every where <hi>Meekness</hi> and
<hi>Love,</hi> it is a Qualification for Prayer. <hi>Let the
Husband live with his Wife according to Knowledg,
that their Prayers be not hindred.</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 7. If
there be such Brauls in the Family, how can the
Husband and Wife call upon God with such an
united Heart as is requisite? So, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 8. I
will that Men pray every where, lifting up holy Hands,
without wrath and doubting.</hi> Not only lift up <hi>pure</hi>
Hands to God, and that without <hi>doubting;</hi> there
must be Confidence in our Prayers: But that's
not all, but without <hi>wrath;</hi> there must be nothing
of Revenge and Passion mingled with your Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.
And then it checketh <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</hi>
Christ teacheth all, in all Conditions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Masters or Servants, Fathers or Children,
Kings or Beggars, all to say, <hi>Our Father;</hi> for we
have all one Father. Thou hast not a better Christ,
nor a better Father in Heaven, than they have.
The Rich and the Poor were to give one Ransom
under the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30 to shew they have all
the same Redeemer. The Weak should not despise
nor disdain the Strong, nor the Rich be ashamed to
own the Poor as Brethren. We should never be
ashamed to own him as a Brother, whom God
will own as a Son.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>W</hi>E have considered the Title given to
God, with respect to his Goodness and

let us consider the Titles given to him, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to his Greatness and Majesty, [<hi>Which art in

               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> It is an Advantage in Prayer, to look upon
God as a Father in Heaven.</p>
               <p>By way of Explication, to shew,</p>
               <p>First; What is meant by Heaven. There are
three Heavens in the Computation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
There is, first, the lowest Heaven, that
where the Fowls of the Air are, whence the Rain
descendeth; therefore the Fowls are called the
<hi>Fowls of Heaven,</hi> Job. 35. 11. And, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 18.
Elijah <hi>prayed, and the Heaven gave Rain.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the Luminary Heaven, where the Sun,
Moon, and Stars are: Therefore it is said,
<hi>Mat. 10. 25. The Stars of Heaven shall fall.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there is the <hi>highest Heaven,</hi> or the Heaven of
the Blessed, spoken of, <hi>Mat. 7. 21. Not every one
that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that is, into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the glorious Heaven, the blessed Presence of
God. Mat. 18. 10. <hi>In Heaven, their Angels do
always behold the Face of my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
[In Heaven,]</hi> that is, the <hi>third Heaven;</hi>
so it is called by <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 2. Which was
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47528:60"/>
the highest Part, because he saw and heard Things
which it is not lawful for a Man to utter. In this
Heaven God is.</p>
               <p>Secondly; How is God there, since he is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where?</p>
               <p>1. Negatively; It is not to be understood so,
as if he were included in Heaven, or locally cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed
within the Compass of it; <hi>For the
Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him,</hi> 1 Kin. 8. 27.
In regard of his Essence, he is in all Places, being
infinite and indivisible: He is not included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Heavens, nor excluded from Earth, but
filleth all Places alike. <hi>Ier. 23. 24. Do not I fill
Heaven and Earth? saith the Lord.</hi> But yet in an
especial manner is God present in Heaven: <hi>That</hi>
appears, because there is his Throne: <hi>Psal.
103. 19. He hath prepared his Throne in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi>
Earthly Kings, they have their Thrones
exalted higher than other Places; but God's
Throne is above all, it is in Heaven. He hath a
more universal and unlimited Empire, than all
the Kings of the Earth; so he hath a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Throne. Heaven is the most convenient
Place, to set forth his Majesty and Glory to the
World, because of the Sublimity, Amplitude,
and Purity of it. And so, <hi>Isa. 66. 1. Thus saith
the Lord, The Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth
is my Footstool.</hi> Heaven is his Throne, because
there is his Majestical Presence, more of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Excellency is discovered: And the Earth
is his Footstool, because there, in the lowest part
of the World, he manifesteth his powerful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
among the lower Creatures.</p>
               <p>Briefly, to conceive how God is in Heaven, we
must consider,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47528:61"/>
1. The several ways of his Presence: He is
in <hi>Christ,</hi> hypostatically, essentially, or (as the
Apostle speaks) <hi>bodily;</hi> Col. 2. 19. <hi>The Fulness
of God dwells in him bodily.</hi> In the <hi>Temple</hi> under
the Law, there God was present symbolically,
because there were the Signs and Tokens of his
Presence. The Jewish Temple was a Sacramental
Place, and Type of Christ, in whose Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and by whose Merit, Worship was acceptable to
God. But now in Christians, he is present ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getically,
and operatively, by his Spirit. And in
<hi>Heaven,</hi> he there dwells by some eminent Effects
of his Wisdom, Power, Greatness, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
God hath shewed more of his Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in the Structure of the Heavens, than in any
other part of the Creation, that being the most
glorious part of the World. <hi>Psal. 19. 1, 2, 3.
The Heavens declare the Glory of the Lord, and the
Firmament sheweth his handy Work,</hi> &amp;c. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is meet, God should dwell in the most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
part of the World; now Heaven is the most
glorious part of the Creation. Heathens in their
Straits would not look to the Capitol, where their
Idols were; but to Heaven, where God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
his Majesty and Greatness. When ever
we look upon these aspectable Heavens, the vast
Expansion of those glorious Luminaries, the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Matter, and Sublimity of its Posture,
it cannot but raise our Hearts to think of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
God that dwelleth there. When we come
by a poor Cottage, we guess the Inhabitant is no
great Person; but when we see a magnificent
Structure, we easily imagine some Person of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
dwells there: So, tho the Earth doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the Glory of God, and shew much of his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47528:61"/>
Wisdom and Power, yet chiefly the Heavens,
when ever we look upon them, we cannot chuse
but have awful Thoughts, and be struck with a
Religious Horrour, at the remembrance of the
great God, which hath stretched out these Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
by his Wisdom and Power.</p>
               <p>2. Therefore God is said to dwell in Heaven,
because from thence he manifesteth his powerful
Providence, Wisdom, Justice, and Goodness. God is
not so shut up in Heaven, as not to mind human
Affairs, and to take notice of what is done here
below: Psal. 11. 4. <hi>The Lords Throne is in Heaven:
His Eyes behold, his Eye-lids try the Children of Men.</hi>
Tho his Throne be in Heaven, yet his Providence
is every where, <hi>his Eyes behold,</hi> he seeth how we
behave our selves in his Presence; and <hi>his Eye-lids
try the Children of Men:</hi> He may seem to wink
now and then, and to suspend the strokes of his
Vengeance, but it is but for our Trial. He own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Children from Heaven, Deut. 26. 15. <hi>Look
down from thy holy Habitation, from Heaven, and
bless thy People.</hi> And from thence he punisheth the
Wicked, Rom. 1. 18. <hi>The Wrath of God is revealed
from Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. There is God most owned by the Saints
and glorified Angels, therefore he is said to dwell
there; as a King is beloved by his Subjects, but
most immediately served and attended upon by
those of his own Court. So that in Heaven, there
we have the highest Pattern of all that Duty
which doth immediately concern God. In this
Prayer, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name, thy Kingdom come,
thy Will be done;</hi> these three Petitions concern
God more immediately; now before we put them
up, Christ would have us think of our Father in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47528:62"/>
Heaven, praised by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>ition.</p>
               <p>4. There God is most enjoyed, and therefore
he dwells there, for there he doth more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
exhibit the fulness of his Glory to the Saints
and Angels. In Heaven God is all in all. Here
we are supplied at second or third Hand. Hos. 2.
18. <hi>I will hear the Heavens, and the Heavens shall
hear the Earth, &amp;c.</hi> But there God is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
and fully enjoyed. Here there are many
Wants and Vacuities to be filled up; <hi>But in thy
Presence there is fulness of Ioy, and at thy right hand
there are Pleasures for evermore,</hi> Psal. 16. 11. Look,
as when the Flood was poured out upon the
World, you read, that <hi>the Windows of Heaven
were opened,</hi> Gen. 7. 11. The drops of Rain were
upon Earth, but the Cataracts and Flood-Gates
were in Heaven: So when he raineth down drops
of Sweetness upon his People, the Flood-Gates are
above, they are reserved for that place where they
are fully enjoyed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Why hath God fixed and taken up
his dwelling place in the Heavens? I answer,</p>
               <p>1. Because mortal Men they cannot endure his
glorious presence. Deut. 5. 23. <hi>When ye heard the
Voice out of the midst of the Darkness, for the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
did burn with Fire, ye said, Behold, the Lord our
God hath shewed us his Glory, and his Greatness, and
we have heard his Voice out of the midst of the Fire:
now therefore why should we dye? For this great Fire
will consume us; if we hear the Voice of the Lord our

of God, how easily do they over-set, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
us? A little Spiritual Enjoyment it is too
strong for us. If God pour out but a drop of
Sweetness into the Heart, we are ready to cry
out, Hold, Lord, it is enough; Our crazy Vessels
can endure no more. Therefore, when Christ
was transfigured, the Disciples were astonished,
and fell back; they could not endure the Emissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Beamings out of his Divine Glory, because
of the Weakness and Incapacity of the present
State; therefore hath God a place above, where he
discovereth his Glory in the utmost Latitude. It
is notable, in Scripture, sometimes God is said
<hi>to dwell in Light, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 16. And sometimes <hi>to
make Darkness his dwelling place, Psal.</hi> 18. 11. How
doth he dwell in Light, and how in Dark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ess?
Because of the glorious mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>estations which are
above, therefore it is said he dwells in <hi>Light;</hi> and
because of the weakness and incapacity of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
therefore he is said to dwell in <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. To try our <hi>Faith,</hi> and our <hi>Obedience,</hi> that he
might see whether we would live by Faith, yea or
no; whether a Believer would love him, and obey
him, tho he were invisible, and withdrawn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Curtain of Heaven. You know when the
<hi>Israelites</hi> saw the Glory of God, then they cryed,
<hi>All that God hath commanded us we will do, Deut. 5.
27.</hi> But as soon as that Manifestation ceased, they
were as bad as ever. If all were liable to Sense,
there would be no trial of this World; but God
hath shut up himself, that by this means the <hi>Faith</hi>
of the Elect might be manifested; for <hi>Faith is the
Evidence of things not seen, Heb.</hi> 11. 1. Where
there is no sight there is exercise for Faith. And
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47528:63"/>
that our Love might be tried, 1 Pet. 1. 8. <hi>Whom
having not seen, ye love: in whom tho now ye see him
not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable, and
full of Glory.</hi> And this is that which discovereth
the Faithless and disobedient World. Job 22. 12,
13, 14. <hi>Is not God in the height of Heaven? How
doth God know? Can he judg through the dark Cloud?
Thick Clouds are a Covering to him that he seeth not,
and he walketh in the circuit of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. It is fit there should be a better place, into
which the Saints should be translated, when the
course of their Obedience is ended. Eph. 1. 3. <hi>He
hath blessed us with Spiritual Blessings in Heavenly Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
The main of Christ's Purchase we have in
Heavenly Places. It is fit the place of Trial and
place of Recompence should differ: therefore the
place of Trial, that's God's Foot-stool; and the
place of Recompence, that's God's Throne. The
World, that's a place of Trial, it is a Common Inn
for Sons and Bastards, for the Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
a Receptacle of Man and Beast: Here God
will shew his <hi>Bounty</hi> unto all his Creatures. But
now in the place of his Residence, he will show
his <hi>Love</hi> to his People. Therefore when we have
been tried and exercised, there is a place of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
for us.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, What Advantage have we in Prayer
by considering God in Heaven? Very much,
whether we consider God absolutely, or with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to a Mediator; both ways we have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>First, If we consider the Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghost,
who have their Residence in Heaven;
consider them without respect to a Mediator.
Why, the looking up to God in Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:47528:63"/>
1. It sheweth us, that Prayer is an act of the
Heart, and not of the Lips; that it is not the
sound of the Voice which can pierce the Heavens,
and enter into the Ears of the Lord of Hosts, but
Sighs and Groans of the Spirit. Christians, in
Prayer God is near to us, and yet far from us;
for we must look upon him as in Heaven, and we
upon Earth. How then should we converse with
God in Prayer? Not by the Tongue only, but by
the Heart. The Commerce and Communion of
Spirits is not hindred by local Distance: but God
is with us, and we with him, when our Heart go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up.</p>
               <p>2. It teacheth, the great work of Prayer is to
lift up the Heart to God; To withdraw the
Heart from all created things which we see and
feel here below, that we may converse with God
in Heaven. Psal. 123. 1. <hi>Vnto thee lift I up mine
Eyes, O thou that dwellest in the Heavens.</hi> And, Lam.
3. 41. <hi>Let us lift up our Heart with our Hands unto
God in the Heavens.</hi> Prayer doth not consist in a
multitude and clatter of Words, but in the getting
up of the Heart to God, that we may behave
our selves as if we were alone with God, in the
midst of glorious Saints and Angels. There's a
double Advantage which we have by this getting
the Soul into Heaven in Prayer: It's a means to
free us from Distractions, and Doubts. To free
us from <hi>Distractions</hi> and other inter-current
Thoughts. Until we get our Hearts out of the
World, as if we were dead and shut up to all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
things, how easily is the Heart carried away
with the Thoughts of earthly Concernments?
Until we can separate and purge our Spirits, how
do we interline our Prayers with many ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47528:64"/>
Thoughts? It is too usual for us to deal with
God, as an unskilful Person that will gather a
Posy for his Friend, and puts in as many, or
more, stinking Weeds, than he doth choice Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
The Flesh interposeth, and our carnal
Hearts interline and interlace our Prayers with
vain Thoughts and earthly Distractions. When
with our Censor we come to offer Incense to God,
we mingle Sulphur with our Incense. Therefore
we should labour, all that we can, to get the Heart
above the World, into the Presence of God, and
company of the Blessed, that we may deal with
him, ad if we were by him in Heaven, and were
wholly swallowed up of his Glory. Tho our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are on Earth, yet our Spirits should be with
our Father in Heaven. For want of practising
this in Prayer, these Distractions encrease upon
us. So for <hi>Doubts,</hi> when we look to things below,
even the very manifestations of God to us upon
Earth, we have many Discouragements; Dangers
without, and Difficulties within: till we get above
the Mists of the lower World, we can see nothing
of Clearness and Comfort; but when we can get
God and our Hearts together, then we can see
there is much in the Fountain, tho nothing in the
Stream; and tho little on Earth, yet we have a
God in Heaven.</p>
               <p>3. This impresseth an Awe and Reverence, if
we look upon the Glory of God manifested in
Heaven, that Bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ht and Luminous Place. This
is urged by the Holy-Ghost, Eccles. 5. 2. <hi>Thou art
upon Earth, and God is in Heaven; therefore let thy
Words be few.</hi> Gen. 8. 27. <hi>Who am I that I should
take upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but Dust
and Ashes?</hi> We are poor crawling Worms, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47528:64"/>
therefore when we think of the Majesty of God,
it should impress an holy awe upon us. Mean
Persons will behave themselves with all Honour
and Reverence, when they supplicate to Men of
Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lity; So should we to God, who is so High
and so much above us, he is in Heaven. It is a
Diminution of his Greatness, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 14. when
we put off God with any thing, and come slightly
and carelesly into his Presence.</p>
               <p>4. It teacheth us, that all our Prayers should
carry a Correspondence with our great Aim.
What's our great Aim? To be with God in
Heaven, as remembring that's the Center and
Place of our Rest, to which we are all tending.
Col. 3. 1. <hi>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those
Things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the
right-hand of God.</hi> We come to our Father which
is in Heaven; He will have his Residence there,
that our Hearts might be there. Therefore the
main things we should seek of God from Heaven,
are Saving-Graces; for <hi>these come down from above,
from the Father of Lights.</hi> Jam. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 17. We have
liberty to ask Supplies for the outward Life, but
chiefly we should ask spiritual and heavenly
Things. <hi>Mat. 6. 22, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>3. Your heavenly Father
knoweth that ye have need of all these Things:</hi> What
then? <hi>First seek the Kingdom of God,</hi> &amp;c. If we
have to do with a heavenly Father, our first and
main Care should be to ask Things suitable to his
Being, and his Excellency. If Children should
ask of their Parents, such a thing as is pleasing
to their Palate, possibly they might give it them;
but when they ask Instruction, and desire to be
taught, that's far more acceptable to them. When
we ask Supplies of the outward Life, Food, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47528:65"/>
God may give it us; but it is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to him, when we ask for Grace. In every
Prayer, we should seek to be made more heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by conversing with our heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>5. It giveth us ground of Confidence in God's
Power, and absolute Dominion over all Things;
for God is in Heaven, above all created Beings.
Psal. 115. 3. <hi>Our God is in the Heavens, and doth
whatsoever he pleaseth.</hi> So, 2 Chron. 20. 6. <hi>Art
not thou God in Heaven? And rulest not thou over
all the Kingdoms of the Heathen? And in thine
hand is there not Power and Might, so that none is
able to withstand thee?</hi> O what an Advantage is
this in Prayer, when we think of our All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
God, who made Heaven and Earth, and
hath fixed his Throne there! What can be too
hard for him?</p>
               <p>6. Here is Encouragement against carnal Fear.
Whatever the World doth against us, we have a
Father in Heaven, and this should bear us up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all their Threatnings and Oppositions.
When there were Tumults and Confusions in the
World, it is said, <hi>Psal. 2. 4. But God which sits
in Heaven, shall laugh them to Scorn.</hi> An earthly
Parent may have a large Heart, but a short Hand;
tho they may wish us well, yet they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
us, and bear us out in all Extremities: But
our Father in Heaven will laugh at the Attempts
against his Empire and Greatness. Thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
God absolutely, it is an Advantage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon him as a Father in Heaven.</p>
               <p>But I suppose this Expression hath respect to a
Mediator. Therefore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let us look upon God with respect
to a Mediator; for so I think we are chiefly bound,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47528:65"/>
to consider our Father in Heaven, because of
Christ, which sits there at his right-hand. <hi>Heb.
8.</hi> 1. It is said there, <hi>He sate down on the right-hand
of the Throne of the Majesty in the Heavens, a
Minister of the Sanctuary.</hi> O this is comfortable
to think of: In Heaven we have a Saviour, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, representing our Persons, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
our Prayers to God, by which means
God is reconciled and well pleased with us. So
that our Duty in Prayer is, to look up to Heaven,
and to see Christ at God's right-hand, as or
High-Priest, mediating for us, that we may be
accepted with God.</p>
               <p>A notable Resemblance we have between God's
Presence in the Tabernacle or Temple, and God's
Presence in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the Temple you know there were three Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions:
There was to outward Court; and
the Sanctuary, as the Apostle calls it, where the
Table of Shew-bread was set; and there was
the holy Place, the Holy of Holies. Just so in
Heaven there are three Partitions; there is the
Airy Heaven, and the Starry Heaven, and the
Heaven of Heavens: The lower Heaven, which
answers to the outward Court; the Starry Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which answers to the Sanctuary; and the
Heaven of Heavens, which answers to the Holy
of Holies, by a fit Analogy and Proportion.
Well, <hi>In the Holy of Holies,</hi> saith the Apostle,
<hi>there was the Golden Censer, and the Mercy-Seat;</hi>
Heb. 9, 4. There you find God conspicuously
manifesteth his Presence, and give Answers to
his People: <hi>At the Mercy-Seat, there will I answer
thee, saith the Lord,</hi> So here, in this Heaven of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47528:66"/>
Heavens, there's a Mercy-Seat, there's a Throne
of Grace, and there God will answer. <hi>We may
come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Mercy, and find Grace to help in time of Need.</hi>
Heb. 4. 16. Into this Holy of Holies none but
the High-Priest did enter, and that once a Year,
after the Sacrifice of Atonement for the whole
Congregation; then the High-Priest was to
come into the Holy of Holies, he as to pass
through the Vail with Blood, and with sweet
Incense in his hand. Just thus is Jesus entred
into the Heaven of Heavens for us; he is gone
there to present his Blood and Sufferings, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before God for us, to present himself as a
sweet-smelling Sacrifice. <hi>Heb. 9. 24. Eph.</hi> 5. 2.
Now the High-Priest, when he went with this
Blood into the Mercy-Seat, he went in with the
Names of the twelve Tribes upon his Breast
and Shoulder; and Jesus also doth appear before
God for us, representing our Persons continually
before his Father. Now about the Mercy-Seat,
there were Cherubims, and Figures of Angels;
just about the Ark, there they stooped down,
to shew, the Angels do attened about the Throne,
to dispatch Messages abroad into the World,
and convey Blessings to the Saints. There is a
Throne of Grace, a Mercy-Seat, a Mediator
there, Angels at God's Beck, ready to send up
and down, to and fro, for the good of the
Saints. And mark, not only hath Jesus this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to enter into this Heaven of Heavens;
but all the Saints have a Liberty to enter, and
that not only at Death, but in their Life time;
for saith the Apostle, <hi>Heb. 10. 19. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
boldness to enter into the Holiest, by the Blood
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47528:66"/>
of Iesus.</hi> All of us, not only when <hi>we die,</hi> and
personally go to God, do we enter into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Holies, but <hi>now</hi> we have Boldness: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth
to Prayer, for the Word signifieth Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Speech. This Holy of Holies, which was
closed and shut up against us before, is opened
by the Blood of Jesus; the Vail is rent, and
now all Saints have a Privilege to come freely
to converse with God. It is good to observe
the Difference between the Holy of Holies, and
the Heaven of Heavens: The Jews, their
<hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> was earthly; but our Holy of
Holies is heavenly. Into theirs, which was as
it were God's Bed-chamber, the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were not admitted; none but the High-Priest
could enter into the Holy of Holies: But now
into ours all Believers may enter, and converse
with God. There the High-Priest could enter
but once a Year: Now we may come to the
Throne of Grace, as often as we have a Cause
to present to God. There the High-Priest, he
entred with the Blood of Beasts; but we enter
by the Blood of the Son of God. O what a great
Privilege is this, that we have a Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!
In this respect the Holy Place is now open
to us: Tho we have not a personal Access till
Death, yet by the Blood of Jesus we may come
with Boldness, presenting our selves before the
Lord, with all our Wants and Desires. The
great Distance between Heaven and Earth shall
not hinder our Communion with God, if we
have a Friend above.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it is very comfortable now to say,
<hi>Our Father, which art in Heaven;</hi> (that is) our
gracious and reconciled Father, in and by Christ.</p>

Heavens with an Eye of Sense, with our bodily
Eyes, It is good to contemplate the Glory of
the heavenly Bodies, or the Outside of that Court
which God hath provided for the Saints. It is
not an idle Speculation I press you to: The

                     </hi>-Meditation. The Night-Meditation
you have, <hi>Psal. 8. 3. When I consider
thy Heavens, the Work of thy Fingers, the Moon
and the Stars which thou hast ordained. David</hi> was
got abroad in a Moon-shining Night, looks up,
and had his Heart affected. But now the
<hi>19th</hi> Psalm, that seems to be a <hi>Morning</hi>-Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
he speakds of the <hi>Sun coming out like a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
from his Chamber in the East,</hi> and display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Beams, and Heat, and Influences to the
World; and then saith he, <hi>v. 1. The Heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the Glory of God.</hi> Morning and Evening,
or when ever you go abroad to see the Beauty of
the outward Heavens, say, I have a Father there,
a Christ there; this is the Pavement of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
which God hath provided for the Saints.
Christians, it is a sweet Meditation, when you
can say, He that made all Things, is there. It
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47528:67"/>
will be a delightful, profitable thing, sometimes
with an Eye of Sense to take a view of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Palace, as much as we can see of it here
below.</p>
                  <p>2. Let me especially press you to this, with an
Eye of <hi>Faith</hi> to look within the Vail; and when
ever you come to pray, to see God in Heaven,
and Christ at his Right-hand. The great Work
of Faith is, to see him that is invisible; and the
great Duty of Prayer is, to get a Sight of God
in Heaven, and Christ at his right-hand. What
<hi>Stephen</hi> did miraculously, or in an Extasy, we
must do graciously in Prayer. Now it is said of
<hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7. 56. <hi>Behold, I see the Heavens
opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right-hand
of God.</hi> There is a great deal of Difference
about <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Sight: How the Heavens could be
opened; for they are solid Bodies, and cannot be
divided; fluent Air, and so come together again:
How he could see the Glory of God with his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Senses, which is invisible: How he could
see Christ at such a Distance, the Eye not being
able to reach so far. Some think it to be a meer
intellectual Vision, or a Vision of Faith; that is,
he did so firmly believe, and had the Comfort of
it in his Heart, as if he had seen it with his Eyes.
So they think <hi>Stephen</hi> saw the Glory of God, and
Christ at his right-hand, as <hi>Abraham</hi> saw Christ's
Day, and rejoiced; that is, he saw it by Faith.
Some think it to be a Prophetical Vision, by see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those things objected to his Fancy, by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Species; as <hi>Isaiah</hi> saw God in a Vision, <hi>Isa.
6.</hi> and as <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rapture. Some think it a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Vision; that he saw these thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by some corporeal Images, as <hi>Iohn</hi> saw the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47528:68"/>
Holy-Ghost descending in the form of a Dove.
Some think his bodily Eyes did pierce the Clouds,
and got a sight of the Glory of Christ. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, there must be such a Sight in Prayer,
something answerable to this; in a spiritual way
this must ever be done. <hi>Psal. 5. 3. I will pray,</hi>
saith the Psalmist, <hi>and look up.</hi> There is a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up required in all Prayer, a seeing the invisible
God by Faith. If you would have God look
down upon you from his holy Habit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion, you
must look up with an Eye of Faith, and converse
with God in Heaven. <hi>Psal. 63. 4. I will lift up my
Hands in thy Name.</hi> If you would have God look
upon you with an Eye of Compassion, you must
look up, and see Christ at his right-hand, by an
Eye of Faith.</p>
                  <p>3. Let us <hi>love</hi> our Father; love God in Christ,
and love the Place for his sake, where his Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Love God in Christ. <hi>Psal. 73. 25. Whom
have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> When God hath been
so gracious to you! Christians, if I had no
other Argument to press you to love god, but
that he which is in Heaven, offereth to be your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Christ Jesus, it might suffice; because it
is a great Condescension, that the God of Heaven
will look upon poor boken-hearted Creatures:
that he whose Throne is in Heaven, would look
upon him that is of a trembling Spirit. <hi>Isa.</hi> 66 2.
That <hi>the high and lofty One, that dwelleth in the high
and holy Place, will look to him that is of a contrite
Heart.</hi> Isa. 57. 15. That he that is the Lord of
Heaven and Earth, will be our Father, and own
us, and bless us! A great Condescension on God's
part, and a great Dignity also is put upon us;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47528:68"/>
and how should our Hearts be affected with it?
Therefore though there be a great Distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Heaven and Earth, it should not lessen our
Affections to God. He is mindful of us, visits us
at every turn, we are dear and tender to him;
therefore let the Lord be dear to you. The But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
when he was exalted, forgot <hi>Ioseph;</hi> but
Christ is not grown stately with his Advancement,
<hi>He doth not forget us;</hi> O let not us forget God.
Let us manifest our Love, by being often with him
at the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> with our Father which is
in Heaven. A Child is never well, but when in
the Mother's Lap, or under the Father's Wing:
So should it be with us, with an humble Affection
coming into the presence of God, and getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Bosom of our heavenly Father. Never
delight in any thing, so much as conversing with
him, and serious Addresses to him in Prayer.
Again,</p>
                  <p>(2.) Love the <hi>Place</hi> for his <hi>sake;</hi> God is there,
and Christ is there. We have cause to love the
Place for our <hi>own</hi> sakes; and in a short time, if
you continue patient in well-doing, you will be
with God. It is not only God's Throne, but it
is your House. 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 1. We look for an House
in Heaven, no made with hands.</hi> It is a Place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for our everlasting Abode; therefore all
our Hopes, Desires, and Delights should run that
way. But chiefly I would press you to love it
for <hi>his sake,</hi> the Place where you heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dwells. God hath not taken his Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
from Earth, which is the Place of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but from Heaven, which is the Place of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Happiness. O let us not forget our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father's House. We are to apt to say, it
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47528:69"/>
is good to be here. Christians, let us draw home
apace; let us grow more heavenly-minded every
day, seek the things which are above; prize it
rather upon this occasion, because if we were more
heavenly in the frame of our Hearts, we would be
more heavenly in our solemn Approaches to God.
What's the reason a Man is haunted with the
World, and things which are of a worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and Concern, when he comes to Prayer?
'Tis because his Heart is taken with these
Things.</p>

            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Hallowed be thy Name.</head>
               <p>WE are now come to the first petition of
the Lord's Prayer; there three Things
will fall under Discussion.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. The Order of this Petition.</item>
                  <item>II. The Necessity of putting up such a Request
to God.</item>
                  <item>III. The Sence and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aning of the Petition
it self.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I. Of the <hi>Order;</hi> it is the first of all the six.
The Petitions of the Lord's-Prayer may thus be
ranked: The four first concern the obtaining
of Good; and the two last, the removal of Evil:
either the removal of Evil <hi>past,</hi> and already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
or the removal of Evil <hi>future,</hi> and such
as may be admitted by the Temptation of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47528:70"/>
Devil. Among the former, those Things that do
more immediately concern the Glory of God, they
have the first place. In this Petition, the Glory
of God is both desired and promised on our part;
for every Prayer is both an Expression of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and also an implicit Vow, or a solemn Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
that we take upon our selves, to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
what we ask. <hi>Prayer, it is a preaching to our
selves in God's hearing.</hi> We speak to God, to
warm our selves; not for his Information, but
for our Edification.</p>
               <p>From the <hi>Order</hi> observe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That those Things are to be desired in the
first place, and with the greatest Affection, which
do concern the Glory of God: The first Petition
is, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here to shew;
<list>
                     <item>1. Why this Petition if put first.</item>
                     <item>2. Present some Reasons of the Point.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First; This Petition is put first, for a double
Reason:</p>
               <p>1. Partly, to shew that this must be the End of
all our Requests. All that we desire and pray for,
in behalf of our selves and others, must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordiante
to this End. All these things must be
asked, that by the accomplishment of them, God
may be brought more in request in the World.
See all the other Petitions in this Prayer, how
they are suited to this End in Scripture. When
we say, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> what do we beg that
for, but ultimately the Glory of God? <hi>Phil. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:47528:71"/>
10, 11. <hi>God hath given him a Name which is above
every Name, that every Tongue should confess, that
Iesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</hi>
When we say, <hi>Thy Will be done in Earth, as it is in
Heaven;</hi> it is still to the Glory of God. <hi>Mat. 5.
16. That our good Works may so shine forth before
Men here upon Earth, that they may glorify our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in Heaven,</hi> When we ask <hi>our daily
Bread,</hi> and Provisions for the present Life, it is
still that he may be glorified in our comfortable
Use of the Creature: 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 31. Whether
therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all
to the Glory of God.</hi> When we ask for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Sins, it is, <hi>that God may be glorified in
Christ:</hi> Rom. 3. 25, 26 <hi>Whom God hath set forth
to be a Propitiation, through Faith in his Blood, to
declare his Righteousness for the Remission of Sins that
are past, that he may be just,</hi> &amp;c. When we beg
<hi>Freedom from Temptation,</hi> it is that we may not
dishonour God: <hi>Prov. 30. 8, 9. Lest I be full, and
deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? Or lest I be
poor, and steal, and take the Name of my God in vain.</hi>
Still that God may be glorified in every Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
When we ask <hi>Deliverance from Evil:</hi> Psal.
50. 15. <hi>Call upon me in the Day of Trouble; I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</hi> So that the
Glory of God, in all Requests that we make to
him, like Oil, still swims on the Top, and must
be the End of all the rest; for other things are
but Means in subordination to it.</p>
               <p>2. It notes, that our chiefest Care and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should be carried out to the Glory of God,
when we pray: We should rather forget our
selves, than forget God. God must be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
in the first place. There is nothing more
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47528:71"/>
precious than God himself, therefore nothing
should be more dear to us than his Glory. This
is the great Difference between the Upright and
the Hypocrite: The Hypocrite never seeks God,
but when his Necessities do require it, not in and
for himself; But when the Upright come to seek
God, it is for God in the first place: their main
Care is about God's Concernments, rather than
their own. Tho they seek their own Happiness
in him, and they are allowed so to do; yet it is
mainly God's Glory which they seek, not their
own Interests and Concernments. See that, <hi>Psal.
115. 1. Not unto us, not unto us, O Lord, but unto
thy Name give Glory, for thy Mercy, and for thy
Truth's sake.</hi> It is not a Doxology, or Form of
Thanksgiving, but a Prayer; not for our Safety
and Welfare, so much as thy Glory: Not to
reek and satisfy our Revenge upon our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
not for the Establishment of our Interest,
but for the Glory of thy Grace and Truth, that
God may be known to be a God keeping Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
for Mercy and Truth are the two Pillars
of the Covenant. It is a great dishonouring of
God, when any thing is sought from him, more
than himself, or not for himself. Saith <hi>Austin,</hi>
it is but a carnal Affection in Prayer, when Men
seek Self more than God. <hi>Self</hi> and <hi>God</hi> are the
two things that come in competition. Now there
are several sorts of Self; there is carnal Self, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Self, spiritual Self, and glorified Self; above
all these, God must have the Preheminence.</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>Carnal Self.</hi> By a foolish Mistake we take
our Lusts to be our selves. <hi>Col. 3. 5. Mortify your
Members here upon Earth:</hi> And these Members he
makes to be Fornication, Uncleanness, and the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47528:72"/>
like. Our Sins are as dear to us, as any essential
or integral part of the Body; they are our Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
Now these should have no room in our
Prayers at all, tho usually they have the first place.
Jam. 4. 3. <hi>Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask
amiss, that ye may consume it upon your Lusts.</hi> Our
Prayers should be the Breathings of the Spirit,
and usually they are but the Belches and Eruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the Flesh. And for these it is we are
so instant and earnest with God. We would
have God bless us in some revengeful and carnal
Enterprize. We deal with God, as the Thief
that lighted his Candle at the Lamps of the Altar:
So many would make God a Party in their carnal
Designs. <hi>Prov. 21. 27. The Sacrifice of the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
is an Abomination; how much more, when he
bringeth it with a wicked Mind?</hi> It is an Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
when it is at the best; but when he hath
an ill Aim, then it is an Abomination with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Foolish Creatures vainly imagine to entice
Heaven to their Lure. <hi>Balaam</hi> buildeth Altars,
and sacrificed, out of hope that God would curse
his own People, and engage in <hi>Moab's</hi> Quarrel;
like the Man in the Gospel, that would make no
other use of Christ, than to compose his civil
Difference: <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 13. he comes to him as a
Man of Authority, <hi>Master, speak to my Brother,
that he divide the Inheritance with me.</hi> We all look
upon God, <hi>tanquam aliquem magnum,</hi> (as <hi>Austin</hi>
said he did in his Infancy) as some great Power,
that would serve all our carnal Turns. In this
Sence, <hi>we make God to serve our Sins,</hi> Isa. 43. 24.
when we would have God to contribute to our
Lusts; to our Pride, Wantonness, Revenge.
This is such a foolish Request, as if a Wife should
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47528:72"/>
beg of her Husband, to give her leave to go on
with her Adulteries. Survey all the Petitions
which are in this present Platform of Prayer,
there is not one that is calculated for such an evil
purpose, as our Revenge, Pomp, Pride, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Carnal Self surely must give way to God.</p>
               <p>(2.) There's a natural Self, when we seek our
own Temporal Felicity. Christ hath allowed
these natural Desires a Room in our Prayers;
but they must keep their Order, and their Place:
first, God's Glory; and then, our Safety. The
obtaining of natural Good is put in the last place.
And therefore when our Thoughts only run upon
Temporal Felicity, and outward Supplies, it is
not Prayer, but a brutish Cry: <hi>Hos. 7. 14. They
howl upon their Beds for Corn, Wine and Oil.</hi> Beasts
are sensible of their Pain, and are carried by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Instinct to seek their own Welfare, as well
as Men. And therefore when this is our first and
only Request, it is a Perversion of that Order,
which Christ hath set down in this perfect Form
of Prayer.</p>
               <p>(3.) There is <hi>Spiritual Self:</hi> Which is valuable,
either in point of Justification, or Acceptance
with God; or in point of Sanctification, and
Conformity to him. Now as these Blessings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be severed from God's Glory, where they
are really enjoyed; so they must not be severed
in our Prayers, nor preferred before it. To ask
Pardon as a separate Benefit, as it concerns our
Ease and Quiet, not as it concerns God's Glory,
is a Perversion and a Diversion of our Prayers.
The main thing, which God intends should be
the main thing in our Requests, is, the <hi>Praise of
his glorious Grace, wherein he hath made us accepted
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47528:73"/>
in the Beloved.</hi> Eph. 1. 6. And therefore this is
the main thing which the Soul intends: <hi>Psal. 79. 9.
Help us, O God of our Salvation, for the Glory of
thy Name; and deliver us, and purge away our Sins,
for thy Names sake.</hi> The Argument is not taken
from <hi>themselves</hi> meerly, or from their own <hi>Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
but from God's <hi>Glory.</hi> If God could not be
more glorified in our Pardon, and Acceptance
with him, than in our Death and Damnation, it
were an evil thing to desire Pardon. But now
when God hath abundantly cleared up this to us,
he is no Loser by Acts of Mercy; that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
more to the exalting of his great Name,
to accept poor Sinners to Mercy: the Soul goeth
with the more confidence to beg it of God, that
he would purge us from our Filthiness for his
Names sake. But now Mens Thoughts are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken up with their own Peace and Safety, and
take no care for God's Honour; this is but a
Selfish Request, or an Offer of Nature after Ease.
For the other part, to ask for Grace, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to God's Will, meerly as it is a Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Nature, abstractly from <hi>God's Glory;</hi>
it is not a right Request: It is contrary to the
very Nature of Grace, whose Tendency is to
God in the first place, that his Name may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
that we should be to the praise of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Grace. Grace wrought in us, is but a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and not to be preferred before the Creator.
See how the Apostle prays, 2 <hi>Thess. 1. 11, 12. We
pray always for you, that our God would count you
worthy of this Calling, and fulfill all the good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his Goodness, and the Work of Faith with
Power: That the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ
may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47528:73"/>
the Grace of our God, and the Lord Iesus Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
That is a regular Prayer, when all our spiritual
Interests are swallowed up in <hi>God,</hi> and we beg
that his Name may be glorified in us, and upon
us.</p>
               <p>(4.) There is <hi>glorified</hi> Self, which standeth in
the eternal Fruition of God. Man was made for
two Ends; to glorify God, and to enjoy him.
Now our Crown of Glory must be laid at God's
Feet; as the Elders, <hi>Rev. 4. 10. Saying, Thou art
worthy, O Lord, to receive Glory, and Honour, and
Power.</hi> All our Desires must give place to this,
that he may be glorified in our eternal Happiness;
and we are to beg it no farther, than as it may
stand with his Honour. Mans chief End, and so
his chief Request in respect of himself, is, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
God; but with respect to God, so it is the
highest only of subordinate Ends; for the highest
chiefly and absolutely, is the glorifying of God.</p>
               <p>Well then, therefore this is put first, to shew,
that our chiefest Care and Affection should mainly
run upon the Glory of God, and that God might
be advanced, and lifted up on high.</p>
               <p>Secondly; To give you some Reasons, why
those things which concern the <hi>Glory of God</hi> must
be sought in the first place, and with the greatest
Affection.</p>
               <p>1. As we are <hi>reasonable</hi> Creatures, it is fit it
should be so. In all regular Desires, the <hi>End</hi> is
first intended, and then the <hi>Means.</hi> But now
the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> that is the <hi>End</hi> of all things:
Prov. 16. 4. <hi>The Lord hath made all Things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi>
that is, <hi>for his own Glory,</hi> for the manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Excellency. And so our <hi>Redemption,</hi>
Luke 2. 14. <hi>Glory be to God on high.</hi> When God
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47528:74"/>
came to shew his Good-Will in Christ, it was to
make way for his Glory: As it begins in Good-Will,
so it must end in Glory. This is the end
of all the Privileges we have by Nature and Grace.
Now God's Glory is the end of our Being and
Service, and therefore must be first taken care of
in our Prayers; first his Glory, and then our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
for the End is the first thing intended by any
rational Agent.</p>
               <p>2. As we are the <hi>Children</hi> of God by <hi>Adoption:</hi>
The great Duty of Children is to honour their
Parents. God pleads for Honour upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
Mal. 1. 6. <hi>If I be a Father, where is my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</hi>
So that if you consent to the Preface, and
say, <hi>Our Father;</hi> then the next request will be,
<hi>Hallowed be thy Name.</hi> If we would own our
selves in such a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lation, then we must make it
our chief desire and care, that God might be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by our selves and others. Every kind of
Honour will not serve the turn of our Heavenly
Father. He must not be honoured as an ordinary
Father, in a common Notion, but as an In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inite
and Eternal Majesty; and to prefer any thing to
his Interest or Glory, or to equal any thing to
him, it is to make an Idol of him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
him to be our Father. The case of earthly
Parents is not always so. But now you renounce
God, when an Idol is set in the Throne; when
any Interest or Concernment of yours is preferred
before God, and before his Interest and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>3. That which is of most value and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should be sought first. Now God's Glory, it
hath an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inite Excellency above all other things.
The Glory of God is of more worth than all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47528:74"/>
than their Being and Happiness. The End
is more worthy than that which serveth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
to the End. Meats and Drinks, they were
made for the Body, therefore are not so good as
the Body. Who would dig for Iron with Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks
of Gold? The Means or Instrument is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
worth than the Purchase. Now no matter
what becomes of us, so God may be glorifyed.
As it is said of <hi>David, Thou art better than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of us;</hi> therefore, tho they exposed their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to hazard, they thought it not safe for him:
So is God better than the whole World of Men or
Angels. Our first care must be that he may be
glorifyed, then let other Things succeed in their
place.</p>
               <p>4. The Example of Christ, shews how much
the Glory of God should be cared for, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before the Creatures Good; Joh. 12. 27, 28.
<hi>Father, save me from this hour:</hi> There was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
and sinless Inclination of his Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But, <hi>For this Cause came I unto this Hour;
Father glorify thy Name.</hi> He doth not so earnestly
insist upon that, but submits all his Human Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
tho exceeding precious, that they
might give way to the Glory of God; and he had
no respect to his own Ease, or to the innocent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of his Human Nature, or to the felt
Comforts of the God-head. Now Christ's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
it is the best Instruction: he taught us how
we should behave our selves to our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and therefore, we should learn to prefer
the Honour of God, before our own ease: And
if God but get up, tho we be kept low and poor,
yet we should be contented. Look, as all natural
Things will act against their particular Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47528:75"/>
on for a general Good; as to avoid a Vacuity,
the Air will descend, and the Water ascend, that
there may not be a Confusion or Dissolution of
the Frame of Nature: So hath Christ taught us
still to prefer a general Good. <hi>Father, glorify thy
self;</hi> that is it we must insist upon, tho it be with
our Loss, Suffering, Trouble, yea, sometimes
with our trouble of Conscience, we must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p>5. From the Nature of <hi>Prayer.</hi> The whole
Spiritual Life it is a living to God. Gal. 2. 19. <hi>I
am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God.</hi> The
whole Tendency and Ordination of all acts of the
Spiritual Life, they are to God. Even the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
Life is over-ruled and directed to this End;
there is an Eating and Drinking to <hi>God;</hi> the
Meat and Drink we take, if God be not the last
End of it, it is but a Meat-Offering, and a Drink-Offering
to our own Appetite, and a Sacrifice to
<hi>Moloch:</hi> Now much more in acts of immediate
Worship, there God will be principally regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for their respect and tendency is mainly to
God. In our whole Life we are God's, dedicated
to him. Every Godly Man is set apart for God.
A Man that is a Christian, must <hi>Be holy in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Conversation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 15. A Christian must
look upon himself, as one that is dedicated to
God, when he is at his Meals, in his Trade and
Calling; and Grace is to run out in every Act.
But much more is this tendency of Grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
it self in our solemn Sequestration of our
selves, when we make our nearer approaches to
him. Lev. 10. 3. <hi>I will be sanctified in them that
come nigh me, and before all the People will I be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
What is it to sanctify God? A thing is san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47528:75"/>
when it is set apart: And God is sanctified,
when we set apart our selves wholly for him, when
he hath more than common Affections, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Respects. And therefore in Prayer, in the
first<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> place we should go to God, for God,
and surely in such a Request we are likely to
speed.</p>
               <p>6. Love to God (if it be unfeigned, and hath
any Strength in the Soul) will necessarily put us
upon this. Love seeks the good of the Party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
as much or more than its own. Those
which love, have all things in common between
them; and one counts it done to himself what is
done to the other: So it is in the Love between
us and God. Look, as Christ loves the Saints,
and counteth what ever you do to them it is done
to him, because done to those whom he loved,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. So reciprocally, the Saint which loves
God, what is done to God is done to us; when
God is honoured, we are comforted as much or
more than with our own Benefit: And when God
is dishonoured, we have the Grief and Sorrow.
Psal. 69. 9. <hi>The Reproaches of them that reproached
thee, are fallen upon me.</hi> Or if they hear God's
Name rent in pieces, and Men dishonour him by
their filthy Lives, it goeth to their Hearts; for
God and they have but one common Interest:
Nay, they prefer God's Interest before their own,
or any others; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. 15. Simon, <hi>Son of</hi> Jonas,
<hi>lovest thou me more than these?</hi> By the Worlds
Maxim, Love should begin at home; but by
Christ's Direction, it beginneth with God: They
are more tender of God's Glory, than their own
Lives, and outward Comfort. <hi>I count not my Life
dear to me,</hi> saith <hi>Paul.</hi> Thus you see, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47528:76"/>
there is why our main Care and Thoughts
should be taken up about the Concernments of
God, and about the Glory of his Holy Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. To reprove us, that we are no more
affected with God's Glory, O how little do we
aim at and regard it in our Prayers? We should
seek it, not only above the Profits and Pleasures of
this Life, but even above Life it self; yea, above
Life present and to come. But alas! since the
Fall we are corrupt, and wholly poisoned with
Self-Love, we prefer every base Interest and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
before God; nay, we prefer carnal Self before
God. Some are wholly brutish, and so they may
wallow in Ease and Pleasure, and eat the Fat, and
drink the Sweet, never think of God, care not
how God is dishonoured, both by themselves and
others. And then some, O how tender are they
in matters of their own Concernment, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with it, more than for the Glory of God!
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 43. They are more affected with their
own Honour, and their own Loss and Reproach,
than with God's dishonour, or God's Glory. If
their own Reputation be but hazarded a little, O
how it stings them to the Heart! But if they be
faulty towards God, they can pass it over without
Trouble. A Word of Disgrace, a little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
cast upon our Persons, kindles the Coals,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ills us with Rage; but we can hear God's
Name dishonoured, and not be moved with it.
When they pray, if they beg outward Blessings,
if they ask any thing, it is for their Lusts, not for
God; 'tis but to feed their Pomp and Excess, and
that they may shine in the Pomp and Splendor of
external Accommodations. If they beg Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47528:76"/>
and Enlargment, it is for their own Honour;
that their Lusts may be fed by the Contributions
of Heaven: So by a wicked Design, they would
even make God to serve the Devil. The best of
us, when we come to pray, what a deep Sense
have we of our own Wants, and no desire of the
Glory of God. If we beg daily Bread, Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and Protection; we do not beg it as a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to be improved for our Master's use, but as
Fuel for our Lusts. If we beg Deliverance, it is
because we are in pain, and ill at ease; not that
we may Honour and glorify God, that Mercy and
Truth may shine forth. If we beg Pardon; it is
only to get rid of the Smart, and enlarged out of
the Stocks of Conscience. If they beg Grace; it
is but a lazy Wish after Sanctification, because they
are convinced there is no other way to be happy.
If they beg eternal Glory; they do not beg it for
God, it appears plainly, because they can be
content to dishonour God long, provided they at
length may be saved. Most of us pray without a
Heart set to glorify God, and to bring Honour
unto his great Name. Tho a Man hath never so
much sense and feeling in his Prayer, yet if his
H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>art be not duly set as to the Glory of God,
his Prayer is turned into Sin. It is not the
manner of the Vehemency only, for a Carnal
Spring may send forth High-Tides of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
and Motions that come from Lust, may
be earnest and very rapid: Therefore it is not
enough to have Fervour and Vehemency, but
when our aim is to honour and glorify God:
Zech. 7. 5, 6. <hi>When ye fasted, did ye at all fast unto
me, even to me? And when ye did eat, and when ye
did drink, did you not eat for your selves, and drink
for your selves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:47528:77"/>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. For Exhortation, to press us to seek
the Glory of God above all things. Take these
Arguments.</p>
               <p>1. How necessary it is the Lord should have his
Glory. The World serves for no other purpose,
it is made and continued for this End; Rev. 4. 11.
<hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive Glory, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and Power: For thou hast created all things, and
for thy Pleasure they are and were created.</hi> All that
God hath made, it was for his own Glory. And
Rom. 11. 36. <hi>For of him, and through him, and to
him are all things: To whom be Glory for ever. Amen.
Of him,</hi> in a way of Creation; <hi>Through him,</hi> by
way of Providential Influence and Supportation;
that they may be <hi>To him,</hi> in their final tendency
and result. God did not make us for our selves,
but his own Glory.</p>
               <p>2. It is a singular Benefit to be admitted to
sanctify God's Name. O that poor Worms should
come and put the Crown upon God's Head! And
that he will count any thing we can do to be a
Glory to himself; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Chron. 29. 14. <hi>But who am I,
and what is my People, that we should be able to offer
so willingly after this sort? For all things come of thee,
and of thine own have we given thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Consider how much it concerneth us; that we
may make some Restitution for our former disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of God, therefore we should be more
zealous in this Work. How forward have we
been to dishonour God in Thought, Word, and
Deed, before the Lord wrought upon us? There
is not a Mercy but we have abused it, nor any
thing we have medled with, but one way or other
we have turned it to the Lord's Reproach and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47528:77"/>
Dishonour. Now when the Lord hath put Grace
in our Hearts, <hi>When we are a People formed for his
Praise.</hi> Isa. 43. When he hath made us anew, we
should think of making some Restitution, some
amends to God, and should zealously affect his
Glory above all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. For Trial. Do we prefer the Glory of
God in the first place? Take these Marks.</p>
               <p>1. Then we would be content with our own
loss, provided the Name of God may gain any
respect in the World; and so he may be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
no matter what becomes of us, and our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and Concernment. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20. The Apostle
expresseth there a kind of Indifferency; <hi>So Christ
shall be magnified in my Body, whether it be by Life or
by Death.</hi> O then it is a sign you make it your
purpose, drift, and care, when you are contented
to do or be any thing that God will have you to
be or do. This holds good, not only in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Concernments, when you are content to want
necessary Food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it holds also in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Concernments: As to sense of Pardon; tho
God should suspend the Consolations of his Spirit,
yet if it be for the Glory of his Grace, I am to be
content: Nay, in some Cases God's Glory is more
to be cared for than our own Salvation, if they
two could come in competition; but that case ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
falls out with the Creature; our Salvation is
conjoyned with the Glory of God. But yet in
supposition, if it should, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> puts the
Supposition, Exod. 32. 32. <hi>Blot me, I pray thee out
of the Book which thou hast written:</hi> So God might
be honoured in saving that People. So Rom. 9. 3.
<hi>For I could wish that my self wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> accursed from Christ,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47528:78"/>
for my Brethren, my Kinsmen according to the Flesh.</hi>
It was not a rash Speech, a thing spoken out of
an unadvised Passion; see but with what a serious
Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ace it is ushered in, vers. 1. <hi>God is my Witness
I lye not, my Conscience also bearing me witness in the
Holy Ghost:</hi> He calls God to witness, this was the
real disposition of his Heart, and he speaks advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly,
and with good deliberation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But is it lawful thus to wish to be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?
Certainly <hi>Paul</hi> could not wish himself to
love Christ less, or to be less beloved of him; for
these things we cannot part with them without
Sin: but in our enjoyment of Christ there is a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
part, some personal Happiness which resulteth
to us; now all this he could lay at God's Feet.
How so? What for others? A regular Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
at home, and every Man is bound to look to
his own Salvation first, and then the Salvation of
others. But that was not the case, it was not
their Salvation, and <hi>Paul</hi>'s Salvation, which was in
Competition; but the Glory of God, and the
common Salvation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>'s parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Salvation. It was a mighty prejudice to the
Gospel, that the People from whom Christ's Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
proceeded, (for the Law went out of <hi>Sion,</hi>
the Gospel came out from among the <hi>Iews,</hi>) that
so many of them were prejudiced, and a mighty
Eclipse to the Glory of God. Now he could lay
down all his personal Happiness at God's Feet, he
speaks in Supposition, if such a Case falls out.
But however this is a clear Rule, the Glory of
God must be preferred before our own Salvation.
In some Cases there will be need of this Rule. For
Instance, there's many a Man that possibly is
convinced of a false Religion; and the first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47528:78"/>
Men make is, if they can be saved in such a
Religion, but many Men are hardned in Popery.
When therefore a Man is contented to continue
in a false Religion, and dishonour God with his
complyance there, provided he may be saved;
he prefers his own Salvation before the Glory of
God. And in case of the delay of Repentance,
when Men dally with God, and put off the work
of returning to the Lord until another time, or
hereafter it is time enough to repent; these Men
prize their Salvation before the Glory of God: If
it were true upon that Supposition, that if ever
they shall be saved, they are contented God shall
be dishonoured a great deal longer, and that if
they be saved at length, this will satisfy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how may we discern that we make
the Glory of God the first and chief thing we aim
at in Prayer?</p>
               <p>1. Partly by the work of your own Thoughts.
The End is first in Intention, tho last in Execution.
When you are praying for a publick Mercy against
an Enemy, what runs in your Thoughts? Revenge,
Safety, and your own personal Happiness, or
God's Glory? <hi>What wilt thou do, O Lord, unto thy
great Name?</hi> Josh. 7. 9. Are you pleasing your
selves, with Suppositions of your Escape and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
and reeking your Wrath upon your
Adversaries? So in Prayer for Strength and
Quickning, what is it that runs in your Mind?
Are you entertaining your Spirit with Dreams of
Applause, and feeding your Minds with the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of popular Acclamation?</p>
               <p>2. By the manner of praying, absolutely for
God's Glory, but for all other things with a sweet
Submission to God's Will. Joh. 12. 27. <hi>Father, save
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47528:79"/>
me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this
hour. Father, glorify thy Name. Then came there
a Voice from Heaven, saying, I have both glorified it,
and will glorify it again.</hi> Christ is absolute in the
Request, and he receives an Answer. Is this
enough? Do you mainly press God with this, that
he might provide for his own glorious Name, that
his Name might not lye under Reproach? But
now carnal Aims do make Affection impetuous and
impatient of check and denial. <hi>Rachel</hi> must have
Children, or dye. When the Heart is set upon
earthly Success, Pleasure, or Comfort, then they
cannot brook a denial without Murmuring. The
Children of God only accept of God's Glory, and
in all other things they leave themselves to God's
disposal, and therefore this is the main thing.</p>
               <p>3. Partly too by the Disposition of your Hearts
when your Prayers are accomplished, and God
hath given any Blessing you pray for; we do not
ask it for God's Glory, if we do not use it for
God's Glory. The time of having Mercies is the
time of Trial, and therefore when we <hi>consume our
Mercies upon our Lusts,</hi> when they do not conduce
to check our Sins, it is a sign God's Glory is not
the thing intended, as it should be.</p>
               <p>Thus for the Order of this Petition.</p>
               <p>II. The Necessity of putting up such a Request
to God. 'Tis his charge to us in the Third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
That we should sanctify his Name;
<hi>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in
vain:</hi> The positive part of that Commandment,
is, Thou shalt <hi>sanctify it.</hi> Now here we make it
matter of Prayer to God; <hi>Hallowed be thy Name.</hi>
From whence let me observe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:47528:79"/>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> Those that would have God's Name Hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Glorified, must seriously deal with God
about it.</p>
               <p>There are several Reasons why we must put up
such Requests to God. I might argue from the
Utility, and the Necessity of it.</p>
               <p>First, the Utility: We put up these Requests
to God.</p>
               <p>1. That we may more solemnly warn our selves
of our own Duty. In Prayer there is an implicit
Vow, or solemn Obligation, that we take upon
our selves, to prosecute what we ask; <hi>It is a
Preaching to our selves in God's hearing.</hi> So that
every Word we speak to God, is a Lesson to us,
and our Requests are as so many Exhortations to
glorify his Holy Name: With what Face can we
ask that which we are wholly wretchless and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectful
of. Then we shall certainly come under
that Character, Mat. 15. 7, 8. <hi>This People draweth
nigh unto me with their Mouth, and honoureth me with
their Lips: but their Heart is far from me.</hi> It is
the greatest Mockage of God to ask, unless we
have a Mind to pursue, and diligently to attend
to this Work and Business, that the Name of God
may be glorified in us, and upon us.</p>
               <p>2. That we may have a due Sense and Grief for
God's Honour. God's Children, they are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to see God dishonoured. <hi>Lot</hi>'s righteous
Soul was vexed, not with <hi>Sodom</hi>'s Injuries, but
with <hi>Sodom</hi>'s Sins. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8. And <hi>David</hi> saith,
<hi>Rivers of Tears run down mine Eyes, because Men
keep not thy Law,</hi> Psal. 119. 136. Many will scarce
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47528:80"/>
weep for their own Sins, where they have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of remorse of Conscience; but when they are
zealously affected with God's Glory, they will
weep for others Sins: When his Name is torn
and rent in pieces, it is a grief of Heart to them.
Now God will have us ask this, that this Holy
Sense of Spiritual Grief may be kept up; for when
it is become the matter of our Requests, then we
are interested in the Glory of God. We are loth
to see things miscarry, where we have petitioned
and begged for others; so when we have begged
the Glory of his Name, it will further this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Sense and Grief of Heart, when his Name is
dishonoured.</p>
               <p>3. That we may count it as great a Blessing
when God is glorified, as when we are saved.
<hi>Continue in Prayer,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>and watch
thereunto with Thanksgiving.</hi> When we have been
instant with God in Prayer, that he might be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
then we shall count it as great a Blessing
when he is glorified, as when we are saved. Prayer
makes way for the increase of our Esteem, and
engages us to observe the return. When we have
asked it of God, we will be affected with it then.
When we see all his Works praise him, what a
Comfort will this be to the Soul. <hi>Bless the Lord,
O my Soul,</hi> Psal. 103. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Secondly, Let me shew the Necessity of
dealing with God about it. The Necessity will
appear, both in respect of Persons, and Things;
when we beg that God's Name may be Hallowed,
we beg Dispositions of Heart, and Occasions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:47528:80"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Necessity will appear in respect of
<hi>Persons;</hi> both as to our Selves, and Others.</p>
               <p>First, In respect of our <hi>Selves.</hi> There is a great
Necessity that we should deal with God about the
Hallowing of his Name; because we need Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Quickning, Sincerity, Submission to God,
Humility, and Holiness.</p>
               <p>To instance in these six Things.</p>
               <p>1. We need <hi>Direction.</hi> The Habits of Grace
are God's Gifts, and the Exercise of Grace is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing; to actuate, quicken, guide, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
it, 2 Thess. 3. 5. <hi>The Lord direct your Hearts
to the love of God.</hi> And so in Prayer, and in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of God. In <hi>Prayer, We know not</hi> how, or
<hi>what to pray for as we ought.</hi> Tho we have Grace,
yet we need Direction. A Ship that is well rigg'd,
yet needs a skilful Pilot. Rom. 8. 26. <hi>Likewise the
Spirit also helpeth our Infirmities: for we know not
what we should pray for as we ought.</hi> How much are
we to seek, to give God his due Honour? <hi>Of our
selves we cannot so much as think a good Thought,</hi>
2 Cor. 3. 5. There is an utter insufficiency in us
to meditate of God, and conceive aright of his
Excellency, and give him the Honour which is
due to him. None of us but needs daily to go to
God, that we may be taught how to hallow and
sanctify his Name.</p>
               <p>2. We need <hi>Quickning,</hi> being so backward to
this Duty. All the Lepers could beg Help, and
but one returned to give God the Glory. There
is much dulness and deadness of Heart, as to the
praising of God, and glorifying of God. Self-Love
will put us upon other Things; but it is
Grace must quicken us to glorify him, and praise
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47528:81"/>
him. When we go to God for our selves, our
Necessities will sharpen our Affections, and put a
shrill Accent upon our Prayers: But now when
we beg of God, for God, then there is a greater
Restraint upon us. And therefore <hi>David</hi> saith,
Psal. 51. 15. <hi>Open thou my Lips, and my Mouth shall
shew forth thy Praise.</hi> We need God to open our
Mouths, (that is) enlarge our Hearts, and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
our Affections. How apt are we to turn the
back upon the Mercy-Seat? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. 9. If a
Man came in at the North Gate, he was to go
out at the South Gate, but never at the same
Door; why? That he might not turn his Back
upon the Mercy-Seat. When we have prayed,
we are apt to forget that God which hath blessed
as; and therefore that our Hearts might be inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and quickned, we need to go to God.</p>
               <p>3. We need <hi>Vprightness</hi> and Sincerity, that we
may mind the Glory of God. This is not a Work
of Nature, but Grace. <hi>Phil. 2. 21. All Men seek
their own, not the Things which are Iesus Christ's.</hi>
There is the Fruit and Effect of Nature, it puts
Men upon seeking their own Things, worldly
Ease, Profit, and Pleasure; every Creature na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
seeks its own Welfare: But to make the
<hi>Glory of God</hi> our great Aim and Pursuit, it is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e puts upon that. Water ascends no higher
than it descends; so Nature cannot rise beyond
it self. The Stream cannot rise above the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ain,
and above the Principle. A Man that hath
nothing but Nature, he cannot unfeignedly seek
the Things which are of God. The Old-Man,
with the deceitful Lusts, that's the natural Man:
The upright Heart, that unfeignedly seeks God,
needs Grace from above. Without Influence from
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47528:81"/>
God, our Actions cannot have a tendency to
God. We shall prefer our Interest before God's
Glory, if we have no higher Principle than what
our Hearts could furnish us with.</p>
               <p>4. We must go to God for <hi>Submission.</hi> Now
there is a double Submission required, which if we
have not, we shall find it marvellously difficult to
glorify God: One, as to the choice of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
another, as to the Way and Means, by
which God will bring about his own Glory.</p>
               <p>(1.) As to the Choice of <hi>Instruments.</hi> There
is in us an Envy, and wicked Emulation. O how
hard a matter is it, to rejoice in the Gifts, and
Graces, and Services of others, and be content
with the Dispensation, when God will cast us by,
as unworthy, and use others for the glorifying
of his Name! Therefore that we may refer the
Choice of Instruments to God, we need go to
him, and say, Lord, <hi>hallowed be thy Name;</hi> do it
which way, and by whom thou pleasest. We
are troubled, if others glorify God, and not we,
or more than we; if they be more holy, more
useful, or more serious, Self will not yield to this.
Now by putting up this Prayer to God, we refer
it to him, to chuse the Instrument whom he will
employ. It was a commendable Modesty and
Self-denial in <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> which is described,
John 3. 13. <hi>He must increase, I must decrease.</hi>
When we are contented to be abased and obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
provided Christ may be honoured and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and be content with such a Dispensation,
tho with our Loss and Decrease. Many are of a
private Station, and straitned in Gifts, and can
have no publick Instrumentality for God; now
these need to pray, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47528:82"/>
they may rejoyce when God useth others, whom
he hath furnished with greater Abilities.</p>
               <p>(2.) A Submission for the <hi>Way;</hi> that we may
submit to those unpleasing Means, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of his Providence, that God will take up,
and make use of, for the glorifying of his holy
Name. Many times we must be content, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be active Instruments, but passive Objects of
<hi>God's Glory:</hi> And therefore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>God</hi> will glorify
himself by our Poverty, or our Disgrace, our
Pain and Sickness, we must be content. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we need to deal with God seriously about
this Matter, that we may submit to the Lord's
Will, as Jesus Christ did, <hi>Iohn 12. 27, 28. Save
me from this Hour; but for this cause came I unto
this Hour: Father, glorify thy Name. And there
was a Voice from Heaven, that said, I have glorified
it, and will glorify it again.</hi> Put me to Shame, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
to endure the Cross, the Curse, so thou
mayest be glori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ied. This was the humble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Christ Jesus, and such a Submission
should be in us. The Martyrs were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ntented to

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> bound to the Stake, if that way God will use
them to his glory. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20. saith <hi>Paul, So Christ
shall be magnified in my Body, whether it be by Life,
or by Death:</hi> If my Body be taken to Heaven in
glory, or whether it be exercised or worn out
with Ministerial Labour. We need to deal with
God, that we may have the End, and leave the
Means to his own chusing; that God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in our Condition, whatever it be. If he
will have us rich and full, that he might be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in our Bounty; if he will have us poor and
low, that he may be glorified in our Patience; if
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e will have us healthy, that he may be glorified
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47528:82"/>
in our Labour; if he will have us sick, that he
may be glorified in our Pain; if he will have us
live, that he may be glorified in our Lives; if he
will have us die, that he may be glorified in our
Deaths: And therefore, <hi>Whether we live or die,
we are the Lord's.</hi> Rom. 14. 9. A Christian is to
be like a Dye in the hand of Providence, content
whether he be cast high or low; and not to grudg
at it, whether he will continue us longer, or take
us out of the World. As a Servant employed
beyond the Seas, if his Master will have him tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
there he tarries; if he would have him come
home, home he comes. So that we had need to
deal seriously with God about this submissive
Spirit.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Humility;</hi> that we may not put the Crown
upon our own Heads, but may cast it at the
Lamb's feet; that we may not take the <hi>Glory of
our Graces</hi> to our selves. God's great Aim in the
Covenant is, <hi>That no Flesh should glory in it self:
but whosoever glories, may glory in the Lord.</hi> 1 Cor.
1. 27,-31. He would have us still come and
own him, in all that we are, and in all that we
do. As the good Servant gave account of his
Diligence, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 16. he doth not say, <hi>My In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,</hi>
but, <hi>Thy Pound hath gained ten Pounds.</hi>
And <hi>Paul</hi> was a zealous Instrument, that went
up and down doing good; he <hi>laboured more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
than they all: Yet not I, but the Grace of
God, which was with me.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. In this
Case, if we would honour and glorify God, we
must do as <hi>Ioab</hi> did, when he was likely to take
<hi>Rabbah:</hi> He sent for <hi>David,</hi> to gather up more
Forces, and encamp against the City, and take it,
<hi>Lest I take the City, and it be called after my Name.</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:47528:83"/>
2 Sam. 12. 28. How careful was he that his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
might have the Honour? So careful
should we be, that the Crown be set upon Christ's
Head, and that he may have the glory of our
Graces and Services, that they may not be called
after our own Name, that God may be more
owned in them than we. Now what more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
than for Creatures to intercept the Revenues
of the Crown of Heaven, and to convert them
to their own Use? It is a vile Sacriledg, to rob
God of the <hi>Glory</hi> of that <hi>Grace</hi> he hath bestowed
upon us; and yet what more common? The
Flesh is apt to interpose upon all occasions; and
therefore we need to put up this Request, <hi>Hallowed
be thy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. There is <hi>Holiness</hi> required, that we may not
be a Disgrace to God, and a Dishonour to him.
The Lord saith, <hi>Ezek. 20. 9. That his Name should
not be polluted before the Heathen, among whom they</hi>
(his People) <hi>were.</hi> The Sin of God's People
doth stain the Honour of God, and profane his
Name. When Men profess much, to be a People
near God, and live carnally and loosly, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
God exceedingly by their Conversation.
Men judg by what is visible and sensible, and so
they think of God, by his Servants and Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
as the Heathens did of Christ in <hi>Salvian</hi>'s
time, <hi>If he was a holy Christ, certainly Christians
would live more temperately, justly, and soberly.</hi>
They are apt to think of God by his Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and by the People that profess themselves
so near and dear to him; therefore it concerns
us to walk so, that our Lives may honour him.
Mat. 5. 16. <hi>Let your Light so shine before Men,
that they may see your good Works, and glorify your
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47528:83"/>
Father which is in Heaven.</hi> As the <hi>Loins of the
Poor</hi> (saith <hi>Iob) blessed him,</hi> Job 31. 20. name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as they were fed and cloathed by his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
So our Lives may glorify God. <hi>David</hi> saith,
Psal. 119. 7. <hi>Then shall I praise thee with Vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Heart, when I have learned thy righteous
Iudgment.</hi> There is no way to praise God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
and sincerely, until we have learned both
to <hi>know and do his Will.</hi> Real Praise is the
Praise God looks after. Otherwise we do
but serve Christ, as the Devil served him, who
would carry him upon the Top of the Mountain,
but it was with an intent to bid him throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
down again: So we seem to exalt God
much in our Talk and Profession; yea, but we
throw him down, when we pollute him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him in our Conversation. Our Lives are the
Scandal of Religion, and a Pollution and Blot to
the Name of God. So that with respect to our
selves, you see what need we have to go to God,
that he will give us Grace that we may please
him, and glorify his Name.</p>
               <p>Secondly; In regard of <hi>Others.</hi> A Christian
cannot be content to glorify God himself, but he
would have all about him to glorify God. As
Fire turns all Things round about it into Fire;
and Leaven, it spreads still, until it hath subdued
the whole Lump: So is Grace a diffusive, a
spreading thing. As far as we can reach and diffuse
our Influence, we would have God brought into
request with all round about us. <hi>Being converted,</hi>
saith Christ to <hi>Peter, strengthen thy Brethren?</hi> So
it will be, where there is true Grace. Mules, and
Creatures which are of a Mongril and Bastard-Race,
they beget not after their kind: So Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard-Christians
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47528:84"/>
are not for the calling in of others,
and the gaining of those about them. But a true
Christian will be earnest, and much in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Now their Hearts are not in our Power, but
in God's; therefore we need to be much in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and make this our main Request, Lord, <hi>hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
be thy Name.</hi> For hereby,</p>
               <p>1. We acknowledg God's Dominion over the
Spirits of Men, which is a great Honour to God,
and a quieting to us. It is a Title often given to
God in Scripture, that he is the <hi>God of the Spirits
of all Flesh.</hi> If they had a Magistrate to chuse,
they go to God: <hi>Numb. 27. 16. Let the Lord,
the God of the Spirits of all Flesh, set a Man over
the Congregation.</hi> If a Judgment to be averted,
Numb. 16. 22. <hi>O God, the God of the Spirits of all
Flesh, shall one Man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with
all the Congregation?</hi> This is a great Honour to
God, when we acknowledg the Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
that he hath over the Hearts and Spirits of
Men. To roll a Stone, is not so much as to
rule the Creatures; and to keep the Sun in his
Course, is not so much as to rule the Spirits of
Men, and to work them to the glorifying of his
holy Name. God can turn the Hearts of Men
this way, and that way, according as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.
Prov. 21. 1. <hi>The King's Heart is in the hand
of the Lord, as the Rivers of Water, he turneth it
whithersoever he will.</hi> As a Man can dispose
of a Water-Course, turn it hither and thither,
as the Necessities of his Field or Garden require:
So can God draw out the Hearts and Respects of
Men. Surely there would not be so many Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in the World, if we did often reflect upon
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Attribute, or did deal with God about his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47528:84"/>
Power over the Spirits of Men. We are wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and think nothing but the Confusion of Men
would serve the Turn; and there is no Riddance
of our Burthen, but by the Destruction of those
who stand in our way: Whereas the Conversion
of Men, a Change of their Spirits and Hearts,
would be a better Cure, and bring more Honour
to God, and Safety with it. The truth is, we
look more to Men than to God; and that is the
Reason why we pitch rather upon the Destruction,
than the Conversion of others: Destruction, that
may be executed by the Creature; but Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is a Power (to order and regulate the
Spirits of Men) which God hath reserved in his
own hands. One Angel could destroy above an
Hundred and Eighty Thousand in <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s
Camp, in one Night; but all the Angels, with
their united Strength, cannot draw in one Heart
to God. But now the <hi>God of the Spirits of all
Flesh,</hi> who is too hard for him? O did we often
reflect upon this, we would be dealing with God
about this Matter, that he would work upon the
Spirits of Men. If there be a wicked Ruler, or
an obstinate Child or Servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he would
sanctify himself upon them, and change their
Hearts.</p>
               <p>2. You discover much Love to God, when as you
would not dishonour him your selves, so you are
careful others may not dishonour him. <hi>Praise
him, all ye Ends of the Earth.</hi> Psal. 98. 4. &amp; 100. 1.
You would have all the World own him. Private
Spirits, that would impale and enclose Religion,
that they may shine alone, they do not love God,
but themselves, their own Credit, and their own
Profit. <hi>Would to God all the Lord's People were
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47528:85"/>
Prophets!</hi> Numb. 11. 29. That was a free and
noble Speech. God is resembled to the Sun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is He that must shine alone; but the
Church is compared to the Moon and Stars, where
all may shine, but every Star in its own glory.
True Christians would have all to be as they are,
unless it be with respect to their Bonds and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances.</p>
               <p>3. You discover Love to others, you would
have them glorify God. The Angels, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
when a Sinner is converted; they have a
great Love to Souls. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 7. And so do
Christians; the more spiritual they are, the more
they come near to the blessed Spirits above, and
the more affected they are with the good done to
others, and with their Conversion. Saith <hi>Paul,</hi>
Rom. 9. 3. <hi>I could wish that my self were accursed
from Christ, for my Brethren, my Kinsmen according
to the Flesh:</hi> Such a Zeal and entire Affection he
had to the Souls of others, that he could lay all
his personal Happiness at Christ's feet. And thus
you see what need we have to deal seriously with
God in this Business, if indeed we make this our
Aim: Especially those which are in publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
as <hi>Paul</hi> was, which had an Office put
upon him to procure the Salvation of others;
how will their Hearts run out upon it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> It is needful we should deal with
God about the sanctifying of his Name, as in
regard of Persons, so of <hi>Things</hi> and Events. God
hath the disposal of all Events in his own hands.
There are many Things which concern the <hi>Glory
of God,</hi> that are out of our Reach, and are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in God's hands; and therefore it discovers our
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47528:85"/>
Love to his <hi>Glory,</hi> and our Submission to his wise and
powerful <hi>Government</hi> of all Affairs, when we deal
with God about it, and refer the Matter to his
disposal, and say; Lord, <hi>hallowed be thy Name,</hi>
take the Work into thy own hands. We discover
our Love to his Glory, because we make it a part
of our Request, that all these Events may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the glory of his Majesty. As <hi>Ioshua,</hi> when
<hi>Israel</hi> fell before their Enemies, <hi>Iosh. 7. 9. Lord,
what wilt thou do for thy great Name?</hi> There was
his Trouble. And <hi>Moses,</hi> Numb. 14. 15, 16.
What will <hi>the Nations say</hi> round about? <hi>Because
the Lord was not able to bring this People into the
Land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath
slain them in the Wilderness.</hi> It goeth near to the
Heart of God's Children, when they see any
thing that will tend to God's Reproach.</p>
               <p>But that is not all; it is not enough we discover
that, but also our Submission to his wise and
powerful Government, when we refer the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to his disposal, and can see that he can work
out his own Ends, out of all the Confusions which
happen there, out of Sins, Errors, Wars, Blood.
Psal. 76. 10. <hi>The Wrath of Man shall praise thee;
the Remainder of Wrath shalt thou restrain.</hi> In the
Septuagint it is, the Wrath of Man shall <hi>keep
Holy-Day</hi> to thee, shall increase a Festival for
thee. God many times gets up in the World,
upon Satan's Shoulders. When Matters are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
and disordered, he can find out the right
End of the Thread, and how to disentangle us
again; and when we have spoil'd a Business, he
can dispose it for good, and make an Advantage
of those things which seem to obscure the Glory
of his Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:47528:86"/>
By the way, both these must go together; our
Love to his <hi>Glory,</hi> and our Submission to his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>
Our Love to his <hi>Glory;</hi> for we should
not be altogether wretchless and careless how
Things go; and yet not <hi>carking,</hi> because of the
Wisdom and Power of his Providence. The
truth is, we should be more sollicitous about <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
than <hi>Events.</hi> The <hi>Glory</hi> of Events belongeth
to God himself, and we are not to take his Work
out of his hand, but mind him in it. Look as
some would lern their School-fellows Lesson bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than their own; so, we would have Things
carried thus and thus: And so by murmuring we
tax Providence, rather than adore it, and we
eclipse the <hi>Glory of God.</hi> Yet we must be sensible
of the Reproaches cast upon God, and must pray
the Lord to vindicate and right his Name, to take
the Way and Means into his own hands.</p>
               <p>Thus you have seen the Necessity of putting up
such a Request to God, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Is for Information. It informs us, That
whatever we bestow upon God, we have it from
God at first. 1 <hi>Chron. 29. 11. Of thine own have
we given thee.</hi> The King of all the Earth, we
cannot pay him any Tribute, but out of his own
Exchequer. When we are best affected to God's
Interest, and pray for God's Concernments, we
must beg the Grace which maketh us to do so. It
is his own Gift: It is he must enable and incline
us, quicken and direct us. So that in all Things
he is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega;</hi> we begin in him, when
ever we end in him: And when we do most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
God, we have all from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:47528:86"/>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For Direction in the Matter of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
God, in four Propositions.</p>
               <p>1. This Life is not to be valued, but as it
yieldeth us Opportunities for this End and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to glorify God. We were not sent into
the World to live for our selves, but for God. If
we could make our selves, then we could live to
our selves: If we could be our own Cause, then
we might be our own End. But God made us
for himself, and sent us into the World for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Christ saith, <hi>Iohn 17. 4. Father, I have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
thee on Earth,</hi> &amp;c. It is not our Duty only
to glorify God in Heaven, to join in Consort
with the Angels in their Hallelujahs above, where
we may glorify him without Distraction, Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Weakness; but here on <hi>Earth,</hi> in the
midst of Difficulties and Temptations. There
are none sent into the World to be idle, or to
<hi>bring forth Fruit to themselves,</hi> Hos. 10. 1. to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their Pains and Strength, to promote meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their own Interest; but God's Glory must be
our chief Work and Aim, while we are here upon
Earth; this must be the Purpose and Intent of
our Lives.</p>
               <p>2. Every Man, besides his general Calling, hath
his own Work and Course of Service, whereby
to glorify and honour God. <hi>Iohn 17. 4. I have
finished the Work which thou gavest me to do.</hi> As in
a great House, one hath one Employment, one
another: So God hath designed to every Man
his Work he hath to do, and the Calling he must
be in; some in one Calling, and some in another;
but they all have their Service and Work given
them to do for God's glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:47528:87"/>
3. In discharge of this Work, as they must do
all for God, so they can do nothing without God.
Every morning we should revive the Sense of it
upon our selves, as the Care of our Work and
Aim, so the Sense of our Impotency: This day
I am to live with God; but how unable am I?
and how easily shall I dishonour him? <hi>The way of
Man is not in himself.</hi> Jer. 10. 23. When a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
goeth abroad in the Morning, he must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
he is at Christ's dispose; he is not to do
as he pleaseth, but to be guided by Rule, and act
for God's glory, and fetch in Strength from
Christ. <hi>Col. 3. 17. Whatsoever ye do in Word or
Deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Iesus:</hi> Not
only in our Duties, or immediate Converses with
God, but in our Sports, Business, Recreation.
What is it to do things in the Name of Christ?
That is, to do it according to Christ's Will and
Command. He hath allowed us Time for Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
for conversing with God, and calling in
Christ's Help, and aiming at his Glory. If we
have any thing to do for God, we must do it in
his own strength, in every Word and Deed.</p>
               <p>4. You are directed again, when the Glory of
God, and sanctifying of his Name, either sticks
with us, or sticks abroad, God must be specially
consulted with in the Case. When our Hearts
are backward; then, <hi>Lord, open thou my Lips;</hi>
Lord, affect me with a sense of thy Kindness and
Mercy. When it sticks <hi>abroad,</hi> when such Events
fall out, as for a while God's Name is obscured,
and seems to be clouded; <hi>Lord, what wilt thou do
for thy great Name?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:47528:87"/>
III. Having opened the Order of the Words,
and the Reasons of putting up such a Request to
God, I now come to the <hi>Sence</hi> of the Petition,
<hi>Hallowed be thy Name.</hi> Four Things will come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     <item>4. The Note of Distinction, <hi>Thy</hi> Name.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First; What is meant by <hi>God's Name?</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>God</hi> himself.</item>
                     <item>2. Any Thing whereby he is made known.</item>

that is, of Persons. So it is used in the present
Case: <hi>God's Name</hi> is put for <hi>God himself.</hi> Psal.
20. 1. <hi>The Name of the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>defend thee!</hi>
That is, <hi>God himself.</hi> So, <hi>Psal. 44. 5. Through
thy Name will we tread them under, that rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us;</hi> that is, by <hi>Thee.</hi> And to believe in
the <hi>Name</hi> of Christ, is to believe in Christ <hi>himself.
Name</hi> is put for <hi>Person;</hi> for the immediate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Faith, is the Person of Christ. <hi>Iohn 1. 12.
To as many as received him, to them gave he Power to
become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on
his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Any thing whereby he is made known to
us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Nomen quasi not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>men.</hi> As a Man is known by
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47528:88"/>
his Name; so God's Titles and Attributes, his
Ordinances, his Works, his Word, are his Name;
chiefly the two latter. For his <hi>Works,</hi> they are a
part of the Name of God: <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 1. the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of that Psalm is twice repeated; <hi>O Lord,
our Lord, how great is thy Name in all the Earth!</hi>
By the Name there, is meant, God made known
in his Works of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence;</hi> for he
speaks there of Sun, Moon, and Stars, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
an Eternal Power to all the World; and
he speaks of such a Name as is in all the <hi>Earth.</hi>
And, <hi>Psal. 117. 19, 20. He hath not dealt so with
any Nation,</hi> and given them his Word, Statutes,
and Ordinances; every one hath not that Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege:
But, <hi>How great is thy Name in all the Earth!</hi>
That is, how manifestly art thou made known by
thy Works! But above all, by <hi>Name</hi> is meant
his Word: <hi>Psal. 138. 2. Thou hast magnified thy
Word above all thy Name.</hi> There is more of God
to be seen in his Word, than in all the Creatures
of the World, and in all his other Works besides.
We understand more of God, than can be taken
up by the Creation: It helps us to interpret the
Book of Nature and Providence; there we have
his Titles, Attributes, Ordinances; there we
have his greatest Work, in which he hath disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
so much of his Name, the Mystery of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
which is not elsewhere to be known.
Thus by the <hi>Name of God,</hi> is meant <hi>God</hi> himself,
as he hath made known himself in the Word:
We desire that he may be sanctified, that he may
with honour and reverence be received every
where.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The second Thing to be explained;
What is meant by <hi>Hallowed?</hi> In Scripture <hi>God</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:47528:88"/>
is said sometimes to be <hi>magnified,</hi> sometimes to be
<hi>justified,</hi> sometimes to be <hi>glorified,</hi> and sometimes
to be <hi>sanctified.</hi> Now it is not here said, <hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficetur
nomen tuum,</hi> or <hi>glorificetur,</hi> but <hi>san<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tur,</hi>
Let thy Name be sanctified. All these Terms do
express how <hi>God</hi> is to be honoured by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and they have all distinct Notions. <hi>God</hi>
is said to be <hi>magnified,</hi> Luke 1. 46. <hi>My Soul doth
magnify the Lord.</hi> To magnify God, argueth a
high esteem, or a due sense of his <hi>Greatness.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>God</hi> is said to be <hi>justified,</hi> Luke 7. 29. <hi>The
People and the Publicans justified God.</hi> What is it
to justify <hi>God?</hi> To justify, is to acq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it from Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation;
and when that Word is applied to
<hi>God,</hi> it signifieth our owning of him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Prejudices of the World against
him. To <hi>glorify</hi> God, is to make him known
to others, and to bring him into Request wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h
others; for <hi>Glory,</hi> it is <hi>clara cum laude notitia,</hi> a
publick Fame or Knowledg of Excellency. Thus
Christ saith, <hi>Iohn 17. 10. I am glorified in them;</hi>
speaking of his Apostles, because by their means
he was <hi>made known to the World.</hi> All these are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the Word of the Text. Yet there is
somewhat more intended by <hi>to be sanctified:</hi>
When is God then said to be sanctified?</p>
               <p>To hallow, and to sanctify, is to set apart
from common Use; and so to sanctify the Name
of God, is to <hi>use it in a separa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e manner, with that
reverence and respect which is not used to any thing
else.</hi> So that when we pray, that God's Name
may be h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llowed or sanctified, we desire, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he hath made known himself in the
Word, so he may be known, reverenced, and
esteemed in the World; known to be the only
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47528:89"/>
true <hi>God;</hi> 1 Kings 18. 36. <hi>Let it be known this day,
that thou art God in</hi> Israel; and accordingly
worshipped and glorified in the Hearts and Lives
of Men.</p>
               <p>The third Thing to open, is the Form of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: It is not <hi>sanctificemus,</hi> let us
hallow; but <hi>sanctificetur,</hi> let it be hallowed: For
in this Form of Speech, all the Persons concerned
in this Work are included, God, our selves, and
others.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>God</hi> is to be included in the Prayer, that we
may express our sense of his Providence, working
all things for the glory of his holy Name, yea,
discovering his Excellency, shewing himself to be
the holy God. <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k. 38. 23. I will magnify my
self, and sanctify my self, and I will be known in the
Eyes of many Nations, and they shall know that I am
the Lord.</hi> The Lord magnifieth himself, by the
more eminent Effects of his Care and Providence;
but he sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ieth himself chiefly, by blessing and
defending the <hi>Godly,</hi> and by punishing and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Wicked; for thereby he declareth his
Holiness, the Purity of his Nature, and his Love
to Saints. So that when we say, <hi>Hallowed be thy
Name,</hi> we mean; Lord, declare thy self to be a
holy God, by putting a distinction between Men
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd Men in the course of thy Providence, and
owning thy People from Heaven.</p>
               <p>2. We include <hi>our selves,</hi> when we say, <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ed
be thy Name;</hi> for it is especially the Duty of
God's People. <hi>Isa. 29. 23. They shall sanctify my
Name, and sanctify the Holy One of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>all fear the God of</hi> Israel. It is our Duty, by
our religious Carriage to evidence that we have a
holy God. This must be our first Care, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47528:89"/>
we our selves be sanctified, and to sanctify our
Sanctifier, the Holy One of <hi>Israel.</hi> Some, they
would have God glorified by others, but do not
look to themselves, how they sanctify God. Now
God hath made this to be a great part of our
Care, that his own People should not only magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
and glorify him, but sanctify him; therefore
he rather makes them good than great. When
he would make Men great, then he shews his
Magnificence, to be the Almighty Disposer of the
Riches of the World; but when he makes them
good, then he expects to be sanctified, that his
People should discover, that he is a holy One;
that he is holy in himself, for we add nothing to
him, when we sanctify him, but only discover
him to be such an one. In short, God sanctifieth
us <hi>effectively,</hi> by working Grace and Holiness in us;
and we sanctify him <hi>relatively, objectively, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively,</hi>
declaring him to be a holy God, and that
we are a People belonging to this God.</p>
               <p>3. The Speech is so formed, that others may be
included, and that we may express our Sense of
their dishonouring God, as a thing that is grievous
to us; that we may shew how near it goeth to
our Heart, to see the Ignorance, Atheism, and
Blasphemy that is in the World. They would
have the holy God to be sanctified abroad, either
by the Conversion of Men, or by their Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And so it is meant, <hi>Isa. 5. 16. God that
is holy, shall be sanctified in Righteousness:</hi> That
is, his Holiness, and Hatred of Sin shall appear,
either in the Conversion of obstinate Sinners,
that God may be sanctified by them; or else
for Punishment, that God may be sanctified upon
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:47528:90"/>
Fourthly, The next thing is the note of Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>Hallowed be [thy] Name,</hi> not ours. There
seems to be a secret opposition between our Name,
and the Name of God. When we come to pray,
we should distinctly remember whose Name is to
be glorified, that God may be at the end of every
Request. We beg of God many times, but we
think of our selves, our Hearts run upon our own
Name, and upon our own Esteem. How often
do we come to him with a selfish aim, as if we
would draw God into our own Designs and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses?
None are so un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it to glorify God, and so
unwelcome to him, as those that are so wedded
and vehemently addicted to their own Honour and
Esteem in the World. Therefore Christ by way
of Distinction, by way of Opposition to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Disposition that is in us, he would have us to
say, <hi>Hallowed by THY Name.</hi> That which gives
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ost Honour to God, is believing. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 19, 20.
Abraham <hi>was strong in Faith, giving Glory to God.</hi>
Now none so unfit for the work, as they that seek
Glory for themselves, Joh. 5. 44. <hi>How can ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
which receive honour one of another, and seek
not the honour that cometh from God only?</hi> Affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Vain-Glory, or Splendor of our own Name,
is a temper inconsistent with Faith, which is the
Grace that gives honour to God. I say, when
we hunt after Respect from Men, and make that
the chiefest scope of our Actions, God's Glory
will certainly lye in the Dust; when we are to
suffer ignominy and Abasement for his sake, the
care of God's Glory will be laid aside. The great
Sin of the old-World was this, <hi>Gen. 11. 4. Let us
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a Name.</hi> There are many Conceits about
that Enterprize, what that People should aim at
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47528:90"/>
there, in building so great and so vast a Tower,
before God confounded their Tongues. Some
interpreting that place, <hi>Let us build us a Tower
even to Heaven,</hi> think this was their intention to
make a way into Heaven. But it is not likely
they would be so foolish that had so late Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Flood, and when the Ark rested upon
the top of the highest Mountains, found themselves
to be at so great and vast a distance from Heaven.
Some think it was (as <hi>Iosephus</hi>) to secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from another Flood: But that was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
done by God's Promise, who had engaged
to them he would no more destroy the Earth by
Water; and if that were their intention, why
should they build in the Plain, between the two
Rivers of <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates? Moses</hi> gives the
main reason there, that they might have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<hi>Name</hi> among Posterity. But now see how
ill they reckon, that do reckon without God. Those
that are so busy about their own Name, how soon
will God blast them! When in any Action we do
not seek Glory to God, but our selves, it's the
ready way to be destroyed. This was the Means
to bury them in perpetual Oblivion. <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
when he re-edified the City, Dan. 4. 30.
<hi>Is not this great</hi> Babylon <hi>that I have built for the
House of the Kingdom, by the might of my Power, and
for the honour of my Majesty?</hi> How doth God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
him, and turn him out among the Beasts?
Thus are we sure to be disappointed and blasted,
when our Hearts run altogether upon our own
Name. But now Christ saith [<hi>Thy Name</hi>] when
we are careful of that, this is the way to pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:47528:91"/>
From the Words thus illustrated, I shall only
observe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That God will be so glorified in the World,
as that his Name may be hallowed or sanctified.</p>
               <p>Here I shall shew,
<list>
                     <item>1. How many ways God's Name is sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</item>
                     <item>2. Why God will be so glorified, as that he may
be sanctified.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, How many Ways is God's Name sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?
I answer, either upon us, or by us.</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>Vpon us,</hi> by the righteous Executions and
Judgments of his Providence. And so God is san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
when <hi>he doth by a high hand of Power, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and extort the Glory of his Holiness from the dead
and stupid World.</hi> As by that notable stroke of the
<hi>Bethshemites,</hi> when <hi>Fifty thousand were slain for peep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Ark; 1 Sam.</hi> 6. 20. This was the result
of all, <hi>Who is able to stand before this Holy Lord God?</hi>
There he discovered himself to be a Holy God, to
be one that hath a high displeasure against the
Creatures Disobedience. Now when he doth by
a high hand extort this from the Wicked, or
from his Children, then he sanctifieth himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us.</p>
               <p>(2.) <hi>By us.</hi> And so he is sanctified, in our
Thoughts, Words, and Actions; in our Heart,
Tongue, or Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:47528:91"/>
1. In our <hi>Hearts;</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 15. <hi>Sanctify the Lord
God in your Heart.</hi> How is God sanctified in our
Hearts?</p>
               <p>(1.) When we have awful Thoughts of his
Majesty, Psal. 111. 9. <hi>Holy and Reverend is his
Name.</hi> Not only when we <hi>speak</hi> of the Name of
God, but when we <hi>think</hi> of it, we should be seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
affected. But,</p>
               <p>(2.) More especially God is sanctified, <hi>when in
Straits, Difficulties, and Dangers, we can bear our
selves upon the power and sufficiency of God, and go on
resolutely and chearfully with our Duty, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Discouragements.</hi> This is <hi>to sanctify the Lord
God in our Hearts.</hi> I shall prove it by two places
where the Phrase is used; one is, 1 Pet. 3. 15.
<hi>Be ready always to give an answer to every Man that
asketh you a reason of the Hope that is in you, with
Meekness and Fear.</hi> Mark, the Christians that did
profess the Name of God, which spake of God as
their Hope, or Object of their Religion, were in
great danger: Now what direction doth he give
them, that they might not be afraid, but bear up?
For he speaks before, <hi>Be not afraid of their Terror,
or be troubled: But sanctify the Lord God in your
Hearts.</hi> See the same Phrase used for the same
purpose, Isa. 8. 13. <hi>Sanctify the Lord of Hosts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and let him be your Fear, and let him be your
Dread.</hi> He opposeth it plainly there, to <hi>Carnal
Fear,</hi> vers. 12. <hi>Say ye not a Confederacy, to all them
to whom this People shall say a Confederacy; neither
fear ye their Fear, nor be afraid: But sanctify the
Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your Fear.</hi> How
comes this direction to be used in the present Case?
Thus, to sanctify is to set apart, and to sanctify
God, is to set God apart as the alone Object of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47528:92"/>
Fear and Trust, that he alone is to be feared and
trusted; so that we can see no match for God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Creatures: Therefore we are to embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
our selves in the Lord, and go on chearfully;
when we <hi>can counter-ballance all Fears and Dangers
with his surpassing Excellency.</hi> To <hi>Glorify God,</hi> is,
to do that which simply and absolutely tendeth to
the Manifestation of his Excellency, without any
Relation to the Creature: But to <hi>Sanctify God,</hi> is,
to set God above the Creature, to do that which
tends to exalt his Greatness and Excellency from
and above all Terrors, and all the Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that we can have from the Creature: It is
to ascribe that Greatness, that Power and Glory
to God alone, which cannot be ascribed to any
thing else, and so to go on chearfully with our
Duty, whatever Difficulties we meet with. Thus
<hi>Moses</hi> was chidden, that was amazed with present
Difficulty, Numb. 20. 12. <hi>And the Lord spake unto</hi>
Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>Because ye believed me not, to
sanctify me in the Eyes of the Children of</hi> Israel; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye shall not bring this Congregation into the Land
which I have given them.</hi> Because they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
and thought they should never carry
on their Business, therefore God saith, <hi>Ye believe
not to sanctify me:</hi> You sanctify not God, or set
him aloft, as the alone and Supream Object of
Fear and Trust. It is <hi>a practical acknowledgment
of God's matchless Excellency.</hi> Thus we sanctify
God in our Hearts.</p>
               <p>2. God is sanctified with our <hi>Tongues,</hi> when we
use God's Name, Titles, Ordinances, and Word,
as Holy Things. When we speak of the Lord
with Reverence, and with great seriousness of
Heart, <hi>not tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng his Name in vain;</hi> especially when
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47528:92"/>
we are deeply affected with his Praise. It is no
slight thing to praise God. God's People when
they have gone about it, see a need of the greatest
Help. Psal. 51. 15. <hi>O Lord, open thou my Lips,
and my Mouth shall shew forth thy Praise.</hi> And Psal.
45. 1. <hi>My Heart is inditing a good matter;</hi> my
Heart frys or boyls a good Matter. When we
will not give God Dough-bak'd Praise, nor speak
of his Name slightly, but so as becomes his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and surpassing Excellency.</p>
               <p>3. In our <hi>Actions.</hi> Our Actions may be parted
into two things; <hi>Worship,</hi> and <hi>ordinary Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. In our <hi>Worship,</hi> there God especially will be
sanctified. Lev. 10. 3. <hi>I will be sanctified in all that
draw near unto me.</hi> God is very tender of his
Worship: <hi>Sancta Sanctis,</hi> Holy Things must be
managed by Holy Men, in a Holy Manner. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what is it to sanctify God, when we draw
nigh to him? To have a more excellent frame of
Heart in Worship, than we have about other
things. As in <hi>Prayer,</hi> the frame of our Hearts
must not be common, we must not go about it
with such a frame of Heart, as we go about our
Callings, worldly Business, and Converses with
Men; but there must be some special Reverence,
such as is peculiar to him. When we draw near
to God in the <hi>Word,</hi> he will be sanctified. The
Word must be received with Meekness, and by
Faith applied to our Souls, as an Instrument de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to our endless Good. When we have a
peculiar Reverence for God, and a respect to God
in all our Approaches; Eccles. 5. 1. <hi>Look to thy
Feet when thou goest to the House of God:</hi> we must
not go about these Holy Services Hand over Head,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47528:93"/>
but with great Caution and Heed. Thus is God
sanctified in Worship, or in our immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with him.</p>
               <p>2. In our <hi>ordinary Conversation.</hi> Then God is
sanctified; when <hi>our Life is ordered so, that we
may give Men occasion to say, that surely he is a Holy
God whom we serve.</hi> By two things you may know
you sanctify God in your Conversations; when
you walk as <hi>remembring</hi> you have a Holy God;
and when you walk as <hi>discovering</hi> to others you
have a Holy God.</p>
               <p>(1.) When you walk as <hi>remembring</hi> your selves
that you have a Holy God, therefore you must
be watchful and strict. It is notable, when the
<hi>Israelites</hi> were making a hasty Promise, <hi>Ioshua</hi>
puts them in Mind, Chap. 24. 9. <hi>You cannot serve
the Lord, for he is a Holy God.</hi> So we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
when we give up our selves to God, he is
a Holy and Jealous God, that is narrowly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and he will not be put off with any thing
that is Common.</p>
               <p>(2.) As <hi>discovering</hi> you have a Holy God. A
carnal Worshipper prophaneth the Memory of
God in the World. But now a Christian that
walks according to his Holy Calling, that is Holy
in all manner of Conversation, he discovereth
what a God he hath. 1 Pet. 2. 9. <hi>That ye should
shew forth the Praises of him, who hath called you out of
Darkness into his marvellous Light.</hi> We are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to conceive, and make use of them to beget
Fear and Reverence in our Hearts of the All-seeing
God; but are to shew them forth, to evidence
them to others: We should discover more than a
Human Excellency, that so those which look upon
us may say, these are the Servants of the Holy
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:47528:93"/>
Secondly, For the Reasons, Why God will be
so glorified, that he may be sanctified.</p>
               <p>1. Because this is the Glory that is due to his
Name; Psal. 96. 8. <hi>Give unto the Lord the Glory
due to his Name.</hi> Every Glory will not serve the
turn, but such Glory as is proper and peculiar for
that God we serve. It is a stated Rule in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
That <hi>Respects to God must be proportioned to
the Nature of God.</hi> God is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> therefore will
be worshipped in <hi>Spirit and Truth.</hi> God is a God
of <hi>Peace,</hi> therefore lift up pure Hands, without
<hi>Wrath and Doubting.</hi> God is a <hi>Holy God,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will be <hi>sanctified.</hi> They which worship the
Sun, among the Heathens, they used a Flying-Horse,
as a thing most suitable to the swift Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Sun. Well then, they that will glorify
and honour God with a Glory due to his Name,
must sanctify him as well as honour him: Why?
for <hi>God is glorious in Holiness,</hi> Exod. 15. 11. This
is that which God counteth to be his chief Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
and the Glory which he will manifest among
the Sons of Men.</p>
               <p>2. This is that Glory which God affects, and
therefore the Saints will give it him. <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 3. The
Holy Angels, what do they cry out when they
honour God? They do not acknowledg his Power
and Dominion over all Creatures as Lord of all;
but they give him his peculiar Glory, <hi>Holy, Holy,
Holy, is the Lord of Hosts, the whole Earth is full of
his Glory.</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 103. 1. <hi>Bless the Lord, O
my Soul, yea, all that is within me bless his Holy Name.</hi>
That's the Notion upon which he pitcheth, he
would praise God with such praise as is welcome
and acceptable to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:47528:94"/>
3. This is that Attribute which is most eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and most blotted out in the Hearts of the
Sons of Men, because of God's Patience, because
he doth not take Vengeance of all the Sins of Men:
<hi>Thou thoughtest I was altogether such a one as thy self,</hi>
Psal. 50. 21. Certainly if Men did not blot and
stain God in their Thoughts, if they did not fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
an unreasonable Indulgence, such as is not
comely and proper to his Majesty, they could not
go on in Sin, and think God could be so pure;
therefore he will be so glorified, that he may be
sanctified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> To press us so to glorify God, as we may
also sanctify him. Let this be your care. To
quicken you, remember,</p>
               <p>1. God is much offended with his People that
do not sanctify him. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> as choice
and as dear to God as they were, yet you know
what the Lord saith, Numb. 20. 12. <hi>Because ye
believed me not, to sanctify me in the Eyes of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of</hi> Israel; <hi>therefore ye shall not bring this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
into the Land which I have given them.</hi>
When <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> murmured, and spake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly,
and did not sanctify him, nor carry
God's Excellency aloft, <hi>They shall not enter.</hi> And
God remembreth this a great while after, in that
Deut. 32. 51. <hi>Because ye trespassed against me among
the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>at the Waters of</hi> Meribah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kadesh,
<hi>in the Wilderness of</hi> Zin; <hi>because ye sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
me not in the midst of the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>thou
shalt not go unto the Land which I give the Children of</hi>
Israel. Well then, tho God's Children should
get to Heaven, yet if they do not sanctify God,
they will want many a Priviledg. God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47528:94"/>
this against them; for he takes it ill,
when his People will not sanctify him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
his peculiar Excellency.</p>
               <p>2. If you do not sanctify God, then you pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
God, and stain his Memory in the World;
Ezek. 36. 20. <hi>Ye have profaned my Holy Name among
the Heathen.</hi> How is God polluted? Not intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secally,
God cannot receive any Pollution from
us. It is here, as in that Case, <hi>A Man that lusteth
after a Woman, hath committed Adultery with her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in his Heart,</hi> Mat. 5. 28. The Man pollutes
the Woman in his Heart, while she remains spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and undefiled: So in this Case, we blemish
God in appearance, as much as in us lies we pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and blot God, tho he remains pure and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.
You make Heathens think as if you had an
unholy God. Well then, glorify God.</p>
               <p>For Directions,
<list>
                     <item>1. Be Holy. The Praise of the Wicked is a
disgrace to him, it is an obscuring of his Praise,
1 Pet. 1. 15. <hi>As he which hath called you is holy, so
be ye holy in all manner of Conversation.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Study his Name, if ye would sanctify his
Name. Psal. 9. 10. <hi>They that know his Name will
put their trust in him.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. Submit to his Providence without Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
When we can speak well of him, tho he seem
to deal most hardly; as the <hi>Bethshemites,</hi> when
there was such a Slaughter made among them,
fifty thousand slain: They do not say, murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
who can stand before this <hi>severe, cruel
God?</hi> but before this <hi>Holy God?</hi> They own his
Holiness in the Dispensation, tho it were so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 20. It is a great Glory to God
when you own him as just in all his ways, when
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47528:95"/>
he deals most hardly. Whatsoever be our Lot
and Portion, yet he is a Holy God. But to cavil
and murmur, it is to tax and blemish God before
the World.</item>
                     <item>4. Live to publick Ends, that is to draw God
into Request with others: Let this be the aim of
your Conversation, not only to get Holiness e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to bring you to Heaven, but to allure
others, and recommend God to them, that by the
Purity and Strictness of your Conversation you
might gain upon others, and bring them to be in
love with God, and acquainted with him.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And Lastly, be sensible when God's Name is
dishonoured, by your selves and others, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
the least prophanation of it.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Thy Kingdom come.</head>
               <p>THE first Petition concerneth the End, the
rest the means. Now among all the Means,
none hath such a near and immediate respect to
the Glory of God as Christ's Kingdom; for
here there is more of God discovered, more of
his infinite Grace, Justice, Wisdom, and Power,
than possibly can be elsewhere: All other things
are for the Church, and the Church for Christ as
Head and King, and Christ for God, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 22,
23.</hi> So that Christ's Kingdom is the primary
Means of advancing God's Glory; and therefore
among all the Means it must be sought in the first
place, Mat. 6. 33. <hi>Seek first the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:47528:95"/>
First, not above the Glory of God, it doth not
come in competition with that, but above all
other things whatsoever, before Pardon and
Grace.</p>
               <p>In the Words observe three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. We grant [a <hi>Kingdom.</hi>]</item>
                  <item>2. By way of Distinction and Appropriation,
we say [<hi>Thy Kingdom.</hi>]</item>
                  <item>3. By way of Supplication, we beg of God that
it [may <hi>Come.</hi>]</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Concession, the Distinction, the Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are the three things to be opened.</p>
               <p>First, The Concession of a Kingdom, which
our heavenly Father hath. A Kingdom (in the
general, signifieth the Government of a People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one Head, or Governour; and therefore the
Term may be fitly applied to God, who alone is
Supream, and we are all under his Dominion.</p>
               <p>Now God's Kingdom is twofold:
<list>
                     <item>1. Universal.</item>
                     <item>2. More Particular and Special.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> There's a Universal Kingdom over all
Things; over Angels, and Devils; over Men
Elect, and Reprobate; over Beasts, and Living
Creatures; and over inanimate Things, Sun,
Moon, and Stars. This is spoken of, 1 Chron.
29. 11. <hi>Thine is the Kingdom, O Lord, and thou art
exalted as Head above all.</hi> And again, Psal. 103. 19.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47528:96"/>
                  <hi>The Lord hath prepared his Throne in the Heavens:
and his Kingdom ruleth over all.</hi> There is no such
Monarch as God is, for largeness of Empire, for
absoluteness of Power, and Sublimity of his
Throne. This is not principally understood here,
but is implied as a Foundation and Ground of
Faith, whereupon we may deal with God about
that Kingdom, which is specially intended in this
Request.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> More Particularly and Especially, God
hath a Kingdom over a certain Order and Estate
of Men. Of this especial Kingdom there are two
notable Branches and Considerations. One is,
that Administration which belongeth to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Life, and is called <hi>the Kingdom of Grace;</hi> and
the other belongeth to the Life to come, and is
called <hi>the Kingdom of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The Kingdom of <hi>Grace</hi> is spoken of in many
places, specially that Luk. 17. 20, 21. <hi>When he
was demanded of the</hi> Pharisees, <hi>when the Kingdom of
God should come? he answered them and said, The
Kingdom of God cometh not with Observation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall they say, Lo, here, or, lo, there: for, behold
the Kingdom of God is within you, (or among you.)</hi>
He speaks of a Kingdom of God that was already
come among them, in the dispensation of his
Grace by Christ. And then, the other belongeth
to the Life to come, called <hi>the Kingdom of Glory,</hi>
Mat. 25. 34. <hi>Come ye Blessed of my Father, inherit
the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of
the World.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 50. <hi>Flesh and Blood cannot
inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Kingdom of <hi>Grace</hi> may be considered
two ways; as Externally administred; and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
received.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:47528:96"/>
(1.) As <hi>Externally</hi> administred in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Means of Grace, as the Word, and Seals,
and Censures, and the like. In this Sence it is
said, Mat. 21. 43. <hi>The Kingdom of God shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from you, and given to a Nation, bringing forth
the Fruits thereof.</hi> The Gospel, or Means of Grace,
administred in the visible Face of the Church, they
are called God's Kingdom upon Earth, and a very
great Priviledg they are, when they are bestowed
upon any People. Surely, when Christ saith,
<hi>The Kingdom of God shall be taken from you,</hi> he doth
not mean it of the inward Kingdom, that they
had not, that cannot be lost, but of the outward
and external Means.</p>
               <p>(2.) As <hi>internally</hi> received: and then by it is
meant the Grace of God, which rules in the
Hearts of the Elect, and causeth their Souls to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and subject themselves unto the Obedience of
Christ, and unto his Scepter, and to his Word
and Spirit, and this is that <hi>Kingdom properly which
is within us.</hi> This is the <hi>Kingdom of God which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in Righteousness, Peace, and Ioy in the Holy
Ghost,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. And this differeth from
the Kingdom of Glory, not so much in <hi>Nature,</hi> as
in <hi>Degree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, That by the Kingdom of God is
here meant, not his general Empire over all the
World, and all the things of the World (tho that
be not wholly excluded); but his special King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which he doth administer by Christ: And
that either as externally managed by Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and visible means of Grace; or as internally
received and administred in the Hearts of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.
This is that Kingdom we beg, that it may
flourish and get ground more and more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:47528:97"/>
2. Then for the Kingdom of <hi>Glory,</hi> it is either
begun and inchoate, or else consummate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>1. 'Tis begun and inchoate upon our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Heaven, in the very moment of Death:
In which Christ reigns in the other World, in the
Spirits of just Men made perfect (that is) being
perfectly freed from Sin, and admitted into the
clear and immediate Vision and Fruition of God,
tho our Bodies abide in the Grave, expecting full
Redemption and Deliverance. That there is
such a Kingdom carried on, many Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
Phil. 1. 23. <hi>I desire to depart, and to be with
Christ.</hi> As soon as the Saints are loosed from the
Body, they are with Christ under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Luk. 23. 43. <hi>This day shalt thou be with me
in Paradise.</hi> As soon as Christ died he was in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
and there was the good Thief with him.
The Scriptures do not establish any such drousy
conceit as the Sleep of Souls; or such an Estate
wherein they do not enjoy God. We read of <hi>the
Spirits of just Men made perfect,</hi> which make up the
Congregation which is above, of which Christ is
Head, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. As the Spirits of the Wicked
are in Prison, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. that is, in Hell. This
is the Kingdom of Glory begun.</p>
               <p>2. There's a Kingdom of Glory consummate;
when Sin, and Death is utterly abolished, and
the Elect perfectly separated from the Reprobate,
and conducted into Heaven, and there remain
with the Lord for ever. This is a Kingdom,
Mat. 25. 34. <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the Kingdom prepared for you.</hi> The full and final
Estate we enjoy after the general Judgment and
Resurrection, that's called a Kingdom. Well,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47528:97"/>
now you see what's meant by the Kingdom we
pray for.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Here's a note of Distinction, [<hi>Thy
Kingdom;</hi>] by which the Kingdom here spoken of
is limited by particular reference to God; not
only to difference it from the Kingdoms of <hi>Men,</hi>
which are subordinate to it; but those adverse
Kingdoms which are set up <hi>against God;</hi> as the
Kingdom of Sin, Satan, Anti-christ, the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of which we intend when we pray for the
advancement of God's Kingdom; As I shall shew
you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Here's the Supplication, or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
which we make to God about this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Let it [<hi>Come.</hi>] What do we
mean by that? This Word must be applied
to the several acceptations of Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>1. If you apply it to the <hi>External Kingdom of
Grace,</hi> then when we say, [<hi>Thy Kingdom come;</hi>]
the meaning is, Let the Gospel be published, let
Churches be set up every where, let them be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
and maintained against all the malignity
of the World, and Opposition of the Devil:
And in the publication of the Gospel where the
sound of it hath not been heard, that God would
come there in the Power of his Spirit, and draw
People into Communion with himself. Mat. 12. 28.
<hi>If I cast out Devils by the Spirit of God, then the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is come unto you;</hi> meaning in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
tenders thereof. Saith he, if this Miracle
doth clearly (as it doth in your Consciences) evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
my Mission, then you may know the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47528:98"/>
of God is come, (that is) that there is a
Publication of the Gospel of Grace. Then we
pray for the continuance of this Privilege, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
opposition, that Christ may stand
his Ground. This is that we seek of God, that
he may maintain his Interest among the Nations
of the World, that the Gates of Hell may not
prevail against his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>2. If you refer it to the <hi>Internal</hi> Part of this
Kingdom, then we beg the Beginning, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
and the final Consummation of it. First,
the <hi>Beginning,</hi> or the Erection of a Throne for
Christ in our own Hearts, and the Hearts of others,
that he may fully exercise Regal Power. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
The Increase of this Kingdom by Holiness
and Obedience, and sincere Subjection to him;
for the Kingdom of Grace is so come already, that
it will still be coming yet more and more. So long
as we need to pray, so long shall we have cause to
say, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi> Thirdly, The <hi>Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
of it, when the Fulness of Glory in the
second Coming of Christ shall be revealed; when
our Head shall be glorious, and his Day shall
come, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: For the present it is <hi>Man's</hi>
Day, so the Scripture seems to call it; but then
it is the Day of the <hi>Lord,</hi> when all the Devils shall
stoop, and Enemies receive their final Doom, and
the Saints shall have the Crown of Glory put
upon their Heads in the Sight of all the World.</p>
               <p>Well, the Sum of all is this, That tho this
Petition do mainly concern the special Kingdom,
which God administreth by Christ; yet God's
universal Kingdom, the Kingdom of his Power
and Providence, is a mighty Support and Prop to
our Faith, in making this Request to God. When we
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47528:98"/>
consider what an unlimited Power God hath over
all Creatures, even Devils themselves, to dispose
of them for his own Glory, and his Churches
Good; we need not to be discouraged, though
Christ's Kingdom be opposed in the World, but
should with the more confidence deal with God
about it.</p>
               <p>That which I shall handle upon this Petition,
will fall under these two Points:
<list>
                     <item>1. That God hath a Kingdom, which he will
administer and manage for his own glory.</item>
                     <item>2. All those which are well affected to God's
glory, should desire the coming of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and seriously deal with God about it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For the first, namely,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That God hath a Kingdom, which he
will administer and manage for his own Glory.</p>
               <p>I speak not of the Kingdom of his Power and
Providence, but of the Dispensation of Grace by
Christ. The Evangelical Gospel-State is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to a Kingdom; as, <hi>Mat. 3. 2. The Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand.</hi> So to the Disciples, <hi>Mat.
10. 7. And as ye go, preach, saying, The Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand.</hi> And so Christ himself.</p>
               <p>It may be called so with very good reason:
For in this Kingdom there is a Monarch, Jesus
Christ, to whom all Power and Authority is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
God the Father calls him, <hi>my King;</hi> Psal.
2. 6. <hi>I have set my King upon my holy Hill.</hi> And
this King hath his Throne in the Consciences of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47528:99"/>
Men, where Thoughts are brought into Captivity
to him. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. And he hath his Royal Scepter,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3. which is called the <hi>Rod of his Strength.</hi>
And he hath his Subjects, and they are the Saints,
<hi>Rev. 15. 3. King of Saints.</hi> And he hath his Laws
and Constitutions; we read of the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi>
and the <hi>Law of Liberty.</hi> And in this Kingdom
there are <hi>Privileges,</hi> and Royal <hi>Immunities;</hi> there's
Freedom from the Curse of the Law, and from
the Power of Sin, and from the destructive Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Satan and the World. And here are
<hi>Punishments</hi> and <hi>Rewards,</hi> both for Body and Soul;
there is Hell and Heaven. Now because all these
things do so fitly suit, therefore is the Gospel cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Kingdom. It will not be amiss to insist
upon some of these.</p>
               <p>1. The State of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or Evangelical State,
'tis God's Kingdom, in regard of the Monarch
whom God hath set up, (that is) Jesus Christ,
the great Lord of all Things. There is no King
like him: <hi>God hath made him higher than the Kings
of the Earth.</hi> Psal. 89. 27. How doth he exceed
all other Monarchs and Potentates in the World?
<hi>Partly,</hi> for Largeness of Command and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
All Kings and Monarchs have certain Bounds
and Limits, by which their Empire is terminated;
but Christ is the true Catholick King, his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
runs throughout the whole Circuit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Providence; he hath Power over all
Flesh, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 2. yea, Devils themselves are to
stoop to him. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. Every Thing under
the Earth is to bow the Knee to Christ. <hi>Partly,</hi>
for the Excellency of his Throne. This King
hath a double Throne, one in Heaven, the other
in the Heart of an humble Sinner, which is his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47528:99"/>
second Heaven. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15. And in both these
respects there is no Monarch like Christ. <hi>He hath
prepared his Throne in the Heavens, and his Kingdom
ruleth over all.</hi> Psal. 103. 19. Earthly Kings, that
their Majesty may appear to their Subjects, have
their Thrones usually exalted; there were six
Steps to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Throne, a Description of it
you have in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 18, 19. But what's this
to the Throne of Christ, which God hath fix'd
above in the Heavens? The whole Globe of Sea
and Earth is but as one Point, and there are ten
thousand times ten thousands of Angels about his
Throne: The Supporters of this Throne are
<hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi> And in regard of his other
<hi>Throne</hi> also in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men: The Power
of outward Potentates reacheth but to the Bodies
of Men; they can take cognizance of nothing,
but of external Conformity to their Laws: But
Christ gives Laws to the <hi>Thoughts,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 5.
So for his Royal <hi>Furniture:</hi> Other Princes, they
have their Chariots, and Coaches, and Horses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but <hi>He makes the Clouds his Chariot, and walketh
upon the Wings of the Wind,</hi> Psal. 104. 3. Riding
up and down in the World, dispensing Mercies
and Judgments. So for <hi>Troops</hi> and <hi>Armies</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
his Dignity, all the Hosts of Heaven are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to him; one Angel in one Night destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army, an Hundred Fourscore
and Five Thousand. Hostility against him must
needs be deadly. He is above in Heaven, and
can rain down Fire and Brimstone upon us, and
cannot be resisted. He is higher than the Kings
of the Earth too, because none hath so good a
<hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to rule, as this King hath, whom
God hath set upon his holy Hill of <hi>Sion.</hi> God's
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47528:100"/>
Dominion over the Creatures is founded in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Other Kings <hi>find</hi> their Subjects; he <hi>makes</hi>
them. He hath the first and chief Right; there
is nothing we have, but he made. We depend
upon him every moment for his providential As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance;
therefore he hath the highest Right and
Title: No Creature can be <hi>sui juris,</hi> at his own
dispose. And he hath a Right by <hi>Conquest,</hi> and
by <hi>Purchase;</hi> he hath bought us, and given his
<hi>Life a Ransom for many.</hi> Mat. 20. 28. Christ is
opposed there to worldly Potentates; they must
be served, but he came to minister: Subjects,
their Blood and Lives must go to preserve the
Rights of the Prince; but he gave his Life. And
he hath a Right too by <hi>Contract</hi> and <hi>Covenant.</hi>
All that are Subjects of his Kingdom, have sworn
Allegiance. He hath such an absolute Right, that
thou canst call nothing thy own. We think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
our Lips are our own, <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. 4. and our
Estates our own: as <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 11. <hi>Shall
I take my Bread, and my Water, and my Flesh?</hi> &amp;c.
All you have, it belongeth to this King, by Right
of Creation, and Providence. Therefore in all
these respects he is higher than the Kings of the
Earth.</p>
               <p>2. The Gospel-State is set forth as a Kingdom,
in regard of the Subjects, and their <hi>Privileges:</hi>
The <hi>Gospel</hi> doth not only reveal a King, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
all Kings: <hi>He hath made us to be Kings and
Priests,</hi> &amp;c. Rev. 1. 5. All those that submit to
him. So that indeed Christ may properly be sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Rex Regum,</hi> King of Kings. As the King of
<hi>Assyria</hi> made his Boast, <hi>Isa. 10. 8. Are not my
Princes altogether Kings?</hi> A vaunting Speech of
his, that his Princes and Favourites were for
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47528:100"/>
Power and Authority as good as Kings. But
Christ may say so; Are not my Subjects altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kings? not only Kings in regard of their
<hi>spiritual Power</hi> and Command they have over
<hi>themselves,</hi> ruling their own Spirits in the Fear of
God, while others are Slaves to their base Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
but in point of their <hi>Privileges:</hi> They
have Kingly Privileges, they are made Kings;
they are royally attended by Angels, they are sent
forth to be as Guardians to the Heirs of Promise,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. They have Royal Immunities, from
the Curse of the Law, from the damnable Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Sin; they may as well pluck Christ from
the <hi>Throne,</hi> as pluck the Elect out of that State
wherein they are. As <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>Is it a small
thing to be the King's Son in Law?</hi> So, is it a small
thing to be the Sons of God, Coheirs with Christ?
This Honour and Glory doth God put upon his
Saints. And there's the greatest Pleasure and
Contentment in this State; for this Kingdom,
which all the Saints are interested in, it consisteth
in <hi>Righteousness, Peace, and Ioy in the Holy-Ghost.
Rom.</hi> 14. 17. And surely these Consolations of
God should not be small to us. It is a State of most
absolute Freedom and Sovereignty; <hi>Iohn 8. 36.
If the Son shall make you free, then shall ye be free
indeed.</hi> Many a Monarch which ruleth over Men,
may be a Captive to his own Lusts; but these are
free. There are the richest Revenues and Increase,
which belong to Christ's Subjects: <hi>All Things are
yours,</hi> (1 Cor. 3. 21.) <hi>whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollos, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
They are ours by Covenant, and when they come
into our possession, (by the fair Allowance of
God's Providence) we have them with a Blessing,
and may use them with a great deal of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:47528:101"/>
3. In regard of the Laws, and Manner of
Administration. I shall not speak of the External,
Political Government of the Church, (which
questionless is <hi>Monarchical,</hi> I mean in regard of
Christ the Head; tho it be <hi>Aristocratical,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of Officers, and (in some respect) <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical,</hi>
with reference to the Consent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in all Church-Acts) but there are Laws and
Sanctions, by which this Body of Men, and this
Kingdom is governed. <hi>Iames 2. 8. If ye fulfill
the Royal Law.</hi> It is called the <hi>Royal Law,</hi> not
only as it requires <hi>noble Work,</hi> but in regard of
the <hi>Dignity of the Author,</hi> and <hi>Firmness of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation:</hi>
All the Precepts of Faith, Repentance,
and Gospel-walking, are as so many Royal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts,
which Christ hath set forth, to signify his
Pleasure to his People. How slightly soever we
think of these Gospel-Injunctions, they are the
Laws and Instructions of the great King.</p>
               <p>4. In regard of <hi>Punishments</hi> and <hi>Rewards.</hi> Christ,
who is a King by nature, might rule us with a Rod
of Iron; yet he is pleased to govern us as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Prince, that he might cast the Bands of
a Man upon us. Christ, as a King, <hi>punisheth;</hi>
and as a King, <hi>rewardeth.</hi> Prov. 16. 14. <hi>The Wrath
of a King is as Messengers of Death.</hi> When a King
is angry, 'tis as if a Messenger should come and
tell us, we must die. How great is the Wrath
of the King of Kings! He cannot endure to be
slighted in his Regal Power. <hi>Luke 19. 27. But
those mine Enemies, which would not that I should
reign over them, bring them hither, and slay them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me.</hi> Christ himself will see Execution done
in his own sight and presence, upon those Rebels
that will not submit to his Rule and Government.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47528:101"/>
How should the Hearts of wicked Men tremble,
which have violated the Laws of Christ, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
his Authority, when they consider how
odious this is, how certainly Christ will see Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
done upon them! When <hi>Adonijah</hi> and his
Guests heard of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s sitting upon his Throne,
and the Shouts and Acclamations of Joy and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,
they were stricken with Fear, and fled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one several ways. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 49. You that
cherish your Lusts, which stand out against the
Sovereignty of Christ, that will not let him rule
over you, whose Hearts say, (tho their Tongues
dare not) <hi>We will not have this Man to reign over
us;</hi> you that seem to put him by his Kingdom,
he is furnished with absolute and irresistible Power
to destroy you, and will one day come and say,
Bring forth these Drunkards, Worldlings, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous,
that would not I should reign over
them; those that durst venture upon known Sin,
against the Checks of their own Conscience: how
will their Hearts tremble in the last Day, at the
Shouts and Acclamations of the Saints, when they
shall welcome this great King, when he shall come
forth in all his Royalty and Sovereignty? And as
for <hi>Punishment</hi> Christ will shew himself as a King,
so for <hi>Rewards.</hi> Kings do not give Trifles. <hi>Arau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah
gave like a King to a King,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 23. He
was of the Blood-Royal of the <hi>Iebusites,</hi> and he
gave worthy of his Extraction: And so Christ
will give like a King. God propounds nothing
that was cheap and unworthy, but <hi>He gives you a
Kingdom,</hi> Luke 12. 32. The Poor of this World
are <hi>Heirs of a Kingdom,</hi> the fairest Kingdom that
ever was, or ever will be; as poor and as despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
as now they are, yet they shall have a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47528:102"/>
What can you wish for and desire, more
than a Kingdom? All shall reign with Christ
for evermore. Which shews the Folly of carnal
Men, that will hazard so great, and so blessed
Hopes. Thus I have shewn you, why the Gospel-State
is compared to a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Now let me tell you, it is a spiritual Kingdom,
not such as comes with Observation. Jesus
Christ, when he was inaugurated into the Throne,
when he was to sit down at God's right-hand,
how doth he manifest it? He gives Gifts, as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
use to do at their Coronation, but they are
spiritual Gifts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. And he sent abroad
Embassadors, poor Fishermen, they and their
Successors, to go and treat with the World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 19. Indeed they had a mighty Power with
them, as becoming such a great King, as was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Vail of Meanness and Weakness, it was
carried on in a spiritual manner. And still he
doth administer his Kingdom, not by Force; he
rules not by the Power of the Sword, but by his
Word and Spirit, so he governeth his People.
The Publication of the Gospel is a <hi>sending forth
the Rod of his Strength,</hi> Psal. 110. 2. And the
Holy-Ghost, as Christ's Viceroy, he governeth
them, and administreth all things that are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to his Kingdom; he doth it by the Holy-Ghost,
as his Deputy. The Father chuseth a
sort of Men, gives them to Christ; the Son dieth
for them, that they may be Subjects of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and he commits them to be governed and
ruled by the Holy-Ghost: He useth the Ministry
of Men, and so unites them to Christ; and Christ
brings them to the Father, by his Intercession
committing them to his Care and Love; and by a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47528:103"/>
final Tradition at last, which is the last Act of
Christ's Mediatorial Kingdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. he
shall deliver them up to the Father. The Spirit,
blessing the Ministry of Men, works Faith, by
which we are united to Christ; and Christ inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
for us, and will bring us to God again. And
in this spiritual manner is this Kingdom carried
on. So that if we would enter into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
we must go to God the Father, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
we are Rebels and Traitors, but desire he
would not enter into Judgment with us, but seek
to be reconciled to God the Father. Now as
God bade the Friends of <hi>Iob</hi> to go to <hi>Iob,</hi> chap.
42. 8. So God sends us to Christ, in whom alone
he is well-pleased with the Creature: If we go
to the Son, he refers us to the Spirit, to be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from our Impurity and Rebellion. If we go
to the Spirit, he refers us to <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Pastors and Teachers; there we shall hear
of him in Christ's way, and there we feel the
Rod of Christ's Strength, the Efficacy of his
Grace put into our Hearts.</p>
               <p>Thus are we brought into his Kingdom, and
made to be a mystical Body, and spiritual Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in whom Christ rules; and there we come to
enjoy those Freedoms I spake of; and our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to this Kingdom is carried on in a spiritual
manner. In <hi>Worship,</hi> we give our Homage to
God; in the <hi>Word,</hi> we come to learn his Laws;
in the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> we renew our Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to this King; in <hi>Alms</hi> and Charity, we pay
him Tribute; in <hi>Prayer,</hi> we ask his Leave, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
his Dominion; and <hi>Praise,</hi> it is
our Rent to the great Lord, from whom we hold
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47528:104"/>
all things. And thus is Christ's Kingdom carried
on in a spiritual manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1. The Use is, to press you to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Kingdom. Consider what God hath prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
to draw you off from your carnal Delights,
and sinful Pleasures: No less than a Kingdom
to bear you out, to call you off from your Sins.
O do not answer, as the Olive-Tree and the Vine
in <hi>Iotham</hi>'s Parable, <hi>Iudg. 9. 9. Shall I leave my
Fatness, and go to be promoted over the Trees?</hi> God
comes to a Worldling, and makes him a Proffer
of this blessed State, which is represented by a
Kingdom, Shall I leave all my Sports, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Hopes? (according as the Man is affected)
Shall I renounce my Pleasures? live a strict and
austere Life? Must I leave off Projects, saith a
Worldling, and depend upon the Reversion of
Heaven? O consider it is for a glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Men will do much for an Earthly Crown,
tho lin'd with Cares, for this Golden Ball, which
all hunt after, and doth occasion so many Stirs in
the World. Turn your Ambition this way, you
may aspire to a Crown, to the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
without the Crime of Treason; this is a
faithful Ambition: It is indeed Treason against
the Kingdom of Heaven, not to look after this
Crown, and plot, contrive, and act, and offer
violence for the obtaining of it. And therefore
come under this Kingdom; if you do not, you
will be left under the Power of a worse. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
12. 8. God saith, he would give them up to the
King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> why? <hi>They shall be his Servants,
that they may know my Service, and the Service of
the Kingdoms of the Countries:</hi> That they might
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47528:104"/>
see what difference there is between serving God,
and serving others. If you refuse God's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you are under a worse, under Sin, and the
Power of Darkness; you are under your own
Lusts; nay, (and by a just Judgment) God may
give you over to live in Bondage to unmerciful
Men. How many Kings and Lords doth he serve,
that will not serve one Lord? O therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
those other Lords that have Dominion
over you, and come under this Kingdom which
God hath set up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2. To press the Children of God,</p>
               <p>1. To walk worthy of the Gospel; it is a
Kingdom. The Apostle hath an Exhortation
and Charge to this purpose, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 11, 12.
<hi>That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called
you unto his Kingdom and Glory.</hi> Walk in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Christ, that's one thing. Christ is a King
by a natural Right; God hath chosen him, God
hath set him upon his holy Hill: <hi>The Lord hath
made him to be Head over all Things.</hi> Ephes. 1. 22.
Nay, the Church chuseth Christ: <hi>They shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
to themselves one Head.</hi> Hos. 1. 11. And
therefore for you that are called to his Kingdom
and Glory, that have entred into Covenant with
Christ, that have subscribed to him as Head and
King; for you to be disobedient, give way to Sin,
it is worse in you. <hi>Will ye go away also?</hi> saith
Christ to his Disciples. Christ hath a Right to
reign over wicked Men; but you have actually
chosen him. Treason is less culpable in those
which have not submitted to a Power and Prince,
and owned him for their King, than in those
that have sworn Faith and Allegiance. You have
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47528:105"/>
passed under the Bond of the holy Oath; <hi>God
hath called you to his Kingdom and Glory;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you should be more obedient, than to allow
a disloyal Thought, or rebellious Lust against
Christ.</p>
               <p>2. As you should be more holy, wary, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that you do not break the Laws of Christ,
for you have consented to him; so live as Kings,
exercising all Acts of Regality within your own
Souls, ruling your own Spirits, exercising Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over your own Hearts, and over every Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
that will not be bridled. It is a Disgrace
to the Regal Estate of the Gospel, for you to be
over-mastered by a Lust, to lie under the Power
of any Sin; yet thus it is, God's Children are
conflicting with one Sin or other more than the
rest. So far you have not experience of that
Truth, <hi>Iohn 8. 32. And ye shall know the Truth,
and the Truth shall make you free.</hi> A Man that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in Bondage to his Lusts, how can he chuse
but doubt of those glorious Privileges? Have
you found the State of the Gospel to be a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
do you walk worthy of the Gospel?</p>
               <p>3. It teacheth us Contempt of the World, and
earthly Things. <hi>Phil. 3. 14. I press toward the
Mark, for the Prize of the high Calling of God in
Iesus Christ.</hi> It is not for Princes to embrace a
Dunghil, nor for Eagles to catch Flies. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
thou wilt one day be a King with God in
Glory, and therefore shouldst not be as low and
base as the Men of the World are, but walk
worthy of God, who hath called you to a Royal
State.</p>
               <p>4. A generous Confidence in the midst of the
Troubles and Abasements of the World. What
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47528:105"/>
tho you be accounted as the Scurf and Off-scouring
of all Things? tho your outward Condition be
low and mean, know the Worth of your high
Calling in Christ. How poor and despicable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you are in this World, yet you are Heirs of
a Crown and Kingdom. Therefore remember
you are Princes, that walk up and down in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
in a foreign Country. If you are kept in a
mean Condition, it is but a Disguise God hath put
upon you. We are the Sons of God, tho for the
present it doth not appear what we shall be. God's
Heirs make little shew in the World. But there
is a high Dignity, a mighty Privilege put upon
you; you are called to be Heirs of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and this blessed and Royal Estate, which
God hath provided for them that love him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Are we translated into this Kingdom?
Col. 1. 13. <hi>He hath delivered us out of the Power of
Darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of his
dear Son.</hi> Every Man naturally is under other
Lords, the Devil hath Dominion over him, and
he is under the Government of his own Lusts;
but now, are we translated into the Kingdom of
Christ?</p>
               <p>The Second Point is,</p>
               <p>Doct. 2. <hi>All those that are affected with God's
Glory, should desire the coming of this Kingdom,
and seriously deal with God about it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None else can rescue and pluck them out of
the Power of Darkness, and deliver them from
the Thraldom of those other Lords that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47528:106"/>
hold them; and none else can defend and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them.</p>
               <p>I shall handle the Point,
<list>
                     <item>1. In a private,</item>
                     <item>2. In a publick Respect.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First; In a private respect. Every Man should
desire, that the Kingdom of God should come
down, and be set up in his own Heart. Here I
must repeat and apply the Distinctions of Christ's
Kingdom: He is to desire the Kingdom of Grace,
and the Kingdom of Glory may come to himself,
and others.</p>
               <p>I. The Kingdom of <hi>Grace,</hi> that it may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
continued, and encreased.</p>
               <p>First; That this Kingdom may be <hi>begun,</hi> and
a Throne erected for Christ in our Hearts. The
great Necessity of this Request will be evidenced
in these Considerations.</p>
               <p>1. That every Man by Nature is under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King, under the Kingdom of Sin and Satan.
Satan is the Monarch, and Sin is the Scepter.
Christ and the Devil divide the World; either
we belong to the one, or the other. Now the
Devil, by reason of the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> he hath
the Start of Christ; and the Lord Jesus coming
to possess the Heart, doth not seize upon it as a
Waste which belongeth to the next Occupier, but
he seizeth upon it as already possessed by Satan.
The Devil quietly ruleth in the Hearts of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate,
he <hi>keeps House, and all the Goods are
in Peace.</hi> Luke. 11. 21. And therefore wicked
Spirits are called, <hi>The Rulers of the Darkness of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47528:106"/>
this World,</hi> Eph. 6. 12. All the ignorant and
carnal part of the World falls to his share, and
he doth not easily quit possession. Christ indeed
employeth Men to wrestle with Principalities and
Powers. The Work of the Ministry is to shake
and batter the Empire of the Devil. You must
be turned, you must be rescued. You must be
turned: <hi>Acts 26. 18. To turn them from the Power
of Satan unto God.</hi> You must be rescued, and
plucked out of this Captivity by strong hand.
Col. 1. 13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the Power of
Satan;</hi> who hath taken us out of Darkness by a
powerful Rescue. Even as the <hi>Israelites</hi> were
brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by a <hi>strong Hand, and
stretched-out Arm;</hi> so are we brought out of the
Power of Darkness. By such an irresistible
Power of Grace must God recover you, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Men yield themselves up to his Scepter. Look
as the Spirit of God works holy Motions, and
gracious Desires in the Hearts of God's Children:
So the Devil is <hi>at work in the Children of Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi>
Eph. 2. 2. framing wicked Devices,
carnal Desires, evil Thoughts against God. Man
is such a perfect Slave to the Devil, that he can
do nothing but sin.</p>
               <p>2. This Kingdom which Satan exerciseth, is
an invisible Kingdom. The Devil doth not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
appear to his Vassals and Slaves. When
Christ's Kingdom and Regiment was more exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
so was the Devil's also: As when God was
served by Sacrifices, and delivered his Mind by
Oracles; so Men did then more professedly own
the Devil, by observing his prescribed Rites of
Worship, and by being deluded by lying Oracles,
and Answers to their Prayers and Ques<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ions.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:47528:107"/>
But now since the Kingdom of Christ is more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
and managed by the Holy-Ghost in the
Hearts of his Saints; so is Satan's Kingdom invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
So that Men may be Christ's Subjects by
external Profession, and the Devil's by internal
Obedience, and Constitution of Mind, tho they
worship not by Pagan Rites, as he ruleth in their
Hearts, and takes them off from obeying the
Gospel they profess. <hi>The God of this World hath
blinded their Eyes,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. All carnal Men,
however they defy Satan, and abominate the
thoughts of serving him, yet while they remain
in their Sin and Ignorance, they still hold the
Crown upon the Devil's Head. Look as God's
Subjects may own him in verbal pretence, yet
<hi>their Hearts may be far from him,</hi> Mat. 15. 8. So
that wicked Men may defy the Devil in pretence
and words, and cannot endure to hear of him;
but they are under the God of this World, he
hath blinded their Hearts. So that this Kingdom
is to be sought for in the Heart. Christ made a
great Inroad upon the Devil, beat him out of his
Quarters: Yet, as the Sea gets in one place what
it loseth in another; so, tho the Devil hath lost
Ground in the Christian World, as to external
Profession, whilst People renounce the Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Gentiles, yet still he gets Ground in
the Hearts of wicked Men by their carnal Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions;
his Empire is upheld still, tho professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they are Subjects of Christ.</p>
               <p>3. Until Satan be cast out of the Throne,
Christ can have no Entertainment in the Heart.
The Ark and <hi>Dagon</hi> cannot sink and stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
either the Ark must be removed, or <hi>Dagon</hi>
will down upon his Face. So 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 14. What
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47528:107"/>
Communion hath Christ with Belial, and Light with
Darkness?</hi> It is impossible both Kingdoms can
stand together, or both Kings be set up in the
same Heart. The Marriage-Bed will admit no
Partner, nor Rival. A Man must be under
Christ or Satan. Until he be cast out, Christ
hath no room to be entertained. <hi>Mat. 6. 24. No
Man can serve two Masters: Ye cannot serve God
and Mammon.</hi> Look upon the Devil under that
Notion, as he is <hi>Mammon,</hi> as he doth entice to
Worldliness, it is impossible to serve him and
Christ. Both Masters have Work enough for
their Servants, and their Commands are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
If two Masters consent to employ one Man
in the self-same Business, tho they are two Men,
yet they are but one Master. But now to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Wills of Men which differ in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and which have a several and full Interest in
our Labours and Actions, it is as impossible, as to
move two contrary ways at once. Well then,
Mammon and Christ, Belial and Christ divide the
World. It is impossible to be under Belial and
Christ; both have full Work for us to do, and
their Designs are contrary: So that either it
must appear we have changed Masters, or we are
under the Power of the Devil still. We must
come out of the Power of Darkness, else we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be brought into the Kingdom of the Lord
Jesus, that we may obtain Remission of Sins.</p>
               <p>4. Satan may be cast out in part, and yet still
retain a supreme Interest in the Heart. I prove
it out of that Parable, <hi>Mat. 12. 43, 44, 45. When
the unclean Spirit is gone out of a Man, he walketh
through dry Places, seeking Rest, but findeth none.
Then he saith, I will return into my House, from
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:47528:108"/>
whence I came out,</hi> &amp;c. Out of that Parable we may
plainly conclude, there may be a shaking of Satan's
Empire, Satan may be cast out of a Man in some
sort, yet the Man not plainly renewed. Well,
how may he be cast out, and yet his Empire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unbroken? He may be cast out, <hi>partly,</hi> by
Conviction and Illumination; yet as long as any
Lust remaineth there unmortified and unsubdued,
he still keeps his Sovereignty in the Heart. Many
begin to be troubled, and to be thoughtful about
Eternity, that see better, yet they do that which
is worse in the Issue. When there's a Conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Corruption and Conviction, Corruption
carrieth it away. As Iron oft heated, and oft
quenched, is so much the harder: So, when they
had some Wamblings of Conscience, and the
Heart begins to boggle, and after this, Sin breaks
out the more. This is the Scope of that place:
They were convinced of a better Estate, and had
some thoughts of the Messiah, but did not give
him entertainment. <hi>Again,</hi> the Devil may be
cast out, in regard of some external Reformation.
A Man may a little wash his polluted Life, and
abstain from gross Sins, yet Satan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> have full pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the inner Man. A Man may abjure his
former ill Life, and for a while carry it fair, but
afterwards retain his former Filthiness, and keep
a secret League with his Lusts, and so he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
again, <hi>and then his latter End is worse than
his Beginning;</hi> and as it is in 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 22. The
Dog is turned to his own Vomit again, and the Sow
that was washed, to her wallowing in the Mire.</hi> A
Prisoner which hath made some Escape, if ever
the Goaler get him into his Clutches, is sure to be
loaden with Irons: So one that hath had some
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47528:108"/>
partial Reformation, O when the Devil gets
such a Man into his power again, he is ten times
worse than he was before.</p>
               <p>5. The Difficulty of casting off the Sovereignty
of Satan, lieth partly in our selves, and partly
in the Devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partly, in our selves.</hi> As in the <hi>Israelites</hi> going
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the difficulty lay, not only in gaining
the Consent of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> (for he pursues after
them when they were gone) but also in persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the People to give their Consent; it was long
ere <hi>Israel</hi> desired to be gone: So in our natural
Condition, the Mind of Man is so depraved, that
he thinks his Bondage to be his Freedom, and that
there is no such merry Life, as to wallow in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Satisfactions; and our Affections are so far
engaged to this sinful Estate, that we dote upon
our Shackles, and are unwilling to hear of a
Change. The first Step of coming out of this
Kingdom of Darkness, is, when we find it to be
a heavy Burthen, and grow weary of the Devil's
Government, tho it be but out of a Principle of
Self-love. <hi>Isa. 26. 13. O Lord, other Lords besides thee
have had dominion over us; but by thee only will we make
mention of thy Name.</hi> Yea, but as soon as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to have any serious thoughts of that miserable
State in which we are, Satan interposeth, dealing
with us, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did with the <hi>Israelites.</hi> The
<hi>Israelites</hi> complain their Bondage was very sore;
what doth <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> He doubles the Burthen.
Exod. 5. 17. <hi>You are idle,</hi> &amp;c. So that out of
Bondage of Soul, they would not hearken to
<hi>Moses.</hi> Just so Satan deals with us: When Souls
begin to be serious, and to leave off fleshly and
worldly Lusts, and to give up themselves to God,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47528:109"/>
that they may be directed in the way of Holiness,
and obtain eternal Life, then he doubles our Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.
Corruptions are never more stirring, than
after some Conviction. <hi>Rom. 7. 9. When the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
came, Sin revived, and I died;</hi> not only
as to a deeper sense of the Guilt of it, but as to
its strugling for Life. The Bullock at the first
yoaking is most unruly; so we which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accustomed
to the Yoke, when we begin once to
take it upon us, there's a mighty backwardness.
Fire at first kindling makes abundance of Smoke;
so when Conviction is stirring, Corruption is
more exa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>perated. The Devil is very jealous of
the first Beam of Light which breaks into the
Heart, and of every Ordinance which conveys it;
therefore sets Corruptions at work, that it may
appear to be a vain hope of ever escaping his
Clutches: So Men are tired, and give over, and
think it is to no purpose. But if Light increases
to more Trouble, the Devil seeks to elude the
Importunity of it by delay; as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> put off
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> still by delay: Or else by
compromising and compounding the Business; as
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he saw the People would go, God
would have them go, then they shall not go far,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 28. So if Men will be thinking of Christ's
Service, and coming under his Government, they
shall go, but not far; they shall come and pray,
and come and hear now and then, and make a
general Profession, but not too far in Christ's
Quarters; he is afraid of that: Just as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
stood hucking still; They must go a good way
into the Wilderness, otherwise it should be an
Abomination to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> yet their <hi>little Ones
must stay.</hi> If People will not only hear and pray,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:47528:109"/>
but begin to reform and cleanse their Lives, yet
he must have a Pledg, some Lust, as a Nest-Egg,
left in the Heart, some darling Sin, that must
keep up the Devil's Empire. Then they must
<hi>leave their Herds,</hi> then <hi>leave their Flocks;</hi> no,
not a Hoof. Ah! how long is it, when we are
under this Power of Darkness, ere we are free,
and get rid of the Government of Satan!</p>
               <p>6. We can never be sure that Satan is wholly
cast out, until Christ be seriously received and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
as Lord and King, until he dwell and
rule in the Heart by Faith. Alas! there may
be some Brabble now and then between us and
our Sins, and some partial Dislikes; but until
you heartily consent to take another King, that
you will be governed and ordered by, you are not
his subjects, but remain in the same State. <hi>Iohn
1. 12. As many as received him, to them gave he
Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that
believe in his Name.</hi> We are Children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
before, under his Standard and Government;
but when we receive him, then we are under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
King, another Power: When we receive
what God offered, receive Christ as Lord and
King; when the whole Soul opens the Door to
Christ, that the King of Glory may come in, and
dwell with us, and reign over us; then is his
Kingdom set up. The first Offer of the Gospel,
is <hi>Christ as Prince and Saviour,</hi> Acts 5. 31. And
the main thing the Business sticks at, is Christ's
Regal Power. <hi>Luke 19. 14. We will not have this
Man to reign over us.</hi> Now when we receive him
with all our Hearts, and tho before we had but
mean thoughts of him, now he begins to be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to us, and with the dearest Embraces of our
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:47528:110"/>
Souls we entertain him; and with a willing Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
we give up our selves, not only by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of Dependance, to rest upon him for Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
with God, but by a willing Subjection to
obey him, and give up the Keys of the Heart,
and lay them at Christ's Feet; as <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 9.
16. <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> When
you desire nothing more, but that his Kingdom
might come, the King of Glory himself, than
that he might bring Righteousness, Peace, and
Joy in the Holy-Ghost; until then, you are not
entred into his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>7. Christ is not received and entertained as
Lord and King, but where his Laws are obeyed.
Col. 2. 6. <hi>As ye have therefore received Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
the Lord, so walk ye in him.</hi> If you receive
him as Lord and King, so also obey him. And,
<hi>Heb. 12. 28. We receiving a Kingdom which cannot
be moved, let us have Grace, whereby we may serve
God acceptably, with Reverence and godly Fear.</hi> In
this Prayer, first, we say, <hi>Thy Kingdom come;</hi>
and then presently we add, <hi>Thy Will be done.</hi> We
do but prattle over the Lord's Prayer, and say it
with our Lips only, until we are resolved to do
what God would have us to do; love and hate,
fear and rejoice, as God directs. Until we are
brought to this Frame, we do not in good earnest
say, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi> An earthly King <hi>will do
according to his Will,</hi> Dan. 11. 3. So Christ stands
upon his Will in his Law. If you have taken
God for your God, and Jesus Christ for your
King, then say, with <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 143. 10. <hi>Teach
me to do thy Will, for thou art my God.</hi> It is an
universal Maxime, <hi>His Servants you are, whom
you do obey.</hi> Where is your Obedience? If Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47528:110"/>
of Grace, <hi>Every Thought is brought in subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
2 Cor. 10. 5. You will watch not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
your irregular Actions, but every Thought
which lifts up it self against the Obedience of
Christ. There will be a greater Tenderness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, not to break any of the holy Laws which
belong to Christ's Government. Hereby you may
know whether you come under another King, <hi>Do
you fear a Commandment?</hi> That is the Description
of a good Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 13. It is not he that
feareth a Punishment, but he that feareth a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
when the Heart is brought under an
Awe of Christ's Laws: So that when a Man is
tempted to Sin, O I dare not, the Lord hath
commanded me the contrary; this is more than
if a flaming Sword stood in his way. When we
have such workings of Heart, when we are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to this and that Sin; so when we are doing
any Duty, tho irksom to Flesh and Blood, yet it
is the Will of my Lord, to whom I have entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given up my self in a way of Subjection. This
is a Sign you are brought under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>8. None can obey his Laws, but by the virtue
and power of his <hi>Spirit.</hi> The new Covenant, it
is not only a <hi>Law,</hi> but the <hi>Law of the Spirit of Life
which is in Christ;</hi> so it is called by the Apostle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. It is not a bare literal Command that
shall urge us to Duty, but it giveth strength and
efficacy to the Heart. Other Kings, they give
Laws, that Men may keep them by their <hi>own</hi>
Strength: But now Christ, he would be owned
as a King, not only in a way of <hi>Subjection,</hi> but
establish a constant <hi>Dependance:</hi> He is a King,
not only to <hi>require,</hi> but to <hi>give</hi> Repentance, <hi>Acts</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:47528:111"/>
5. 31. not only to make a Law, but to write and
work a sense of this new Govenant-Gift upon the
Heart. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. He doth not only set up his
Ordinances, Laws, Constitutions; but there is
Power goeth along with the Dispensation of this
Kingdom, and thereby we are fitted and enabled
to love, serve, and please God; and then are
we under the Kingdom of God, when we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the spiritual Power of it. It is not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to obey his Laws, but that we do it by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his Power and Spirit: <hi>The Kingdom of
God stands not in Word, but in Power.</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 20.
That we may both acknowledg his Authority,
and wait for his Strength. This is a true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
when we look for all from him, and serve
him in the strength of his own Grace.</p>
               <p>9. All those that act through the virtue and
power of his Spirit, they do unfeignedly seek
his Glory, and make Christ to be not only their
Principle, but their End: for having a new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
they have a new Tendency; acting in the
Power of the Spirit, their Hearts are carried out
to seek Christ's Interest, and Christ's Glory;
when they can say with the Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21.
<hi>To me to live, is Christ;</hi> when their whole Business
is to set up Christ. We set up our selves in the
room of Christ, if he be not at the end of all.
2 Thess. 1. 11, 12. <hi>That God might fulfill all the
good Pleasure of his Goodness, and the Work of Faith
with Power, and that Christ may be glorified in you.</hi>
If you have the Power of Christ's Kingdom, this
will be the immediate Result and Issue of it, that
Christ may be honoured and set up, not only as a
Law-giver, and Fountain of Grace, but as
the last End. If to us to live is Christ, then is
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:47528:111"/>
the Kingdom of God come into our Heart. For
this we pray, that the Lord would so break the
Yoke and Government of Satan, <hi>that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Lord Iesus into our Heart; that we may
come under the Awe of his Laws, and in the Power of
his Grace, may seek his Kingdom and Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude: All this Grace is offered to
you; if you refuse the Offer, your Condition is
worse than if it had never been tendred to you.
The Lord hath sent his Son to help you out of the
Power of the Devil, and bring you in Heart and
Life again to himself; if you refuse this, then,
<hi>This is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the
World, and Men love Darkness rather than Light.</hi>
John 3. 19. The Lord Jesus, when he comes in
flaming Fire to render Vengeance, it shall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them that do not obey his Government, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi>
1. 8. that did not acknowledg God to be their
Sovereign. There will be a sore Vengeance on
them which had the Gospel tendred, and this
wonderful Provision brought home to them, and
left to their Choice, and yet have turned their
Backs upon it.</p>
               <p>Secondly; We beg the <hi>Continuance</hi> of it, that
he would maintain this Kingdom in our Heart, and
preserve us in this State; for those which can call
God <hi>Father,</hi> are still to say, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi>
It is not enough to go to Christ to begin it, but
to carry it on, and to keep and <hi>preserve us unto his
heavenly Kingdom,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 18. That we may
not revolt to the Devil's Side, after we have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
God for our God, and so our latter End be
worse than our Beginning.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; We pray for the <hi>Increase</hi> of it, that
it may get ground more and more. There are
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47528:112"/>
some Reliques of the Kingdom of Darkness yet
left, and there is something wanting to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Grace; we are troubled and molested
still. Tho Sin doth not get the Throne, tho the
Regency of it is cast down, yet it is not cast out,
in regard of Inherence. <hi>Sin shall not have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over you;</hi> that is all we can hope for. <hi>Rom.</hi>
6. 14. We cannot hope for an Extinction of Sin,
but only that it shall not have Dominion. As the
Beasts in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 12, tho their Dominion was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, yet their Lives were prolonged for a
season and time. The Reign, Power, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of Sin is taken down, yet it continues,
for our Exercise and Molestation. Now we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
he might rule in us by his Grace, and that of
the Increase of his Government there may be no
End.</p>
               <p>II. For the Kingdom of <hi>Glory,</hi> which in this
private Consideration, (as it concerns each Person)
is to begin at Death. And when we desire the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Kingdom of Glory, we do two
things; we express our Readiness for it, or our
Desire after it.</p>
               <p>1. Our <hi>Readiness</hi> for it; at least, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is ready for us, if we were ready
for it; as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 5. God is
ready to judg, but we are not ready to be judged.
And therefore we read of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
prepared for us, and of Men prepared for
the Kingdom of Heaven. It is prepared for the
Saints, <hi>Mat. 25. 34. A Kingdom prepared for you,
from the Foundation of the World.</hi> And the Saints
prepared for it, <hi>Rom. 9. 23. Vessels of Mercy,
which he had afore prepared unto Glory.</hi> And this
is that which the Apostle <hi>gives thanks for unto the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47528:112"/>
Father, which hath made us meet to be Partakers of
the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> Col. 1. 12.
Before we come to Heaven, there is a Right to
Heaven; we are made meet, more mortified and
weaned from present Things, often in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God here, and so for ever with the
Lord hereafter. We are still to have our Eyes to
our Rest, and happy State, that we may be made
ready for it. We express our Readiness, or we
beg it.</p>
               <p>2. That we may express our <hi>Desires</hi> after the
Enjoyment of it. A Christian is to desire the
Company of Christ. <hi>Phil. 1. 23. I desire to be
dissolved, and to be with Christ:</hi> And he is to
<hi>hasten the coming of the Day of God.</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 12.</p>
               <p>Now because this cannot be but by our Death,
therefore here we may examine a Case or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Case</hi> 1. First, about longing for Death: Is it
lawful to desire Death? The Law doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forbid Acts, but Thoughts and Desires;
therefore is it lawful to long for Death?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Yes; but yet we are not anxiously to
long after it, till the time come; not to grow
weary of Life, our of Desperation and Tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somness
of the Cross, as <hi>Ionah</hi> did, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 3.
but in order to God's Glory, and Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Happiness. See more at large, <hi>Psal.
119. vers. 17. pag.</hi> 104.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Case</hi> 2. Secondly, Do all that have an Interest
in Christ desire to die? Is not Death terrible?
Certainly Death is terrible, both as a natural and
a penal Evil. As in it self, it is the Curse of the
Covenant; and as it depriveth us of Life, the
chiefest Blessing. Yet we should train up our
selves in an expectation of Death, we should
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47528:113"/>
look and long for it, that when the time is come,
we might be willing to give up our selves into the
hands of God. It is required of a Christian, that
he should not only be <hi>passive</hi> in his own Death, to
die in Peace; but <hi>active:</hi> How? to hasten his
Death? No; but to resign up himself willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the hands of God; that his Soul might
not be <hi>taken away,</hi> but <hi>given up,</hi> and commended
to God. We should be willing to be in the Arms
of Christ, to be there where he is, to behold his
Glory. If Christ had such a good-will to Men,
as that he longed to be with us, solacing his
Heart with the thought of it, before all Worlds,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 31. He was thinking of us, how he
should come down, and converse with Men: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we should not be so backward to go to Christ.
And therefore as <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Spirit revived, when he
saw the Chariots <hi>Ioseph</hi> sent to carry him into
<hi>Egypt;</hi> so our Hearts should be more chearful
and comfortable, when Death approacheth:
Especially since <hi>Death is ours,</hi> it is changed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we should be framing our selves to such a
temper of Heart by degrees, that we might be
ready.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For Reproof to those, that would be
glad in their Hearts if Christ's Kingdom would
never come. As to the Kingdom of Grace, in
the external Administration, they hate the Light,
and will not come to the Light, lest their Deeds
should be reproved, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 20. A wicked Man
is loth to be troubled. God's Witnesses are the
Worlds Torment: <hi>Rev. 11. 10. They tormented
them that dwelt on the Earth.</hi> A Man that is bodily
blind, would have a sit Guide; but these
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:47528:113"/>
wretchedly blind Sinners, nothing so troublesom
and hateful to them, as one that would lead them
to the Kingdom of God. And then as to <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Grace,</hi> when this Kingdom of Heaven breaks
in upon their Hearts, when any Light and Power
darts in, they seek to put it out, they <hi>resist the
Holy-Ghost,</hi> Acts 7. 51. and refuse his Call. And
for the Kingdom of <hi>Glory,</hi> they say, <hi>It is good to
be here;</hi> and would not change their Portion here,
for their Portion in Paradise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2. To exhort us to desire the Coming of
Christ's Kingdom to our selves. If you have
any Love to the Lord's Glory, or your own Good,
you should do it. Rev. 3. 20. <hi>Behold, I stand at
the Door, and knock: If any Man hear my Voice,
and open the Door, I will come in to him, and sup
with him, and he with me.</hi> Will you not open to
God, that hath the best Right? Will you not
set open the doors to the King of Glory? When
Christ comes to bring entertainment to you, to
sup with you. Again, all Men (will they, nill
they) are subject to Christ; either they must
come, and touch his Golden Scepter, or feel the
Bruises of his Iron Mace; they must own him as
King. <hi>Every Knee shall bow,</hi> Phil. 2. 10. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be more willing to have the Kingdom of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
come. Again, if God be not your King, you
will have a worse Master, every Sin, every Lust:
Tit. 3. 3. <hi>Serving divers Lusts and Pleasures.</hi> You
will be at the Beck of every Lust and carnal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the <hi>Devil</hi> will be your Master to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
for upon the refusal of Christ's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there's a Judicial Tradition, you are given
up to your own Hearts Lusts. <hi>Psal. 81. 12. Israel
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47528:114"/>
would none of me; so I gave them up to their own
Hearts Lusts, and they walked in their own Counsels.</hi>
And to <hi>Satan,</hi> to be insnared by him; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
26. <hi>Taken captive by him at his Will and Pleasure.</hi>
Not to <hi>buffet them,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> was, but to <hi>ensnare</hi>
and harden their Hearts. Again, if you be not
subject to God, you go about to make God sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to you in effect. You would have the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Glory, and yet continue in your Lusts.
Isa. 43. 24. <hi>Thou hast made me to serve with thy
Sins, thou hast wearied me with thine Iniquities.</hi>
When you would have God patient, hold his
hand, and be merciful to you, and yet would
continue in your Lusts, then you make God serve
with your Sins. Again, many temporal Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
will follow, if we do not give way to
the Kingdom of Christ to seize upon us; when
we make no difference between God's Service,
and the Service of other <hi>Lords,</hi> then he gives us
up to the Service of Men, to a foreign Enemy, to
an oppressive Magistrate, or breaks the Staff of
Government among Men, that we might know
what it is to be under his Service and Government.
Therefore give willing Entertainment to the
Kingdom of Christ.</p>
               <p>So much for the private Consideration of this
Request, <hi>Thy Kingdom come;</hi> that is, to us and
our Persons, both the Kingdom of Grace, and
the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Having spoken of the Kingdom
of Christ in a private, now I come to speak
of it in a publick Consideration: And that is
twofold:
<list>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:47528:114"/>
                     <item>1. The publick visible Administration of the
Kingdom of Grace.</item>
                     <item>2. The publick and solemn Administration of
the Kingdom of Glory, at the Day of Judgment,
when Enemies shall have their final Doom, and
Saints have their Crowns set upon their Heads, in
the sight of all the World.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I shall speak of both, but (because the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
may be more fresh and lively) upon other
Texts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The publick visible Administration of the
Kingdom of Grace, on <hi>Psal. 51. 18. Do good in
thy good pleasure unto</hi> Sion; <hi>build thou the Walls of
thy</hi> Jerusalem.</item>
                  <item>2. The Kingdom of Glory, on <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 20.
<hi>Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, Come Lord
Iesus.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>For the first. Tho the Church be never so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 102. 14. when all is defaced, as to
external appearance, lying in a ruinous Heap, yet
it is beloved and pitied by God's Servants: <hi>Thy
Servants take Pleasure in her Stones, and favour the
Dust thereof.</hi> There is nothing God's People de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
so much as <hi>Zion</hi>'s Welfare. <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 54.
<hi>That I may see the Good of thy Chosen, that I may
rejoyce in the Gladness of thy Nation, that I may
glory with thine Inheritance.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> in this
Psalm, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 18. having prayed for himself,
prayeth for Mercy to the Church and State: <hi>Do
good in thy good pleasure unto</hi> Zion, <hi>build thou the
Walls of thy</hi> Jerusalem. But how cometh <hi>David,</hi>
who was in the depth of private Humiliation,
so suddenly to fall upon the Case of the Church?
There was a special Reason for annexing this
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:47528:115"/>
Request to his own private Complaints and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions.
The Reasons will occasion so many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations.</p>
               <p>1. Because of the Offence, Scandal, and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
done to the Church by his Fall; and to
make amends, he prayeth the more earnestly,
Let not <hi>Zion</hi> fare the worse for my sake. From
thence observe, That the Sins of particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
oft bring a Mischief upon the whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<hi>David</hi> had made a Breach in the Walls of
God's Protection, and left them naked, and more
in danger of Judgment: <hi>Therefore do good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>David</hi> was not only a private Member, but
a Prince, and their Sins have a more universal
Influence. The Sins of Magistrates draw down
Judgments on their People, all smart for their
Miscarriages. <hi>Hezckia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>s Pride cost <hi>Israel</hi> dear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
2 Chron. 32. 25. <hi>Wrath was upon him, and upon</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah
<hi>and</hi> Jerusalem: It did not stay upon his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
As a great Oak cannnot fall, but all the
Shrubs about it suffer Loss. But,</p>
               <p>3. <hi>David</hi> having some comfortable Assurance
of the Pardon of his Sins, doth now seek Mercy
for the Church. From thence observe, That we
are never fit to pray for the Publick, till we have
made our Peace with God. As the Priests under
the Law offered Sacrifice, <hi>first, for their own Sins,
and then for the Peoples.</hi> Heb. 7. 27.</p>
               <p>4. Because being brought by such a solemn but
sad occasion into God's presence, he could not but
have some thoughts of <hi>Zion.</hi> And from thence
observe, That we should never come to God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any private occasion, but we should remember
the Publick. We are to pray in Love, as well
as Faith. Christ hath not taught us to say, <hi>My
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47528:115"/>
Father,</hi> but <hi>Our Father;</hi> to shew that we should
take in the Interests and Concernments of the
whole Body, that there may be a Spirit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
breathing in our Prayers. <hi>David</hi> doth
not only say, <hi>Have mercy upon me according to thy
Loving-kindness,</hi> but, <hi>Do good unto</hi> Zion <hi>in thy good
pleasure.</hi> Every living Member will be careful for
the Body. Members should be careful one for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
much more for the whole. Is any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
pained or grieved? all suffer: If the Toe be
trod upon, the Tongue complaineth, you have
hurt me; but now much more when all is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
Therefore we should not altogether
seek our own Things, but wrestle with God for
the Publick.</p>
               <p>1. This reproveth divers sorts of People. Some
are Enemies to the Publick Welfare, as Vipers
eat out the Dam's Belly, especially Enemies to
<hi>Zion; Down with it, down with it, even to the
Ground.</hi> What Monsters hath this Age brought
forth! Others are indifferent and careless which
goeth up, Christ or Antichrist; they only mind
the Matters of their own Interest and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>All seek their own Things.</hi> As to the
Publick Interest of the Church, let all go how it
will. Let me tell you, <hi>To be selfish, is a sort of
Self-Excommunication;</hi> you cast your selves out of
the Bundle of Life: And to be sensless, 'tis an
implicit renouncing the Body. Others there are
that are gracious, but full of discontent at some
Passages of Providence, and these seem to have
lost their publick Affections. 'Tis a sad Symptom,
when a praying People are discouraged from
praying for Publick Welfare. God is very tender
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47528:116"/>
of the Prayers of his People; he is loth they
should be lost, and sorry they cannot be granted.
We may sin in ceasing to pray. 'Tis a sad Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when the Hearts of God's People are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off from praying. Again, Those that pray
too coldly for the Publick, not as those that
would do their Work. There is a great Decay
of the Spirit of Prayer, which is also a sad Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.
But now to shew you,</p>
               <p>II. What we should pray for, for <hi>Zion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The Dilatation or Enlargement of it
throughout the World. The more ample God's
Heritage is, the more is his Glory known. <hi>Prov.
14. 28. In the Multitude of the People is the King's
Honour;</hi> and the Glory of a Shepherd lieth in
the Number of his Flock: So Christ's Kingdom,
the more it is enlarged, the more Honour God
hath. Psal. 67. 2. <hi>That thy Way may be known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Heathen, and thy Saving-Health among all
Nations.</hi> Especially when the Fulness of the
Gentiles is brought in, <hi>Psal.</hi> 54. 2. and when the
Jews are brought in, <hi>Hos.</hi> 3. 5. To be instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to enlarge Christ's Kingdom, 'tis an Honour
to us, to draw on Christ's triumphant Chariot,
let us be sure to have an hand in it. These Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
if sincere, are never in vain; if they profit
not others, they promote the Kingdom of God
in our selves.</p>
               <p>2. The Preservation and Defence of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
already planted, frustrating the Plots and
Power of the Enemies: <hi>That God would be a Wall
of Fire round about them,</hi> Zech. 2. 5. <hi>Qui commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
arccat, &amp; eminus terreat:</hi> When at the
weakest God can protect them, bridling by his
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47528:116"/>
secret Power the Rage of Adversaries, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating
their Attempts.</p>
               <p>3. For Comfort and Deliverance in Afflictions.
We should pity the distressed Church, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.)
That God would redeem them out of
all their Troubles. Every true Member of the
Church hath Life Christ; and that Life gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
Feeling; and that Feeling, Affection, and
Sympathy to rejoice and mourn. They that
mourn for <hi>Zion,</hi> rejoice with her. Isa. 66. 10.
<hi>Rejoice ye with</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and be glad with her, all
ye that love her; rejoice for Ioy with her, all ye that
mourn for her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. For the Furniture of the Church; a Supply
of all Good, internal and external.</p>
               <p>(1.) Internal: That God would bless them
with Ordinances, enrich them with Graces, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Truth and Unity, and continue his Presence
with them: his Ordinances, that they may enjoy
them in Purity; that the Word, Seals, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
may be rightly administred till the Lord
come. These are Things pertaining to the
Kingdom of God, concerning which Christ spake
to the Disciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 3. These are to be kept
till Christ's appearing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 14. 'Tis an
Honour to God, and of great Profit to the
Church, and a rejoycing to God's People, to see
them pure and unmixed. <hi>Tho absent in the Flesh,
yet I am with you in the Spirit, joying and beholding
your Order.</hi> Col. 2. 5. And then that God would
enrich them with his Presence: <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20.
<hi>Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
World.</hi> 'Tis God that giveth the Increase: <hi>Paul
may plant, and</hi> Apollos <hi>water; but God giveth the
Increase,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 6. for Conviction, Conversion,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47528:117"/>
Confirmation. 'Twas not the Ark, nor Mercy-Seat
covered with Cherubims, but the Answer
from between the Cherubims, given immediately
by God, that manifested his Presence. It is not
the Sound of the Gospel, or outward Ministry,
but the Work of his Spirit. <hi>Psal. 84. 2. My Soul
yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord; my
Heart and my Flesh crieth out for the Living God.</hi>
And, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 44. it is said, <hi>The Holy-Ghost fell
on all them which heard the Word.</hi> And then for
Unity: Christ hath callëd us into a Body, not
only into a Family, but into a Body. It was
Christ's own Prayer, <hi>Iohn 17. Let them be one.</hi>
Disputes will not heal, but Prayers may.</p>
               <p>(2.) For External Helps; we should pray,
that God would give us <hi>Pastors after his own Heart.</hi>
Mat. 9. ult. <hi>Pray ye the Lord of the Harvest, that
he would send forth Labourers into his Harvest:</hi>
Men that will discharge their Duty with all Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
Men whose Hearts are set to the Building
up of Christ's Kingdom, <hi>Labourers.</hi> And then
for Schools of Learning. A Man that hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Orchards, will also have Seminaries of young
Plants to maintain them. Schools are Seminaries,
without which the Church falleth to decay. And
then for good Magistrates, to patronize and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
Gods People, and promote his Work with
them. <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 23. there is a Promise, <hi>Kings shall
be thy Nursing-Fathers, and their Queens thy Nursing-Mothers,</hi>
&amp;c. Rest from Persecution is a great
Blessing: Acts 9. 31. <hi>Then had the Churches Rest,
and were edified, walking in the Fear of God, and
the Comforts of the Holy-Ghost, were multiplied.</hi> It
is a great Mercy that the Church hath any Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
These are the Things that we should pray
for, sor <hi>Zion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:47528:117"/>
Thus much shall suffice to be spoken of the
Kingdom of Christ in a publick Consideration,
with respect, first, to the publick visible Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Kingdom of Grace.</p>
               <p>I come now to speak of the second, <hi>viz.</hi> The
publick and solemn Administration of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Glory; and for that I shall insist on that
Portion of Scripture, <hi>Rev. 22. 20. Surely I come
quickly. Amen. Even so, Come, Lord Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you have,
<list>
                     <item>1. Christ's Proclamation.</item>
                     <item>2. The Churches Acclamation, in Answer
thereunto.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I. Christ's Proclamation, <hi>Surely I come quickly.</hi>
Where take notice of two Things:
<list>
                     <item>1. His Asseveration, <hi>Surely.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. His Assertion, <hi>I come quickly.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. His Asseveration, [<hi>Surely.</hi>] It is a certain
Truth, tho we do not so easily receive it. All
notable Truths, about which there is the greatest
Suspicion in the Heart of the Creature, you will
find them thus averred in Scripture; as, <hi>Isa.
53. 4. Surely he hath born our Griefs, and carried
our Sorrows.</hi> The dying of the Son of God is so
mysterious, that the Holy-Ghost propounds it
with a Note of Averment, <hi>Surely;</hi> that is, how
unlikely soever it seems, yet this is a certain Truth.
So here, the Coming of Christ is a thing so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so little regarded by Epicures and Atheists,
that it is propounded with a like Note of Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Surely I come quickly.</hi> Herein secretly is
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47528:118"/>
our Unbelief taxed, and also our Confidence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.</p>
               <p>2. You have his Assertion, <hi>I come quickly.</hi> Let
me explain what is meant by the Coming of
Christ. There is a twofold Coming of Christ, a
<hi>personal,</hi> and a <hi>virtual.</hi> Some think that the <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Coming</hi> is here meant, his Coming in the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> or in the Power of his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
to accomplish those Predictions. Here are
many things prophesied of, and behold, <hi>I come
quickly,</hi> you shall find these things presently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
upon the Stage of the World. So some
carry it. I think rather it is to be meant of his
<hi>personal Coming.</hi> There are two mystical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which do express all the Intercourse which
passeth between God and the Church in the
World, and they are both closed up with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of Chirst's coming. The <hi>Canticles</hi> is one,
which declareth the Communion and Intercourse
which is between Christ and his Church; and
you will find it thus closed up, <hi>Cant. 8. 14. Make
haste, my Beloved, and be thou like to a Roe, or to a
young Hart upon the Mountains of Spices.</hi> And so
here, in this <hi>Book of the Revelations,</hi> where are
the like Intercourses recorded, it is closed up with
this, <hi>Even so, Lord Iesus, come quickly.</hi> The
<hi>personal Coming,</hi> I suppose, is here meant. Now
Christ's <hi>personal Coming,</hi> it is but <hi>twofold,</hi> the
first, and the second; the Scripture knows of no
other Coming. <hi>Heb. 9. 28. He shall appear the
second time without Sin, unto Salvation.</hi> It is but a
fond Dream, to think of a personal Reign before
Christ's coming to Judgment; they reckon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out-book,
that look for any other. There was
his first Coming, which was to suffer; his second
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47528:118"/>
Coming is to reign; the first, his <hi>gracious,</hi> and
this his <hi>glorious Coming:</hi> The former is past,
and the latter is yet expected.</p>
               <p>[<hi>I come quickly;</hi>] How shall we make good
that?</p>
               <p>1. In general, Christ's Absence from the
Church, it is not long; tho you reflect upon the
whole Flux of Time, from his Ascension to his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Coming, it is but a Moment to Eternity;
some Hundreds of Years, that may be easily
counted.</p>
               <p>2. It is no longer than Need requires. The
High-Priest, when he was gotten within the Vail,
was to tarry there until his Ministration was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
until he had appeared before God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
himself for all the Tribes, then he was
to come out to bless the People. Jesus Christ
tarrieth within the Vail, but until all the Elect be
gathered. <hi>He is not slack,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9. but we are
hasty. Our Times are present with us, but we
must leave him to his own Time, to go and
come.</p>
               <p>3. Christ speaks this of the latter End of the
World, and then it will not be long. When
once he begins to set forth, the old Prophecies are
accomplishing apace; and how little preparation
soever there seems to be for this Work, it comes
apace. It is said of the Antichristian State, <hi>Her
Plagues shall come upon her in one day.</hi> Rev. 18. 8.
And of the Jews it is said, <hi>A Nation shall be born
at once.</hi> Isa. 66. 8. So much for the first part.</p>
               <p>II. Here is the Churches Acclamation, <hi>Amen.
So, Lord Iesus, come quickly.</hi> This Acclamation
is double:
<list>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:47528:119"/>
                     <item>1. Implicite, and infolded in the Word,
[<hi>Amen.</hi>]</item>
                     <item>2. Explicite, and unfolded; <hi>Even so, Lord
Iesus, come quickly.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. For the <hi>Implicite</hi> Acclamation of the Church,
in the Word <hi>Amen.</hi> The Word sometimes is
taken <hi>nominally,</hi> Rev. 3. 14. <hi>Thus saith the Amen,
the faithful and true Witness;</hi> He that is <hi>Amen,</hi> as
it is explained there, true and faithful, that will
certainly give a Being to his Promises. Sometimes
it is used <hi>adverbially,</hi> and translated, <hi>Verily:</hi> It
is either an affectionate Desire, <hi>Let it be;</hi> or a
great Asseveration, <hi>It shall be.</hi> It hath in it an
affectionate Desire: <hi>Ier.</hi> 28. 6. the Prophet said,
<hi>Amen, the Lord do so, the Lord perform thy
Words,</hi> &amp;c. When he had prophesied Peace to
the People, <hi>Amen, the Lord perform thy Words;</hi>
not to confirm the truth of his Prophecy, but to
express his own Wish, and hearty Desire, if it
might stand with the Will of God. Then it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
a firm Belief that it shall be done. Thus
Christ often saith, <hi>Amen, verily, verily I say unto
you,</hi> by way of strong Asseveration. Well then,
the Church expresseth her Faith and Desire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely:
<hi>Amen;</hi> Lord, that it were so; and
surely, Lord, it shall be so; we believe it, and
we desire it with all our Hearts.</p>
               <p>2. Explicitely; <hi>Even so, Lord Iesus, Come
quickly.</hi> From this latter Clause I might observe
many things.</p>
               <p>(1.) The sweet and blessed Harmony that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ and the Church. Christ's Voice, and
the Churches Voice, are Unisons. Christ saith,
<hi>I come;</hi> and the Church, like a quick Eccho,
takes the Word out of Christ's Mouth, <hi>Even so,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47528:120"/>
come.</hi> There is the same Spirit in Christ, and in
the Church; for it is his Spirit that resides with
us. Christ, he speaks in a way proper to him,
by way of Promise, <hi>I come;</hi> and the Church in
a way proper to her, by way of Prayer, <hi>Even so,
come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I might observe, That in the Close of the
World we should most earnestly desire Christ's
Coming. We have the Advantage of former
Times; to us Christ saith, <hi>I come quickly.</hi> Now
the set time almost is come, therefore our Pulses
should beat more strongly in putting up this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
to Christ. <hi>Tertullian</hi> shews, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians did pray, <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> mora finis,</hi> that
the End might not come too soon, Christ having
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s yet but a small Interest in the World, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
Enlargement upon Earth; but we have
more cause to look for the Accomplishment of
his Kingdom in Heaven. <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ey</hi> expected the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of Antichrist; and we expect the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Antichrist: <hi>They,</hi> that God might
be known in the World; <hi>we,</hi> that he might be no
longer dishonoured in the World. When great
Promises are near their Accomplishment, there is
a more lively Spirit stirring in the Hearts of the
Saints. <hi>Dan. 9. 2, 3. I understood by Books the
Number of the Years, whereof the Word of the Lord
came to</hi> Jeremiah <hi>the Prophet, that he would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
seventy Years in the Desolations of</hi> Jerusalem.
<hi>And I set my Face to the Lord God, to seek by
Prayer and Supplication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But quitting these Notes, I shall mainly insist
upon this Point, <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:47528:121"/>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That the Church, and all the faithful Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it, do really and heartily desire Christ's
second Coming.</p>
               <p>They look for it, they long for it, they wait
for it. They <hi>look for it:</hi> Phil. 3. 20. <hi>Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
is in Heaven, from whence also we look for
the Saviour, the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> They reckon
upon it, as <hi>Rebekah</hi> espied <hi>Isaac</hi> afar off. He is
gone within the Vail, he is appearing before God,
but he will come out again. When they see the
Clouds, upon these one day will our Saviour come.
Then they <hi>long</hi> for it. It is their Description,
2 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. They love his Appearing.</hi> Wicked
Men, and guilty Sinners hate and abhor it, he
being to come to them as a terrible Judg. Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
do not long for the Assizes. But now the
Saints, who are absolv'd, and washed in the
Blood of Christ, it doth them good to the Heart
to think of it, that one day Christ will appear in
all his Glory. And then they <hi>wait</hi> for it;
1 Thess. 1. 10. <hi>They wait for his Son from Heaven,
even Iesus, who hath delivered us from Wrath to
come.</hi> It is <hi>Wrath to come,</hi> something behind the
Coming of Christ, which makes it so terrible.
Hell makes the Day of Judgment terrible. The
Devil could not endure to hear of Christ's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
<hi>Mat. 8. 29. Art thou come to torment us?</hi> &amp;c.
So wicked Men have the Spirit of the Devil; it is
a Torment and Bondage to them, to think of the
Judges Coming. But those which have their
Discharge, they wait for it; it supports and
bears up their Hearts in the midst of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Afflictions, and they go on chearfully in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47528:121"/>
their Work, notwithstanding Lets and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p>To give some Reasons, why the faithful Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ so really and heartily desire
Christ's second Coming: They are of three
Sorts:
<list>
                     <item>1. Some in respect of the <hi>Person</hi> who is to
come.</item>
                     <item>2. Some in respect of the Persons which desire
his Coming.</item>
                     <item>3. Some in respect of the <hi>Coming</hi> it self.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I. In respect of him who is to come.</p>
               <p>1. His Person, that we may see him: The
Children of God have delighted to look upon him
through a Vail, and have had a king of Heaven
upon Earth, from beholding his Face in the Glass
of an Ordinance: Looking upon him in the
Vail of Ordinances, hath been a mighty Comfort
and Refreshing to them; now they would desire
to see his Person face to face. They know by
Hear-say, this great Redeemer and Saviour of
theirs; he wooeth them by Proxy. As <hi>Eleazar,
Abraham</hi>'s Servant, was to go abroad, and seek
for a Match for his Master's Son: So the great
Business of the Ministers of God, is to set forth
our Master's Son. Now the Saints would fain see
him. Nay, they have not only heard of him,
but believed in him, and received him into their
Hearts; nay, not only believed in him, but they
have loved him greatly: 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 8. Whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not seen, ye love; in whom, tho now ye see him
not, yet believing, ye rejoice with Ioy unspeakable,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47528:122"/>
and full of Glory.</hi> It hath been a ravishing thought
to them, to think of Christ. And they have
<hi>tasted:</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 3. <hi>If so be ye have tasted that the
Lord is gracious.</hi> And they have felt him in the
drawings of the Spirit, they live by his Life,
they have found a Virtue going out from him.
Now all that they desire is, that they may see this
great Person, who hath been their Redeemer and
Saviour.</p>
               <p>2. Consider him, as in his Person, so in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
to them. Here are two Titles, <hi>Even so,
Lord Iesus:</hi> He is <hi>Lord,</hi> and he is <hi>Iesus.</hi> He is
<hi>Lord,</hi> as a Master and Husband; as <hi>Sarah</hi> called
<hi>Abraham,</hi> Lord. As a <hi>Master:</hi> Good Servants
will look for their Master's coming, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 46.
And surely such a Master should be longed for,
and looked for; for when he comes, he will not
come empty-handed: <hi>Behold, I come quickly, and
my Reward is with me.</hi> Rev. 22. 12. Here Christ's
Servants have their Vales, but not their Wages:
Here they have present Maintenance, that is all
they have now; but then they shall have their
Reward and Wages; here they have their Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
but then they shall have the full Sum. Under
the Law, Masters were charged severely not to
defraud their Servants of their Hire; why? He
hath <hi>lift up his Soul to him;</hi> (that is) in the
middle of his hard Labours, this was his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
when the Work of the Day was over, he
should have his Wages and his Hire at Night. So
you have lift up your Souls to him, the great Pay-Day
will come, and this hath born you up in all
your Labours, and Travel of your Soul. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as he is our Lord, so we should look for him.
And then as our <hi>Husband;</hi> this is a sweeter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47528:122"/>
                  <hi>The Bride saith, Come,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. We
are here contracted and betrothed to Christ; <hi>I
will betroth thee to me,</hi> Hos. 2. 19. But the Day of
solemn Espousals is hereafter. Here we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed
to Christ in the Covenant of Grace;
Christ hath taken a Token from us, and left a
Token with us: He hath taken humane Flesh,
carried our Nature to Heaven, that he might be
mindful of us; and hath left the Spirit with us.
Now there will be a longing, looking, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for this Day of Solemn Espousals. And as he
is Lord, so he is Jesus, a Saviour. With what
melting Wishes doth the Captive long for a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and Redeemer! Now <hi>we look for a Saviour
from Heaven.</hi> Christ is a Saviour now, but not a
perfect Saviour to the uttermost, never till then:
Therefore the Day of Judgment is called the <hi>Day
of Redemption,</hi> Eph. 4. 30. There is something
left, that every Coming of Christ might bring
some Benefit; something of Misery left upon us
to the last Day. Here we have Enemies within
and without. <hi>Within,</hi> mighty Lusts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Coming is <hi>like a Refiner's Fire,</hi> Mal. 3. 2.
and <hi>Fullers Sope.</hi> His first and second Coming
we find oft in the Old Testament put together.
His Coming is, <hi>to present us holy, without spot and
blemish.</hi> Eph. 5. 27. Our present State is but a
Convalescency, a Recovery out of Sickness by
degrees; there is some Fruit of Sin left upon
the Body, until the Day of the general Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
that we may have new Matter of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
God, just as we are entring into Heaven.
Therefore that every Coming of Christ might
bring us a new Benefit, the Body is to die; the
old <hi>Adam</hi> is not quite abolished, until God be All
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47528:123"/>
in All. And so for Enemies <hi>without</hi> us: Here
we dwell among wicked Men, whose Sins are a
Grievance to us, and whose Injuries are a very
great Molestation and Trouble: We live here,
like <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom; His righteous Soul was vexed
with their ungodly Deeds,</hi> their filthy Conversation.
But then there will be a perfect Separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Sheep and the Goats. Here we are
exposed to many Persecutions; here Antichrist
is but consuming, there he shall totally and utterly
be abolished.</p>
               <p>II. If we respect the <hi>Persons</hi> desiring this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there is something in them to move them
to it. There is,
<list>
                     <item>1. The Spirit of Christ.</item>
                     <item>2. Certain Graces, which do necessarily issue
themselves into this Work.</item>
                     <item>3. Certain Experiences they have, which put
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m upon this longing.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. There's the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ: <hi>The Spirit
and the Bride saith, Come.</hi> Rev. 22. 17. The
Holy-Ghost breedeth this Desire in the
Church. Nature saith, It is good to be here;
but this is a Disposition above Nature, the Spirit
in the Bride. The Flesh and corrupt Nature
saith, <hi>Depart;</hi> but the Spirit saith, <hi>Come.</hi> The
great Work of the Spirit is, to bring us and
Christ together; he comes from the Father, and
the Son, to bring us to the Father by the Son. All
he doth, is to bring Christ and the Spouse toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
therefore he enkindleth in the Hearts of
God's People, a strong and earnest desire of his
Coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:47528:123"/>
2. There are <hi>Graces</hi> planted in us; Faith,
Hope, Love, Zeal. <hi>Faith,</hi> that is the ground of
this Desire. Christ saith, <hi>he comes quickly;</hi> and
this provokes and draws up the Desire, to believe
Christ will be as good as his Word. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 2, 3.
<hi>I go to my Father, and will come again to receive you
to my self.</hi> Christ hath ever been plain-hearted
with us: he saith, <hi>I come;</hi> and the Church saith,
<hi>Amen,</hi> in a way of Faith, <hi>Even so, come.</hi> If
Christ had gone away in discontent, and with a
Threatning in his Mouth, that we should never
have seen his Face more, then we could have had
but cold Hopes, and faint Desires; but he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Love, and left a Promise with us. The
Church, and the believing Soul saith, <hi>I have his
Word for it:</hi> He hath ever been punctual hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and kept his Word to a tittle, and hath said,
<hi>I will come again.</hi> This upholdeth the Hearts of
Believers during his Absence: For they reason
thus; What need had Christ to flatter or deceive
us, or promise more than he will perform?
Would we flatter a Worm, that we can easily
crush? He can strike us dead, if we do not
please him; He hath been true in all things, and
we have ever found him plain-hearted. Then
there is Hope planted in the Saints. Hope is
Faith's Handmaid, it looks for that which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:
Faith determines the Certainty of the
Thing, then Hope looks for it. This Grace
was made on purpose that we might reach out to
Heaven, and see if our Beloved be coming, that
we might expect our full and future Happiness.
God not only provides a glorious Estate for us,
but Grace to expect it; he works this Hope in us,
that we might look after it: 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 3. He hath
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47528:124"/>
begotten us again unto a lively Hope.</hi> Then there
is <hi>Love</hi> in the Saints to Christ. This is an Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Union, it desires to be with the Party belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
he desireth to be with us, and we with
him. Love awakeneth earnest Longings: <hi>O come,
come! why is his Chariot so long a coming?</hi> As a
loving Wife stands upon the Shore, as ready to
welcome her expected Husband: So doth Love
in the Saints, they desire to be with Christ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they long for the Kingdom of God coming
to themselves, out of Love. <hi>Phil. 1. 23. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be dissolved, and to be with Christ.</hi> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same ground they desire the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the Church. Especially is this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with the thoughts of Christ's Love to us.
He hath removed his bodily Presence from us, yet
he cannot be satisfied until he and we meet again.
John 14. 3. <hi>I will come again, and receive you to my
self, that where I am, there ye may be also.</hi> And,
John 17. 24. <hi>And that you may be there with me, to
behold my Glory.</hi> Christ is not satisfied in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Estate, until we be with him, till he hath
our Company, and we be beatified with the sight
of him. Before his coming in the Flesh, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
to be with the Saints, before the World
was, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 31. And when the World was
made, before his Incarnation, he took pleasure
to come and appear in the fashion of a Man, and
converse with his People in humane Shape. In the
Days of his Flesh, he delighted to spend his Time,
and busy himself among them that are faithful.
And when he was to go from us, he did assure us
of returning, and cannot be quiet until we be
with him. So, reciprocally (and according to our
measure) doth Love work in us; we cannot be
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47528:124"/>
without Christ, therefore we long to be with him.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Zeal</hi> is planted in the Saints, and a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
for his Glory. It is not their Interest
only, which makes them desire his Coming, but
that the King may sit upon the Throne, that
Christ may reign in the most perfect manner, that
the Day of Manifestation may come, that all
Mists and Clouds which are upon his Person, may
vanish. The Saints, that love the Glory of God
as well as their own Salvation, nay, above their
own Salvation, are longing for that time when
Christ shall be seen in all his Glory, that he may
be dishonoured no more, that Sin and Opposition
may have an end. Here, God ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h not his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Glory, neither from us, nor from the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
neither from Angels, nor Devils. Not his
perfect Glory from us, and therefore the Saints
long for that time, when Christ may be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
in them; it is the Comfort of their Souls,
that God is glorified in their Glory, that there
will a Time come when he shall be admired
and glorified in their Glory, and when they
they shall praise him for evermore, without weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and distraction. And then the <hi>Wicked,</hi> that
they may oppose and dishonour him no more, that
the whole Course of Justice may be seen in the
History of the World, which shall be produced
at the Day of Judgment; that his Power may be
seen, when Devils and all ungodly Men are trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
under foot, and all Offences taken away, and
all opposite Powers are abolished. First, Christ
would zealously affect us to the Glory of God,
<hi>Hallowed be thy Name;</hi> then he would have us
pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom come:</hi> That our Zeal for
God's Glory, might make us earnest and instant
for his Kingdom. Then,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:47528:125"/>
3. There are certain Experiences that we have
here, which set us a longing and groaning for
this time. <hi>Rom. 8. 23. We which have the First-fruits
of the Spirit, groan within our selves, waiting
for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of our Body.</hi>
When they have tasted of the Clusters of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
O they long to see the Land; they long that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
the Captain of their Salvation, the spiritual
<hi>Ioshua,</hi> may lead them into the good Land. The
Church hath here enjoyed Christ in her House:
<hi>I brought him into my Mother's House,</hi> Cant. 3. 4.
Now they would enjoy him in his own House,
have a more plentiful enjoyment of him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have we a taste, but to long for a fuller Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet?
Why doth God give out such a Pittance,
but to awaken our Desires to look for more? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
these Beginnings are sweet, and are a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Mercy; to hear Christ say in a Promise,
Come to me, that you may have Life. But when
once they have embraced this, they will be long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for another Call, for the great Voice to say,
<hi>Come ye blessed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. When Christ
biddeth them welcome into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to the Crown of Glory. When we can get
any Joy in the Holy-Ghost, a little Peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
any sweet Experience of our being clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from Sin, this is reviving and comfortable.
But why is this given, but to set us a longing for
the whole Harvest? for this is but the First-fruits.
It is sweet now to find Pardon of Sin, and any
comfortable feeling of God's Love in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
to have any Doubt resolved, any Fear si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced
and supprest; to have a glimpse of the
Light of God's Countenance, a little Elevation
of the Heart in Duty. Now this draws on the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47528:125"/>
Soul to long for more; for we begin then to think,
what a sweet reviving will it be, when we enjoy
the Full of all these things! If there be but one
Promise now set home upon our Hearts, tho
here we ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e only the Right, not Enjoiment; if
we have but our Right cleared up to a Promise, it
is very reviving. God gives us this Experience,
that we may long to enjoy the thing promised,
the full Possession of it. When you have gone
away feasted with Loves at the Lord's Table, thou
hast said, One Hours Communion with God is
better than all the World. If thy Heart was
melted a little in Duty, if it was affected with
godly Sorrow for Sin, it hath yielded thee more
Comfort, than all the Mirth and Musick which
fond Worldlings chear themselves withal, than
all their Jollity. Now this is but given as a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taste,
as a Prelibation, and to awaken our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
after more. In the Lord's Supper many times
we come and drink of that Cup which God hath
tempered for us; this is but a dark Presignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>new Wine we shall drink in our Father's
Kingdom.</hi> Mat. 26. 29. and of those eternal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
we shall have there, and those unmixed
Joys in the presence of Christ. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the <hi>Tastes</hi> they have had, and those Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of Glory, their Hearts will be more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,
and drawn out to look for more, and
long for that happy time, when all this shall be
accomplished.</p>
               <p>III. There may be Arguments taken and drawn
from the <hi>Coming</hi> it self, that they long for his
Coming. Wherefore doth Christ come? what
are the Ends of it? It is to manifest his Love
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47528:126"/>
to the Saints mainly, as to punish his Enemies,
and glorify his Justice.</p>
               <p>1. I'll mention the first, to gather the Saints
together, to draw all his scattered People into
one holy Body and Communion. <hi>Psal. 50. 5. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my Saints together unto me, those that have
made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice.</hi> Now they
are scattered up and down, as God hath Service
for them to do; one here, another there; they
are spread in several Places, where they are like
two or three Berries in the uppermost top of the
Bough. That Psalm is generally acknowledged
to be spoken of the Day of Judgment, then they
are gathered to meet in one great Assembly; the
Psalmist speaks of the <hi>great Congregation of the
Righteous, where the Sinners shall not stand.</hi> Psal.
1. 5. At that great Day when Christ comes, all
the Saints shall make but one Assembly, and one
Congregation. As the Wicked shall be bundled
together, and the Tares cast into unquenchable
Fire; so all the Saints shall be gathered together
into one great Assembly, and this glads their
Hearts. Therefore we are not feasted to the full,
because we have not all our Company; all the
Guests do not meet together, until the Day the
Son of God comes to bless the Elect.</p>
               <p>2. He comes to proclaim our Pardon, and to
pronounce the Sentence of our Acquittance juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
in Court, as Judg upon the Throne. Our
Pardon is past, and seal'd as to Conscience, then
he will blot out all our Sins; therefore it is said,
Acts 3. 19. <hi>That your Iniquities may be blotted out,
when the Times of refreshing shall come from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Lord.</hi> He comes then to comfort and
refresh the Souls of the Saints, by proclaiming
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47528:126"/>
their Pardon in the Ears of all the World. To
whomsoever the Throne of Christ is terrible, it
should not be terrible to the Saints: If he comes
as a Judg to them, he comes to acquit them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Throne, he means no trouble to them.</p>
               <p>3. He comes to crown us. Certainly there is
a longing for this Day and Coming; for what is
his Work? He comes to crown the Saints. 2 <hi>Tim.
4. 8. Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of
Righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Iudg,
shall give me at that Day.</hi> Then he comes to put
the Crown of Righteousness upon our Heads, and
invest us with all the Fruits of his Purchase; then
the godly Christian comes to have his Crown.
1 Pet. 5. 4. <hi>When the chief Shepherd shall appear,
ye shall receive a Crown of Glory, that fadeth not
away.</hi> He that hath been careful to honour God
in his Relation, then the great Shepherd comes to
put the Crown of Glory which fades not away,
upon his Head.</p>
               <p>Are the Children of God always in this Frame,
as to desire his Coming? Many tremble at the
thoughts of it, and can have no comfort, for
want of Assurance of God's Love; and many
times the Saints do not feel such Inclinations, and
such ardent and strong Desires.</p>
               <p>I answer:</p>
               <p>1. The meanest Saint hath some Inclination
this way; he cannot but desire Christ should come
into his Heart, and bless him, in turning him
from his Sins; and that he should come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
since Comfort and Reward is more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
embraced than Duty. Whoever is begotten
to God, is <hi>begotten to a lively Hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. his
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:47528:127"/>
Heart is carried this way, tho not with so much
Strength and lively Motions as others are. Yet I
grant,</p>
               <p>2. Sometimes there may be a Drowsiness and
Indisposition, when their Lamps are not burning,
when they are grown careless, and fallen asleep;
as the wise Virgins slept, as well as the foolish, by a
sluggish Security. And the Saints may find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
indisposed; possibly by the remission of their
Watchfulness; they may contract an Indispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet there is a Spirit stirring this way, which
begins with the new Birth, and still continues,
tho it doth not always alike put forth it self. A
Wife desires her Husband's coming home, yet it
may be all is not in such good Order. Now all
Christians desire the coming of Christ, but they
are not so watchful, therefore are not so lively.
Security brings Deadness, until God awakens
them by some sharp Affliction. The Needle that
is touched with the Loadstone, yet may a little be
discomposed and turned aside, but it settles again.
This is the right Posture and Frame of a gracious
Soul, to be thus earnestly bent and carried out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the coming of Christ.</p>
               <p>3. I answer again: The Church doth really
and heartily desire this Coming, tho they may
tremble at some Circumstances of it. When we
think of this great Day, and of the Book that
shall be opened, and the impartial Proceedings,
there is some degree of Bondage still left in the
Saints, that doth a little weaken their Confidence
and Boldness. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 18. we are told, <hi>Perfect
Love casteth out Fear, because Fear hath Torment.</hi>
Until our Graces are perfect, there is something
of Fear.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To reprove those that do not desire the
coming of Christ, but put off the thoughts of it;
why? Because it casts a damp upon their fleshly
rejoycing: Which <hi>put far away</hi> the Day of the
Lord, the <hi>evil Day;</hi> it is so to them, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 3.
They wish it would never come, and would be
glad in their Hearts to hear such News; why?
For Christ's coming is their Torment and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;
they look upon it as a Vengeance, and an
evil Day, therefore are loth to entertain the
thought of it. Saith <hi>Austin, Canst thou pray that
the Kingdom of God may come, when thou art afraid
the Kingdom of God should come?</hi> A carnal Man
cannot say the Lord's Prayer, without being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid;
they tremble at the remembrance of it;
they are afraid it should be true, and afraid to
be heard; if it might go by their Voice, Christ
should never come. The Voice of corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is, <hi>Depart from us: And what can the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
do for them?</hi> Job 22. 17. Or if they do
desire it, it is but in a slight formal manner, as
those in the Prophet, that would see the Day of
the Lord, yet they could not bear it. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.
18. <hi>Wo unto you that desire the Day of the Lord; to
what end is it for you? The Day of the Lord is Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and not Light.</hi> They little consider what
they are doing, and what is their Danger, when
they are making such a Prayer to God, <hi>Thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

the Coming of Christ? Are you carried
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:47528:128"/>
out with such an Inclination and Bent of Heart,
as the Day of your Perfection, and the Day of
your solemn Enjoyment of God? Is the Bent
of your Heart carried out to things to come? If
there be looking, then there would,</p>
                  <p>1. Be a preparing. A Man that expects and
desires the coming of a great Person to his House,
will make all things ready, is careful to furnish
himself: When all is sluttish and nasty, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Provision, do you look for your Guest?
What have you done, as to the Day of Christ's
Coming? Have you <hi>judged your selves?</hi> 1 Cor.
11. 31. <hi>If we would judg our selves, we should not
be judged.</hi> Have you ever seriously passed Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
upon your selves, according to the Law,
that you may be <hi>found in Christ.</hi> Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There
is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ.</hi> That
you may have Christ's Righteousness to bear you
out in that Day, against Christ's Judgment? Are
you so as you would be found in him? Do you
<hi>live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present
World?</hi> Strict walking is a preparing and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for this Day; you do but provide for Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
when you give way to Sin. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10, 11.
<hi>The Day of the Lord will come as a Thief in the
Night; therefore what manner of Persons should ye
be in all holy Conversation and Godliness, looking for,
and hasting unto the coming of the Day of God.</hi> We
should be trimming up our Lamps.</p>
                  <p>2. What kind of Entertainment do you give
to Christ now? Do you entertain him for the
present into your Hearts, in his Ordinances? A
Woman that never cares to hear from her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
doth she long for his Coming? O be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

3. What doth this Expectation produce? what
revivings in the fore-thoughts of it? <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 56.
Abraham <hi>rejoyced to see my Day, and he saw it, and
was glad.</hi> He means the Day of his Incarnation, the
Day of his Abode in the World; <hi>Abraham</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw,
by the <hi>Eagle-Eye</hi> of his Faith, through all Mists,
Clouds, Vails, and Ceremonies; he got a sight
of Christ's Day, and it did him good at Heart.
Do the Apprehensions of it make your Hearts
spring and leap within you for joy? What
Groanings, Longings, what dealing with God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

Expectation of the Creature waiteth for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation

Profit of it; this longing, looking, and waiting
for the coming of Christ, it will make us heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

is in Heaven.</head>
               <p>WE are come to the third Petition, which
is fitly subjoined to the former. In the
Preface we own our Relation to God, <hi>Our Father;</hi>
in the first Petition we express our Care of his
Glory; in the second, our Desires of his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
and now we beg <hi>Obedience to his Will.</hi> We
may judg of our Respect to his Name and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
by our Obedience to his Will, without
which we neither sanctify his Name, nor submit
to his Kingdom. The Kingdom of God impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
two things; his Government over us, or the
Privileges which we enjoy thereby.</p>
               <p>1. As it is taken for his Government over us,
so there is a fair Connection between these two
Requests. <hi>Before,</hi> we pray that God would rule
us; and <hi>now,</hi> for a soft and pliable Heart, that
we may be ruled by him. Christ is not our King,
when we do our own Will. These two are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct;
Government is one thing, and Obedience
to it another: As, <hi>Mat. 6. 33. The Kingdom of
God, and the Righteousness thereof;</hi> they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished:
The Kingdom of God we plead for
in the second Petition, and here for the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thereof; that Christ may not be a Titular
Prince and Sovereign, as certainly he is, when
we do our own Will. Every Sovereign stands
upon his own Will; and the more absolute, still
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47528:129"/>
the more his Will is to be looked upon as a Law
and Rule. Now God being so absolute a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
it is but fit his Will should be done in the
perfectest Manner: <hi>Thy Will be done in Earth, as
it is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If you take the Kingdom of God for the
<hi>Privileges</hi> of his Government, especially if they
be considered in their Consummation, and final
Accomplishment, for that which the Scripture
calls the Kingdom of God; by doing God's Will,
we enter into his Kingdom. See <hi>Mat. 7. 21. Not
every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               </p>
               <p>First; The Matter of the Request, <hi>Thy Will.</hi>
God's Name was under consideration in the first
Petition; his Kingdom, in the second; and now
his Will. And then here's a Note of Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<hi>Thy</hi> Will, in contradistinction to all others.</p>
               <p>God's Will, it signifieth two things; either his
Decree concerning future Events, or else that
which God hath revealed concerning our Duty;
his intended or commanded Will. The first is
spoken of, <hi>Rom. 9. 19. Who hath resisted his Will?</hi>
that is, his <hi>Decree,</hi> and his <hi>Purpose.</hi> And the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
his revealed Pleasure concerning our Duty,
is spoken of, 1 <hi>Thess. 4. 3. This is the Will of God,
even your Sanctification:</hi> The Will not of his <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi>
but it is his Law, his revealed Pleasure.
Now it is not meant here of God's <hi>Decree,</hi> or
<hi>secret</hi> Will. Why? God's secret Will, that is
not <hi>known,</hi> therefore how can it be done upon
Earth? To that all are subject, Reprobates,
Devils. But here this Petition speaks of a Will,
which is to be done in conformity to the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
Again, we may (without Sin) will that,
which God wills not by his secret Will; as the
Life of a sick Parent, which God purposeth to
take away. Nay, a Man may fulfill this secret
Will, and yet perish for ever, as <hi>Iudas,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which break his Commandments, and yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
his Decrees; that do that which God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
before to be done in his secret Purpose,
as it is said, <hi>Acts</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>To do that which his
Hand and Counsel had determined before to be done.</hi>
Therefore his <hi>secret</hi> Will is not here meant, but
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47528:130"/>
the Will of God <hi>revealed.</hi> Therefore let me
here distinguish again: The Will of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
two ways; in his <hi>Word,</hi> and in his <hi>Works;</hi>
the one to be done <hi>by</hi> us, the other to be done
<hi>upon us:</hi> the one is, <hi>Voluntas de nobis,</hi> God's Will
<hi>concerning us;</hi> the other, <hi>Voluntas in nobis,</hi> God's
Will in us, and to be done by us; the one maketh
way for our <hi>Active,</hi> the other for our <hi>Passive
Obedience.</hi> Our Active Obedience hath respect to
his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Commands,</hi> but our Passive to his
<hi>Providence;</hi> we shew as much Obedience in the
one, as in the other, in <hi>Patience,</hi> as in <hi>Holiness:</hi>
For as in <hi>Holiness,</hi> we own God as the supream
<hi>Law-giver;</hi> so in Patience, we own him as the
supreme <hi>Lord,</hi> that hath a Dominion over all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
and all things which fall out in the World.
In the one we pray, <hi>Vt nihil Dei displiceat nobis,</hi>
that nothing which comes from God may provoke
us to unseemly Passion; in the other we pray, <hi>Vt
nihi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> nostrum displiceat Deo,</hi> that nothing which
comes from us may provoke God by unseemly and
und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tiful Carriage. We principally pray for the
latter here, that we may fulfil his Will revealed
in the Word; and yet the other cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
Take but this Reason, because the
Saints in Scripture express their Subjection to
God's Providence, in Words very agreeable to
this Request, to the Form of this Petition; as
those Believers, when they saw God had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Journey to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when he went
bound in the Spirit, notwithstanding the Dangers
of it, and their Loss by his Departure, they said,
<hi>The Will of the Lord be done,</hi> Acts 21. 14. And
Christ himself, speaking of his Passion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.
39. <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt: And not my
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47528:131"/>
Will, but thine be done,</hi> Luke 22. 42. So that we
pray both for the one, and the other, tho with a
plain difference; why? For our Active Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
must be even without a conditional Desire,
that the Commands of God should be repealed;
we cannot so much as desire God should disannull
his Law, and repeal those Statutes he hath enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Yet we may desire conditionally, if God see
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it, the removal of our Affliction, and that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Life, to which we are determined by
his Providence. <hi>The Commandment is not grievous</hi>
in it self, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 3. yet the Affliction in its
own Nature is grievous, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. We may
desire more knowledg of God's Law, yet we may
not desire more experience of Affliction; the one
is more absolutely necessary than the other. We
are not only to obey actively, but to love the
Commandments of God, and to have our Hearts
carried out in a greater esteem, and to prefer them
before Liberty it self; but I doubt whether we
are so concerning our Afflictions, to prefer them
before Freedom and Exemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

               <p>Well then, you see what is meant by the Will
of God, which is the Matter about which this is
conversant.</p>
               <p>Then here's the Note of Appropriation, <hi>Thy</hi>
Will, in opposition to our own Will, the Will of
Satan, the Wills of Men.</p>
               <p>1. To our <hi>own</hi> Will, which is the proudest E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
Christ hath on this side Hell, and the cause
of all the Mischief which doth befall us. The
great Contest between us and God is, whose <hi>Will</hi>
shall stand, God's <hi>Will,</hi> or ours. In every Sin
we slight the <hi>Will</hi> of God, and set up our own. We
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47528:131"/>
                  <hi>despise the Commandment,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 9. Not
grosly and formally; <hi>David</hi> did not slight the
Commandment, and say, <hi>Tush, it is a foolish Law;</hi>
but by necessary Interpretation we slight the Law
of God, and set up our own Will. Therefore
when we pray, that God's Will may be done, we
do in effect renounce our own Will, those <hi>Wills
of the Flesh and Mind,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
speaks of; so it is in the Greek. The Soul
is never renewed, until the Will be renewed, till
the Will be broken. And therefore Self-denial
is made one of the first Principles of Christianity,
the denying of our own Will. The Will is the
leading part of the Soul. Tho the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
begins with the Mind, yet it comes not to
any Perfection, it is not formed, until the Will
be subdued to God, until Grace be seated in the
Heart. When a Man treadeth on a dry Hide,
one part or other will be apt to rebound, and leap
up against him, till he stands in the middle and
Center: So, until Grace be seated in the Heart,
Corruption will recoil. When a Bird's Wings are
broken, it can flie no longer; so when the Will
is subdued, then the work of Grace begins. The
Mind is the <hi>Counsellor,</hi> but the Will is the <hi>Monarch</hi>
and Prince, which sways and rules all in the Soul.
Again, the Will is more corrupted than the Mind;
the Understanding is much blinded, but the Will
is more depraved. The Mind hath a little Light,
and is apt to take God's part sometimes, by sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting
good Motions; but the VVill doth more
<hi>abhorr</hi> and <hi>refuse</hi> Good, than the Understanding
is <hi>ignorant</hi> of it. VVe are <hi>convinced</hi> often, when
not <hi>converted.</hi> Therefore this is the main thing,
that our corrupt VVill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> may be subdued to God;
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47528:132"/>
Let thy VVill be done, not our own.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Thy</hi> VVill, in opposition to Satan's VVill.
Our Lusts are called his Lusts; <hi>Iohn 8. 44. The
Lusts of your Father the Devil ye will do.</hi> They
are of his inspiring, of his cherishing; the grand
<hi>Incubus</hi> of Hell is the Father of these Brats, and
sinful Productions. So, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. the Holy-Ghost
speaks of carnal Men, that they are <hi>taken
captive by Satan at his will and pleasure.</hi> VVicked
Men are at Satan's beck, and they do his will. The
Devil sets such a Lust at work, the Man obeys
presently: The Devil stirs such Lusts by his Arts
and Engines, and observes such a Lust will be
most prevalent at such a time; the Man is taken
by Satan's Will. Now, <hi>Thy Will,</hi> &amp;c. we desire
the Lord's Grace, that we may not comply with
the Devil's Motions.</p>
               <p>3. Thy Will, in opposition to the Wills of
<hi>Men.</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 2. <hi>That he no longer should live to
the Lusts of Men, but to the VVill of God;</hi> not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Wills of Men, but according to the
Will of God. In our natural State we are apt to
be swayed by the Lusts and Humors of others,
according as the Posture of our interest is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;
and therefore it is a good piece of Self-denial
to cease from the Lusts of Men, from the
Humors and Customs of those whom we fear, and
from whom we hope: And until we cease from
Men, in vain do we expect to serve God.</p>
               <p>Thus for the Matter about which this Request
is conversant, <hi>Thy Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly; Here is the Request it self, <hi>Be done;</hi>
what doth this imply, when we say, Let thy Will
<hi>be done?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:47528:132"/>
1. We beg a Heart to do it. <hi>Deut. 5. 29. O
that there were such an Heart in them, that they would
fear me, and keep all my Commandments always!</hi> It
is not enough to set our selves to do what God
hath commanded; but we must get a renewed,
sanctified Heart.</p>
               <p>2. We beg Skill to do it. Psal. 143. 10. <hi>Teach
me to do thy will, for thou art my God.</hi> We beg that
God would teach us, and lead us forth in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of his Will.</p>
               <p>3. We beg Strength to do it. It is said, <hi>Heb.
13. 21. The God of Peace,—through the Blood of
the everlasting Covenant, make you perfect in every
good Work, to do his Will.</hi> We beg Strength, that
we may do what is pleasing in his Sight. In our
Will there is a double Mischief; it is opposite to,
and averse from God. <hi>Rom. 8. 7. The carnal
Mind is Enmity against God; for it is not subject to
the Law of God, nor indeed can be.</hi> And it is
strongly inclined to other things; and this both
by Nature, and by evil Custom. There is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
from God which is natural, and which
is increased by Custom; therefore it is God must
give us a Heart to do his Will, and Skill and
Strength. Thus God, he must draw us off from
other things, which is called the <hi>Circumcising of
the Heart,</hi> Deut. 30. 6. He must draw us off, and
he must draw us on too. As he pares away the
Foreskin, the Fleshiness which cleaves to our
Hearts, and inclineth us to seek our own Will, in
hunting after Pleasures, Honours, Profits: So
doth the Lord draw us to himself; <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4.
<hi>Draw me,</hi> and <hi>we will run after thee.</hi>
               </p>

II. Let's come to the Circumstances of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
[<hi>In Earth, as it is in Heaven.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Place,</hi> wherein also the <hi>Persons</hi> are
noted, <hi>in Earth,</hi> that is by the <hi>Men</hi> which live
upon Earth. Why is this mentioned <hi>on Earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The Earth is a place of our Exercise and
Trial, and now is the time to shew our Self-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and our Obedience to God, to deny our own
Will, and do the Will of God; <hi>Iohn 17. 4. I
have glorified thee upon Earth.</hi> This is a Work
that must not be suspended until we come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
it will not be thank-worthy then, when
there is no Interruption, no Trouble, no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestation
there: but here, <hi>I have glorified thee on
Earth,</hi> where so few mind the Work, and where
there are so many Distractions and Temptations
to divert us.</p>
               <p>2. The Earth is the only place where this
Work is begun, or else it shall never be done
hereafter. Instance in any thing that is the Will
of God. Here we must <hi>believe,</hi> or there we shall
never <hi>enjoy (Luke</hi> 2. 14.) <hi>Peace upon Earth.</hi> Now
God offereth Grace, and now it is his Will we
should come out of our Sins, and accept of
Christ to the ends for which he hath appointed
him. And here we must be <hi>sanctified,</hi> else we
shall be filthy for evermore. Corn grows in the
Field, but it is laid up in the Barn. Now is
the time of minding this Work here upon Earth.</p>
               <p>3. That while we are upon Earth, we might
<hi>long</hi> for that <hi>happy</hi> Estate we shall have in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
wherein we might serve God. Therefore
Christ in his Prayer would have us think how
God is glorified and obeyed there, that we might
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47528:133"/>
send up hearty Wishes after that perfect Estate,
when we shall serve God without Weariness, and
without Distraction.</p>
               <p>4. Upon Earth, to shew, that we pray not for
those in the <hi>other</hi> World, but for those upon
<hi>Earth.</hi> We do not pray for the Saints departed,
they are out of harms way, past our Prayers,
being in their final Estate. We pray not for
the <hi>Dead,</hi> but for the <hi>Living.</hi> Thus for the first
Circumstance in this Petition, the place where.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There remains nothing but the last,
and that's the <hi>manner</hi> how this is to be done;
[<hi>As it is in Heaven.</hi>] <hi>Chrysostome</hi> observes, that
this Clause may be referred to all the former Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions;
<hi>Hallowed be thy Name upon Earth, as it is
in Heaven. Thy Kingdom come upon Earth, as it is
in Heaven.</hi> But certainly most proper it is to the
matter in hand. But what is the sense? How is
God obeyed in Heaven?</p>
               <p>There are in Scripture three Heavens, the
Airy Heaven, the Starry Heaven, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of Heavens. In all these Heavens God's
Will is done. God is obeyed in the <hi>lower</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
you shall see in <hi>Psal. 148. 8. Fire, Hail, Snow,
and Vapours, stormy Winds fullfilling his Word.</hi>
Winds and Storms, and all those things which
seem to be most tempestuous and unruly, to be
the disorders of Nature, they are at God's beck.
Then in the <hi>Starry</hi> Heaven, <hi>vers. 6. He hath made
a Decree which shall not pass:</hi> They are under a
Law and Statute, and are not exorbitant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrick,
do not alter their Path; the Sun riseth,
setts, and knows the just point of his Compass.
But it is chiefly meant of the Heaven of Heavens,
where Angels and blessed Spirits are, and they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47528:134"/>
obey God perfectly. <hi>Psal. 103. 20, 21. Bless the
Lord, ye his Angels, that excel in Strength, that do his
Commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his Word.
Bless ye the Lord, all ye his Hosts, ye Ministers of his
that do his Pleasure.</hi> The Angels do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and are hearkening to the Voice of his
Word, are at God's beck to be sent up and
down, to ascend and descend as God will have
them; so with respect to this doth Christ say,
<hi>Thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here again, why is this added, <hi>As it is in
Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. To <hi>sweeten</hi> our <hi>Subjection</hi> to God's Will.
We upon Earth are not held to a harder Law
and Task, than they in Heaven. The Angels,
they are not <hi>sui juris,</hi> at their own dispose:
They have many Priviledges above Man, yet
have no Exemption from Homage and Duty to
God. They have an Exemption and Freedom
from Trouble, and Sicknesses, and Diseases, and
the necessities of Meat and Drink, and all the
Molestations and Infirmities of the Flesh which
we lie under; but are not freed from the Will
of God, but they obey his Commandments, heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the voice of his Word. These Courtiers
of Heaven are Servants of God, and Fellows with
us in the same Obedience; none is too great to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
God. The Angels which excel in Strength,
they obey his Will, and so must we; nay, they
obey his Will with a holy Awe and Fear, that
they may not displease him in the least; for it is
said of <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-angel, <hi>Iude, vers.</hi> 9.
<hi>That he durst not bring against the Devil a railing
Accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</hi> He
had not boldness to speak one uncomely Word,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47528:134"/>
or one unseemly Word, to do any thing that was
displeasing to God.</p>
               <p>2. As to sweeten our Obedience, so to shew
us the Reasonableness of this Obedience. We
would have the <hi>Happiness</hi> of the Angels, and
therefore, certainly we should come into a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
in their <hi>Duty;</hi> it is but equal we should
imitate their Holiness. If we would have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them in <hi>Glory,</hi> we should have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
also with them in <hi>Grace. Mat.</hi> 22. 30.
it is said, we shall be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>like the Angels of
God.</hi> We seek after the same Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
which they have: to stand before the Lord,
and to behold his Face, that's their Happiness.
Surely if we would have the reward of Angels,
which we upon Earth are aspiring and looking
after; it is but equal we should do the Work of
Angels, and write after their Copy.</p>
               <p>3. Therefore doth Christ use this Comparison,
that we might not miscarry by a <hi>low Example.</hi>
How apt are we to follow the track, and to take up
with an easy and low rate of Obedience, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.
11. that put great Confidence in that, <hi>God, I
thank thee, I am not as other Men.</hi> Now because
we have few Examples in the World, and those
we have, have their Spots and Defects, and are
very susceptible of Evils, and apt to miscarry
by them; therefore Christ would carry us up to
look after a Heavenly and Coelestial Patern;
he propoundeth the Angelical Perfection as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
and Example. He that shoots at a Star, will
shoot higher than he that aims at a Shrub: Surely
the higher the Patern that we aim at, the greater
will our Obedience be. Wicked Men they think
that every thing is enough in Religion, though
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:47528:135"/>
it be never so little; but the Godly cannot so
easily satisfy themselves, they are pressing and
hastening on more and more.</p>
               <p>4. To teach us that we are not only to look to
the <hi>Quid,</hi> but to the <hi>Quomodo;</hi> not only to what
we <hi>do,</hi> but also in what <hi>manner</hi> we yield Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God; therefore Christ would not teach
us to pray only, <hi>Thy Will be done,</hi> but <hi>as it is in
Heaven,</hi> in such a manner. God respects not
only the doing of what he hath required, but
also the manner of it; that we may not only do
<hi>good,</hi> but <hi>well;</hi> it is the Adverb which crowns
the Action. We are to consider with what
Heart we go about it. <hi>Prov. 2. 16. The Lord
weigheth the Spirits.</hi> That which he putteth into
the Ballance of the Sanctuary is, with what Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
with what Heart we go about the Work,
that's it he weigheth and regardeth. Now that
we may look not only to the matter of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but also to the manner how we do it;
therefore doth Christ give us this Patern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will say, Our Obedience is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with many Defects and Infirmities;
therefore, how can we serve God as the Angels
do in Heaven? How shall we take Comfort in
our Obedience, if this be our Patern?</p>
               <p>I answer,</p>
               <p>1. Though we cannot do it in the same <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
yet we should do it in the same <hi>manner;</hi>
though there be not an exact Equality, yet
there should be some answerable Resemblance:
Our Obedience should not be wholly different in
the kind and manner of it from theirs which
serve God in Heaven, though for the degree and
rate we cannot come up to their Patern.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:47528:135"/>
2. Though we do not attain to this Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this Life, yet we must aim after it, long
for it, and pray for it. <hi>Aim</hi> after it, not slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishly
content our selves with any low degrees
of Obedience, but aim at the highest. And to
<hi>long</hi> for it; there is a time coming, when we
shall be perfect; when we shall be not only as
the Angels are, but as Christ is, <hi>We shall be like
him,</hi> 1 John 3. 2. And we <hi>pray</hi> for that on
Earth, what is expected in Heaven; we pray
for what we do expect from the final and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate
Estate, when we shall be as the Angels
of God, and perfectly do his Will.</p>
               <p>I come to the Points; they are three.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It concerns them very much that would in
Prayer own God as a Father, and pretend
a respect to his Glory and Kingdom, to see
that his Will be done here upon Earth.</item>
                  <item>2. It is the Lord that giveth to will, and to
do, those things which are pleasing in his
sight.</item>
                  <item>3. God doth not only look to this, that his
Will be done, but to the manner how it is
done.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. It concerneth them very much, that would
in Prayer own God as a Father, and pretend a
respect to his Glory and Kingdom, to see that his
Will be done here upon Earth.</p>
               <p>I shall prove it:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> By the Arguments intimated in the
Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:47528:136"/>
1. As we pray to God, we should see his Will
be done, upon a double account; as real and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful.</p>
               <p>(1.) As we would express a <hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
in Prayer. They mock God, that pray they
might do his Will, yet have no care to do it;
that declaim against their Lusts, yet hug them,
and keep them warm in their Bosoms. We oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
pray from our <hi>Memories,</hi> than our <hi>Consciences;</hi>
and oftner from our <hi>Consciences,</hi> than our <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
from our Memory, as we repeat Words by
rote, without sence or feeling, or Consideration
of the Importance of them. From our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
rather than Affections. <hi>Austin</hi> observes of
himself; while he was under the Power of his
Lusts, he would pray against Concupiscence, but
his Heart would say, <hi>at noli modo, timebam enim ne
me exaudiret Deus;</hi> but, Lord, not yet, for I am
afraid lest God should hear me. Conscience tells
us that such things must be done, and asked; thus
we put a little of our Conscience in Prayer, but
nothing of Affection and serious Desire. Many
would be loth God should take them at their
words, when they seem to resign up themselves
to his Will, and think of parting with their
Lusts, it is bitter and irksome to them; as <hi>Phaltiel</hi>
(<hi>Michal</hi>'s Husband) <hi>went after her, going and
weeping;</hi> 2 Sam. 3. 16. Now if we would mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
our Prayers to be real, we should labour to
perform the same, otherwise we are but like
those Souldiers which spate upon Christ, and
buffeted him, yet cry'd, <hi>Hail, King of the Iews;</hi>
so it is but a mockage to say, <hi>Thy Will be done,</hi>
yet have no care to do it. Matth. 15. 8. <hi>This
People draweth nigh unto me with their Mouth, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47528:136"/>
honoureth me with their Lips; but their Heart is far
from me.</hi> There is no <hi>Reality</hi> in the Prayer,
whatever be in it, if the <hi>Heart</hi> be not in it. Some
Men's Prayers are but the Fruit of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi>
others but the result of their <hi>Iudgments,</hi>
what is <hi>fit</hi> to be done, rather than of their <hi>Hearts,</hi>
what they <hi>desire</hi> to be done; and they are only
good so far as they do more solemnly express
God's <hi>Right,</hi> not their inward <hi>Desires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) If we would have our Prayers <hi>successful.</hi>
Psal. 66. 18. <hi>If I [regard] Iniquity in my Heart, the
Lord will not hear me.</hi> Clearly, if we will not do
<hi>God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Will,</hi> there is no reason he should regard
<hi>our Will. If I regard Iniquity in my Heart:</hi> there
may be <hi>Sin</hi> in the Heart, but if I <hi>regard</hi> it there,
God will not hear me; if I entertain an <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to it. When the Wind blows, some cold Air
will get into the Chamber, though the Door be
shut never so close; but to leave the Door open
for it, doth not argue such a care of Health as is
requisite: There will be Sin in the Children of
God, but it is not allowed. Love to any known
Sin, makes our Prayers to God to be without suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
So <hi>Prov. 28. 9. He that turneth away his Ear
from hearing the Law, even his Prayer shall be Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
God useth often the Law of Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will pay home Sinners in their own Coin;
we will not hear him, therefore he will not hear
us. The same Argument we have to urge to
God in Prayer, that God hath to urge to us for
Duty and Obedience. What Argument will you
use to awaken your Confidence and Affection?
<hi>By the Blood of Christ we have boldness to come to
him;</hi> Heb. 10. 19. and Eph. 3. 12. This is not
only an Argument to be urged in Expectation of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47528:137"/>
                  <hi>Mercy,</hi> but also in the enforcement of <hi>Duty,</hi> when
God beseecheth you by the Bowels of Christ to
do his Will, and to mind his Work. If the
Blood of Christ cannot prevail <hi>with us,</hi> to bring
us up to the <hi>Will</hi> of God; how can we expect it
should prevail <hi>with God</hi> to bring us in Returns of
<hi>Blessing?</hi> When God speaks, we slight him;
therefore when we speak, God may cast off our
Prayers.</p>
               <p>God speaks more <hi>wisely</hi> to us than we can
to him; we stammer, and lisp, and speak foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in our Prayers to God. There is far more
<hi>reason</hi> why we should hear God, than God hear
us: For there is more <hi>Equity</hi> in his <hi>Precepts,</hi> than
there is <hi>Reason</hi> in our <hi>Prayers;</hi> and we are bound
to obey God's Will, more than he is to grant our
Request: and therefore if we would not have
God turn away his Ear from our Prayers, we
should not turn away our Ears from hearing his
Law and Counsel. John 9. 31. <hi>Now we know
that God heareth not Sinners: but if any Man be a
Worshipper of God, and doth his Will, him he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
It is a general Maxime, Those which were
ready to deprave Christ's Actions, were possest
of the Truth of this; <hi>If any worship him, and do his
Will, him he heareth:</hi> Joh. 9. 32. It is not enough
to keep up a form of worshipping, but we must be
tender of his Will, that's the way to get a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Answer. Thus as we pray, we are bound.</p>
               <p>2. As <hi>God's Children,</hi> so we must do <hi>his</hi> Will.
Mal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 6. <hi>If I be a Father, where is mine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?
and if I be a Master, where is my Fear?</hi>
Relations to God are not <hi>bare Titles,</hi> and grounds,
whereby we may expect favour from God; but
they carry in their Bosom Obligations to <hi>Duty</hi> on
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47528:137"/>
our part. Many will give God good Words,
and fair Titles, but there is no care had of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with his Will. Nay, your owning that
Relation will aggravate your Sin, and be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against you: You owned me your Father,
and have not done my Will. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 50.
<hi>Whosoever shall do the Will of my Father which is in
Heaven, the same is my Brother, and Sister, and
Mother.</hi> These may be sure of a comfortable
Relation to God, and that God will own them
in that Claim, when they make it their Business
to do his Will; otherwise you reproach God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than worship him. When you do your own
Will, and call God Father, you lay the Devil's
Brats at his Door; you pretend to God, and
take his Name upon you; therefore those that
say, <hi>Our Father,</hi> must also say, <hi>Thy Will be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Those that would have respect to God's
<hi>Glory,</hi> must do his <hi>Will.</hi> This is the <hi>Honour</hi> of
God, when you are at his <hi>Command.</hi> God glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Abraham;</hi> rather <hi>Cyrus</hi> than <hi>Abraham</hi> is
there meant, as the Context shews; see <hi>Isa.</hi> 46.
11. <hi>Isa. 41. 2. The Man from the East, whom I
have called to my Foot.</hi> When you are at his
beck, ready to go step by step with God; as God
leads you, you are ready to follow. It was the
Honour of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> that had his Souldiers
at such a Command, that when he said to one,
<hi>Go, he went; and to another, Come, and he came:
Matth.</hi> 8. So it is God's Honour, when he can
bid you do nothing but you are ready to obey,
though with the greatest hazard and loss of all.</p>
               <p>4. Our <hi>Subjection</hi> to his Kingdom. God stands
upon his Authority. What's a King without O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience?
Christ is never received as King, but
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47528:138"/>
where his Will is obeyed; otherwise we mock
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im with an empty Title. The High-Priest's
Servants said, <hi>Hail, King of the Iews,</hi> in mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
thus it is to own him as King, when we
will not yield Obedience. Then do we desire
that his Kingdom may come indeed and in power,
when we resolve to do his Will; to love as God
will have us; and hate, fear, and hope as God
will: <hi>Psal. 143. 10. Thou art my God, teach me to
do thy Will.</hi> If you own God as Soveraign, you
must be in subjection to his Will. Thus this
Prayer will yield us Arguments, as we own him
as a Father, as we profess respect to his Glory
and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall bring other Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
this, to make Conscience of God's Will.</p>
               <p>1. The Example of Christ Jesus, who wholly
yielded up himself to the Will of God; and wilt
thou stand upon thy terms? <hi>Io. 5. 30. I seek not mine
own Will, but the Will of him that sent me.</hi> Christ
did not seek to please his human, his own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Will, but the Will of his Father. This is
true Religion, to be like him whom we worship.
Now we are never like Christ, until we make do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God's Will to be the great business of our
Lives: Wherefore doth he come into the World?
He tells you, to do his Father's Will; <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 49.
<hi>Wist ye not that I must be about my Fathers business?</hi>
This was his sole Employment: so it should
be ours, if we have the same Mind which Christ
had.</p>
               <p>2. Consider God's <hi>Right.</hi> We are not at our
own dispose, but at the Lord's use. God hath a
right in us as he created us. The Perfection of
every thing lieth in fulfilling the Creator's Will,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47528:138"/>
for that's the end wherefore they were made.
The Creatures <hi>are all thy Servants, and continue
this day according to thine Ordinances:</hi> Psal. 119. 91.
We owe our Being, and all we have, from him.
We see among Men, Dependance begets Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance;
a Man that lives upon another, will be
careful to please him. Thou holdest all by the
Indulgence and Bounty of God, therefore it
should be thy study to do his Will. Jesus Christ
hath bought thee; 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 20. Glorify the Lord
in your Souls and Bodies, which are Gods:</hi> That is
God's which he hath bought. A Servant that
was bought, when Men were sold for Slaves, he
was his Master's Money; so his Strength, Time,
Service, belonged to his Master. We are God's,
because he hath bought us, therefore we cannot
live as we will: for this is the property of a Servant,
that he cannot live as he will. Again, as God hath
<hi>begotten</hi> us anew, regenerated us: what's the aim
of his Grace? <hi>That we should no longer live in the Flesh,
to the Lust of Men, but to the VVill of God:</hi> 1 Pet.
4. 2. It is the aim of Grace to cure the Disorders
of the Will, and to bring us to a stricter bond
of Duty and Service to God. And indeed if
Grace hath had its Fruit and Power upon you, you
will <hi>give up your selves to God:</hi> Cant. 7. 10. <hi>I am my
Beloved's:</hi> You are your Beloved's, to be used by
him as he pleaseth. So that unless you will retract
your Vows, you will make Conscience of doing the
Will of God, for he hath a manifest right in you.</p>
               <p>3. Consider our own <hi>Incapacity.</hi> There is
great Reason why our Wills should be given up
to the Will of God, because we are not able to
manage them our selves. By the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Fools, and mad Men, must have a Guardian,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:47528:139"/>
they have lost the Dominion and Power over
themselves, they are to be ruled by another, they
are Slaves by Nature, that must be guided by
another: <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. We are all by Nature Fools,
and it is the greatest Mischief that can be, to be
left to our own Wills; and therefore when God
requireth the Resignation of our Wills, it is but
as the taking of a Sword out of a mad Man's hand,
which will be the cause of his own Mischief and
Ruine: <hi>Nemo laeditur nisi a seipso;</hi> no Man is hurt
by any but by himself, tho he may be troubled
by others. Now since we cannot manage our
own Will, it is fit we should have a Guardian;
and who is more wise than God to govern us?
A Merchant, tho he owns the Ship, and hath
stor'd it with Goods, yet because he hath no
Skill in the Art of Navigation, he suffereth the
Pilot to guide it. Certainly we shall but Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
our selves, unless we give up our selves to
be guided by the Spirit of God according to
his Will.</p>
               <p>4. The benefit that accrueth to us by doing his
Will; we shall have his Favour here, and his
Glory hereafter. His <hi>Favour here,</hi> which is that
which endeareth us to God: <hi>Acts 13. 22. I have
found a Man after mine own Heart, which shall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
all my Will:</hi> These are Men after God's own
Heart that do his Will. And tho we have great
Infirmities, yet because we are bent to do his
Will, they will be passed over; as <hi>David</hi> had h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
Infirmities, yet because it was in his Heart to do
the Will of God, therefore this is a Man after my
own Heart. And you shall have the <hi>Glory of God
hereafter:</hi> 1 John 2. 17. <hi>The VVorld passeth away,
and the Lusts thereof: but he that doth the VVill of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47528:139"/>
God, abideth for ever.</hi> Those things that our
Wills carry us to, they perish. The Inclination
of our Heart carrieth us to the World, Riches,
Honours, Pleasures; but the Will of God car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
us to an everlasting Estate. <hi>The World passeth
away, and the Lusts thereof:</hi> There will a time come,
when those things we will, and are so strongly
addicted to, and <hi>lust</hi> for, will be gone; we shall
have no Relish, no Savor in them, no Appetite
to them. When Men are leaving the World,
then they cry out how the World hath deceived
them; but now he that doth the Will of God
<hi>abideth for ever.</hi> Never any repented of doing
the Will of God; this will stick by us to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and bring us to everlasting Happiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To shew how far they are from any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
respect to God, that upon the least occasion
transgress his Will, and break through Bonds
and Restraints God hath set to them: The Heart
is never right, but when it lieth under the awe of
a Command. Many will fear a <hi>Punishment,</hi>
but it is said, <hi>Prov. 13. 13. He that feareth the
Commandment;</hi> if the Commandment stands in
his way, he dares not break through, it is more
than a Hedg of Thorns, or if Lions stood in
the way. But on the other side, when Men
make no bones of a Commandment, when they
will <hi>transgress for a pair of Shoes,</hi> (as the Prophet
saith) when every small Temptation is enough
to draw them off from God, it sheweth how little
sincere respect they have to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2. It serves to press us to a more tender
regard to the Will of God. To this end consider
these <hi>Motives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:47528:140"/>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 1. His absolute <hi>Authority</hi> to command.
1 <hi>Tim. 6. 15. Who is the blessed and only Potentate,
the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords:</hi> His Will
is enough. I am the Lord, you shall do thus
and thus.</p>
               <p>2. Consider the <hi>Equity</hi> of what he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
<hi>Rom. 7. 12. The Commandment is holy,
and just, and good.</hi> Nothing God commandeth,
but what is agreeable to his own <hi>Nature,</hi> and
what is suited to our <hi>Benefit.</hi> It is no burden to
live justly, soberly, and holily in Communion
with God. It is not a Burden, but a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
The Yoke of Christ is a bountiful
Yoke. Our Service and Duty hath its own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the very Mouth and Bosom of it. It is
no great wrong to us to govern our Affections,
to live soberly, chastly, and in the Exercise of
holy Services; here is nothing but what raiseth
and sublimates the Nature of Man. If the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of God had been to <hi>offer our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in Sacrifice,</hi> or any of those Barbarities
which were practised among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> yet
this had been enough, <hi>I am the Lord:</hi> But when
he hath given such holy and good Commands,
which makes you live more like Men, like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Creatures, you should be tender of the
Lord's Will.</p>
               <p>3. To be given up to our <hi>own Will,</hi> is a great
Judgment. When the Lord hath a mind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
a People, he gives them up to their own
Will; <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 12. Israel <hi>would none of me; so
I gave them up unto their own Heart's Lust: and
they walked in their own Counsels.</hi> It is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Judgment which can be laid upon any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that he may have his own Will. A Man
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:47528:140"/>
may be given up to Satan, yet recover; 1 <hi>Cor.
5. 5. Deliver such a one to Satan for the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Flesh, that the Spirit may be saved in the
day of the Lord Iesus.</hi> He may be given up to
Satan for his Exercise and Trial; but when he
is given up to himself, to the sway of his own
Heart, to be besotted with his own Counsels,
and to have his own Lusts, what a heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is this? When <hi>Balaam</hi> would not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
God said to him, <hi>Go, Numb.</hi> 22. 35. He
had his Answer before, again and again, but he
would be inquiring still; <hi>Go,</hi> and that was his
Punishment.</p>
               <p>4. It is the truest <hi>Liberty</hi> to be subject to the
Will of God. Then, <hi>when the Son of God shall
make you free, you shall be free indeed:</hi> John 8. 36.
How doth the Son of God make us free?
not <hi>from</hi> Duty, but <hi>for</hi> Duty. He that lieth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the dominion and power of any Sin, is a very
Slave. But then are we free indeed, when we
are loosed, not from a due Subjection to God,
but from the Power of the Devil. It is not Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to be free to do what we please, Good or
Evil; but the more determined we are to Good,
the more Freedom; for that's a Liberty which
comes nearest to the Liberty of God, who is a
most free Agent, and yet cannot sin: such a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
is in God, Christ, and the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
surely they do not live a slavish Life, that
are ever praising and lauding of God. It will
be the greatest pleasure in the issue to deny our
own Will, and do the Will of God. The more
we are inlarged for this, the greater is our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness:
then we have the Happiness of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of just Men. None among Men have greater
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:47528:141"/>
Happiness than glorified Saints, yet none have
less of their own Will. Why should we account
that a Bondage, which is part of our Happiness?
In Heaven, glorified Spirits there are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of any Burthen, yet they have no Will
of their own, but they will and nill as God doth.</p>
               <p>5. He that hath a Heart bent to do the Will of
God, he hath the clearest knowledg of the Mind of
God. John 7. 17. <hi>He that will do the Will of God,
he shall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God.</hi>
It is not the sharpness of Parts that pierceth into
a Truth, especially into a controverted Truth,
when the Dust of Contention is raised; but he
that is most close in walking with God, it is he
that knoweth his Mind. A blunt Iron, when hot,
and in the Fire, will pierce deeper into an Inch-Board,
than a sharper Tool that is cold: So a
Man that hath pure Affections for God, a Heart
to do the Will of God, pierceth deeper many
times into controverted Truth, and sees more of
the Mind of God in that Truth, than a Man of
Parts doth. There are many Mistakes about the
Will of God; now make Conscience of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
do not consult with the Interest of your
own private Passions, and then you shall know the
Mind of God. It is just with God to with-hold
the Light from them that consult with their Lusts
and Interests, and carnal Humors, for these blind
the Mind, and only like and dislike Things, as
they shall relish with their Lusts.</p>
               <p>6. God will surely punish the Violation of his
Will. This implieth two things:</p>
               <p>(1.) That God takes notice of it; he observes
whether his Will be done, yea, or no. The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites</hi>
were tender of the Commandment of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:47528:141"/>
their dead Father, which could not take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of their Actions; but it was the Will of
their Father, and they would keep to the Will of
the Dead, <hi>Ier.</hi> 35. 14. But now the Lord seeth
whether his Will be kept, yea, or no. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 3.
<hi>The Eyes of the Lord are in every Place, beholding
the Evil and the Good.</hi> Where ever you are, God
is with you. As the Prophet said to <hi>Gehazi, Went
not mine Heart with thee?</hi> 2 Kings 5. 26. meaning
his prophetical Spirit. The Lord's Spirit goeth
along with us where ever we go, he observes what
we do. When Jesus Christ was in the Throng,
he saith, <hi>Who is it that toucheth me?</hi> He was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Virtue passed out from him, when one tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
him by Faith: So in the Throng of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
we depend upon God; he knows what Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
goeth out to preserve thee and me in Being.
These are fit Instances to ingenerate in our Minds
a sense of God's Omniscience.</p>
               <p>(2.) He will severely punish. <hi>Iam. 4. 12. There
is one Law-giver, who is able to save, and to destroy.</hi>
There are many Law-givers in the World, that
have Power of Life and Death, but that's only of
Life Temporal: But there is one Law-giver,
that can reward with eternal Life, and punish
with eternal Death. So God truly and properly
hath the Power of Life and Death. Therefore
since he can punish so severely, we should not
stand out against God's Will. Many times the
doing God's Will is irksom to Flesh and Blood;
but remember, Hell will be worse. When we
press Men to Faith, Repentance, and new Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and tell them, this is the Will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
you, that you do believe in Christ, walk
holily and humbly with God; what saith the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:47528:142"/>
Man? Shall I mope my self, and sit mourning
in a Corner, and spend my Life in a dark melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
manner, in going from one Duty to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
This is far better than to sit howling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Wrath of God for evermore.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Directions.</hi> If you would do the Will of
God, then,</p>
               <p>1. There must be some solemn Time of resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and giving up thy Will to him. Naturally we
are averse: Now whosoever is brought unto
God, he comes and lays down the Weapons of
his Defiance at God's feet. God hath a Right
to us, and he will have this Right confirmed by
our Grant and Consent. <hi>Rom. 12. 1. I beseech you
by the Mercies of God, that ye present your Bodies a
living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.</hi> There
cannot be a more acceptable Sacrifice to God, than
the Resignation of our own Will to him. See
how <hi>Paul</hi> comes, and layeth down the Buckler,
when God had him under; <hi>Acts 9. 6. And he
trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what wilt thou
have me to do?</hi> There will be a time, when you
will solemnly give up the Keys of your own Hearts
to God, and bid him come and enter. <hi>Paul,</hi> that
now did nothing but threaten, and breath out
Terror to the Children of God, when God had
humbled him, then he lies at God's Feet. When
you are truly humbled, you will desire God to
come and take possession of your Hearts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to come under his Yoke. <hi>Mat. 11. 28. Take
my Yoke upon you, and you shall find Rest for your
Souls.</hi> Christ will force it upon none. In the
Matrimonial Contract, Consent is not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
<hi>Take my Yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:47528:142"/>
2. When you give up your selves to God, it
must be without Bounds and Reservations: <hi>That
ye may stand perfect and compleat in the VVill of God,</hi>
Col. 4. 12. That was his Prayer for them. And,
Acts 13. 22. <hi>I have found</hi> David, <hi>the Son of</hi> Jesse,
<hi>a Man after my own Heart; he shall fulfill all my
VVill.</hi> We should so perfectly obey, as if we
had no Will of our own, not reserving a Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in any thing. Our Thoughts are not our own
to dispose, nor our Desires, nor Delights, but
as God will. The least Sin reserved, is a Pledg
of the Devils Interest and Right in us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
give up all to God, resign up your selves
wholly to him, as remembring that every Motion,
every Thought, every Affection is under a Rule;
and in every Action we should say, Will God have
this to be done, yea, or no?</p>
               <p>3. There are some special Things, concerning
which God hath more expresly signified his Will,
and given special Charge; and these we should
make greatest Conscience of, how distasteful so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they be to Flesh and Blood, or prejudicial to
our own Interest. For Instance; Concerning
<hi>Repentance,</hi> and turning from Sin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11.
you have God's Oath, that he delights in it: <hi>As
I live, saith the Lord God, I have no Pleasure in the
Death of the VVicked, but that the VVicked turn
from his way, and live.</hi> And, <hi>God would not have
any to perish, but that all should come to Repentance.</hi>
2 Pet. 3. 9. This is the Will of God; he hath
told you what a great deal of Pleasure he takes
in Repentance, that you should come and mourn
over your Sins, and bewail your Straglings.
When a prophane <hi>Esau</hi> knew what his Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
he takes his Bow, to go and kill Venison:
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47528:143"/>
When we know any thing more pleasing to God'
we should do it. And then he takes pleasure also
in the Work of Faith, believing in Christ. <hi>Iohn
6. 29. This is the VVork of God, that ye believe on
him whom he hath sent.</hi> And, 1 Joh. 3. 23. <hi>This is his
Commandment, that we should believe on the Name of
his Son Iesus Christ.</hi> Therefore we should be
much in the Work of Faith, and in receiving
Christ, that we may accomplish the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of God in us. It is very pleasing to God,
we should thus repent, believe, and return to
him. The very first Motion, how welcome is it
to the Lord! <hi>Psal. 32. 5. I said, I will confess my
Transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the
Iniquity of my Sin.</hi> So, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 20. the Father
ran to meet him, when the Prodigal thought of
returning. So, that you should live a sanctified
Life. 1 <hi>Thess. 4. 3. This is the VVill of God, even
your Sanctification.</hi> That you should walk holily,
God hath expresly declared his Will. Then for
Duties of <hi>Relations:</hi> God takes a great deal of
pleasure in Obedience to Magistrates, Parents,
Masters: 1 Pet. 2. 15. <hi>For so is the VVill of God,
that with well-doing ye may put to silence the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of foolish Men.</hi> Then, that we should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Providences, ever be in a thankful frame:
1 Thess. 5. 18. <hi>In every thing give thanks; for this
is the VVill of God, in Christ Iesus, concerning you.</hi>
It is a great Rebellion and Disobedience, not to
obey God's solemn Charge.</p>
               <p>4. We should be willing to obey God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it cost us. The least Sin is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
to avoid the greatest Trouble. You
would think it were a small Sin, for <hi>Moses</hi> to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, where he might be helpful
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:47528:143"/>
to the People of God; yet he <hi>chose rather to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the
Pleasures of Sin for a Season.</hi> Heb. 11. 25.</p>
               <p>5. For the greatest Good that possibly can come
of it, we should not cross God's revealed Will.
Many times this is a Snare. Men think to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by their good Intentions. We must not <hi>do
Evil, that Good may come thereof.</hi> Rom. 3. 1. If
one Lie could save the World, we were not to
do it; for the least Evil is not to be done, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to God's Will, tho the greatest Good come
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Examine how you stand affected to
God's Will. This is very needful: Because,

                     <item>1. There be many Mistakes about it.</item>
                     <item>2. Hereby we may discern whether we are
thus entirely affected with the Lord's Will.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Men flatter themselves with a pretence of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and cry, Lord, Lord, but do not do
his Will. They give God good Words, but do
not break out into an actual Contest; as those
Wretches, <hi>Ier. 18. 12. VVe will every one do the
Imagination of his evil Heart.</hi> And, <hi>Ier.</hi> 44. 17.
<hi>VVe will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out
of our own Mouth.</hi> There are many things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we are apt to mistake: As,</p>
               <p>1. We pretend to do God's Will in general,
but when it comes to Particulars, we stick at it.
Usually when we take up Duty by the Lump, it
doth not exasperate opposite Propensions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.
This is our great Fault, we please
and flatter our selves with Notions, and abstract
Conceits. What say you to this Will of God
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:47528:144"/>
concerning you in particular? How forward
were the <hi>Israelites!</hi> O they would do the <hi>whole
VVill of God,</hi> they run away with the general
Notion: Yea, but saith <hi>Ioshua,</hi> chap. 24. 19.
<hi>Ye cannot serve the Lord: for he is an holy God, he
is a jealous God; he will not forgive your Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
nor your Sins.</hi> We vvill do the Will of
God in general; but when it comes to cross our
Lusts, and private Inclinations, these make us
grudg at it, and shrink back again.</p>
               <p>2. Some commend and approve the Will of
God, and talk of it, but do not practise it. It is
here, <hi>Thy VVill be done;</hi> it is not, Let it be talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, spoken and conferred of by me, but done.
And it is not giving <hi>good words.</hi> You know the
Parable of the two Sons: One said, <hi>I will not,
and did;</hi> the other, <hi>I go, Sir, and went not.</hi> Mat.
21. 29, 30. Where Christ prefers the open Sinner
before the Hypocrite, that is talking of God's
Will, and seems at a distance to be like the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle,
all of a Fire, but touch him, he is Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cold.
When we are approving much of the VVill
of God in our Judgments, and commending of it,
and do it not, this is in effect to say, I know what
my Father commands me, but I will do as I list.</p>
               <p>3. Another Deceit about the VVill of God is
this: For the present, vvhile vve are in a good
Humour, vvhen our Lusts lie lovv, vvhen the
Heart is vvarm under the Impulsions of a present
Conviction or Persuasion, Men have high thoughts
of doing the VVill of God. <hi>Deut. 5. 27. Speak
thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto
thee; we will hear it, and do it.</hi> There are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Acts of our VVills; there is <hi>Consent, Choice,
Intention,</hi> and <hi>Prosecution.</hi> It is not enough to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:47528:144"/>
                  <hi>consent;</hi> these things may be extorted from us by
moral Persuasion: but there must be a serious
Choice, an invincible Resolution, such an Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as is prosecuted with all manner of Industry
and serious Endeavours, whatever Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
we meet with from God and Men. Then
this Intention, or invincible Resolution is such,
as will not be broken by Difficulties, weakned by
Loss of Interest, not discouraged by the many
Disappointments we meet with, even in our wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon God.</p>
               <p>4. We have many times a seeming Awe upon
the Conscience, and so are urged to do God's
Will, yet the Heart is averse from God all the
while; therefore they strive to bring God's Will
and theirs together, to compromise the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
A notable Instance of this you have in
<hi>Balaam:</hi> He had a Message sent to him, and a
great Bribe; now he had a carnal Heart, which
ran out upon the Wages of Unrighteousness, and
therefore tho he knew the People of <hi>Israel</hi> were
blessed of the Lord, yet first he will go to God.
Numb. 22. 8. <hi>Lodge here this Night, and I will
bring you word again, as the Lord shall speak into
me.</hi> He is very tender, he durst not go with
them, unless the Lord say, Go. But God denies
him; v. 12. <hi>Thou shalt not go with them.</hi> What
then? The Lord refuseth to give him leave.
Then <hi>Balak</hi> sends more honourable Messengers,
and propounds Rewards again; then his carnal
Will is for God; v. 18. Balaam <hi>answered, If</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lak
<hi>would give me his House full of Silver and Gold,
I cannot go beyond the Word of the Lord my God, to
do less or more.</hi> Was not this spoken with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Mind, think you? This was the Dictate of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:47528:145"/>
his Conscience; not for a House-full of Gold durst
he go against God the Lord: Yet you shall find 'twas
a sore Temptation to him, for he goes again to God,
v. 19. <hi>Tarry here this Night, that I may know what
the Lord will say unto me more.</hi> Then saith God,
<hi>Go,</hi> when he saw his Heart was set for the Wages
of Unrighteousness. There was a Reluctancy in
his Conscience, he durst not go, therefore he
would fain bring the Will of God to his Will. In
many Cases we are thus divided, between our
own Affections, and God's Will; between our
Interests, and the Will of God.</p>
               <p>It is a Case often falls out, when there is a
Quarrel between Conviction and Corruption.
When Light is active and strong in Conscience,
Men dare not go against the apparent Will of
God, yet their Hearts hang another way. We
have one carnal Affection or other, and then all
our Business is, to bring God's Will and ours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and how to disguise and palliate the
Matter, that with greatest leave to Conscience we
may seem to contradict the Will of God.</p>
               <p>5. A fifth Deceit about the Will of God, and
that is, a <hi>Wish</hi> that we were brought under the
Power of it, as he that stretcht himself upon his
Bed, and said, O that this were to labour! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Men have a Velliety, a languid and incompleat
Will; they have a <hi>Wish,</hi> but not a <hi>Volition,</hi> not
a serious Desire; and sometimes they may draw
it out to a cold Prayer, that God would make them
better. It is just like a Man, that should lie down
and complain, O that I were at such a place, and
never travel! Would I had performed such a
Task! yet puts not his hand to the Work. Men
<hi>would,</hi> but they <hi>will</hi> not set themselves in good
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:47528:145"/>
earnest to get the Grace they wish for, there is
not striving to accomplish their Will. A Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
no doubt would have the Wares, it is like
he hath a cold Wish, but will not come to the
Price; I will buy it, whatever it cost me. They
have not those active and industrious Resolutions,
such a strong and serious Bent of Heart towards
God, but only a few Wishes.</p>
               <p>6. Hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing the Will of God; as in many Cases,
many will do part of the Will of God, but not
all; they come not fully up to the Mind of God.
For Instance; They will take notice of some
great Commandment, but not of the least; we
cannot dispense with our selves in the least. <hi>Mat.
5. 19. Whosoever shall break one of the least Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
and shall teach Men so, he shall be called
the least in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> We are apt
to say, <hi>It is but a little one, and my Soul shall live.</hi>
No Sin is little, which is committed against a great
God. It argueth more Wickedness, to break
with God for a Trifle, and a very small Matter;
it argueth more Corruption: As a little Force
will make a heavy Body move downward. Again,
in another Case; The Ceremonialist stands upon
some lesser things; as the Jews, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 28.
<hi>would not go into the Iudgment-Hall, lest they should
be defiled,</hi> yet they could seek the Life of the Lord
of Glory. They are not brought under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Lord's Grace, Faith, Repentance, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and the weightier things of the Law;
these are things they regard not. This is Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy.
Like one that comes into a Shop to buy
a Penny-worth, and steals a Pound's worth; so
they are punctual in lesser things, that they may
make bold with God in greater. Again, some
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:47528:146"/>
will do the Will of God in <hi>publick,</hi> where they
may be observed, but not in private, and when
alone. They make a fair shew in the World, but
in their Families their Converse is more loose and
careless. <hi>Psal. 101. 2. I will walk within my House
with a perfect Heart.</hi> A Man that is truly holy,
will shew it at home and abroad, in his Closet,
and secret Retirements, every where he makes
Conscience of the Will of God. Many times
we strain our selves, and put forth our Gifts in
publick; God will be served with our utmost in
secret also; and the Will of God is exprest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the inward, as well as the outward Man;
and we must make Conscience of both. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 7.
<hi>Let the wicked Man forsake his Way, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
Man his Thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. Not only make
Conscience of our Way, our outward Course,
but of our Thoughts, as well as our Actions; for
the Thoughts fall under a Law. So some will
make Conscience of the First-Table Duties, and
neglect the Second; and some of the Second, and
neglect the first. Some are very punctual in
dealing with Men, but neglectful of God. <hi>Rom.
1. 18. The Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven,
against all Vngodliness and Vnrighteousness of Men.</hi>
Both Tables are owned from Heaven. Some
will not wrong their Neighbour of a Farthing,
but stick not to rob God of all that Faith, Fear,
Love, Trust, Worship, that is due to him. Many
that will not defile their Bodies with promiscuous
Copulation, yet are Adulterers and Adulteresses
to God, their Hearts stragling from God, doting
upon the Creature, to the Wrong of God. Many
condemn the Rebellion of <hi>Absalom,</hi> and rise up
against their heavenly Father, and are Murtherers,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:47528:146"/>
that strike at the Being of God. They are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of wronging the Reputation of Men, yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
God, and are never troubled. So (on the
other side) others fear and worship, but in their
Dealings are very unconscionable; they will not
swear an Oath, but are very uncharitable, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
their Brethren without pity and remorse.
This is the fashion of the World, to be in with
one Duty, and out with another.</p>
               <p>7. A Loathness to know the Will of God, to
search and enquire into it, argueth Deceit, and
that we are loth to come under the Power of it.
Some Men shrewdly suspect it is true, but are loth
to enquire into it. <hi>Iohn 3. 20. Every one that doth
Evil, hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light,
lest his Deeds should be reproved.</hi> They have a
shrewd Guess about the Ways of God, but will
not search to be satisfied. 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 5. They are
willingly ignorant.</hi> As <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
they would not search into the Christian
Religion, because they had a mind to hate it:
So these are loth to enquire further into the Will
of God. There's a great deal of Deceit in it;
it shews we are afraid to come too near a suspected
Truth. Again, now and then when Lusts are
under some restraint, Men seem to lie much under
the Will of God. A Horse that is kept low, is
easily ruled by the Rider; but when fed high, he
grows head-strong. Many times in a mean Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
a Man seems to make Conscience of doing
the Will of God; but when prosperous, he wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
wanton and disobedient. <hi>Ier. 5. 5. I will get
me to the great Men, but these have altogether bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Yoke, and burst the Bonds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:47528:147"/>
So that there are a great many Mistakes about
doing the Will of God, therefore you had need
search.</p>
               <p>Secondly; How shall we know we are rightly
affected with the Will of God?</p>
               <p>1. When God's Will is Reason enough for
what he hath required of us; when a Man is so
sensible of God's will, that this is instead of all
Reasons. Obedience is never right, but when it
is done upon the meer sight of God's Will. This
is enough to a gracious Heart, that this is the
Will of God, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 15. 1 Thess.</hi> 5. 18. tho
the Duty be never so cross to our own Desires
and Interests. This is to obey the Commandment
for the Commandment's sake, without any other
Reason or Inducement. There is indeed <hi>Ratio
formalis, &amp; Ratio motiva;</hi> the formal Reasons of
Obedience, and the Motives of Obedience: The
formal Reason of Obedience, is the sight of God's
Will, the Motives to Obedience are Rewards,
and a Dread of Punishment. The formal Reason
is God's Will; and this is pure Obedience, to do
vvhat God vvills, because God vvills it.</p>
               <p>2. When a Man is very inquisitive to know
what is the Will of his heavenly Father. When
he doth not only practise what he knows, but sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
that he may know more. <hi>Rom. 12. 2. That
ye may prove what is that good and acceptable, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Will of God.</hi> And, Ephes. 5. 17. <hi>Be ye not
unwise, but understanding what the Will of the Lord
is.</hi> When a Man is desirous to know the whole
Will of God, not for Curiosity, but for Practice,
that he might do it. When the Understanding
hath a confused Notion of a thing, they will not
know it distinctly; but when Men search, and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:47528:147"/>
are willing to find out the Counsel of God in all
things, that they may come up to it; this is a
Sign the Heart is rightly affected to the Will of
God.</p>
               <p>3. Hereby may you know your Affection to
God's Will, by keeping your selves from your Sins.
<hi>Psal. 18. 23. I was upright before him, and kept my self
from mine Iniquity.</hi> There is an Iniquity that we
may call ours, upon which the Will is most passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately
addicted; be it Worldliness, Sensuality,
inordinate Desire of Reputation and Respect with
Men. Now when we are <hi>plucking out our right
Eye, and cutting off our right Hand,</hi> Mat. 5. 29.
When we are mortifying and subduing our Lusts,
when we can deny our selves in those things to
which the Heart is most wedded; that's a Sign
of Compliance with the Will of God.</p>
               <p>The second Point.</p>
               <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That it is the Lord which giveth to will
and to do those Things which are pleasing in his
sight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore we ask it of him, <hi>Thy Will be done;</hi>
that is, (as I explain'd it) we ask of him a Heart,
Skill, and Strength, to do his holy Will.</p>
               <p>Here I shall tell you,
<list>
                     <item>1. What I mean by the Point.</item>
                     <item>2. Give you the Proof of it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I. What I mean by the Point.</p>
               <p>1. I mean thus, That in the Work of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
God doth all. <hi>Ezek. 11. 19. I will give
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:47528:148"/>
them one Heart, and I will put a new Spirit within
you; and I will take the stony Heart out of their
Flesh, and I will give them an Heart of Flesh.</hi> The
Benefit of a tender sanctified Heart is God's Gift.
Ezek. 36. 26, 27. <hi>A new Heart also will I give you,
and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take
away the stony Heart out of your Flesh, and I will
give you an Heart of Flesh, and I will cause you to
walk in my Statutes.</hi> Mark, a <hi>new</hi> Heart, that is,
<hi>another</hi> Heart, a Heart to understand, a Heart
to love, a Heart to do the Will of God, he <hi>gives</hi>
it: He doth not only remove it, or prepare it,
make way for it, but I will give you a Heart of
Flesh.</p>
               <p>2. This is that I mean, That after Conversion
God still concurreth; He doth not only give
Grace, but actual Help in the Work of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
<hi>He worketh all our Works in us.</hi> Isa. 26. 12.
His actual Help is necessary to direct, quicken,
strengthen, protect and defend us. To <hi>direct</hi> us:
Psal. 73. 24. <hi>Thou shalt guide me by thy Counsel,
and bring me to thy Glory.</hi> In our way to Heaven,
we need not only a Rule and Path, but a Guide.
The Rule is the <hi>Law</hi> of God, but the Guide is the
<hi>Spirit</hi> of God. To <hi>quicken and excite us</hi> by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Motions. A Drousiness and a Deadness is
apt to creep upon our Hearts, and we see in the
same Duty, it is a hard matter to keep up the
same Frame of Spirit, the same Vigor of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
Life, and Warmth; and therefore vve
had need go to God often, as <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 119.
37. <hi>Quicken thou me in thy Way.</hi> It is God vvhich
doth renew the Vigor of the Life of Grace upon
all occasions, when it begins to languish and
droop. To <hi>corroborate and strengthen</hi> vvhat vve
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:47528:148"/>
have received. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 16. the Apostle prays
there, that he would <hi>strengthen with might by his
Spirit in the inner Man;</hi> and, 1 Pet. 5. 10. <hi>Make
you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</hi> There
are many Words heaped up there, to shew, how
God is interested in maintaining and keeping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot
that which he hath planted in the Soul. In
<hi>protecting</hi> and <hi>defending</hi> them against the Incursions
and Assaults of the Devil, who always lieth in
wait to surprize the Soul, to withdraw us from
God. The Regenerate are not only escaped out
of his Clutches, but are advanced and appointed
to be Satan's Judges, which an envious and proud
Spirit cannot endure, therefore he maligns, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults,
and besiegeth them with Temptations dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Now it is God that defends; <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 11.
<hi>Keep through thine own Name, those whom thou hast
given me:</hi> By thy <hi>Name,</hi> that is, by thy <hi>Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. God must not only help us in the general,
and upon weighty occasions, but in every Act,
from the beginning of the Spiritual Life, to the
end. It is not enough to say, that the first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Motions are of God, but the flowing
forth of all Motions and Actions, according to
those Principles. Phil. 2. 13. <hi>It is God that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in you, both to will and to do, of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
God not only gives the Desire and Purpose,
but he gives Grace to do the Good which we will
and purpose to do. These two are distinct; and
we may have Assistance in one kind, and not in
another: Willing and Doing, I mean, are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom. 7. 18. To will, is present
with me; but how to perform that which is good, I find
not.</hi> To <hi>will,</hi> is more than to <hi>think;</hi> and to <hi>exert</hi>
and put forth our Will into <hi>Action,</hi> it is more
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:47528:149"/>
than both: and in all we need God's help. We
cannot think a good Thought, nor conceive a
holy Purpose, much less perform a good Action,
without God; so that every moment we need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
Strength. As long as the Work of Grace
is powerful and renewed in us, so long we are
kept in a warm and healthful Frame; but we
grow vain, loose, earthly, carnal again, and off
from God, when this Heat and Warmth of Grace
is withdrawn. And therefore God still concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
in the whole Business of our Obedience to
him.</p>
               <p>II. Having shewed what I mean, and how far
God is interested in this Work, what need we
have to desire we may do his Will; let us prove
it: And because it is a weighty Point, I shall
prove it by parts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As to the first Grace, that it is God alone,
which frames our Hearts to the Obedience
of his Will.</item>
                  <item>2. That vvhen vve are thus framed by Grace,
after Conversion, it is God still concurs, and
must help us to do his Will.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>First;</hi> As to the first-Grace, I shall prove that
it is God alone, by the Power of his own Spirit,
vvhich frames our Hearts to the Obedience of his
Will. This vvill appear, by considering,
<list>
                     <item>1. What Man is by Nature.</item>
                     <item>2. The Words by which our Cure is expressed,
and the Way God takes to put us into a Course
of Obedience.</item>
                     <item>3. What the Scripture speaks, as to the utter
Impotency of Man, to the framing of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eart
to the Obedience of God's Will.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:47528:149"/>
                  <hi>First;</hi> This will appear by those Motions
or emphatical Terms, by which the Scripture
doth set forth Man's Condition before God works
upon him. He is one that is <hi>born</hi> in <hi>Sin:</hi> Psal. 51.
5. <hi>Behold I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did
my Mother conceive me;</hi> and things <hi>natural,</hi> are
not easily <hi>altered.</hi> And as he is born in Sin, so
he is <hi>greedy</hi> of Sin; <hi>Iob 15. 16. He drinketh in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
like Water;</hi> it noteth a vehement Propensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
as greedy to Sin, as a thirsty Man to Drink.
Thirst is the most implacable Appetite, Hunger
is far better born: It is the <hi>constant</hi> frame of his
Heart; <hi>Gen. 6. 5. Every Imagination of the thoughts
of his Heart is only evil continually.</hi> O how many ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating
and increasing Circumstances are there
named, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is a Mint that is always at
work; the <hi>Mind</hi> is coining evil Thoughts; and
the <hi>Heart,</hi> evil Desires and carnal Motions; and
the <hi>Memory</hi> is the Closet and Store-house where
they are lodged and kept. This is the case of
Man, born in Sin, greedy and thirsty of Sin, and
one whose Thoughts are evil continually.</p>
               <p>But may not a Man be reclaimed? Oh no,
for he hath a Heart of <hi>Stone;</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. <hi>I will
take away the Heart of Stone.</hi> Every Man that
comes to be converted, hath a Heart of <hi>Stone,</hi>
and what's that? insensible, inflexible: <hi>Insensible,</hi>
he hath no feeling of his Condition: <hi>Inflexible,</hi> he
will not be moved and wrought upon by the
Word, and the Spirit, and Providence: How
many means are wasted upon him, and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
And <hi>Ier. 17. 9. The Heart is deceitful above
all things, and desperately wicked, who can know it?</hi>
It invents all kinds of Shifts and Excuses to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
God, or rather to cheat it self: When God
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:47528:150"/>
comes to work upon Man, it slides away from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his hand, as if Salvation it self should not save
them. Yea, but is not the <hi>New-Testament</hi> more
favourable to Man than the <hi>Old?</hi> Or, is not Man
grown better, now there is so much of God's
Grace discovered? I answer, there's a perfect
Harmony between the Testaments: there he is
stiled a Child of <hi>Wrath by Nature; Eph.</hi> 2. 3. the
<hi>Elect</hi> as well as others were so. There you will
find him to be <hi>a Servant of Sin;</hi> Rom. 6. 17. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
such an imperious Master as Sin is, never such
a willing Servant as Man is: Sin never leaves
commanding, and we love to work, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are at its beck. There you will find him to
be represented to a Man that hath a <hi>blind Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
and a <hi>hard Heart,</hi> and one that is <hi>averse</hi>
from the Life of <hi>God; Eph.</hi> 4. 18. There you will
find one that is an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> of God,
<hi>Enmity</hi> it self; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. one that neither will nor
<hi>can please God:</hi> One that is <hi>blind,</hi> and knows not
what to do; 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 9. He that lacketh these things,
is blind,</hi> and with such a Blindness as is far worse
than bodily. A Man that is blind in his bodily
Eyes, would think it to be a great Happiness to
have a fit Guide; as in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 11. when <hi>Elymas</hi>
was smitten blind, <hi>he sought about for some body to
lead him by the hand:</hi> But he that is spiritually
blind, cannot endure to have a Guide; or if one
would lead him, and direct him in the right way
he is angry. And as the Scripture represents him
as blind, so without <hi>Strength;</hi> Rom. 5. 9. <hi>Dead
in Trespasses and Sins:</hi> Eph. 2. 5. yea worse then
dead; a dead Man doth no more hurt, his Evil
dyeth with him; but there's a Life of Resistance
and Rebellion against God, that goeth along. I
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:47528:150"/>
have spoken but little, yet put all together, and
then it shews what a miserable wretched Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Man is.</p>
               <p>The Scripture doth not speak this by <hi>chance,</hi>
it is not an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> used once or twice; but every
where, where it speaks of this matter, it sets out
Man to be blind, hard, dead, obstinate and averse
from God. Certainly Man contributes little to
his own Conversion, if the Word of God sets him
out every where to be such a one; he cannot hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirst after Christ, that drinks in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
like Water; nothing in his Nature to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
him to Grace, who is altogether sinful.</p>
               <p>If the Scripture had only said, that Man had
<hi>accustomed</hi> himself to Sin, and were not <hi>born</hi> in
Sin: If it had said that Man is very <hi>prone,</hi> and
not <hi>greedy</hi> and <hi>thirsty</hi> in Iniquity: If it had only
said that Man did <hi>often</hi> think Evil, but not <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually:</hi>
If the Scripture had said, that Man were
somewhat <hi>obstinate,</hi> but not a <hi>Stone,</hi> an <hi>Adamant,</hi>
and like the nether <hi>Milstone:</hi> That he had been
<hi>indifferent</hi> to God and the World, God and the
Flesh, and not a professed <hi>Enemy:</hi> That he had
been a <hi>Captive</hi> of Sin, and not a <hi>Servant</hi> of Sin:
That Man had been <hi>weak,</hi> and not <hi>dead:</hi> only
a <hi>Neuter,</hi> and not a <hi>Rebel:</hi> Then there might have
been something in Man; and the work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
and reducing to God had not been so
great: But the Scripture saith the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that Man is all this and much more; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this clears it up, that his Conversion is not
in himself, but it is God must work this good
Work upon him, or else he can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:47528:151"/>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> Let us consider the Terms how the
<hi>Cure is wrought:</hi> Certainly to remedy so great an
Evil, requireth an Omnipotent, an Almighty
Power. Therefore see how Conversion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in Scripture; sometimes by <hi>enlightning
the Mind;</hi> Ephes. 1. 18. <hi>The Eyes of your Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
being enlightned; that ye may know what is
the hope of his Calling,</hi> &amp;c. Man, the best Creature
on this side Heaven, is stark blind in the things
of God: If he should go to see with the Light of
<hi>Nature,</hi> how would he grope at Noon-day? If
he should put on the Spectacles of <hi>Art,</hi> he will
be but little better. Nay, let him take further,
the Glass of the <hi>Word,</hi> yet how blind in a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
sence. Something there must be done upon
the <hi>Faculty;</hi> the <hi>Object</hi> must not only be <hi>revealed,</hi>
but the <hi>Eye</hi> must be <hi>enlightned:</hi> There are thick
Scales upon his Eye, as <hi>Paul</hi> had in his Blindness,
that must be taken off, before he can see into the
things of God.</p>
               <p>But is this all, enlightning the Eye? No, the
Scripture describeth this Work of God by <hi>opening</hi>
of the <hi>Heart;</hi> Acts 16. 14. <hi>God opened the Heart
of</hi> Lydia, <hi>that she attended unto the things which
were spoken of</hi> Paul. God doth not only <hi>knock</hi> at
the Heart, <hi>that</hi> he doth by his <hi>Word,</hi> and by the
<hi>external</hi> means; but he <hi>openeth</hi> the Heart; he
must <hi>open</hi> the Door, before he can come in, enter,
and take Possession.</p>
               <p>As to the means, God trieth Key after Key,
one Providence after another. As when a Man
would open a Door, he knows not what Key
will fit the Lock, he trieth Key after Key: So
God trieth one Cross, one Affliction after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
one Sermon, one Message after another;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:47528:151"/>
but until he puts his Fingers upon the hole of the
Lock, we shall not open.</p>
               <p>But these Words are not emphatical enough;
therefore it is expressed by a <hi>Regeneration;</hi> John
3. 3. <hi>Except a Man be born again, he cannot see the
Kingdom of God:</hi> Mark, they must not only be
<hi>reformed,</hi> but must be <hi>regenerated,</hi> and born again.</p>
               <p>Now because this is an ordinary Work which
falleth out in the course of Causes, therefore
there's a more solemn Notion used, it is exprest
by a <hi>Resurrection;</hi> Eph. 2. 5. <hi>He hath raised you
up together with Christ.</hi> Yea, but that which hath
been may be again; therefore it is exprest not
only by a Resurrection, but by a <hi>Creation;</hi> Ephes.
2. 10. <hi>We are his Workmanship, created in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
unto good Works:</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 6. <hi>He that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Light to shine out of Darkness, hath shined in
our Hearts:</hi> And we are called <hi>New-Creatures.</hi>
And higher than this, it is expressed not only by
a Creation, but by a <hi>Victory,</hi> and <hi>overcoming:</hi> It
is resembled by <hi>beating</hi> and <hi>binding</hi> of the strong
Man, and <hi>rescuing,</hi> and taking away his Prey
from him; <hi>Luke 11. 21, 22. 1 Iohn 4. 4. By bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into Captivity every proud thought to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Christ:</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 5.</p>
               <p>These Expressions the Scripture useth to set
out the Mystery of Grace, the Power of God that
worketh in us. What is wanting in one, is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in another.</p>
               <p>The third thing I shall produce; That the
Scripture doth expresly deny any Power in Man
to convert himself to God; 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 14. The
natural Man cannot know the things of the Spirit of
God, because they are spiritually discerned;</hi> and as
he cannot <hi>know,</hi> so he cannot <hi>obey;</hi> Rom. 8. 7.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:47528:152"/>
                  <hi>The carnal Mind is Enmity against God; for it is
not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be;</hi>
and <hi>they cannot please God;</hi> ver. 8. And they <hi>cannot</hi>
come to <hi>Christ;</hi> John 6. 44. <hi>No Man can come to
me, except the Father draw him:</hi> and <hi>they cannot do
any thing without Christ:</hi> John 15. 15. And they
cannot <hi>think a good Thought;</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. And
they cannot bring forth <hi>good Fruit;</hi> Mat. 7. 18.
And they cannot speak a <hi>good Word;</hi> Mat. 12. 34.
And they cannot <hi>believe; Iohn</hi> 12. 39. And they
cannot do that which is good; <hi>Ier 13. 23. Ye
that are accustomed to do Evil, cannot do Good.</hi>
From whence doth all this Deficiency in them
arise? partly from Nature, partly from Custom.
Besides the <hi>natural,</hi> there's a <hi>customary</hi> and <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Depravation.</hi> By <hi>Nature</hi> we are averse from
God, and by <hi>Custom</hi> we are more confirmed in
this evil Aversation from God. Man, by lying
long in his Unregeneracy, hath his Aversness from
God increased and strengthened upon him: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
we are in love with the World, and have
declined God, and the things of God. Consider
him in his <hi>Naturals,</hi> he <hi>cannot know the things of the
Spirit;</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>And the carnal Mind cannot be
subject to the Law of God, being at Enmity against
him:</hi> Rom. 8. 7. There are other places express
this <hi>cannot,</hi> which derive it from <hi>Custom;</hi> they are
become Slaves to their Lusts, and their Sins have
gotten such a hand over them that they know not
how to break them off. <hi>Ier. 13. 23. Can the Ethiopian
change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? Then may
ye also do Good, that are accustomed to do Evil.</hi> And
so where it is said, <hi>Iohn. 12. 39. They could not
believe.</hi> Naturally man is unable; but that place
speaks of another degree of Impossibility through
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:47528:152"/>
contracted Obstinacy, and judicial Obduration.
Thus you see Man is wholly impotent, as to this
Work, and it is the Lord alone must do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But here's an Objection. If it be so that
Man hath such an utter Impotency to convert
himself to God; how can it stand with the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
of God, as the Creator of Mankind, to require
the debt of Obedience from him that is not able
to pay? How can it stand with the <hi>Iustice</hi> of
God, to punish him with eternal Death, for the
neglect of that which he is not able to do? and
how can it stand with the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Law-giver, to exhort him by Promises and
Threatnings, who hath no power to do what he
is exhorted to do?</p>
               <p>I answer.</p>
               <p>1. As to the first, How it can stand with the
<hi>Mercy</hi> of God to require the debt of Obedience
from him that is not able to pay? God hath not
lost his <hi>Right,</hi> though Man hath lost his <hi>Power:</hi>
their Impotency doth not dissolve their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
A drunken Servant is a Servant still: It is
against all reason, a Master should lose his Right
by the Servant's default. A prodigal Debtor
hath nothing to pay, yet he is liable to be sued
for the Debt without any Injustice. God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
with us in <hi>Adam,</hi> and gave us a Power,
which we lost by his Fall: and therefore though
our Power be gone, yet God may demand his due
to obey and please him; especially since this Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
God required of <hi>Adam,</hi> was not only due,
by Covenant and positive Law, but by immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Right, and natural Justice of Man. Men
think it harsh to suffer for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fault, to which
they were not conscious, and actually consenting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:47528:153"/>
Yea, but consider, every Man will find an <hi>Adam</hi>
in his own Heart, the Old-man is there, we are
still sinning away those Reliques of natural Light
in Conscience, and those few moral Inclinations
which are left. There is a little Ability and
Strength he hath as a Man, and shall not God
challenge the Debt of Obedience from a proud
prodigal Debtor, that is weakning and wasting
himself more and more? We are proud, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God may exact it of us: we think we
are able to obey, and do his Will, when we are
weak: we are poor, yet think our selves rich;
therefore God may admonish us of our Duty; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his Right, to shew our Impotency and
Beggary, and that we may not pretend we were
not called upon for what we owe. But Man is not
only a proud Debtor, but we are prodigal Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
those Reliques of Conscience, and moral
and human Inclinations which escaped out of the
Ruines of the Fall, we lose those things every
day, and embe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>el them away by the Service of
Sin. Therefore it standeth fully with the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of God, as Creator of Mankind, to require
the Debt of him that wasts that little Stock he
hath.</p>
               <p>2. As to the other part, How it can stand with
the Justice of God to punish him with eternal
Death, for the neglect of that he cannot do? I
answer: Besides <hi>natural</hi> Impotency, there's <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</hi>
We must not consider Man meerly as <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
to Good,</hi> but as <hi>delighting</hi> in <hi>Evil,</hi> as loving
it with all his Heart. This <hi>cannot,</hi> indeed is a
<hi>will not,</hi> it is a voluntary Impotence. <hi>You will
not come to me, that ye might have Life:</hi> John 5. 40.
Our <hi>Impotency</hi> lies in our <hi>Obstinacy:</hi> So Man is
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:47528:153"/>
left without excuse, because we freely refuse the
Grace offered, and by continuing in Sin we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
our Bondage, and draw an inveterate
Custom upon our selves, and so grow every day
more obstinate against God.</p>
               <p>3. As to the last, How can it stand with the
Wisdom of God, to exhort him with Promises
and Threatnings, that hath no Power to do that
vvhich he is exhorted to?</p>
               <p>I answer; These Exhortations, they carry
their own Blessing with them, to those to vvhom
God means them for good. As God's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Word carried vvith it its Povver; <hi>Be there Light,
and it was Light:</hi> And as Christ's Word carried
forth his Povver, it vvas not in vain to say, <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
come forth,</hi> tho he vvas dead, and could not
hear it; there vvas a mighty Povver vvent vvith
the Word. So there's Power goes along vvith
the Exhortations of the Gospel, to vvork Grace
in the Hearts of those to vvhom God intends it
as a Blessing.</p>
               <p>Yea, but if this be for the Elects sake only,
and to convey that Power to them, to what use
doth it stand to others? If the Elect did dwell
alone, and were a distinct Community among
themselves, the Objection were plausible; but
they are hidden among others: Therefore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates
are called <hi>obiter,</hi> by the <hi>by,</hi> as others are
called according to purpose; and therefore they
have the Benefit of the common Call, and the
common Offer. The World stands for the Elects
sake, yet others have the Benefit of the World,
and worldly Things. So the Word is preached
for the Elects sake, yet others have the Benefit
of an external Call. The Sun shines, tho blind
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:47528:154"/>
Men see it not. The Rain falls upon Rocks and
Mountains, as well as fruitful Valleys: So God
may suffer these Exhortations to light upon wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Men. And again, as to them, it is for their
Conviction, it is to bridle their Corruptions; it is at
least a means to civilize them, and keep them from
growing worse: Therefore such kind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Persuasions restrain their Wickedness.
Therefore it stands well enough with the Wisdom
of the Law-giver, to call upon Men, and invite
them, with Promises and Threatnings, to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Therefore now let me shew, How doth God
reduce and frame our Hearts to the Obedience of
his Will? The Ways God useth are of two sorts,
Moral and Real.</p>
               <p>1. God works <hi>morally,</hi> so as to preserve Man's
Nature, and the Principles thereof; therefore
he works by sweet Inclination, not with Violence.
So he comes with Blandishments, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Words; <hi>Hos. 2. 14. I will allure her, and
bring her into the Wilderness, and speak comfortably
unto her.</hi> So, Gen. 9. 27. <hi>The Lord shall persuade</hi>
Japhet, <hi>and he shall dwell in the Tents of</hi> Shem.
By fair and kindly Words, he draweth on Men
to the liking of the Gospel. He offereth no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to our natural Principles, but to our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.
God doth not make the Will to be <hi>no</hi>
Will, but to be a <hi>good</hi> Will; He restoreth the
Faculties to their right Use and Exercise; He
layeth forth the Beauty and Excellency of his
Grace, and a glorious Estate he sets before our
Eyes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o out-bids Temptation, and draweth
our Hearts to himself. And God not only doth
work suitably to our general Nature, as we are
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47528:154"/>
reasonable Creatures, but suitably to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Frame of the Heart. Some are of a stout
and stubborn Temper, and will not be subdued
by <hi>milder</hi> Means and Motives; therefore God
breaks them with Fears and Terrors, and with a
Spirit of Conviction: And others, he draws
them on by Love, and by a gentle Application.</p>
               <p>That God hath respect to Mens particular
Tempers, was figured in those extraordinary
Ways of Appearance and Manifestation; they
are fitted according to the State of Men. To
<hi>Moses</hi> that was a Shepherd, and was acquainted
with Bushes, God appears in a Bush of Fire:
And to the Wise Men, that were skill'd in the
Motions of the heavenly Bodies, he appears in a
Star. And to <hi>Peter,</hi> that was a Fisherman, he
appears to him, and shews his Power first in the
Draught of Fishes. So still these are Pledges of
this kind of Dispensation, that God will work
suitably not only to our general Nature, as Men,
but to our particular State and Temper. Yea,
yet further, to set on this moral Way of working,
there is a fit Subordination of the Circumstances
of Providence. God <hi>takes the wild Asses in their
Month;</hi> and he hath his Season wherein to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rts of Sinners. <hi>Prov. 25. 11. A
Word fitly spoken, is like Apples of Gold in Pictures
of Silver.</hi> God comes in in a fit Season; as when
a Soul is humbled by some sudden Accident: As
one was converted, by seeing a Man fall down
dead suddenly by him. God ordereth some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
to work, and awaken the Hearts of Men.
Or else by some great Affliction. <hi>Hos. 2. 14. I
will bring her into the Wilderness, and speak comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
unto her.</hi> God finds many a Sinner in the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:47528:155"/>
Briars, as <hi>Abraham</hi> found the Lamb. Stubborn
Humors are then most broken. Metal in the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
is capable of any Form. God may suit and
dispose us so, that he may come in in a fit season
to the Soul. Or in Terrors of Conscience, when
the Heart is scourged with remorse for great Sins.
All this is God's moral Work.</p>
               <p>2. There is a <hi>real</hi> Work, which goes along
with this Persuasion; there is an Almighty Power:
For bare Persuasion cannot make the Blind to see,
the Dead to live, or open the Heart of Man, that
is so desperately and obstinately wicked, until he
puts his Fingers upon the Holes of the Lock, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he begins to open the Heart.</p>
               <p>Concerning this real Work, observe, it is <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi>
yet <hi>thorow and prevailing,</hi> so as the Effect
doth follow, when God will convert. The exact
Manner of God's drawing is unknown; <hi>Austin</hi>
calls it an inward, hidden, and unspeakable
Power, which God putteth forth together with
the Word; it is marvellous in our Eyes; but he
that knew how to creat Souls, knows how to
work upon them. This Power, it is like the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of the Heavens, which so insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the Operation of second Causes, that
they cannot be seen: so there is such a mighty
Power working in us, tho we cannot tell how to
express it. We cannot say there is no such Power,
because we do not know what it is.</p>
               <p>And as this Power is secret, so when this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is put forth, it is <hi>prevailing;</hi> he works pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailingly,
so as the Effect must necessarily follow.
The Grace God gives to Men, to convert them,
it is not a Power to be converted, repent, and
believe, if they will; no, but he gives Repentance,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:47528:155"/>
he gives Faith, and works so as the Effect shall
succeed: He works efficaciously and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,
so as to oppose all the Resistance of the
Will, and accomplish his Work.</p>
               <p>That's the first Branch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> When we are thus framed by Grace,
after Conversion God still concurreth, and must
help us to do his Will. He doth not only give us
the Habit of Grace, but actual Help in the Work
of Obedience. <hi>Isa. 26. 12. Thou hast wrought all
our Works in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why is it that still the Lord worketh in us,
both to will and to do, unto the last; and not
only begins with us, but still keeps Grace in his
own hands, so as we shall have our Supplies from
Heaven from day to day?</p>
               <p>There are several Reasons:</p>
               <p>1. Because it endeareth God to a gracious Soul.
The more Visits we have from God, and the
more he is mindful of us at every turn, the more
is God endeared to us. In such a Duty, there
we met with Comfort and Enlargement, because
God was there; that is noted and regarded, so
that the Lord is rendred the more precious. The
Experiment we have of God in every Duty, doth
the more make us prize his Grace. As <hi>David,</hi>
Psal. 119. 93. <hi>I will never forget thy Precepts; for
with them thou hast quickned me.</hi> I shall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
such a Sermon, and such a Prayer, because
there I met with God. So in Affliction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3.
<hi>Patience worketh Experience;</hi> or in such a Conflict,
we had such a Support; this endeareth God to
the Soul. As mutual Acts of Kindness do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Friendship between Man and Man; so do
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:47528:156"/>
these renewed Acts of Love, and of God's Care
and Kindness over us, maintain a Friendship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and us.</p>
               <p>2. It engageth us to a constant Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, and Communion with him. It is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
which maintains the Commerce between
Heaven and Earth. Now if we did keep the
Stock our selves, God and we should soon grow
Strangers. When the Prodigal had his Portion
in his own hands, he goes out of his Father's
House, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. The Throne of Grace would
lie neglected and unfrequented, if we did not
stand in need of daily Receivings; when would
the Lord hear from us? And therefore to oblige
us to a constant Dependance, God will keep the
Grace in his own hands, that ever we may have
something to drive us to himself, some Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
upon us, for the Throne of Grace is for a
Time of Need, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
               <p>3. This is that which keeps us <hi>humble;</hi> and
that upon several Considerations. All we have,
'tis by Gift; and then what can we be proud of?
Not only the Habits of Grace themselves, but
also those actual Incitements, which are necessary
to draw them forth into Act. So that of all our
Excellencies we may say, Alas! 'tis but borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and if we be proud of them, we are but
proud we are more in Debt than others; when
most enlarged, and most assisted, it is from God.
We would laugh, if a Groom should be proud of
his Master's Horse, and his Master's Cloak: Shall
we usurp that Honour that is due to God? <hi>What
hast thou that thou didst not receive?</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 7.
And then we have it from Hand to Mouth. That
which we have received, will not bear us out,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:47528:156"/>
unless God come in with new Influences of Grace.
We should soon grow proud, if God did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
us, and give out the renewed Evidences of
his Love day after day. And we should not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
our Benefactor, if God should do all
at once; therefore he lesseneth and weakneth our
Corruptions by degrees, and by the renewed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of his Grace. And by this means we are
made sensible of the Mutability of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
God left <hi>Hezekiah, to try him, that he might
know all that was in his Heart.</hi> 2 Chron. 32. 31.
God hath so dispensed Grace, that he will be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and coming as to actual Influence; therefore
sometimes he will leave us, that he may disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Man to himself. Tho we have Grace plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in our Hearts, and are renewed, yet if God
leave us, how weak and foolish are we! We are
renewed, but not fully recovered of that Maim
and Bruise we got by the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and we
cannot do as we will. If God withdraw his Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
his Strength, secret Corruption will break
forth, and our Indisposition to holy Things will
soon appear.</p>
               <p>4. Then it is for the Honor of the <hi>Lord's
Grace.</hi> It doth abundantly provide for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Grace, that from first to last we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to God; not only for those permanent
and fixed Habits, which constitute the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but for those daily Supplies, without which
the Motions of the Spirit are at a stand. And
this is that which makes the Saints still to put the
Crown upon Grace's Head. When the Servants
gave an Account of improving of their Talents,
saith one of them, <hi>Luke 19. 16. Lord, thy Pound
hath gained ten Pounds:</hi> He doth not say, <hi>My In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:47528:157"/>
but, <hi>Thy Pound.</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>I
live;</hi> yea, but he interposeth presently, <hi>Yet not
I, but Christ liveth in me.</hi> They are ever ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
all to God, because they see they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without him. When we come to Heaven,
'tis a Question which we shall admire most, <hi>Grace,</hi>
or <hi>Glory;</hi> the Glory of that Estate into which
we are brought; or else Grace, which was the
Foundation of it. O when we see all that was
done and suffered for God, it was from God:
<hi>Of thine own have we given thee.</hi> How will the
Soul admire the Riches of his glorious Grace!
We have not only traded with his Money, but by
his Direction; and when our Stock was imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell'd,
he supplied us at every turn. For these
Ends the Lord still keeps Grace in his own hands,
that we can do nothing to any purpose, unless he
be pleased to concur, by the Influences and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of his own Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VSE.</hi> The Use shall only be in these two
Branches.</p>
               <p>1. In doing any good Work, let us do all
things in him, as well as to him. Let us not only
make this our Scope, that we may do it to God;
but let us make his Grace our Principle: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
when we go to work for God, without
God, it will befall us, as it did <hi>Sampson,</hi> that
thought to go out and shake himself, as in former
time, but his Locks were cut, and his Strength
gone. Men that have had former Experiences,
think to find a like Vigor of Affection, a like Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
of Spirit, a like Savoriness of Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but if they take not God along with them,
they find their Strength is gone, their Affections
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:47528:157"/>
dead, that all their Spirits are dry and sapless,
and that they do not go forth with such Life and
Power as formerly. Therefore when ever you
go about a good Work, say, as <hi>David, I will go
forth in the Strength of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It directs us in ascribing the Honour of what
we have done. It is dangerous to assume Divine
Honour to our selves, or accept it from others;
but we must give the Lord the Glory, whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
doth all the Work. Remember, we
have received all from God, and God must have
all the Glory and Honour. If others should ascribe
it to us, we are not to take it. To conceal and
receive stollen Goods, brings us within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of Theft, as well as to steal them our selves.
So, when others would ascribe any thing to us,
still let the Lord have the Glory of every Work
and Business.</p>
               <p>The third Point.</p>
               <p>Doct. 3. <hi>We are not only to look to this, that his
Will be done, but to the Manner how it is
done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not for the Honour of his Majesty, to be
put off with any thing; we must serve him with
all our Mind and Strength. <hi>Mal. 1. 14. When ye
brought that which was torn, and lame, and sick;
should I accept this of your Hands? saith the Lord.
I am a great King, saith the Lord of Hosts, and my
Name is dreadful among the Heathen.</hi> We are to
aim at the highest manner of serving God. There
is an ardent Desire in the Saints to be perfect: <hi>If
by any means they would attain to the Resurrection of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:47528:158"/>
the Dead.</hi> Phil. 3. 11. That is, that happy and
sinless State they shall enjoy hereafter. The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is more considerable than the Work it self.
A Man may sin in doing <hi>good,</hi> but he cannot sin
in doing <hi>well;</hi> therefore the Manner is that which
is mainly stood upon in Scripture. God doth not
only look that we pray, but it must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervent
effectual Prayer, not a drousy Devotion; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that we hear, but take heed how we hear;
not only that we serve him, but serve him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly;
not only run, but so run. The great
thing that is put into the Ballance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
when God comes to weigh the Actions of
Men, what doth he consider? He weighs the
Spirits; <hi>Prov. 16. 2. All the Ways of Man are
right in his own Eyes; but the Lord weigheth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:</hi>
That is, he considers vvith vvhat frame of
Heart, and in vvhat manner vve go about any
thing vve do for him. And therefore this is the
main thing vve should look after, in what manner
we serve him; even as the Angels do in Heaven;
not in an ordinary, but perfect manner.</p>
               <p>But wherein doth the Resemblance hold? How
should we be as the Angels?</p>
               <p>1. In conformity to the Angels, we must serve
God <hi>readily.</hi> The Angels are represented as <hi>with
Wings,</hi> Isa. 6. 2. And the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> is said
to <hi>flie swiftly</hi> upon God's Message. They are
hearkning for God's Word, and go on God's
Errand. So we should be ready and speedy in
our Obedience. <hi>Psal. 119. 60. I made haste, and
delayed not to keep thy Commandments.</hi> It is not
enough to keep God's Commandments, but vve
must make haste, (that is) before the strength
of the present Impulsion be lost, and those
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:47528:158"/>
Fervors which are upon us be cool'd.</p>
               <p>2. Willingly and chearfully, and without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring.
Angels are ready at God's beck; they
are ministring Spirits, even to the meanest Saints;
God hath sent them abroad for the Heirs of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
they are as Guardians to them, to look
after them in all their Ways. The Devils, what
Christ bids them do, do it murmuringly; the
unclean Spirit would not come out without ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and tearing, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. Christ's presence
was a Burthen to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. When we do
things with reluctancy, murmuringly, we are
more like the Devil, than the Angels. When
the Devils obey his Word, they are forced to it
by the absolute Power of Christ; yet they do it
not with Willingness and Freeness, as the good
Angels do. But we are to do it freely: <hi>I delight
to do thy Will, O my God.</hi> Psal. 40. 8. And, <hi>Iohn
4. 34. It is my Meat and Drink, to do the Will of
him that sent me.</hi> That was the Dish Christ
loved.</p>
               <p>3. Constantly and unweariedly. Thus do the
Angels in Heaven. The Devils, they abode not
in the Truth; but Angels, they do it without
weariness; they rest not Day nor Night, but
are still lauding, praising, and serving God, and
are never weary. God in Communion is ever
new and fresh to them; the Face of their heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father is as lovely as at first moment; no
Weariness or Satiety creeps upon those good
Spirits. Thus should we do it, without Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and then we shall reap, if we faint not.</p>
               <p>4. Faithfully, not picking and chusing: <hi>They
hearken to the Voice of his Word,</hi> whatever it be,
be it to ascend or descend: So we, if it be to go
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:47528:159"/>
backward for God, tho it be against the Bent of
our Hearts. <hi>David</hi> is said to be a <hi>Man after God's
Heart,</hi> because <hi>he did all God's Will.</hi> Acts 13. 22.
All which should be a Patern for us, and we
should strive to come up to it.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Give us this day our daily Bread.</head>
               <p>WE are now come to the second sort of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
that concern our selves, as the
former did more immediately concern God. Now
you may observe the Stile in the Prayer is altered:
It was before, <hi>Thy Name, Thy Kingdom, Thy Will;</hi>
now it is, <hi>Give us,</hi> and <hi>forgive us,</hi> &amp;c. Before,
our Lord had taught us to speak in a third Person,
<hi>Thy Will be done;</hi> and now in a second Person,
<hi>Give us this day.</hi> Which is not so to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
as if we were not at all concern'd in the
former part of the Lord's Prayer. In those Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
the Benefit is not God's, but ours. When
his Name is sanctified, his Kingdom cometh, and
his Will is done; these Things do not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Glory of God, but also our Benefit. It
is our Advantage, when God is honoured by the
Coming of Christ's Kingdom, and the Subjection
of our Hearts unto himself. But these latter Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
do more immediatly concern us. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
these, in the first place, we pray for the
necessary Provisions of the present Life. Some
make a scruple, why such a Prayer should be put
in the first place? Surely, not to shew the Value
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:47528:159"/>
of these Things above Pardon and Grace; but
this is the last of the Supplications. The Lord's
Prayer may be divided into Supplications and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations.
Among the Supplications, there we
pray'd, first, for the <hi>Glory</hi> of God; next, for
the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God; next, for our <hi>Subjection</hi> to
that Kingdom; and in the last place, we pray
for daily Bread, or Sustentation of the present
Life. But the other two are Deprecations; and
that either of Evil <hi>already committed;</hi> and so we
pray for Pardon of Sin, <hi>Forgive us our Trespasses:</hi>
Or Deprecation of Evil that is likely to be <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;</hi>
and so we pray against Temptation, <hi>Lead
us not into Temptation.</hi> So that this Request is put
into a fit Order: First, we seek God's Glory, as
the End; his Kingdom, as the primary Means;
our Subjection to that Kingdom, as the next
Means; and last of all, our comfortable Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the World, as a remote subservient Help,
that we may be in a capacity to serve and glorify
God.</p>
               <p>In this Petition there is,</p>
               <p>I. The Thing asked, and that is <hi>Bread,</hi> by
which is meant all Things necessary for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance

us freely and graciously the good Things of
this Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is Bread we ask, and we ask it of God, and
to God we say, <hi>Give:</hi> All which Circumstances
do fully make out the Point.</p>
               <p>This Point again must be made good by parts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That God giveth it.</item>
                  <item>2. That he freely and graciously giveth it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First; I shall shew you how God is interested
in the common Mercies we do enjoy; and how
every one, high or low, rich or poor, full or in
a mean Condition, of what rank soever they be,
even those that have the greatest Store and Plenty
of worldly Accommodations, they must come
from Morning to Morning, and deal with God
for daily Bread.</p>
               <p>Those common Mercies which we do enjoy,</p>
               <p>1. God gives us the <hi>Possession</hi> of them; for he is
the absolute Lord of all Things, both in Heaven
and in Earth; and whatsoever is possessed by any
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:47528:160"/>
Creature, it is by his Indulgence; for the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and original Right was in him. <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 1.
<hi>The Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulness thereof; the
World, and they that dwell therein.</hi> It is all God's,
we hold it in Fee from him; for he is the great
Landlord, who hath leased out all these Blessings
to the Sons of Men. The Earth is first the Lord's,
and then by a Grant he hath given it to Men to
enjoy. <hi>Psal. 115. 16. The Heaven, even the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
are the Lord's; but the Earth hath he given to
the Children of Men.</hi> He hath given it to Men,
partly, by a <hi>general</hi> Grant, and Leave given to
enjoy and occupy it, as the Place of our Service:
But that is not all; he doth not only give the
Earth in general to Men, but he makes a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Allotment;</hi> the particular Designation of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man's Portion of what he shall enjoy in tho
World, it is of God. And so it is said, <hi>Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
17. 26. He hath determined the Bounds of their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.</hi>
God hath not only appointed in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
the Earth to be the Place of our Service for
a while; but he hath determined how much eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one shall possess, what shall fall to his Share.
These Things come not by Chance, or by the
Gift of others, or by our own Industry, but by
the peculiar Designation of God's Providence.
However they come to us, God must be owned in
the Possession; whether they come to us by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Purchase, Labour, or by Inheritance;
yet they are originally by God, who (by these
means) bestoweth them upon us. If they come
by Donation, or the Gift of others; the Hearts
of Men are in God's hands, and he it was that
disposed them to be bountiful to us, that appoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to be Instruments of his Providence, to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:47528:161"/>
nourish us. He that sends a Present, he is the
Giver, not the Servant which brings it: So,
though others be imployed as Instruments, it is
the Lord which made them able and willing to
do us good. If they come to us by <hi>Inheritance,</hi>
it is the Providence of God that a Man is born of
rich Friends, and not of Beggars: <hi>Prov. 22. 2. The
rich and poor meet together; the Lord is the Maker of
them all:</hi> He that hath cast the World first into
Hills and Valleys, it was he that disposed of Men,
some into a high, and some into a low Condition.
If they come to us by our own <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase,</hi>
still God gave it to us: <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 14, 18.
<hi>Take heed that thine Heart be not lifted up, and thou
forget the Lord thy God; for it is he that giveth thee
Power to get Wealth.</hi> He doth not leave second
Causes to their own Power and Force, as if he
were only an idle Spectator in the World: No, he
gives the Skill and Industry to manage Affairs, and
success upon lawful Undertakings; the Faculty,
and the use it is all from God: Tho a Man hath
never so many outward Advantages, yet unless the
Lord concur with his Blessing, all would be to no
purpose.</p>
               <p>2. As God gives us the Possession, so he gives
us a <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to them. There is a two-fold
Right to these common Blessings; a <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntial,</hi>
and a <hi>Covenant</hi>-Right: <hi>Dominium Politicum
fundatur in Providentia,</hi> our <hi>Civil</hi> Right to things is
sounded upon God's <hi>Providence:</hi> But <hi>Dominium
Evangelicum fundatur in Gratia;</hi> our <hi>Gospel</hi>-Right
to things is founded upon God's <hi>Grace.</hi> (1.) He
gives the <hi>Providential</hi> Right; and thus all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Men possess outward things, and the Plenty
they enjoy is as the Fruits and Gifts of God's
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:47528:161"/>
common Bounty, it is their Portion, he hath given
it to them; <hi>Psal. 17. 14. Which have their Portion
in this Life:</hi> whatever falleth to their share in a
fair way, and in the course of God's Providence;
they are not Usurpers meerly for <hi>possessing,</hi> but
for <hi>abusing</hi> what they have. They have not only
a <hi>Civil Right</hi> by the Laws of <hi>Men,</hi> to prevent the
Incroachment of others; but a <hi>Providential</hi> Right
before <hi>God;</hi> and are not simply responsible for
Possession, but for their ill Use and Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
(2.) There's a <hi>Covenant</hi>-Right to these
Blessings: so only <hi>Believers</hi> have a Right to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Comforts
by God's special Love; and so,
(<hi>That a little that a righteous Man hath, is better
than the Treasures of many wicked:</hi> Psal. 37.
16.) as the mean Fare of a poor Subject, is better
then the large Allowance of a condemned Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
Every wicked Man is a Traitor to God,
and hath only an Allowance until he be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But that little which a Man hath, seasoned
with God's Love, is better than all the mighty
Increase of wicked Men. Now this Covenant-
Right we have by Christ, who is <hi>Heir of all things;
Heb.</hi> 1. 2. Christ hath the <hi>Original</hi>-Right: to them,
and we by him come to have a <hi>Covenant</hi>-Right:
So it is said, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 23. Things present, and things
to come, all are yours.</hi> As things to come, the Day
of Judgment is theirs; so things present is theirs
by a <hi>new Title</hi> from him: So it is said, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5.
Marriage, Meats and Drinks, and all Creatures
are made for them that believe. They that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
have only a Gospel-Right to them. To
draw it to the present thing; we do not only
beg a <hi>Possession</hi> of these things, but a <hi>Right;</hi> not
only a <hi>Providential,</hi> but a <hi>Covenant</hi>-Right, that
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:47528:162"/>
we may enjoy them as the Gifts of God's fatherly
Love and Compassion to us; that we may take
our Bread out of Christ's Hands, that we may
look upon it as swimming to us in his Blood,
and all our Mercies as wrapt up in his Bowels;
and then they will be sweet, and relish much
better with a gracious Soul, because he cannot
only taste the Creature, but the Love of God in
the Creature.</p>
               <p>3. He gives the <hi>Continuance</hi> of our Blessings,
that we may keep what we have; for unless the
Lord do daily support us, we cannot keep our
Comforts for one day. How soon can God blast
them? It's at his pleasure to do what he will
with you: He gave Satan Power over <hi>Iob</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
<hi>Chap. 1. 12. Behold all that he hath is in thy
Power.</hi> Our Life it is continued to us by the
Indulgence of God, and by his providential In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
and Supportation. For as the Beams of
the Sun are no longer continued in the Air than
the Sun shineth; or, as the Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er retains the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
and Stamp no longer than the Seal is kept
on it; so when God takes off his providential
Influence, all vanisheth into nothing. Thus he is
said, <hi>Heb. 1. 3. To uphold all things by the Word
of his Power:</hi> As a weighty thing is upheld in the
Hand of a Man, when he looseneth his Hand all
falls to the Ground: So it is said, <hi>Iob 12. 10. In
whose Hand is the Soul of every living Thing, and the
Breath of all Mankind.</hi> God by his Almighty
Grasp holdeth all things in his own Hands, and
if he should but let loose his Hand, all would fall to
nothing, and disappear; <hi>Iob.</hi> 6. 9. For it is from
the intimate Support and Influence of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that we have our Lives. So our <hi>Comforts,</hi>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:47528:162"/>
they are continued to us by God; alas, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
they are poor fugacious things! <hi>Haman</hi>
was to day high in Honour, and to morrow high
upon the Gallows. <hi>Riches make themselves Wings,
and flie away as an Eagle towards Heaven:</hi> Prov.
23. 5. The Holy-Ghost seems there to compare
Riches to a Flock of Birds, which pitcheth in a
Man's Field to Night, but to Morrow they are
gone: Who is the richer for a Flock of wild
Fowls, because they pitch in his Field now? So
all these outward things are so flying, that they
are soon gone by many Accidents, unless he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
them, and continues our Possession of them.
For God he can give a Charge and Commission
to the Fire, to the Fury of Men, one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to deprive us of these things. <hi>Behold, all he
hath is in thy Hands:</hi> Job 1. 12. When a Man
hath gotten abundance of worldly Comforts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, and seemeth to be intrenched and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
against all Hazards; the Man is taken
away, and cannot enjoy what he had heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with a great deal of Care and Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>4. We beg <hi>leave</hi> to <hi>use</hi> them. It is good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in Religion, to ask God's leave in all things.
It is Robbery to make use of a Man's Goods, and
to waste and consume them without his leave.
We must ask God leave upon this account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
tho God gives these good things to Men,
yet he still reserves the Property in himself; for
by distributing Blessings to the Creature, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended to devest himself of the Right. As a
Husbandman, by scattering his Corn in the Field
did not dispossess himself, but still keeps a Right,
and means to have the Increase. So when the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:47528:163"/>
Lord scattereth his Blessings, we only receive them
as Stewards, not as Owners and Proprietors;
God still is the Supream Lord, and only hath the
Property and Dominion. In <hi>Life</hi> it is clear,
Man is not <hi>Dominus Vits,</hi> but <hi>Custos,</hi> not <hi>Lord</hi> of
his Life, but only the <hi>Steward</hi> and Guardian of
it; he cannot live or die at his own Pleasure:
if a Man kills himself, he runs the danger
of God's Law. What is said of Life, is true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of his <hi>Estate,</hi> he is not an <hi>Owner</hi> so much as a
<hi>Steward,</hi> that's the Notion of our Possession; we
are Stewards, and must render an account to
God: <hi>Hosea 2. 9. I will return and take away</hi> my
<hi>Corn in the time thereof, and</hi> my <hi>Wine in the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thereof, and will recover</hi> my <hi>Wooll and</hi> my <hi>Flax.</hi>
Though God hath communicated these things to
the Children of Men, yet he hath reserved the
Dominion in his own Hands: So <hi>Hag. 2. 8. The
Silver is mine, and the Gold is mine, saith the Lord
of Hosts.</hi> He never disposed any thing so into
the Creatures Hands, but still he hath reserved
a Right and Interest in it; and therefore it is,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 19. that the Lord is not only called the
<hi>Creator</hi> of Heaven and Earth, but <hi>Possessor</hi> of
Heaven and Earth. He is not only the Possessor
of <hi>Heaven</hi> where he dwells, which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to his <hi>own</hi> use; but he is Possessor of <hi>Earth,</hi>
which he hath committed to the use of <hi>Men.</hi> And
God will have his Right acknowledged from day
to day.</p>
               <p>5. It is he that giveth us <hi>Ability</hi> to use them:
We beg, that we may not only have the Comforts,
but <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> to use them; for God can
blast us in the very midst of our Enjoyments.
It is the case of many, when they have hunted
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:47528:163"/>
after a worldly Portion, and begin to think, now
I will sit down and enjoy it; when the Gain is
come into his Hands, and he thinks to waste that
which he hath got in hunting, Death takes him
away, and he hath not power to use them. Thus
it was with the rich Fool, when he began to sing
Lullabies to his Soul, and enjoy what he had got,
he is taken away by Death; <hi>Luke 12. 20. Thou
Fool, this Night thy Soul shall be required of thee;
then whose shall those things be which thou hast provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?</hi>
And it is said, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 33. when those
People had gotten Quails: <hi>That while the Flesh
was yet between their Teeth, ere it was chewed; the
Wrath of the Lord was kindled against the People, and
the Lord smote them with a very great Plague.</hi> And
that Noble Man which saw Plenty in <hi>Samaria,</hi>
but could not taste of it; 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 19. So <hi>Iob
21. 23. One dieth in his full Strength, being wholly
at ease and quiet:</hi> When he has gotten abundance
of worldly Comforts about him, Death seizes on
him of a sudden.</p>
               <p>6. God yet is further interested in these Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
so as to give us a <hi>sanctified</hi> use of them, that
we may take our Bread out of God's Hands with
Prayer, and Thanksgiving, and due Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God: In 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 5. Every Creature of
God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with Thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the
Word of God and Prayer.</hi> Then are the Creatures
<hi>sanctified</hi> to us, when we enjoy <hi>God</hi> in them;
when our Hearts are raised to think of the <hi>Donor,</hi>
and can <hi>love</hi> him the more for every Gift. Carnal
Men, like Swine, raven upon the Acorns, but look
not up to the Oak from whence they drop. In
the <hi>Canticles,</hi> the Spouses Eyes are compared to
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:47528:164"/>
                  <hi>Doves</hi> Eyes. They which make the Allusion, say
this is the meaning; look as a Dove pecks, and
looks upward; so upon every grain of Mercy, we
should look up to the God of Mercies: It is not
enough to <hi>taste</hi> the <hi>sweet</hi> of the Creatures, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to <hi>own God,</hi> his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Bounty</hi> in them, so to
have them sanctified to us. This is the Priviledg
we have as <hi>Men,</hi> that we can <hi>know</hi> the first Cause,
and who is the Benefactor: All Creatures <hi>subsist</hi>
upon the first Cause, but are not capable of
knowing it. And this is our Priviledg, as <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
to have this Capacity reduced into <hi>Act.</hi> It
is of the Lord's Grace to give us a sanctified use
of these things.</p>
               <p>7. We beg of God the <hi>natural Blessing</hi> upon
the holy Use of outward Comforts, so as they
may continue us in <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Vigor</hi> for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God; for nothing will prosper with us
but by his Blessing: <hi>Psal. 106. 15. He gave them
their Request, but sent Leanness into their Souls:</hi>
that is, they had no natural Comfort by that
which they had obtained. God may give a Man
<hi>Meat,</hi> yet not an <hi>Appetite;</hi> he may not give him
the <hi>comfortable</hi> use of it, a <hi>Blessing</hi> with it. And
therefore the Apostle makes it to be an Argument
of God's Bounty to the Heathen, that as he gave
them <hi>Food,</hi> so he gave them <hi>Gladness</hi> of <hi>Heart:</hi>
Acts 14. 17. <hi>He gave them Rain from Heaven, and
fruitful Seasons, filling their Hearts with Food and
Gladness:</hi> that is, gave them a <hi>comfortable</hi> use, a
<hi>Blessing</hi> upon the use of outward things. And
<hi>Levit.</hi> 26. you will find a Distinction between
<hi>Bread,</hi> and the <hi>Staff</hi> of Bread: we may have <hi>Bread,</hi>
yet not the <hi>Staff</hi> of Bread. Many have worldly
Comforts, but not with a natural Blessing: <hi>Eccles.</hi>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:47528:164"/>
3. 13. <hi>That every Man should eat and drink, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the Good of all his Labour, it is the Gift of God:</hi>
not only that he should have <hi>Increase</hi> by his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
but enjoy <hi>Good;</hi> to have the comfortable
use of that Increase.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Contentation</hi> is one of God's Blessings that
we ask in this Prayer [<hi>Give us this day our daily
Bread.</hi>] That is, such Provisions as are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for us, Contentment and quiet of Mind in the
Enjoyment; <hi>Ioel 2. 19. Behold, I will send you Corn,
and Wine, and Oil, and ye shall be</hi> satisfied <hi>therewith.</hi>
It is not only a <hi>Blessing</hi> we should look after, but
<hi>Contentment,</hi> that our Minds may be suited to our
Condition, for then the Creature is more sweet
and comfortable to us. The Happiness of Man
doth not lie in his <hi>Abundance,</hi> but in the Suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his <hi>Mind</hi> to his <hi>Estate.</hi> Luk. 12. 15. <hi>A Man's
Life consisteth not in the abundance of things which he
possesseth.</hi> There's a twofold War within a Man,
both which must be taken up before a Man can
have Comfort; there's a War between a <hi>Man</hi>
and his <hi>Conscience,</hi> and this breeds trouble of
Mind; and there's a War between his <hi>Affections</hi>
and his <hi>Condition,</hi> and this breeds murmuring and
envious repining: Say, <hi>Yea, Lord, and let us be
contented with thy Gift.</hi> This for the first thing,
how God is concerned in these outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> That the Lord doth <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi>
give these good things to us, (that is) meerly
out of his Bounty and Goodness. It is not from
his strict remunerative <hi>Iustice,</hi> but out of his
<hi>Grace.</hi> The very Air we breath in, the Bread
we eat, our common Blessings, be they never so
mean, we have them all from Grace, and all
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:47528:165"/>
from the tender Mercy of the Lord. <hi>Psal.</hi> 136.
25. you have there the Story of the notable
Effects of God's Mercy, and he concludes it thus:
<hi>Who giveth Food to all Flesh: for his Mercy endureth
for ever.</hi> Mark, the Psalmist doth not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
those <hi>mighty Victories,</hi> those <hi>glorious Instances</hi>
of his Love and Power, to his unchangeable Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but our <hi>daily Bread.</hi> In <hi>eminent</hi> Deliverances
of the Church we will acknowledg Mercy; Yea,
but we should do it in every bit of Meat we eat,
for the same Reason is rendred all along. What's
the reason his People smote <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites,</hi>
and <hi>Og</hi> the King of <hi>Bashan,</hi> and rescued his
People so often out of danger? (<hi>For his Mercy
endureth for ever.</hi>) And what's the reason he
giveth Food to all Flesh? (<hi>For his Mercy endureth
for ever.</hi>) It's not only Mercy which gives us
Christ, and Salvation by Christ, and all those
glorious Deliverances and Triumphs over the
Enemies of the Church; but it's Mercy which
furnisheth our Tables, it is Mercy that we taste
with our Mouths, and wear at our Backs. It is
notable, our Lord Jesus, when there were but
five Barley Loaves, and two Fishes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 11.
<hi>He lift up his Eyes and gave Thanks.</hi> Though our
Provision be never so homely and slender, yet
God's Grace and Mercy must be acknowledged.</p>
               <p>But to evidence this by some Considerations;
that certainly it is of the Mercy of the Lord,
that he giveth Bread to the Creature: God
giveth these Mercies.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To those that <hi>cannot</hi> return any Service
to him.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:47528:165"/>
2. To those that <hi>will</hi> not return any Service
to him.</item>
                  <item>3. When we are at our best, we cannot <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi>
them.</item>
                  <item>4. We deserve the quite <hi>contrary.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1. He giveth these Mercies to those that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
return any Service to him. The Beasts, and
Fowls of the Air, the young Ravens: <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.
16. <hi>Thou openest thy Hand, and satisfiest the Desire
of every living thing.</hi> What can the Beasts, or
Fishes, or Fowls of the Air deserve at God's
Hand? what Honour and Service can they bring
to him? only they have a bountiful Creator,
from whom they receive their Allowance.</p>
               <p>So as to <hi>Infants,</hi> alas, what can they deserve
at his Hand? when God rocks their Cradles,
and nourisheth them from the Dug; what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
can they do to God? <hi>Isa. 46. 3, 4. By me,</hi>
saith the Lord, <hi>You are born from the Belly, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
from the Womb, and even to your old Age, I am
he, and even to hoare Hairs will I carry you:</hi> Mark,
not only in <hi>Old Age,</hi> when we have done God
Service, doth he maintain us; but from the
<hi>Womb,</hi> the <hi>Belly,</hi> before we could do any thing
for him, we were tenderly handled by him. He
alludeth to Parents and Nurses, which carry their
Younglings in their Arms. In Infancy we are not
in a Capacity to know the God of our Mercies, and
look after him; yet he looked after us then, when
we could not perform one act of Love and Kindness
to him. The Psalmist takes notice of this; <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.
9. 10. <hi>Thou art he that took me out of the Womb; thou
didst make me hope, when I was upon my Mother's Breast. I
was cast upon thee from the Womb, thou art my God from
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:47528:166"/>
my Mother's Belly.</hi> Christians, before ever you
could do any thing for him, or your selves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you could improve his Mercy, when you
could not know who was your Benefactor, who
it was that nourished and cherished you, yet
then God rocked your Cradles, kept you from
many Dangers, nursed you, and brought you up,
and carried you in the tender Arms of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>2. God gives these Mercies to those that <hi>will</hi>
not serve him when they <hi>can:</hi> Isa. 1. 2. <hi>I have
nourished and brought up Children, and they have
rebelled against me.</hi> There are many in the World
whom God protects, supplies, and provides them
of all Necessaries, yet they return nothing but
Disobedience, Contempt, Rebellion, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulness.
The Sun doth not shine by chance,
but at God's disposal: <hi>Mat. 5. 45. He makes his
Sun to rise on the Evil, and on the Good; and sendeth
Rain on the Iust, and on the Vnjust.</hi> Most of those
which are fed at God's Table, and maintained
at his Expence and Care, they are his Enemies:
and many times the more Men receive from him,
the worse they are. Look as Beasts towards
Man, when they are in good plight they grow
fierce, and are ready to destroy those which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
them: so, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> are plentifully supplied,
we kick with the Heel, wax wanton, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of God. Or, as a froward Child scratcheth the
Breast which suckles it; so we rebel against God
that nourished us, and brought us up, and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
our heavenly Father that provides these
Blessings for us. <hi>Parisiensis</hi> hath a saying, They
which hold the greatest Farms, many times pay
the least Rent: so the great ones of the World,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:47528:166"/>
they which have most of God's Bounty, give
him the least Acknowledgment.</p>
               <p>3. When we do our <hi>best,</hi> we cannot <hi>deserve</hi>
these Mercies, or merit ought at God's Hands;
for all we do is already due to God, as we are his
Creatures; and the paying new Debts will not
quit old Scores. The Question is propounded,
<hi>Iob 22. 2. Can a Man be profitable unto God, as he
that is wise may be profitable unto himself?</hi> See the
Answer, <hi>Chap. 35. 7. If thou be righteous, what
givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine Hand?</hi>
and wherein is God profited, if a Man's ways be
perfect? And therefore what ever God doth for
Creatures, he doth it freely, because he cannot be
obliged by any Act of ours, and pre-ingaged.
Thus <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency could not obtain the
Blessing, but by virtue of the Covenant, nor merit
ought at God's Hands; (that is) put any Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
upon God; and therefore certainly now
we cannot. And partly too, not because whatever
we do, it will carry a Proportion with these
common Mercies. We are proud Creatures, and
think of a Condignity of Works, and to merit
from Heaven these Mercies: But alas! there's no
Comparison; and if God would deal with us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Merit, and strict Commutative Justice, we
cannot give him a valuable Compensation for
temporal Mercies. <hi>Gen. 32. 10. I am not worthy
of the least of all the Mercies which thou hast shewed
unto thy Servant.</hi> Though none of God's Mercies
can simply be said to be little; for whatsoever
comes from a great God should be great in our
Value and Esteem, as a small Remembrance from
a great Person is much prized; therefore no
Mercy is simply little, but comparatively; now
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:47528:167"/>
the least Mercies some have, and others the
greatest temporal Things: When we are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ballance, We, and all our Worth and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servings,
cannot counterpoize the least Mercy,
or merit the daily Bread we have from God. And
then the little Good we do, it is meerly by the
Grace that we have received. If one Man differs
from another, who made him differ? It is but a
new Gift, he is the more indebted to God.</p>
               <p>4. We deserve the <hi>contrary.</hi> We have forfeited
our Lives, and all our Comforts; we have put
our selves out of God's Protection by Sin. Death
way-laid us, when we were in our Mothers Womb;
and as soon as we were born, there was a Sentence
in force against us. <hi>Rom. 5. 12. Death came upon
all, for that all have sinned.</hi> And still we continue
the Forfeiture. We provoke God to cut us off.
It is a kind of pardoning Mercy, by which we
subsist every moment. This is sensible in case of
Sickness, when our Lives and Comforts slide from
us, when there is but a Step between us and
Death, when the Old Covenant comes to be put
in Suit, and God seems to be executing the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Law. And that is the Reason why
the temporal Deliverance of the Wicked and
Impenitent, is called a Remission; as, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 38.
<hi>But he being full of Compassion, forgave their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and destroyed them not.</hi> And, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 26, 27, 28.
<hi>Have Patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And
the Lord of that Servant was moved with Compassion,
and forgave him the Debt.</hi> Why is it call'd a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission?</hi>
Improperly, because it was a Reprieve
from the temporal Judgment for a time; it was,
not an executing the Sentence which was in force
against us: And it was not from any thing in the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:47528:167"/>
Sinner, but from God's pity over his Creatures.
And a godly Man, every time his Life and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
are in danger, hath a Pardon renewed at
that time. <hi>Isa. 38. 17. Thou hast in love to my
Soul delivered it from the Pit of Corruption; for
thou hast cast all my Sins behind thy Back.</hi> They
are loved out of Danger, and loved out of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
the pardoning Mercy of God is indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
to them.</p>

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For Information, in two Branches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First;</hi> That God will give his People temporal
Things: Not only Pardon, and Grace, and
Glory; but <hi>no good Thing will he with-hold.</hi> Psal.
81. 11. Many say, they can trust God for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life, but cannot trust him for daily Bread.
This is an utter Mistake. Certainly, it is far more
easy to trust God for daily Bread, than for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life; because there are more Difficulties, more
natural Prejudices against these greater Mercies of
Pardon, and Eternal Life, than there can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the daily Effects of God's Bounty. It is a
harder matter to work through our natural Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
which lie against Eternal Life; than to
work through that Distrust, which lies against
God's Care over us, and Provision for us: Why?
For God's common Bounty, it reacheth to all his
Creatures, even to the smallest Worm; his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is over all his Works: And surely it is more
easy to believe his common Bounty, than his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Love, which runs in a distinct Channel to
such a sort of Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:47528:168"/>
But because many have too weak a Faith about
temporal Things, let us consider how willing
God is to distribute and give out these Supplies.
Several Things I might mention.</p>
                  <p>1. God's Respect to the Bodies of his People, is
a mighty Ground and Encouragement. God is in
Covenant with the Body, as well as the Soul. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ proves the Resurrection from thence,
that God is the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and
<hi>Iacob, Mat.</hi> 22. 32. This Argument can never
be made good, but upon this Supposition, that
God is in Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Body, with
the whole Believer; and therefore the Mark of
Circumcision was in their Flesh, as the Water of
Baptism is sprinkled upon our Bodies. Well
then, if the Bodies of the Saints be in Covenant
with God, certainly some of the Promises of the
Covenant do concern the Body, and Sustentation
of the present Life. But that is not all, but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ hath purchased both Body and Soul
1 Cor. 6. 20. <hi>Ye are bought with a Price; therefore
glorify God in your Body, and in your Spirit, which
are God's.</hi> Not only the Soul is Christ's, but the
Body.</p>
                  <p>You will say, That is ground of Service; but
what! can it be inferr'd, that therefore God will
provide for us? It is not only a ground of our
Service, but of Christ's Care of us. If Christ
had only purchased our Service, yet it were a
ground of Hope: If you expect Work and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
from a Body, you will give maintenance to
that Body. But Christ's Purchase implieth his
Care over that he hath purchased; for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
God hath in us in Redemption, is a gracious
Interest. God had an Interest in us before we
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:47528:168"/>
were redeemed; we could not make void his
Right, by any Rebellion of ours: But then God
hath such an Interest in us, as engaged and solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
him to destroy us. Look as a Prince hath
an Interest in his Subjects; if they rebell, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
from their Obedience, they cannot disannul
his Right; but it is such a Right, as binds him to
pursue and chastise them, until they return to
their Duty: So God hath a Right to the fallen
Creature, but it was such a Right as sollicited
Vengeance. But the Right Christ purchased,
was a gracious Right, that God might protect and
preserve us. Well then, if Christ purchased Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Soul, he hath obtained, not only that
God should be gracious to our Souls, but gracious
to our Bodies; then the Argument runs clearly
for confirming the Faith of the Saints, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of temporal Benefits.</p>
                  <p>2. God hath given us greater things, therefore
he will not stand upon the less; when a Man hath
been at great Cost, he will not lose it. The Lord
hath given us his Christ; <hi>Rom. 8. 32. He that spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not his own his Son, but delivered him up for us all;
how shall he not with him also freely give us all
Things?</hi> Can any Man be so illogical, so ill-skilled
in Consequences, as not to conclude from
thence, if God give us Christ, with him he will
give us all things? So, <hi>Mat. 6. 33. Seek first the
Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness, and all
other Things shall be added to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. These things are dispensed to inferior, yea,
to the worst of his Creatures; <hi>Psal. 147. 9. He
giveth to the Beast his Food, and to the young Ravens
which cry.</hi> Will God maintain the Beasts of the
Field? and will he not maintain his Children?
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:47528:169"/>
It is monstrous and unnatural to think thus, that
God will not support you, and bear you out in
your Work. This is Christ's own Argument,
<hi>Mat. 6. 34. Take therefore no thought for the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
for the Morrow shall take thought for the Things
of it self: Sufficient unto the Day is the Evil
thereof.</hi> Daily Bread is in your Father's Power,
and he gives it graciously to all his Creatures,
and therefore certainly he will give it to you.
Thus you may see with what Confidence you may
expect daily Supplies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; It informs us, that we may ask tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Things, if we ask them lawfully. It is
true, Prayers to God for spiritual Things are
more acceptable. As your Child pleaseth you
better, when it comes to you to be taught its
Book, rather than when it comes for an Apple:
So it is more pleasing to God, when you come
for the Mediator's Blessing, and spiritual Things.
Acts 3. 26. <hi>God hath sent him to bless you, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away every one of you from his Iniquities.</hi> But
yet we may ask other Things; why? For they
are good and useful to us in the Course of our
Service, and without them we are exposed to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Temptations. And Prayer easeth you of a
deal of carking about them. <hi>Phil. 4. 6. Be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for nothing; but in every Thing, by Prayer and
Supplication, with Thanksgiving, let your Requests be
made known unto God.</hi> We may ask them, but it
must be lawfully; and that for Order, not in the
<hi>first place.</hi> That is howling, when we come to
God meerly for Corn, Wine and Oil; when we
prefer these Things before his Favour, and the
Graces of his Spirit. Then it must be lawful
too as to the Manner; a moderate Proportion,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:47528:169"/>
not to set God a Task to maintain you at such a
rate, but to ask a moderate Allowance. Christ
teacheth us here to pray for <hi>Bread,</hi> which is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Allowance. <hi>Prov. 30. 8. Feed me with Food
convenient for me.</hi> And, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 8. If we have
Food and Raiment, let us therewith be content.</hi> And
then ask them with Humility, and Submission to
the Will of God. We ought to say, as in <hi>Iam.
4. 15. If the Lord will, we will go to such a Place,
and get Gain.</hi> And then lawfully too, as to the
End; not for an unlawful End, for Ostentation
and Riot, that we may live at large, and at ease.
Jam. 4. 3. <hi>Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask
amiss, that ye may consume it upon your Lusts.</hi> But
we must ask it for a good End: <hi>Psal. 115. 1. Not
unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name
give Glory, for thy Mercy, and for thy Truths sake.</hi>
Lord, not for our Ease, or our Plenty, but that
thy Name may be glorified, that we may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in Service. And then again, lawfully as to
the Plea; We must not come and challenge it, as
if it were our Due; we must not use the Plea of
Merit, but of Mercy. Our Saviour doth not say,
Let this Bread come to us any how, as he saith,
<hi>Let thy Will be done;</hi> our Subjection to God is due;
but, <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread,</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord's Mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Let us not place our Confidence in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Causes, but in God, by whose Goodness
and Providence over us, all temporal Things do
come unto us; for without him, all our Carking
and Labour is nothing; and if we have our
Wishes without Labour, yet we shall not have
our Comfort and Blessing without God. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 27.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:47528:170"/>
                     <hi>Which of you by taking thought, can add one Cubit
unto his Stature?</hi> By <hi>taking thought,</hi> he meaneth
<hi>anxious Care about Success.</hi> We cannot change
the Colour of a Hair by all our anxious Thoughts.
We cannot make our selves stronger, or taller.
Many a Man is pierced through with worldly
Cares, and still the World frowns upon him, so
all his Care comes to nothing. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 4. it is
said, <hi>The Hand of the Diligent maketh rich;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it with <hi>vers.</hi> 22. and it is said, <hi>The Blessing
of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no Sorrow
with it.</hi> Most commonly they that are diligent,
they thrive with their Diligence; yea, but if that
be all, if they have not the Lord's Blessing, they
have not that Sweetness and Peace, when they
have gotten Abundance. O therefore let us place
our Confidence, not in second Causes, but in
God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Let us be thankful to God for these
vvorldly Things that vve enjoy. I urge this:</p>
                  <p>First; Because of the Danger of Ingratitude.
Usually we never forget God more, than when he
remembreth us most. When Men have what
they would have, then God is neglected; they
grow careless in Prayer, or flat and cold in the
performance of it. There is a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between Men poor and rich: When poor,
they will seem to put a natural Fervency into
their Prayers; but when rich, they grow cold
and careless. Mark what the Lord saith, <hi>Hosea
13. 6. They were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>illed, and their Heart was exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
therefore have they forgotten me.</hi> O how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
is this, that many having been kept under a
great Sense of God in a low Condition, but when
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:47528:170"/>
they have been well at ease, then they bear it up,
as if they could live without God. the Bucket
comes to the River with an empty Mouth, gaping
to receive its Fulness, as it were; but when it is
full, the Bottom is turned towards it: So it is
very usual with Men, to turn their Backs upon
the Mercy-Seat; and when the Lord hath given
them great Increase in worldly Things, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
out a great Estate to them, he hath very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Rent from them. Now because this is usual,
therefore those whom God hath blessed with the
Supplies of the present Life, how should they
study Thankfulness!</p>
                  <p>Secondly; Because of the <hi>Equity</hi> of it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what an Equity there is, that we should be
thankful for outward Blessings.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. They are good in themselves.</item>
                     <item>2. They come from God.</item>
                     <item>3. They come from the Lord's Grace and
Mercy.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. They are good in themselves. Food and
Raiment is good, and <hi>every Creature of God is
good.</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 4. They are good things, tho
not the best things. They are good for our selves,
that we may serve God more chearfully. The
Lord would have the <hi>Levites and Priests have their
Portion, that they might be encouraged in the Law of
the Lord.</hi> 2 Chron. 31. 4. Now these things are
good to encourage us, and support us in our
Work. Man consists of two parts, of a Body,
and of a Soul. Now whether we look to the one,
or the other, you will have many Arguments to
love and praise God, not only for what he hath
done for our Souls, but likewise for our Bodies.
And they are good, because they prevent many
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:47528:171"/>
Snares and Temptations. <hi>Prov. 30. 9. Lest I be
poor, and steal, and take the Name of my God in vain.</hi>
Diseases which arise from Fulness, are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
but Diseases which arise from Indigence
and Emptiness, they are more dangerous: So
Diseases of Prosperity, they are more common;
it is a rank Soil, and yields more Weeds: but
Diseases which arise from Poverty, breed Atheism,
Irreligion, and Rebellion against God. They
are good, as they make us more useful for God
and Man. For God, as having more Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for the honouring of God: <hi>Prov. 3. 9. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Lord with thy Substance, and with the First-Fruits
of all thine Increase.</hi> And of doing good
to others: <hi>That we may have to distribute to them
that need.</hi> Eph. 4. 28. O we should all covet and
affect mightily, to have wherewith to relieve
the Necessities of others.</p>
                  <p>2. As they are Blessings, so they are Blessings
which do not come by Chance, or by Man's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
1 <hi>Tim. 6. 17. The living God, who giveth
us richly all Things to enjoy.</hi> The People of God
are plentifully provided for. Your Tables are
well furnished, Backs well cloathed, it is God
which gives you richly to enjoy them, and he
must be acknowledged; as <hi>David</hi> doth, 1 <hi>Chron.
29. 14. For all Things come of thee, and of thine
own have we given thee.</hi> Then, ver. 16. <hi>O Lord,
our God, all this Store that we have prepared, to build
thee an House for thine holy Name, cometh of thine
hand, and is all thine own.</hi> Tho you your selves
have been Purchasers of your own Estate, and
Carvers of your own Fortune, (as Man is most
apt to forget God there) yea, but tho you have
prepared and brought together a great deal of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:47528:171"/>
Store, yet, <hi>Lord, all comes from thee.</hi> It sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the Mercy. When you are at the Table, to
be carved to by a great Person, their Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
is counted a greater Favour than the Meal
it self: So it is not barely the Comfort we have
by the Creature, which sweetneth it; but when
we think of the Donor, that the great God should
think of us, that it is God which spreads our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for us, that doth put this Meat and Drink be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us. <hi>It was he that gave Seed to the Sower, and
Bread for Food.</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 10. When we take it
immediately out of God's Hands, it is much
sweeter. And not only so, but also it is the more
sanctified. When we look to second Causes, we
shall surely abuse the Mercy: <hi>Hos. 2. 8. For she
did not know that I gave her Corn, and Wine, and
Oil, and multiplied her Silver and Gold;</hi> what then?
<hi>Therefore she prepared it for</hi> Baal. When God's
Kindness is not taken notice of, when we do not
see God in our Mercies, we shall not use them for
God. That Man will surely improve his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
ill, that doth not see God in them. Now
that which comes from God, leads the Heart to
God again; then the Creature is sanctified.
Therefore acknowledg God in these outward
Things. We should say of every Morsel of
Bread, this is God's Gift to me; of every Nights
Sleep, this is the Lord's Goodness. When God
is acknowledged in these outward Things, he
takes it the more kindly, and we are the better
for it; the Mercy is the sweeter, and the more
sanctified.</p>
                  <p>3. They not only come from God, but from
the Lord's <hi>free Grace and Mercy.</hi> These are two
distinct Notions, by which God's Goodness is set
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:47528:172"/>
out, and they are both significant and expressive
in the present Case: Grace, that doth all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
Mercy, that pitieth the Miserable.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Then we have them from Grace; Grace
is at liberty to give them to whom it will. Well,
there is Grace in these outward Things; for God
gives them to whom he will, to some, not to
others. O when we consider the Distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and others, every one hath not such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
Supplies, nay, many of those of whom the
World is not worthy; surely this is meerly the
Lord's Goodness. <hi>Prov. 22. 2. The Rich and the
Poor meet together, the Lord is the Maker of them
all.</hi> They had the same Maker that you had,
(others which are destitute) therefore why is it
you have more than they? It is meerly from
Grace. Why is one Vessel framed for an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Use, and another for a baser Use? So it
pleased the Potter. God, as the great Master of
the Scenes, appointeth to every Man what part
he shall act, meerly out of his own Grace, he is
bound to none. It was a good Speech of <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,</hi>
the great Conqueror of the East, to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>azet;
What did God see in thee, that art blind in
one Eye, and me, that am lame of one Leg, that he
should make us, passing by many others, the Lords of
so many opulent and mighty Kingdoms?</hi> A savoury
Speech from an Infidel! What did God see in
any of us, to exalt, cherish, and supply us, and
let pass many others, who for moral Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and vertuous Endowments, do far exceed
us? When we consider this Distinction, then,
<hi>Even so, Father, because it pleased thee.</hi> There
is a kind of Election and Reprobation in these
common Mercies, (that is) God will dispense
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:47528:172"/>
them to one, and not to another; he will be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in their <hi>Poverty,</hi> and glorified in thy <hi>Wealth,</hi>
and therefore there's Grace in it.</p>
                  <p>(2.) There is <hi>Mercy</hi> in it that pitieth the
miserable. How doth it appear these good things
come from Mercy? because of our Want, and
because of our Forfeiture.</p>
                  <p>1. Our <hi>Want,</hi> and our Indigence. O when we
think what shiftless creatures we should have been,
if he had not provided for us: <hi>Psal. 40. 17. I am
poor and needy, yet the Lord thinketh upon me.</hi> If
we were but sensible of our own Weakness and
Emptiness, and manifold Necessities, we would
admire that God should think of us, such forlorn
and wretched Creatures; or that our Baseness
and Poverty doth not make us contemptible to
God. <hi>Psal. 34. 6. This poor Man cried, and the
Lord heard him; and saved him out of all his Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi>
He doth not say, this <hi>wise</hi> Man, this <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>
Saint, but this <hi>poor</hi> Man. This was the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gentiles, That the Divine Powers
did only care for the great and weighty Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the World, but other things he left to
their own Event, and their own Chance; as if
God in the great throng of Business were not at
leisure to attend every private Man's Request.
These were the fond Surmises the Gentiles had of
God: But we are taught better. <hi>This poor Man
cried unto the Lord, and be heard him.</hi> Poor Men in
the World, when they have any thing to do with
great Persons, they must look long, wait, pray,
and pay, to seek their Face and Favour, &amp; at length
meet with a rough Answer, and sour Look. But
God will not shut the Door, the Throne of Grace
lies open for every Comer. You will say, this
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:47528:173"/>
would sweeten Mercies to the <hi>Poor:</hi> Nay, it
concerns not only those that are actually poor,
but the <hi>great</hi> ones of the World; (for they are
poor and shiftless in themselves, if God did not
provide for them) others are but Glasses where
they might see their own Misery. If they did
well weigh the Wants and Necessities of others,
they might see what would have been their
own Case, if the Lord had not been merciful to
them. As <hi>Austin,</hi> when he saw a Beggar frisking
and leaping after his Belly was fill'd, the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
wrought much upon him, that he had not such
rejoycing in God, who tasted so much of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.
Saith <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> If you are not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for Health, go to the Spittles and Lazar-houses,
and see what might have been your own Case.
Thus if you are not thankful for abundance, go
to the Families where there are Children that
want Bread. It is the Lord's Mercy to the richest,
for they were miserable and indigent. It is a
great Mercy to relieve those from Hand to
Mouth: But you that have abundance, it is a
double Mercy to you, for he prevents the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
before it was felt; as <hi>Psal. 21. 3. Thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventest
him with the Blessings of Goodness:</hi> David
takes notice of the Goodness of God to him.
Before the need is felt and observed, you are sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and this should be a great Indearment of
the Lord's Mercy to you.</p>
                  <p>2. It is Mercy if we consider not only our
<hi>Want,</hi> but our <hi>Forfeiture.</hi> It is not only Mercy,
but pardoning Mercy, at least a reprieving from
Trouble, for we deserved the contrary. There
is a kind of Temporary-Pardon, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all these Blessings. It is as great a Curse as
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:47528:173"/>
possibly <hi>David</hi> could thunder out against obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Sinners, and God's implacable Enemies:
<hi>Psal. 28. 4. Give them according to their Deeds, and
according to the wickedness of their Endeavours.</hi>
Do we think this would be matter of Mischief
only to <hi>David</hi>'s Enemies? No, every one of us, if
we had our Deserts, we should soon be shiftless,
harbourless, begging from Door to Door, yea
howling for one drop of Mercy to cool our
Tongues. O then surely the Lord is to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and acknowledged in bestowing the good
things of this present Life. Well then,</p>
                  <p>As these Blessings come from God, let them
carry up your Heart to God again. As all Rivers
they run from the Sea, and they discharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the Sea again; so let all be returned
to God with Thankfulness, with acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that you have received them from God.
I shall urge it with one Example; Jesus Christ,
though he were Heir, Lord of all things, <hi>Who
thought it no Robbery to be equal with God;</hi> yet you
find him ever giving Thanks when he used the
Creatures; <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 36. And it is the main
thing <hi>Iohn</hi> taketh notice of, and passeth by the
Miracle, <hi>Iohn 6. 23. Where they did eat Bread,
after that the Lord had given Thanks.</hi> Nigh to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias</hi>
there was the place where our Lord fed
many with five Loaves and two Fishes; but he
only saith this, where they did eat Bread, <hi>after
that the Lord had given Thanks:</hi> he saw this was
a notable Circumstance, so he doth but cursorily
mention the Miracle, only calls it <hi>eating Bread,</hi>
but expresly mentioneth Christ's blessing the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
He would teach us, that the blessing of all
Injoyments is in God's Hand.</p>

                     <hi>VSE</hi> 4. If the Lord be the Donor, and Giver
of all these outward things, let us beware we do
not abuse these Gifts of God, as Occasions of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
against the Giver, that we fight not against
him with his own Weapons. Jesus Christ speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own Disciples, though they were train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up with him, a Company chosen out, and
select Family, who were to be his Heraulds and
Ambassadors to the World, yet he gives them
this Caution; <hi>Luke 21. 34. Take heed to your
selves, lest at any time your Hearts be over-charged
with Surfeiting and Drunkenness, and Cares of this
Life, and so that day come upon you unawares.</hi> He
saw it needful to warn his own Disciples. We
had two common Parents, <hi>Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and
one miscarried by <hi>eating,</hi> and the other by <hi>drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
these Sins are natural to us. The Throat
is a slippery place, and had need well be looked
unto. Mark, Christ there doth not mean Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
and Drunkenness meerly in a gross Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
When we hear of Surfeiting and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
we think of spuing, staggering, reeling, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting,
and the like; but we are to consider it in
a stricter Notion; <hi>Take heed lest the Heart be
over-charged.</hi> The Heart may be over-charged,
when the Stomach is not; (that is) when we
are less apt to <hi>praise</hi> God, grow more <hi>lumpish</hi> and
heavy; or rather when we settle into a <hi>sensual</hi>
frame of Spirit, and by an inordinate delight in
our present Portion, are taken off from minding
better things. Look as the Heart is over-charged
with the Cares of the World; so likewise with
Creature-Delights, and Comforts of this World,
when it is set for Ease and Vanity. Many that
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:47528:174"/>
would be loathers of the other Drunkenness, yet
are guilty of this kind of Surfeiting and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
the Heart is over-charged with an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Affection to present things. There cannot
be a more heavy Judgment, than when our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is made our Snare: <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 22. A Snare, it
is God's spiritual Judgment; when the Comforts
of this Life serve not so much to lengthen and
strengthen Life; but when their Hearts are
hardned in Sin, and they grow neglectful of
God, and heavenly things. <hi>Raining Snares</hi> is an
Argument of God's Hatred. First, <hi>The Lord
shall rain Snares; and then, Brimstone and an horrible
Tempest shall be their Portion:</hi> Psal. 11. 6. So it
makes way for his eternal Anger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>VSE</hi> 5. Let us be contented with that Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which God hath given us of worldly things, if
the Lord be the Donor. Why?</p>
                  <p>1. Because God stands upon his Sovereignty;
you must stand to God's Allowance, though he
gives to others more, and to you less; for God is
supream, and will not be controll'd in the disposal
of what is his own. The good Man of the House
pleaded, <hi>Mat. 20. 13, 14, 15. Friend, I do thee
no wrong; is it not lawful for me to do what I will with
mine own?</hi> The fulness of the Earth, and all, is his:
and therefore though others have better trading,
and finer Apparel, and be more amply provided
for than we are, God is Soveraign, and will give
according to his Pleasure, and you must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
                  <p>2. Nothing is deserved, and therefore certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
every thing should be kindly taken. If a Man
be kept at free-cost, and maintain'd at your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:47528:175"/>
you take it very ill, if he murmur and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
his Diet. Certainly we are all maintain'd at
free-cost, and therefore we should with all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Contentation receive what ever God will put
into our Hands.</p>
                  <p>3. God knows what Proportion is best for us,
he is a God of <hi>Iudgment,</hi> and knows what is most
convenient for us, for he is a wise God. It is
the Shepherd must chuse the Pasture, not the
Sheep. Leave it to God to give you that which
is convenient, and suitable to your Condition of
Life. A Shoe may be too big for the Foot, and
a Garment too great for the Body, as <hi>Saul</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
was too large for little <hi>David; 1 Sam.</hi> 17.
God will give you that which is convenient, that
which is agreeable to you. A Garment, when
too long, proves a dirty Rag; we may have too
much, and therefore God he carves out our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
with a wise Hand.</p>
                  <p>4. God doth not only give suitable to your
Condition, but suitable to your <hi>Strength,</hi> such a
Portion as you are able to bear. God layeth
<hi>Affliction</hi> upon his People, and he gives them
Mercies as they are able to <hi>bear;</hi> if they had more,
they would have more Snares, more Temptations.
You find it hard for a rich Man to enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven; <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 24. A Man may
take a larger Draught than he is able to bear:
so God proportioneth every Man's Condition ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rding
to his spiritual Strength; every Man is
not able to bear a very high prosperous Estate:
<hi>Heb. 13. 5. Let your Conversation be without Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness;
and be content with such things as ye have:
for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor for sake
thee:</hi> then you will live upon the Promise. But
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:47528:175"/>
when Men set God a Task, and he must main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them at such a rate; that ends in Mischief and
Distrust. <hi>Psal. 78. 19. Can God furnish a Table
in the Wilderness?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>5. Contentation is one of God's Gifts that we
ask in this Prayer, [<hi>Give us this day our daily
Bread.</hi>] that is, we ask to be contented with
our Portion. Contentment and quietness of
Mind with what we do injoy, it's a great Blessing:
<hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 19. See what the Lord saith there by his
Prophet: <hi>I will send you Corn, and Wine, and Oil,
and ye shall be satisfied therewith.</hi> The bare and
simple Blessing doth not speak so much of God's
Love, as when we are satisfied, when we have
Contentment in it; that's the greater Blessing.
When our Minds are suited to our Condition,
then the Creature is more sweet, more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
Your Happiness lies not in <hi>Abundance,</hi>
but in <hi>Contentment; Luke</hi> 12. 15. This doth not
make a Man happy, that he hath <hi>much;</hi> but this,
that he is <hi>contented;</hi> he hath what God will give
him. All spiritual Miseries may be referred to
these two things; a War between a Man and his
Conscience, and a War between his Affections
and his Condition.</p>
                  <p>6. There may be as much <hi>Love</hi> in a <hi>lesser</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as in a <hi>greater.</hi> There's the same Affection
to a small younger Child, though he hath not so
large an Allowance, as the elder Brother; yet
saith he, my Father loves me as well as him;
not that I have a double Portion, but I have as
much of my Father's Love: So a Child of God
may say, God loves me though he hath given
another more, and me less. Be content with
what falls to your share, and with your Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:47528:176"/>
by the wise Designation and Allotment
of God's Providence. Thus much for the first
Point.</p>
                  <p>A Word of a second, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doct. 2. <hi>In asking temporal things, Christ hath
stinted us to a day, [Give us,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, this
day <hi>our daily Bread.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>God in an extraordinary manner fed his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the Wilderness; the <hi>Mannah</hi> stank if they
had kept it another day; they had it from day
to day. What's the Reason Christ saith, <hi>Give us
this day?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That every day we may pray to God:
Therefore it is not, give us this <hi>Month,</hi> or <hi>Year,</hi>
but <hi>Day;</hi> because every day God will hear from
us: 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 17. Pray without ceasing:</hi> God would
not have us too long out of his Company, but
by a frequent Commerce he would have us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
and familiar with him. This is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that you should not let a day pass over your
Head, but God must hear from you, for your
Patent lasts but for a day; you have a Lease from
God of your Comforts and Mercies, but it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired
unless you renew it again by Prayer. How
much do they differ from the Heart of God's
Children, that could be contented (like the
High-Priest of old) to come to the Mercy-seat
but once a Year? now the Lord would have us
come every day to the Throne of Grace.</p>
                  <p>2. Every day, because there should be <hi>Family</hi>-Prayer;
for all that taketheir Meat together, are
to come, and say to God; <hi>Give us this day our daily
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:47528:176"/>
Bread.</hi> It is not said, <hi>Give me,</hi> but <hi>Give us:</hi>
Therefore you see how little of Love and Fear
of God is there, where Week after Week they
call not upon God's Name.</p>
                  <p>3. To make way for our <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</hi>
Our Mercies they flow not from God all
at once, but some to day, and some to morrow,
for we take them day by day; alltogether, they
are too heavy for us to weild and manage: <hi>Psal.
68. 19. Who daily loadeth us with Benefits.</hi> Our
Mercies they come in greater <hi>Number,</hi> and a
greater <hi>Measure,</hi> then we are able to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
make use of, or be thankful for. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this is the burden of gracious Hearts, that
Mercies come so thick and fast, they cannot be
thankful enough for them: but to help us, God
distributes them by Parcels; who loadeth us <hi>daily,</hi>
some to <hi>day,</hi> some to <hi>morrow,</hi> and every day, that
we may not forget God, but may have a new
Argument to praise him.</p>
                  <p>4. To shew us every day we should renew our
Dependance upon God for temporal things.
There is no day but we stand in need of the
Lord's Blessing, of Sanctification, of Comfort,
that they may not be a Snare, that there is still
need of new Strength; new Grace, and new
Supplies.</p>
                  <p>5. Again, <hi>Give us this day,</hi> that we may not
burden our selves with over-much Thoughtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that we might not solicitously cark for to
morrow: <hi>Mat. 6. 34. Sufficient unto the day is the
evil thereof.</hi> Every day affords Business, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Care, and Burden enough; we need not
anticipate and pre-occupy the Cares of the next
day; God would not have us over-born with
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:47528:177"/>
Sollicitude, but look no further than this day</p>
                  <p>6. Christ would teach us, that worldly things
should be sought in a <hi>moderate</hi> Proportion; if we
have sufficient for a day, for the present Want,
we should not grasp at too much. Ships lightly
loaden will pass through the Sea; but when we
take too great a burden, the Ship will easily sink
with every Storm. We have sore Troubles to
pass through in the World; now when we are
over-burdened with present things, we have
more Snares and Temptations.</p>
                  <p>7. Christ would train us up with thoughts of
our Lives <hi>Vncertainty; Iames</hi> 4. 13. say not, This
and this I will <hi>do, to day or to morrow: What is your
Life? it is but a Vapor.</hi> One being invited to
Dinner the next day, said, for these many Years
I have not had a to-morrow; meaning he was
providing every day for his last day. We do
not know whether we have another day, but
are apt to sing Lullabies to our Souls, and say,
<hi>Soul, take thine Ease, thou hast Goods laid up for
many Years:</hi> Luke 12. 19. We are sottishly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
and dream of <hi>many Years,</hi> whereas God tells
us only of <hi>to day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. To awaken us after <hi>heavenly</hi> things. When
we seek Bread for the present Life, then give us
<hi>this day:</hi> but now come to me, saith Christ, and
I will give you <hi>Bread</hi> that shall nourish you to
<hi>eternal Life,</hi> Bread that endureth for ever: <hi>Iohn
6. 27. Labour not for the Meat which perisheth, but
for that Meat which endureth unto everlasting Life.</hi>
There is Meat that will endure for ever, but for
the present, we beg only for this day. 1 <hi>Pet.
1. 4. To an Inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled,
and that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:47528:177"/>
you.</hi> That's an eternal State, this is but of a
short, and of a small continuance: You see what
need you have to go to God, that he will most
plentifully provide for you.</p>

               <p>WE have now done with the <hi>Supplication</hi> of
this Prayer, and are come to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations.</hi>
The <hi>Supplications,</hi> are those Petitions
which we make to God for obtaining of that
which is <hi>good.</hi> The <hi>Deprecations,</hi> are those Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
we make to God for removing of that

two: 1. We pray for the Remission of Evil
that is already <hi>committed.</hi> 2. We pray for the
prevention of the Evil which may be <hi>inflicted.</hi>
The first of these is the Petition we have now in
hand. Here,
<list>
                     <item>1. The Petition is proposed: <hi>Forgive us our
Debts.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. 'Tis confirmed by an Argument; <hi>As we
forgive our Debtors.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In the first take notice,
<list>
                     <item>1. Of the <hi>Object,</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> of this Petition,
and that is, <hi>Debts.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The <hi>Subject,</hi> or <hi>Persons</hi> praying, <hi>Vs.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="340" facs="tcp:47528:178"/>
3. The Person to whom we pray, <hi>our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father,</hi> who alone can forgive our Sins.</item>
                     <item>4. The <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>God</hi> about this Object, <hi>Forgive.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Petition is <hi>confirmed</hi> by an Argument,
which is taken from <hi>our forgiving of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which there's an Argument.</p>
               <p>1. A <hi>Simili,</hi> from a like Disposition in us.
Thus, what is good in us, was first in God; for
he is the Patern of all Perfection. If we have
such a Disposition planted in our Hearts; and
if it be a Vertue in us, surely the same Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is in God; for the first being wanteth no
Perfection.</p>
               <p>2. The Argument may be taken <hi>à dispari,</hi> or
<hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> from the less to the greater.
If we that have but a drop of Mercy, can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
the Offences done to us; surely the infinite
God, that is Mercy it self, he hath more Bowels,
and more Pity; <hi>For his ways are above our ways,
as high as the Heaven is above the Earth:</hi> Isa. 55. 9.
So it seems the Argument is propounded; <hi>Luke
11. 4. Forgive us our Sins; for we also forgive eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that is indebted to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Argument may be taken from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
or the Qualification of those that are to
expect Pardon. They are such that out of a
sense of God's Mercy to them, and the Love of
God shed abroad in their Hearts, are inclined
and disposed to shew Mercy to others. So Christ
explains it, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. making it a Condition or
Qualification on our part: <hi>If ye forgive Men
their Trespasses, your heavenly Father will also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
you.</hi> But this will be more abundantly clear
when I come to examine that Clause.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:47528:178"/>
Before we come to the Petition it self, the
Connection is to be considered; for the Particle
[<hi>And</hi>] links it to the former Petition. After
<hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> he doth not say, <hi>And thy
Kingdom come;</hi> they are propounded as distinct
Sentences: but <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread,
And forgive us our Debts;</hi> for three Reasons.</p>
               <p>1. Without Pardon, all the good Things of
this Life will do us no good: They are but as a
full Diet, or as a rich Suit to a condemned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
they will not comfort him, and allay his
present Fears. Until we are pardoned, we are
under a Sentence, ready for Execution, and
therefore we cannot have that Comfort in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Things, until we have some Interest in
God's fatherly Mercy. A Man that is condemned,
hath the King's Allowance until Execution: So
it is the Indulgence of God to a wicked Man, to
give him many outward Things, tho he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
already. We should not satisfy our
selves with daily Bread, without a sense of some
Interest in pardoning Mercy.</p>
               <p>2. To shew us our Unworthiness. Our Sins
are so many and grievous, that we are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of one Morsel of Bread to put in our Mouths.
When we say, <hi>Give us this day,</hi> &amp;c. we need
presently to say, <hi>Forgive us our Sins.</hi> There is a
Forfeiture even of these common Blessings. <hi>Gen.
32. 10. I am not worthy of the least of all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and of all the Truth, which thou hast shewed
unto thy Servant.</hi> All that we have, we have
from Mercy, and it is Mercy undeserved. As we
are Creatures, there can be no common Right
between God and us, to engage him to give tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Blessings; for we owe our selves wholly to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:47528:179"/>
him, as being created out of nothing; Children
cannot oblige their Parents. But much more as
we are guilty Creatures, it is meerly of the Mercy
of the Lord.</p>
               <p>3. These are join'd together, because Sin is the
great Obstacle and Hindrance of all the Blessings
which we expect from God. <hi>Ier. 5. 25. Your
Sins have with-held good Things from you.</hi> When
Mercy comes to us, Sin stands in the way, and
turns it back again, so that it cannot have so
clear a Passage to us. Therefore God must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,
before he can <hi>give,</hi> (that is) bestow these
outward Things as a Blessing on us.</p>
               <p>Having spoken of this Connexion, let me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
something from the Petition it self.</p>
               <p>The first Thing I shall observe is, the Notion
by which Sin is set out, <hi>Forgive us our Debts.</hi>
The Point is:</p>
               <p>Doct. I. <hi>That Sins come under the Notion of
Debts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 4. it is, <hi>Forgive us our Sins.</hi> There
is a twofold Debt which Man oweth to God.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A Debt of Duty.</item>
                  <item>2. A Debt of Punishment.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. A Debt of Duty, Worship, and Obedience;
this is a Debt we owe to God. In this sence it
is said, <hi>Rom. 8. 12. We are Debtors, not to; the
Flesh, to live after the Flesh:</hi> In which Negative,
the Affirmative is clearly implied, that we are
Debtors to God, to live to God; Debtors to the
Spirit, to live after the Spirit. By the Law of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:47528:179"/>
Creation, we were not appointed to serve and
please the Flesh, but to serve God. <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10.
<hi>When you have done all those things which are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you, say, We are unprofitable Servants, we have
done that which was our Debt or Duty to do.</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Worship, and Service is a Debt we owe
to God, by virtue of that Interest which he hath
in us, and Command he hath over us. And
so you have that Speech, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. that we are
<hi>Debtors to the whole Law,</hi> as we come under the
Obedience of it.</p>
               <p>2. A Debt of Punishment, which we are fallen
into through the neglect of our Duty. Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is due to us as Wages: <hi>Rom. 6. 23. The
Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> God hath as it were
made a Contract with us, that if we will sin, we
must take our Wages; we must take what it
comes to.</p>
               <p>Now in this Petition, when we say, <hi>Forgive
us our Debts,</hi> we do not desire to be discharged
of the Duty we owe to God, but to be acquitted
of the Guilt and Punishment. The Faults or Sins
that we are guilty of, oblige us, and bind us to
the Punishment; and therefore Sins are called
Debts. The original Debt we owe, is Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and in case of Default, the next Debt we
owe is Punishment. Look as in a Contract and
Bond, if the Party observe not the Condition,
then he is liable to the Forfeiture: So God dealt
with Man by way of Covenant, and the Tenor
of it was exact Obedience; and this Covenant
had a Sanction or an Obligation annexed, in case
Obedience was not exactly performed, we should
be accursed, and suffer all manner of Misery in
this Life, and the next. Now by the Fall we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:47528:180"/>
this Penalty, and therefore as lost and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
Creatures, we run to God's Mercy, and beg
him to forgive the Debt, or the Forfeiture of
that Bond of Obedience, wherein Man standeth
bound to God by the Law.</p>
               <p>A little to make it good, (before I come to
the Body of the Petition) let me shew how Sin
is a Debt, wherein it agrees. That will appear,
if you can consider,
<list>
                     <item>1. Our Danger by Sin.</item>
                     <item>2. Our Remedy from Sin.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In both the Parts you will find Sin is considered
as a Debt.</p>
               <p>First; If you consider our Danger by Sin.</p>
               <p>1. There is a Creditor to whom the Debt is
due, and that is God. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 41. when he
would set out God's Mercy, he saith, <hi>There was
a certain Creditor, which had two Debtors,</hi> &amp;c. God
is there set forth under the Notion and Similitude
of a Creditor. God is a Creditor, partly as our
Creator, and partly as a Lawgiver, and partly as
a Judg. As our Creator and Benefactor, from
whom we have received all that we have. It was
the Lord that gave to every Man his Talents to
trade withal, to some more, to some less, <hi>Mat.</hi>
25. Thus God hath trusted us with Life, and all
other Blessings. But then as a <hi>Law-giver:</hi> If God
had given us Life, Strength, Parts, Wealth, that
we should do with them what we would; tho the
Gift would oblige us, in point of Gratitude, to
serve our Benefactor, yet we had not been so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsible
for our Defaults: But we are under a
Law to serve him, and honour him that made us,
and gave us what we have. God did not dispossess
himself of an Interest in them: He did not give
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:47528:180"/>
them to us as Owners and Proprietors, to do
with them what we would; but he gave them to
us as Stewards; our Life and Employment here
is a Stewardship. Nay, God is not only a
Law-giver, but also a Judg; he will call us to an
Account. He doth oblige us, as a Creator; but
imposeth a Necessity upon us of obeying and
serving him, as a Law-giver; and not only
makes a Law, but will take an Account of Men,
how they observe the Law of their Creation.
There will a Time come, when the Lord of those
Servants will come and reckon with them, and
require his own with Usury. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 23. He will
require this Debt and Service at our Hands, else
we must endure the Penalty. Well, this is the
Connection: He that abuseth God's Mercy, as
a Creator, offends him, as as Law-giver; and is
justly punished by him, as a Judg. There are
many never think of this, therefore are not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of these great Relations, nor that they shall
answer for all their Talents, Strength, and Time,
and Advantages they have in the World. Thus
there's a Creditor.</p>
               <p>2. As a Debtor is bound to make Satisfaction
to the Creditor, or else is liable to the Process of
the Law, which may be commenced against him:
So are we all to God, Bodies and Souls, we are
become <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>guilty before the Lord,
Rom.</hi> 3. 19. So we translate it. We are under
the Sentence of the Law, liable to the Process of
his revenging Justice, and one day God will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
his righteous Law against us. All the fallen
Creatures are quite become Bankrupt; we can
never pay the original Debt of Obedience, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be left to lie under the Debt of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:47528:181"/>
3. Look as Debts stand upon <hi>Record,</hi> and are
charged upon some Book of Account, that they
may not be forgot: So God hath his Book of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
a Book of Remembrance, as it is called,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. All our Words, Speeches, Actions,
they are all upon Record; what Means we have
enjoyed, what Mercies, what Opportunities,
what Calls, and what Messages of his Love and
Grace. <hi>Iob 14. 17. My Iniquity is sealed up in a
Bag.</hi> As Mens Writings or Bonds, which they
have to shew for their Debts owing to them, are
sealed up in a Bag; so <hi>Iob</hi> useth that Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
Thus is Sin represented as a Thing that
is upon Record, and cannot be forgotten. Many
times we lose the Memory of what we have done
in Childhood and Infancy; but all is upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and your Iniquities vvill one day find you
out, tho you have forgotten, and think never to
hear of them more.</p>
               <p>4. A Day of Reckoning will come, when God
will put the Bond in Suit, and all shall be called
to an Account. Sometimes God reckoneth with
Sinners (in part) in this World, but surely in
the next. Death is but the Summons to come to
an Account with God: <hi>Luke 16. 2. Give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of thy Stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer
Steward.</hi> That Passage of the Parable is applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Death;—<hi>That when ye fail, they may receive
you into everlasting Habitations,</hi> ver. 9. When the
Soul is turned out of Doors, when it is cited to
appear before the Tribunal of God, then vve
give up our Account. But especially at the great
Day: <hi>Rev. 20. 12. And I saw the Dead, small
and great, stand before God; and the Books were
opened;</hi> that is, the Book of Conscience, and the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:47528:181"/>
Book of God's Remembrance. There are two
Books that are written within and without, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which all our Actions are stamped; they are
now closed, in a great measure we know not
what is in these great Books. One of the Books,
that of Conscience, is in our own keeping, yet
we cannot deface and blot it out. These Books
at that Day will be opened; Conscience, by the
Power of God, shall be extended to the Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of all our Ways. Conscience writes,
when it speaks not: Many times it doth not
smite for Sins we are guilty of; but there stands
the Debt charged, upon which we shall be respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p>5. After this Reckoning there is <hi>Execution.</hi> A
Bankrupt, that cannot satisfy his Creditor, is
cast into Prison: So God hath his Prison for
impenitent, disobedient, and obstinate Sinners:
1 Pet. 3. 19. <hi>He went and preached unto the Spirits
in Prison.</hi> It is a dismal Prison, where poor
captive Prisoners are held in Chains of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that is, under the Horrors of their own
despairing Fears, looking for the Judgment of
the Lord, when they shall be cast into this Prison,
and no getting out again, until they have paid
the utmost Farthing, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 50. And that will
never be, as to the Sinner; He is (as it
were) always satisfying, and can never be said
to have satisfied the Justice of God.</p>
               <p>Thus you see how Sin is a Debt, and what
correspondence there is between them; the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of Punishment that ariseth from Sin.
But now it differeth from all other Debts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:47528:182"/>
1. No Debt to <hi>Man</hi> can be so great as our
Debt to <hi>God,</hi> both for number and weight.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 24. compar'd with <hi>Vers.</hi> 28. You shall
see there the Parable of the Lord, forgiving
<hi>ten thousand Talents;</hi> and the Servant goes and
takes his Brother by the Throat, and requireth
from him a Debt of <hi>an hundred Pence.</hi> Mark,
Offences done to God are greater than Offences
done to us; for there's as much Difference and
Disproportion, as between an hundred and ten
thousand. And then the Debt of the Fellow-Servant
was but <hi>Pence,</hi> an hundred Pence; but
the Debt due to the Lord, that was <hi>Talents;</hi> and
a Talent is reckoned to be one hundred eighty
seven Pounds, ten Shillings. Our Sins against
God are more and more heavy, than any which
our Brethren can commit against us. <hi>Pence, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents;
one hundred,</hi> and <hi>ten thousand:</hi> there's the
Difference and Disproportion. O that we had
a due sense of what it is to sin against God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
an Infinite Majesty! To strike a private
Person, is not so much as to strike an Officer of
Justice; and that's not so much as to strike the
supream Magistrate. What is it to sin against
God? and how often do we? All our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are only evil, and that continually; and
therefore all our Sins against God, will arise to a
vast and heavy Debt, because of the Infiniteness
of the Object against whom Sin is committed.</p>
               <p>2. In other Debts there's a <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Payment</hi> set
them; in this Debt there's <hi>none:</hi> God doth not
tell us when he will put the Bond in suit against
us; he may surprize us ere we are aware. <hi>Luke</hi>
12. 20. when he dream'd of <hi>many Years; Thou
Fool, this Night.</hi> The Spirits now in Prison, did
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:47528:182"/>
as little think of that doleful place, as those Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
which are alive. It may be to day, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
the next hour; <hi>Gen. 4. 7. Sin lyeth at the
Door:</hi> There's a Sentence, and Curse that way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
him: Sin, for the <hi>Punishment</hi> of Sin, it's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to seize upon him, and pluck him by the
Throat, and bring him into God's Presence. Still
the Curse hovers over the Head of obstinate and
impenitent Sinners.</p>
               <p>3. In other Debts, if the <hi>Goods</hi> are taken by
way of Execution, and suffice, the Person is
free: But here God aims at the Person, and the
whole Person. <hi>Body and Soul are cast into Hell Fire:</hi>
Mat. 10. 28.</p>
               <p>4. Here there can be no shifting, no avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Danger. If you fly from God, you do
but fly to God; from God, as willing to be a
Friend; to God, who is sure to be revenged.
<hi>Whither shall I fly from thy Spirit? If I go into the
Depths, thou art there:</hi> Psal. 139. God is here,
there, and every where.</p>
               <p>5. All other Debts cease at <hi>Death;</hi> when a
Man dyeth, we say his Debts are paid: but here
Execution begins, then the Law takes the Sinner
by the Throat, and drags him to everlasting Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and doth in effect say, pay me what
thou owest. Death is God's Arrest. Assoon as
the Soul steps out of the World, presently 'tis at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
and seized, and forfeited into the Hands
of God's Justice. How many are there that lie
under this Danger and never think of it! Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Debts they are not so sensible of, as literal.
A Man that's deeply in debt, and in danger of an
Arrest, cannot sleep, eat, walk abroad, but his
Fears are upon him. <hi>Augustus</hi> bought his Quilt,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:47528:183"/>
or Bed, that could sleep soundly when he owed
so many thousand Sestercies. But poor sensless
Sinners never think of danger until they are
plunged into it, and then there's no escape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> The Metaphor will also hold good,
as to our <hi>Remedy</hi> and <hi>Recovery,</hi> how we come out
of this Debt. A Debtor that is insolvent, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
unless there be some means found out to
satisfy the Creditor: So we must altogether
lie under the Wrath of God, unless Satisfaction
be made. Therefore Jesus Christ, in the</p>
               <p>1. Place comes under the Notion of a <hi>Surety.</hi>
Because he took the Debt of Man upon himself,
therefore, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. he is called, <hi>The Surety of
a better Testament.</hi> When Christ undertook the
Business of our Salvation, he did in effect
say, as <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon;</hi> Vers. 18. <hi>If he hath
wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
Account:</hi> So did Jesus Christ, in effect say to
God; Let me be made a Sin, and made a Curse
for them. He that was a Judg, was willing to
become a Party, and to pay what we owed.
<hi>David</hi> in the Type of Christ, saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 4.
<hi>I restored that which I took not away.</hi> He did not
take away any Honour from God: It was we
that robbed God of the Glory of his Justice, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and Truth; that trampled them under
our Feet: but Christ made restitution and amends
to God.</p>
               <p>2. Having condescended to become our Surety,
he made full Satisfaction, by suffering the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was due to us; <hi>Isa. 53. 4. Surely he
hath born our Griefs, and carried our Sorrows.</hi>
That which we should have born upon our own
Backs, and would have crusht us for ever, that
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:47528:183"/>
he hath born, and he hath carried. Christ was
to be the Sinner in Law, and was to suffer in our
stead. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath a Passage concerning Surety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
<hi>Prov. 11. 15. He that is Surety for a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
shall smart for it:</hi> or, (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> will
bear it) sore-<hi>bruised,</hi> or, (as it is in the <hi>Margin</hi>)
shall be <hi>bruised</hi> and <hi>sore-broken.</hi> And the same
word is used concerning Christ, that was our
Surety; <hi>Isa. 53. 10. It pleased the Father to bruise
him.</hi> Christ is our Surety, therefore he was
bruised and broken, he suffered what we should
have suffered. It is true, there are some Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of our Punishment, which Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
not, (as a great part of our Punishment in
Hell, there's the Worm of Conscience, and
Dispair, and the Eternity of Torments) but
this was not essential to the Punishment, but did
only arise from the Guilt, and from the Weakness
of the Party that is punished, because we cannot
work through it otherwise. Christ paid the full
Price which Divine Justice demanded, and so
made Satisfaction for us.</p>
               <p>3. Christ satisfying as our Surety, all those
which had an Interest in his Death, they are set
free from the Wrath of God, they have a Release
from this great Debt owed. As when the Ram
was taken, <hi>Isaac</hi> was let go; so when Christ was
taken, the Sinner is released and discharged.
<hi>Iob 33. 24. Deliver him from going down to the Pit,
I have found a Ransom.</hi> Certainly God will not
exact the Debt twice, of the <hi>Surety,</hi> and of the
<hi>Principal</hi> Person; our Surety having paid the
Debt for us, therefore we go free. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if our Consciences should pursue us at Law,
we may answer, Christ was taken for us, <hi>He was
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:47528:184"/>
bruised for our Iniquities, and he bore the Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Christ hath not only satisfied for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
but he hath procured Favour for us;
wherein he differeth from an ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Surety. Christ does not only free us from
Bonds, but also hath brought us into Grace and
Favour with the Creator, Law-giver, and Judg.
There's a double Notion of Christ's Death;
that of a <hi>Ransom</hi> for the delivery of a Captive,
and as a <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Price</hi> which was given for
eternal Life. The Death of Christ did not only
dissolve the <hi>Obligation</hi> which lay upon us, to suffer
the Penalty for the Breach of the Law, and so
deliver us from the Wrath to come; but it was
a <hi>Price</hi> that was given to purchase Grace, Favour,
and Heaven for us, which is called, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 14.
<hi>The purchased Possession.</hi> Now why must our
Surety instate us thus into Favour? because Christ
was such a Surety, as did not only pay the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture,</hi>
but also the <hi>Principal,</hi> (that is) he did
not only make <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for the Trespass and
Offence (which is the Payment of the Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
but also he established a <hi>Righteousness</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to the Law (which is the Payment of the
Principal) and of that original Debt which God
first required of the Creature; for there's a
Debt of Duty and Service, which Christ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
and establisheth, as a Righteousness for
us.</p>
               <p>5. From hence in his Name there is proclaimed
Redemption to the Captives, Freedom to poor
Prisoners that were in Debt, and weak, and could
not acquit themselves. And therefore the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Gospel is compared to the Year of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:47528:184"/>
                  <hi>Iubilee;</hi> Luke 4. 19. <hi>Christ came to preach the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
Year of the Lord.</hi> It relates to the Year
of <hi>Iubilee,</hi> wherein all Debts were cancelled; it
was a Year of general Releasement, proclaimed
by sound of Trumpet, that every Man should
return to his Inheritance, and all Debts dissolved
and done away; <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 9, 10. So Jesus Christ
saith, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, to preach
the acceptable Year of the Lord:</hi> (that is) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
to poor Captives a Release of all Debts,
and all Bonds which are upon them.</p>
               <p>6. All those that <hi>come to God by Christ,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
in the Comfort of this Offer and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
of Grace, and may plead with God
about their Discharge from this great and heavy
Debt. I put it mainly in that Notion, (those
that come to God by Christ) because you will
find that's the Description of those whom Christ
means to save; <hi>Heb. 7. 25. He is able to save
them to the uttermost, that come unto God by him.</hi>
Who are those that come unto God by him?
Those that in Christ's Name, do seriously, and
with Brokenness of Heart, deal with him about
a Release and a Discharge. To <hi>come to God by
him,</hi> it is to come in his Name, to plead his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation,</hi>
or his <hi>Satifaction,</hi> as the only meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Cause; and the <hi>Promise</hi> of God in Christ to
blot out our Offences, as the only ground of Hope;
and as to our selves, acknowledging the Debt;
that is, in confessing our Sins, and our desert of
Punishment, with a purpose to forsake them.</p>
               <p>1. There is required an <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> of
the Debt. God stands upon it, that his Justice
may be owned with a due sense, according to the
Tenor of the first Covenant: For though the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:47528:185"/>
Satisfaction be made by another, and that by a
Surety of God's providing; yet God will have
the Creature know they are under so heavy a
Debt, that he will have them feel it in <hi>Broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of Heart; not know it only in a <hi>general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi>
but confess our Sins; 1 <hi>Iohn 1. 9. If we
confess our Sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
our Sins.</hi> When we come with true Remorse,
and confess we have offended so just, so holy,
so merciful a Father, it must be grievous to us in
the remembrance of it. You must not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
Sin as a <hi>Wrong,</hi> but as a <hi>Debt:</hi> Sin hath
wronged God, and it is also a Debt binding you
over to a Punishment we could never indure, nor
make God any Satifaction for. Therefore <hi>David</hi>
when he would have God's Bond crossed and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd,
see how he pleads; <hi>Psal. 51. 2, 3. O Lord,
blot out mine Offences, for I acknowledg my Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions;
and my Sin is ever before me.</hi> Blot it
out, for I acknowledg it; (that is) I submit to
thy instituted Course; I submit to the Justice of
the first Covenant.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Christ must be pleaded
also by a Sinner in the Court of Heaven, in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
manner, that there may be an owning
of the Surety. All Parties that are interested
in this Business must consent. Now God and
Christ they are agreed about the business of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
<hi>God</hi> hath agreed to <hi>take</hi> Satisfaction
from Christ, and <hi>Christ</hi> hath agreed to <hi>make</hi> this
Satisfaction to God: All the business now is
about the Sinner's Consent, or about his ready
Acceptation of Jesus Christ; and we never hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indeed consent to this, that Christ shall be
our Surety, and he the Person that must release
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:47528:185"/>
and discharge this Debt, until we look upon him
by an Eye of Faith, as one that tore the Bond
and Hand-writing that was against us. The <hi>Law</hi>
is called the <hi>Hand-writing</hi> that was against us;
there's the Bond which was to be put in suit:
now, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. He hath (torn, or) <hi>blotted out
the Hand-writing of Ordinances, that was against us,
which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way,
na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng it to his Cross.</hi> He hath disannull'd the
Law, which binds to suffer the Wrath of God.
The Law was the Bond by which our Death was
ratified.</p>
               <p>3. There is requir'd an unfeigned purpose to
<hi>forsake</hi> Sin. He that hath been released of his
Debt, must not still run into new Arrears.</p>
               <p>Christ never blotted out our Debts, that we
might renew them, and go on upon a new Score
of offending God again; this is to dally with
God, to run into the Snare, when he hath broken
it for us, and given us an escape, to plunge our
selves into new Debts again.</p>
               <p>In this Prayer, <hi>Forgive us our Debts,</hi> then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
<hi>Lead us not into Temptation.</hi> Therefore
we must purpose to forsake Sin, otherwise we
do not draw nigh to God with a <hi>true</hi> Heart;
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. We do but deal falsely with God in
all the Confessions we make, and in all the Pleas
of Faith, unless there be an unfeigned purpose
to renounce all Sin, and cast it off, as a thing
that will undo our Souls. Thus, Christians, must
you sue out your Release and Discharge in your
Surety's Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1. The Use is, first, to shew us the Misery
of an impenitent unpardoned Sinner, he hath a
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:47528:186"/>
vast Debt upon him that will surely undo him,
unless he doth in time get a Discharge. He is
bound over to suffer the Wrath of God for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
and no Hand can loose him but God's.
Many times they think of no such matter, and
cry, <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> to themselves; but it is not the
Debtor which must cancel the Book, but the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor.
Have you a discharge from God? where's
your legal Qualification? poor Creatures, what
will you do? Many take care that they may owe
nothing to any Man; Oh! but what do you owe
to God? To live in doubt, and in fear of an
Arrest, O what Misery is that! But when Sin lieth
at the Door, ready to attach you every moment,
and hale you to the Prison of Hell, that's most
dreadful. Therefore think of it seriously; how do
Accounts stand between God and you? Sinners are
loth to think of it. When the Lord came to reckon
with his Servants, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 24. it is said, <hi>One
was brought to him which ow'd him ten thousand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents:</hi>
He was loth to come to an account, he
would fain keep out of the way, but he was
<hi>brought</hi> to him. So we are unwilling to be call'd
to account, we shift and delay, and will not think
of our Misery: but the putting <hi>off</hi> Sin, will not
put it <hi>away;</hi> our not thinking of our Misery, will
not help us out, and will not be a Release and
Discharge.</p>
               <p>2. If Sins be Debts, and an increasing Debt,
so that Man is ever treasuring up Wrath against
the day of Wrath; it presseth us to be more
careful to get out of this Condition. Saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
Prov. 6. 3, 4, 5. If thou beest in debt, <hi>flee as a
swift Roe from the hand of the Hunter, and as a Bird
from the hand of the Fowler.</hi> O it's a sad thing to
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:47528:186"/>
lie in our Sins! If you be under this Debt, <hi>Give
not Sleep to thine Eyes, nor Slumber to thine Eye-lids;
get away like the swift Roe from the hand of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
&amp;c. And what I say concerning a <hi>State</hi> of
Sin, I say concerning <hi>daily Failings;</hi> make your
Peace with God betimes; if you have contracted
a new Debt, make all even between God and
your Souls, that you may not sleep in your Sins.</p>
               <p>3. This should make us more cautious that we
do not commit Sin: Why? it is a Debt that
will render you obnoxious to the Wrath of God;
in it self it merits eternal Death: O therefore sin
no more, do not run again into the Snare!
When you give way to Sin, you hazard the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of your Acquittance by Christ; <hi>Psal.</hi> 85. 8.
<hi>The Lord will speak Peace unto his People, and to his
Saints; but let them not turn again to Folly.</hi> If the
Lord hath given you your Peace, and some hope
of your being discharged of this heavy Debt, take
heed of medling with forbidden Fruit, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into debt again.</p>
               <p>2. From the Subject, or Persons which make
this Prayer, <hi>Forgive us,</hi> Observe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> Even those that call God Father, ought to
beg, daily and humbly, Pardon of their Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forgive Vs;</hi> who is that <hi>Vs</hi> that can say
in Faith, <hi>Our Father,</hi> daily. For this is a Patern
for daily Prayer, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Petition noteth. We need beg, for Christ
hath taught us here to sue out our Discharge.
In which begging there is an Exercise of <hi>Faith</hi>
eying Christ; <hi>Rom. 3. 25. God hath set forth him
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:47528:187"/>
to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood.</hi> And
there is an Exercise also of <hi>Repentance,</hi> as to
<hi>mourning</hi> for Sin; 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13.
<hi>He that confesseth and forsaketh his Sin, shall have
Mercy:</hi> and as to loathing of Sin; <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19.
<hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your Sins
may be blotted out.</hi> And certainly it must be <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
begged; for if we seek Pardon, we must seek
it in God's way. We do not beg God to rescind
and make void his Laws, and those wise Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
he hath appointed, whereby the Creature
shall receive this Grace; and the manner wherein
he will deal and transact this business with the
offending Creature: But we seek it, as exercising
our renewed Repentance; (that is) mourning
for Sin, and loathing of Sin. But of this more
hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now, that the best of God's Children should
be dealing with God about a Pardon of their Sins;
I shall argue it,
<list>
                     <item>1. From the Necessity.</item>
                     <item>2. The Utility and Profit of such a Course.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First;</hi> The <hi>Necessity</hi> of this will appear two
ways.</p>
               <p>1. From the Condition of God's Children here
in the World.</p>
               <p>2. From the way wherein God will give out a
Pardon.</p>
               <p>1. From the Condition of God's Children
here in this World. The best are not so fully san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
in this Life, but there is some Sin found in
them: Not only they who walk with no <hi>Care,</hi>
but even they that set the most <hi>narrow</hi> watch over
their Ways, they are not so sanctified, but they
need daily to go to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:47528:187"/>
(1.) They have <hi>Original</hi> Sin which remaineth
with them to the last, they have the sinning Sin
which the Apostle speaks of. <hi>Paul</hi> complains of
the body of Death; <hi>Rom. 7. 23, 24. Who shall
deliver me from it?</hi> The <hi>Hebrews</hi> were wont to
propound their Wishes by way of Question; as,
<hi>O that Salvation were come out of</hi> Sion! It is in the
Hebrew, <hi>Who shall bring Salvation out of</hi> Zion?
So, <hi>Who will lead me into</hi> Edom? That is, <hi>O that
I were led into</hi> Edom, that I might display the
Banner there, because of God's Truth. So, <hi>who
shall deliver me from the body of this Death?</hi> that is,
<hi>O that I were delivered!</hi> Where the Reign of Sin is
<hi>broken,</hi> yet there it remains; though it be cast
<hi>down</hi> in regard of <hi>Regency,</hi> yet it is not cast <hi>out</hi> in
regard of <hi>Inheritance.</hi> As the Ivy that is gotten
into the Wall, cut away the Boughs, Branches,
Stubs, yet still there will be some sproutings out
again, until the Wall be pulled down: So, until
these earthly Tabernacles of ours be tumbled in
the Dust, though we are mortifying and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
of Sin, yet there will be a budding and
sprouting out again.</p>
               <p>(2.) There are many <hi>Actual</hi> Sins. <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 2.
<hi>In many things we offend all.</hi> And, Eccles. 7. 20.
<hi>There is not a just Man upon Earth, that doth good,
and sinneth not:</hi> That is, that <hi>sins</hi> not either in
<hi>omitting</hi> of Good, or <hi>committing</hi> of Evil. Our
Offences are either total or partial. <hi>Partial</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences;
though a Child of God, loves God, fears
God, trusts in God, yet not in that Purity and
Perfection that he hath required of him: though
he serves God, and obeys him, yet not with
that Liberty, Delight, Reverence, which he hath
required. There is an Omission in part in every
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:47528:188"/>
Act: There is not that Perfection which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth,
who is to be served with all our Might,
with all our Strength. Our Principles are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
there is Flesh and Spirit: there is a mixture
in all our Actions. Sometimes there's a <hi>total</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
the spiritual Life is at a stand, many
times all Acts of respect are intermitted. Then
for <hi>Commissions;</hi> Sometimes out of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> they
do not see what is to be done. Though they
have a general Resolution to do the whole Will
of God, yet many times they mistake. Our
Light is but in part: <hi>And who can understand his
Errors?</hi> Psal. 19. 12. <hi>Cleanse me from secret Sins:</hi>
We sin out of Ignorance, as a Man in the dark
may justle against his Friend. Sometimes by <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence</hi>
and <hi>Inconsideration,</hi> as a Man that is not
heedful though he knows it, he may mistake his
way. Many are <hi>overtaken in a Fault;</hi> Gal. 6. 1.
(that is) unawares, and besides their Intention.
Sometimes out of <hi>Incogitancy</hi> and sudden <hi>Incursion,</hi>
they may not only be overtaken, but over-born,
<hi>drawn away by their own Lusts;</hi> James 1. 14. over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by the Prevalency of Passion and corrupt
Affection; so Sin gets the upper hand. Thus it is
with the Children of God. Look as it was said
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that in <hi>Battel</hi> they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
but never in War. Though a Child of
God hath the best of it at last, yet in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Conflicts he is over-born by the Violence
of Temptation, and his own corrupt Lusts. Thus
there's a necessity of begging daily Pardon if we
consider the Condition of the Saints while they
are here in the World, who carry a sinning Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
about them, a corrupt Issue that will never
be dried up while they are in the World; and
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:47528:188"/>
also they are guilty of many actual Sins, both of
Omission and Commission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> The necessity of it will appear from
the <hi>way</hi> wherein God gives a Pardon, which is
upon the Creatures humble <hi>Submission,</hi> and seeking
of Terms of Grace; so that whatsoever Right
we have to Remission in Christ, though we
have a <hi>general Right</hi> to remission and pardon of
Sin; yet we must seek to apply that Right, and
beg the use of it for our daily Pardon, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
with God. This will appear by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
1. The nature of this Request. 2. The
Right that a justified Person hath to the Pardon
of his daily Sins.</p>
               <p>1. What we beg for, when we say, <hi>Forgive us
our Sins:</hi> Five things we ask of God.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Grant of a Pardon.</item>
                  <item>2. The Continuance of this Priviledg.</item>
                  <item>3. The Sense and Comfort of it.</item>
                  <item>4. The Increase of that Sense.</item>
                  <item>5. The Effects of Pardon, or a Freedom from
those penal Evils, that are fruits of Sin.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. The <hi>Grant</hi> of a Pardon, That God would
accept the Satisfaction of Christ for our Sins, and
look upon us as righteous in him. Jesus Christ
himself was to sue out the Fruits of his Purchase;
<hi>Psal. 2. 8. Ask of me, and I will give thee the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
for thine Inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the
Earth for thy Possession.</hi> Though he had a Right
to be received into Heaven, to sit down at the
Right-hand of God, and administer the Kingdom
for the Comfort of his Elect Ones; yet, <hi>ask of me.</hi>
And so we are to sue out our Right; <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 5.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:47528:189"/>
                  <hi>I said, I will confess my Transgressions unto the Lord;
and thou forgavest the Iniquity of my Sin:</hi> What
then? <hi>For this cause shall every one that is godly pray
unto thee.</hi> Though God be so ready to forgive;
assoon as we conceive a purpose, he gives out a
Pardon, yet we are to call upon God. God will
have us to sue out the Grant of a Pardon; why?
because he would deal with us as a Soveraign,
therefore doth he require the Submission of our
Faith. It was of Grace that he would appoint
a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for us, which he did not for the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Angels; and it was much more Grace that
he would give that Satisfaction, give that Price
out of his own Treasury. Christ was not a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
of our choosing, but God's; and therefore
though Justice be fully satisfied, yet the Debt is
humbly to be acknowledged by the Creature, and
we are to sue out Terms of Grace. And again,
the Application to <hi>us</hi> is meerly Grace, when so
many thousands perish in their Sins; therefore
we are to beg, to sue out this Grace, that we may
have the benefit of Christ's Death. God doth
it, that in begging we may acknowledg our own
Misery, and how unable we are to make Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
<hi>Psal. 143. 2. In thy sight no Flesh can be
justified:</hi> And, <hi>Psal. 130. 3, 4. If thou shouldst mark
Iniquities; O Lord, who shall stand? But there is For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</hi> Before
God will give us an Interest in this Forgiveness,
we are to come and confess our selves utterly to
be insolvent, and also to own Jesus Christ as the
means, that we may solemnly and explicitly own
our Redeemer, who was appointed by God, and
procured this benefit for us; 1 <hi>Ioh. 2. 1. And if any
Man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Iesus
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:47528:189"/>
Christ the righteous.</hi> God hath required we should
sue it out, and own our Advocate, as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
our selves unable to satisfy, that we might
know who is our Advocate. In the Type of the
Brazen Serpent, <hi>Numb. 21. 8. And the Lord said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
Moses, <hi>Make thee a fiery Serpent, and set it upon a
Pole; and it shall come to pass, that every one that is
bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.</hi> Mark, tho
God set up a sign of Salvation, (as it is called else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where)
yet when you shall <hi>look</hi> upon him, you
shall live. So God would have us sue out the
Grant by looking to Christ, that so our Interest
may be established; <hi>Iohn 3. 14. And as</hi> Moses
<hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness; even so must the
Son of Man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in
him, should not perish, but have eternal Life.</hi> That
whosoever <hi>believeth in him,</hi> that was the intent
of looking upon it; that we might fix our Faith
on Christ, and come under the shelter of his Wing.
We beg, upon a sense of our own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the Acceptance of Christ's Satisfaction for us.</p>
               <p>2. We pray for the <hi>Continuance</hi> of Pardon;
though we are already justified, yet <hi>Forgive us
our Sins.</hi> As in daily Bread, though we have it
by us, and God hath stored us with Blessings in
our Houses, yet we beg the continuance and use
of it: so what ever Right we have to pardoning
Mercy, yet we beg the continuance of it, for two
reasons; <hi>Partly,</hi> because Justification is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
until the day of Judgment; but Mercy is
still in <hi>fieri</hi> (that is) God is still a doing; <hi>Acts</hi> 3.
19. <hi>That your Sins may be blotted out, when the times
of refreshing shall come from the Presence of the Lord.</hi>
Then are our Sins blotted out, then is this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
compleat. We read of Forgiveness in <hi>this</hi>
World, and Forgiveness in the World to <hi>come
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:47528:190"/>
Matth.</hi> 12. 32. Forgiven in <hi>this World,</hi> when
accepted to Grace and Favour with God;
and forgiven in the <hi>World</hi> to <hi>come,</hi> when
this Priviledg is compleat, and fully made
up to the Elect. Some Effects of Sin remain till
then; as Death, which came into the World by
Sin, remains upon the Body till then; then our
Sin is blotted out, when all the Fruits of it are
vanished and done away: so that whilst any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Evils that are introduced by Sin, remain, we
ought to pray for Pardon; that God would not
repent of his Mercy. Look as when we are in a state
of Sanctification, we pray for the continuance of
Sanctification, as well as the increase of it, because
of the Reliques of Sin; though our perseverance
in Grace and Sanctification be as much secured
by God's Promise, as our perseverance in God's
Favour, and the Gift of Justification: So we
pray for the continuance of Pardon, because the
Evils of Sin yet remain in part. And <hi>partly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God for our Exercise will make us feel the
smart of old Sins, which are already pardoned;
As an old Bruise, though it be healed, yet
ever and anon we may feel it upon change of
Weather. Accusations of Conscience may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
for Sins already pardoned; as <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 26.
<hi>Thou makest me possess the Iniquities of my Youth.</hi>
Though a Man be reconciled to God, and in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with him, yet the Sins of his Youth will
trouble him, after he hath obtained the Pardon of
them. God may make these return with a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and frightful appearance upon the Conscience,
their Visage may be terrible to look upon. Tho
these Sins are blotted out, Satan may make the
Remembrance of them very frightful; and God
in his holy, wise Dispensation may permit it for
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:47528:190"/>
our Humiliation. Though this be no intrenching
of the Pardon already past, yet it may exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
terrify the Soul, and over-cloud our Comfort,
and therefore we must beg the continuance of
this Benefit. Go to God, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.
6, 7. <hi>Remember, O Lord, thy tender Mercies, and
thy loving Kindness, for they have been ever of old:
Remember not the Sins of my Youth, nor my Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.</hi>
He begs God's ancient Mercies would
continue with him: He acknowledged he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Mercy of <hi>old,</hi> he could run up to Eternity,
that had been for <hi>ever</hi> of old; yet Lord, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
not against me the Sins of my Youth. When
the sense of old Sins are renewed, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
Petitions for the pardon of them. It is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
with God, when we are negligent, to permit
the Devil to make use of Affliction, to revive old
Sins, that they may stare afresh in the view of the
Eye of Conscience; therefore we had need to
beg the continuance of this Priviledg, for it is
not compleat. Though the Pardon it self be not
abrogated, yet the Comfort of it may be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched
upon, and old Sins may come, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
the Soul with a very hideous Aspect.</p>
               <p>3. We beg here the <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Manifestation</hi> of
Pardon, though it be not the only thing we pray
for. <hi>Forgive us our Sins,</hi> (that is) let us <hi>know</hi>
it: God may blot Sins out of <hi>his Book,</hi> when he
doth not blot them out of <hi>our Consciences.</hi> There's
the Book of Conscience, and the Book of God's
Remembrance. The Book of God's <hi>Remembrance</hi>
may be cancell'd (to speak after the manner of
Men); as soon as we believe and repent, then
the Hand-writing which was against us is torn;
but he blots it out of our <hi>Consciences,</hi> when the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:47528:191"/>
Worm of Conscience is kill'd, by the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Blood of Christ through the Spirit;
when we are <hi>sprinkled from an evil Conscience,</hi> as
the Expression is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. And <hi>David</hi> is
earnest with God for this Benefit, the sense of
his Pardon; <hi>Psal. 51. 8, 12. Make me to hear Ioy
and Gladness; that the Bones which thou hast broken
may rejoyce; and restore unto me the Ioy of thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Nathan</hi> had told him his Sins were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
yet he wanted the Joy of God's Salvation,
that ancient free Spirit, that comforting inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spirit he was wont to have. God may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
in <hi>Heaven,</hi> when he doth not forgive in our
<hi>sense</hi> and <hi>feeling;</hi> therefore we beg the Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of it by the Comforts of the Gospel</p>
               <p>4. We beg the <hi>Increase</hi> of that Sense, for this
Sense is given out in a different Latitude. Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Sense is not in all alike quick and lively: many
have only a probable Certainty, but have many
Doubts: Some have <hi>Comfort,</hi> but never arrive to
<hi>Peace.</hi> Comfort, you know, is that thing which
holds up it self against Encounters, when we are
confronted; so there may be many doubts, when
the preponderating part of the Soul inclineth to
Comfort. Some have <hi>Peace</hi> for the present,
rest from Trouble of Conscience; others have
<hi>Ioy,</hi> which is a degree above Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>5. We beg the <hi>Effects</hi> of Pardon, or Freedom
from those penal Evils, which are continued upon
God's Children, and are the Fruits of Sin. Clearly
this is intended, for we beg of God to pardon us
as we pardon others; (that is) fully, intirely
to <hi>forgive, forget.</hi> We beg of God to forgive us
our Sins; (that is) to mitigate those Troubles,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:47528:191"/>
Evils, and Afflictions, which are the Fruits of Sin.
It is true, when a Man is justified, the <hi>State</hi> of his
<hi>Person</hi> is altered; yet Sin is the same in it self, it
deserves all manner of Evils; therefore we beg
not only a Release from Wrath to come, but
from those other temporal Evils that dog us at
the Heels: <hi>Sin</hi> is the same still, though the <hi>Person</hi>
is not the same. It is still the Violation of a holy
Law, an Affront done to an holy God, an Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
upon the precious Soul; it brings a Blot
upon us, an Inclination to sin again; nay, it
brings eternal Death. Though it do not bring
<hi>eternal</hi> Death upon pardoned Persons, yet it may
occasion temporal Trouble. God hath still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
this Liberty in the Covenant. <hi>That he will
visit their Trangression with the Rod, and their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
with Stripes; nevertheless, my loving Kindness
will I not utterly take from him; nor suffer my Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to fail;</hi> Psal. 89. 32, 33. And Prov. 11. 31.
<hi>The Righteous shall be recompensed in the Earth:</hi>
That is, he shall smart for his Evil-doings. A
Child of God, when he sinneth against him, tho
he be not <hi>executed,</hi> yet he may be <hi>branded,</hi> he
may have a Mark of Shame put upon him, his
Pilgrimage may be made uncomfortable; and
these may be fully consistent with God's Grace
and Love. Therefore we beg a Release from these
penal Evils; that as the Guilt, so the Punishment
also my be abolished.</p>
               <p>2. The Right that a justified Person hath to
the Pardon of his daily Sins.</p>
               <p>Pardon of Sin is to be considered, 1. In the
Impetration of it. 2. The Offer. 3. The Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Application, or legal Absolution of the
Sinner.</p>

1. In the Impetration and Purchase of it: So
when, <hi>Heb. 10. 14. By one Offering he hath perfected
for ever them that are sanctified,</hi> there needed no
more to expiate them, to satify Justice.</p>
               <p>2. In the offer of it. So God hath proclaimed
Pardon, upon the Condition of Repentance:
<hi>Ezek. 33. 11. Say unto them, As I live, saith the
Lord God, I have no Pleasure in the Death of the
wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and
live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil Ways, for why
will ye die, O House of</hi> Israel?</p>
               <p>3. In the Judicial Application, or legal Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of a Sinner. God in Word hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the legal Absolution of every one that
believeth in Christ. Assoon as we repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
a threefold Benefit we have.</p>
               <p>1. The state of the Person is altered: He is a
Child of God; <hi>Iohn 1. 12. To as many as received
him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of
God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> He
hath full leave to call God Father, a kind of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
dealing from him: Translated from a
state of Wrath, to the state of Grace; from a
Child of the Devil, he is made a Child of God,
never to be cast out of his Family.</p>
               <p>2. The actual Remission of all past Sins; <hi>Rom.
3. 25. To declare his Righteousness for the Remission
of Sins that are past, through the Forbearance of God.</hi>
'T would be a Licence to sin, if his Sins were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
before committed.</p>
               <p>3. A Right to the Remission of daily Sins, or
free leave to make use of the Fountain of Mercy,
that is always running, and is opened in the House
of God for the Comfort of Believers; <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.
1. <hi>In that day there shall be a Fountain opened to the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:47528:192"/>
House of</hi> David, <hi>and to the Inhabitants of</hi> Jerusalem,
<hi>for Sin, and for Vncleanness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Utility and Profit of such a Course.
<hi>See Serm.</hi> on <hi>Psal. 32. 1. Serm.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> The Use is to press us to be often dealing
with God about the pardon of our Sins, by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and daily Humiliation: none are exempted
from bewailing the Evil of Sin. The Death of Christ
doth not put less Evil into Sin; it is still damning
in its own Nature; 'tis still the Violation of an
holy Law, an Affront to an holy God, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
to thy precious Soul. When Christ
paid the Price for our Sins, it was upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
That we should renew our Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
that we should sue out our Discharge
in his Name, that when we sin, we may come and
humble our selves before the Lord. Under the
Law, if a Man were unclean, he was to wash his
Cloaths before Evening: He was not to sleep in
his Uncleanness. So if you have desiled your
selves, you should go wash in the Laver that God
hath appointed. The Lord taught his People
under the Law, of repeating a daily Sacrifice,
Morning and Evening. If one be fallen out with
another, God hath advised us, before the Sun be
set, to go and be reconciled to our Brother: and
wilt thou lie under the Wrath of God for one
Night? If we would oftner use this Course, the
Work of Repentance would not be so hard.
Wounds are best cured at first, before they are
suffered to fester and rankle into a Sore:
So are Sins before they grow longer upon us.
And if we did oftner thus reckon with our selves,
we should have less to do when we come to die.
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:47528:193"/>
Therefore do as wise Merchants, at the Foot of
every Page, draw up the Account, so help it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
So it will not be hard to sum up a long
Account, and reckon up our whole Lives, and
beg a Release of all our Debts; therefore daily
come and humble your selves before the Lord.
The oftner you do this, the sooner you will have
the Comfort of Pardon; but when you keep off
from God, and delay, you suffer the loss of Peace,
and the loss of God's Favour; and Hardness of
Heart, and Atheism, and carnal Security increase
upon you.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>As we forgive our Debtors.</head>
               <p>I come to the last Branch. Hence observe;</p>
               <p>Doct. 3. <hi>Those that would rightly pray to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
of God, they must forgive others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, I shall give you the Explication. 2. The
Reasons.</p>
               <p>For Explication, I shall speak to three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Who are Debtors.</item>
                  <item>2. What respect our forgiving of others, hath
to God's forgiving of us.</item>
                  <item>3. In what manner we must forgive others.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>First;</hi> Who are our Debtors. It is not meant
in a vulgar Sence, of those only which stand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
for a Sum of Mony due to us; but of all
such as have offended us in Word or Deed.
There is a Duty we owe to one another, which
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:47528:193"/>
when we omit, or act contrary unto it, we are
not only Debtors to God, but to one another:
and the Doers of the Injury are bound to repair
the Wrong, and to make Restitution. In this
large sence is the word <hi>Debtors</hi> here taken,
with respect to the Person that hath done the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury:
He becomes a Debtor, is to make Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and suffer the Punishment which the
Wrong deserves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> What Respect hath our forgiving
of others to God's forgiving us.</p>
               <p>I shall speak to it Negatively, and Positvely.</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>Negatively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. It is not a <hi>meritorious</hi> Cause, or a Merit and
Price given to God why he should pardon us, for
that's only the Blood of Christ. Every Act of
ours is due, it is imperfect, and no way propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
to the Mercies we expect; and therefore
it cannot be meritorious before God. It is <hi>due,</hi>
it is a Duty we are bound to do, and paying of
new Debts doth not quit old Scores. God hath
laid such a Law upon us, that we are to forgive
others; that cannot expiate former Offences.
And it is <hi>imperfect</hi> too: The Remembrance of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
sticks too close to us. When we do most
heartily and intirely forgive others, even then
we have too great a sense of the Injury and
Wrong that is offered to us. Now that which
<hi>needs</hi> Pardon, cannot <hi>deserve</hi> Pardon. And it is
<hi>disproportionate</hi> to the <hi>Mercy</hi> which we expect.
What a vast Disparity and Difference is there
between God's pardoning of us, and our pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of others? whether we respect the Persons
that are interrested in this Action; or the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>b<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
Matter, or Manner and way of doing; or
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:47528:194"/>
the Fruit and Issue of the Action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> In the Persons <hi>pardoning:</hi> what Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can there be between God and Men? the
Creator and the Creature? God he is most
free, and bound to none, of infinite Dignity
and Perfection, which can neither be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
or lessened by any Act of ours, for him
or against him: but we live in perfect Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon God's Pleasure, are subject to his
Command, and bound to do his Will: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
what is our forgiving our fellow Creatures,
made out of the same Dust, animated by the
same Soul, and every way equal with us by Nature,
when they wrong us in our petty Interests? what
Proportion is there between this forgiving and
God's forgiving? he that is of so infinite a Majesty,
his forgiving the Violations of his holy Law?</p>
               <p>And <hi>2ly,</hi> To the <hi>subject Matter,</hi> that which is
forgiven, there is no Proportion. When we
compare the Multitude or Magnitude, the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and the Number of Offences forgiven of the
one side and the other, we see there's a mighty
Disproportion; we forgive Pence, and God Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents;
we an hundred Pence, he ten thousand
Talents; <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>So <hi>3dly,</hi> the <hi>manner</hi> of forgiving: on God's
part, by discharging us freely, and exacting a full
Satisfaction from Christ; therefore our forgiving
can hold no Comparison with it, which is an
Act of Duty, and Conformity to God's Law.</p>
               <p>And <hi>4thly,</hi> As to the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Issue</hi> of the
Action; our Good and Evil doth not reach to
God. Though our forgiving of others be an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Profit to our selves, yet no Fruit redounds
to God. And therefore there being no Proportion
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:47528:194"/>
between finite and infinite, there can be no such
proportion between our forgiving and God's
forgiving, as that this Act may be meritorious
before God. Thus it is not brought here as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as that which doth oblige and bind God me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriously
to forgive us.</p>
               <p>2. It is not a <hi>Patern</hi> or <hi>Rule.</hi> We do not mean,
our forgiving should be a Patern of forgiving to
God. So [<hi>as</hi>] is taken indeed, ver. 10 <hi>Thy
Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven;</hi> there it
implies a Conformity to the Patern. But when
we say, <hi>Forgive us, as we forgive;</hi> it doth not
mean here a Patern or Rule. We imitate God,
but God doth not imitate us, in forgiving Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And it would be ill with us, if God should
forgive us no better than we forgive one another.
God is matchless in all his Perfections; there is
no Work like his. <hi>Psal.</hi> 86. 8. As God is match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in other Things, so in pardoning Mercy. <hi>As
the Heavens are above the Earth, so are his Ways a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
our Ways, and his Thoughts above our Thoughts.
Isa.</hi> 55. 9. And upon this very occasion the Lord
will multiply to pardon. <hi>As far as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi>
&amp;c. This is the greatest Distance we can
conceive. The Heavens, they are at such a vast
distance from the Earth, that the Stars, tho they
be great and glorious Luminaries, yet they seem
to be but like so many Spangles and Sparks:
This is the distance and disproportion which is
made between God's Mercy and ours. <hi>Hos.</hi> 11. 9.
<hi>I will not return to destroy</hi> Ephraim; <hi>for I am God,
and not Man.</hi> If God should forgive but only as
Man doth, it would be ill for <hi>Ephraim,</hi> if he
had to do with revengeful Man. God acteth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Infiniteness of his own Nature,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:47528:195"/>
far above the Law, and manner of all created
Beings. Therefore it is not put here as a Patern
and Rule.</p>
               <p>3. It doth not import <hi>Priority of Order,</hi> as if
<hi>our</hi> Act had the precedency of <hi>God's;</hi> or as if we
did or could heartily forgive others, before God
hath shewed any Mercy to us. No, in all Acts of
Love God is first; his Mercy to us, is the Cause
of our Mercy to others. As the Wall reflects
and casts back the Heat upon the Stander-by,
when first warmed with the Beams of the Sun:
So, when our Hearts are melted with a sense of
God's Mercy, his Love to us is the Cause of our
Love and Kindness to others. 1 <hi>Iohn 4. 19. We
love him, because he first loved us;</hi> that is, we love
him, and others for his sake: For Love to God
implies that; why? because he hath been first
with us. And then it is the <hi>Motive</hi> and <hi>Patern</hi>
of it. In that Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 32, 33. God's
forgiving is the Motive to our forgiving: <hi>I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave
thee all thy Debt; and shouldest not thou have
compassion on thy Fellow-Servant?</hi> In those that
have true Pardon, it causeth them to forgive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
out of a sense of God's Mercy (that is)
they are disposed and inclined to shew Mercy to
others. But in others, that think themselves par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
and have only a temporary Pardon and
Reprieve, (such as is there spoken of) it is a
<hi>Motive</hi> which should prevail with them, tho it
doth not. Nay, it is the <hi>Patern</hi> of our Love to
others: <hi>Eph. 4. 32. Forgiving one another, even
as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you;</hi> in that
manner, and according to that Example.</p>
               <p>4. It doth not import an exact <hi>Equality,</hi> but
some kind of Resemblance. <hi>As,</hi> it is a Note
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:47528:195"/>
of Similitude, not Equality, either of <hi>Measure</hi> or
<hi>Manner;</hi> it only implieth, that there is some
correspondent Action, something like done on
our part. So, <hi>Luke 6. 36. Be merciful,</hi> [as] <hi>your
heavenly Father is merciful. As,</hi> notes the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Truth, tho not the exact proportion;
there will be something answerable to God.</p>
               <p>(2.) But <hi>positively,</hi> to shew what respect it
hath.</p>
               <p>1. It is a <hi>Condition</hi> or moral <hi>Qualification</hi> which
is found in Persons pardoned. <hi>Mat. 6. 14. For
if ye forgive Men their Trespasses, your heavenly
Father will also forgive you:</hi> But, ver. 15. <hi>If ye
forgive not Men their Trespasses, neither will your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forgive your Trespasses.</hi> These two are inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
conjoin'd, God's pardoning of us, and
our pardoning of others. The Grant of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
that's given out at the same time when this
Disposition is wrought in us; but the Sense of a
Pardon, that's a thing subsequent to this Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
And when we find this Disposition in us,
we come to understand how we are pardoned of
God.</p>
               <p>2. It is an Evidence, a Sign or Note of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
Sinner; when a Man's Heart is entender'd
by the Lord's Grace, and inclined to shew Mercy;
here's his Evidence: <hi>Mat. 5. 7. Blessed are the
merciful, for they shall obtain Mercy.</hi> The Stamp
or Impression shews that the Seal hath been there;
so this is an Evidence to us, whereby we may
make out our Title to the Lord's Mercy, that we
have received Mercy from the Lord.</p>
               <p>3. It is a necessary Effect of God's pardoning
Mercy shed abroad in our Hearts; for Mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
Mercy, as Heat doth Heat. <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 2, 3.
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:47528:196"/>
                  <hi>Shew meekness to all Men; for we our selves also
were sometimes foolish, disobedient,</hi> &amp;c. There's
none so tender to others, as they which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Mercy themselves; that know how gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God hath dealt with them, and did not take
the advantage of their Iniquity.</p>
               <p>4. It is put here, to shew that it is a Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
upon them that are pardoned. God
hath laid this Necessity upon Men. And that may
be one reason why this Clause is inserted, that
every time we come to pray, and beg Pardon, we
may bind our selves to this Practice, and warn
our selves more solemnly of our Duty, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
it in the sight of God. So that when we
say, <hi>Forgive us our Debts, as we forgive our Debtors,</hi>
it is a certain Undertaking, or solemn Promise
we make to God, if he will shew mercy to us,
this will incline us to shew mercy to others. In
earnest Requests, we are wont to bind our selves
to necessary Duties.</p>
               <p>5. It is an Argument breeding <hi>Confidence</hi> in
God's pardoning Mercy. When we that have so
much of the old Leaven, that soure revengeful
Nature in us, yet when we have received
but a Spark of Grace, it makes us ready to forgive
others; then what may we imagine in God!
What is our Drop, to that infinite Sea of Fulness
that is in him! Clearly thus it is urged in that
Clause, <hi>Luke 11. 4. And forgive us our Sins; for
we also forgive every one that is indebted to us.</hi> There
is a special <hi>Emphasis</hi> upon that [<hi>For we also</hi>];
that is, we that have so little Grace, we that
are so revengeful and passionate by Nature, we
also forgive those that are indebted to us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the gracious God, in all Goodness, and in all
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:47528:196"/>
moral Perfections, doth far exceed the Creature;
and if this be in us, what is there in God? This
kind of Reasoning is often used in Scripture; as,
Mat. 7. 11. <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give
good Gifts unto your Children; how much more shall
your Father which is in Heaven, give good Things
to them that ask him?</hi> If evil Men have such Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
and Affections towards their Children, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there's more of this Goodness and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> Wherein this forgiving of others doth
consist?</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In forbearing others.</item>
                  <item>2. In acquitting others.</item>
                  <item>3. In doing good to them.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. In <hi>forbearing</hi> one another, and with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our selves from Revenge. This is a thing
that is distant from forgiving, and accordingly
we shall find it so propounded by the Apostle,
<hi>Col. 3. 13. Forbearing one another, and forgiving one
another, if any Man have a Quarrel against any;
even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.</hi> Mark,
there's first forbearing, and then forgiving.
What is <hi>forbearing?</hi> a ceasing from Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
which tho they be sweet to Nature, yet
they are contrary to Grace. Some Men will say, we
will do to him, as he hath done to us. <hi>Prov.
24. 29. Say not, I will do so to him, as he hath done
to me; I will render to the Man according to his
Work.</hi> Corrupt Nature thirsteth for Revenge,
and hath a strong Inclination this way; but
Grace should give check to it: <hi>Say not,</hi> &amp;c. Men
think it's a base thing, and argueth a low pusilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
Spirit, to put up Wrongs and Injuries;
O it argueth a stupid Baseness. But this is that
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:47528:197"/>
which giveth a Man a Victory over himself; nay,
it gives a Man the truest Victory over his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
when he forbears to revenge. It gives a
Man a Victory over himself, which is better than
the most noble Actions amongst the Sons of Men.
Prov. 16. 32. <hi>He that overcometh his own Spirit, is
more than he that taketh a City.</hi> There is a Spirit
in us, that is boisterous, turbulent, and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
apt to retaliate, and return Injury for Injury;
now when we can bridle this, this is an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
of our own Spirits. But that's the true
weakness of Spirit, when a Man is easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by his own Passion: And then hath our
Enemy a true Victory over us, when his Injuries
overcome us so far, as we can break God's Laws
to be quit with him. Therefore the Apostle
saith, <hi>Rom. 12. 21. Be not overcome of Evil, but
overcome Evil with Good.</hi> Then is Grace victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and then hath a Man a noble and brave Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
not when he is overcome by Evil, (for that
argueth Weakness) but when he can overcome
Evil. And it is God's way to shame the Party
that did the wrong, and to overcome him too; it
is the best way to get the Victory over him.
When <hi>David</hi> had <hi>Saul</hi> at an advantage in the
Cave, and cut off the Lap of his Garment, and
did forbear any Act of Revenge against him, <hi>Saul</hi>
was melted, and said to <hi>David, Thou art more
righteous than I.</hi> 1 Sam. 24. 17. Tho he had such
a hostile Mind against him, and chased and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
him up and down; yet when <hi>David</hi> forbore
Revenge, when it was in his Power, it overcame
him, and he falls a weeping. So the Captains of
the <hi>Syrians,</hi> when the Prophet had blinded them,
and led them from <hi>Dothan</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> what saith
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:47528:197"/>
the King of <hi>Israel?</hi> he is ready to kill them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently:
No, 2 <hi>Kings 6. 22. Set Bread and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before them, that they may eat and drink, and go
to their Master.</hi> He was kind to them; and what
followeth? <hi>They did no more annoy Israel.</hi> This
wrought upon the Hearts of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> so that
they would not come and trouble them any
more.</p>
               <p>2. In Forgiving, it is not only required of
Christians to forbear the avenging of themselves,
but also actually to forgive and pardon those that
have done them Wrongs. They must not only
<hi>forbear</hi> Acts of Revenge, but all Desires of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
must be <hi>rooted</hi> out of their Hearts. Men
may tolerate or forbear others, for want of a
handsom Opportunity of executing their Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
But the Scripture saith, <hi>Forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
forgiving one another.</hi> This Forgiving im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth
the laying down of all <hi>Anger,</hi> and <hi>Hatred,</hi>
and all <hi>Desire</hi> of Revenge. Now this should be
done, not only in word, but sincerely and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally.</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>Sincerely,</hi> and with the Heart. In the
Conclusion of that Parable, Christ doth not say,
If you do not <hi>forgive,</hi> thus it shall be done to you;
but, <hi>If ye from your Hearts forgive not every one
his Brother their Trespasses; so also shall my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father do to you.</hi> We must not only do
this, but do it from the <hi>Heart. Ioseph,</hi> when his
Brethren came to him, and submitted themselves,
did not only remit the Offence, but his Bowels
yearned towards them, and his Heart was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 17. Then,</p>
               <p>(2.) It must be done <hi>universally,</hi> whatever the
Wrong be, be it to our Persons, Names, or
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:47528:198"/>
Estates. To our <hi>Persons:</hi> Acts 7. 60. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
when they stoned him, he said, <hi>Lord, lay not this
Sin to their Charge:</hi> Tho they had done him so
great an Injury, as to deprive him of his Life and
Service; yet, <hi>Lord, lay not this Sin to their charge.</hi>
So to our <hi>Names:</hi> When <hi>Shimei</hi> came barking
against <hi>David;</hi> the poor Man was driven out of
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> by a rebellious Son, and this wicked
Wretch takes advantage against <hi>David,</hi> and rails
at him; yet <hi>David</hi> forgives him, when restored
to his Crown: <hi>He shall not die,</hi> 2 Sam. 19. 23.
Nay, <hi>he sware to him.</hi> So his <hi>Estate:</hi> When a
Debtor is not able to pay, and yet submits. So
<hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Philemon</hi> to forgive the Wrongs of <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus;
Put it on my Score,</hi> Philem. Vers. 18. that
is, for my sake forgive this Wrong.</p>
               <p>3. We must be ready to perform all Offices of
<hi>Love</hi> to them. <hi>Luke 6. 27. Love your Enemies, do
good to them which hate you.</hi> Mark, do not only
forbear to execute your <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi> upon
them, but <hi>do good</hi> to them, yea, tho they be <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
upon a religious ground; tho Religion be
made a Party in the Quarrel, and so engage us
to the greater Fury; when that which should
bridle our Passions, is the Fuel of them: <hi>Pray for
them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.</hi>
Mat. 5. 44. <hi>Miriam,</hi> when she had wronged
<hi>Moses,</hi> yet he falls a praying for her, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.
13. that the Lord would forgive the Sin, and heal
her.</p>
               <p>For the Reasons, why those that would rightly
pray to be forgiven of God, must forgive others.
It should be so, it will be so; there is a Congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
and a Necessity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:47528:198"/>
1. The Congruency, it <hi>should</hi> be so. It is fit
that he that <hi>beggeth</hi> Mercy, should <hi>shew</hi> Mercy;
it is exceedingly congruous: For this is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rule, <hi>That we should do as we would be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;</hi>
and therefore if we <hi>need</hi> Mercy from God,
we should shew Mercy to others; and without it
we can never pray in Faith. He that doth not
exercise Love, can never pray in Faith; why?
His own revengeful Disposition will still prejudice
his Mind, and make him conclude against the
Audience of his Prayers; for certainly we muse
on others, as we use our selves. And that's one
reason of our Unbelief, why we are so hardly
brought to believe all that tender Mercy which is
in God, because 'tis so irksom to us to forgive seven
times a day; we are apt to frame our Conclusions
according to the Dispositions of our own Heart.
Can we think God will forgive, when we our
selves will not forgive? A Man's own Prayers
will be confuted. What is more equal, than to
do as we would be done unto? And therefore it
is but equal, if he entreat Mercy for himself, he
should shew it unto others. Look as the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
reasoned of God's <hi>Power,</hi> from the Command
that he had over his Souldiers: <hi>Mat. 8. 9. I am
a Man under Authority, and I say to one, Go, and
he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh.</hi>
Those things we are accustomed to, they are apt
to run in our Minds, when we come to think of
God. Now he that kept his Souldiers under
Discipline, that if he said, <hi>Go, they go;</hi> he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
thus of God: Surely God hath Power to
chase away Diseases. So accordingly should we
reason of God's Mercy, according to the Mercy
that we find in our selves. Therefore it is very
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:47528:199"/>
notable, that when Christ had spoken of forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our Brethren, not only seven times, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
times seven, the Disciples said unto the
Lord, <hi>Increase our Faith,</hi> Luke 17. 5. How dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
this come in? In the 4<hi>th</hi> Verse Christ had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that they should forgive not only seven
times, but seventy times seven; and they do not
say, Lord, increase our <hi>Charity,</hi> but our <hi>Faith;</hi>
implying, that we cannot have such large thoughts
of God, when our own Hearts are so straitned by
Revenge, and our private Passions.</p>
               <p>2. In point of <hi>Necessity;</hi> as it should be so, so
it will be so; for God's Mercy will have an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon us, to make us merciful. All God's
Actions to us imprint their stamp in us; his <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of us, makes us to choose him, and his ways;
his <hi>Love</hi> to us, makes us love him again, who hath
loved us first; so his <hi>forgiving</hi> of us, makes us to
forgive our Brethren. There is an answerable
Impression left upon the Soul to every act of God
(why?) for a true Believer is God's Image: <hi>The
new Man is created after God,</hi> Eph. 4. 24. and
therefore he acts as God. Certainly, if there be
such a Disposition in our Heavenly Father, it
will be in us if we have an Interest in him. Look,
as a Child hath Part for Part, and Limb for Limb
answerable to his Father, tho not so big in Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Bulk; so hath a Child of God, which is
created after God, he hath all the Divine Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in some measure in his Soul. And this
Consideration is of more force, because the New-Creature
cannot be maimed and defective in every
Part, but is entire, lacking nothing. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if God forgive others, certainly the Godly
will be inclinable to forgive too.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:47528:199"/>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Here's a ground of Tryal whether we
are pardoned or no. Is our revengeful Disposition
(that is so natural, and so pleasing to us) morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?
That's one Trial or Evidence whether we
are forgiven of God; can we freely from the Heart
forgive others?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be objected against this. Do
you place so much in this property of forgiving
others? It doth not agree only to pardoned Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
because we see some Carnal Men are of a
weak and stupid Spirit, not sensible of Injuries:
And (on the other side) many of God's Children
find it hard to obtain to the perfect Oblivion of
Injuries that is required of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> As to the first part, I answer: We do not
speak of this Disposition as proceeding from an
<hi>easy</hi> Temper, but as it proceedeth from <hi>Grace;</hi>
when in Conscience towards God, and out of a
Sense of his Love to us in Christ, our Hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tendered and melted towards others, to shew
them such Mercy as we our selves have received
from the Lord; that's the Evidence. And again,
we do not press to judg by this Evidence <hi>single</hi>
and <hi>alone,</hi> but in Conjunction with <hi>others;</hi> when
they are humbly Penitent, and confessing their
Sins, and turn to the Lord, which is the great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Condition. Job. 33. 27. <hi>If any, say I have
sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
me not:</hi> Then will he restore light to him.
When a Man is soundly touched with remorse,
and seeth the folly of his former Courses, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Pardon of God, then is God gracious to him.
But this is that we say, that this Disposition of
Pardon, in Conjunction with the great Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:47528:200"/>
Condition of Faith and Repentance, it help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to make the Evidence more clear.</p>
               <p>2. As to the other part of the Objection, which
was this, it will be a great weakening of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of God's Children, who cannot get such a
perfect Oblivion of Injuries they have received,
but find their Minds working too much this way.</p>
               <p>I answer; As long as we live in the World,
there will be Flesh and Spirit, Corruption as well
as Grace; there will be an intermixture of the
Operations of each: Carnal Nature is prone to
Revenge; but Grace prevaileth, and inclineth to
a Pardon. Well then, if this be the prevalent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the Soul, and that which we strive by
all good Means to cherish in us, this meek Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
passing by of Wrongs we receive by others,
then we may take Comfort by this Evidence, tho
there be some reluctancies and regrudgings of the
old-Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. To press us to this ready Inclination
to forgive Wrongs and Injuries. We are not so
perfect, but we all need it from one another. There
will be mutual Offences while we are in the
World, especially in a time when Religious Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
are on Foot; therefore it concerns us to
look after this Disposition of forgiving others, as
we would be forgiven of God. Human Society
cannot well be upheld without this mutual For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
and Forgiving. Now imitate your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father. No Man can wrong us so much as
we daily trespass against him, and yet God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth
us. He doth not only pardon the lesser
Failings, some Venial Errors, and Sins of Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitancy
and sudden Surreption, which creep upon
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:47528:200"/>
us we know not how; but he pardons the greatest
Sins, <hi>tho they be as Scarlet,</hi> Isa. 1. 18. Those that
are of a Crimson hue, God can wash them out in
the Blood of Christ. And mark, what is it then
that you will stand upon? Is it the <hi>greatness</hi> of the
Offence? God pardons great Sins. Or is it the
<hi>baseness</hi> of those that injure you? (this is the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance)
When we have received wrong from
those which are our Inferiors, that owe us more
Reverence and Respect? What are we to God?
Notwithstanding the baseness of those which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
him daily, all Men to him are but as <hi>the drop
of the Bucket, and the small Dust of the Ballance,</hi> Isa.
40. 15. yet God pardons them. And then again,
cast in the consideration of God's <hi>Omnipotency:</hi> He
is able to right himself of the wrongs done to him,
and no Man can call him to an account: Many
times it is not in our Power. <hi>He can cast Body and
Soul into Hell,</hi> Mat. 10. 28. God is thus offended,
and by sawcy Dust that is ready to fly in his Face,
inconsiderable Man; and yet the Lord pardons,
and this he doth <hi>freely,</hi> Luke 7. 42. <hi>He frankly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave
them both.</hi> And he pardons <hi>fully,</hi> as if it
were never committed, Mich. 7. 19. <hi>He casts all
our Sins into the Depths of the Sea.</hi> Then he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
<hi>frequently,</hi> His <hi>Free Gift is of many Offences
unto Iustification,</hi> Rom. 5. 16. And <hi>he multiplies
to pardon,</hi> Isa. 55. 7. And mark, he pardons too
(in some sence) before they Repent, there's a
Purpose; he provided Christ before we were
born. And he gives us Grace to repent, or else
we could never humble our selves at <hi>his</hi> Feet, the
<hi>offended God;</hi> he gives them the Grace whereby
they shall acknowledg the Offence. Christ pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his Persecutors, when they had no sense of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:47528:201"/>
the Injury they had done him, they were convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by that Prayer afterwards, Luke 23. 34. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
forgive them, for they know not what they do;</hi>
therefore certainly much more when they repent
and submit. Oh therefore, let us not be drawn
hardly to this Duty; or at least we should not
upon every petty Offence cherish Hatred and
Rancor against our Brethren.</p>
               <p>But here are certain Cases that would come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
debate.</p>
               <p>First <hi>Case,</hi> Whether it be consistent with this
Temper, <hi>forgiving of others;</hi> to seek reparation of
wrongs in a way of Justice, and pursue Men at
Law for Offences they have committed against us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> Yes. For,</p>
               <p>1. Certainly one Law doth not cross another.
By the Law of <hi>Charity,</hi> the Law of <hi>Iustice</hi> is not
made void. A Magistrate (tho he be a Christian,
and bound to forgive others) is not bound up
from executing his Office against publick Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
Nor yet are private Men tyed from having
recourse to the Magistrate for restoration to their
Right, or reparation of their Wrong. For to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ones Right, is not contrary to Love; nor to
seek to amend and humble the Party Nocent by
the Magistrates Authority, who is <hi>the Minister of
God for Good,</hi> Rom. 13. 4. And that <hi>others may
hear and fear,</hi> Deut. 19. 20. And the Party dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
may for the future live in Peace. <hi>Forgiving</hi>
is an Act of <hi>private</hi> Jurisdiction. The Offence, as
far as it is private to us, it may be forgiven; but
there are many such Offences as are not only an
Offence to us, but to the Publick Order, and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:47528:201"/>
that must be left to the Process of the Law.</p>
               <p>2. Whosoever useth this Remedy, must look
to his own Heart, that he be not acted with private
<hi>Revenge,</hi> nor with a Spirit of <hi>Rigor,</hi> or <hi>Rankor</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Party offending; but that he be carried
out with Zeal to Justice, with pity to the Person,
that he and others may not be hardned in Sin.
For this is the general Law of Christ, <hi>That all
things should be done in Love,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 14. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when we are acted by our private Passion,
and secret desires of Revenge, we abuse God's
Ordinance of Magistracy, and make it to Lacquey
upon our Lusts. And therefore there must be a
taking heed to the frame of our own Hearts, that
they be upright in these things. Tho it seem
hard to Flesh and Blood, yet remember Flesh and
Blood shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.
Grace must frame your Hearts to the Obedience
of God's Will.</p>
               <p>3. These Remedies from Authority must be in
weighty Cases, and in matters of moment and
importance. Their contending in Law one with
another about the smallest matters, is that which
the Apostle taxeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7. Not upon every
trifling occasion. It must be after other means are
tryed and used; as the help of Friends to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the matter, for Charity tryeth all things,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. And the Apostle saith, 1 Cor. 6. 5.
<hi>Is there none to judg between you?</hi> that is, none to
decide and arbitrate the difference; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
to Authority should be our last Remedy.
And it must be too when the Party wronging is
<hi>able</hi> to make Satisfaction; otherwise it is Rigor
and Inhumanity: 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4 1. As <hi>When the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
came to take the Sons of the Widow for Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:47528:202"/>
When you are rigorous with those that
come to Poverty not by their own Default, but
by the discharge of their Duty brought Poverty
upon themselves, 'tis contrary to Christianity.
Look, as Physicians deal with Quick-Silver, after
many Distillations they make it useful in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines:
So, after many preparations is this Course
to be taken.</p>
               <p>2. Another Case; Whether in forgiving Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
we are bound to tarry for the Repentance of
the Party? The ground of doubting is, because
Christ saith, Luke 17. 3. <hi>If thy Brother trespass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee, rebuke him; and, if he repent, forgive him;</hi>
and because of God's Example, who doth not
forgive an obstinate Sinner, but him that repents.
Certainly, even <hi>before</hi> Repentance, we are bound
to lay aside Revenge, and in many cases to go and
reconcile our selves with others. Saith our Saviour,
<hi>If thou hast ought against any one, go reconcile thy self
to him, and then come and offer thy Gift.</hi> It is not
said, if any have ought against thee; but, if thou
hast ought against any one. I confess, in some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it is enough to lay it aside before the Lord.
But at other times, we are to seek reconciliation
with the Party which hath wronged us. But this
Case is mightily to be guided by Spiritual Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
As for God's Example, God is Superior,
bound to none, he acts freely, it is his Mercy that
pardons any; and yet God gives us a Heart to
repent, of his good Pleasure, he begins with a
Sinner. But this is nothing to our Case who are
under Law, who are bound to forgive others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:47528:202"/>
III. The Person to whom we Pray. <hi>Our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Note</hi> is, That God doth alone forgive Sin.</p>
               <p>There is a double forgiveness of Sin: In Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and in a Mans own Conscience; and therefore
sometimes compared to the blotting out of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
out of a Book, sometimes to the blotting
out of a Cloud. To the blotting out of a Book.
Isa. 43. 25. <hi>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
Transgressions, for mine own sake, and will not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thy Sins;</hi> That it may be no more remembred,
or charged upon us. To the blotting out of a
Cloud: Isa. 44. 22. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick
Cloud thy Transgressions, and as a Cloud, thy Sins.</hi>
As the Sun when it breaketh forth in its Strength,
dispelleth the Mists and Clouds. Sin interposeth
as a Cloud, hindring the Light of God's Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
from shining forth upon us. Both these are
God's Work; to blot the Book, and to blot out
the Cloud.</p>
               <p>1. Pardoning of Sin in the Court of Heaven,
it belongeth to God peculiarly. Dan. 9. 9. <hi>To the
Lord our God belong Mercies and Forgivenesses,</hi> &amp;c.
'Tis God alone can do it, for two Reasons.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He is the wronged Party.</item>
                  <item>2. He is the Supream Judg.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. He is the wronged Party, against whom the
Offence is committed. Psal. 51. 4. <hi>Against thee,
against thee only have I sinned.</hi> He had sinned against
<hi>Bathsheba,</hi> against <hi>Vriah,</hi> whose Death he proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
How is it said, <hi>against thee only?</hi> There
may be wrong and hurt done to a Creature, but
the Sin is against God, as 'tis a breach of his Law,
and a despising of his Sovereign Authority; the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:47528:203"/>
Injury done to the Creature is nothing in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the Offence done to God, against so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Obligations wherein we stand bound to him.
Amongst Men, we distinguish between the Crime
and the Wrong. And a Criminal Action is one
thing, and an Action of Wrong and Trespass is
another. If a Man steal from another, 'tis not
enough to make him Restitution, but he must sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
the Law.</p>
               <p>2. He is the Supream Judg. Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, as one God, are the Judg of all the
Earth, to whom they must be accountable for the
Offence. Gen. 18. 25. <hi>Shall not the Iudg of all the
Earth do right?</hi> But in the Mystery of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Father, as first in order of the Persons,
is represented as the Judg, to whom the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is tendred, and who doth Authoritatively
pass a Sentence of Absolution. And therefore
'tis said, 1 Joh. 2. 1. <hi>We have an Advocate with the
Father, Iesus Christ the Righteous:</hi> He is to deal
with him as the Supream Judg; and <hi>'Tis God that
justifieth,</hi> Rom. 8. 33. The whole Business of our
Acquitment is carried on by the Father, who is to
receive the Satisfaction, and our humble Addresses
for Pardon.</p>
               <p>But to answer some Objections that may arise.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>'Tis said, Mat.</hi> 9. 6. The Son of Man
hath power on Earth to forgive Sins.</p>
               <p>I answer; That is brought there, as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his God-Head. He that was the Son of
Man, was also very God: And therefore, upon
Earth in the time of his Humiliation, he had
power to forgive Sins: for he ceased not to be
God when Incarnate; And it became him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
himself, as by his Divine Power in the work
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:47528:203"/>
of Miracles; so his Divine Authority in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of Sins.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>Is taken from the Text,</hi> Forgive us
our Debts, as we forgive those that trespass against us.</p>
               <p>I answer: In Sin, there is the Obliquity or
Fault in it, and the Hurt or Detriment that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds
to Man by it. As it is a Breach of the
Law of God, or an Offence to his Infinite Majesty,
God can only pardon it, or dispense with it: As it
is an hurt to us, so restitution is to be made to
Man, and Man can pardon or forgive it.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. <hi>'Tis said, Joh.</hi> 20. 23. Whosesoever Sins
ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever
Sins ye retain, they are retained. <hi>So that it seemeth
Man hath a power to remit Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer; They do it Declaratively, and by
Commission from God. The Officers of the
Church have the Keys of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
committed to them; the Key of Knowledg
or Doctrine, and the Key of Order and Discipline.
Accordingly this Power is called, <hi>The Keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 16. 19. And the use of
them is to open or shut the Doors of God's House,
and <hi>to bind or loose,</hi> as the Expression is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.
18. That is, to pronounce Guilty and liable to
Judgment, or to absolve and set free declarative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and in God's Name; or, as it is litterally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the place alledged, <hi>To remit or retain.</hi>
The Key of Doctrine is exercised about all Sin as
Sin, were it never so secret and inward: and the
Key of Order and Discipline about Sin only as 'tis
Scandalous and Infectious. Now what they act
Ministerially according to their Commission, 'tis
ratified in Heaven; for it is a Declaration or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
of the Sentence already passed there. So
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:47528:204"/>
that a Declarative and Ministerial Power is given
to the Church; but the Authoritative Power of
forgiving Sins, that God hath reserved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
Man can remit doctrinally, and by way of
Judicial Procedure; but that is only by way of
Commission and Ministerial Deputation. Such as
are Penitent, and feel the Bonds of their Sins,
they do declaratively absolve and loose them, or
take off the Censure Judicially inflicted for their
scandalous Carriage. This Ministerial forgiving,
however Carnal Hearts may slight it, both in
Doctrine and Discipline, yet being according to
the Rules of the Word, is owned by God, and
the Penitent shall feel it to their Encouragement,
and the Obstinate to their Terror.</p>
               <p>2. As he pardoneth Sin in the Conscience; and
there God alone can forgive Sin, or speak Peace
to the Soul upon a double Account.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Because of his Authority.</item>
                  <item>2. Because of his Power.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. Because of his Authority. Conscience is
God's Deputy, and till God be pacified, Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is not pacified, upon sound and solid Terms.
Therefore 'tis said, where Conscience doth its Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
1 Joh. 3. 20, 21. <hi>If our Hearts condemn us,
God is greater than our Hearts, and knoweth all things;
if our Hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence
towards God.</hi> God is greater than our Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
His Authority is greater, for God is Supream,
whose Sentence is decisive: Now, tho Conscience
should not do its Office, 1 Cor. 4. 4. <hi>For I know
nothing by my self, yet am I not hereby justified: but
he that judgeth me, is the Lord.</hi> All depends upon
God's Testimony.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:47528:204"/>
2. Because of his Power, who only can still the
Conscience; Isa. 57. 19. <hi>I create the Fruit of the
Lips to be Peace, Peace:</hi> That is, the Lips of his
Ministers or Messengers, who bring the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of Peace, or the reconcilement of God to his
People. And therefore 'tis called <hi>the Peace of
God,</hi> Phil. 4. 7. as wrought by him. The Gospel
is a sovereign Plaister, but 'tis God's Hand that
must make it stick upon the Soul, otherwise we
hear Words and return Words; 'tis by the lively
Operation of his Spirit that our Hearts are setled.
God cometh in with a sovereign powerful Act
upon the Soul. Otherwise one Grief or sad
Thought doth but awaken another: Till he
<hi>command Loving Kindness, Psal.</hi> 42. 8. We are still
followed with Temptations. As the Rain swells
the Rivers, and Rivers the Sea, and in the Sea
one Wave impelleth another; so doth one
Temptation raise another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. It reproveth those that do not deal
with God, about the Pardon of their Sins. If
God alone pardon Sins, then God must be sought
to about it. For tho there be none in Earth to
call us to an Account, yet God may call us to an
Account; and then what shall we do? Many, if
they escape the Judgment of Man, think they are
safe: But Alas! your Iniquities will find you out.
You think they are past, and never more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred;
but they will find you out in this
World, or the next: our Business lieth not with
Man so much as with God. Therefore this should
be the question of your Souls, Job 31. 14. <hi>What
then shall I do, when God riseth up? and when he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siteth,
what shall I answer him?</hi> Which way shall I
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:47528:205"/>
turn my self, when God calleth me to an Account?
He will come and enquire into our ways; are you
provided of an Answer? <hi>David's</hi> Sin was secret;
his Plot for the Destruction of <hi>Vriah</hi> closely carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<hi>Nathan</hi> tells him, 2 Sam. 12. 12. <hi>Thou didst
it secretly.</hi>—But, <hi>against thee have I sinned.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
escape blame with Men, but God's Wrath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Inquisition for Sinners. You cannot escape
his Search and Vengeance, if you do not treat with
him about a Pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. It shews the Folly of those that have
nothing to shew for the pardon of their Sins, but
their own secure Presumptions; 'Tis God's Act
to pardon Sin. Man may forget his Sin; But
if God remember it, he is miserable: Man may hide
his Sin, but if God bring it to Light; Man may
put off the Thoughts, but if God doth not put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
Man may excuse his Sin, but if God aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
it; the Debtor may deny the Debt, but if the
Book be not crossed, he is responsible. Psal. 32. 1, 2.
<hi>Blessed is he whose Transgression is forgiven, whose Sin
is covered; Blessed is the Man to whom the Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth
not Iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. We must have God's Act
to shew for our Discharge; then we may triumph,
<hi>'Tis God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth?</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. God is the offended Party,
and the Supream Judg. Then Conscience hath
nothing to do with us, nor Satan, neither as Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser,
or Executioner. Not as an Accuser, for
then he is but a Slanderer; not as an Executioner,
for he is turned out of Office; Heb. 2. 14. <hi>That
he might destroy him that had the power of Death, even
the Devil.</hi> Have you your Pardon from God? Is
your Discharge from him? When have it we
from God?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:47528:205"/>
1. Have it you from his Mouth, in the Word,
or Prayer, upon suing to him in Christ's Name,
and earnest waiting upon him? If Men would
consider how they come by their Peace, they
would sooner be undeceived. You were praying
and wrestling with God, and so your Comfort
came. God speaketh Peace. But when it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon you, you know not how; it was a thing
you never laboured for; like <hi>Ionah's</hi> Gourd, it
grew up in a Night; 'tis but a fond Dream.</p>
               <p>2. Have it you under his Hand? Is it a Peace
upon Scripture terms? of Faith? Rom. 5. 1.
<hi>Therefore being justified by Faith, we have Peace with
God through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Repentance,
Luke 24. 47. <hi>That Repentance and Remission of Sins
should be preached in his Name among all Nations,</hi> &amp;c.
And the Exercise of Holiness: Then have you
God's word to shew for it. But if it be not a
Peace consistent with Scripture-Rules; nay you
are afraid of the Word, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 20. You are loth
to be tried, 'tis a naughty Heart.</p>
               <p>3. Have it you under his Seal? 2 Cor. 1. 22.
<hi>Who hath also sealed us, and given us the earnest of the
Spirit in our Hearts:</hi> Have you the Impress of God
upon you, God's Seal, his Image? Doth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Promise assure your Hearts before God, that
you can live in the Strength of this Comfort, and
go about Duties chearfully? Then 'tis God's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
otherwise 'tis but your own Absolution
which is worth nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. It sheweth that we need not fear the
Censures of Men, nor the Hatred of the Ungodly;
for 'tis God pardoneth, and who can condemn?
God will not ask their Vote and Suffrage who shall
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:47528:206"/>
be accepted to Life, and who not, 1 Cor. 4. 3.
<hi>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be
judged of you, or of Mans Iudgment,</hi> &amp;c. A Man must
expect Censure that will be faithful to God; but
if he acquit us, it is no matter what our guilty Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Creatures
say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Is Comfort to broken-hearted Sinners;
to those that need and desire Pardon. 'Tis well
for them that God doth not put them off to others,
but reserveth this power of pardoning Sins to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>1. 'Tis his Glory to forgive Sins. Exod. 33. 18.
<hi>And he said, I beseech thee shew me thy Glory;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with Exod. 34. 6, 7. <hi>And the Lord passed by
before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God,
merciful, and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant
in Goodness and Truth. Keeping Mercy for thousands,
forgiving Iniquity, Transgression, and Sin,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis
not only the Glory of a Man, who is so offensive
himself, and so passionate, that this Passion will
draw him to what is unseemly, but of God.</p>
               <p>2. 'Tis his Glory not only above the Creatures,
but above all that is called God in the World.
Mic. 7. 18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth
Iniquity, and passeth by the Transgression of the Remnant
of his Heritage? He retaineth not his Anger for ever,
because he delighteth in Mercy.</hi> The Heathen Gods
were known by their Terrors rather than their
Benefits, and feared rather for their Revenges
than their Mercies. We may boast of him above
all Idol Gods upon this Account: He is known
among his People, not so much by acts of Power, as
acts of Grace, and the greatness of his Mercy, in
pardoning Sins for Christ's sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:47528:206"/>
3. He is willing to dispence a Pardon; Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 7.
18. <hi>He delighteth in Mercy.</hi> God delighteth in
himself, and all his Attributes, and the Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them in the World; but above all <hi>in his
Mercy.</hi> Justice is <hi>his strange act, Isa.</hi> 28. 21.
There is not any thing more pleasing to him.
'Tis the Mercy of God that he hath drawn up a
Petition for us; he would never have taught us to
have asked Mercy by Prayer, if he had not been
willing to shew us Mercy.</p>
               <p>4. God will do it for his own sake, and not
for any forreign Reasons. Isa. 43. 25. <hi>I, even I,
am he that blotteth out thy Transgressions for mine own
sake,</hi> and out of a respect to his own Honour.
See how God casts up his Accounts. It is Mercy,
Jer. 3. 12. <hi>I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will
not keep Anger for ever.</hi> So his Truth, Psal. 106. 45.
<hi>He remembred for them his Covenant, and repented
according to the Multitude of his Mercies.</hi> Not
from any desert of theirs, who do so neglect him,
and wrong him; God will do it upon his own
Reasons.</p>
               <p>5. He will do it in such a way as Man doth
not; in a way of infinite Mercy. Hos. 11. 9.
<hi>I will not execute the fierceness of mine Anger, for I
am God, and not Man.</hi> 'Tis the great Advantage
of us Sinners, that we have to do with God, and
not Man, in our Miscarriages: For Man's Pity
and Mercy may be exhausted be it never so great.
What, seven times a Day? But God is Infinite.
Man may think it dishonourable to agree with an
Inferior when he stoops not to him; but God is
so far above the Creature, that we are below his
Indignation. Man is soon wearied, but not God.
Isa. 55. 8, 9. <hi>For my Thoughts are not your Thoughts,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:47528:207"/>
neither are your Ways my Ways, saith the Lord. For
as the Heavens are higher than the Earth; so are my
Ways higher than your Ways, and my Thoughts than
your Thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I now come to the fourth and last Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>IV. That Forgiveness of Sins is one great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
that we must ask of God in Prayer. Here
it will be needful to shew,</p>
               <p>First, The Necessity of treating with God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Nature of this Benefit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Terms how God dispenseth it.</p>
               <p>First; The Necessity will appear in these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Man hath a Conscience, Rom. 2. 15. <hi>Thoughts
accusing or excusing,</hi> &amp;c. A Beast cannot reflect.</item>
                  <item>2. A Conscience inferreth a Law.</item>
                  <item>3. A Law inferreth a Sanction.</item>
                  <item>4. A Sanction inferreth a Judgment.</item>
                  <item>5. A Judgment—a Condemnation to the
fall'n Creature.</item>
                  <item>6. There is no avoiding this Condemnation,
unless God set up a Chancery, or another Court of
Grace.</item>
                  <item>7. If God set up another Court, our Plea must
be Grace. <hi>Of this see more at large</hi> 20. Serm. 1 Serm.
<hi>on</hi> Psal. 32. 1, 2.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Secondly; The Nature of this Benefit, or
manner how God forgiveth.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:47528:207"/>
                  <item>1. Freely.</item>
                  <item>2. Fully.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. Freely, and meerly upon the Impulsions of
his own Grace. Isa. 43. 25. <hi>I, even I am he that
forgiveth your Iniquities for my Name sake.</hi> Nothing
else could move him to it, but his own Mercy;
and he could have chosen whether he would have
done so yea or no: For <hi>he spared not the Angels;</hi>
but offereth Pardon to Man, and all Men are not
actually pardoned. And therefore, the only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why he sheweth us Mercy and not others, is
meerly his own Grace. The Intervention of
Christ's Merit doth not hinder the Freedom of it;
Tho dearly purchased by Christ, yet freely bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on us. For 'tis said, Rom. 3. 24. <hi>Iustified freely
by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Christ.</hi>
Why? partly because it was Mercy that he would
not prosecute his Right against us. Partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he found out the way how to recompense
the wrong done by Sin unto his Majesty, and out
of his Love, sent his Son to make this Recompence
for us. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. 'Twas Love set all a-work.
And lastly, not excited hereunto by any worth on
our parts, but the external moving cause was only
our Misery, and the internal moving cause his
own Grace. Nor is the Freedom of this Act in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed
by requiring Faith and Repentance on our
part: because that only sheweth the way and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
wherein this Grace is dispensed, not the cause
why. 'Tis not for the worth of our Repentance,
or as if there were any Merit in it. A Malefactor
that beggeth his Pardon on his Knees, doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a Pardon; only the Majesty of the Prince
requireth that it should be submissively asked.
These are not Conditions of Merit, but Order;
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:47528:208"/>
not the Cause, but the way of Grace's working:
And these Conditions are wrought in us by
Grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. not required only, but given.
In all other Covenants, the Party contracting, is
bound to perform what he promiseth by his own
strength: But in the Covenant of Grace, God
doth not only require that we should Believe and
Repent, but causeth it in us. Conditions of the
Covenant, are Conditions in the Covenant. God
requireth Faith and Repentance, and giveth Faith
and Repentance; compare <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 20. with <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 26. 'Tis Christ's Gift as well as his Precept.
So that when we come about pardon of Sin, we
have only to do with Grace: We beg Pardon,
and a Heart to receive it. <hi>'Tis a Free Pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. 'Tis a Full Pardon. 'Tis Full in several
respects. 1. Because, where the Party is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
he is accepted with God as if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sinned; Psal. 103. 12. <hi>As far as the East is
from the VVest; so far hath he removed our Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
from us.</hi> And <hi>Mich. 7. 19. Thou wilt cast
all their Sins into the depth of the Sea.</hi> Isa. 38. 17.
<hi>Thou hast cast all my Sins behind thy Back.</hi> It shall
not be remembred, nor laid to their charge any
more. 'Tis true, for a while after they may
trouble the Conscience; as when the Storm ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
the Waves rowl for a while afterwards: So
may Sin in the Consciences of God's Children
work trouble, after the fiducial Application of
the Blood of Christ; But the Storm ceaseth by
degrees. And 'tis possible, that the commitment
of new Sins, may revive old Guilt, as a new
Strain may make us sensible of an old Bruise. Yet
we must distinguish between the full Grant of a
Pardon: From the full sense of it, when we are
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:47528:208"/>
not Thankful, Humble, Fruitful, former Sins
may come into remembrance; and God may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it, as matter of Humiliation to us, and to
quicken us to seek after new Confirmation of our
Right and Interest. Yet God's Pardon is never
reversed, nor will the Sin be charged again, or
put in suit against him, to the final condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Person so pardoned. Once more,
though the Sins of the Justified should be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
at the Day of Judgment, it will not be to
the confusion of their Faces, but the exaltation
and praise of the Lord's Grace. Then is this
Acquittance in all respects full. 2. 'Tis full, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
where God forgiveth one Sin, he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
all: Psal. 103. 3. <hi>Who pardoneth all thy Sins:</hi>
And <hi>Mich. 7. 19. Thou wilt cast all their Sins into
the depth of the Sea;</hi> Sins Original, Actual; of
Omission, Commission; Small, Great, Secret,
Open; Lust that boileth in the Heart, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out in the Life; Sins of Worship, of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Conversation. Look in the Bill; What
owest thou? A Christian is amazed when he
cometh to a serious account with God; but the
self-judging Sinner needeth not be discouraged
when he cometh to God. For where God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth
all that is past, the Fountain stands daily
open for him to flee unto, with all his Faults, as
they are committed; and upon the renewing of
his Faith and Repentance, he shall obtain his
Pardon. All Sins are Mortal, all of them Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
Therefore if all Sins be not pardoned, he
remaineth in danger of the Curse; and one Sin
let alone, is sufficient to exclude us out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Therefore all is pardoned, first or last, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
hath no more to seek of Christ: And we
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:47528:209"/>
have all leave to sue out our Pardon in Christ's
Name; He is under that Covenant that will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
all.</p>
               <p>3. 'Tis Full; Because, where God forgiveth
the Sin, he also forgiveth the Punishment. 'Twill
not stand with God's Mercy, to forgive the
Debt, and yet to require the Paiment. 'Tis a
mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>king to say, I forgive you the Debt, and
yet cast the Man into Prison; and to pardon the
Malefactor, and yet leave him liable to Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Here, in the Text, God <hi>forgiveth us, as
we are bound to forgive our Brother;</hi> not in part,
but in whole. Guilt is nothing but an Obligation
to Punishment. 1. As to Eternal Punishment, 'tis
clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. The Eternal Promises and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
being of Things absolutely Good and Evil,
are therefore absolute and peremptory, that is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
2. But now, as to Temporal Afflictions, there
is some difficulty; for where the whole Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is done away, such Grace, and payment of
any part of the Debt, cannot stand together.
That Pardon which is given upon valuable and
sufficient Price, is full and perfect. Jesus Christ
satisfied the Justice of God for all our Sins. How
is it then that the Saints are subject to so many
Afflictions? 1. So far as Sin remains, so far
some penal Evil remains; when the Dominion
of it is broken, there remains no Condemnation,
but yet some Affliction; and when 'tis wholly
gone, there is no Evil at all. We are not yet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from all Sin. And therefore, 2. These Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
are not satisfactory Punishments, and
need not, as to the compleating of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but are helps to us, as the furtherance of
our Sanctification. And so are of great use,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:47528:209"/>
1. To make us hate Sin more. If we only knew
the sweetness of it, and not the bitterness, we
would not be so shy of it. Now the bitterness
of it is seen by the effects; <hi>Ier. 2. 19. Thine own
wickedness shall correct thee, and thy back-slidings
shall reprove thee; Know therefore, and see, that it
is an evil thing, and bitter; that thou hast forsaken
the Lord thy God, and that my Fear is not in thee,
saith the Lord God of Hosts.</hi> 2. 'Twill cause us
to prize our deliverance by Christ. If Affliction
be so grievous, what would Hell be? 1 Cor. 11.
32. <hi>But when we are judged, we are chastned of the
Lord, that we should not be condemned with the
World.</hi> 'Tis a gentle remembrance of Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pains,
or a fair warning to avoid them, when
scorched or sindged a little. 3. To make us walk
more humbly. We forget our selves, and are apt
to be puffed up. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 7. Lest I
should be exalted above measure, through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the Revelations, there was given to me a
Thorn in the Flesh, the Messenger of Satan to buffet
me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. 'Tis Full; Because, where God forgiveth
Sin, there are many consequent Benefits.</p>
               <p>(1.) God is reconciled. <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Therefore
being justified by Faith, we have peace with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> This is the great
Blessing, and our great Work is, to make and
keep peace with God; to have no Cloud between
us and his Face. Light is pleasant; What then
is the Light of his Countenance, that filleth us
with a Peace that passes understanding? We
would have a powerful Friend, especially if we
need him. Acts 12. 20. <hi>They sought Peace with</hi>
Herod, <hi>because their Country was nourished by the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:47528:210"/>
King's Country;</hi> so should we do, we cannot live
without God. If Sin be pardoned, then we are
at peace with God, and may have free access to
him, with a free use of all that is his.</p>
               <p>(2.) A Heart sanctified, is a connexed Benefit;
1 Cor. 6. 11. <hi>And such were some of you, but ye
are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the Name of the Lord Iesus.</hi> And 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.
9. Sin is considerable in the guilt and filth of it;
as it rendreth us obnoxious to God's Justice; or
as it tainteth our Faculties and Actions: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this double respect, Christ destroyeth Sin,
and no Man hath benefit by him, that is not freed
from the guilt and filth thereof. Christ was sent
into the World to restore God's Image in us:
But the Image of God, consisteth in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of Holiness, as well as the participation
of Blessedness; for God, that is Happy and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
is also Holy and Good; the filthiness of Sin
is opposite to Holiness, and the guilt of it to
blessedness: So that either Christ must restore
but half the Image of God, or he must give us
this double Benefit; if he should give us one
without the other, many Inconveniences would
follow. Therefore both are given; he justifieth
that he may sanctify, and he sanctifieth that he
may glorify.</p>
               <p>(3.) <hi>Providence is blessed. The Curse is taken
out of our Blessings, and the Sting out of our
Afflictions. As long as Sin remains unpardoned,
our Blessings are cursed; Mal.</hi> 2. 2. If ye will
not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart to give
glory to my Name, saith the Lord of Hosts, I will
even send a Curse upon you, and I will curse your
Blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:47528:210"/>
ye do not lay it to heart: <hi>There will be a Worm in
our Manna,</hi> our Table will become a Snare, <hi>Psal. 69.
22. But when once Sin is pardoned, the Sting
of Misery is taken away: 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 56. The
Sting of Death is Sin, and the strength of Sin is
the Law: But thanks be to God, which giveth us the
victory, through our Lord Iesus Christ. <hi>Crosses are
not Curses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(4.) <hi>We have a right to Heaven, which is the
great ground of Hope; Rom.</hi> 5. 10. For if when
we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
Death of his Son; much more being reconciled, we
shall be saved by his Life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; The Terms upon which 'tis dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
are Faith and Repentance.</p>
               <p>1. Faith. Acts 10. 43. <hi>To him give all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
witness, that through his Name whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
in him, shall receive remission of Sins.</hi> Faith
is necessary to honour the Mercy of God, to
own the Surety, to consent to his Undertaking,
to encourage the Creature to look after this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
               <p>2. Repentance. Which implieth a sorrow for
Sin, with a serious purpose of forsaking it.
Sorrow for Sin; no Man can seriously desire a
Pardon, but he that is touched with a sense of
his Sin, moved and troubled at it. And then,
for purpose of forsaking; Ezek. 33. 12. <hi>As for
the wickedness of the Wicked, he shall not fall thereby
in the day that he turneth from his Wickedness.</hi> Sin
pardoned, must be left; otherwise, a Pardon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to a wicked Man, would be a confirmation of
his Sin, or a concession of leave to sin. Well then,
let us seek Pardon of God in this way.</p>

               </list>
               <p>The first part doth more concern <hi>preventing</hi>
Grace, that we may not fall into Evil: and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<hi>recovering</hi> Grace, that if we fall into Evil, we
may not be overcome of it, nor overwhelmed by
it, but may find deliverance from the Lord.
Here we pray, (1.) that we <hi>may</hi> not be <hi>tempted.</hi>
Or (2.) if the Lord see it fit we should be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that we may not <hi>yield.</hi> Or (3.) if we

the former Petition concerned the <hi>guilt</hi> of Sin,

               <p>In this first Part, take notice;</p>

<hi>Lead us not;</hi> we do acknowledg he hath
the disposal of Temptation.</item>
                     <item>2. God's <hi>Iustice,</hi> and our <hi>Desert;</hi> that for
former Sins, God may suffer this Evil to
befal us. We have so often provoked
the Lord, that in a judicial manner he
may suffer us to be tempted.</item>
                     <item>3. Our <hi>weakness;</hi> that we are unable to stand
under such a condition by our own

               </p>
               <p>2. Something formally asked; that is, either
that God would prevent the Temptation:
or if he should use such a Dispensation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, give us Grace to overcome it.</p>
               <p>Of these things I shall speak in their Order.</p>
               <p>First; Of the Evil <hi>deprecated;</hi> and from
thence observe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That Temptations are a usual Evil,
wherewith we encounter in the present World.</p>
               <p>Here I shall,
<list>
                     <item>I. Open the Nature of Temptations.</item>
                     <item>II. I shall give you some Observations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them.</item>
                     <item>III. The Reasons of it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I. For the <hi>Nature</hi> of Temptations.</p>
               <p>Temptation, is a proving or making tryal of
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:47528:212"/>
a Thing, or Person, what he is, and what he
will do. And thus sometimes we are said to
tempt God, and at other times God is said to
tempt us.</p>
               <p>1. We are said to <hi>tempt God,</hi> when we put it
to the proof, whether he will be as good as his
word, either in the Cominatory or Promissory
part thereof; <hi>Psalm 95. 9. When your Fathers
tempted me, proved me, and saw my Works:</hi> they
tempted God, as they put him often upon the
trial. To note that (by the way) there's a
two-fold tempting or proving of God; either in
a way of Duty, or Sin. In a way of <hi>Duty,</hi> when
we wait to see his Promise fulfill'd: And so,
<hi>Mal. 3. 10. Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord
of Hosts, I will not open you the Windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and pour you out a Blessing;</hi> come pay your
Tithes and Offerings: He would have the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which belonged to himself; <hi>and prove me
now herewith,</hi> &amp;c. God submits to a Trial from
Experience, when we wait for the Good promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Thus we try God, and try his <hi>Word.</hi> Psal.
18. 30. <hi>The Word of the Lord is a tried Word: He
is a Buckler to all those that trust in him.</hi> All those
which build upon it, that wait to see what God
will do, they will find it, upon experience, to be
accomplished to a tittle: Never did any build
upon it, or wait for the accomplishment of it in
vain. 2. In a way of <hi>Sin.</hi> Many ways we are
said to tempt God: When we set God a task, in
satisfying our Conceits, and Carnal Affections;
Psal. 78. 18. <hi>They tempted God in their Hearts, by
asking Meat for their Lusts:</hi> And when we will
not believe in him, but upon Conditions of our
own making: or when we consine him to our
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:47528:212"/>
Means, or Time, or manner of working: or
would have some extraordinary proof of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Power, and Goodness: or see whether
God will punish us though we sin against him.
All these ways we are said to tempt God in a
way of Sin. But that's not my business now.
Therefore,</p>
               <p>2. As Man tempts God, so is <hi>Man</hi> himself
<hi>tempted.</hi> Now Man is either tempted,
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>First,</hi> By God.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> By Satan.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By his own Heart.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Man is tempted by <hi>God.</hi> Gen. 22. 1.
<hi>And it came to pass, after these things, that God
did tempt</hi> Abraham. How is God said to tempt
Man? When he trieth what is in us; Deut. 8. 2.
<hi>To humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in
thine Heart:</hi> either what of Grace, or what of
Sin, is in our Heart.</p>
               <p>(1.) What of <hi>Grace.</hi> Thus the Lord tries us
by Afflictions, by delays of Promises, and other
means becoming his Holy Nature. By <hi>Afflictions,</hi>
for they are called a Trial, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 6. Now for
a Season, (if need be) ye are in heaviness through
manifold Temptations.</hi> The Afflictions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
are called <hi>Temptations.</hi> And so, by <hi>delay</hi> of
<hi>Promises;</hi> God trieth us, sometimes by delaying
the accomplishment of his Promise; as in <hi>Psalm
105. 19. Vntil the Time that his Word came, the
Word of the Lord tried him;</hi> that is, until the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
was fulfilled and accomplished. A Man is
put to trial of all the Grace that is in his Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:47528:213"/>
(2.) God tries what <hi>Corruption</hi> there is in us:
He trieth this, either by offering Occasions, or
withdrawing his Grace; or by permitting Satan
to tempt us.</p>
               <p>1. By offering <hi>Occasions</hi> in the course of his
Providence; God puts us upon trial there, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by want, sometimes by fulness. By <hi>Want.</hi>
John 6. 5, 6. <hi>Whence shall we buy Bread that these
may eat? saith Christ to</hi> Philip. <hi>And this he said
to prove him; for he himself knew what he would
do.</hi> Christ will have the <hi>weakness</hi> of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
tried, as well as their <hi>strength.</hi> And he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his People often by this kind of trial, when
there are many Mouths, and no Meat; and a
Man cannot see which way his visible Supplies
shall come in, this he doth to prove them, to see
whether they will look only to outward likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and probabilities, or rest themselves upon
God's Promise and Alsufficiency: or else by <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and outward <hi>Prosperity,</hi> to see if they will
forget him. I confess, I do not remember where
this is called a <hi>trial</hi> in Scripture, unless there be
somewhat in that place, <hi>Deut. 8. 16. He fed thee
with Manna in the Wilderness, that he might humble
thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good
at thy latter End.</hi> Possibly the trial there might
lie in this, because they had but from hand to
mouth; or, because it was not that Meat which
their Lusts craved, but that which God saw fit
for them. But however, though Prosperity be not
called so, yet certainly it is in it self a trial. <hi>Prov.
30. 9. Give me not Riches, lest I be full, and deny
thee, and say, Who is the Lord?</hi> Lust in us
makes it to be a Temptation; and the Godly
have been often foiled by it; and they need learn
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:47528:213"/>
                  <hi>how to abound, as well as how to be abased,</hi> Phil. 4.
12. They need learn how to avoid the Snares
of a prosperous Condition. <hi>David,</hi> it was a
trial to him; while he was wandring in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
he had such tenderness, that his Heart
smote him, when he cut off the Lap of <hi>Saul</hi>'s
Garment; while he was chased like a Partridg
upon the Mountains, wandring up and down,
from Forrest to Forrest: But when he was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at ease, upon the Tarras of his Pallace in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
then he falls into Blood and Uncleanness;
And therefore his Estate was a trial, and he lieth
in it, notwithstanding all his former tenderness
of Heart, until he was roused up by <hi>Nathan</hi> the
Prophet. And certainly, as to the <hi>Wicked,</hi> it is
a very great Temptation, judicially inflicted,
disposed of to them by God's Judgment, they
are plagued by worldly Felicity; and it is part
of their Curse, <hi>that they shall be written in the
Earth,</hi> Jer. 17. 13. And suitable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
God saith, <hi>Ier. 6. 21. Behold, I will lay
stumbling-blocks before this People, and the Fathers,
and the Sons, together shall fall upon them.</hi> How
doth God lay stumbling-blocks? If Men will
find the Sin, God may with justice enough find
the Occasion; he will give them some outward
Condition that is a Snare to them. As we may
try a Servant whom we have just cause to suspect,
by laying something in the way, that his filching
Humor may be discovered, without any breach
of Justice; so the Wicked, that harden their
Hearts against God, God may give them their
Hearts desire, and worldly Happiness, and so it
may cause them to stumble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:47528:214"/>
2. God trieth us also, by withdrawing his
<hi>Grace,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Chron. 32. 31. God left him to try
him, that he might know all that was in his Heart.</hi>
It is needful sometimes that we should see our
Weakness as well as our Strength, and how una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
we are to stand without Grace, that we may
be sensible whence we stand, and which without
Temptation could not so well be.</p>
               <p>3. God trys us, by <hi>permitting</hi> the <hi>Temptations</hi>
of <hi>Satan,</hi> and his Instruments; for surely these
Things do not befal us without a Providence.
Job 12. 16. <hi>The Deceived, and the Deceiver, are
his,</hi> his Creatures; and nothing can be done or
suffered in this kind, without God's Providence.
See it in Christ's Instance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 1. It is said,
He <hi>was led up of the Spirit into the Wilderness, to be
tempted of the Devil;</hi> that is, led by the Good
and Holy Spirit, to be tempted by the Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
So, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 1. compared with 1 <hi>Chron.
21. 1. God moved</hi> David, <hi>and Satan provoked</hi>
David <hi>to number the People;</hi> that is, God did let
loose Satan upon <hi>David,</hi> to accomplish the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Ends of his Providence. And many of
those Arrows which are shot at us, though they
come immediatly from Satan's Bow, yet they
are taken out of God's Quiver. God, as a just
Judg, may give us up to Satan, as his Minister
and Executioner. Well then, this is one way of
God's tempting, permitting of Satan to tempt.
And as Satan, so his <hi>Instruments,</hi> God trys us by
them. Deut. 13. 1, 2, 3. <hi>If there arise among you
a Prophet, or a Dreamer of Dreams, thou shalt not
hearken unto him.</hi> Why? <hi>For the Lord your God
proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your
God with all your Heart, and with all your Soul.</hi>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:47528:214"/>
God proveth. When there are delusions abroad, and
Errors broached, it is, <hi>that the approved may be
made manifest,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 19. God letteth loose
these Winds of Error and Delusion, that the solid
Grain may be distinguished from the light Chaff:
And that he may discover his own People, and
whether we have received Truths upon Evidence,
or taken them up only upon Hearsay. All these
ways may God be said to tempt.</p>
               <p>Now concerning this, take these Rules.</p>
               <p>1. God's tempting is not to inform himself,
but to discover his Creatures to themselves and
others. Not to <hi>inform himself,</hi> for <hi>he knows our
Thoughts afar off,</hi> Psal. 139. 2. that is, he knows
not only the Conclusion and Event, and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of things near; but he knows the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
preparation aforehand: he knows what
kind of Thoughts we will have, and workings of
Spirit. As a Man that is up in the Air, may see a
River in its Rise and Fountain, and Course, and
Fall of it, seeth it all at once; whereas another
which stands by the Banks, can only see the Water
as it passeth by. God seeth all things in their
Fountain and Cause, as well as in their Issue and
Event, he seeth all things together; therefore it's
not for his own Information. But the meaning is,
therefore doth God try us, that what is known
to him, and yet unknown to our selves, that that
which lodgeth and lyeth hid in our Heart, may be
discovered to us. That we may not be conceited
of more than we have, and that the evil which
before lay hid and was unseen, may be cured when
it is discovered. And (on the other side) that
Grace may not lye sleeping in a dead and unactive
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:47528:215"/>
Habit, but be drawn out into act and view, for
his Glory and Praise.</p>
               <p>2. God's tempting is always good, and for
good; his tempting is either in Mercy or in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
In <hi>Mercy;</hi> and so, when he tryeth the
Graces of his People; or when he means more
especially to discover the failings of his People, it
is all Good. When he tries the <hi>Graces</hi> of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
there is no doubt of that. When God hath
furnished a Man with Grace, that he may (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Impeachment of his Goodness) put him
upon Trial, and use Creatures for that end for
which he hath fitted them; as a Man which hath
made and bought a thing, may prove it, and try
the strength of it. Or when the intent of the
Dispensation is to try their <hi>Weakness,</hi> that's good
also, and for good; as when a Man tries a leaky-Vessel,
with an intent to make it stanch. So
when God tempts us by sharp Afflictions, or any
other Course, it's for good; Heb. 12. 10. <hi>He,
verily, for our profit, that we might be partakers of his
Holiness.</hi> A Man that hath a Disease upon him,
it may be walking or stirring the Humours
the Disease may appear, it is for good; 'tis better
it should be discovered, that he may in time look
after a Remedy, than lurk and lye hid in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to his utter undoing: So it is for good our
Corruptions and Weaknesses should be discovered,
that they may be made sound. Ay but when God
brings' it in Judgment, yet that's for good, that is,
for his own Glory and his Churches good, tho not
for the good of the Party. For the <hi>Churches</hi> good,
that naughtiness where it is might in time be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
Prov. 26. 26. <hi>Whose Hatred is covered by
Deceit, his Wickedness shall be shewed before the whole
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:47528:215"/>
Congregation;</hi> lest Men get a Name that they
might do Religion a Mischief: And it is for the
<hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that Men may appear what they are.
Here's no stain upon God's <hi>Iustice</hi> for all this.
He that pierceth a Vessel, if it run dreggy with
musty or poisonous Liquor, the fault is not in him
that pierceth it, but in the Liquor it self; he that
pierceth or broacheth it, doth only discover what
is within, that if it be unsavory he may cast it
into the Kennel: So, it is not the fault of God
which pierceth, discovereth, and letteth out our
Corruption, the fault is in our selves; we have
those things within, which are discovered as soon
as God puts us upon a trial.</p>
               <p>3. God tempts no Man, as Temptation is taken
properly for a sollicitation to Sin; Jam. 1. 13.
<hi>Let no Man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of
God: for God cannot be tempted with Evil, neither
tempteth he any Man.</hi> Mark, the Apostle proves
it, that in this sence God cannot tempt, because of
the unchangeable Holiness of his Nature. In
Temptation we must distinguish between the meer
trial, and the sollicitation to Sin; the meer trial
that's from God, but the sollicitation to Sin, that's
from Satan and our selves. God sollicites no Man
to Sin. It is true, God may try us, trouble us,
toss us, exercise our Faith, Hope, and Patience.
God is the Author of our <hi>Trouble;</hi> but the Devil
is the Author of our <hi>Sin,</hi> who sinneth himself, and
solliciteth others to Sin.</p>
               <p>4. When we say, <hi>Lead us not into Temptation,</hi>
we do not beg a total <hi>exemption</hi> from God's Trials,
but only a removal of the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of them: Not
a <hi>total exemption,</hi> for then we must go out of the
World, for while we are here, every Condition is
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:47528:216"/>
a trial to us, and every Enjoyment. Afflictions
and Trouble more or less put to trial, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Temptation in this sence is a necessary part
of that Warfare we must encounter and grapple
withal while we are in the World. <hi>Prosperity</hi>
tries us, to see if we be then mindful of God when
all things succeed well: And <hi>Adversity</hi> tries us,
to see if we can patiently depend upon God. But
it is the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of trials that we deprecate, that
they may not come upon us as a Judgment, or
that our trial may be so moderate that we may
stand our Ground. When doth a trial come as a
Judgment? When it is immoderate and beyond
our Strength, either in a way of Prosperity or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
but chiefly in a way of <hi>Adversity;</hi> for
that's most commonly set out in a way of trial in
Scripture. When it is immoderate and beyond
our Strength, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. God hath promised
to his People, that <hi>they shall not be tempted above
that they are able to bear; but will with the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
also make a way to escape, that they may be able to
bear it.</hi> God's Conduct is very gently. As <hi>Iacob</hi>
drove on as the little ones were able to bear: So
doth God proportion his Dispensations to his
People's Strength, not to their <hi>deservings,</hi> but he
considers what they are able to bear. Either God
keeps off greater Trials, or gives in greater
Strength; a sweeter sence of his Love, or a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
measure of gracious Support. A Child would
sink under that Load that a strong Back bears
without any grudging. Now this is that we ask
of God (according to his Promise) that our
Temptation may not be immoderate, and too
hard for us. Or else it is a Judgment, when it
proves a provocation to <hi>Sin;</hi> and so God's
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:47528:216"/>
Temptation which was meant for our good, we
may abuse it, and take occasion thence to Sin; as
when we murmur under the Cross, or turn our
worldly Comforts into an occasion to the Flesh.
Now to prevent the Judgment which may be in
these Temptations, in all the Trials which befal
us, we should fear more the Offence against God,
than our own Smart, or the power of the Devil,
or any Inconvenience that may accrue to us in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Evils which we feel. When we are under
Afflictions, we should be more sollicitous that we
do not <hi>offend</hi> God, that he would keep us from
murmuring and dishonouring his Name, then we
should be about our <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>safety;</hi> for this is to
prevent the Judgment of the Temptation. This
was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Comfort when he was drawing to the
Conclusion of his Life, 2 Tim. 4. 18. <hi>The Lord
hath delivered me out of the Mouth of the Lion, and
he shall deliver me from every evil work, and will
preserve me unto his heavenly Kingdom.</hi> And so, in
<hi>good</hi> things that we enjoy, we should fear more
<hi>offending</hi> God with them, than the <hi>losing</hi> of them;
for the loss of his <hi>Favour,</hi> is more than the loss of
our <hi>Comforts.</hi> A Man that loseth his worldly
Portion, this loss may be recompensed; but he
that loseth the Favour of God, that breach can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made up by any worldly Comforts whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>5. In Passive Evils (which are the usual Trials
of God's People) we are not to seek them, but to
submit to them when they come upon us. We
are not to seek them, Mat. 16. 24. <hi>If any Man will
be my Disciple, let him take up his Cross.</hi> When
clearly it is our Cross (that is) when it lies in
our way, and we cannot decline it, then take it
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:47528:217"/>
up and fit his Back to it. So Jam. 1. 2. <hi>My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
count it all Ioy when ye</hi> fall <hi>into divers Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
He doth not say when ye <hi>run</hi> into them,
but <hi>fall</hi> into them. We are not to draw them
upon our selves. Afflictions are not to be <hi>sought,</hi>
and <hi>desired,</hi> but <hi>improved.</hi> Christians, we never
know when 'tis well with us: sometimes we que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
God's Love, because we have <hi>no</hi> Afflictions
and Trials: anon we are questioning his Love,
because we have <hi>nothing</hi> but Afflictions. In all these
things we should <hi>refer</hi> our selves to God; not
desire Troubles, but bear them patiently and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
when he lays them upon our Backs.</p>
               <p>6. Again, For those Trials which come from
God. When God tempts us, or trieth his People
in Mercy, he hath a great deal of <hi>care</hi> of them <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
their Trials. As a Gold-Smith, when he casts
his Metal into the Furnace, he doth not lose it
there, and look after it no more; but sits, and
prys, and looks to see if it be not too hot, that
nothing be split, nothing lost. So it is said, Mal.
3. 3. <hi>And he shall sit as a Refiner and Purifier of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
and he shall purify the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>and purge
them as Gold and Silver, that they may offer unto the
Lord an Offering in Righteousness.</hi> The Lord will
observe his People when they are under Trial,
how to moderate Affliction, how to refresh them
with seasonable Comfort, that all this might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, and bring them to good.</p>
               <p>7. Tho in our Trials we manifest <hi>Weakness</hi> as
well as <hi>Grace,</hi> yet that weakness is to be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
You must remember Weakness is manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
that it may be removed, and Grace manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
that it may be strengthned. When Gold
and Silver is try'd in the Furnace, there is not
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:47528:217"/>
only pure Metal discovered, but also the drossy
part mingled with it; but it is so discovered, that
it may be severed from the Gold: Such is our
Trial, it may discover a great deal of Dross and
Sin in us. But this is our Comfort, that as it doth
<hi>discover</hi> Sin; so it conduceth to <hi>mortify</hi> Sin.
Therefore saith <hi>Iob,</hi> Chap. 23. 10. <hi>When he hath
tried me, I shall come forth as Gold;</hi> that is, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and refined, and having the drossy part eaten
out.</p>
               <p>8. God permits us to be tempted of Satan and
his Instruments for his Glory and our Good. For
his <hi>Glory;</hi> that his Power may be discovered in
our Preservation, in upholding that Grace he hath
put into us; 2 Cor. 12. 10. <hi>Therefore I take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in Infirmities, in Reproaches, in Necessities, in
Persecutions, in Distresses for Christ's sake: for when
I am weak, then am I strong:</hi> We should be glad
that God be glorified, tho with our great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.
And it is for our <hi>Good;</hi> to correct our
Pride, and Vain-Glory. When <hi>Peter</hi> presumed
of his Strength, then God left him to be tempted
of the Damsel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 33, 34, 35, 70.</p>
               <p>9. When God permitteth Satan to exercise us,
tho he suspends the Victory, yet if he give us
Grace to fight and to maintain the Combate, it is
a great Mercy. For so he dealt with <hi>Paul,</hi> when
he had to do with the Messenger of Satan, (Satan
was in that trouble, be it what it will) he had only
this Answer, 2 Cor. 12. 9. <hi>My Grace is sufficient
for thee: for my Strength is made perfect in Weakness.</hi>
Three times he had been with God, and then he
gets his answer, and it was only this, <hi>My Grace, &amp;c.</hi>
Jesus Christ in his Conflict and Combate, was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
as to <hi>Support,</hi> and so was heard in the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:47528:218"/>
Things he feared. So if God give Strength to
the Soul, it is an answer tho he do not take off the
Trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are Temptations from <hi>Satan,</hi> as
well as from <hi>God;</hi> who is called the <hi>Tempter, Mat.</hi>
4. 3. Now the Devil's Temptations they are
Evil, and for Evil. How doth the Devil tempt?</p>
               <p>1. By propounding <hi>Objects;</hi> As Luke 4. 5. <hi>He
shewed unto him all the Kingdoms of the World in a
moment of time.</hi> He had nothing to work upon
within, therefore he propounds outward Objects.
So still the Devil tempts us with a curious Eye to
take in the Object, that it may be a Bait and Snare
to the Soul. <hi>Achan</hi> takes notice of it himself,
Josh. 7. 21. <hi>When I saw among the Spoils a goodly
Babylonish Garment, and a Wedg of Gold, then I co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted
them, and took them. I saw, I coveted,</hi> and
<hi>I took:</hi> The Eye awakens Desire, and Desire that
inclines to Practise. So Prov. 23. 31. <hi>Look not
thou upon the Wine when it is red, when it giveth his
colour in the Cup, when it moveth it self aright.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we shut the Windows of the Soul, this pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Plague gets in by the Senses. The Heart is
corrupted by Objects that we take in by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as it corrupted <hi>Eve,</hi> dealt with her first by
the Sense; the forbidden Fruit was full in her way,
then the Devil sets upon her.</p>
               <p>2. He tempts by the persuasion of <hi>Instruments,</hi>
who are the Devil's Spokes-men: Thus was <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
tempted by the Inticements and Blandish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Mistress, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 7. And many times
the Devil sets nearest Friends and Relations to
weaken their Zeal, and withdraw their Hearts
from God. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 23. Saith Christ to <hi>Peter,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:47528:218"/>
Get thee behind me, Satan.</hi> It was <hi>Peter</hi> said it,
yet Christ rebuked <hi>Satan,</hi> for the Devil had a
hand in it; he makes one of Christ's Disciples
his Instrument.</p>
               <p>3. He doth it by <hi>internal suggestion,</hi> 1 Chron.
21. 1. <hi>And Satan stood up against Israel, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked</hi>
David <hi>to number Israel;</hi> that is, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
suggestion. John 13. 2. <hi>The Devil put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Heart of</hi> Judas <hi>to betray him.</hi> He haunts
and pesters the Hearts of Men, by vain Thoughts,
and carnal Imaginations. <hi>So the God of this
World is said to blind their Minds,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4.</p>
               <p>4. By stirring up the <hi>Humors</hi> of our <hi>Body.</hi>
When he seeth Men inclined to Wrath, and
angry Motions, or Lust, the Devil joins, and
makes the Tempest the more violent. He knows
what use to make of an angry Look, a wanton
Glance; he knows how to tempt, by awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Humors of our own Body against us.</p>
               <p>Take some Observations here.</p>
               <p>1. In all Sins Satan joineth, he is not idle, but
makes use of every <hi>Inclination</hi> of ours; as he sees
the Tree leaning, he joins issue. But some Sins are
purely of his suggestion; horrid Sins, and such
as are so very Evil, that they could come from
no other but from the Devil: such Sins as could
not be acted by Man in an ordinary course of
sinning. As <hi>Iudas</hi> his Treason, though he were
Devil enough to plot such a thing, yet it is said,
<hi>Satan put it into his Heart.</hi> And such singular
Diabolical Suggestions may be darted into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of Believers sometimes; Thoughts of Atheism,
Blasphemy, unnatural Sins, Self-murder, suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:47528:219"/>
of the Gospel; these things the Devil
throws in. Therefore, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 16. Believers
are warned to <hi>quench these fiery Darts,</hi> that the
Devil hurls into the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p>2. Every Man is haunted with special Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
from Temper, Sex, Age, Custom, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
Company, Course of Aflairs; these things
are often spoken of in Scripture. From <hi>Temper,</hi>
God makes use of Temper. For though he
plants all Grace in the Hearts of the Regenerate,
yet there are certain Graces wherein they are
eminent; as <hi>Timothy</hi> for Temperance, <hi>Moses</hi> for
Meekness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of the Law in
his Members, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. The Devil may find
Forces from the Temper of the Body to destroy
the Soul. So also from <hi>Sex,</hi> as <hi>he beguiled</hi> Eve,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. And from <hi>Age,</hi> we read of <hi>youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Lusts,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 22. And how strong the
Devil is about young Ones, 1 <hi>Iohn 2. 13. I have
written unto you young Men, because ye have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the wicked One.</hi> They are most assaulted
with Pride, with youthful Lusts suitable to their
Age. So from <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Education;</hi> Psal. 18.
23. <hi>I kept my self from mine Iniquity.</hi> Every
Man hath <hi>his</hi> Iniquity; that is, such as his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and Custom hath wrought upon him,
which makes the Sin prevail over other Sins. A
Child of God hath a predominant Sin, not over
Grace, (for that's inconsistent with sincerity)
but some Master-Sin which prevails over the rest:
according as the Channel is cut, so corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
runs, but some in this Channel, and some
in that: Every Man hath his special Sin, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the Devil plies him. Then our <hi>Calling</hi>
is a special Temptation; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:47528:219"/>
speaks, that a Bishop should <hi>not be a Novice,
lest being lifted up with pride, he fall into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the Devil.</hi> Pride, and Ostentation
of Gifts, and vain-Glory in such publick Service.
Many other Sins follow every Calling: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you would be skill'd in Satan's Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises,
you must mind Temper, Age, Calling.
So <hi>Company:</hi> As a Man's Company is, his Soul is
insensibly tainted. As a Man that walks in the
Sun is tann'd before he is aware: so are the Souls
of Men sullied and defiled by Carnal Company,
before they be aware. A Man would think of all
Sins, Passion is so uncomely, that it should not
tempt another Man: Yet it is said, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 24,
25. <hi>Make no friendship with an angry Man; and
with a furious Man thou shalt not go; lest thou learn
his ways, and get a Snare to thy Soul:</hi> for the more
accustomed to them, the less odious they seem;
so by little and little, our Spirits are shaped and
fitted for such a Sin. There are certain Sins
that are more special Temptations. Look, as
every Disease hath a Diet which suits with it, so
all Sins in the Soul, Satan knows what Baits we
will catch at. It may be, a Man that is addicted
to the Pleasures of the Flesh, may despise Profit,
and therefore the Devil will not ply him that
way. So a Man that is addicted to <hi>Gain,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth
pleasure. The Devil suits him with a
Bait, that suits the Disease of his Soul. It is an
Opinion the Devils have their several Wards
and Quarters; some for such a sort of Sinners,
others for another sort. Look, as the Heathens
had several Gods, (which were indeed Devils)
as <hi>Baccus,</hi> the God of Riot, or Patron of Good-fellowship;
and <hi>Venus</hi> of Wantonness and Love;
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:47528:220"/>
and <hi>Mars,</hi> the Devil of revengeful and angry
Spirits: And we read of <hi>Mammon</hi> for Wealth,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. I know it is a <hi>fictio personae,</hi> to make
the Matter more sensible, there is a Person feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But there may be something of this Truth
in it, that the Devils have several Quarters;
some to humour the <hi>Covetous;</hi> others inticing
the <hi>Wanton;</hi> others lie Leigers in Taverns, and
Drinking-Houses, to draw Men to beastly <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;</hi>
and others about the <hi>Revengeful,</hi> to awaken
their Rage. But all this, however it be, ('tis
the Opinion of some) should make us watchful
over our own Desires and Inclinations, for that's
it the Devil makes use of to set upon us.</p>
               <p>3. The Sin of the Devil <hi>tempting,</hi> must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from our Sin in <hi>consenting.</hi> If the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
tempt, and we consent not, it is his Sin. The
envious Man may throw Weeds over the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-wall;
but if we do not suffer them to root
there, it is not the Gardiner's fault, but the fault
of the envious Man: so the Devil may fling in
Temptations, Fiery Darts, Atheistical or
Blasphemous Thoughts; yet if we throw them
out with indignation, and give no harbour and
entertainment to them there, it is our misery,
but the Devil's sin; and therefore if our Hearts
abhor them at the very first rising, though they
be Man's Cross, they will be put upon <hi>Satan</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Satan,</hi> if he cannot prevail by the first
Temptation to draw us to <hi>Sin,</hi> he will seek to
prevail by a second or subsequent Temptation,
to draw us to trouble and discomfort. If he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
weaken Grace, he may molest and disturb
our Comfort, by flinging in a blasphemous
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:47528:220"/>
Thought, which is abhorr'd by a Christian. If
he cannot draw you to deny God, then he will
seek to cloud things, that you may suspect your
own estate; and thus our way is made wearisom
to us: Look, as a Candle which sticks to a Stone-Wall,
though it cannot burn the Wall, yet it
smutcheth, and defileth it: So the Children of
God, when the Devil seeks to make their Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
stick, though he doth not burn their
Hearts with these fiery Darts of Blasphemy
and Atheism, they catch not there, yet they
weaken our Comfort; and then his second
Temptation, is to bring us to doubt of God's
Love, to doubt of our own Faith, and to draw
us to impatiency and murmuring at God's Hand.
Therefore it should be our care, not only to
withstand the Devil's first Temptation, but his
second also.</p>
               <p>5. Certainly they cannot stand long, that seem
to give up themselves to <hi>Satan</hi>'s Snares. How
may this be done? Any Carnal Affection unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
layeth us open to the Devil; 1 Tim. 6. 9.
<hi>They that will be rich, fall into Temptation, and a
Snare, and into many foolish and hurtful Lusts,
which drown Men in Destruction and Perdition.</hi> If
a Man cherish his Worldliness, and do not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
it, he lieth ready to be seized upon as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Prey for <hi>Satan. Iudas,</hi> he had the Bag, and
he lay open to the Devil; his Worldliness increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon him, so the Devil entreth into him.
Again, when we ride into the Devil's Quarters,
and will parly with Temptation; when we free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
open the Windows of the Senses unto alluring
Objects, and can dally with the Snare, and play
about the Temptation, then we do but tempt
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:47528:221"/>
God to leave us, and tempt the Devil to surprise
us: <hi>And therefore be sober, be watchful, for your
Adversary, the Devil, walketh about like a roaring
Lion, seeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 8. <hi>Be
sober;</hi> What is sobriety? A holy Moderation
in the use of Worldy Things; be sure not to
leave any Carnal Affection unmortified. And
then be <hi>watchful,</hi> take heed not to play about
the Temptation, nor put your selves upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Sin, for then we lie open to the Devil,
and give him an advantage against us. Thus
much for the second sort of Temptations, such
as come from <hi>Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> sort of Temptations, are those
which arise from our own <hi>Hearts;</hi> so we call
these Urgings and Solicitations to sin, which we
feel in our Bosoms. Concerning this also, I shall
give some Observations.</p>
               <p>1. If there were no Devil to tempt us, yet the
Heart of Man is fruitful enough of all that is evil.
Mat. 15. 19. <hi>Out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts,
Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, false
Witnesses, Blasphemies.</hi> There's a black Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
and all comes out of the Heart of Man.
And among the rest, observe, there's <hi>Murder</hi>
which strikes at the Life of Man; and <hi>Blasphemy,</hi>
which strikes at the Honour and Being of God.
Though the Devil should stand by, and say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to us, we have enough within us to put
us upon all kind of evil. Jerem. 17. 9. <hi>The
Heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
wicked, who can know it?</hi> As to <hi>Actual Sins,</hi> there
is a difference; but as to <hi>Original Sin,</hi> it is the
same in all. All the <hi>Sins</hi> that ever have been, or
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:47528:221"/>
shall be committed in the World, they are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
in our Natures, they are but Original Sin
acted and drawn out this way, and that way, as all
numbers are but one multiplied: <hi>Cain</hi>'s Murder,
<hi>Iudas</hi>'s Treason, <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Apostacy and Enmity to
Christ, the Seed and Root of all is in our Nature;
and if we were but left to our selves, and had the
same Temptations and Occasions, we should be as
bad as others; such as we would not imagine
that ever we should commit, is in our heart;
2 King. 8. 13. <hi>Is thy Servant a Dog, that he should
do this great thing?</hi> when he had been told of
those horrid Cruelties he should act upon the
Women and Children of <hi>Israel.</hi> No Man knows
the depth of his own Wickedness, if loosned of
his Chain, and the Restraints are taken off. At
first Nature abhors them in the conceit of them;
but when God permits us to lie under the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and fair Occasion, Man is not to be
trusted. We see, in this respect, what need
there is to pray that God would not leave us
under the Power of Temptation, because the
Heart of Man is prone, naturally inclinable to
all evil. There are new Actual Sins; but there
is no new Original Sin, that is but one and the
same in all Persons, and at all Times; the Root
of all the Mischief which hath been in the World,
is within us.</p>
               <p>2. That without the <hi>Flesh,</hi> the <hi>World</hi> and the
<hi>Devil</hi> can have no power over us. A Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be compell'd to sin, against his own consent;
he may be compell'd to suffer Temptation, but
he is a Sinner by his own choice. The World
would not hurt us, were it not for Lust in the
Heart; 2 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>Escaping the Corruption of the
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:47528:222"/>
World through Lust.</hi> I say, it is not the <hi>beauty</hi> or
<hi>sweetness</hi> of the Creature, but Lust, which is our
Ruin and Undoing, and that makes the World
so dangerous unto us. A Spider sucketh Poison
from the same Flower from which a Bee would
suck Hony; the fault is not in the Flower, but
in the Spider. The Devil can do nothing, unless
we give him leave. The Fire is kindled in our
<hi>own Bosoms,</hi> Satan only doth <hi>blow</hi> it up into a
Flame, saith <hi>Nazianzen:</hi> We have the Coals in
our own Hearts, the Devil doth but come and
blow them up. <hi>Suggestion</hi> doth nothing without
<hi>consent.</hi> In vain doth one knock at the Door, and
none within to look out and make answer: So,
all other Temptations would be in vain, if there
were not somewhat within that would close with
what is suggested from <hi>Satan;</hi> James 1. 14.
<hi>Every Man is tempted, when he is drawn away of
his own Lust, and enticed,</hi> by his own Concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
If your Hearts did not yield, if you did
resist, the Devil and the World could not force
you. When Satan came to Christ, he might <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest</hi>
him, but he found nothing <hi>in</hi> him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.
30. As a Glass of pure Water may be shaken,
but there is no Filth, no Mud there discovered:
But now, the best of Men, they have somewhat
within them, Naughtiness and Corruption enough
in their own Hearts, upon which Satan may
work, and inflame them with his fiery Darts. In
short; <hi>We may commit Sin without Satan, but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
cannot betray us to sin without our selves;</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have his desire upon us, without us.</p>
               <p>3. The Flesh doth not only make us <hi>flexible</hi>
and <hi>yielding</hi> to Temptations, but is <hi>active</hi> and
stirring in our Hearts, to force and impel us
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:47528:222"/>
thereunto. There's <hi>a Law in our Members,</hi> Rom.
7. 23. a powerful active Principle within us, that
is always urging us to sin. We think, and speak
too gently of our own corrupt Hearts, when we
think the Corruption is sleepy, and works not
untill it be irritated by outward Objects, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
Suggestions: No, there's an active stirring
Principle within us, that poureth out Sin as a
Fountain doth Waters, though no Body comes to
drink of them; as <hi>Gen. 6. 5. Every imagination
of the Thoughts of his Heart, is only evil continually.</hi>
There is a Mint in Man's Heart that is always at
work, coining evil Thoughts, evil Desires, evil
Motions; and <hi>the flesh lusteth against the Spirit,
Gal. 5. 17. And Sin wrought in me all manner of
Concupiscence,</hi> Rom. 7. 8. Though there were
no other occasion to irritate, but God's Law, and
the Motions of his Spirit, yet there's a continual
Fermentation wrought by these corrupt Humors
in our Hearts. Natural Concupiscence doth not
lie idle in them, but is active, and warring; and
the Objects that are in the World, and the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations
of the Devil make it more violent.</p>
               <p>4. The Temptations of the Flesh and the World
go in conjunction, and do mutually help one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And therefore it is said, 1 Joh. 2. 16. <hi>For
all that is in the World, the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust
of the Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. Mark, (whatever is in the
World) he doth not mention the <hi>Object,</hi> but the
<hi>Lusts,</hi> because these are complicated and folded up
together in the Temptation. The <hi>Bait</hi> is the
<hi>World;</hi> but the <hi>Appetite</hi> and Desire we have from
the <hi>Flesh.</hi> And this is intimated in that Passage,
Jam. 1. 14. <hi>Every Man is tempted when he is drawn
away of his own Lust, and enticed.</hi> There's two
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:47528:223"/>
Words there, (drawn away, and enticed): the
<hi>drawing away,</hi> notes the vehemency of desire, or
Inclination of our own Hearts; and the <hi>enticement</hi>
that's from the Object. Both ways doth Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
work, by Force and Flattery. The great
<hi>Bait</hi> is Pleasure, the contentment that we take in
outward Enjoyments. And we are carried out to
it by the vehement propension of corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>5. This vehement propension of Corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to outward things is set at work by a <hi>hope</hi> of
<hi>gaining</hi> them, or a <hi>fear</hi> to <hi>lose</hi> them; and so we
are assaulted on every hand, by right-hand, and
left-hand Temptations. By <hi>right-hand</hi> Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the Flatteries, and Comforts of the
World; which are the more dangerous, because
of their easy Insinuation into, and strong Operation
upon our Hearts, and so our Comforts prove a
Snare to us, and <hi>an occasion to the Flesh,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13. And then there are <hi>left-hand</hi>
Temptations, which arise from shame or fear of
worldly Evils, as the other did arise from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
or hope of good. So the Apostle, Gal. 6. 12.
<hi>As many as desire to make a fair shew in the Flesh, they
constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should
suffer persecution for the Cross of Christ.</hi> That was
their temporizing then to comply with the <hi>Iews,</hi>
who had some National Priviledges under the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Government, and had better security to their
worldly Interests, than possibly thorow Christians
could have. Now to avoid both these, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
when he presseth Christians to all those Graces
which are necessary, he presseth them to Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Patience, 2 Pet. 1. 5, 6. <hi>Add to Knowledg
Temperance, and to Temperance Patience.</hi> Both these
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:47528:223"/>
are Armor of Proof against worldly Temptations;
<hi>Temperance</hi> against the <hi>Delights,</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Evils</hi> and <hi>Troubles</hi> of the World. It
was never yet so well with the World, but that
Christians (those that are so in good earnest, that
mean to go to Heaven and keep a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
will be assaulted on both sides.</p>
               <p>6. That there is no avoiding either of these
Snares and Temptations as long as any Carnal
Affection remaineth unmortified. For until a
Man be dead to worldly Comforts, and hardned
against worldly Sorrows, he doth but lye naked
and open to Satan, 1 Tim. 6. 9. <hi>He that will be rich,
falls into Temptation, and a Snare.</hi> And what is
said of Riches, the same is true of <hi>Pleasure;</hi> he
that is vehemently addicted that way, will soon
come to put God out of the Throne, and make
his Belly, and his Pleasure, his God; 2 Tim. 3.
4. <hi>Lovers of Pleasures, more than Lovers of God:</hi>
Any Lust that is cherished and indulged, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
us. As for <hi>Honour;</hi> John 5. 44. <hi>How can
ye believe, which receive Honour one of another, and
seek not the Honour that cometh from God only?
True Faith</hi> cannot be planted in that Heart that
is not <hi>purified,</hi> until there be a prevailing Interest
established for Christ, over all Carnal Affections.
Grace bears no sway in us, and hath no power
over us. The ambition and love of respect from
Men, will necessarily make us unsound in the
profession of Godliness. Well then, it stands us
upon, to allow and cherish no secret Sin, but to
observe what are the tender parts of our Hearts,
or which way our Corruptions lie, where subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to God is most apt to stick with us: Psal.
119. 133. <hi>Order my Steps in thy Word: and let
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:47528:224"/>
not any Iniquity have dominion over me.</hi> Though
we seem to have a Zeal in other things, yet if
one Lust be indulged, we shall soon swerve from
our Duty. True Obedience to God, is inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with the Dominion of any one Lust, or
corrupt Affection. I say, though a Man, out of
some slender and insufficient touch of Religion
upon his Heart, may go right for a while, and do
many things gladly; yet that corruption which
is indulged, and under the power of which a Man
lieth, will at length draw him off from God;
and therefore no one Sin should have dominion
over us. When doth Sin reign, or have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over us? When we do not endeavour to
mortify it, and to cut off the Provisions that may
feed that Lust. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Observation is, The
Apostle doth not say, Let it not <hi>tyrannize</hi> over
you, but let it not <hi>reign</hi> over you; that is, when
you suffer it to have a quiet Reign in your
Hearts.</p>
               <p>7. The more we sin, upon the meer impulsion
of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and without an <hi>external</hi> Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the more hainous is our Offence, for then
the Heart is carried of its own accord to sin.
Ezek. 16. 33, 34. <hi>They give Gifts to all Whores:
but thou givest thy Gifts to all thy Lovers, and hirest
them, that they may come unto thee for thy Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
And the contrary is in thee from [other] Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in thy Whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee
to commit Whoredoms: and in that thou givest a
Reward, and no Reward is given unto thee; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou art contrary.</hi> These are Expressions to
set forth their Idolatry. But that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
there, is this, That they were not desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or solicited, but meerly carried to sin by
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:47528:224"/>
their own proper Motion, which exceedingly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravateth
Sin; Why? for then it is a sign the
Heart is carried of its own accord, by its own
weight, as a heavy Body is moved downward,
not by the impression of outward Force, but by
its own natural propension.</p>
               <p>Now when do Men thus meerly sin, upon the
impulsions of the Flesh? I'le instance in three
Cases.</p>
               <p>1. When the Temptation is so <hi>small</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable,
that it should not sway with any
reasonable Man. It is said, in <hi>Amos 2. 6. They
sold the Poor for a pair of Shoes.</hi> And <hi>for a piece
of Bread will that Man transgress,</hi> Prov. 28. 21.
When Pleasure and Profit is so inconsiderable, as
that it could not rationally make up a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then Men sin meerly upon the Corruptions
of their own Flesh. When the Devil hath to do
with great Souls, such as Christ was, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<hi>the Glory of all the World,</hi> Mat. 4. O!
but a lesser price will serve the turn, with those
that are deeply engaged already, that are byas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with their own propension; (for instance) a
little ease, and carnal satisfaction, a slothful
Humour, is enough to take them off from the
sweetness of Communion with God, and the
pleasure and contentment that they might enjoy
with him in holy Exercises. Look as in general,
it is a great aggravation of all Sin, that for such
paltry Trifles, we turn the back upon God and
his Grace: all Sinners do so, they part with all
their Hopes by Christ, for a Mess of Pottage, for
a little present Pleasure; that's prophaneness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 16. So in particular things, when
the smallest Temptation seems to be strong
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:47528:225"/>
enough to draw off our Hearts from our Duty,
to bring us to a Sin of <hi>Omission,</hi> when it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to go and converse with God in secret; a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ease, and sloth, hangs upon us, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
shake it off: or when we are drawn to a Sin
of <hi>Commission,</hi> by an inconsiderable Matter, by
the smallest worldly Interest as can be mentioned,
for a piece of Bread, and a pair of Shoes.</p>
               <p>2. When Men tempt themselves, or provoke
Satan to tempt them. As those <hi>which make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for the Flesh, to fulfil the Lusts thereof,</hi> Rom.
13. 14. that cater for their Lusts, and contrive
how to feed them, and how to cherish those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Affections in their Hearts; that run into
the Devil's Quarters, that bespeak a Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
or, as it is <hi>Iames 5. 5. That nourish their
Hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</hi> To nourish our
Hearts, is to feed our Lusts, to put strength into
the Enemy's Hand. When a Commander sent
to his Prince, to know how he should keep such
a rebellious Town in order: He sent him this
Answer, That he should starve the Dog, and
strengthen the Clog; that he should weaken the
City, and strengthen the Garison; that was his
meaning. Truly, what was his advice in that
outward Case, that's the Duty of a Christian, to
weaken his Lusts, and still to be strengthning
Grace. He should be increasing the better Part,
and putting the Spirit in heart, by godly Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises;
by treasuring up Promises, getting Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and fresh Encouragements against Sin;
and by weakning the Flesh, starving and cutting
off Provisions for the Flesh. But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
when Men cater for the Flesh, provide for
it, indulge carnal Distempers, and feed them
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:47528:225"/>
with that Diet which they affect: These tempt
themselves, and seem willing to lie under their
Bondage, and to be glad of it.</p>
               <p>3. When a Man is a Sinner to his <hi>loss;</hi> and
hath Reasons of Nature to disswade him, as well
as Reasons of Grace; not only <hi>Religion,</hi> but his
civil <hi>Interests,</hi> would counsel him to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
as he that brings a Blot upon his Name,
or Ruin upon his Estate, by evil Courses; when
Men <hi>draw on Iniquity with a Cart-rope,</hi> as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
is, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 18. that is, when it is not Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but a very Toil and Burden, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inconvenience to them to be sinful; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously
make it their business; those that are
<hi>holden with the Cords of their own Sins,</hi> Prov. 5. 22.
He speaks of such as did bring temporal Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
upon themselves; as did consume their
Flesh, and their own Bodies; these certainly are
those that have cause to complain of their own
Hearts, not to put it on Satan, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>II. Having opened the Nature of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I come now to give the Reasons why this is
so usual an Evil we encounter with in the World,
<hi>Temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. God permits it for his own Glory, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Power, the <hi>Freeness</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> of his
Grace, that Men may be driven the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
to sue out their Peace in the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. <hi>Luther</hi> propounds this Reason; Tho
Man be prone to sin of himself, of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
yet God suffers the Tempter to be in the
World, because Man is backward to seek Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Grace by Christ; and therefore God
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:47528:226"/>
urgeth him with sore Temptations. Certainly
this Reason was given by him not amiss. You
know, when <hi>Paul</hi> felt those Paroxisms, and sad
Counter-buffs in his own Spirit, this makes him
bless God for Jesus Christ. Rom. 7. 25. <hi>But
thanks be to God, through Iesus Christ our Lord:</hi>
It makes him reflect upon the Grace of God in
Christ. We keep off from the Throne of Grace,
till Temptations drive us thither. As when the
Sheep wander, the Shepherd lets loose his Dog
upon them; not to worry them, but to bring
them back to the Fold again: so God lets loose
Satan to drive us to himself.</p>
               <p>2. For the trial of that Grace which he hath
wrought in us. Grace doth better appear in
Temptation, than out of it. The greatness of
the Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi>'s Faith would never have
been discovered, had it not been for Christ's
Answer and Denial, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 25, 28. Then, <hi>O
Woman, great is thy Faith.</hi> The Glory of that
Grace which God hath wrought in his People,
would not be discovered so much, were it not
for the great Trials he puts them upon: Heb.
11. 17. <hi>By Faith</hi> Abraham, <hi>when he was tried, offered
up</hi> Isaac. Before we go to Heaven, we shall have
our Trials, and shall be tried in our dearest
Comforts, and choicest worldly Contentments;
and all, to see what Faith we have, and what
Loyalty to God in the midst of these Trials. A
great Tempest discovereth the goodness of a
Ship, and skill of the Pilot; and so these great
Trials, they discover the soundness of our Hearts,
and the fruit of that Grace which God hath
wrought in us. Gold is most tried in the Fire,
and discovered to be pure and perfect. Stars that
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:47528:226"/>
lie hid in the Day, shine in the Night. We have
but dry Notions of the Comforts of Christianity<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and make them matter of talk, until we are put
upon great Trials, then is our belief and sense
of them proved. A gilded Potsherd may shine,
until it comes to scouring; but then the Varnish
and Paint is worn off. The Valour and Worth
of a Souldier, is not known in times of Peace,
and when he is out of Action. When we are put
to some difficulty and straits, then is Faith seen.
Now this is a very pleasing Spectacle to God, to
see them approve their Faith and Loyalty to his
Majesty.</p>
               <p>3. Temptations, as they serve to prove, so
also to humble us, that we may never be proud
of what we have, or conceited of what we have
not. As <hi>Paul,</hi> that he might not be exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
measure, he was buffeted with a Messenger
of Satan, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. Poor Bladders we are,
soon blown up and swoln into Vanity, and vain
Conceits of our selves; therefore had need be
pricked, that we may let out those swelling
Winds. A Ship that is loaden with precious
Ware, needs to be ballasted with Wood, Stones,
or contemptible Stuff. But why will God hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
us by Temptations, and such kind of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
as are solicitatious to Evil? <hi>Answer,</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Evils need a Spiritual Cure. Outward
Afflictions they humble, but not so much as
Temptations do; they are not so conducible to
humble a gracious Heart, as Temptations to Sin.
Why? For then the Breach is made upon our
Souls, and the Assault is given to that which a
gracious Man counts to be dear; and therefore
these are suffered to come upon us. If any
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:47528:227"/>
thing will humble a Child of God, this will do
it. It may be he may bear up under losses tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably;
but when his Peace comes to be assaulted,
and his Grace, this will humble him to purpose.
Worldly Men, they value their Estate by their
outward Interest; But a Child of God, by his
Peace of Conscience, and his thriving in Grace;
O this wounds him to the Heart, when in either
of these he suffers loss: This sets him a praying
and groaning to God, as <hi>Paul</hi> groans bitterly
when he felt those gripes of Sin, and those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctances
in his Heart, <hi>(O wretched Man!</hi> &amp;c.)
Afflictions, they conduce to <hi>humble and prove us,</hi>
Deut. 8. 16. And besides too, the Lord loves
to make the Cause of our Mischief, to be the
Means of our Cure. This giveth us the sight of
some Corruption we saw not before.</p>
               <p>4. God permits this Exercise to his People, to
conform us to Christ. We must pledg him in
his own Cup, it must go round; He himself was
tempted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 7. Christ hath felt the weight,
burden, and trouble of Temptations, and knows
the danger of them. Now the Disciple is not
above his Lord, nor the Scholar above his Master.
The Devil that did set upon Christ, will not be
afraid of us.</p>
               <p>5. By Temptations to Sin, God morti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eth
Sin; not only that Sin to which we are tempted,
but others, that we may not be so heedless:
When we have smarted under Temptation, we
are not so indulgent to Corruption as before; we
do not let our Senses nor Affections run loose;
as <hi>David</hi> speaks, that he got this by his Fall,
<hi>Psal. 51. 6. In the hidden part thou shalt make me
to know Wisdom:</hi> O, I shall be wiser and more
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:47528:227"/>
circumspect for this all my Life. When Men
have smarted, they grow more cautious; and so,
by the over-ruling and good Hand of God, our
Sins do us service in our passage to Heaven, as well
as our Graces: And God's Children may say,
they had sinned more, if they had sinned less:
They are more acquainted with the Wiles and
Depths of Satan, and Naughtiness of their own
Hearts, and so are more solicitous.</p>
               <p>6. To make us more meek to others; Gal. 6. 1.
<hi>If any Man be fallen, ye which are spiritual, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
such a one in the Spirit of Meekness, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thy self, lest thou also be tempted.</hi> We are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
apt to be severe and fierce upon the failings of
others. But now, when we are tempted our
selves, we learn more pity and compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. Severe Censurers are left to some
great Temptation, that they may be acquainted
with their own Frailties: they are tempted to
some Sins, to which their Hearts were not so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
before. Well then, that we may pity
others, mourn over them, and have a fellow-feeling
of their Condition, God will make us
know the Heart of a tempted Man, that we may
have more compassion over poor tempted Souls.
Possibly that may be a part of the Apostle's sense,
2 <hi>Cor. 1. 6. Whether we be afflicted, it is for your
Consolation and Salvation: or whether we be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it is for your Consolation and Salvation.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in Office in the Church, they are afflicted
and tempted; and it may be, have a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Afflictions and Temptations, that they
may shew more pity to other Souls. Therefore
<hi>Luther</hi> was wont to say, Three things made a
Minister, <hi>(viz.) Prayer, Meditation,</hi> and <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:47528:228"/>
When he is much in communion with
God, much in the study of the Word, and hath
been exercised in Temptation, then he will be of
a tender and compassionate Heart over others;
and that he may help them out of the Snares of
the Devil, he is more fitted to his Work by
Temptation.</p>
               <p>7. It occasions much Experience of the Care
and Providence of God, and the Comforts of his
Promises. A Man doth not know what the
Comforts of Faith mean, till he be exercised by
Temptation. And Spiritual Experiences, will
countervail all other Troubles. This is an Hour
of Temptation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 10. What should we do
in this Hour of Temptation? Be not over-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
nor over-diffident, in an hour when God
casts us upon trying Times. Not <hi>over-confident,</hi>
in casting your selves upon needless Troubles
without cause: <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 28. Peter <hi>said, Lord,
if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the Water.
Peter</hi> thought he could do any thing in the
strength of Christ's Word; <hi>Peter</hi> seeks a Call
before it be given him. Nor yet be <hi>over-backward</hi>
and diffident to own God, and the Truths of
God. As <hi>Paul</hi> taxed <hi>Peter</hi> for dissembling, <hi>Gal.</hi>
2. 12. when those false Brethren were likely to
bring great trouble, <hi>Peter</hi> dissembled and runs
with them, and separates himself from the purer
sort of Christians, he is taxed there for it. We
should not run into them without cause, nor yet
be ashamed to own the ways of God, those
which are most agreeable to his Holy Word.
Not be solicitous so much about Events, as Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
for God is far more concerned than we,
and hath a greater Interest than we can have.
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:47528:228"/>
What's our Interest, and the Interest of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and our Children, to the great Interest
of God, the Safety of his Children, the Safety
of his Glory, and Cause of his Church? Be not
troubled about <hi>Events,</hi> for all our Business is to
understand our Duty, that we may not sin, but
keep blameless in the Hour of Temptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> If Temptations be an usual Evil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we encounter in the present World. Then,

enter into the Lists with Satan, resist the Devil:

in your Brethren, that are in the Flesh.</hi> They
are all troubled with a busy Devil, a naughty
World, and a corrupt Heart! And why should
we look for a total Exemption, and to go to
Heaven in an unusual way?</p>
               <p>That we may not be dismay'd by Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I shall give you several Considerations.</p>
               <p>1. We took an Oath to fight under Christ's
Banner. Baptism it is, <hi>Sacramentum Militare,</hi>
our Military Oath, which we took to fight in
Christ's Cause, against all the Oppositions and
Difficulties we meet with in the World. 1 Pet.
3. 21. The Apostle calls Baptism, <hi>The Answer of
a good Conscience towards God.</hi> An Answer sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
a Question. It is an Allusion to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
propounded by the Catechist to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumen.
When they came to desire Baptism,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:47528:229"/>
they asked them, <hi>Abrenuncias?</hi> dost thou renounce
the World, the Flesh, and the Devil? And
they answered, <hi>Abrenuncio?</hi> I do renounce them.
So, <hi>Credis?</hi> Dost thou believe in Jesus Christ
with all thy Heart? as <hi>Philip</hi> propounds the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
to the Eunuch; and they answered, <hi>Credo,</hi>
I do believe. Wilt thou undertake to walk in
all Holy Obedience? and the Answer is, I do
undertake before God. Conscience, which is
God's Deputy, puts the Question, in God's
Name, to those which take the Seals of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
Are you willing to renounce the Flesh,
and worldly Vanities? Will you cleave to God,
and his Ways, what-ever they cost you? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
makes this Answer, is supposed that he
makes it knowingly, that he doth understand
the Difficulties of Salvation, and what he must
meet with in his way to Heaven. So the Apostle
saith, <hi>You are not Debtors to the Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sh,</hi> Rom. 8. 12.
A Man is a Debtor to another, either by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of some received Benefit, or by his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Promise and Engagement; both are of use
in that place. They that would seek the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
of their Souls, need not gratify the Flesh.
They that are engaged to walk after the Spirit,
and come under the Bond of an Holy Oath, and
that are thus solemnly engaged, cannot expect
to carry on the Profession of Godliness without
Conflicts, and multiplied Difficulties.</p>
               <p>2. That is not the happiest Condition, which
is most quiet and free from the Temptations of
Satan; for, <hi>Luke 11. 21. When the strong Man
armed keepeth his Palace, his Goods are in peace.</hi>
When the Devil hath-quiet possession, he doth
not trouble Men. The Sea must needs be smooth
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:47528:229"/>
and calm, when Wind and Tide go one way.
There are some which suspect their Condition,
because of <hi>continual</hi> Temptation; and others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have <hi>no</hi> Temptation. Neither is a
safe Rule; for the time of our Conflict may not
yet become. But if any have cause to suspect
themselves, it is the last sort; for they that are
least troubled, may be most hurt; they are quiet
and secure, because Satan hath got them into
his Snare, and hath a quiet Dominion in their
Souls.</p>
               <p>3. Jesus Christ himself was tempted; and
therefore we should not be dismayed with Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
Upon several Accounts is this a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to us; <hi>partly,</hi> as it shews that we cannot look
for an Exemption, for the Captain of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
was thus exercised, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. Be not
disconsolate, it becomes good Souldiers to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their Captain. We are to pledg him in this
Cup. He was tempted, therefore we shall be
tempted. <hi>Partly</hi> and chiefly, because now he is
more likely to pity us. It is said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 18.
<hi>Wherefore he is able to succour those that are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
Jesus Christ hath felt the weight and
trouble of Temptations, therefore sure he will
pity us, if we lie under Griefs and Dangers;
as a Man that hath been Shipwrack'd himself, is
the more likely to pity others in their distress,
when they have lost all. One that knows Evils
by guess and imagination, knows them only at a
distance, and doth not know how evil they are;
but he that knows them by Experience, he knows
them at hand, and by such a smart sense, as must
needs leave a deep stroke and impression upon
the Soul. So Jesus Christ, that hath had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:47528:230"/>
Knowledg, that knows the Heart of
a tempted Man, can more feelingly succour those
that are tempted; his Heart becomes tender by
Experience; he knows the Danger and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
we are subject unto; therefore be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed.
And <hi>partly</hi> too, because by suffering
this Evil in his own Person, he hath pull'd out the
Sting of Temptation. Christ sanctified every
Condition that he passed through; his being
<hi>poor,</hi> hath pull'd out the Sting of <hi>Poverty.</hi> It is
the more comportable now to a godly poor Man,
one that hath an Interest in Christ; his <hi>dying</hi>
hath pull'd out the Sting of <hi>Death;</hi> so that what
is to him a <hi>Prison,</hi> (Isa. 53. 8. <hi>He shall be taken
from Prison, and from Iudgment)</hi> is to us a Bed of
<hi>ease;</hi> Isa. 57. 2. <hi>They shall r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st in their Beds:</hi> so
his being <hi>tempted,</hi> hath unstung <hi>Temptations,</hi> and
hath made them not so grievous. And <hi>partly</hi> too,
as he hath directed us how to stand out, and with
what kind of Weapons to foil <hi>Satan.</hi> Christ,
that is a Pattern of <hi>doing,</hi> and <hi>suffering,</hi> is also a
Pattern of <hi>resisting.</hi> He that left us an Example
of doing the Will of God, and by suffering with
Meekness; and when he was reviled, reviled not
again: So in resisting Temptations, hath he left
us an Example, hath taught us how to grapple
with the Devil, and in what manner to repress
his Temptation; therefore we should not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
dismay'd.</p>
               <p>4. Consider the Comforts of the Tempted.
Abundantly hath God provided for his Servants
in their Conflicts.</p>
               <p>(1.) Jesus Christ, our General, the Captain
of our Salvation, in whose Quarrel we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
hath <hi>overcome</hi> all our <hi>Enemies,</hi> we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:47528:230"/>
in his Victory, <hi>Iohn 16. 33. In the World
ye shall have tribulation: but be of good chear, I
have overcome the World.</hi> We may have many
pressing and searching Troubles, but the Sting of
them is gone. <hi>Non pugna sublata est, sed Victoria,</hi>
Christ hath not taken away the Combat, we
must fight; but the Victory is sure, <hi>He hath
overcome the World.</hi> This is our Comfort, when
we are full of Faintings and Fears, that all things
are vanquished and overcome by Christ; that
though they <hi>terrify</hi> us, yet they shall not <hi>hurt</hi> us.
Though Christ will not exempt us from Battel,
yet we have to do with the Devil, the World,
and Death, which are all vanquished Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>(2.) He hath a tender <hi>sense</hi> and a <hi>knowledg</hi> of
our Estate. Christ saith to <hi>Peter, Satan hath a
desire to have you, that he may sift you as Wheat:
but I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.
Luke</hi> 22. 32. Christ's Love and Mercy is never
more at work for his People, than when they
are most assaulted by Satan; then is he interced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for them. John 13. 1. <hi>Iesus having loved his
own which were in the World, he loved them unto
the end.</hi> When Christ was about to go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
he thought, my own are to be left in the
World, they are exposed to great Temptation;
and that set his heart a-work, as if he had
said, Poor Creatures, they are undone if I help
them not. So, <hi>Zech. 3. 1, 2. And he shewed me</hi>
Joshua <hi>the High Priest, standing before the Angel of
the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to
resist him. And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord
rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath chosen</hi>
Jerusalem, <hi>rebuke thee: Is not this a Brand pluckt
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:47528:231"/>
out of the Fire? And he shewed me!</hi> our whole
Case and Danger, it is clearly known to Christ.
He knows how Satan molests and troubles you in
your approaches to God; how he seeks to divert
your Thoughts, to weaken your Confidence. We
have a Friend and Advocate, that puts forth the
strength of his Mediation and Intercession, and
is zealous and affectionate for the welfare of his
People. <hi>The Lord that hath chosen</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(3.) He is engaged in the Battel, and fights
with us, by renewing the strength of his own
Grace. Phil. 4. 13. <hi>I can do all things through
Christ which strengthneth me.</hi> He gives relief and
help, according to the nature of the Conflict.
If there be Duty to be done, Burden to be born,
or Battel to be fought, Christ is giving in supply.
As the Olive Trees <hi>(Zech.</hi> 4. 11, 12.) were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
dropping into the Lamps; so is he drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in strength and Grace into the Heart.
Psal. 16. 8. <hi>I have set the Lord always before me;
because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</hi>
When a Man hath an able Second, he doth, with
the more courage, go to the Conflict: God is
on our right Hand, he is our Second, his Grace
comes into the Combat, and then the Field can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be lost. If we would exercise Faith in God,
we might be the more confident.</p>
               <p>(4.) He will reward us when we have done.
Hold fast to the end, and I'le give thee a Crown
of Life, a Garland of Immortality, that shall
never wither. If you will but hold out, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to fight the good Fight of Faith, there will
a time of triumph come. He that's now a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
shall be a Conqueror, when the Crown
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:47528:231"/>
of Righteousness shall be put upon his Head,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. And mark that, <hi>Rom. 16. 20. And
the God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
shortly.</hi> 'Tis troublesome to be in the World,
but <hi>shortly</hi> God shall <hi>bruise</hi> Satan: Mark, he doth
not only say, God shall <hi>tread</hi> Satan, but tread
him under your <hi>feet,</hi> triumph over him. As
<hi>Ioshua</hi> call'd upon his Companions, come set your
feet upon the Necks of these Kings, when they
were hid in the Cave; so the God of Peace shall
tread Satan under your feet shortly. Then your
Comfort will be greater, the more Dangers you
have gone through. As Travellers, when they
are come to their Inn, and to their Home, they
sweetly remember the Trouble and Danger of
the Road: So, when we are come to Heaven,
these Temptations will increase our rejoicing, and
our triumph in God.</p>
               <p>(5.) Even before the Battel, a Believer may
be sure of <hi>Victory.</hi> In other Fights, the Event is
uncertain. <hi>Non aequè glorietur accinctus, ac dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctus.
Let not him that girdeth on his Harness,
boast himself, as he that putteth it off,</hi> 1 Kings 20.
11. When a Field is won, then they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice:
But a Believer, when he goes to fight, is
sure to have the best of it before-hand, <hi>in Bello,</hi>
the <hi>War,</hi> though not <hi>in Praelio,</hi> the particular
Conflict: Why? Because the Father and Jesus
Christ are stronger than all his Enemies, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pluck the Believer out of his Hands; John
10. 28, 29. <hi>I give to them Eternal Life, and they
shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out
of my Father's Hand. My Father which gave them
me, is greater than all: and none is able to pluck
them out of my Father's Hand.</hi> This is the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:47528:232"/>
which Christ conferreth upon his Sheep,
upon those which have an Interest in him; tho
they have many shakings and tossings in their
Condition, yet their final perseverance is certain.
Christ is so <hi>unchangeable</hi> in the purposes of his
<hi>Love, I will give to them Eternal Life;</hi> and so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible</hi>
in the <hi>Power of his Grace, None shall pull
them out of my Father's Hand;</hi> nothing shall be
able to hinder their perseverance. Now though
the Fight be long and troublesom, yet this is
one of God's Encouragements, you are sure of
Victory at last. Therefore how much doth it
concern us to get an Interest in Christ, that we
may keep on in this Way, and in this Hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> Let us be provided and prepared
against Temptations. And to this end I
shall,
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Give some Directions how to resist
Temptations in General.</item>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> What to do in a special Hour of
Temptation which comes upon the
World;</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>When there are Terrors without, and we
know not what Evil may be a coming, and our
Hearts are full of Doubt, how we may support
and bear up our selves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To direct you as to Temptations in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. You must be <hi>compleatly armed.</hi> Ephes. 6. 11.
<hi>Put on the whole Armour of God, that ye may be
able to stand against the Wiles of the Devil:</hi> Not
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:47528:232"/>
a piece only, but the whole Armor of God,
otherwise you will never come off with Honour
and Safety, from the Spiritual Conflict. The
Poets feign of their <hi>Achilles,</hi> that he was vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
only in the Heel, and there he got his
Death's Wound. A Christian; though he be
never so well furnished in other parts, yet if
any part be left naked, you are in danger. Our
first Parents were wounded in their Heel. Who
would have thought, that they which had such
vast knowledg of God, and his Creatures, that
they should be inticed by Appetite? And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
who had the upper part of his Soul so well
guarded, that he should be enticed by Women?
To see Men of great knowledg to be unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and miscarry by their sensual Appetite, is
sad. A Christian must have no saving-Grace
wanting; 2 Pet. 1. 5. <hi>Add to your Faith, Vertue;
and to Vertue, Knowledg,</hi> &amp;c. There's all the
Graces, and they must come out in their turn.
We need <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Vertue, Zeal</hi> and <hi>Holiness;</hi>
and <hi>Knowledg</hi> to guide it, and <hi>Patience</hi> to arm it
against the Troubles of the present Life; and
we need <hi>Temperance</hi> to moderate our Affections
to our worldly Enjoyments; and <hi>Godliness,</hi> that
we may be frequent in communion with God;
and <hi>Brotherly-kindness,</hi> that we may preserve
Peace among our Brethren, and may not make
Fractions and Ruptures in the Church; and we
need <hi>Charity,</hi> that we may be useful to all that are
about us. There is use and work for all Graces,
one time or other: Sometimes we shall be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a neglect of <hi>God;</hi> at other times we shall
be tempted to make a breach upon <hi>Brotherly-kindness;</hi>
at other times there will be a breach
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:47528:233"/>
of <hi>Charity.</hi> Sometimes the Devil seeks to tempt
us to <hi>fleshly</hi> wickedness, therefore we need <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi>
sometimes to <hi>spiritual</hi> Wickedness, to
Error, therefore we need <hi>Knowledg;</hi> sometimes
to raging with <hi>despair,</hi> then we need <hi>Faith.</hi> We
need the whole Armour of God, for Satan hath
his various ways of Battery and Assault; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
through <hi>Ignorance,</hi> we miscarry and run
into <hi>Error;</hi> sometimes, for want of <hi>Faith,</hi> we
run into <hi>Despair</hi> and Discomfort; sometimes,
for want of <hi>Temperance,</hi> violent corrupt <hi>Lusts</hi>
over-set the Soul.</p>
               <p>2. We must often pray to God for renewed
Influences; we must not only get <hi>habits</hi> of
Grace, but pray for a renewed <hi>Influence.</hi> It is
notable, next to the Spiritual Armour, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
mentioneth <hi>Prayer,</hi> Ephes. 6. 18. <hi>Praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit,
and watching thereunto with all Perseverance.</hi> We
never receive so much from God upon Earth, as
to stand in need of no more: And therefore
though you put on the whole Armour of God,
yet <hi>praying always with all supplication in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi>
Why? Because without the Lord's special
Assistance, whereby he actuates those Graces, we
can never defend our selves, nor offend the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
or do any thing to purpose in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Life. Strength of Grace inherent, will
not bear us out against new Assaults. Habitual
Grace, it needs Actual Influence; partly, that
these Graces may be applied, and excited to
work. Phil. 2. 13. <hi>He giveth, to will and to do:</hi>
God giveth to <hi>do;</hi> that is, excites that strength
you have, and carrieth it out to work; and then
that it may be directed in <hi>work,</hi> 2 Thess. 3. 5.
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:47528:233"/>
                  <hi>And the Lord direct your Hearts into the Love of
God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time we would make use of the Helmet of
Salvation, when we would lift up the Head, and
wait for the Mercy of God, <hi>(the Lord direct you)</hi>
we must be directed. And not only so, but that
it may be supplied with <hi>new strength;</hi> for it is
said, <hi>Isa. 40. 29. He giveth Power to the faint,
and to them that have no Power he increaseth strength.</hi>
And he doth continue it; <hi>Luke 22. 32. I have
prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.</hi> Thus will
God keep us in dependance, for those liberal
Aids, and constant Supplies of his Grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which we cannot use the Grace that we
have.</p>
               <p>3. You must <hi>resist:</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 9. <hi>Whom resist
stedfast in the Faith.</hi> James 4. 7. <hi>Resist the Devil,
and he will flee from you.</hi> Stand your Ground, and
then Satan falls.</p>
               <p>In all those Assaults, Satan hath only Weapons
<hi>Offensive,</hi> as fiery Darts; none <hi>Defensive.</hi> We
have not only the <hi>Sword</hi> of the Spirit, which is
an <hi>Offensive</hi> Weapon, but the <hi>Shield</hi> of Faith,
that's a Defensive piece of Armour. Therefore
your Safety lieth in resisting.</p>
               <p>Now this Resistance must be,
<list>
                     <item>(1.) Not faint and cold, but strong and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement.</item>
                     <item>(2.) Thorow and total.</item>
                     <item>(3.) Constant and perpetual.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) Not <hi>faint</hi> and <hi>cold.</hi> Some kind of Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
may be made by general and common
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:47528:234"/>
Grace. The Light of Nature will rise up in
defiance of many Sins, especially at first: but this
must be earnest and vehement, it is against the
Enemies of your Soul. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Resistance was with
serious Dislikes and deep Groans, Rom. 7. 15. 24.
<hi>The Evil that I hate.</hi> And, <hi>O wretched Man, how shall
I be delivered?</hi> In most cases, a detestation or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
denial is enough. When the Devil
tempts Christ to worship him, Mat. 4. 10. <hi>Get thee
behind me Satan.</hi> In other Cases there must be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Disputes, and Repulses. When <hi>Eve</hi> speaks
faintly and coldly, the Devil renews his Assaults
with more violence. Gen. 3. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Hath God
said, ye shall not eat of every Tree of the Garden?
And the Woman said unto the Serpent, We may eat of
the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden: But of the
Fruit of the Tree, which is in the midst of the Garden,
God hath said, ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye
touch it, lest ye dye.</hi> She speaks there warmly,
and with too impatient a Resentment of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint:
and too cold in the Commination and
Threatning. Therefore the Devil works upon
her, when he saw she amplisieth the Restraint,
for she saith more indeed, <hi>We must neither eat nor
touch it.</hi> A faint Denial is a kind of Grant,
and therefore your repulse to Satan must be vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and strong: In many Cases slight Satan, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
with Indignation; as tho a Dog barks, yet
the Traveller goes by: Satan cannot endure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
At other times argue for God strongly.
Now the great Argument, that quickens you to
this lively and vehement Resistance; is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
thy Soul is in Danger, and all thy Eternal
Concernments. So some expound that, Eph. 6.
12. <hi>We fight not against Flesh and Blood, but against
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:47528:234"/>
Spiritual Wickedness in high places;</hi> in <hi>Heavenly</hi>
places it is in the Original: No Worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
must go so near, as that which concerns
the eternal Good and Salvation of your Souls.
What would the Devil have from thee, but thy
Soul, and thy precious Enjoyments, thy Peace of
Conscience, Communion with God, thy hopes of
Eternal Life? And when Satan comes, and bids
nothing but Worldly Vanities, we should repel
them with Indignation. A Merchant that hath a
precious Commodity, and a Chapman bids him a
base price, he puts up his Wares with Indignation,
and will not so much as regard him, or hear him:
So when the Devil comes, and would cheat you
of your precious Enjoyments, you should repel
him with Indignation, when there's such base and
unworthy Trifles to come in competition with
your great Hopes: As Christ, Mat. 16. 26. <hi>What
is a Man profited, if he shall gain the whole World,
and lose his Soul? or what shall a Man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for his Soul?</hi> What, shall I lose my Soul,
my Hopes, and Happiness, and all for such pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
things, for a little Temporal Advantage?</p>
               <p>(2.) It must be a <hi>thorow</hi> and <hi>total</hi> Resistance:
When you yield, the Devil incroacheth upon you.
We are bid (in the <hi>Canticles)</hi> to take the little
Foxes; to dash <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Brats in pieces: we
should not yield to Satan a little. The Devil at
first cannot hope to prevail for greater things,
therefore he seems more modest in his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Ay, but lesser Sticks set the greater on Fire;
when ye entertain lesser Temptations, this kindles
in your Souls, and it is easily blown up into a
great Flame in your Conscience. At first, when
the Devil came to our first Parents, <hi>Hath God said?</hi>
                  <pb n="454" facs="tcp:47528:235"/>
And then, <hi>You shall not surely dye. Hath God said
you shall not eat of the Fruit of the Garden?</hi> The first
Temptation was more modest. The Approaches
of Satan to the Soul are gradual, he asks but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
Ay, but it's a great matter if we grant it.
Consider, the Evil of Temptation is better <hi>kept</hi>
out, than <hi>got</hi> out. The Stone on the top of the
Hill, when it begins to roul downward, it is a hard
thing to stay it, we cannot say how far it will go.
Saith the deceived Heart, I will yield but little, and
never yield again; the Devil will carry thee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and further, until he hath left no tenderness in
thy Conscience. As many that thought to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
but a Shilling or two, yet by the secret
witchery of Gaming they play away their Estate,
Clothes and all: So many that think they will sin
but little at first, at last sin away all Principles of
Conscience, and Profession of Godliness.</p>
               <p>(3.) It must not be temporary for a <hi>while,</hi> but
<hi>perpetual.</hi> It concerns us not only to stand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the first Assault of Satan; but a long Siege:
Satan, what he cannot gain by Argument, seeks to
procure by Importunity. But <hi>resist him,</hi> saith the
Apostle, <hi>stedfastly, in the Faith, 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 9. As his
Instrument spake to <hi>Ioseph, from day to day,</hi> she
ceased not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 10. Deformed Objects, when
accustomed to them, seem not so odious; so the
Devil hopes to prevail at last; at least Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will not seem so odious: But you must keep
your Zeal to the last, as we rate away an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Beggar, that will not be answered: To
yield at last is to loose the Glory of the Conflict.
Grace must not only have its <hi>work,</hi> but its <hi>perfect</hi>
work, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 4. So let all our Graces, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Godlines<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and Brotherly-Kindness, have
their perfect work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:47528:235"/>
4. There is required <hi>Watchfulness.</hi> 1 Pet, 5. 8.
<hi>Be sober, be vigilant.</hi> You that are not ignorant of
Satan's Devices should watch, that you give not
him an advantage, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. nor an occasion,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 12. lest Satan tempt you; nor a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13. to the Flesh. Certainly, he
that would not be foiled, needs a great deal of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Moderation, and constant Jealousy over his
Heart; he had need to guard his <hi>Senses,</hi> Psal. 119.
37. <hi>Turn away mine Eyes from beholding Vanity;</hi> and
to look to his <hi>Company,</hi> Psal. 119. 115. <hi>Depart from
me, ye evil Doers; for I will keep the Commandments
of my God.</hi> And to avoid all <hi>Occasions</hi> of Sin, not
rush into them, but keep out of the way; Prov. 4.
14. <hi>Enter not into the Path of the Wicked, and go not
in the way of evil Men;</hi> for this is to ride into the
Devil's Quarters, to run into the Mouth of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Heretofore these were wholsome Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and why should they not be so now? The
Devil is not less subtile, or Sin less odious and
dangerous, only we are more Fool-hardy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
stand not at such a distance as we should from
Occasions. It is easier to avoid the Occasion, than
the Sin when Occasion is offered; as it is easier
for a Bird to fly from the Snare, than when intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
to avoid Danger. Therefore when you run
into harm's-way, you tempt Satan to tempt; and
when you look not to your selves, it is just with
God to let you fall into the Snare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are <hi>special</hi> times of Temptation,
when Christians should look to themselves. There's
an <hi>Evil-day,</hi> Eph. 6. 13. <hi>That ye may be able to stand
in the Evil-day:</hi> And there's an <hi>Hour</hi> of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the World, Rev. 3. 10. <hi>I will keep thee
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:47528:236"/>
from the Hour of Temptation whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h shall come upon all
the World.</hi> There are certain times when God is
proving what Men will do, and when the Devil
is likely to make a great advantage of our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
and Afflictions, when things fall cross to
our Desires, and we know not what Evil waits
for us; how should we do to behave our selves?</p>
               <p>1. Be not over-<hi>confident,</hi> or over-<hi>diffident.</hi> Not
over-<hi>confident,</hi> in running beyond the bounds of our
Calling, to cast our selves into Dangers and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of Temptation: Nor over-<hi>diffid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt,</hi> by base
flying from, or giving way when God calls for
valiant Resistance. Both ways is the Devil likely
to assault us; either by making us fool-hardy. So
Satan seeks to drive us beyond the bounds of our
Calling, to put us out of our Place, that we may be
a Prey to him: As Men use to trouble the Water,
that they may rouse the Fish, and draw them into
the Snare, and drive them out of places of Safety
where they rest; so the Devil seeks to put us out
of our Safety. <hi>Peter</hi> would needs come to Christ,
Mat. 14. 28. <hi>Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto
thee on the Water;</hi> and we see he sinks before he
could accomplish his Purpose: So when we are
over-confident, and run out of our Calling upon
Hazards, then we are ever and anon ready to
sink. But we should not turn back when God
calls us to a valiant Resistance. <hi>Should such a Man
as I flee?</hi> Neh. 6. 11. Observe <hi>Peter</hi>'s dastardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
when he ventures without a Call into the
Priests-Hall; a Question of the Damsels over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
him. He that was so <hi>Cowardly</hi> when he was
out of his Way, look upon his <hi>Boldness</hi> when he
was in his Work, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 7. unto <hi>vers. 13. When
they saw the boldness of</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>they marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:47528:236"/>
Iohn</hi> was the Disciple of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>
was the <hi>Fearful</hi> Disciple; yet how full of
Boldness, Courage, and Zeal when they were
called and singled out to give proof of the reality
of God's Grace! And therefore we should never
be over-forward, nor over-backward, but own
God in his Truth when we are in our Calling.
Let not Satan bring you out of your Place, to cast
your selves as a prey to him.</p>
               <p>2. In an Hour of Temptation, we should be
more solicitous about <hi>Duties</hi> than <hi>Events;</hi> and
about <hi>Sins</hi> than <hi>Dangers.</hi> As to <hi>Events;</hi> God is
concerned as well as you, and he will order them
for his own Glory. It should be your great care,
that you may be kept blameless to his Heavenly
Kingdom: 2 Tim. 4. 17, 18. <hi>The Lord that hath
delivered me out of the Mouth of the Lion, shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
me from every evil Work, and will preserve
me unto his Heavenly Kingdom.</hi> However God
deal with you as to Events, and whatever Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
attend you, this should be your care mainly,
that you may not sin, but be kept blameless.
<hi>David</hi> often begged direction, that he might be
guided in his trouble, and not faulter, and do
any thing unseemly.</p>
               <p>3. Be more jealous of Satan's <hi>Wiles,</hi> than of
his open <hi>Assaults.</hi> Natural Courage, and the
bravery of a common and ordinary Resolution,
together with deep engagement of Credit and
Interest, may do much to make us stand out
against Assaults, against open Force and Violence
of Evil Men; but there needs a great deal of
Judgment, to stand out against the Wiles and
Crafts of the Devil. Flesh and Blood will not
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:47528:237"/>
so easily bear us out against the secret Insnarings
of the Heart. The young Prophet doth thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
out his Message against the King, 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
13. 3. yet was enticed by the Wiles of the old
Prophet. So we may stand out against an open
Assault, and apparent Violence, but take heed
of the secret Wiles of Satan.</p>
               <p>4. The Wiles of Satan, are to inforce and draw
us into those Corruptions which are incident to
the Season. Here's the great Point of Spiritual
Wisdom, to be seasoned in our Mortification, and
to withstand the Spiritual Evil that is apt to grow
upon us in the time of our Fears; Psalm 56. 3.
<hi>What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.</hi> Then
our great Business is, to cherish our dependance
upon God, to prevent distrust and unbelieving
Thoughts of God's Providence. As (on the
other side) in a Time when we are likely to be
corrupted with ease and prosperity, then our
Business is, to watch against security and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Heart, which is apt to grow upon us.
As <hi>Nazianzen</hi> said, When things go prosperous
with me, I read the <hi>Lamentations</hi> of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> I
remember the mournful Passages which befal the
People of God, and that's my Cure. So to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
despondency in a time of Fears, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
our Souls to dependance.</p>
               <p>Now when our Wills are crossed, Dangers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
us on every side, and we know not how far
Evil will break out to the overturning of all.
What are the Sins incident to such a time of
trouble? and how do the Wiles of Satan come
upon us?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="459" facs="tcp:47528:237"/>
1. Impatience. <hi>Gen. 30. 1. when the Will of</hi>
Rachel <hi>was crossed, she said unto</hi> Iacob, Give me
Children, or else I die. <hi>When we impatiently fret
against the Lord,</hi> Psalm 37. 1. Fret not thy self
because of evil Doers; neither be thou envious against
the workers of Iniquity.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Murmuring</hi> and repining against the Lord,
that's another Snare. Jonah 4. 9. <hi>I do well to be
angry, even unto Death;</hi> when he was crossed.
Discontent at God's Providence, gratifieth Satan
exceedingly; when we will justify our selves,
and think it a kind of Zeal to be angry, and pett
against Providence.</p>
               <p>3. A Spirit of <hi>Revenge</hi> against <hi>Instruments;</hi>
when we do not sweetly calm the Heart with the
remembrance of God's Hand. 2 Sam. 16. 9.
<hi>Why should this dead Dog curse my Lord the King?
Let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his Head.</hi>
Thus when wicked Men disturb Order, the Heart
is apt to rise in revenge, therefore we are to
calm our Hearts.</p>
               <p>4. There's <hi>fainting</hi> in Duty; when we begin
to give over Prayer, and are discouraged, and
are loth to wrestle with God in an Ordinance.
Heb. 12. 12. <hi>Lift up the Hands which hang down,
and the feeble Knees.</hi> When a Man's Hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to wax feeble, and he is discouraged in the
Ways of the Lord; <hi>My Foot had well-nigh slipt,
saith</hi> David, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 2.</p>
               <p>5. There's closing with <hi>sinful means,</hi> and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to them for an escape: As <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was
crossed, 1 <hi>Sam. 28. 7. Seek me a Woman that hath
a Familiar Spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire
of her.</hi> When we go to carnal Shifts, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:47528:238"/>
Means, these are very natural to us.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Despair,</hi> and distrustful Thoughts of God,
though we have had much experience of his
Goodness. <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 27. 1. <hi>I shall now pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
one day by the hand of</hi> Saul; after all his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Questioning</hi> our <hi>Interest</hi> in God, by reason
of Crosses, or the doubtful posture of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs:
Judges 6. 13. <hi>If the Lord be with us, why
then is all this befallen us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the Wiles of Satan. Ride out the
Storm upon Gospel-Encouragements. This will
bear us up, it is but a moment to Eternity; <hi>It is
but a light Affliction, and will work for us a far
more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory,</hi> 2 Cor.
4. 17.</p>
               <p>The second Point is this;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That if we would not be overcome by
the Evil of Temptations, we should earnestly
deal with God about them.</p>
               <p>For so doth our Lord direct us here, <hi>(Lead us
not into Temptation)</hi> to come to God himself.</p>
               <p>There are two Reasons I shall consider of in
this Discourse.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>First,</hi> We cannot be tempted without the
<hi>Will</hi> of God.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nor resist without the <hi>Power</hi> of
God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:47528:238"/>
Therefore we should deal with God earnestly
in all our Temptations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We cannot be tempted without the <hi>Will</hi>
of God. That God hath a Providence in and
about Temptations, is clear from the Scripture.
<hi>Mat. 4. 1. Then was Iesus led up of the Spirit into
the Wilderness, to be tempted of the Devil.</hi> The
Holy Spirit had a hand in it, as well as the Evil
Spirit. So, 2 <hi>Sam. 24. 1. God moved</hi> David <hi>to
number</hi> Israel <hi>and</hi> Judah. But in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1.
it is said, <hi>And Satan stood up against</hi> Israel, <hi>and
provoked</hi> David <hi>to number</hi> Israel. Satan, he cannot
tempt without leave from God. As a Lion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stir out of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ge, until the Keeper brings
him out; so the Devil, this roaring Lion, is held
by the irresistible Chains of God's Providence,
and cannot stir until God brings him out.</p>
               <p>Consider two things:</p>
               <p>1. To be <hi>led</hi> into Temptation, is more than
simply to be <hi>tempted.</hi> God's <hi>permitting</hi> us to be
tempted, is not so much as God's <hi>leading</hi> us into
Temptation; for these are two distinct Phrases.
God may permit or suffer us to be tempted, as a
<hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Soveraign,</hi> which hath power over his
own Creature, for the trial and exercise of
Grace, and can absolutely dispose of it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own Will; but he leads us into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as a <hi>Iudg.</hi> And therefore this is one of the
Comforts which <hi>Iob</hi> propounds to himself, when
Satan had a liberty to molest him, <hi>Iob 9. 12. He
taketh away, who can hinder him? who shall say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, What dost thou?</hi> The General of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
may, according to his discretion, lead which
Band he pleaseth, and set them in the Forlorn-Hope,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:47528:239"/>
in a place of the greatest Danger, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
for Reserves which part of the Army he
pleaseth: So God may single out his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
to Combat for his Glory, and may leave
others in a more quiet Posture, according as he
pleaseth. Thus, as a Soveraign Agent, God may
suffer to be tempted. But now, to lead into
Temptation, that's another thing, and implieth
something of Punishment; or as it is expressed,
<hi>Mat. 26. 41. Pray that ye enter not into Temptation:</hi>
We <hi>enter</hi> into it by our own voluntary motion,
as having forfeited his Protection. But then God
leads us in as a <hi>Iudg,</hi> puts the Malefactor into
the Executioners or Officers hands: so doth God
lead us into Temptation; it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> judicial Act, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when left to perish under the weight of a
Temptation.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Consider;</hi> God as a Judg, he may lead us
into Temptation two ways: either he may act
in way of Correction, to manifect his fatherly
Indignation; or by way of strict Punishment.
And so in respect of his fatherly Correction,
God may give us up to a <hi>vexing,</hi> or to an <hi>insnaring</hi>
Temptation. He may lead the <hi>Godly</hi> into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that they may be <hi>molested</hi> and <hi>troubled;</hi> and
may lead the <hi>Wicked</hi> into Temptation, that they
may be <hi>seduced</hi> and led away for their <hi>eternal</hi>
Ruin. There's a <hi>vexing</hi> Temptation God useth
for the Correction of his own Children; and
thus <hi>Paul</hi> was buffeted by Satan, lest he should be
exalted above measure, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
sets his Dog upon the stray'd Sheep, not to
worry him, but to lodg him, and bring him back
again into the Fold: so doth God suffer his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to be buffeted and exercised by Satan, to
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:47528:239"/>
their great trouble, but for their good in the
issue; for he knoweth how to turn all these
things for good. Then there is an <hi>insnaring</hi>
Temptation, by which the Wicked are intangled
in a way of Sin; and so Satan, as God's Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
is said sometimes to <hi>blind</hi> the <hi>Eyes</hi> of
Wicked Men, lest the Light of the Glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of Christ should shine unto them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4.
and sometimes to <hi>harden</hi> their <hi>Hearts,</hi> John 12.
40. <hi>lest they should be converted and healed;</hi> for
the punishment of former Sins, God may give
up the Wicked to be blinded and hardned by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
to their own destruction; which is one of the
most dreadful Acts of God, as a Judg, on this
side Hell.</p>
               <p>Certainly then when we are tempted, we have
great cause to deal with God about the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for he hath a hand; either he may <hi>suffer</hi>
us to be tempted, as Lord and Soveraign; or
may <hi>lead</hi> us into Temptation, either in a way of
fatherly <hi>Correction,</hi> or as a meer <hi>Punishment,</hi> that
we may more ruin and destroy our selves.</p>
               <p>I come now to the second Reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God alone can give strength to resist
and overcome the Temptation; and therefore
we should deal with him very earnestly about it;
Rom. 16. 20. <hi>The God of Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall bruise Satan
under your feet shortly.</hi> It is <hi>God</hi> that treads
down Satan, but under <hi>your feet.</hi> We <hi>fight</hi> it
out, but the <hi>Author of the Victory</hi> is the <hi>God</hi> of
Peace We are interested in it, (for we trample
upon Satan with our own feet) but <hi>God</hi>'s is the
<hi>Grace.</hi> Our <hi>Faculties</hi> are not only exercised, but
our <hi>Graces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:47528:240"/>
Briefly, two ways doth God concur with the
Saints in resisting Temptations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> God plants all those Graces in their
Hearts, that are necessary to the Conflict. To speak
of those three Essential Graces, <hi>Faith, Fear,</hi> and
<hi>Love;</hi> these are all necessary for the resistance
of a Temptation. That Faith is necessary,
1 <hi>Pet. 5. 9. Whom resist stedfast in the Faith.</hi> And
<hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> that they also are necessary, I
shall prove thus: Satan's Weapons against us,
and his way of assaulting, are either subtil <hi>Wiles,</hi>
or fiery <hi>Darts; That ye may be able to stand against
the Wiles of the Devil, and quench all the fiery
Darts of the Wicked,</hi> Ephes. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1, 16. As he assaults
us by <hi>fiery Darts,</hi> by raging and boisterous
Temptations, take the Shield of <hi>Faith,</hi> cover all
with the Righteousness of Christ, and with a
sense of your Privileges by Christ, and that's it
which maintains the Heart, and keeps it against
the fiery Darts of the Devil. But as he assaults
us by his <hi>Wiles,</hi> there <hi>Fear,</hi> and the <hi>Love</hi> of
God comes in, and is necessary for us. For there
are two sorts of Wiles that Satan useth for the
destroying of our Souls; One is, to convey the
Temptation by such means as are most taking
with the Person tempted: and the other is, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guising
and turning himself into an Angel of
Light, colouring the Temptation.</p>
               <p>For the first, Namely, as he suiteth every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
of our Souls with a proper Diet or Food,
or tempts us by such means as are likely to prevail.
As if a Man were tempted by sensual Delight,
there the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is necessary; Why? for
nothing but the Love of God will make us deny
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:47528:240"/>
that which is so near and pleasing to us, or that
Affection which grows upon the apprehension of
his Grace in Christ, therefore the Grace of God is
said to teach us to deny all Ungodliness and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Lusts, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>2. For the other Wile. As Satan doth trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himself into an Angel of Light, and cover
his base Designs with plausible Pretences; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<hi>Revenge</hi> shall be accounted <hi>Zeal:</hi> He will
difguise it so, as that the very Apostles shall count
it Zeal for the Glory of God, when they called
for Fire from Heaven to consume them, even as
<hi>Elias</hi> did. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 54. And <hi>Carnal Counsel</hi> shall
be counted <hi>Pitty</hi> and <hi>Natural Affection.</hi> Mat. 16.
22. Peter <hi>took him, and began to rebuke him, saying,
Be it far from thee, Lord: This shall not be unto thee.</hi>
He shall be the Devil's Agent to tempt Christ, and
his Carnal Counsel shall be looked upon as Pity to
his Master. And <hi>Licentiousness</hi> shall be <hi>Christian
Liberty,</hi> and our Liberty by Christ shall be used a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an occasion to the Flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13. And an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
use of <hi>Carnal Pleasure</hi> shall be <hi>Christian
Rejoicing,</hi> or Christian Chearfulness. Therefore
as there needs <hi>Love</hi> to withstand the Potency of
Temptation, by the suitableness of the Bait to
our own Affections; so there needs the <hi>Fear</hi> of
God, Prov. 14. 27. <hi>The Fear of the Lord is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Life, to depart from the Snares of Death.</hi>
When the Devil, by his Wiles, is laying Snares
for us, Snares of Death, the Fear of the Lord is a
Fountain of Life. A Man that is afraid to offend
God, and to abuse his Liberty, or run into any
Excess, under colour of a Grace, is very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and watchful, and thereby is not so soon
surprized. Thus, when the Soul is inflamed by
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:47528:241"/>
the vehement heat of boyling Lusts, or raging
Despair, Faith is necessary. Luke 22. 31, 32. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as
Wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail
not.</hi> Faith laying hold upon Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and waiting for his Grace, teaches us to
overcome in such Conflicts.</p>
               <p>But why should I instance in these three Graces
only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when we are bidden to <hi>put on the whole
Armour of God?</hi> Eph. 6. 11, 13. If we would
come off with Honour in this Conflict, we must be
<hi>compleatly</hi> armed; no Power of the Soul, or Sense
of the Body must be left naked, and without a
Guard, therefore not one saving Grace can be
wanting.</p>
               <p>A Christian is set forth as armed from
Head to Foot. There's for the Head a Helmet
of Salvation, which is Hope; a Breast-Plate of
Righteousness; the Girdle of Truth; for Shoes;
the Gospel of Peace; the Shield of Faith; the
Sword of the Spirit. These are the Graces neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to resist Temptation, and these we have from
God. A Christian hath not only Weapons <hi>Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,</hi>
but <hi>Defensive;</hi> not only a <hi>Sword,</hi> but also a
<hi>Shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld:</hi> Satan hath only Weapons Offensive, as
Darts, he hath Darts to wound the Soul. Again,
observe, there is no piece of Armour for the
<hi>Back;</hi> why? Because there is no Flight in this
Spiritual Warfare, we must stand to it, Jam. 4. 7.
<hi>Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us see what are the pieces of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Armour? The Apostle begins with the Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of <hi>Truth,</hi> by which is meant not Truth of
Doctrine (for that's the Sword of the Spirit)
but Sincerity, or an honest Intention; when a
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:47528:241"/>
Man endeavoureth to be both to God and Man,
what he seems to be; now it's the Lord that must
renew the right Spirit within us. Satan he assaults
us with Wiles, but our Armour of Proof against
him is the Girdle of Truth. We stand against
the Wiles of Satan, but we must not fight against
him with his own Weapons, and put off Wiles
with Wiles; Sincerity and honest Intention, that's
our Strength: this is a Girdle to the Loins, it
gives Strength and Courage to the Soul. And
then there's the <hi>Breast-Plate</hi> of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> or
that Grace which puts us upon a holy Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
suitable to God's Will revealed in his Word;
whereby we endeavour to give God and Man
their due; it secures the Breast, and Vital Parts,
the Seed of inherent Grace in the Heart, an honest
fixed purpose to obey God in all things. The
next thing, the <hi>Feet</hi> must be <hi>shod;</hi> we shall meet
with rough Ways in our Passage to Heaven, and
what's that which is Armour of Proof for our
Feet? <hi>The Preparation of the Gospel of Peace,</hi> a
Sense of our Peace and Friendship made up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and us through Christ; without this
we shall never follow God in the way of Duty,
when we meet with Difficulties and Hardships.
But above all, take the <hi>Shield of Faith;</hi> a Shield
covers the Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that which gives Defence to
all is <hi>Faith;</hi> without this a Man is naked; desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Christ's imputed Righteousness, he wants
his Covenant-Strength; it applyeth Christ's
Righteousness, and engageth the Power of God
on our behalf. Then there's the <hi>Helmet</hi> of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which is <hi>Hope, 1 Thess.</hi> 5. 8. A well-grounded
hope of Salvation, it makes us hold up the Head
in the midst of all Waves and sore Assaults, that
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:47528:242"/>
is, it is our great <hi>Motive</hi> and Encouragement in
the work of Sanctification. Then there's the
<hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is both Offensive and
Defensive; it wardeth off Satan's Blows, and
makes him fly black from us as one wounded and
ashamed. These are the Graces; now God gives
them to us, and therefore he is called, <hi>The God of
all Grace,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 10. Why? because he requires
it only? No, but because he giveth it also: And
it is called <hi>The Armour of God,</hi> vers. 11. God is
the Author, God is the Maker, God is the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this Armour; and he doth freely bestow it
upon us. The Apostle bids us, <hi>Take the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of God,</hi> vers. 13. that is, take it out of God's
Hand; this Armour is not of our making and
procuring, but made to our Hands by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He actuates these Graces by putting
good Motions into our Hearts, or sweet and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Thoughts, whereby all the fore-mentioned
Graces are drawn out. When we are conflicting
with Sin in an Hour of Temptation, Faith is set
a-work; <hi>That God may fulfil all the good pleasure of
his Goodness, and the work of Faith with power,</hi>
2 Thess. 1. 11. that is, by a Divine Power and
Influence quickning it into Acts. <hi>Ioseph,</hi> when he
was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a gracious Motion and thought put into his Mind,
<hi>How can I do this Wickedness, and sin against God?</hi>
Gen. 39. 9. Still there is a seasonable remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of things by the Spirit, whose office it is to
bring all things to remembrance, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 26. The
Spirit doth not only teach us all things, but
brings thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to our remembrance, when we have
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:47528:242"/>
need of any Truth to be set home upon the Heart;
either such a Truth as forbids the Evil to which
we are tempted; or that speaketh Comfort and
Encouragement to us under such a Cross; or
pressing such a Duty as we hang off from. The sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
remembrance of Truths, is the great actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
help which we have from God. Jesus Christ
himself, by seasonable urging the Scripture, defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Temptation wherewith he was assaulted,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10, 11. The Word quickneth in Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 50. Some proper Comfort is born
in upon the Soul by the Power of God. It is not
the bare remembrance of Truth, but the secret
Power of God which enliveneth it, and makes it
effectual in its season to defeat the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> It directs you what to do in Temptations,
to go to God for Help and Strength against them.
Briefly, when you treat with God, it should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a threefold Notion.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As the Author and Giver of Grace.</item>
                  <item>2. As the Sovereign Giver and Disposer of it,
according to his own Will.</item>
                  <item>3. As a Judg, by Temptation, correcting some
foregoing Sin by the present Temptation.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. <hi>Treat with God as the</hi> Author <hi>and</hi> Giver <hi>of
Grace. Jam.</hi> 1. 17. He is the Father of Lights, from
whom every good and perfect Gift cometh
down. <hi>And so,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) We ought to come to him as renouncing
our Strength, and waiting for his Grace as able
to help us. That Address <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> made in a
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:47528:243"/>
                  <hi>Temporal</hi> Case, is good also in a <hi>Spiritual,</hi> 2 Chron.
20. 12. <hi>Lord, we have no might, our Eyes are unto
thee.</hi> There is a renouncing of their own
Strength, and a dependance upon God. There
must be a renouncing of all <hi>Self-dependance,</hi> for
<hi>God gives Grace to the Humble,</hi> Jam. 4. 6. The
word <hi>Humble,</hi> is to be understood not <hi>Morally,</hi> to
those that are of a lowly carriage towards Men of
a meek Spirit; but it is understood <hi>Spiritually,</hi> of
those that in the brokenness of their Hearts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
their own Nothingness and Weakness;
to these he gives Grace. God withholdeth and
withdraweth his Influences, when we do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
the daily and hourly necessity of Grace,
when we do not desire it with such vehemency as
we were wont, nor receive it with such Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and Rejoicing. In these three last Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Lord's Prayer; <hi>Give us this day our daily
Bread</hi> then, <hi>Forgive us our Trespasses;</hi> then, <hi>Lead
us not into Temptation:</hi> we beg daily <hi>Bread,</hi> daily
<hi>Pardon,</hi> daily <hi>Strength.</hi> We can neither live
without the one nor the other; we cannot <hi>live</hi>
without daily <hi>Bread,</hi> nor live <hi>comfortably</hi> without
daily <hi>Pardon,</hi> nor live <hi>holily</hi> without daily <hi>Grace.</hi>
And therefore you are <hi>to wait upon God all the Day,</hi>
Psal. 25. 5. And Psal. 16. 8. <hi>I have set the Lord
always before me.</hi> Now, we may be said to set the
Lord before us, either in point of <hi>Reverence,</hi> when
we are sensible of his Eye and Presence; or in
point of <hi>Dependance,</hi> when we are still waiting for
his Strength; and that's the meaning there, <hi>He
is at my right Hand, I shall not be moved.</hi> Look,
as a Glass without a foot falls to the Ground,
and is broken as soon as 'tis set out of Hand; such
a sensible Christian apprehends himself to be, if
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:47528:243"/>
he be out of the Hands of God, he is broken, and
falls to pieces. Therefore in this Sense he goes to
God, and desires him to keep him from Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Dependance begets Observance. If the
Creature could once but live of himself, tho it
were but for a while, God would seldom hear
from him. This is that which is the Bridle upon
the new-Creature, to keep up his constant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with God.</p>
               <p>(2.) We must go to him with <hi>Confidence,</hi> in an
actual dependance upon the All-sufficiency of his
Grace. It is not enough to apprehend our <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
but we must also go forth in the <hi>Strength</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> that is, hold up our Hearts with a Sense of
this, that God is able to bear us up, and defeat all
our Spiritual Enemies. God would not take off
the Temptation from <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 9. but saith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>My Grace is sufficient for thee;</hi> He can either <hi>weaken.</hi>
Temptation, or give in further <hi>supply</hi> of Strength:
Therefore encourage your selves in the power of
the Lord. The Devil cannot tempt us one jot
further than the Lord will permit him, his Malice
is limited and restrained; if you be in Satan's
Hands, Satan is in God's Hands, and can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without his leave and permission; he begs
leave to enter into the Herd of Swine, much less
can he enter into the Sheep of his Pasture.</p>
               <p>2. Look upon God not only as the Giver of
Grace, but as the <hi>Soveraign Giver</hi> and <hi>Disposer</hi> of
it according to his own Will, Phil. 2. 13. <hi>It is God
that worketh in you both to will and to do of his
good Pleasure.</hi> His giving of Grace is altogether
free, as what measure of Assistance we shall have,
and by what means it shall be supplied. God may
enlarge or abate the degree of his Influence, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:47528:244"/>
to his own Will. Now, thus we must come
to him, with Submission to his good Pleasure, either
for taking off the Temptation, or continuing it
for your Exercise, or the measure of your Supply.
When you murmur and fret, it's sign you have
too good Thoughts of your selves; when we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to God, it argues some ascribing to our
selves. You are to endeavour (indeed) to pray,
and use all good means to come out of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but submit, if the Lord be pleased to continue
his Exercise upon you. Nay, tho God should
continue the Temptation, and for the present not
give out those measures of Grace necessary for
you, yet you must not murmur, but lie at his
Feet; for God is Lord of his own Grace.</p>
               <p>3. You are to look upon God as a <hi>Iudg,</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
some foregoing Sin by your present
Temptation. And therefore,</p>
               <p>(1.) You must <hi>humble</hi> your selves under his mighty
Hand (when you are exercised with great and
sore Temptations) and accept the Punishment of
your Iniquity, without murmuring; that's the
only way to get it off, when you own it as the
Fruit of Sin. Lev. 26. 41. <hi>If then their uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of their Iniquity.</hi> And Mic. 7. 9. <hi>I will bear
the Indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him.</hi> Acknowledg the Justice of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in this trouble that is brought upon you.
A Christian must not only look to the <hi>Malice</hi> of
<hi>Satan</hi> in his Temptations, but to the <hi>Iustice</hi> of
<hi>God.</hi> Look, as in <hi>outward</hi> Affli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tions, we are not
to reflect upon Instruments; <hi>Iob</hi> did not say, <hi>The
Caldean and Sabean hath taken,</hi> but, <hi>The Lord hath
taken,</hi> chap. 1. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. So in these <hi>Spiritual</hi> Afflictions,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:47528:244"/>
take the Temptation out of God's Hand, as a
Judg. Tho Satan pursue you with fiery Darts,
with Temptations horrible and terrible, yet look
upon it as the Fruit of some foregoing Sin. If he
should tempt you by injection of despairing Fears,
or blasphemous Thoughts, these are not <hi>your Sins,</hi>
but they may be a <hi>Punishment</hi> for your Sins; so
you ought to humble your selves under the mighty
Hand of God. When you are vexed with such
Temptations as <hi>pierce and prick you in your Veins;</hi>
(as <hi>David</hi> speaks) when the Devil bears in blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Thoughts upon the Heart, they are his
Sins, but your Corrections, justly ordered by God;
it may be it is for the Correction of your Sin, that
you have provoked God to afflict you thus; and
this Rod, if it smart, it was dipt in your own
Guilt: and it's a Fruit of God's Fatherly Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
for your Folly and Vanity: For God may
thus manifest it, by giving thee up to this severe
Discipline, to be tempted and vexed by Satan.
Now 'tis your Duty to be sensible of your Sin, and
say, as <hi>Sion</hi> in her Troubles, Lam. 1. 18. <hi>The Lord
is righteous, for I have rebelled against his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) Find out and remove the Cause of Sin,
when God lets loose Satan upon us. <hi>Paul</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
it presently (as usually God's Rod brings
Light along with it) when he was buffeted with
a Messenger of Satan, it was <hi>that he might not be
ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lted above measure,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 7. Now that
which hath provoked God to exercise us with this
Discipline, that may be known sometimes by the
<hi>Time</hi> when this Temptation surprizeth us, if it
trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon the Heels of some immediate and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Provocation; that's the Sin you should
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:47528:245"/>
humble your selves for. Or by that ill Frame and
Posture of Spirit wherein the Temptation found
you, as <hi>Paul</hi>'s Heart was likely puffed up and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
with his Spiritual Enjoyments, therefore
God lets loose Satan. Sometimes by the nature of
the Temptation it self; for God suits Punishments
to Sins, and apt and proper Remedies to every
Disease. Or else, the Sin will be cast up by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Conscience in a way of Remorse; as in a
Tempest, that which is at bottom comes on top.
Or God will discover it by his Spirit, when you
go and seek to him. When Temptation is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and sore, go to God and say, Lord, why
is it thus with me? Job 34. 31, 32. <hi>Surely it is
meet to be said unto God, I have born chastisement, I
will not offend any more. That which I see not, teach
thou me; if I have done Iniquity, I will do no more.</hi>
Pray for a discovery of your secret Sin, and what
is the Mind of God in the Dispensation. Now
when you have found out the cause of the Sin,
this is the Direction, to remove the Cause; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
we let the Sin go, God will continue the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
tho we strive, pray, and ask Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
our burden will still be continued upon us,
until Sin be mortified in us, tho in some measure
it be removed out of our Hearts.</p>

us to be tempted by the Devil; yet we desire that

and the Saints. And he is the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> Joh.
8. 44. As <hi>Iubal was the Father of all such as handle
the Harp and Organ,</hi> Gen. 4. 21. that is, he was
the first that taught the use of that Instrument:
So all the Sins in the World, are by his furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
both Actual, and Original; therefore he
may be fitly called the <hi>Evil One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, He hath a great stroke in Temptation,
that he is the Artificer, the Designer, the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of them; therefore he is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
the <hi>Tempter, Mat.</hi> 4. 3. Well then, <hi>Lead us
not into Temptation, but deliver us from the [Evil
One.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may render it Indefinitely, as we
do, <hi>Deliver us from Evil,</hi> that is, from <hi>Sin.</hi> And
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itly is this so called, because it is the greatest
Evil, above Poverty, Sickness, and Worldly
Loss. Every thing which doth harm us, that may
be called Evil; now Sin doth most hurt, nothing
so much as Sin; why? Because it doth endamage
our inward Man, and endanger our Everlasting
Hopes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="477" facs="tcp:47528:246"/>
1. It doth endammage our inward Man, and
hindreth and diminisheth our comfortable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God. Other things may harm the
<hi>Man,</hi> but they do not touch the <hi>Christian;</hi> and
therefore saith the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 16. For
which cause we faint not; but though our outward
Man perish, yet the inward Man is renewed day by
day.</hi> Breaches made upon the outward Man,
come not so near as a Breach made upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Man; therefore we faint not, so long as
the inward Man is safe.</p>
               <p>2. It doth endanger our everlasting Hopes
and Concernments, and therefore it is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Evil. All Afflictions do but reach our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
but Sin reacheth our Eternal Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and therefore the Apostle promiseth
himself this kind of Deliverance, as that which
was most worthy; 2 Tim. 4. 17, 18. <hi>I was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
out of the Mouth of the Lion. And the Lord
shall deliver me from every evil Work, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
me unto his Heavenly Kingdom.</hi> Well then,
you see it may be rendred the Evil <hi>One,</hi> or the
Evil <hi>Thing.</hi> The word carrieth it for Sin; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
denoteth the Evil of Afflictions, and <hi>malum poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi>
as well as <hi>malum culpae,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> never but
Evil of Fault. And we need not anxiously di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute,
whether the one or the other, for one
cannot be understood without respect to the
other. Therefore I shall take it in a general
sence; That Evil which results from Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whether they arise from Satan, the World,
or our own Hearts.</p>
               <p>From the words thus opened, the Points will
be two.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="478" facs="tcp:47528:247"/>
                  <item>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That while we are in this Valley of
Tears and Snares, we should with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness
and confidence, pray to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from Evil.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To be kept from the Evil of Sin,
is a greater Mercy, than to be kept from
the trouble of Temptation.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I observe the first Point, because Christ thus
directed us to pray to God. The second, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Evil of Sin is intended. For the
First; We should pray with earnestness, because
of our Danger; and with Confidence, because of
God's undertaking. The Lord Jesus knows what
Requests are most acceptable to his Father. Now
when he would give a perfect Pattern and Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of Prayer, he bids you pray thus; <hi>Deliver
us from Evil.</hi> Nay, we have not only Christ's
<hi>Direction,</hi> but Christ's <hi>Example;</hi> John 17. 15.
<hi>I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the
World, but that thou shouldst keep them from the
Evil.</hi> He did not absolutely pray for an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Temptation, though he knew the
World would be a tempestuous Place, that his
People must expect strong Assaults; (Lord, take
them not out of the World, but keep them
from the <hi>Evil)</hi> so here, <hi>Deliver us from Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We should pray with <hi>Earnestness,</hi> because
of our <hi>Danger,</hi> from the Enemies of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which are the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the
<hi>Flesh;</hi> In respect of all which, we pray to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from Evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:47528:247"/>
1. From the Evil which the <hi>Devil</hi> designs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us. Both bad and good Men have need
to make this Prayer: <hi>Bad</hi> Men have need; <hi>Good</hi>
Men will have a <hi>Heart</hi> certainly to pray thus to
God, if they consider their Danger.</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>unconverted</hi> Men, they are
under the Power of the <hi>Devil,</hi> if they were sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of it; for the Devils are said to be <hi>Rulers of
the Darkness of this World,</hi> Ephes. 6. 12. By
which is meant the Wicked, Ignorant, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
part of the World, whether they live in
Gentilism, or within the Pale and Line of Christ's
Communion, over all those that live in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed
state of Sin and Ignorance; over all
these, Satan hath an Empire and Dominion.
And mark, when God carried on his Kingdom in
in a way of sensible Manifestation, by <hi>Visions,
Oracles,</hi> and <hi>Miracles:</hi> So did Satan visibly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the Pagan World by <hi>Apparitions, Oracles,
lying Wonders,</hi> and sensible <hi>manifestations</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
But now, when God's Kingdom is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
<hi>The Kingdom of God is within you,</hi> Luke 17.
21. So by proportion, Satan's Kingdom is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
too, he rules in the Hearts of Men,
though they little think of it. All natural Men,
whether they be Pagans or Christians, though
outwardly and apparently they may renounce the
Devil's Kingdom, and do not seem to have such
open communion with him, as the Gentiles that
consult with his Oracl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, and were instructed by
his Apparitions, acted by his Power, and offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to him: But <hi>Spiritually,</hi> all natural Men are
under the Devil; for, 1 <hi>Io. 3. 8. He that committeth
Sin, is of the Devil;</hi> that is, he belongeth to him.
How is he of the Devil? They are his <hi>Children,</hi>
                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:47528:248"/>
Acts 13. 10. <hi>O thou Child of the Devil.</hi> And they
are his <hi>Subjects,</hi> he ruleth in them; he hath a
Kingdom among Men, which by all means he
goeth about to maintain; Mat. 12. 26. <hi>If Satan
be divided against himself, how then can his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
stand?</hi> And they are his Work-houses, he
worketh in them: <hi>Ephes. 2. 2. The Spirit that
worketh in the Children of Disobedience.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is hard at work in a wicked Man's Heart,
framing Evil Thoughts, Carnal Motions; urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to break God's Laws; drawing them on
to more Sin and Villany; fills their Hearts with
<hi>lying,</hi> and all manner of <hi>Sins;</hi> Acts 5. 3. <hi>Why hath
Satan filled thine Heart to lie to the Holy Ghost?</hi>
He binds them with <hi>Prejudices,</hi> and will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to hearken to the Glorious Gospel;
2 Cor. 4. 4. <hi>In whom the God of this World hath
blinded the Minds of them which believe not, lest the
Light of the Glorious Gospel of Christ should shine unto
them.</hi> He blinds and holds them <hi>captive</hi> at his Will
and Pleasure, their Souls are fettered, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26.
And sometimes he oppresses their <hi>Bodies,</hi> (for
Satan carrieth on his Kingdom by Force, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Fears, and Bondage); and therefore it is
said, <hi>Acts 10. 38. That Christ went about doing
good, and healing all that were oppressed of the Devil.</hi>
Yet further, as God's Executioner, he hath the
Power over <hi>Death,</hi> for their torment; Heb. 2. 14.
<hi>That through Death he might destroy him that had
the power of Death, that is, the Devil.</hi> And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the Lord be merciful, he never ceaseth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on wicked Men, until both they and he
are for ever in Hell; Mat. 25. 41. <hi>Depart from
me, ye cursed, into everlasting Fire, prepared for the
Devil and his Angels.</hi> All this is spoken, to shew
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:47528:248"/>
Carnal Men their Condition: O that they would
seriously think of it! When they do Evil, when
they slight the Motions of God's Grace, they are
under Satan; and not only by <hi>force,</hi> as a Child
of God may be sometimes, but they are willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. The more willingly we
commit Sin, still the more we are under the
Power of the Devil. Well then, if any have
need to say, <hi>Deliver us from Evil,</hi> certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed
Carnal Men, have need to go to God,
and say, Lord pluck us out of Evil; as the same
Expression is used, <hi>Col. 1. 13. Who hath delivered
us from the power of Darkness,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, who
hath delivered us with a <hi>strong hand.</hi> O go to
God, in the Name of Christ; there is no way of
escape, until God pluck you out by main force.
And mark, this Power by which we are delivered,
God conveyeth by the <hi>preaching</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi>
which was appointed to turn us from Darkness
unto Light, and from the Power of Satan unto
God, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. and therefore hearken to
God's Counsels, before your Condition grow
incurable, and wait upon the Ordinances; for
the more you neglect and contemn the means of
your Recovery, your misery increaseth upon
you; for every day you are still more given up
to Satan by the just Judgment of God, and to
be captivated and taken by him, at his will and
pleasure, by the Snares he sets for you.</p>
               <p>(2.) <hi>Good Men,</hi> or God's own Children,
though they are delivered from the Power of
Satan, and brought into the Kingdom of Christ,
yet they are not wholly free in this World, but
are sometimes caught <hi>by Satan's Wiles,</hi> Ephes. 6.
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:47528:249"/>
11. sometimes wounded by his <hi>fiery Darts,</hi> ver. 16.
Their Lusts, and their Consciences, are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
set a raging; though he hath no <hi>allowed</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over their Hearts, yet he exerciseth a
tyrannical Power; though he cannot <hi>rule</hi> them,
yet he ceaseth not to <hi>assault</hi> them, if it were but
to vex and trouble them. Briefly, the Children
of God have cause to pray <hi>(Deliver us from
Evil)</hi> in regard of Satan, because Satan hath a
hand in their <hi>Persecutions;</hi> and likewise a hand
in their <hi>Temptations</hi> to <hi>Sin.</hi> It is he that insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth
their Enemies to persecute them; and it is
he that inflameth their Lusts.</p>
               <p>1. In stirring up their Enemies to <hi>persecute</hi>
them. All the Troubles of the Children of God,
they come originally from the Devil; Luk. 22. 53.
<hi>This is your Hour, and the Power of Darkness.</hi> We
do not read that Satan did immediatly vex
Christ; and how was that Hour then said to be
the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Darkness?</hi> Why, by setting his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
a-work to crucify him. And as he
dealt with the <hi>Head,</hi> so with the <hi>Members.</hi> Rev.
12. 12. <hi>The Devil hath great Wrath, for he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
he hath but a short time.</hi> When his Kingdom
begins to totter and shake, then he stirs up all his
Wrath, and inflames his Instruments; as dying
Beasts bite hardest. So, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 14. we read of
the <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>Devils</hi> that go forth unto the <hi>Kings</hi>
of the Earth, to stir them up against the Saints.
If you could behold, with you bodily Eyes,
this Evil Spirit hanging upon the Ears of great
Men, and buzzing into them, and stirring them
up, and the common People, and animating
them against the Children of God, you would
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:47528:249"/>
more admire at the Wonders of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that you do subsist: O, how they are
acted by this wrathful Spirit!</p>
               <p>2. By inflaming our <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Corruptions.</hi> So,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5. lest Satan tempt you by your Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency;
sets Lusts a boiling, either to <hi>vex</hi> the
Saints, or to insnare them. It is possible he
may sometimes prevail with God's own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to draw them to some particular Act of
gross Sin; as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 4. as when <hi>David</hi> defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himself with Lust, that thereby he may <hi>disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
God; for by this means the Name of God
was blasphemed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. Or that thereby
he may disturb their <hi>Peace,</hi> for this made <hi>David</hi>
lie <hi>roaring,</hi> Psal. 32. 3, 4. his radical Moisture
was even wasted and exhausted. Or else to <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Sins,</hi> as Murmuring, Repining against God;
distrust of Providence, when under Crosses. Or
when they are in their <hi>Comforts,</hi> to drive them to
Carnal Complacency, and neglect of Holy Things,
disuse of Communion with God. Or to inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Passions, or <hi>Spiritual</hi> Wickedness, such as is
not conversant about Carnal Passions, or Fleshly
Lusts, but Spiritual Pride, Error, and Unbelief.
Certainly, those that have any thing of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Spiritual Life, cannot be ignorant of
Satan's Enterprizes.</p>
               <p>Well then, we had need go to God to deliver
us from Evil: For <hi>outward</hi> Evils, for the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of his <hi>Providence;</hi> for these God hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
<hi>Psal. 50. 15. Call upon me in the Day of
Trouble; I will deliver thee.</hi> Satan is in God's
Chains, he could not enter into the Herd of
Swine without leave; therefore certainly he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:47528:250"/>
get among the Sheep of Christ's Fold. It's
the saying of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> If the Bristles of Swine
be numbred, the Hairs of our Head are numbred;
therefore you had need go to God, <hi>(Deliver us
from Evil)</hi> that Persecution may not rage over
you; that he may hedg you in by his Providence,
<hi>Iob.</hi> 1. 10. and that he would be as a Wall of Fire
round about you.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>inward</hi> Evils, so we go to God for <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>Strength;</hi> for Satan assaults us both
ways, by <hi>Wiles</hi> and <hi>Darts;</hi> when he comes in a
way of <hi>Violence,</hi> he comes with fiery <hi>Darts;</hi> but
when he doth lie in <hi>Ambush,</hi> there he hath his
Wiles to intice us with a seeming Good.
We,</p>
               <p>1. Beg <hi>Wisdom,</hi> that you may espy the <hi>Wiles</hi>
of Satan, and may not be caught unawares, for
he <hi>is transformed into an Angel of Light,</hi> 2 Cor.
11. 14. Mark, the Devil doth not care so much
to ride his own Horses, to act and draw wicked
Men to Evil, he hath them sure enough; but he
laboureth to imploy the Saints in his Work, if
he can, to get one which belongs to God to do
his Business; therefore he changeth himself into
an Angel of Light. The Temptation is disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with very plausible Pretences, then a Child
of God may be a Factor for Satan, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of the Devil: For instance, Would
<hi>Peter</hi> have ever made a Motion for Satan, if he
had seen his Hand? O no; the Temptation was
disguised to him, when he perswaded his Master
from suffering. He covereth his foul Designs with
plausible Pretences. Carnal Counsel shall be pity
and natural Affection; Mat. 16. 22, 23. <hi>Let not
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:47528:250"/>
these things be; Be it far from thee, Lord: this
shall not be unto thee. He said unto</hi> Peter, <hi>Get thee
behind me, Satan, Thou art an Offence unto me.</hi> At
another time, the Disciples, when their Master
was slighted and contemned, they thought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they should do as <hi>Elias</hi> did, call for Fire
from Heaven to consume them, <hi>Luke. 9. 54. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi>
will often go for <hi>Zeal</hi> for God. Revenge,
or storming at Personal Affronts, or Injuries
done to our selves, is looked upon as Zeal; then
the Disciples may not know what Spirit they are
of Many times we are acted by the Devil, when we
think we are acted by the Spirit of God; and that
which seems to be Zeal, is nothing but Revenge.
Therefore we had need go to God; Lord, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us from Evil, we are poor unwary Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that we may not be insnared by fair Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
and surprised by his Enterprises. And
thus we beg Wisdom.</p>
               <p>2. We pray for <hi>Strength</hi> to withstand his
<hi>Darts,</hi> that we may take the Armour of God, and
withstand the Evil One, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 13. Alas! of
our selves, we cannot deliver our selves from the
least Evil, or stand out against the least Assault;
therefore it is God alone that must keep the Feet
of his Saints, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 9. Therefore we go to
him, that we may get his Covenant-strength,
that we may <hi>be strong in the power of his Might,</hi>
to conflict with Satan. Well then, in regard
of the first Enemy of our Salvation, the Devil,
we had need pray earnestly, That we may not
be prevailed over by his Arts; 'Tis God alone
that can keep us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:47528:251"/>
2<hi>dly,</hi> The <hi>World,</hi> that's another Evil, which is
as it were the Devil's Chess-Board; we can hardly
move backward or forward, but he is ready to
attach us, and surprize us by one Creature or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and draw us into the Snare; therefore it
is said, Gal. 1. 4. <hi>That Christ gave himself for us,
that he might deliver us from this present Evil World.</hi>
That's one way of being delivered from Evil,
when we are delivered from an Evil World. It
concerns us, and it is a great point of Religion to
be <hi>kept unspotted from the World,</hi> Jam. 1. 27. The
whole World is full of Evils and Temptations,
and we cannot walk any where but we are likely
to be defiled. The <hi>Things</hi> of the World, the

Plenty. <hi>David</hi> was not foiled while he wandred
up and down in the Wilderness, but when he
walked upon the Tarras of his Pallace in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
then he fell to Lust and Blood. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soundness
of a Vessel is not seen when it is empty,
but when fill'd with Water, then we see whether it
be stanch, or leaky or no.</p>
               <p>But the other Condition is not without its
Snares neither. In <hi>Adversity</hi> we are apt to be
<hi>impatient,</hi> as well as in <hi>Prosperity</hi> to be <hi>forgetful</hi> of
God; and therefore we had need learn how to go
up Hill and down Hill, to know how to <hi>abound,</hi>
and how to be <hi>abased, Phil.</hi> 4. 12. Look, as the
Wind doth rise from all Corners, so do Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
When we are kept low and bare, or in
Danger, then we are full of worldly Fears, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusts,
Cares, grow base, Pusillanimous, and
have not the Spirit and Generosity of a Christian;
in a high Condition we are Proud, Secure, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
of Changes, Vain, Wanton; and press
towards Heaven less, and grow dead to good
Things.</p>
               <p>2. As from the Things of the World, so from
the <hi>Men</hi> of the World. We are apt to be poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their <hi>bad Example,</hi> and easily catch a Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
one from another. Good Men may receive
a taint, Isa. 6. 5. <hi>I am a Man of unclean Lips, and
I dwell in the midst of a People of unclean Lips.</hi>
Open Excesses do soon manifest their own Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:47528:252"/>
I confess, a Man that runs into open
Excess, we are not so much in danger of being
inticed by him to the like Practice; but we learn
of one another secretly to be cold, careless, and
less mortified. I say, tho we are not carried
into inordinate Practices, and gross Wickednesses,
by the Example of others; yet we learn to be
cold in the Profession of Godliness, formal, less
stirring in the way of Holiness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sometimes
ensnared by their Counsels; the Flood and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of Evil Examples and Counsels is so great
that it carrieth away Men. Gal. 2. 13. <hi>Barnabas
also was carried away with their Dissimulation.</hi> And
the <hi>Wills</hi> of Men is one of our Snares, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 2.
And besides, we are in danger to be <hi>terrified</hi> by
their <hi>Frowns,</hi> and act unseemly. Isa. 8. 13. <hi>Fear
not their Fear, nor be afraid;</hi> out of the fear of
Men we are apt to miscarry in our Duty to God.
Well then, we need to go to God to be delivered
from the Evil of the World, that we may not be
infected nor terrified by the Men of the World;
or, which is the more usual Temptation, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the Things of the World. The World
doth secretly and sligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly insinuate with us, and
therefore keep us from Evil.</p>
               <p>Now how comes the World to be Evil?</p>
               <p>In two things; when both our Care, and
our Delight, is lessened towards Heavenly
Things.</p>
               <p>1. When our <hi>Care</hi> is lessened, when we are not
so serious, so frequent in Communion with God,
as we were wont to be; as <hi>Martha</hi> that <hi>was cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:47528:252"/>
about many things, but</hi> Mary <hi>had chosen the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part,</hi> Luke 10. 42. When you begin to lessen
your Cares of Duty, and <hi>Hagar</hi> thrusts <hi>Sarah</hi> out
of Doors; when the Son of the Bond-Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to mock at the Son of the Free-Woman;
when Religion begins to be looked upon but as
Mopishness; to be so nice, precise, and so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to maintain constant Commerce with God,
and begin to have lessening Thoughts of God, and
Religion goes to the Walls. So,</p>
               <p>2. When our <hi>Delight</hi> is less in heavenly things;
when we have lost our favour of the Word, and
Ordinances, and Sabbaths, and they are not so
sweet as before; 1 Joh. 2. 16. <hi>If any Man love the
World, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> When
the Love of the World hath made you weary of
the Love of God; when your Heart goes a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from God the chief Good: As when the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are scattered, a Man is tempted to look
upon other Objects, the Wife of the Bosom is
defrauded of her Right: So God is defrauded by
an over-delight in the Creature, the World inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
your Delight. Psal. 73. 27, 28. <hi>Thou hast
destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. But it
is good for me to draw nigh to God.</hi> When our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in Communion with God is lessened by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the Creature, 'tis Spiritual Adultery.
Now when worldly Objects are so continually
with us, solliciting our Affections, and drawing
us away from God; Oh! what need have the
best of us to pray, <hi>Lord keep us from Evil!</hi> The
Soul doth easily receive a taint from the Objects
to which we are accustomed; therefore they
which live in the World had need to take heed of
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:47528:253"/>
a worldly Spirit. The continual Presence of the
Object doth secretly intice the Heart; as long
Suits prevail at length, and green Wood kindles
by long lying in the Fire. Insensibly is the Heart
drawn away from God, and you shall find less fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in Holy Things.</p>
               <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> We had need to pray earnestly, Lord
keep us from Evil, because we are in danger of
that other Enemy, the <hi>Flesh.</hi> There is not only
an Evil <hi>without</hi> us, as the Devil, and the World,
but an Evil <hi>within us: An Evil Heart of Vnbelief, in
departing from the Living God,</hi> Heb. 3. 12. An
Evil Heart that is full of urgings and sollicitations
to Sin. There are not only Snares and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the World, but there is a flexibleness in
the Party tempted. Jam. 1. 14. <hi>Every Man is tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when he is drawn away of his own Lust, and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of his own Lusts;
the Fire burns in our own Hearts, Satan doth but
blow up the Flame: there is bad Liquor in the
Vessel, Satan doth but only give it vent, and set
it abroach with violence: We carry sinning Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
about with us, therefore, Lord, <hi>Deliver us
from Evil.</hi> The Evil of the World would do no
more hurt than the Fire doth to a Stone, if we
were not combustible Matter, <hi>The Corruption that
is in the World through Lust,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of living in the World doth not stand in this,
because here are so many Inticements and Baits
for every Sense, but it's the Corruption through
<hi>Lust;</hi> as the Venom is not in the Flower, but
Spider. The <hi>Philistines</hi> could not prevail against
<hi>Sampson,</hi> if <hi>Dalilah,</hi> on whom he doted, had not
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:47528:253"/>
lull'd him asleep. Or as <hi>Balaam</hi> first corrupted
<hi>Israel,</hi> before he could curse them, or bring them
any harm: So Corruption in the Heart makes us
liable to Satan's Malice. There is a treacherous
Party within to open the Door to Satan, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which all outward Force could not annoy
us.</p>
               <p>Well then, we had need go to God: Lord,
<hi>Deliver us from Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where we beg,</p>
               <p>1. That God would weaken the strength of
inbred Corruption, that we may not be foiled by
it. <hi>Paul</hi> groans sadly, Rom. 7. 24. <hi>O wretched
Man that I am, who shall deliver me from the Body of
this Death?</hi> It is a Question, but it implyeth a
<hi>Wish,</hi> for the <hi>Hebrews</hi> propose their Wishes by
way of Question, that is, O that I were delivered!
It is a great Mercy to be kept from falling into
Sin; <hi>Kept from every Evil Work,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 18.</p>
               <p>2. If we be foiled by our Corruption, we beg
that we may not lie in it, nor grow weary of our
Resistance, nor cast away our Weapons, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Sin to have a quiet Reign. Psal. 119. 133. <hi>Let
not any Iniquity have dominion over me.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hope for a total exemption from Sin, but O
Lord let it not reign over us. How shall we know
when Sin reigns? When there is no course of
Mortification set up against it, to break the Power,
Force, and Tyranny of it. Take this Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
There are <hi>remaining,</hi> and <hi>reserved</hi> Corruptions,
Sin remains where it doth not reign; but reserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Corruption that's reigning. I will explain it
thus; Sin <hi>remains,</hi> when notwithstanding all our
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:47528:254"/>
Endeavours, yet it still haunts and pesters us, tho
praying, watching, striving, waiting, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon God for Strength; but it is reserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when you let it alone, and are loth to touch it,
but rather cherish, dandle, and foster it in the
Heart, and make provision for it. Therefore
then are we delivered from Evil, when we reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by Repentance; and tho we suffer by the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of Sin, we will not let it alone to have a
quiet reign in our Hearts: Do not live under the
Power of Corruptions. Sin let alone will do us
farther Mischief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As we have reason to pray to God
with earnestness, because of our Danger; so with
<hi>Confidence,</hi> because of God's Undertaking, 2 Thes.
3. 3. <hi>The Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and
keep you from Evil.</hi> God hath undertaken to keep
those who with humble and broken Hearts do
come to him to be kept from Evil; that are watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
serious, and careful to get Evils redressed as
soon as discerned; therefore we may come with
an assured Confidence to be delivered from all
Evil.</p>
               <p>How far hath God undertaken to keep his
People from Evils and Dangers in this Life? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</p>
               <p>1. So far as may be hurtful to their Souls.
1 Cor. 10. 13. <hi>God is faithful, who will not suffer you
to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the
Temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be
able to bear it.</hi> It is part of God's Faithfulness to
keep you from Evil, to proportion and temper
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:47528:254"/>
Temptation to your Strength. God suits the
Burden to every Back, he drives on as the little
Ones are able to bear, therefore certainly he will
mitigate Temptation, or give in supply of
Strength.</p>
               <p>2. God will keep you from the Evil of <hi>Sin,</hi> so
far as it is <hi>deadly;</hi> that is, that it be not a Sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Death, 1 Iohn</hi> 5. 16. and that it may not <hi>reign</hi>
in our mortal Bodies, for you are dead to it. Rom.
6. 14. <hi>For Sin shall not have Dominion over you: for
ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. God undertakes for our <hi>Final</hi> Deliverance
from all Evil, upon our translation to Heaven.
This is included in this Prayer, that we may at
length come to that State, where is no Sorrow, no
Sin, no Assault and Temptation from Satan, that
we may be kept from all Wickedness. Psal. 34. 19.
<hi>Many are the Afflictions of the Righteous: but the Lord
delivereth him out of them all.</hi> There is a time when
God delivereth us from all at once, and that is by
Death, and our Translation into Heaven.</p>
               <p>Well then, Let us fly to God for Deliverance,
waiting for his Help.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That to be kept from the Evil of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is a greater Mercy than to be kept from
the Trouble of Temptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us from
Evil:</hi> That is, If we be led into Temptation,
let us be kept from the Evil of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:47528:255"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It's a more wonderful Providence to be
kept from <hi>Evil</hi> than from <hi>Temptation; Esse bonum
facile est, ubi quod vetat esse remo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>um est.</hi> It is no
great matter to be Chast or Honest, when there's
no Temptation to the contrary; Ay, but to keep
our Integrity in the midst of Assaults and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
there's the wonder: If a Garrison be never
assaulted, 'tis no wonder that it standeth exempt
from the Calamity of War: This is like the Bush
that was burned, yet not consumed; exercised
with Temptation from Day to Day, and yet kept
from Evil. And in this Sence God's Power is
more glorified, than in keeping the Angels; for the
Angels are out of Gun-shot, and Harms-way, and
not liable to Temptations: But to preserve a poor
weak Creature in the midst of Temptation, O!
how is the Power of God <hi>made perfect in Weakness?</hi>
2 Cor. 12. 9. <hi>Perfected,</hi> that is, gloriously disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Evil of Sin is greater than the
Evil of Affliction or Trouble.</p>
               <p>1. The Evil of Sin is the greater Evil, because
it separateth from God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 2. 'Tis an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from the Chiefest Good. Affliction doth not
separate from God, 'tis a means to make us draw
nigh to him. Poverty, Sickness, Blindness, Loss
of Goods, let a Man be never so low and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
yet if in a state of Grace, the Lord taketh
pleasure in him, and he is near and dear to God;
God kisseth him with the Kisses of his Mouth, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is loathsom to God but Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:47528:255"/>
2. Sin is Evil in it self, whether we feel it or no;
Affliction is not Evil in it self, but in our Sense
and Feeling, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. Sin is Evil, whether we
feel it or no; 'Tis worse when we do not feel
it. <hi>Past Feeling, Eph.</hi> 4. 19. when our Conscience
is benummed.</p>
               <p>3. Affliction, or <hi>Malum Poenae,</hi> is an Act of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Justice: but <hi>Malum Culpae,</hi> is an Act of Man's
Corruptness. For the first, Affliction. Amos 6. 3.
<hi>Is there any Evil, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> But
Sin is the Devil's work in us; 1 John 3. 8. <hi>He that
committeth Sin, is of the Devil; for the Devil sinneth
from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God
was manifested, that he might destroy the Works of the
Devil.</hi> And Joh. 8. 34. <hi>Whosoever committeth Sin,
is the Servant of Sin.</hi> The one cometh from a just
God, the other from our corrupt Hearts. The
one is the Act of an Holy God, the other the Act
of a sinful Creature.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The Death of Christ falls more directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Benefit, exemption from Sin. Mat.</hi> 1. 21.
He shall save his People from their Sins. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 26.
God having raised up his Son Iesus, sent him to bless
you, in turning away every one of you from his Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<hi>not Troubles, or Sorrows, but Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Affliction is a more particular temporal
Evil, but Sin is an infinite universal Evil; Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
depriveth us of Health, Poverty of Wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And every adverse Providence doth but oppose
some particular temporal Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Sin depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
us of God, who is the Fountain of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
the other but of some limited Comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:47528:256"/>
6. Afflictions are sent to remove Sin. Heb.
12. 11. <hi>Now no chastning for the present seemeth to be
joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it
yieldeth the peaceable Fruit of Righteousness, unto
them which are exercised thereby.</hi> Isa. 26. 9. <hi>When
thy Iudgments are in the Earth, the Inhabitants of
the World will learn Righteousness.</hi> But Sin is not
sent to remove Affliction. Now the End must be
greater than the Means, both as to Prosecution
and Aversation. As to Prosecution; To dig for
Iron with Mattocks of Gold and Silver. So in
Aversation; If Death were not worse than the
Pain of Physick, no Man would take Physick to
avoid Death.</p>
               <p>7. Affliction is the Effect of God's Love. Heb.
12. 6. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth, he chastneth.</hi> But
to be left to Sin, is an Effect of God's Anger.
God doth not always exempt from Troubles; yet
if he keep from Spiritual hurt thereby, if he
sanctify the Trouble, support us with sufficient
Grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. if preserved from Evil,
howsoever tempted and exercised, 'tis enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To reprove our Folly. We complain
of other Things, but we do not complain of
Sin, which is the greatest Evil. This is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Spirit of God's Children, who rejoice
in Troubles, but not in Sins; 2 Cor. 12. 9. <hi>Most
gladly therefore will I rejoice in Infirmities, that the
Power of Christ may rest upon me.</hi> They groan
bitterly under Sins, <hi>Rom. 7. 23. O wretched
Man,</hi> &amp;c. If any Man had cause to complain of
Afflictions, <hi>Paul</hi> had: In Perils often, Whipped,
Persecuted, Stoned. But the Body of Sin and
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:47528:256"/>
Death was the greatest Burden; Lusts troubled
him more than Scourges; his Captivity to the
Law of Sin, more than Prisons. When Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sitteth too close, Sin sits loose. In Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there is some Offence done us; but in Sin,
the wrong is done to God; And what are we to
God? Afflictions may be good, but Sin is never
good. The Body suffereth by Affliction, but the
Soul suffereth by Sin, loss of Grace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
which are not to be valued by all the World's
Enjoyments. The Evil of Affliction, is but for
a moment, like Rain, it drieth up of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord:
But the Evil of Sin is for ever, unless it
be pardoned and taken away. Sin is the Cause
of all the Evils of Affliction; therefore when
we complain, we should complain, not so much
of the Smart, as of the Cause of it.</p>
               <p>2. It directeth us;</p>
               <p>(1.) How to pray to God, against Sin rather
than Trouble. This is indeed to be delivered
from Evil; 2 Tim. 4. 18. <hi>Paul</hi> reckoned upon
that, <hi>He will deliver me from every evil Work.</hi>
When afflicted, you should rather desire to have
the Affliction sanctified, than removed; you will
be most careful, for that Saints do not pray for the
Interests of the Old Man, rather than the New Man.
To be freed from Trouble, is a common Mercy;
but to have it sanctified, is a special Mercy.
Carnal Men may be without Affliction, but
Carnal Men cannot have experience of Grace.
Bare deliverance is no sign of special Love.</p>
               <p>(2.) In our choice: 'Twas an heavy Charge
they put upon <hi>Iob;</hi> Job 36. 21. <hi>Thou hast chosen
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:47528:257"/>
Iniquity rather than Affliction.</hi> Sometimes we are
put upon the trial, To loose the Favour of God,
or the Favour of Men, Duty and Danger:
Here content my self, gratify my Lusts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests;
there, offend God. Out of the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
we could easily judg, that all the Misery
in the World is to be endured, rather than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the least Sin. But how is it upon a trial,
when a Worldly Convenience, and a Spiritual
Inconvenience is proposed? By chusing Sin, a
Man cannot altogether escape Affliction, here,
or hereafter. Wickedness, though it prosper a
while, yet at length it proveth a Snare.</p>
               <p>3. It directeth us to submit to God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and to own Mercy in it: Though God
doth not exempt us from Troubles, yet if he
keep us from Hurt thereby; if he sanctify the
Trouble, and support us with Grace sufficient,
'tis his Mercy to us. For <hi>Daniel</hi> to be put into
the Lion's Den, was not so great a Judgment,
as for <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to have the Heart of a
Beast. To be given up to our own Hearts Lusts,
to commit any Sin, 'tis a greater Cross than any
Misery that can light upon us; therefore let us
be patient under Affliction. Our great Care
should be, not to dishonour God in any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
God hath promised to be with his People
in their Afflictions, to comfort them; but hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
promised to be with his People in their Sins;
<hi>I will be with you in the Fire, and in the Water;</hi>

them.</hi> In Affliction, 'tis a time to
put the Promises in suit; it doth not hinder our

driveth us to it. But Sin increaseth our Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,

               <head>For thine is the Kingdom, and the Power,
and the Glory, for ever. Amen.</head>
               <p>IN these words we have the Conclusion of all,
and that which giveth us confidence in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
we make to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Confirmation is taken from the
<hi>Excellency</hi> of God to whom we pray; where
there is a declaration of what belongeth to
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Duration and Perpetuity, <hi>for
Ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three things are mentioned as belonging to
God; <hi>Kingdom, Power,</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By <hi>Kingdom</hi> is meant, God's Right and
Authority over all things, by which he
can dispose of them according to his own
pleasure.</item>
                  <item>2. By <hi>Power</hi> is meant, his Sufficiency to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
this Right, and to do what he pleaseth,
both in Heaven and Earth.</item>
                  <item>3. The final cause of all, is his <hi>Glory: Thine
is the Glory;</hi> or the Honour of all things
in the World belongs to thee. <hi>Glory</hi> is
Excellency discovered with praise. We
desire that he may be more honoured and
brought into request and esteem.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="501" facs="tcp:47528:258"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have the <hi>Obsignation,</hi> and sealing
of our Requests, in the word <hi>Amen;</hi> which is,
<hi>Signaculum Fidei,</hi> an Expression of our Faith and
Hope: And <hi>actus desiderii,</hi> the strength of our
<hi>Desire.</hi> There is the <hi>Amen</hi> of Faith, and the
<hi>Amen</hi> of hearty Desire; as by and by.</p>
               <p>Now let us look upon this Conclusion, first, as
a <hi>Doxology,</hi> or expression of <hi>praise</hi> to God: And
the Note is;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That in every Address to God, lauding or
praising of God is necessary.</p>
               <p>For in this perfect Form of Prayer, Christ
teaches us, not only to ask things needful for our
selves, but to ascribe to God things proper to
him.</p>
               <p>There are two words used in this Case in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Blessing: Praise,</hi> relateth to God's
<hi>Excellency;</hi> and <hi>Blessing,</hi> to his <hi>Benefits;</hi> Psalm
145. 10. <hi>All thy Works shall praise thee, O Lord;
and thy Saints shall bless thee.</hi> All the Works of
God declare his Excellency; but the Saints will
ever be ascribing to God, the Benefits they have
received from him. So they are spoken of as
Things, though somewhat <hi>alike,</hi> yet as <hi>distinct;</hi>
Nehem. 9. 5. <hi>Blessed be thy glorious Name, which
is exalted above all Blessing and Praise.</hi> Our <hi>Praise</hi>
cannot reach the Excellency of his <hi>Nature;</hi> nor
our <hi>Blessing,</hi> express the Worth of his <hi>Benefits.</hi>
Both may be here intended. For thine is <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>Power,</hi> relateth to his <hi>Excellency;</hi> and
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:47528:259"/>
thine is the <hi>Glory,</hi> to his <hi>Benefits;</hi> for God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is the Reflex of all his Works, and so expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Benefits shewed to the Sons of <hi>Men,</hi>
especially to his People. Well then, when-ever
you would pray to God to bless you, you must
bless God again, and praise his Name; Ephes.
1. 3. <hi>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual
Blessings in Heavenly Places in Christ.</hi> 'Tis the
Eccho and Reflex of his Grace and Mercy to the
Creatures. God blesseth us, and we bless God;
as the Eccho returneth the Word, or the Wall
beateth back the Beams of the Sun. Only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
We bless God far otherwise than he bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
us: God's Blessing is operative, ours decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative;
His words are accompanied with Power,
<hi>Benedicere,</hi> is <hi>Benefacere.</hi> He doth good, we
speak good, when we remember the blessed Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his Grace, and tell what he hath done
for our Souls.</p>
               <p>The Reasons why we are to mingle Praises and
Thanksgiving with our Requests, are these;</p>
               <p>1. Because this complieth more with the great
end of Worship; which is not so much the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of Man,</hi> as the <hi>Honour of God;</hi> therefore we
should not only intend the supply of our Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
for that's but a brutish Cry, howling for
Corn, Wine, and Oil, <hi>Hosea</hi> 7. 14. But we
should intend also the Honour of God; Psal. 50.
23. <hi>Whoso offereth praise, glorifieth me.</hi> A Man
may offer Requests to God, yet not honour him,
but seek himself; but he that offereth Praise,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:47528:259"/>
glorifieth me: He that doth affectionately, and
from his Heart, give God the honour of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
and Titles in Scripture, he glorifieth
him; and therefore Worship being for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> God, that should not be left out.</p>
               <p>2. This is the most effectual spiritual Oratory,
or way of praying. Psal. 67. 5. <hi>Let the People
praise thee, O God, Let all the People praise thee.</hi>
What then? <hi>Then shall the Earth yield her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease;
and God, even our own God, shall bless us.</hi>
We have Comforts increased, the more we praise
God for what we have already received. The
more Vapours go up, the more Showrs come
down; as the Rivers receive, so they pour out,
and all run into the Sea again. There is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
circular Course and Recourse from the Sea,
unto the Sea: So there is between God and us;
the more we praise him, the more our Blessings
come down; and the more his Blessings come
down, the more we praise him again; so that
we do not so much bless God, as bless our selves.
When the Springs lie low, we pour a little Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Pump; not to inrich the Fountain,
but to bring up more for our selves.</p>
               <p>3. It's the noblest part of Worship, and most
excellent and acceptable Service. It is a great
honour to Creatures, to bestow blessing upon
God. In other Duties, God is bestowing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
on us; but in praise (according to our
manner, and as Creatures can) we bestow some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon God. In <hi>Prayer,</hi> we come as <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,</hi>
expecting an Alms: In <hi>Hearing,</hi> we come
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:47528:260"/>
as <hi>Scholars</hi> and <hi>Disciples,</hi> expecting Instruction
from God: Here (according to our Measure
and Ability) we give something to him; not
because he <hi>needs</hi> it, being infinitely perfect, but
because he <hi>deserves</hi> it, being infinitely <hi>gracious.</hi>
This is the Work of Angels and glorified Saints.
Other Duties more agree with our imperfect
State, as Hearing and Prayer, that our Wants
may be supplied; but this Duty agrees with our
State when we are most perfect. <hi>Love</hi> is the
<hi>Grace</hi> of Heaven, and <hi>Praise</hi> the <hi>Duty</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
we are for Vials, they Harps; Prayer is
our main Work, and Praise theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> To reprove us, that we are altogether
for the supply of our Necessities, but little think
of giving God the honour due to his Name.
Either we meddle not with it at all, or do it in
a very slighty fashion. In this perfect form, the
Glory of God is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and the ending of this short Prayer;
the first Petition, it is for God's Glory, and the
final Conclusion also. And therefore it is verily
a Fault, that God is no more praised. In our
Addresses to him (<hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 3.) it's said, <hi>O thou
that inhabitest the Praises of Israel;</hi> the meaning
is, dwellest in <hi>Israel,</hi> where he is praised of
them, because it is the great Work they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
               <p>Surely our Assemblies should more resound
with the Praises of God. In Church-Worship,
there should be a mixture of <hi>Harps,</hi> which are
Instruments of Praise, as well as <hi>Vials</hi> full of
Odors, which are <hi>the Prayers of the Saints,</hi> Rev.
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:47528:260"/>
5. 8. But usually we thrust Gratulation,
Thanksgiving, and Praise, into a narrow Room,
and are scanty therein, but can be large and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
in expressing our Wants, and begging a
Supply. This Duty is made too great a Stranger
in your dealings with God. What are the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of this Defect?</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Self-Love.</hi> We are eager to have Blessings,
but we forget to return, to give God the Glory:
<hi>Prayer</hi> is a Work of <hi>Neeessity,</hi> but <hi>Praise</hi> a Work
of <hi>Duty,</hi> and Homage. Self-Love puts us upon
Prayer, but the Love of God upon Praise. Now
because we are so full of Self-Love, therefore are
we so backward to this Duty.</p>
               <p>2. A second Cause is, our stupid <hi>Negligence;</hi>
we do not gather up Matter of Thanksgiving,
and observe God's gracious dealing with us, that
we may have wherewith to inlarge our selves in
giving Glory to his Name; Col. 4. 2. <hi>Continue
in Prayer, and watch in the same with Thanksgiving.</hi>
We should continually observe God's Answers
and Visits of Love; and what Attributes he
makes good to us in the course of his Providence.
But out of Spiritual Laziness, we do not take
notice of these things, therefore no wonder if
we are backward to speak good of his Name,
but are always whining, murmuring, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is not only a <hi>Doxology,</hi> but a <hi>full</hi>
one, and very expressive of the Excellency of
God. From whence note;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="506" facs="tcp:47528:261"/>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> The Saints are not niggardly and sparing in
praising of God; Kingdom, Power, and
Glory, and all that is excellent, they ascribe
to him.</p>
               <p>A gracious Heart hath such a sense of God's
Worth and Excellency, that he thinks he can
never speak honourably enough of it. See how
<hi>David</hi> inlargeth himself very sutably to what is
spoken here, 1 <hi>Chron. 29. 10, 11, 12, 13. And</hi>
David <hi>said, Blessed be thou, Lord God, for ever
and ever: Thine, O Lord, is the Greatness, and
the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the
Majesty: thine is the Kingdom, O Lord, and thou
art exalted as Head above all. Now therefore, our
God, We thank thee, and praise thy gloriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Name.</hi>
O, when once a Child of God, falls upon speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, he cannot tell how to come out of
the Meditation; he seeth so much is due to God,
that he heaps words upon words. So, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.
17. <hi>Now unto the King Eternal, Immortal, Invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the only Wise God, be Honour and Glory, for
ever and ever. Amen.</hi> And in many other places of
Scripture. Now this copiousness in praising of
God, is, <hi>partly,</hi> because of the <hi>excellency</hi> of the
<hi>Object;</hi> Nehem. 9. 5. <hi>Blessed be thy glorious Name,
which is exalted above all Blessing and Praise.</hi> When
they have done what they can to bless God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
his Benefits, or praise God, and recount
his Excellencies, still they come too far short:
Therefore when we cannot do all, we should do
much. And <hi>partly,</hi> it is from the <hi>greatness</hi> and
largeness of their <hi>Affection,</hi> they think never to
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:47528:261"/>
have done enough for God, whom they love so
much. <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>I will praise him yet more
and more.</hi> They cannot satisfy themselves, by
taking up the Excellency of God in one Notion
only; therefore Majesty, Greatness, Glory,
Wisdom, and Power, they mention all things
which are honourable and glorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> The Use is again, to reprove us for being
so cold and sparing this way. It argueth a want
of a due sense of God's Excellency, and strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Spiritual Affection. Therefore we should
study God more, and observe his manifold Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies.
Get a greater esteem of him in your
Hearts; for <hi>out of the abundance of the Heart, the
Mouth will speak.</hi> We should be calling upon
our selves, as <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 103. 1. Bless the Lord,
O my Soul; and all that is within me, bless his Holy
Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I observe again; It is brought in with
a <hi>For,</hi> as relating to the foregoing Petitions;

Observe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> It is a great relief to a Soul, in praying
to God, to consider, that <hi>his</hi> is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Power, and Glory; and all these for
ever.</p>
               <p>His is the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>God hath the Soveraign <hi>Government</hi> of all
Things. And then his Right to govern, is
backed with all-sufficient Power and <hi>Strength;</hi>
and so he can dispose of his Soveraignty for the
bringing to pass what we expect from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Authority</hi> is one thing, and <hi>Power</hi> another, but
they <hi>both</hi> meet in God; He hath all Power and
Authority.</p>
               <p>And then, His is the <hi>Glory:</hi> He is concerned as
well as we; yea more, His Interest is greater than
ours, for the Glory of all belongs to him. And
all this, not for a Time, but for ever. These are
the Encouragements to raise our Confidence, that
our Prayers shall be heard, and granted, when
we ask any thing according to his Will.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>here are two things that give us Confidence
in any that we sue to, if he be <hi>Able</hi> and <hi>Willing.</hi>
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:47528:262"/>
Now God is <hi>able</hi> to grant our Requests, and very
prone and <hi>willing</hi> also. We are taught it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
in this Prayer; for we begin with him as
<hi>Father,</hi> and we end with him as a glorious and
powerful <hi>King:</hi> His fatherly Affection (on the
one hand) shews, That he is <hi>willing;</hi> and his
Royal Power (on the other) that he is <hi>able.</hi>
So that if we ask any thing according to his
Will, we need not doubt. We may gather his
Power and Will out of this very Clause: His
<hi>Power;</hi> for <hi>His is the Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> or a
Right and Authority, backed with absolute All-sufficiency.
Then his <hi>Will, Thine is the Glory;</hi>
It is his Glory to grant our Petitions, not only
matter of Happiness to us, but of Glory to God,
therefore we need not doubt.</p>
               <p>But more particularly:</p>
               <p>(1.) There is Confidence established by that,
that his is the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> God's Kingdom is either
<hi>Vniversal,</hi> over all Men or Things; or particular
and <hi>special,</hi> which notes his Relation to the
Saints, to those which have given up themselves
to his Government, to be guided by him to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Glory: and both these are grounds of
Confidence.</p>
               <p>1. His <hi>Vniversal</hi> Kingdom over all <hi>Persons</hi>
and Things in the World. This Kingdom is an
absolute Monarchy, with a plenary Dominion and
Propriety grounded upon his Creation of them.
There is a two-fold Dominion, <hi>Dominium Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis,</hi>
and <hi>Dominium Proprietatis:</hi> The one is
such as a King hath over his Subjects; the other,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:47528:263"/>
such as a King hath in his Goods and Lands:
The latter is greater than the former. A King
hath a Dominion of Jurisdiction over his <hi>Subjects,</hi>
to command and govern them; but he hath not
such an absolute propriety in their Persons, as
he hath in his own Goods and Lands; He may
dispose of them absolutely at his own Pleasure,
but his Jurisdiction is limited. In short, We must
distinguish of his Dominion, as a <hi>Ruler,</hi> and as
an <hi>Owner.</hi> But both these, they concur in God,
and that in the highest degree, for God is <hi>Owner</hi>
as well as <hi>Ruler;</hi> he made all Things out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
therefore hath a more absolute dominion
over us, than any Potentate or King can have,
not only over his Subjects, but his Goods; And
can govern all Things, Men, Angels, and Devils,
according to his Pleasure. It is more absolute,
than any Superiority in the World, and more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
as comprizing all Persons and Things;
God hath right to be King, because he gave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all things, which no Earthly P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tentate can.
Therefore the Author must be owner; All other
Kings are liable to be called to account and
reckoning by this great King, for their Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration;
but God is Absolute and Supream.</p>
               <p>Now this is a great incouragement to us, that
we go to a God that hath an absolute Right,
for which he is responsible to none. We go not
to a Servant, or a subordinate Agent, who may
be controul'd by a higher Power, and whose
Act may be disanulled; but to an absolute Lord,
to whom none can say, <hi>What dost thou?</hi> Job 9. 12.
Here's the Comfort of a Believer, that he goes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
to the Fountain, and Owner of all Things;
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:47528:263"/>
the Absolute Lord of all the World, is his Father;
the soveraign and free disposing of all Things, is in
his Hand. If we expect any thing from subordinate
Instruments, God's leave must first be asked, or
they can do nothing for us; but he can do what
he pleaseth, 'tis his own; Mat. 20. 15. <hi>Is it not
lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?</hi> None
can call him to an account.</p>
               <p>2. His <hi>Relation</hi> to the <hi>Saints.</hi> It is the Duty
of a King to defend his Subjects, and provide for
their welfare: So God being King, will see,
that it be well with those that are under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
It concerns you much to get an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
to be under this King, then to mention it
in Prayer: Psal. 44. 4. <hi>Thou art my King, O God,
command deliverances for</hi> Jacob. If you want
any thing for your selves, or the Church, put
God in mind of his Relation to you, <hi>Thou are
my King.</hi> Let not this Interest lie neglected or
unpleaded. All the Benefit which Subjects can
expect from a potent King, you may expect from

So, Psal. 5. 2. <hi>Hearken unto the Voice of my Cry,
my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray,</hi>
to thee, and to none other. Why should we go
to Servants, when we may go to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?
So, Psal. 74 12. <hi>For God is my King of old,
working Salvation in the midst of the Earth.</hi> God
will defend his Kingdom, and right his injur'd

Subjects. Therefore if we would have any
Blessing to be accomplished for our selves, or for
the Publick, let us go to God, <hi>Thine is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
And more especially, if we would have
any good thing to be done, by those in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and subordinate Power over us, do not so
much treat with them, as with God. Let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
God to perswade and incline their Hearts,

what shall be for the glory of his Name, and the
comfort and benefit of his afflicted People. Let
us go to God, who is the sovereign King, he
can give you to live <hi>a quiet and peaceable Life, in
all Godliness and Honesty,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 2. Or, he can
give you Favour, dispose of their Hearts to do
good to his People. Nehem. 1. 11. <hi>Prosper, I
pray thee, thy Servant this day, and grant him Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

<hi>Lord, if thou wilt thou canst make me clean.</hi> You

will do what is in the Power of his Hand.
A Beggar when he seeth an ordinary Man coming,
lets him pass without much Importunity; but
when he seeth a Man well habited, well attended,
and with rich Accoutrements, he runs close to him,
and will not let him alone, but follows him with
his Clamor, knows it is in his power to help him:
So this should encourage us to go to the mighty
God, which made Heaven and Earth, and all
things out of nothing.</p>
               <p>The third Argument which Christ propounds;
<hi>Thine is the Glory:</hi> The Honour and Glory of all
will redound to God, as the Comfort accrueth to
us; it is for God's Honour to shew forth his
P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wer in our Relief, and to be as good as his
Word. Now this is a ground of Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idence,
That he hath joyned his Glory and our Good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther:
And that God's Praise waiteth, while our
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>liverance waiteth. Psal. 65. 1. <hi>Praise waiteth
for thee, O God, in Zion.</hi> You think your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
stays, and all this while God's Honour waits.
So Psal. 112. 1. <hi>Praise ye the Lord; Blessed is the
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at his Servants are the only and blessed People
in the World. And this is a wonderful ground of
Confidence. Think, surely God's Glory he will
be chary and tender of, he will provide for the
Glory of his great Name. There is nothing God
stands upon more, than upon the Glory of his
Name; nothing prevaileth with God more than
that. If God were a loser by your Comforts;
if he could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ave or bless thee without wrong
done to himself, we might be discouraged: But
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:47528:266"/>
when you can come and plead with him, as <hi>Abigail,</hi>
It will be no grief of Heart unto my Lord to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
thy Servant: So, it will be no loss to God
if he shew Mercy and Pity to such poor Creatures
as we are; you then may pray more freely and
boldly. If thy Comforts were inconsistent with his
Glory, or were not so greatly exalted by it,
then it were another matter; but all makes for the
Glory of his Name. If our Good and Happiness
were only concerned in it, there might be some
Suspicion; but the Glory of God is concerned,
which is more worth than all the World: We
are unworthy to be heard and accepted, but God
is worthy to be honoured. It is for the Honour
of God, to choose base, mean, and contemptible
Things, and to shew forth the Riches, Goodness,
Power, and Treasure of his Glory. Much of our
Trouble and Distrust comes only from reflecting
upon our <hi>own Good</hi> in the Mercies that we ask,
as if God were not concerned in them; whereas
the Lord is concerned as well as you. As the Ivy
wrapt about the Tree, cannot be hurt, except you
do hurt to the Tree: So, the Lord hath twisted
our Concernment about his own Honour and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Thus the Saints plead God's Glory as an
Argument, Jer. 14. 7. <hi>O Lord, tho our Iniquitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

testify against us, do thou it for thy Names sake.</hi> They
do not tell him <hi>what</hi> he shall do, but do thou that
which shall be for thy Glory. So, Ezek. 36. 22.
<hi>Thus saith the Lord God, I do not this for your sakes,
O House of</hi> Israel, <hi>but for mine holy Names sake.</hi> So
Isa. 48. 9. <hi>For my Names sake will I defer mine anger,
and for my Praise will I refrain for thee; that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>

                  <pb n="516" facs="tcp:47528:267"/>
(4.) The <hi>Duration, For ever;</hi> all Excellencies
which are in God, they are <hi>eternally</hi> in God. God
is an infinite, simple, independent Being, the
Cause of all things, but caused by none; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was from Everlasting, and will be to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting:
Psal. 90. 2. <hi>Before the Mountains were
brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the Earth
and the World: even from everlasting, to everlasting,
thou art God.</hi> If there were a time when God
was not, then there was a time when nothing
was; and then there would never have been any
thing, unless nothing could make all things:
therefore God is eternally glorious, for whatever
is in God, is originally in himself, and absolutely
without dependance on any other, to everlasting.
How loosely do Honours sit upon Men? Every
Disease shakes them out of their Kingdom, Power,
and Glory; and within a little while the State,
Show, and all the Command of Earthly Kings will
fade away, and come to nothing. Governours
and Government may dye, Principalities grow
old and infirm, and sicken and dye, as well as
Princes; Kingdoms expire, like Kings, and they
like us. Psal. 82. 6, 7. <hi>I have said, ye are Gods,
and all of you are Children of the most High: But ye
shall dye like Men. But thy Throne, O God, is for
ever and ever.</hi> Psal. 45. 6. His Kingdom, and
Power, and Glory, they are without beginning,
and without end. Now this is also a ground of
Confidence and Dependance upon God. Earthly
Kings when they perish, their Favourites are
counted Offenders. 1 Kings 1. 21. <hi>When my Lord
the King shall sleep with his Fathers, that I and my
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:47528:267"/>
Son</hi> Solomon <hi>shall be counted Offenders.</hi> When o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Governours are set up, they and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
will be found Offenders. But our King lives
for ever, therefore this should encourage us to be
oftner in attendance upon God, performing it with
all Diligence and Seriousness, rather than court
the Humours and Lusts of earthly Potentates,
who die like one of the People, and leave us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the rage and wrath of others that do suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
them: But God is the same that ever he was,
to all those that ever called upon his Name. God
is where he was at first; <hi>I AM,</hi> is his Name; there
is no wrinkle upon the Brow of Eternity. <hi>His
Arm is not short, that it cannot save; or his Ear hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
that it cannot hear,</hi> Isa. 59. 1. Whatever he
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th been to his People that have called upon him
in former Ages, he is the same still. So, Isa. 51. 9.
<hi>Awake, awake, put on strength, O Arm of the Lord;
awake as in the ancient days, in the Generations of old:
Art thou not it that hath cut</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

he smote <hi>Rahab,</hi> and kill'd the Dragon
(meaning <hi>Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aoh);</hi> and God is the same God still,
his Kingdom, Power, and Glory are for ever;
and God will be your God too for evermore.
Look, as this doth encrease the terror of the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Hell, that they <hi>fall into the Hands of the living
God,</hi> Heb. 10. 31. God lives for ever to see Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
executed upon his Enemies: so it is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to have an interest in the living God, that
can and will keep you, and bring you to Heaven,
where you shall be with him for evermore: that
will ever live to see his Friends rewarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="518" facs="tcp:47528:268"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It directeth and regulateth our <hi>Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. It directs us as to the <hi>Object</hi> of Prayer;
to whom should we pray but to him that is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
and above controul? To God, and God alone,
not to Angels and Saints. To whom should we go
in our necessities, but to him that hath Dominion
over all things, and Power to dispose of them for
his own Glory? Will you think it a boldness to
go immediately to God? It were so, indeed if we
had not a Mediator: for a fallen Creature can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have the Impudence; and wicked Men that
have not got an Interest in Christ, cannot expect
Relief from God; but it is no Impudence to come
with a Mediator. Heb. 4. 16. <hi>Let us therefore come
boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and find Grace to help in time of need.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It directs us how to <hi>conceive</hi> of God in
Prayer; Right Thoughts of God in Prayer are
very necessary, and very difficult: no one thing
troubleth the Saints so much as this, how to fix
their thoughts in the apprehensions of God, when
they pray to him. Now here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s a direction how
we should look upon God: Look upon him as the
<hi>eternal</hi> Being, and <hi>first Cause,</hi> to whom belong
<hi>Kingdom, Power,</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> We cannot see God's
Essence, and therefore we must conceive of him
according to his Praises in the Word. Now take
but the <hi>Preface,</hi> and the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> and then you
have a full Description of God. Look upon him
as an <hi>Eternal Being,</hi> whose is the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Right to dispose of all things in the World,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:47528:268"/>
backed with All sufficiency and Strength: And look
upon him as your Father that is in Heaven; for,
<hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> relates to Christ,
that is in the heavenly Sanctuary, appearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God for us. This will help you in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of God, that you may not be puzled
nor intangled in Prayer.</p>
               <p>3. It directs us, as to the <hi>Manner</hi> of praying;
with Reverence, with Self-abhorrency, and with
Submission.</p>
               <p>(1.) With <hi>Reverence:</hi> for he is a great, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
and glorious King: <hi>Thine is the Kingdom,
Power, and Glory.</hi> O shall we serve God then in
a slight and careless Fashion! Mal. 1. 8. <hi>If ye of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Blind, the Lame and Sick for Sacrifice, is it
not evil? Offer it now unto thy Governour, will he be
pleased with thee, or accept thy Person? saith the
Lord of Hosts.</hi> Go to an Earthly King, would
you come to him with rude Addresses, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what to say, tumbling out Words without
Sence and Understanding. And compare this
with <hi>Vers.</hi> 14. saith God, when they brought him
a sickly Offering, <hi>I am a great King;</hi> implying,
it is a lessening of his Majesty. You do as it were
dethrone God, you put him besides his Kingdom,
you do not treat him as he doth deserve, if you
do not come into his presence with a holy Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
               <p>(2.) With <hi>Self-abhorrency,</hi> and a Sense of your
own Nothingness. I observe this, because all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
in Prayer are not taken <hi>from us,</hi> but
from what is <hi>in God,</hi> from his Attributes; <hi>Thine
is the Kingdom, Power, and Glory.</hi> It is a blessed
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:47528:269"/>
thing to have God's Attributes on our side; to
take an Argument from God, when we can take
none from our selves. Christ teacheth us to come
with Self-denial. The two first Words, <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>Power,</hi> shew that all things come from
God, as the first Cause; and the last Word, <hi>Thine
is the Glory,</hi> shews all must be referred to God, as
the last End: So that <hi>Self</hi> must be cast out. So
that all the Reasons of Audience and Acceptance
are without us, not from within us. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 8, 9.
<hi>To us belongeth Confusion of Face; to the Lord our
God belong Mercies and Forgivenesses.</hi> Therefore
thus it directs us to place all our Confidence in
God's fatherly Affection, in his Power, Goodness,
and Glory, and in his absolute Authority; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to move God from our selves.</p>
               <p>(3.) To come with <hi>Submission. Thine is the
Kingdom;</hi> that is, he hath an absolute Power to
dispose of all Blessings, therefore it is lawful for
him to do with his own as he pleaseth. We must
come, not murmuring or prescribing to God, but
expecting the fulfilling of our desires, as it shall
seem good to the Lord, according to his Wisdom
and Power, by which he exercises his Kingdom
over all Things, as may be for the Glory of his
Name. <hi>Psal. 115. 1. Not unto us, O Lord, not
unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory, for thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and for thy Truths sake.</hi> Not to satisfy our
Revenge, not to gratify our private Interest and
Passions; but, Lord, for thy Name-sake, as may
be for manifesting thy Mercy and Truth, so do
it: Not too passionate for our own Ends, but
confident that God, who hath the Kingdom and
Government of the World in his own hands, will
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:47528:269"/>
administer and carry on all Things for his own
Glory.</p>
               <p>4. It directs us again, what are the Duties of
the Persons praying.</p>
               <p>(1.) Freely to resign up our selves to God's
Service. Otherwise we mock God, when we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his Dominion over all the World, and
we our selves will not be made subject to God.
Therefore certainly a Man that useth this Prayer,
<hi>Thine is the Kingdom, Power, and Glory,</hi> will also
say, <hi>I am thine, save me.</hi> Psal. 119. 94. Let us
freely resign up our selves for him to reign over
us. Can you say with any face to God, <hi>Thine is
the Kingdom,</hi> yet cherish rebellious Lusts in your
own Hearts? It's the most unsuitable thing that
can be. <hi>Thine is the Power;</hi> He is able to bear you
out in his Work, however the World rage. And
therefore we should not think scorn of his Service,
for <hi>his is the Glory:</hi> The Service of such a King
will put honour upon you.</p>
               <p>(2.) Another Duty of him that is to pray, is to
<hi>depend</hi> upon God's <hi>All-sufficiency.</hi> Shall we speak
thus of God, and say, <hi>Lord, Thine is the Power,</hi>
and yet not rely upon him? He that cannot rely
upon him for this Life and the other, doth but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
God, when he saith, <hi>Thine is the Power;</hi>
Thine is the Power, yet I will not trust thee, but
fly to base Shifts, as if the Creature had Power, and
Man had Power, as if they could better provide
for us then God. Therefore we are to live upon
him, and cast our selves into the Arms of his All-sufficiency.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="522" facs="tcp:47528:270"/>
(3.) Another Duty of them that would pray
this Prayer, is, sincerely to aim at and seek the
Lord's Glory in all things; Why? for <hi>the Glory is
thine.</hi> Wilt thou say, <hi>Thine is the Glory,</hi> and yet
give and take the Glory which is due to God, to
thy sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? All is due to him, from whom we have
received all things. But he that prides himself in
Gifts and Graces, cannot be in good earnest. Wilt
thou rob God of the Honour, and wear it thy
self? Did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en believe all Glory belongs to God,
they would not take Vain-glory to themselves.
<hi>Hero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> was eloquent, and the People cried out,
<hi>The Voice of a God, and not of a Man:</hi> He did
but receive this Applause, and usurped the Glory
due to God, and God blasted him. Therefore
when we pride our selves in our Sufficiencies, and
abuse our Comforts to our own Lusts, we cannot
with a good Conscience say, <hi>Thine is the Glory.</hi>

Rev. 3. 14. <hi>Thus saith the</hi> Amen, <hi>the faithful
and true Witness, the beginning of the Creation of
God.</hi> Sometimes it is taken <hi>Adverbially,</hi> and so it
signifieth <hi>Verily,</hi> and <hi>Truly;</hi> and so either it may
express a great Asseveration, or an affectionate
Desire. Sometimes it expresseth a great and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>veration,</hi> John 6. 47. <hi>Amen, Amen,
Verily, Verily, I say unto you.</hi> In other places it is
put for an affectionate <hi>Desire; Ier.</hi> 28. 6. When
the false Prophets prophesied Peace, and <hi>Ieremiah</hi>
pronounced War, <hi>Amen! the Lord do so, the
Lord perform thy Words which thou hast prophesied.
Amen,</hi> 'tis not an Asseveration, as confirming the
Truth of their Prophecy, but expressing his own
hearty wish and desire, if God saw it good.</p>
               <p>Two things are required in Prayer; a fervent
Desire, and Faith. <hi>A fervent Desire;</hi> therefore it
is said, James 5. 16. <hi>The effectual fervent Prayer of
a righteous Man availeth much.</hi> And then, <hi>Faith,</hi>
James 1. 6. <hi>But let him ask in Faith, nothing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering.</hi>
What's that Faith required in Prayer?
A Persuasion that those things we ask regularly
according to God's Will, that God will grant
them for Christ's Sake. Now both these <hi>Amen</hi>
                  <pb n="524" facs="tcp:47528:272"/>
signifies: our hearty <hi>desire</hi> that it may be so; and
our <hi>Faith</hi> (that is) our Acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>scency in the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Power, and Wisdom of God concerning
the Event.</p>
               <p>Christ would have us bind up this Prayer, and
conclude it thus, <hi>Amen,</hi> so let it be, so it shall
be. Observe hence,</p>
               <p>That it is good to conclude holy Exercises with
some Vigour and Warmth.</p>
               <p>Natural Motion is swifter in the end and close:
So should our spiritual Affections, as we draw to
a conclusion, put forth the Efficacy of Faith and
holy Desires, and recollect as it were all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Affections; that we may go out of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God with a sweet Savour and Relish, and
a renewed Confidence in his Mercy and Power.</p>
               <p>Again, This <hi>Amen</hi> relateth to all the foregoing
Petitions, not to one only. Many when they hear,
<hi>Lord, Give us this day our daily Bread,</hi> will say
<hi>Amen;</hi> but when they come to the Petition, <hi>Thy
Will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cold there, and have not hearty Desires and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Affections. Many beg <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>Sin;</hi> but to
be kept from <hi>Evil,</hi> to bridle and restrain their
Souls from Sin, they do not say <hi>Amen</hi> to that.
Many would have Defence, Maintenance, and
Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tory over their Enemies; but not with respect
to God's Glory: They forget that Petition, <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
be thy Name,</hi> but this should be subordinated
to his Glory. Nay we must say <hi>Amen</hi> to all the
Clauses of this Prayer. Many say, <hi>Lord, Forgive
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:47528:272"/>
us our Debts,</hi> but do not like that, <hi>as we forgive our
Debtors;</hi> they are loth to forgive their Enemies,
but carry a rancorous Mind to them which have
done them wrong. But now we must say <hi>Amen</hi>
to all that is specified in this Prayer. Then,</p>
               <p>Mark, This <hi>Amen</hi> it is put in the close of the
Doxology. Observe hence,</p>
               <p>There must be a hearty <hi>Amen</hi> to our Praises, as
well as our Prayers; that we may shew zeal for
God's Glory, as well as Affection to our Profit.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Allelujahs</hi> should sound as loud as your
Supplications, and not only say <hi>Amen</hi> when you
come with Prayers and Requests, things you
stand in need of; but <hi>Amen,</hi> when you are praising
of God.</p>
