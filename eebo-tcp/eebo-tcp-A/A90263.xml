            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was with Thoughts of <hi>Peace,</hi> that I embraced my <hi>Call,</hi> to this Place, and Time of <hi>Warre.</hi> As all <hi>Peace</hi> that is from God is precious to my ſpirit, ſo incomparably, that between the Father &amp; his Elect, which is eſtabliſhed, and carried on in the Blood and Grace of Jeſus Chriſt. The Miniſteriall diſpenſation of this <hi>Peace,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through free Grace committed even unto me alſo, I deſire that in every place, my <hi>whole</hi> may be, to declare it to the men of Gods good pleaſure. That this was my chief deſign, in anſwer to the <hi>Call</hi> of God upon me, even to poure out a ſavour of the Goſpel upon the <hi>Sons of Peace</hi> in this place, I hope is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to the Conſciences of all, with whom (ſince my coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) in the Work of the Miniſtery I have had to do. The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> between God and us, began on our Part: The <hi>Peace</hi> which he hath made, begins and ends with himſelf. This is the way of God with ſinners, when he might juſtly continue their <hi>Enemy,</hi> and <hi>fight</hi> againſt <hi>them</hi> to their Eternal ruine, he drawes forth Love, and beſeeches <hi>them</hi> to be reconciled, who have done the wrong, and <hi>them</hi> to accept of <hi>Peace,</hi> who cannot abide the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.</hi> Certainly, the bearing forth of this Meſsage, which is ſo <hi>worthy of all Acceptation,</hi> and ought to be ſo welcome, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have ſweetnes enough to ſeaſon all the Preſſures and temptations wherewith it is ſomtimes attended. This hath bin my deſire to purſue, and that, with the <hi>weapons</hi> which are not carnal. And though ſome may be ſo ſeaſoned with the leaven of contention about carnal things, or at beſt the <hi>tithing of Mint and Cummin,</hi> as to diſreliſh the weightier things of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, yet the great Owner of the Vineyard, hath not left me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:115349:3"/>
a comfortable aſſurance, that even <hi>this labour in the Lord hath not been in vain.</hi> The following Sermons, which I deſire to preſent unto your <hi>Excellency,</hi> were preached one at <hi>Berwick</hi> upon your first advance into <hi>Scotland;</hi> the other at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> My willingnes to ſerve the Inheritance of Chriſt here, even in my <hi>Ablence,</hi> cauſed me to cloſe with the deſires, that wercheld out to this purpoſe. And I do preſent them to your <hi>Excellency,</hi> not only becauſe the Riſe of my <hi>Call</hi> to this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, under God was from you; but alſo, becauſe in the carrying of it on, I have received from you in the weakneſſes and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations wherewith I am encompaſſed, that dayly ſpirituall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment and ſupport by inquiry into, and diſcovery of the deep and hidden diſpenſations of God towards his ſecret ones, which my ſpirit is taught to value. The carrying on of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Lord Jeſus amongſt his <hi>Saints,</hi> in all his wayes, which are Truth and Righteouſneſse, the matter pointed at in this Diſcourſe, being the Ayme of your ſpirit in your great under-takings it bears another Reſpect unto you. I am not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with it's meanneſſe yea it's coming ſhort in reſpect of uſe and fruit, of what the Lord hath ſince, and by others drawn forth; but ſuch as it is, having by Providence ſtepped firſt into the world, I wholly commend it to him for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, who graciouſly <hi>ſupplyed the ſeed to the ſower:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him that we may have <hi>joy unſpeakable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> in the Acceptance of that Peace, which he gives us in the Son of his Love, whileſt the Peace whoſe deſire in the midſt of warre, you continually bear forth to him, and to others, is by them rejected to their hurt.</p>

That Which <hi>Paul</hi> laid <hi>miniſterially, God</hi> himſelf laid <hi>primarily</hi> and <hi>efficiently: Thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold I lay in Sion for a Foundation a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a precious Corner ſtone, a ſure Foundation, Iſa.</hi> 28. 16.

            <p n="2">2. A <hi>Foundation</hi> onely will not make a <hi>Houſe,</hi> there muſt alſo be <hi>Materials</hi> for a <hi>ſuperstrustion:</hi> Thoſe you have, 1. <hi>Pet. 2. 5. you are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>lively ſtones:</hi> All Gods Elect, are ſtones, in due time to be hewed,

and fitted for this building. For</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ye are built upon the Foundation of the Prophets, and the Apoſtles, Jeſus Christ himſelf being the chief corner ſtone, in whom the whole building fitly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med together, groweth into an holy Temple in the Lord: in whom alſo ye are builded together, for an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation to God by the ſpirit, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>There is much ſpirituall and heavenly Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in theſe 3. verſes. I ſhall onely touch on ſome particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Foundation of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> this Temple is laid, and that is Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>other Foundation can no man lay:</hi> He is here called, <hi>the chief corner ſtone:</hi> and, <hi>the Foundation of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> It is not which they were, but which they laid: It is <hi>Genetivus efficiculis,</hi> not <hi>materiae:</hi> That expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion holds out, the <hi>perſons working,</hi> not the <hi>thing wrought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Materials</hi> of this Building, Elect, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: ſaid in the former verſe, to be <hi>fellow citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God:</hi> they alone are built on Chriſt, and thereby have union with him: not one dead rotten ſtone in all this Building, as ſhall be declared.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Architects</hi> or builders are of two ſorts:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Principall,</hi> the Spirit, <hi>we are framed to an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for God by the Spirit:</hi> He is the principall Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in this Fabrick: without him, is not one ſtone laid therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115349:6"/>
2. <hi>Secundary</hi> and Inſtrumentall, the Prophets and Apoſtles, and this they were two wayes:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Perſonally,</hi> in their ſeverall Generations: this was their work, their labour, to lay the Foundation, and carry on the building of this Houſe.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Doctrinally:</hi> ſo they labour in it to this very day: Their Doctrine in the Scripture holds out the onely Foundation, and the onely way of building thereon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>manner of the building,</hi> it is <hi>fitly framed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>

               <hi>the head, from which, all the Body by joynts and hands having nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment miniſtred, and knit together, increaſeth with the increaſe of God. Col</hi> 2. 19.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>What kind a Houſe</hi> it is: It receiveth here a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Title, 1. an holy Temple: 2. an habitation, or a Tabernacle, becauſe of it's alluſion to both thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places of the worſhip of God, fulfilling the Types of them both.</p>
            <p>Hence it is moſt evident that this Church of Chriſt is a Houſe, and being appropriated unto God, God's Houſe.</p>
            <p>To make this the more evident, I ſhall do theſe two things:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Shew you what are the chief <hi>Properties</hi> of this Houſe.</item>
               <item>2. Declare what is the <hi>Relation,</hi> wherein Jeſus Chriſt ſtands to this Houſe, having called it all along the Church of Chriſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. For the Properties or chief qualities of this Houſe, they are three: 1. It is a <hi>living</hi> Houſe: 2. it is <hi>ſtrong:</hi> 3. it is <hi>glorious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115349:6"/>
1 It is a <hi>living</hi> Houſe: <hi>Unto whom coming as unto a living ſtone, yee alſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpirituall Houſe,</hi> 1 Pet: 2: 4: 5. Chriſt the <hi>foundation</hi> is a <hi>living Stone,</hi> and they that are built upon him, are living ſtones. Hence they are ſaid to <hi>grow together</hi> into an Houſe: Growth is a ſigne of life: Growing from an inward Principle: ſuch as the <hi>Growth</hi> of any thing is, ſuch is its <hi>life:</hi> the Groweth of this Houſe is ſpirituall, ſo therefore alſo is its life: it lives with a ſpirituall life: a life whoſe fulneſſe, is in its foundation, he hath life in himſelf: <hi>Joh:</hi> 5. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from him, in them: <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt: nevertheleſſe I live,</hi> Gal: 2: 22: <hi>yea it is himſelf</hi> in them; <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> It is true thoſe ſtones are dead in the Rock as well as others: by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Children of wrath as well as they,</hi> Epheſ. 2: 3: being <hi>dead in Treſpaſſes and ſins:</hi> v: 1. He who Hews them our, gives them life: He <hi>quickens them, when dead in treſpaſſes and ſin:</hi> There is not one rotten dead ſtone in all this building: However ſome ſuch may, by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their outward appearance, croud in, yet they are not of the Houſe it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is <hi>a ſtrong</hi> Houſe: the <hi>Gates of Hell cannot prevail againſt it,</hi> Mat. 1. 6: 18. though the Rain deſcend, and the floods come, and the winds blow, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Houſe, yet it will not fall, becauſe it is founded on a Rock, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 25. We were all once an houſe built upon <hi>Adam:</hi> and when the winde came, and beat upon us, we fell, and the fall of that houſe was very great: He in his beſt eſtate was found to be but ſand: now we are built upon a Rock that will abid all trialls: The waves may make a noiſe and daſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt him, but it will be to their own ruine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:115349:7"/>
But you will ſay, may not weak and inconſiſtent mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials be built upon a Rock, which yet may have never the more ſtrength for their firme foundation? <hi>Anſ</hi> 1: It is not ſo here, for the whole building is framed together in the foundation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 22. not only <hi>on</hi> it, but alſo <hi>in</hi> it, and ſo not to be prevailed againſt, unleſſe the Rock it ſelf be orethrown. 2. It is a living Rock, that this houſe is built on: a Rock continually communicating ſtrength unto every ſtone in the building, that it may be inabled to abide in him: I ſhould proceed too for, ſhould I goe to declare the mighty defence and fortification of this Houſe: what hath been ſpoken from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, is enough to demonſtrate it to be <hi>a ſtrong Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>Glorious</hi> Houſe, and that in a three-fold reſpect:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is Glorious in reſpect of <hi>Inward</hi> Glory brought unto it of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt: being beautifull, through the comlineſſe that he puts upon it: Hence Chriſt ſpeaking of it, ſays, <hi>How faire art thou O love for delights, Canticles,</hi> 7: 6. and thou art all fair my love, there is no ſpot in thee, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4 7. and how I pray comes that about, why Chriſt waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in his own blood, that it might be wholly a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26 27. And further he being the branch of the Lord, and fruit of the earth is made beauty and Glory, Excellency and Comlineſſe thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
            <p>It hath the beauty and Glory of Juſtification, which doth not only take away all filthy Garments, cauſing Iniquity to paſſe away, but alſo gives fair change of Rayment, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 4, 5. even the Garments of Salvation, and the Robe of Righteouſneſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 10. And then
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115349:7"/>
it hath, the Glory, and beauty of ſanctification, whence the Kings daughter is all Glorious within, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 13. The comlineſſe and beauty that is in a ſanctified ſoul, is above all the Glory of the world. This Houſe is all overlaid with gold within: Chriſt is unto it a Head of Gold, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 11. His houſe is not like <hi>Nebucadnezers</hi> Image, that the Head ſhould be of Gold, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſome of them of Clay: they all partake of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are very glorious therein:</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reſpect of its outward ſtructure; which it emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently hath in all the peculiar Aſſemblies thereof: O thou afflicted and toſſed with tempeſt and not comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, behold I will lay thy ſtones with faire Colours, and thy foundations with ſaphires: <hi>I</hi> will make thy win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of Agats and Carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleaſant ſtones, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54, 11, 12. So alſo where it is called the new Hieruſalem, (a city from its laws and policie) this city is ſaid to be of pure Gold, (not droſſe and mire) the building of the wall of Iaſper, and the foundation of the wall garniſhed with all manner of precious ſtones, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 18. 19. This is that which the Pſalmiſt calls the beauties of Holineſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Glory of the Ordinances of the Goſpell in their vigour and puritie: There is nothing ſo glorious as our King on his throne: Chriſt in his Court; this Houſe, raigning in the Adminiſtration of his Ordinances: then al his Garments, ſmel of Mirrh, Aloes and Caſſia, out of the Ivory Pallaces whereby they have made him Glad, Kings daughters are among his honorable women, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his right hand doth ſtand the Queen in Gold of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 8, 9. His goings are ſeene, the goings of our God and King in the ſanctuary, <hi>Pſal. 68. 24, 25. &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle exalteth the Glory of Goſpel-Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115349:8"/>
exceeding above the old Tabernacle and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple worſhip, which yet was excreeding pompous and glorious. If (ſaith he) the miniſt ation of death, written &amp; engraven in ſtones was glorious, ſo that the Children of Iſrael could not ſtedfaſtly behold the face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the Glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away, How ſhall not the the miniſtration of the ſpirit be rather glorious: For if the miniſtration of Condemnation be Glory, much more doth the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Righteouſneſſe exceed in Glory: For even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory that excelleth, for if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth is glorious, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Let men think as meanly as they pleaſe of the ſpirituall ſervice of God amongſt his people: All Glory that ever yet appeared in the world, was but a buble to it: all that God ever Inſtituted before, came exceeding ſhort of it: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in it, who beholds the proud afar off.</p>
            <p>3 It is glorious in reſpect of the Exaltation it hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and Triumph over all its oppoſers: To ſee a Houſe, a Pallace hanged round about with Enſignes, Spoyles, and banners taken from the Enemy that have come againſt it, is a Glorious thing: thus is this Houſe of God decked: Kings of Armyes did flee apace, and ſhee that caried at home, devided the ſpoyle, Pſal: 68. 12. ſhe that ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies at home, the mother of the family, the Church of God, ſhee hath all the ſpoyles. The Lord hath affirmed, that not onely every one that oppoſeth, but all that do not ſerve this houſe, ſhall be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, Iſa. 60: 12. There you have the ſpoyle of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> and all his Hoſt, gathered on the ſhore of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115349:8"/>
red ſea, and dedicated in this Houſe, Exod: 15. There you have the Robes of <hi>Nebuehadnezzar</hi> here referred when himſelf was turned into a Beaſt, <hi>Dan</hi> 34. There you have the imperiall Ornaments of <hi>Diocleſiar,</hi> and his companion caſting aſide their dominion for very madnes that they could not prevail againſt this houſe: There is the blood of <hi>Julian</hi> kept for a monument of Vengeance againſt Apoſtates: There you have the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets of the Prelates of this land, hung up of late with other Garments of their adherents rolled in blood: There is a place reſerved for the remaining ſpoyls of the great whore, when ſhee ſhall be burned and made naked, and deſolate <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. never any roſe, or ſhall ariſe againſt this houſe, and go forth unto finall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity: Let the men of the world take heed how they burthen themſelves with the foundation ſtone of this houſe, it will aſſuredly break them all in pieces.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given you a Glimpſe of this houſe, with the chief properties of it, which as God aſſumes as his owne, ſo alſo peculiarly it belongs unto the Lord Chriſt; yea what Relation it ſtands in unto him, or rather he unto it, is the maine thing I intend.</p>

thereof:</p>
            <p>I ſhall paſſe through theſe (God aſſiſting) in Order: &amp; begin with what was firſt laid down, His Relation to this Houſe in reſpect of its fabrick and building; as 1 The foundation of it: This was in part declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for: He is the ſtone which the builders rejected, but made of the Lord the head of the Corner, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 22. He is the loweſt in the bottom to beare up the weight of the building, and the Higheſt in the Corner to Couple the whole together: other foundation can no man lay but that which is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. He is the Rock, on which he builds his Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18.</p>
            <p>Now there be 3. things, required to a Foundation, all which are eminently ſeen in the Lord Chriſt, in Reference to this Houſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it be <hi>firſt</hi> laid in the Building: It were a courſe exceeding prepoſterous, <hi>firſt</hi> to build a Houſe, and <hi>then</hi> to lay the Foundation. Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>firſt</hi> that is laid in this holy fabrick: and that in a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Reſpect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is the <hi>firſt,</hi> in reſpect of God's <hi>eternall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:</hi> The Lord purpoſed that <hi>he ſhould have the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence</hi> in this as well as <hi>in all</hi> other <hi>things, Col.</hi> 1. 15. He is in that Reſpect <hi>the firſt born among many Brethren
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115349:9"/>
Rom.</hi> 8. 29. the Reſidue of this Houſe, being <hi>predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to be made conformable unto him: He is before all things, by him all things,</hi> (that is all ſpirituall things, all the things of this Houſe) <hi>conſiſt, He is the Head of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the Church:</hi> this I mean, God purpoſed that Chriſt ſhould be the bottom and foundation of this whole building, that it ſhould be all laid on him: I do not mean, that God firſt intended Chriſt for a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then his Elect for a building. The order of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Execution is as to firſt, and laſt, inverted by all Agents: but this I ſay, God purpoſing to build his Elect into an holy Temple, purpoſed that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be the Foundation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Reſpect of <hi>outward manifestation:</hi> God firſt manifeſts and declares him, before he layd one ſtone in this building, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. The ſeed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the woman ſhall break the ſerpents Head:</hi> in that was laid the firſt ſtone of this building: then was the <hi>Lamb ſlain,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe <hi>in order of Nature,</hi> Chriſt muſt be firſt laid in the Heart of every Individuall ſtone, before they are laid up in this building. If Chriſt be not in men, they are <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="4">4. In reſpect of every <hi>particular Aſſembly,</hi> and <hi>little Sanctuary of Mount Sion:</hi> If he be not firſt laid in the midſt of ſuch Aſſemblies, they will prove to be <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>acles</hi> of <hi>Babel,</hi> not <hi>Towres</hi> of <hi>Sion:</hi> This therefore was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115349:10"/>
the way of the Saints of old, firſt <hi>to give up themſelves to the Lord Chriſt, and then to one another, by the will of God, 2. Cor.</hi> 8. 5.</p>
            <p>In theſe Reſpects Chriſt the Foundation, is firſt laid in this ſpirituall building: which is the <hi>first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> of a Foundation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Foundation muſt be <hi>hidden, and out of ſight</hi> unto all thoſe that outwardly look upon the Houſe: They cannot perceive it, though every part of the Houſe doth reſt upon it: And this hath occaſioned many miſtakes in the World. An unwiſe man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a great Houſe, ſeeing the <hi>Anticks</hi> and <hi>Pictures</hi> ſtand crouching under the Windows and ſides of the Houſe, may happily think, that they bear up the weight of the Houſe, when indeed they are for the moſt part pargetted Poſts; they bear not the Houſe, the Houſe bears them. By their bowing and <hi>outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,</hi> the Man thinks the Burden is on them, and ſuppoſes, that it would be an eaſie thing, at any time, by taking them away, to demoliſh the Houſe it ſelf; But, when hee ſets himſelf to work, hee findes theſe things of no value, there is a Foundation in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, which bears up the whole, that he thought not of: againſt that, hee may waſte himſelf, untill hee be broken in pieces.</p>
            <p>Men looking upon the Church, do finde that it is a fair Fabrick indeed, but cannot imagine how it ſhould ſtand. A few ſupporters it ſeemeth to have in the world, like <hi>crouching Anticks</hi> under the Windowes, that make ſome ſhew of under-propping it: Here you have a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> there an <hi>Army,</hi> or ſo: think the men of the world, can we but remove theſe <hi>props,</hi> the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115349:10"/>
whole would quickly topple to the ground: Yea, ſo fooliſh have I been my ſelf; and ſo void of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before the Lord, as to take a View of ſome good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appearing Props of this building, and to think, how ſhall the Houſe be preſerved if theſe ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: they looked unto me, like the Mariners in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſhip without whoſe abode therein, they could not be ſaved: when lo, ſuddainly ſome have been manifeſted to be pargetted Poſts, and the very beſt, to be <hi>held up by the Houſe,</hi> and not to <hi>hold it up.</hi>

            <p>On this Account, the men of the world, think it no great matter to demoliſh the ſpirituall Church of Chriſt to the Ground: they encourage one another to the work, never thinking of the Foundation that lyes hidden, againſt which they daſh themſelves all to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I ſay then, Chriſt as the Foundation of this Houſe, is hidden to the men of the World, they ſee it not, they believe it not: there is nothing more remote from their Apprehenſion, then that Chriſt ſhould be at the bottom of them and their ways, whom they ſo much deſpiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Foundation is that which <hi>beares up the whole weight of the Building.</hi> What part of the Houſe ſoever, is not directly poyſed upon it, hath no ſtrength at all: take a goodly ſtone, hew it, ſquare it, make it every way fit for your <hi>Fabrick,</hi> ſo that it may ſeem to be the beſt of all your <hi>Materials;</hi> yet if you do not lay it upon the <hi>Foundation,</hi> anſwerable to that, which may give it a ſolid <hi>Baſis,</hi> and bear up the weight and poyſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it will be uſeleſſe, comberſome, and quickly fall to the Ground.</p>
            <p>Let a man be hewed and ſquared by the Word and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115349:11"/>
ordinances into outward conformity, never ſo exactly, that he ſeems one of the moſt beautifull Saints in the World, yet if he be not laid rightly by Faith upon the <hi>Foundation,</hi> to derive from thence, ſtrength, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and vigour, he will quickly fall to the ground: What then will become of their building, who heap up all ſorts of <hi>rubbiſh</hi> to make an <hi>Houſe</hi> for the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt is the <hi>Ark</hi> of this Houſe: The <hi>Ark</hi> in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and afterwards in the <hi>Temple,</hi> was the moſt <hi>holy thing,</hi> in the moſt <hi>holy Place.</hi> There was nothing in it but the <hi>two Tables</hi> of ſtone written with the Fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God: before it was <hi>Aarons Rod</hi> that budded, with a <hi>Pot</hi> full of <hi>Manna:</hi> over it was the <hi>Propitiatory</hi> or <hi>Mercy ſeat,</hi> being a plate of Gold, as long and asbroad as the <hi>Ark,</hi> covering it, being ſhadowed with the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims</hi> of <hi>Glory.</hi> Now all this <hi>glorious Fabrick,</hi> did ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that unleſſe the <hi>Law</hi> with its condemning power were hid in the <hi>Ark,</hi> and covered with the <hi>Mercy ſeat,</hi> no perſon could ſtand before the Lord: Beſides, the Law was the <hi>old Covenant of works,</hi> and being renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them chiefly to be ſubſervient to the Goſpel, and partly with its <hi>Appurtenances</hi> and <hi>carnall Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi> to be the tenour of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> holding the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and this being in the <hi>Ark,</hi> it was ſaid to contain the Covenant, and is frequently called the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>Ark</hi> of this ſpirituall <hi>Houſe.</hi> When the <hi>Temple was opened in Heaven, there was ſeen in the Temple the Ark of Gods Teſtament, Revel.</hi> 11. 10. Jeſus Chriſt made conſpicuous to all, who lay much hid under the old Teſtament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. God is ſaid <hi>to ſet forth Chriſt</hi> to be <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>1. In behalf of this <hi>Houſe</hi> and every ſtone thereof, he <hi>hides the Law with its condemning power,</hi> that nothing from thence ſhal be laid to their charge. If a man have a ſuit to be tryed in any Court, and a powerful Friend engage himſelf, that the <hi>only Evidence</hi> which is againſt him, ſhall not be produced, will it not give him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to proceed? In that great and tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous tryal, which is to be above, there is but one <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Evidence</hi> againſt us, which gives li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to all others, which if it be removed, all the reſt muſt fail. This is the Law: Chriſt as the <hi>Ark</hi> and <hi>Mercy ſeat</hi> hides this <hi>Law:</hi> it ſhall not (I ſpeak in reſpect to this <hi>Houſe)</hi> be produced at the day of tryall: will it not be a great encouragement to them to appear at the Throne of God? Chriſt hides the Law as being the End of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. that the <hi>Righteouſneſſe thereof might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi> in us, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 4. He hath ſo far anſwered all that the Law required, that none from thence can <hi>lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect, Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. Let not poor ſinners fear; it will not be with them as with <hi>Uzzah:</hi> He touched the Ark, and died: Touch this Ark, and live for ever.</p>
            <p>And 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, he is the Ark of this Houſe, as containing in himſelf the New Covenant; it is made with him, originally: eſtabliſhed in him, irreverſibly; made out through him in all the grace of it, faithfully.</p>

and 30.

place of the Tabernacle, you have <hi>Exod.</hi> 25 31. &amp;c. It was one of the moſt glorious <hi>Utenſils</hi> of that frame: made of <hi>pure and beaten Gold,</hi> with much variety of works, knops, flowres and lamps. The <hi>Uſe</hi> of it was to bear out <hi>light,</hi> for all the worſhip of God in that moſt Holy Place. The <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was made cloſe, without any window: It was not to receive <hi>light</hi> from <hi>without:</hi> It had all its own light from within. It is true, this <hi>Candleſtick</hi> with its 7. lamps, did ſecundarily repreſent the <hi>Churches of Chriſt,</hi> which hold out his light among themſelves, and unto others, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. laſt: <hi>the ſeven Candleſticks thou ſaweſt are the ſeven Churches:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Solomon</hi> made <hi>ten Candleſticks of pure Gold, 1. Kings</hi> 7. 49. to ſet out yet further the Increaſe &amp; multiplying of the Churches of God. Upon this account alſo, the <hi>two witneſſes</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>two Candleſticks, Rev.</hi> 11. 4. And, <hi>the two anointed ones that ſtand before the God of the whole Earth, Zech.</hi> 4. 3. Whence that in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> is taken, there is mention indeed of <hi>two Anointed ones,</hi> but of <hi>one Candleſtick:</hi> the Holy Ghoſt plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, that though the <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of Chriſt are alſo <hi>Candleſticks</hi> in a ſecond ſenſe, yet there is one Eminent <hi>Candleſtick</hi> which hath light original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it ſelf, which alſo it communicates unto all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And this is that which is mentioned in <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. which hath the <hi>two Olive Trees,</hi> or the two Anointed Churches of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſtanding by it, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving light from it, to communicate to others: <hi>they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty the Golden</hi> oyle out of themſelves, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the <hi>Candleſtick.</hi> For this <hi>Candleſtick</hi> hath <hi>ſeven lamps,</hi> v. 2. which <hi>lamps</hi> that burn before the throne, are the <hi>ſeven ſpirits of God, Rev. 4. 5. ſeven ſpirits</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:115349:13"/>
that is, the perfection and compleatneſſe of the Spirit of God, in all his Graces and Operations. Now who hath theſe ſeven ſpirits? Even he <hi>who received not the ſpirit by meaſure, Joh.</hi> 3. 34. being the ſtone upon which are the ſeven Eyes, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 9. He alone then is this <hi>Candleſtick,</hi> and all the <hi>light</hi> which this <hi>Houſe</hi> hath, it is from him.</p>
            <p>There are two wayes whereby Jeſus Chriſt makes out light to this Houſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of <hi>Doctrinall Revelation: 2. Of Reall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. He alone diſcovers <hi>light</hi> to all the <hi>Stones of this Building. No man hath ſeen God at any time: the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son which is in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared him Joh</hi> 1. 10. No ſaving diſcovery of God, of his Nature, his Will, his Love, but what is by Chriſt. The Moon and Starres give <hi>light,</hi> but it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what they receive from the Sun. The Prophets and Apoſtles, held out <hi>light,</hi> but it was all received from him. They <hi>ſpake by the ſpirit of Chriſt that was in them I have received of the Lord that which I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto you, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 23. The ſame Apoſtle <hi>curſes</hi> every one that ſhall bring in any <hi>other light</hi> into this <hi>Houſe,</hi> be they Angels or Men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt alone fully knowes the minde of God, as being alwayes in the <hi>boſome of his Father, Joh:</hi> 1. 18. Yea he knowes it to the uttermoſt, being <hi>one with his Father, Joh.</hi> 10: 30. And he is willing to reveal it, for even <hi>for this end came he into the world, that he might bear witneſſe to the truth.</hi> And he had Ability enough to do it, for <hi>in him were hid all Treaſure of wiſdome and knowledge, Col.</hi> 2. 3. He alone is the Author of all light to this his holy Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:115349:13"/>
Many Attempts have been to ſet up <hi>light</hi> in this <hi>Houſe,</hi> and not from Chriſt. Some would <hi>kindle</hi> their <hi>Traditions</hi> or the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of this <hi>Houſe:</hi> Some their <hi>Prudentials</hi> for the <hi>Government</hi> of it: Some their <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonials</hi> for the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of it: All <hi>Candles</hi> in the Sun. Shall men think to compaſle themſelves with ſparks, and walk in the light of the fire which themſelves have kindled, in the face of the Sun of Righteouſnes? ſhall not ſuch men ly down in ſorrow? Beloved, take heed of ſuch <hi>ignes fatui,</hi> fooliſh miſguiding fires.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of Reall Communication, <hi>He is the true light which lightneth everyman, Joh.</hi> 1. 9. Every one that hath any ſpirituall light really communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, hath it from Chriſt. It is part of his work to <hi>recover ſight to the blind, Luke</hi> 4. 18. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he adviſeth the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> to come to <hi>him for eye ſalve,</hi> that ſhe might ſee, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 18. At his coming, <hi>Sion ſhines forth, Iſa</hi> 60. 1. becauſe his <hi>light ariſeth upon her,</hi> v. 2. The former <hi>Doctrinall Teaching</hi> of it ſelf w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll not ſuffice. That <hi>light may ſhine in darknes,</hi> and <hi>the darknes not comprehend it, Joh.</hi> 1. 5. All the <hi>light:</hi> the Sun can give, will not make a blind man ſee. There muſt be a <hi>viſive faculty</hi> within, as well as light without: The <hi>Stones</hi> of this <hi>building</hi> are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all blind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea darkned, yea darkneſſe it ſelf. If the Lord Chriſt do not by the mighty efficacy of his ſpirit <hi>create</hi> a viſive Power within them, as well as <hi>reveal</hi> the will of his Father to them, they will never ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcern the things of God. <hi>The naturall man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth not the things of God, nor indeed can do, 1. Cor.</hi> 2 14.</p>
            <p>It is true, men by the help of <hi>Common Gifts,</hi> with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115349:14"/>
the uſe of the former <hi>Doctrinall Revelation,</hi> may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ſuch a knowledge of the mind of God, as may in a ſenſe be called <hi>Illumination, Heb. 6. 4. Far</hi> may they go <hi>much</hi> may they do, by this light. They may <hi>teach others,</hi> and be <hi>caſt away</hi> themſelves: They may diſpute for Truth, yea dye for Truth, and all this while have but the <hi>firſt common Anointing,</hi> ſee nothing clearly, but, <hi>Menwalking like Trees.</hi> A ſpiritual <hi>Inſight</hi> into the mind of God, is not to be obtained, without an Almighty Act of the Spirit of Chriſt, creating a new power of Life, and Light upon the Soul.</p>
            <p>Some indeed think that they have this <hi>ſeeing Power</hi> in themſelves. Do but ſhew them <hi>outwaraly</hi> what is to be ſeen, and let them alone for the diſcerning of it. Well then, let them alone, if ever they are <hi>ſtones</hi> of this living <hi>Houſe,</hi> I am deceived. Thou that art ſo, know whence is all thy <hi>light:</hi> and if thou art any thing in the <hi>dark,</hi> draw nigh to the <hi>Candlestick,</hi> from whence all light is: Thence muſt thy light come, yea and thence it ſhall come: the ſecrets of the Lord ſhall make their abode with thee.</p>
            <p>And this is the fourfold Relation wherein the Lord Chriſt ſtands unto this <hi>Houſe,</hi> as it is a Spirituall building.</p>
            <p>In Reſpect of <hi>State and Condition,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ſtands in a fivefold Relation to this Houſe: which I ſhall unfold in order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is the <hi>Owner</hi> of it. He cals it HIS. <hi>Upon this Rock will I build my Church, Math. 16 18 Moſes</hi> was faithfull in all &amp;c. but Chriſt as a ſon over his OWN Houſe, whoſe Houſe are we, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 4, 5. And that you may ſee that he doth not <hi>owne</hi> it as <hi>His,</hi> without good
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115349:14"/>
               <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title,</hi> know that in the great <hi>Oeconomie</hi> of Grace, Jeſus Chriſt hath a threefold <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to this Houſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of <hi>Inheritance, He is</hi> by his Father <hi>appointed Heir of all things, Heb. 1. 3. By Inheritance he obtains this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent name,</hi> to be Lord of this Houſe. God ſends <hi>him</hi> to the <hi>Vineyard as the Heir,</hi> after his ſervants were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed: And he hath an Engagement from his Father, that he ſhal injoy his whole <hi>Inheritance</hi> upon demand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. For the Father appointed, <hi>in the fulneſſe of time, to gather together all theſe things in Chriſt, both which are in Heaven, and which are in Earth in him, Eph.</hi> 1. 10. So that as Chriſt <hi>is the firſt begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Heb.</hi> 1. 6. and <hi>the firſt born of every creature, Col.</hi> 1. 15. the Right of Heirſhip is his. But this will not do: for</p>
            <p n="2">2. When He ſhould come to take poſſeſſion of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> He findes that it is morgaged, and that a great <hi>Debt</hi> lyes upon it, which he muſt <hi>pay</hi> to the uttermoſt farthing, if ever He intend to have it. To the former Title, there muſt alſo be added a <hi>Right of Furchaſe.</hi> He muſt <hi>Purchaſe</hi> this <hi>Houſe,</hi> and pay a great <hi>Price</hi> for it. And what is this Price? what is required of him? No leſſe then his <hi>deareſt blood, Acts</hi> 20. 28. Yea he muſt <hi>make his Soul an Offering for ſin;</hi> and charge himſelf with the whole <hi>Debt,</hi> all the Curſe and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which this <hi>Houſe</hi> had in part actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted upon it ſelf, and wholly deſerved. He muſt put his ſhoulders under the burden due to it, and his <hi>back to the ſtripes</hi> prepared for it. A hard Task. But Jeſus Chriſt being the <hi>Heir,</hi> the <hi>Right of Redemption</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto him. It was not for his Honour that it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115349:15"/>
ſhould lye unredeemed. Full well he knew that if he did it not, the whole Creation was too <hi>beggarly</hi> to make this Purchaſe. 'Tis true, that Nature of ours, which He aſſumed to pay that by, which He never took, was ſtartled for a while, and would have depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated this grievous price, crying out, <hi>If it be poſsible let this cup paſſe from me:</hi> but he recollects himſelf and ſayes, <hi>I am content to do thy will O God:</hi> and ſo, through the eternall ſpirit offered himſelf up into God for a Ranſome. He likes the Houſe, and will have it to dwel in what ever it coſt him. <hi>Here</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall be my Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation and my dwelling for ever, Pſal. 133. Know you not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that you are the Temple of the Spirit of Chriſt?</hi> Well, and how come we ſo to be? <hi>you are bought with a price, 2. Cor</hi> 6. 19. They who affirm that he alſo thus purchaſed the <hi>unclean ſtyes</hi> of the Divel, wot not what they ſay.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Unto <hi>Purchaſe,</hi> He muſt alſo adde <hi>Conqueſt.</hi> An unjuſt Uſurper had taken poſſeſſion of this Houſe, and kept it in bondage: <hi>Sathan</hi> had ſeized on it, and brought it, through the wrath of God, under his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

He overpowers him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroves him, in that, <hi>Through death he deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the divel, Heb.</hi> 2. 14. 2. He ſpoyled him having overcome him, <hi>He bund the ſtrong man, and then ſpoyled his goods, Math</hi> 12. 27. All that darkneſſe, unbelief, ſin, and hardneſſe, that he had ſtuffed this Houſe withall, Chriſt ſpoyles them, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115349:15"/>
ſcatters them all away. 3. To make his Conqueſt compleat, He triumphs over his Enemy, and like a mighty Conquerour makes an open ſhew of him to his everlaſting ſhame, <hi>Col. 2. 15. Having ſpoyled Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing over them in his Croſse:</hi> And by this means ſtrengthens his Title to his Inheritance.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Is this the <hi>Houſe</hi> of Chriſt? is he the <hi>Owner</hi> of it? let men take heed how they ſpoyl it for themſelves. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> makes this a great Argument in his plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt oppoſers, that they came <hi>into the Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, Pſal.</hi> 79. 1. The Title of Chriſts <hi>purchaſe</hi> was not then ſo clearely known, as that of his <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and therefore they of old pleaded chiefly by that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Now he hath proclaimed to all, his other <hi>Titles</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: the whole Right he has to this Houſe, to his <hi>Saints.</hi> Who then ſhall meddle with it and go free? Amongſt men, every one with all his might will defend his own poſſeſſion.

            <p n="2">2. Is Chriſt the <hi>Owner</hi> of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> let the <hi>Order</hi> and diſpoſall of it, be left to himſelf.

Chriſt is exceeding jealous of his Honour in this particular: He cannot bear it, that men pretending to his Glory, ſhould think him ſo wanting in <hi>Love,</hi> or <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> towards his own, as not exactly to diſpoſe of all things that concern the Reiglement thereof. Men would not be ſo dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in their own Houſes, as they deal with Chriſt in his.

            <p n="2">2.

            <p>Now this <hi>Houſe</hi> receives a two fold <hi>building. 1.

            <p n="1">1. For the firſt. If all the moſt skilfull <hi>Workmen</hi> in the world ſhould go to the <hi>pit of Nature,</hi> by their own ſtrength to hew out <hi>ſtones</hi> for this <hi>building,</hi> they will never with all their skill and diligence, lay one ſtone upon it.

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:115349:17"/>
Chriſt's <hi>building</hi> of his myſticall <hi>Houſe,</hi> is his giving life unto dead ſtones, or rather, being <hi>life</hi> unto them. Of thoſe who will attempt to build themſelves, and draw a Principle of ſpirituall life, from the broken <hi>Ciſterns</hi> of Nature, I ſhall ſpeak afterwards.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, or the communion of <hi>living ſtones</hi> one with another, and all with Chriſt, in the Order and Worſhip appointed by the Goſpel, ſo becoming <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> and <hi>dwelling places of Mount Sion,</hi> this alſo is of him. This is for his outward ſolemn Worſhip: and he would never allow, that the will of any creature, ſhould be the meaſure of his Honour. He ſets up the <hi>Candleſticks,</hi> and holds the <hi>Starres</hi> in his hand. Look to the Inſtitution of this building, it is from Chriſt: Look for Directions about this building, it is wholly from him. From him, his Word, his Spirit, is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, Direction, and Perfection of it: from hence now take ſome Obſervations.</p>

will of man, or the will of God that drawes men unto Chriſt? And is it Spirit or fleſh that unites us to him? Where then is this <hi>workman</hi> employed that makes all this noyſe in the world? Even there where men cry, <hi>Go to, let us build a City and a Tower whoſe top may reach to Heaven? Gen</hi> 11 4 amongſt thoſe who would build a <hi>Babel,</hi> a Tower of their own to get to Heaven by. The Lord comes down and ſcatters all their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-takings.

            <p n="3">3. See hence a great miſtake of many poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who would fain be <hi>ſtones</hi> in this <hi>Houſe:</hi> what courſe take they?

All this while, the <hi>great Maſter Builder</hi> ſtands by, ſcarſely dealt withal. What now is the iſſue of ſuch Attempts? what they <hi>build</hi> one day, fals down in another. When they have oftentimes in their own thoughts, brought the <hi>Building</hi> to ſuch a paſſe, as that they are ready to think, it will be well with them, now ſurely they ſhal have a ſhare &amp; Intereſt in this <hi>living</hi> &amp; <hi>glorious Houſe,</hi> when all on the ſuddain they fal again to the ground: their Hopes wither, and they ſuppoſe themſelves in the worlds <hi>rubbiſh</hi> again. There is no end of this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternation. Would now this poor ſoul ſee where its

It hath not applyed it ſelf aright to the only <hi>Builder.</hi> Wouldeſt thou be a <hi>ſtone</hi> in this <hi>Fabrick,</hi> lay thy ſelf before the Lord Jeſus: ſay to him, that thou art in thy ſelf altogether unfit for the great <hi>Building</hi> he hath in hand, tha thou haſt often attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to put thy ſelf upon it, but all in vain: Now Lord Jeſus, do thou take me into thine own Hand: if thou caſteſt me away, I cannot complain: I muſt juſtifie thee in all thy ways: but thou calleſt things that are not, as though they were.

            <p>The vanity of men attempting to mixe their Power and Wiſedome in the heaping up Tabernacles for Chriſt, might be hence diſcovered, but I forbear. </p>
            <p n="3">3. Jeſus Chriſt is the great <hi>Watchman</hi> or Keeper of this Houſe. There are indeed other <hi>Watchmen,</hi> and that of God's own appointment for the uſe of this Houſe. <hi>Son of man, I have ſet thee a Watchman, Ezek. 2. 11. I have ſet Watchmen upon thy walls, Iſa</hi> 61. 6, 7. which in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner are the Paſtors of the Churches, <hi>they watch, Heb.</hi> 13. 17. As the Prieſts and Levits heretofore kept the watch of the Lord: It cannot be denyed, but that many who have taken upon them to be theſe <hi>Watchmen,</hi> have watched onely for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, have been very <hi>dogs,</hi> yea <hi>dumb dogs,</hi> the very worſt of <hi>dogs, Iſa.</hi> 66. 10. yea they have been, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes are under various pretences, great <hi>ſmiters and wounders of the Spouſe of Chriſt, Cant</hi> 5. but yet were they never ſo good and true to their Truſts, they were never able all to <hi>watch</hi> and keep this <hi>Houſe,</hi> had it not another <hi>Watchman. Except the Lord keep the City, theſe Watchmen watch in vain, Pſal. 127. 1. He that keepeth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115349:18"/>
Iſrael,</hi> who doth neither <hi>ſlumber nor ſleep,</hi> muſt keep this <hi>Houſe,</hi> or it will be deſtroyed. Chriſt then is that <hi>Holy One, and that WATCHER that came down from Heaven, and commanded to cut down the tree and the branches, Dan. 4. 13, 14. Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and his great power, for medling with this <hi>Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Chriſt <hi>watcheth</hi> this <hi>Houſe</hi> for two ends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſee what it wants, 2. <hi>Cor. 16. 9. The eyes of the Lord run to and fro, throughout the whole earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in its behalf. He looks down from heaven to behold them that fear him, Pſal.</hi> 14. He is that <hi>Stone upon which are ſeven Eyes Zech.</hi> 3. 9. A ſufficiency, in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of wiſedome, inſpection, and government for the good of his <hi>Houſe.</hi> And thoſe <hi>ſeven eyes of his run to and fro through the whole earth,</hi> for this very purpoſe, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 10. He takes notice of the ſtate and condition of his People, to eye them in all their diſtreſſes, and to give them timely and ſuitable deliverance. They may call every ſpring of their Refreſhment, <hi>Beer la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ai-roi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſee that the <hi>Son of Violence</hi> draw not nigh unto it, and if he do, to require it at his hands, to make him eat his own fleſh, and drink his own blood, that he may learn to <hi>devour</hi> no more. Obſerve then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whence it is that this <hi>Houſe</hi> which ſeems ſo often to be nigh to deſtruction, is yet preſerved from ruine. Ofttimes it is brought into a condition, that all that <hi>look on</hi> ſay, Now it is gone for ever: but ſtill it reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and gets up again. The Lord Chriſt he looks on all the while: He knowes how far things may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed for tryall. When it comes to that paſſe, that if preſſures and troubles ſhould continue, the <hi>Houſe</hi> would be over born indeed, then he puts in, <hi>rebukes the windes and waves,</hi> and makes all things ſtill again.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115349:19"/>
Like a Father who looks upon his Childe in a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and dangerous buſineſſe, knowes that he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him when he pleaſes, but would willingly ſee him try his ſtrength and cunning, lets him alone, untill perhaps the Childe thinks himſelf quite loſt, and wonders his Father doth not help him: but when the Condition comes to be ſuch, that without help he will be loſt indeed, inſtantly the Father puts in his hand and ſaves him. So deales the Lord Ieſus with his <hi>Houſe,</hi> lets it oftentimes ſtrive and wreſtle with great Oppoſitions, to draw out and exerciſe all the Graces thereof: but yet all this while He <hi>looketh on,</hi> and when danger is <hi>nigh</hi> indeed, He is not <hi>far off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let all the Enemies of the Church know, that there is one, who hath an <hi>Eye</hi> overthem in all their Counſels and under-takings. Whilſt they are <hi>digging</hi> deep, He <hi>looks on,</hi> and <hi>laughs them to ſcorn.</hi> How per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed was the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> when he found that the Prophet was acquainted with all his deſignes, and made them known to the King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> It cannot but be a matter of perplexity to the Enemies of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> when they ſhall finde that the great Friend and Protector thereof, is continually preſent in all their <hi>Adviſoes.</hi> Let them not wonder at their birthleſſe under-takings, the <hi>Eye</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſtill u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let the <hi>Saints</hi> ſee their <hi>priviledge,</hi> who ever they are, in what condition ſoever, the <hi>Eye</hi> of Chriſt is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. He <hi>watches</hi> over them for good, and knowes their ſoules in Adverſity. When no Eye ſees them, he <hi>looks</hi> on them, they cannot be caſt out of his care, nor hid from his ſight. There are many poor ſouls, who goe heavily all the day long; that mourn in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115349:19"/>
unknown, unregarded, unpitted: The <hi>Eye</hi> of Chriſt is on them for good continually: they cannot be thrown out of his <hi>watchfull care.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Chriſt is the <hi>In dweller</hi> of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> He hath not <hi>built</hi> it, and <hi>framed</hi> it, for no uſe.

It is true for his human Nature, <hi>the Hevens muſt receive him untill the time of the Reſtitution of all things, Acts.</hi> 4. 27. but yet, he dwelleth in this <hi>Houſe</hi> three ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By his Spirit,</hi> Chriſt dwels in this <hi>Houſe,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>stone</hi> of it, by his <hi>Spirit Know you not that Chriſt is in you except you be reprobates. 2 Cor 13. 5 Chriſt in you</hi> that is, the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt; Chriſt by his Spirit.</hi> So the Holy Ghoſt expounds it, <hi>Rom. 8. 9. If the Spirit of God dwell in you,</hi> which: v 10. is <hi>if Chriſt be in you:</hi> Chriſt and his Spirit, as to <hi>Indwelling</hi> are all one: for he <hi>dwels</hi> in us by his Spirit. <hi>The love of God is ſhed in abroad in our Hearts by the Holy Ghoſt that is given unto us, Rom.</hi> 5. 5. There is not only the <hi>love of God,</hi> a grace of the Spirit <hi>ſhed abroad in us,</hi> but there is alſo the <hi>Holy Spirit giuen unto us.</hi> This is fully aſſerted, <hi>Rom. 8. 11. The Spirit of him that rayſed up Jeſus, dwels in you:</hi> as alſo, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 14. keep the good thing committed to thee, by the Holy Ghoſt that dwelleth in us,</hi> Hence the Saints are ſaid to be <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of</hi> the Holy Ghoſt. Jeſus Chriſt doth not <hi>build Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> merely for Graces, created Graces, He <hi>dwels</hi> in them himſelf, He <hi>dwels</hi> in them by his Spirit. And this is a glorious <hi>Priviledge</hi> of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt

in a Miſticall and wounderfull manner ſhould <hi>dwell</hi> in it, and every <hi>ſtone</hi> of it. Hereby all beleivers become to be not one perſonall but) one <hi>Miſticall</hi> Chriſt. 1 <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

However we are diſtanced, in reſpect of his human Nature, yet Miſtically we are one, one body, one Miſtical Chriſt, becauſe we have one Spirit, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us and him. If a man were never ſo tall, ſo that his <hi>Head</hi> ſhould reach the ſterres, and his freet ſtand upon the Ground, yet having but <hi>one ſoul,</hi> he is but one man ſtill. Though Chriſt in his human Nature be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly diſtanced from us, yet there being one and the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> in him and us, wee are one Myſticall Chriſt. Yet abſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though Chriſt be united unto the perſons of the <hi>Saints,</hi> by the <hi>Indwelling</hi> of the Spirit, yet the <hi>Saints</hi> have not that which is called <hi>Perſonal Vnion,</hi> with him nor with the Spirit <hi>Perſonal Vnion</hi> is, by a perſon of the Deity, aſſuming the nature of man, into one perſonall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with it ſelf, that having of it sown no perſonall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Things are here clean otherwiſe: Chriſt doth not aſſume the <hi>Saints</hi> into a perſonall ſubſiſtance with himſelf, but dwels in their perſons by his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Operations of the <hi>Indwelling</hi> Spirit of Chriſt, and all his manifeſtations are <hi>Voluntary.</hi> He <hi>worketh</hi> as he will, &amp; <hi>revealeth</hi> what he wil: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By his graces.</hi> Chriſt <hi>dwelleth</hi> in this <hi>Houſe</hi> and in all the <hi>ſtones</hi> thereof by his <hi>Graces. He dwells in our

They are indeed the ornaments of the <hi>living ſtones</hi> of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> to make them meet and fit for ſuch an Indweller as the Lord Chriſt. Chriſt will not dwell in a ſoule, whoſe mind is darkneſſe, His <hi>will</hi> ſtubborneſſe, and His Affections carnall and ſenſuall. He puts Light, and life, and love, upon the ſoule, that it may be meet for him to dwell in: Chriſt dwels in all the <hi>world</hi> by his <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>Preſence,</hi> but he dwels only in his <hi>Saints,</hi> by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi>

The Ordinances of Chriſt, are the great Ornaments of his Kingly Court: by them he is glorious in all the <hi>Aſſemblies of mount Sion.</hi> Some would faine caſt out this <hi>Indwelling</hi> of Chriſt from among his Saints: In due time he will throughly rebuke them: Some againe would thruſt him out into the <hi>world:</hi> but he will make men know, that his <hi>Ordinances</hi> are given unto his: it is true the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of ſome of them, extends to the world, but the <hi>Right</hi> and enjoyment of them, that, is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of his Saints: Thus Chriſt dwels in his Houſe: Hence Obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Intimacy</hi> of the Lord Jeſus with <hi>his Saint,</hi> and the delight he takes in them: Hedwelleth <hi>with</hi> them, he dwelleth <hi>in</hi> them.

            <p n="1">1, <hi>I will ſup with him.</hi> I will delight and ſatisfie my ſelf with him. Jeſus Chriſt takes abundance of delight and contentment in the Hearts of his Saints. When they are <hi>faithfull,</hi> when they are <hi>fruitfull,</hi> He is marvellouſly refreſhed with it. Hence is that Prayer of the Spouſe, <hi>Awake O North winde and come</hi> thou <hi>South, blow upon my Garden, that the ſavour of my ſpices may flow out, let my boloved come and eat of his ſpices, Can.</hi> 4. 16. ſhe would have the <hi>Spices,</hi> the <hi>Graces</hi> ſhe hath received, breathed on by a freſh gale of the Spirit, that they might yeeld a <hi>ſweet ſavour.</hi> And why ſo? that her Beloved may have ſomething for his <hi>Entertainment,</hi> that hee may come and <hi>ſup,</hi> and eat of his pleaſant fruits. A poor Soul, that hath received Chriſt, hath not any deſire ſo fervent, as that it may have ſomething for the Entertainment of him: that He who <hi>filled</hi> it when it was hungry, may not (as it were) be ſent away <hi>empty.</hi> And the Lord Jeſus is exceedingly taken with thoſe Refreſhments. <hi>The King is held in his Galleries, Cant.</hi> 4. 5. Hee is detained, yea bound with delight, He knowes not how to paſſe away. Therefore <hi>He reſts in his love, Zeph.</hi> 3. 17.

He provides <hi>love</hi> for us. When the Spirit of Chriſt, is beſtowed on us, <hi>he ſheads abroad the love of God in our Hearts, Rom. 5. 5. He ſheeds it abroad,</hi> powers it out abundantly. Friends, love is a Choyce danty. He that knows it not is a ſtranger to all ſpirituall banquets: It is a choyce diſh <hi>in the feaſt of fatt things,</hi> that Chriſt prepareth: He povides <hi>Righteouſneſſe and Peace and joy in the holy Ghost</hi> for us.

            <p n="2">2 Doth Chriſt Dwell in us by his Spirit, ſhould we not be carefull, leaſt <hi>we grieve that Spirit of his?</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt is very tender. Did the Saints conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually conſider this, that Chriſt dwells in them, that he is grieved, and troubled, at all their unbeliefe, unruly paſſions, worldy deſires, fooliſh Imaginations, ſurely they could not but be much more watchfulover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then generally they are. He is refreſhed when we walk with him, and hold <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with him To turn aſide from him, to hold <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with world

or fleſh, this grives him, and burdens him. <hi>Oh grive not the Spirit of God whereby you are ſealed to the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi> And let me tell you, if you doe, though he will not <hi>utterly</hi> depart from you, nor take his kindnes away for <hi>ever more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> yet he will do that that ſhall make your heartake, your joynts tremble, and break all your bones in peices: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1 He will depart from you, as to all ſenſe of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: that you ſhal have neither joy, nor comfort, nor peace. He will <hi>hide his face,</hi> and make you believe (as we ſay) that he is gone utterly from you. And this he will doe, not for a day or a night or ſo, but for a great while together. <hi>You ſhall goe to ſeeke him, and you ſhall not find him.</hi> Yea beg, and cry, and have no Anſwer: Now all the world for one ſmile from Chriſt, for one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his preſence upon my Heart, and all in vain. When the Spirit of Chriſt was thus departed from <hi>David</hi> upon his miſcarriage, as to the ſenſe and joy of it: how doth he cry out, <hi>Make me to hear the voyce of joy and gladneſſe, that the bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce, Pſal.</hi> 51. 8. If thou valueſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt at no greater rate, but to jeopard it upon every Occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou mayſt haply go without the comfort of it all thy dayes. Examine your ſelves, is it not ſo with ſome of you? have you not loſt the ſenſe of the preſence of Chriſt by your folly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even walking? Perhaps you value it not much, but go on as <hi>Sampſon</hi> with his hair cut, and think to do as at other times: but if the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> ſet upon thee, it will be ſorrow and trouble. In every <hi>Aſſault</hi> thou wilt finde thy ſelf a loſt man. Sooner or later it

will bee bitterneſſe to thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He will depart, as to the Efficacie of his working in thee,</hi> and leave thee ſo weak, that thou ſhalt not be able to walk with God. His Spirit is a Spirit of <hi>Grace and Supplications.</hi> He will ſo with-draw it, that thou ſhalt find thy Heart in a poor condition, as to thoſe things. To be cold in Prayer, dead in Hearing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged from Meditation, ſleight in all dutyes, this ſhall be thy portion. A frame that a tender Soul would tremble to think of. Ah! how many poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are come to this ſtate in theſe dayes, by their neglect and contempt of Chriſt dwelling in them, they have <hi>loſt their ſirſt love,</hi> their firſt life, their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are ready to dy, and their whole ſoules aſleep, in a heartleſſe, lifeleſſe, zealeleſſe frame. They ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>but yet as through fire.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>He will depart as to Aſſurance of what is to come,</hi> as well as to a ſenſe of what is preſent.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Doth he dwell in us by his Grace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us firſt know whence all Graces are,</hi> that in a want, or weakneſſe of them, we may know whither to go for a ſupply. <hi>Of his fulneſſe we receive, &amp; Grace for Grace.</hi> All ſupplyes of Graces are from Chriſt. <hi>Lord,

How ſweet would it be with us, if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſerious conſideration from whence all theſe Graces flow, that we would apply our ſelves to draw out fafther degrees and heightenings of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might dwell more plentifully in us, and wee might alwayes converſe with him in his Gracious Train of Attendants. How this may be done in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, is not my buſineſſe now to ſhew.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Learn to tender the Graces of Chriſt,</hi> as thoſe which hold out his preſence to us. Let us tender them in our own Hearts, and prize them in whomſoever they are. They are pledges o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1.
