            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis following Discourse was Written for the satisfaction of a particular Person, who owned the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but expressed a mean Esteem of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> Which is become so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a <hi>Theme</hi> among the <hi>Scepticks</hi> of this <hi>Age,</hi> that the Author of this Discourse thought it worth his time and care, to consider the force of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that were made against them. Especially, being written in a grave and serious manner, and not with that <hi>Raillery</hi> and <hi>Buffonry,</hi> which the rude Persons of this Age commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon Religion. It might be
<pb facs="tcp:57894:3"/>
justly expected from such who pretend to <hi>Breeding</hi> and <hi>Civility,</hi> that they would at least shew more respect to a thing, which hath prevailed so much among Men of the best Understanding and Education, and who have had no Interest to carry on by it. For it is against the ordinary Rules of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, to affront that which others think they have great Reason to esteem and love; and they would not endure that scorn and contempt of their meanest Servant, which they too often shew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Religion, and the things belonging to it. If they are not <hi>in earnest</hi> when they scoff and mock at sacred things, their own consciences will tell them it is a horrible impiety; if they are <hi>in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,</hi> let them debate these things calmly and seriously, and let the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>Reason</hi> prevail. Men may speak sharply and wittily against the clearest things in the World, as the <hi>Scepticks</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57894:3"/>
of old did against all Certainty of Sense and Reason; but we should think that Man out of his senses, that would now dispute the Being of the Sun, or the Colour of the Snow. We do not say, the Matters of Religion are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the same evidence with that of Sense; but it is a great part of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and understanding, to know the proportion and fitness of evidence to the Nature of the thing to be proved. They would not have the Eye to judge of tasts, nor the Nose of <hi>Metaphysicks;</hi> and yet these would be as proper as to have the senses judge of Immaterial Beings. If we do not give as good Reason for the Principles of our Religion, as the nature of Religion considered, can be given for it, let us then be blamed for our weakness in defending it; but let not Religion suffer, till they are sure nothing more can be said for it.</p>

There is a late <hi>Author,</hi> I hear is <note place="margin">Tractat. Theol. politic.</note> mightily in vogue among many, who cry up any thing on the <hi>Atheistical side,</hi> though never so weak and trifling. It were no difficult task to lay open the false Reasonings, and inconsistent <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of his Book; which hath been sufficiently done already in that Language wherein it was written. But if for the <hi>Advancement</hi> of <hi>Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> among us, that <hi>Book</hi> be, as it is talked, Translated into our Tongue, there will not, I hope, want those who will be as ready to defend <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Morality,</hi> as others are to decry and despise them.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any skill in the <hi>depths of Theology,</hi> yet I am heartily concerned for the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Christian Religion;</hi> which it is the design of your papers to undermine. When I first looked them over, I could not think them so considerable as to deserve a particular Answer; especially, from one in my cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, who have so much
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57894:5"/>
other business lying upon me, and so little leisure and health to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it; but I found at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of your Papers, so earnest and vehement a desire expressed by you, that I would return an Answer, in order to the settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your mind, that I could not refuse an Office of so great Charity, as you represent it to be. I confess, when I considered the nature of your Objections, and the manner of managing them, I could hardly believe that they proceeded from a doubtful Mind, that was desirous of any satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but since you tell me so, I will first shew my Charity in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it, and then in endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to give you my poor assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and impartial advice, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to your satisfaction. And in truth, I think impartial advice will
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57894:5"/>
contribute more to that end, than spending Time and Paper in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through all the difficulties, which it is possible for a cavilling Mind to raise against the plainest <hi>Truths</hi> in the World. For there is nothing so clear and evident, but a <hi>Sophistical Wit</hi> will always find something to say against it, and if you be the <hi>Person</hi> I take you for, you very well know, that there have been some, who wanted neither Wit, nor Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, who have gone about to prove, <hi>That there was Nothing in the World; and that if there were any thing, it could not be understood by Men; that if it were understood by one Man, it could not be expressed to another:</hi> And besides such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant undertakers as these, how many have there been, who with plausible and subtle Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57894:6"/>
have endeavoured to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all manner of <hi>Certainty,</hi> either by <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Reason?</hi> Must we therefore quit all pretences to <hi>Certainty,</hi> because we cannot, it may be, Answer all the Subtilties of the <hi>Scepticks?</hi> And therefore I am by no means satisfied with your manner of proceeding, <hi>desiring all particular difficulties to be Answer'd, before we consider the main evidences of the Christian Faith:</hi> For the only reasonable way of proceeding in this matter, is to consider, first, whether there be sufficient <hi>Motives</hi> to perswade you to imbrace the <hi>Christian Faith;</hi> and then to weigh the difficulties, and to compare them with the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> for belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and if those do not appear great enough to overthrow the force of the other, you may rest
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57894:6"/>
satisfied in the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you cannot Answer every difficulty that may be raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Books</hi> wherein our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is contained. I pray Sir, consider with your self; do not you think it possible for any man to have Faith enough to save him, unless he can solve all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in <hi>Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ologie</hi> that are in the <hi>Bible,</hi> unless he can give an account of every particular <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Custom</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he can make out all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Schemes,</hi> and can tell what the <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> means? If a Man may believe and be saved, without these things, to what purpose are they objected for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the <hi>Christian Faith?</hi> Do you think a Man hath not reason enough to believe there is <hi>extended
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57894:7"/>
Matter</hi> in the World, unless he can solve all the difficulties that arise from the <hi>extension</hi> or <hi>divisibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of <hi>Matter;</hi> or that he hath a <hi>Soul,</hi> unless he can make it clear how an immaterial and material Substance can be so united as our <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> are? Or that the <hi>Sun</hi> shines, unless he can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate whether the <hi>Sun</hi> or the <hi>Earth</hi> moves? Or that we have any <hi>certainty</hi> of things, unless he can assign the undoubted <hi>criterion</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood</hi> in all things? These things I mention on purpose, to let you see, that the most certain things, have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties about them, which no one thinks it necessary for him to Answer, in order to his assurance of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>things;</hi> but as long as the evidence for them is much more considerable than the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57894:7"/>
Objections against them, we may safely acquiesce in our assent to them, and leave the unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding these difficulties to <hi>the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters of this World,</hi> or the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of another. Is it not far more reasonable for us to think, that in <hi>Books</hi> of so great <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as those of <hi>Moses</hi> are, written in a Language whose <hi>Idiotisms</hi> are so different from ours, there may be some difficulty in the <hi>Phrases,</hi> or computation of Times or Customs of the People, that we cannot well understand, than that all the Miracles wrought by <hi>Moses</hi> should have been Impostures; and that Law, which was preserved so constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, maintained with that resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the wisest of the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who chose to dye rather than disown it, should be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57894:8"/>
all a cheat? Is it not more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for us to suspect our own Understandings, as to the <hi>Speeches</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> of some of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> than to think that Men who designed so much the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Virtue, and discouraging Vice, should be a pack of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and Deceivers? Can any Man of common sense suspect the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> to be a <hi>Fourb,</hi> or an Imposture, because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand the Number of the <hi>Beast,</hi> or Interpret the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptick Visions?</hi> I could hardly have believed any Man preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Reason,</hi> could object these things, unless I saw them, and were called upon to Answer them.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Sir, my serious and impartial advice to you is, in the first place to consider and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57894:8"/>
the main point, <hi>i. e.</hi> the proofs of the <hi>Christian Doctrin,</hi> and not to hunt up and down the <hi>Scriptures</hi> for every thing that seems a difficulty to you, and then by heaping all these together to make the <hi>Scriptures</hi> seem a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed heap of indigested stuff, which being taken in pieces and considered, with that modesty, diligence, and care, that doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us, will appear to contain nothing unbecoming that <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Venerable</hi> Name which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> do bear among us.</p>
            <p>If therefore, you design not cavilling but satisfaction, you will joyn issue with me upon the most material point, <hi>viz. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Christian Religion were from God, or from Men?</hi> For if this be proved to have been from <hi>God,</hi> all the other things will easily fall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57894:9"/>
off of themselves, or be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with a little industry.</p>
            <p>In the Debate of this, I shall consider, first, what things are agreed upon between us, and then wherein the difference lies.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You grant an absolutely perfect and independent Being, whom we call God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the World was at first Created, and is still governed by Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That He is so Holy, as to be the Author of no Sin, although he doth not hinder Men from sinning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That this God is to receive from us all Worship proper to Him, of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Praises,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That it is the Will of this God, that we should lead holy, peaceable, and innocent Lives.</hi>
            </p>

1. <hi>Whether the matters of Fact were true or no?</hi> And as to this point, I wish you had set down the Reasons of your doubting, more clearly and distinctly than you have done: What I can pick up, amounts to these things. 1. <hi>That there can be no certainty of a matter done at such a distance of time, there having been many fictitious Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories in the World.</hi> 2. <hi>That it is probable, that these things might be written, when there was no one Living to detect the falshood of them; and thus you say, the</hi> Grecians, Romans, Egyptians, <hi>and other Nations were at first imposed upon by some Men, who pretended to deliver to them the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of their Gods and Heroes, and the Wonders wrought by them.</hi> 3. <hi>That these things might more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be done, before Printing was used; and that there is reason to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57894:10"/>
suspect the more, because of the Pious Frauds of the Primitive Christians, and the Legends of the Papists.</hi> 4. <hi>That there may have been many more Deceptions and Impostures in the way of propagating false Revelations and Miracles than we can now discover.</hi> 5. <hi>That we ought not to take the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Scripture, or the Christian Writers in this case, because they may be suspected of partiality; and that the Testimony of</hi> Josephus <hi>is sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by divers learned Men to be fraudulently put in by Christians.</hi> 6. <hi>That there are susficient grounds from the Story it self, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of Enemies to suspect the truth of it; because of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and inconsistency of the parts of it; the want of accomplishment of the Promises and Prophecies of it; the obscurity and unintelligibleness of other parts; the defects of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57894:11"/>
mentioned therein, St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s oftentation, the jarrs between</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul, <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas. 7. <hi>That from these things you have just cause to doubt the Apostles since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and you think they might have indirect ends in divulging the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles recorded in Scripture; and that Men might be contented to suffer, to make themselves heads of a new Sect of Religion, and to rule over the Consciences of Men; and that they had time enough to make a considerable interest before the Persecutions began.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the force of all I can find out, in the several parts of your Papers towards the invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating the Testimony concerning the <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>fact</hi> reported in the Writings of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>In Answer to all these things, I shall shew; 1. That matters
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57894:11"/>
of fact done at such a distance of time may have sufficient evidence to oblige Men to believe them. 2. That there is no reason to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Truth of those Matters of fact which are contained in the History of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 3. That the <hi>Apostles</hi> gave the greatest testimonies of their Sincerity, that could be expected from them; and that no matters of fact were ever better attested than those which are reported by them; from whence it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, That it is not reason but unreasonable <hi>Suspicion</hi> and <hi>Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism,</hi> if not willfulness and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy which makes Men to continue to doubt after so great evidence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we may have such evidence of <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> done at such a <hi>distance</hi> of time as may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57894:12"/>
oblige us to believe the Truth of them. This we are first to make out, because several of your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections seem to imply, <hi>That we can have no certainty of such things; because we cannot know what tricks may have been plaid in former times, when it was far more easie to deceive; and that it is confessed, there have been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Frauds of this kind, which have a long time prevailed in the World.</hi> But have not the very same Arguments been used against all <hi>Religion,</hi> by <hi>Atheists?</hi> And if the <hi>Cheats</hi> that have been in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> have no force against the <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> why should they have any against the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi> And if the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Mankind signifie any thing as to the acknowledgement of a <hi>Deity,</hi> why should not the

               <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> so circumstantiated as it is, be of sufficient strength to receive the Matters of Fact delivered by it? which is all I at present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.

any competent Testimony at all; for if such things be written by Enemies and Strangers, we have reason to suspect both their knowledge and integ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ity; if written by <hi>Friends,</hi> then though they might know the <hi>Truth,</hi> yet they would write partially of their own side: So that upon this principle, no History at all, ancient or modern is to be believed; for they are all reported either by Friends or Enemies: and so not only Divine, but all Humane Faith will be destroyed. I am by no means a Friend to unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable credulity; but I am as little to unreasonable distrust and suspicion; if the one be Folly, the other is Madness. No pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Man believes any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is possible to be true; nor rejects any thing meerly because
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57894:14"/>
it is possible to be false: But it is the prudence of every Man to weigh and consider all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and according to them, to assent, or dissent. We all know it is possible for Men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or to be deceived, but we know there is no necessity of either; and that there is such a thing as Truth in the World; and though Men may deceive, yet they do not always so; and that Men may know they are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. For else there could be no such thing as <hi>Society</hi> among Mankind; no <hi>Friendship,</hi> or <hi>Trust,</hi> or <hi>Confidence</hi> in the Word of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person; because it is possible that the best Friend I have may deceive me, and the World is full of dissimulation, must I therefore believe no Body? This is the just consequence of this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57894:14"/>
way of Arguing, <hi>That we have reason to suspect the Truth of these Matters of Fact, because there have been many Frauds in the World, and might have been many more than we can now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover;</hi> for if this Principle be pursued, it will destroy all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety among Men; which is built on the supposition of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual trust and confidence that Men have in each other: And although it be possible for all Men to deceive, because we cannot know one anothers hearts, yet there are such Characters of Honesty and Fidelity in some Persons, that others dare venture their Lives and Fortunes upon their Words. And is any Man thought a Fool for doing so? Nay, have not the most prudent and sagacious Men reposed a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57894:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mighty confidence in the Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of others? And without this, no great affairs can be carried on in the World; for since the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Persons need the help of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to manage their business, they must trust other Men conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually; and every Man puts his Life into the hands of others, to whom he gives any freedome of access, and especially his Servants: Must a Man therefore live in continual suspicion and jealousie, because it is possible he may be deceived? But if this be thought unreasonable, then we gain thus much, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the possibility of deception, Men may be trusted in some cases, and their Fidelity safely relied upon: This being granted, we are to enquire what that assurance is which makes us
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57894:15"/>
trust any one; and whereever we find a concurrence of the same circumstances, or equal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of fidelity, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the same trust or confidence in them. And we may soon find that it is not any ones bare Word that makes us trust him; but either the reputation of his Integrity among discerning Men; or our long experience and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of him: This latter is only confined to our own tryal; but the former is more general, and reaches beyond our own Age, since we may have the <hi>Testimony</hi> of discerning Persons convey'd down to us in as certain a manner, as we can know the mind of a <hi>Friend</hi> at a 100 Miles distance, <hi>viz.</hi> by Writing. And in this case, we desire no more than to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that those things were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57894:16"/>
by them; and that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be believed in what they writ; thus, if any one would be satisfied about the passages of the <hi>Peloponnesian War,</hi> and hath heard that <hi>Thucydides</hi> hath accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately written it, he hath no more to do, than to enquire whether this <hi>Thucydides</hi> were capable of giving a good account of it, and for that, he hears that he was a great and inquisitive Person, that lived in that Age, and knew all the occurrences of it; and when he is satisfied of that, his next enquiry is, whether he may be trusted or no; and for this, he can expect no better satisfaction, than that his History hath been in great reputation for its integrity among the most knowing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; but how shall he be sure this was the History, written by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57894:16"/>
               <hi>Thucydides,</hi> since there have been many counterfeit Writings ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon the World? Besides the consent of learned Men in all Ages since, we may compare the <hi>Testimonies</hi> cited out of it with the History we have, and the Style, with the Character given of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides,</hi> and the Narrations, with other credible Histories of those <hi>Times;</hi> and if all these agree, what reason can there be not to rely upon the History of <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides?</hi> All learned Men do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that there have been multitudes of fictitious writings, but do they therefore question, whether there are any genuine? Or whether we have not the true <hi>Herodotus, Strabo,</hi> or <hi>Pausanias,</hi> because there is a counterfeit <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosus, Manetho,</hi> and <hi>Philo,</hi> set forth by <hi>Annius</hi> of <hi>Viterbo?</hi> Do

            </p>
            <p>To this I answer. 1. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

or he must make a New one eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Age: If they are, then the obligation lies as much on us now to believe, as if we had lived and conversed with those inspired Persons.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57894:22"/>
               <hi>Apostles</hi> knew all they said to be false, and made it so necessary for all Men to believe what they said to be true; they were some of the greatest deceivers which the World had ever known: But Men that take pleasure in decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, make use of many artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on purpose to catch the silly multitude; they have all the arts of Insinuation and Fawning Speeches, fit to draw in the weakest, and such as love to be flatter'd; but what is there ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this way in all the Apostles Writings? How sharply do they speak to the <hi>Jewish Sanhedrin,</hi> upon the Murther of Christ? With what plainness and simplicity do they go about to perswade Men to be <hi>Christians?</hi> They barely tell the Matters of Fact concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:57894:23"/>
and say <hi>they were eye-witnesses of it,</hi> and upon the credit of this <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of theirs, they Preach <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> to <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi> Was ever any thing farther from the appearance of Artifice than this was? So that if they were deceivers, they were some of the Subtilest that ever were in the World, because there seems to be so little ground for any sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of Fraud; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not easily imagin Persons of their Education, capable of so profound dissimulation and so artificial a Cheat. Besides all this, we are to consider how far such Persons do allow the liberty of <hi>dissimulation</hi> and <hi>artificial Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> especially in <hi>Religion;</hi> we see the <hi>Papists</hi> could not practice these things, without being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to defend them, by shewing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57894:23"/>
how convenient it is for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be told strange Stories of <hi>Saints,</hi> on purpose to <hi>nourish De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi> in them: To which end, they say, <hi>it signifies not much, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were true or no:</hi> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they assert the <hi>Lawfulness of Equivocations, and Mental Reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and doing things, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise justifiable, for the Honour of their Church and Religion;</hi> And I shall freely confess to you, if I found any countenance to such things as these, from the Doctrin or Practice of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> it would give me too just a ground for suspicion as to what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd. For if they allowed <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,</hi> or <hi>Mental Reservations,</hi> how could I possibly know what they meant by any thing they said? For that which was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to make the Proposition true,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57894:24"/>
lay without my reach in the Mind of another; and while they so firmly attested that <hi>Christ was risen from the Dead,</hi> they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Resurrection;</hi> but if they should be found to allow <hi>Lying</hi> or <hi>Cheating for the cause of Religion,</hi> their credit would be gone with me; for how could I be any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sure of the <hi>Truth</hi> of one Word they said? I should be so far from thinking them <hi>Infallible,</hi> that I could not but suspect them to have a design to deceive me. The first thing therefore we are to look at in Persons who require our belief, is the strictest veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if they falter in this, they expose themselves to the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of all but credulous Fools. But we no where find greater plainness and sincerity required,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57894:24"/>
no where more strict and severe prohibitions of dissimulation in <hi>Religion,</hi> nor more general Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts about <hi>speaking Truth,</hi> than in the Writings of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But might not all this be done with the greater artifice to prevent suspicion?</hi> Suspicion is a thing, which <hi>he that set bounds to the Sea,</hi> can set no bounds to; if Men will give way to it, without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, there can be no end of it. For the most effectual ways to prevent it, will still afford new matter and occasion for it. If Men do use the utmost means that are possible, to assure others of their sincerity, and they will not believe them, but still sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the design to be so much deeper laid; there is no way left possible to satisfy such Men; their suspicion is a disease incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57894:25"/>
by rational means, and such persons deserve to be given over as past all remedy. If Men act like prudent Men, they will judge according to the <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Things;</hi> but if they entertain a jealousie of all Mankind, and the most of those who give them the greatest assurance they have no Intention to deceive them, it is to no purpose to go about to satisfie such Persons, for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry undertaking makes them more suspicious. If the <hi>Apostles</hi> therefore gave as much ground as ever any <hi>Persons</hi> did, or could do, that they had no design to impose upon the World, but proceeding with all the fairness and openness, with the greatest evidence of their sincerity, there can be no reason to fasten upon them the imputation of cunning

Men who made it their business to deceive others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This will more appear if we consider the <hi>Matters</hi> deliver'd by them, and the nature of their Doctrin. For if the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> were only a contrivance of the first Preachers of it, it must by the event be supposed that they were very subtle Men, who in so little time, and against so great opposition could prevail over both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but if we reflect on the <hi>nature</hi> of their <hi>Doctrin,</hi> we can never imagin that these Men did proceed by the same Methods that Men of subtilty do make use of. If it were there own contrivance, it was in their power to have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it as they thought fit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and in all probability, they would have done it in a way
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57894:26"/>
most likely to be successful; but the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> was so far from it, as though they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously designed to advance a <hi>Religion</hi> against the <hi>genius</hi> and <hi>inclination</hi> of all Mankind. For it neither gratifies the voluptuous in their Pleasures, nor the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious in their desires of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pomp and Greatness, nor the Covetous in their thirst after Riches; but lays a severe restraint on all those common and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Passions of Mankind; which <hi>Mahomet</hi> well understood, when he suited his <hi>Religion</hi> to them. <hi>Christianity</hi> was neither accommodated to the Temper and Genius either of <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> were in great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a Temporal <hi>Prince</hi> at that time to deliver them from the <hi>Roman</hi> Slavery; and every
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57894:26"/>
one that would have set up for such a <hi>Messias,</hi> might have had followers enough among them, as we find afterwards by the attempts of <hi>Barchocebas</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But the <hi>Messias</hi> of the <hi>Christians</hi> was so directly contrary to their hopes and expectations, being a <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>suffering Prince,</hi> that this set them the more against his Followers, because they were hereby frustrated of their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test hopes, and defeated in their most pleasing expectations: But besides, if they would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the <hi>Mosaick Law,</hi> it might in probability have succeeded bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but this St. <hi>Paul</hi> would by no means hear of. <hi>But if they rejected the Jews, methinks they should have been willing to have had some assistance from the Gentiles.</hi> No, they charged them with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57894:27"/>
               <hi>Idolatry</hi> where ever they came, and would not joyn in any parts of their Worship with them; nor so much as Eat of the <hi>remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of their <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing they had a mind to set up wholly a new <hi>Sect</hi> of their own; yet we should think they should have framed it after the most plausible manner, and left out all things thar were most liable to Reproach and Infamy: But this they were so far from, that the most contemptible part of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> viz. <hi>A Crucified Saviour,</hi> they insist the most upon, and Preach it on all occasions, and in comparison of it, strangely despise all the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy</hi> of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> What did these Men mean, if <hi>Christianity</hi> had been only a <hi>contrivance</hi> of theirs? If they had but left out
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57894:27"/>
this one circumstance, in all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man probability, the excellent moral Precepts in <hi>Christianity</hi> would have been highly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified among all those who had been bred up under the Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Philosophers.</hi> Nay, they would not make use of the most commendable Methods of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Wisdom; nor do as the <hi>Jesuits</hi> have done in <hi>China,</hi> make Men have a better opinion of the <hi>Religion</hi> they brought, for their skill in <hi>Mathematicks</hi> and <hi>Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi> but as much as it was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to let the World see it was no contrivance of Humane Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they shunned all the ways of shewing it in the manner of its propagation. Nay, when the People would have given the <hi>Apostles</hi> Divine Worship, never were vain Men more concerned
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57894:28"/>
to have it, than they to oppose it; And do these things look like the Actions of Men that designed only to make themselves great, by being the <hi>Heads</hi> of a new <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Religion?</hi>

                  </gap>
               </hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were professed Enemies of <hi>Christianity.</hi> But they are all wonderfully silent in this matter; and instead o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> saying enough to overthrow the <hi>truth of Christianity,</hi> as you seem to suggest, I do assure you, I am
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57894:30"/>
mightily confirmed in the belief of the Truth of it, by carefully observing the slightness of the Objections that were made against it, by its most professed Enemies.</p>
            <p>But you seem to imply, <hi>That all this Story concerning Christ was invented long after the pretended time of his being in the World,</hi> Why may not you as well suspect, that <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> lived before <hi>Romulus;</hi> or that <hi>Augustus</hi> lived at the Seige of <hi>Troy?</hi> For you might as well reject all History upon such grounds as those you assign; and think <hi>Mahomet</hi> as right in his <hi>Chronology,</hi> as the <hi>Bible.</hi> It is time for us to burn all our <hi>Books,</hi> if we have lived in such a Cheat all this while. Methinks you might as well ask, whether <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia</hi> were not <hi>Pope Joan?</hi> Or
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57894:31"/>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>sixth,</hi> one of the <hi>Roman Emperours?</hi> Or whether <hi>Luther</hi> were not the <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Turky?</hi> For there is no greater evidence of any History in the World, than there is, that all the things reported in the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi> were done at that time, when they are pretended to be.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore we offer this Story of the <hi>New Testament</hi> to be compared with all the <hi>Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that Age,</hi> delivered by any other <hi>Historians,</hi> to try if any <hi>inconsistencies</hi> can be found therein: Which is the most reasonable way can be taken to disprove any History. If it could be proved, that there could be no such <hi>Taxation</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> as is mention'd in the time of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi> that <hi>Herod</hi> did not live in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57894:31"/>
that <hi>Age,</hi> or that the <hi>Jews</hi> were not under the <hi>Roman Government,</hi> or that there were no <hi>High Priests</hi> at that time, nor the <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Saducees,</hi> or that there were any other remarkable <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi> of time set down in the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which could be manifestly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; there were some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to call in Question the Truth of the Story; but there is not the least Foundation for any scruple on this account; All things agreeing so well with the truest accounts we have of that <hi>Age,</hi> both from <hi>Josephus</hi> and the <hi>Roman Historie.</hi> I shall not insist on the particular <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Josephus</hi> concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> because we need it not; and if those who question it, would proceed with the same severity against many
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57894:32"/>
other particular passages in good <hi>Authors,</hi> they might as well call them in question as they do that; since it is confessed, that all the Ancient <hi>Manuscripts</hi> have it in them, and supposing that it doth not come in well, must we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it impossible for <hi>Josephus</hi> to Write incoherently? Yet this is the main Argument that ever I have seen urged against this <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi> of <hi>Josephus.</hi> But I say, we need it not; all other things concurring in so high a degree to prove the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> Yet since you seem to express so much doubtfulness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, <hi>as though it were framed when there was no one living capable of disproving it;</hi> give me leave to shew you the great absurdity of such a Supposition. 1. Because we have the plain Testimonies of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57894:32"/>
the greatest Enemies of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> that there was such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as <hi>Christ</hi> was, who suffered according to the <hi>Scripture Story.</hi> For <hi>Tacitus</hi> not only mentions the <hi>Christians</hi> as suffering at <hi>Rome</hi> for their <hi>Religion</hi> in the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>Nero, (Annal.</hi> 15.) but saith, <hi>That the Author of this Religion was one Christ, who suffered under</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>Procurator of</hi> Judea, <hi>in the time of</hi> Tiberius; which is an irrefragable Testimony of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Story concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> in an <hi>Age,</hi> when if it had been false, nothing could have been more easily detected than such a Fiction, by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Jews</hi> which were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at <hi>Rome:</hi> And neither <hi>Julian,</hi> nor <hi>Celsus,</hi> nor <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> nor <hi>Lucian</hi> did ever question the <hi>truth</hi> of the Story it self; but only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57894:33"/>
the <hi>Christians</hi> for attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too much to <hi>Christ.</hi> 2. If there were really such a Person as Christ was, who suffered as <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith, then the whole Story could not be a Fiction, but only some part of it; and these additional parts must either be contrived by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or after their time: Not after their time, for then they must be added after <hi>Christianity</hi> was received in the World, for that, as appears by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> was spread in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> times as far as <hi>Rome;</hi> and if these parts were not received with it; the Cheat would presently have been discover'd as soon as broached, by those who had embraced <hi>Christianity</hi> before: And besides, <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the <hi>Authentick Writings</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57894:33"/>
were then extant, wherein the same things were contained, that we now believe: If these things then were forged, it must be by the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves; and I dare now appeal to you, whether ever any Story was better capable of being disproved than this was, if it had not been true, since it was published in that very time and place, where the <hi>Persons</hi> were living, who were most concerned to disprove it: As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the hatred of the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Christians,</hi> both then and ever since: which is a very observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumstance for proving the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion;</hi> for the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> agreed in the <hi>Divine Revelations</hi> of old, the <hi>Christians</hi> believed moreover, that <hi>Christ</hi> was the <hi>Messias</hi> promised; this <hi>Christ</hi> lived and dyed among
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57894:34"/>
the <hi>Jews</hi> his Enemies; his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> Preached, and wrought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles among their most inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Enemies, which Men that go about to deceive never care to do: And to this Day the <hi>Jews</hi> do not deny the <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi> but look on them as insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to have been the <hi>Messias:</hi> Nay, <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself, who in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability would have overthrown the whole Story of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,</hi> if he could have done it with any colour, yet speaks very honourably of <hi>Christ</hi> and of the great things which were said and done by him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That there is nothing in the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> unbecoming the <hi>Majesty,</hi> or <hi>Holiness,</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> of a <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> As to the precepts, <hi>you acknowledge their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency;</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:57894:34"/>
and the <hi>Promises</hi> chiefly refer either to <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> or <hi>future Glory;</hi> And what is there herein unbecoming <hi>God?</hi> And as to what concerns the <hi>Truth</hi> of it, we have as great Characters of that throughout, as it is possible for us to expect; there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring so much simplicity, sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, candour, and agreement in all the parts of it. Some Men would have been better pleased, it may be, if it had been all writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by one <hi>Person,</hi> and digested into a more exact method, and set forth with all the Lights and Ornaments of Speech. This would have better become an Invention of Men, but not a <hi>Revelation of God:</hi> Plainness and simplicity have a natural great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness above art and subtilty; and therefore <hi>God</hi> made choice of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57894:35"/>
many to write, and at several times, that by comparing them we may see how far they were from contriving together, and yet how exactly they agree in all things which Men are concerned to believe. But you say, <hi>We have many infirmities of the</hi> Apostles <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered therein, their heats and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities one against another.</hi> But I pray consider; 1. How came you to know these things; Is it not by their own Writings? And if they had been such, who minded only their applause, had it not been as easie to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed these things, and would they not certainly have done it, if that had been their aim? If <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>seems to boast,</hi> doth he not do it, with that constraint to himself, as a Man that is forced to do it for his own vindication
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57894:35"/>
against malicious Enemies? And who ever denyed a Man of a generous mind the liberty of speaking for himself? 2. But suppose <hi>they had infirmities and heats among them;</hi> doth this prove that <hi>God</hi> could not make use of them as his Instruments to declare his <hi>Truth</hi> to the World? Then it will follow, that <hi>God</hi> must never reveal his will by <hi>Men,</hi> but by <hi>Voices</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> or the <hi>assumption</hi> of the <hi>humane Nature by the Divine.</hi> But, if <hi>God</hi> be not denyed the liberty of imploying meer Men, we cannot find so great evidences of Piety and Zeal, of Humility and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal, of Patience and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, of Innocency and universal Charity in any Men as were in the <hi>Apostles;</hi> And therefore did appear with the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57894:36"/>
most proper <hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors</hi> from Heaven. And I dare venture the comparison of them with the best <hi>Philosophers,</hi> as to the greatest and most excellent <hi>virtues,</hi> for which they were the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired; notwithstanding the mighty difference as to their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; allowing but the same Truth as to the Story of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which we yield to <hi>Xenophon,</hi> or <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> or any other Writers concerning them.</p>
            <p>But what is it then which you object against the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> to make them inconsistent with the Wisdom of God? I find but two things in the Papers you sent me. 1. <hi>Want of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Power of Miracles, which you say is Promised.</hi> Mark
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57894:36"/>
16. 17. 2. <hi>The number of the Beast in the Revelations.</hi> But, Good Sir, consider, what it is to call in question a Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for such Objections as these are? Must there be no Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unless you understand eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prophecy, or the extent of every promise? Be not so inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to your own Soul, for the sake of such Objections, to cast away the great assurance which the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> gives us, as to the Pardon of Sin upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance here, and eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in another World. Would you reject all the Writings of <hi>Plato,</hi> because you do no more understand some part of his <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus</hi> than the number of 666? You must have a very nice faith, that can bear with no difficulties at all, so that if there be but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57894:37"/>
one or two hard things that you cannot digest, you must throw up all the best Food you have taken; at this rate you must starve your Body, as well as ruin your Soul. But of these places afterwards.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have hitherto removed the grounds of Suspicion, I now come to shew the positive Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of their <hi>Sincerity</hi> which the <hi>Apostles</hi> shewed, which were greater than were ever given to any other Matter of Fact in the <hi>World.</hi> I will then suppose the whole <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> to be reduced to this one Matter of Fact, Whether <hi>Christ did rise from the dead or no?</hi> for (as I have said already) it is plain, the <hi>Apostles</hi> put the main force of all that they said upon the <hi>Truth</hi> of this; and often declared, that they were appointed to be the

               <hi>Witnesses</hi> of this thing. Now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> at no long distance of time from the thing done. 3. If they te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie it plainly, and withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Testimony. 5. If they part with all that is valuable to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, rather than deny the Truth of what they have testified: And where all these concur, it is hardly possible to suppose greater evidence to be given of the <hi>Truth</hi> of a <hi>Thing;</hi> and now I shall shew that all these do exactly agree to the <hi>Apostles Testimony</hi> concerning the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They testified nothing but what they saw themselves. The <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nations</hi> do suppose that greater credit is to be given to <hi>eye witnesses</hi> than to any others, thence the Rule in the Civil Law <hi>Testimonium de auditu regulariter non valet:</hi> Because, say the <hi>Civilians</hi> and <hi>Canonists, Witnesses are to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the Truth, and not barely the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of things;</hi> that which Men see, they can testifie whether
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57894:39"/>
they are or not: That which Men only hear, may be, or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be; and their <hi>Testimony</hi> is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the <hi>Fact,</hi> but is looked on as more uncertain, and ought to have greater allowances given it; but the Apostles testified on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>what they saw and handled;</hi> and that after the most scrupulous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Christ Body,</hi> and after many <hi>doubts</hi> an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it; so that they did not seem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily and rashly to believe what they afterwards declared to the World. Now a <hi>Body</hi> was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object of Sense, and no try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al could be greater, or more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate than theirs was; nor an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> satisfaction fuller than putting their <hi>fingers</hi> into the very <hi>wound</hi> of the <hi>pierced side.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They did not stay till the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57894:39"/>
               <hi>circumstances</hi> might have slipt out of their Memories, before they testified these things; but very soon after, while the impression of them was fresh upon them: If they had let these Matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for any long time, the <hi>Jews</hi> would have asked them present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if these things were true, why did we not hear of them as soon as they were done? Therefore we see the Apostles on the very day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> a little after <hi>Christs ascension</hi> to Heaven, openly and boldly declare the <hi>Truth</hi> of these things, not in private corners among a few <hi>Friends,</hi> but in the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn meeting of their Nation from all parts; which was the worst time could have been cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, if they had any intention to deceive.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:57894:40"/>
3. They testifie it in as <hi>plain a manner</hi> as is possible, on purpose to prevent all mistakes of their meaning, <hi>This Jesus hath God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 32. 36.</note> 
               <hi>raised up, whereof we all are Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; Therefore let all the House of</hi> Israel <hi>know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</hi> Men that had a mind to deceive would have used some more general and doubtful words, than these were.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If this had been testified by one single witness, the World would have suspected the Truth of his Testimony; for according to the Rule in the <hi>Civil Law</hi> in the case of <hi>Testimony, Vox unius, vox nullius est:</hi> But this was testified by very many; not meerly by the twelve Apostles, but by 500 at once; among whom some
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57894:40"/>
might be supposed to have so much honesty, or at least capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being perswaded to have discovered the Imposture, if they had in the least suspected any.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But that which adds the greatest weight to all this, is, that there was not one of all the Apostles, and scarce any one of the rest, but exposed themselves to the utmost <hi>hazards</hi> and <hi>dangers,</hi> rather than deny or retract the <hi>Truth</hi> of what they witnessed. If the <hi>People</hi> had been careless and indifferent about <hi>Religion,</hi> it is possible Men might have gone on in a Lye so long till they had gotten <hi>interest</hi> enough to maintain it; but no sooner did the Apostles appear, witnessing these things, but they met with an early and vigorous opposition, and that from the chiefest Men in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57894:41"/>
               <hi>Power,</hi> who made it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to suppress them. Now in this case, they were put to this choice, if they would renounce or conceal the <hi>Truth</hi> of what they testified, they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently enjoy ease, and it may be, rewards too; but if they went on, they must look for nothing but the sharpest persecution; and this they met with almost in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and is it conceivable, that Men should be so <hi>fond</hi> of a <hi>lye,</hi> to forsake all and follow it, and at last to take up their cross for it? If <hi>credit</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> in the hearts of People, might carry a Man on a great way in the delusion, yet he would be loth to dye for it; and yet there was never a one of the Apostles, but ventured his life for the <hi>Truth</hi> of this; and all but one, they tell us, did suffer
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57894:41"/>
Martyrdom for it. I pray, Sir, consider, where you ever meet with any thing like this, that so many Men should so resolutely dye, for what themselves at the same time knew to be a lye; and that they must certainly do, if it were all a contrivance of their own heads.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But although in these things they went as high as it was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for <hi>humane Testimony</hi> to go, yet they had something beyond all this, which was a <hi>concurrence</hi> of a <hi>Divine Testimony,</hi> in the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous gifts</hi> and <hi>operations</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> And this we assert to be the highest Testimony can be given in the World, of a <hi>Truth</hi> of any thing; because <hi>God</hi> will not employ his <hi>Power</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the World. And as all other <hi>Truth</hi> hath a <hi>criterion</hi> proper
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57894:42"/>
to it; so this seems to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>criterion</hi> of a <hi>Divine Testimony,</hi> that it hath the <hi>power of Miracles</hi> going along with it. For if we do suppose God to make known his Mind to the World, it is very reasonable to believe there should be some <hi>distinguishing note</hi> of what is immediately from God, and what comes only from the <hi>inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Men;</hi> and what can be more proper to distinguish what comes from <hi>God,</hi> and what from <hi>Men,</hi> than to see those things done which none but <hi>God</hi> can do? But against this you object several things, which I shall easily and briefly Answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You cannot tell what it is that Miracles do attest; not all their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, since</hi> Paul <hi>said, some was not from the Lord.</hi> Answ. <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> do attest the <hi>veracity</hi> of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57894:42"/>
               <hi>Speaker,</hi> and by consequence the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Doctrin; not that you should believe that to be from the Lord, which he said was not;</hi> but that which he said, was from the Lord. But when he makes such a distinction himself, it is very unreasonable to urge that as an Argument, that he had <hi>nothing from the Lord;</hi> it is much rather an argument of his candor and ingenuity, that he would not pretend to <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> when he had it not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>You would have it signified, what Doctrin it is which is attested by Miracles, since the Doctrins of Scripture lye in heaps and confusion. Answ.</hi> To what purpose should any Doctrins be singled out to have the <hi>Seal</hi> of <hi>Miracles</hi> set to them, since it is their <hi>Divine Commission</hi> to Teach and declare
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57894:43"/>
the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is <hi>sealed</hi> by it? And what they did so Teach and declare, is easily known by their Writings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>But why do not Miracles still continue? Answ.</hi> Because there are no Persons employ'd to Teach any <hi>new Doctrines;</hi> and no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of <hi>Scripture</hi> doth imply any more: For the <hi>signs</hi> which were to follow them that believe, were such as tended to the first confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the <hi>Christian Faith;</hi> which being effected, their use ceased; and so to ask why God doth not continue a Gift of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> to convince Men that the former were true, is to the same purpose as to ask why <hi>God</hi> doth not make a <hi>New Sun,</hi> to satisfie <hi>Athiests</hi> that he made the <hi>Old?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>But doth not the Scripture say, that wonders are not always to be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57894:43"/>
taken as confirmations of the Truth of Doctrin, since false Prophets may work Wonders,</hi> Deuteron. 13. 1. <hi>Answ.</hi> That signifies no more, than that <hi>Wonders</hi> are not to be believed against the Principles of <hi>Natural Religion;</hi> or Revealed <hi>Religion</hi> already confirmed by <hi>greater Miracles:</hi> And that those who would value such a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>sign</hi> above all the <hi>series</hi> of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> their <hi>Religion</hi> was first esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by, may be justly left to their own <hi>delusions.</hi> You might as well object the lying Wonders of the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> against all the <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi> If God hath once done enough to convince Men, he may afterwards justly leave them to the tryal of their Ingenuity; as a Father that hath used great care to make his Son understand
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57894:44"/>
               <hi>true Coyn,</hi> may afterwards suffer <hi>false</hi> to be laid before him, to try whether he will mind his being cheated or no?</p>
            <p n="5">5. But you may yet farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>what the Testimony of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles doth signisie to the Writings of the New Testament? Answ.</hi> 1. The Miracles do sufficiently prove the <hi>Authority</hi> of that Doctrin, which was delivered by those who wrought <hi>Miracles;</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles.</hi> 2. If there had been the least ground to question the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of these <hi>Writings,</hi> they had never been so universally received in those <hi>Ages,</hi> when so many were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to enquire into the <hi>Truth</hi> of these things; for we see se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the <hi>Books</hi> were a long time examined, and at last, when no sufficient reason could
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57894:44"/>
be brought against them, they were received by those <hi>Churches,</hi> which at first scrupled the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them: And I am so far from thinking the <hi>doubts</hi> of the first <hi>Ages</hi> any Argument against the <hi>Authority</hi> of a <hi>Book,</hi> that by the objections of some against some of them, I am thereby assured, that they did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently receive any <hi>Book,</hi> because it went under the name of an <hi>Apostolical Writing:</hi> As I am the more confirmed in the belief of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> because some of the <hi>Disciples</hi> were at first very <hi>doubtful</hi> about it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. You may yet ask, <hi>What doth all this signifie to the Writings of the Old Testament, which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at a longer distance of Time from us, and in a more Ignorant Age of of the World?</hi> Answ. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57894:45"/>
be a <hi>more</hi> evident proof of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> than by the <hi>New:</hi> For if the <hi>New</hi> be <hi>true,</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> must be so, which was confirmed so plainly and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by it; our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> appealing to <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> on all occasions. So that the same <hi>Miracles</hi> which prove their <hi>Testimony</hi> true, do at the same time prove the <hi>Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> since it is so expresly said in the <hi>New, That Holy Men of God did speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all this, You urge, that you have discover'd such things in these Writings as could not come from God, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Contradictions in them.</hi> 2. <hi>Somethings inconsistent with the Wisdom of God.</hi> 3. <hi>Promises made that were never fulfilled.</hi> 4. <hi>Things so obscure
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57894:45"/>
as no one can tell the meaning of them.</hi> Under these four Heads I shall examin the particular allegations you bring against the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Under the head of <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi> you insist on the <hi>Prophecy</hi> Gen. 15. 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>made to</hi> Abraham <hi>concerning his Posterity; compared with the Accomplishment mentioned,</hi> Exod. 12. 40. 41. And the force of your Argument lyes in this, <hi>That the Prophecy in</hi> Genesis <hi>doth imply that the Servitude of the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>in</hi> Egypt <hi>was to be</hi> 40 <hi>Years; or</hi> 430 <hi>saith</hi> Exod. <hi>but both these are repugnant to other places of Scripture, which make their abode in</hi> Egypt <hi>not to exceed</hi> 215 <hi>Years; or at the highest, by the number of Generations could not exceed</hi> 350 <hi>Years, stretching them to the utmost advantage.</hi> To this which you lay so much
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57894:46"/>
weight upon, I Answer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By your own confession, supposing the 430 Years to begin from the <hi>Covenant</hi> made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the accomplishment mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 40. doth fall out exactly in the time of the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israels</hi> going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for you have proved from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that from the <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Jacobs</hi> being in <hi>Egypt,</hi> were 215 Years; to which you add, <hi>that</hi> Coath <hi>being suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> 5 <hi>Years Old at the going into</hi> Egypt; <hi>and that at</hi> 70 <hi>Years he Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat</hi> Amram, <hi>and that</hi> Amram <hi>at at</hi> 70 <hi>Begat</hi> Moses, <hi>to which</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <hi>his</hi> 80 <hi>Years being added, makes up the other</hi> 215 <hi>Years, whereby we have the full</hi> 430 <hi>Years, by your own computation.</hi> Now, Sir, I pray consider what reason you have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57894:46"/>
to charge the <hi>Scripture</hi> with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in a Matter your self acknowledges, so exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in this way of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But you say, <hi>the Words will not bear this; because they speak of the</hi> 400 <hi>Years to expire in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude in</hi> Egypt. Answ. For this we must consider the importance of the Words both in <hi>Genesis</hi> and <hi>Exodus.</hi> There is not a Word of <hi>Egypt</hi> mentioned in <hi>Genesis;</hi> but only in general it is said, <hi>Thy Seed shall be a Stranger in the Land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them</hi> 400 <hi>Years;</hi> and it will conduce very much to the right understanding this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> to consider the main scope and design of it, which was not to tell <hi>Abraham</hi> how long they should be in <hi>servitude</hi> to the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57894:47"/>
but how long it would be before his Seed should come to the <hi>possession</hi> of the promised <hi>Land;</hi> And it seems <hi>Abraham</hi> by the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> Gen. 15. 7. 8. did expect to have the Inheritance of this Land <hi>in his own time:</hi> To this therefore <hi>God</hi> Answers, by telling him, he meant no such thing, but it was intended for <hi>his Seed,</hi> and that not suddenly neither, for they were to tarry <hi>till the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the</hi> Amorites <hi>should be full,</hi> which would not be till the <hi>fourth Generation;</hi> and then <hi>his Seed should after</hi> 400 <hi>Years, come to the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Promised Land; but in the mean time they were to Sojourn in a Land that was not theirs, and to meet with many hardships and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> This is plainly the scope of this <hi>prophecy,</hi> and by atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, the great Objections
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57894:47"/>
presently appear without force; for the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Canaan</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Promise, was by the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> themselves looked on as a <hi>Land</hi> wherein they were <hi>Strangers.</hi> So <hi>Abraham</hi> saith <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 4. <hi>I am a Stranger and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer with you;</hi> and which is more remarkable in the blessing of <hi>Jacob</hi> by <hi>Isaac,</hi> to whom the <hi>Promise</hi> was made, it is said; <hi>And give thee the Blessing of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>to thee, and to thy Seed, that thou mayest inherit the Land wherein thou art a Stranger, which God gave unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 4. Where the very same Word is used concerning <hi>Jacob,</hi> that is expressed in the Prophecy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13. So that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> looked on themselves as <hi>Strangers in the Land of</hi> Canaan, so long after the <hi>promise</hi> made, and after
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57894:48"/>
the <hi>increase</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And therefore the <hi>land</hi> of <hi>Canaan</hi> was called <hi>Terra Peregrinationum,</hi> the <hi>Land</hi> wherein they were <hi>stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;</hi> Gen. 36. 7.—37. 1. And when <hi>God</hi> was calling the People of <hi>Israel</hi> together out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet then the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Canaan</hi> was called by the very same title, the <hi>Land of their Pilgrimage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were strangers: Exod.</hi> 6. 4. And <hi>Ps.</hi> 105. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. where we have a full account of the <hi>Promise</hi> made to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> concerning the <hi>inheritance</hi> of that <hi>Land</hi> it is said, <hi>that they were few, and strangers in it, when they went from one Nation to another, from one Kingdom to another People.</hi> Which doth fully explain the meaning of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> in <hi>Genesis,</hi> and that it is not to be restrained to the <hi>servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:57894:48"/>
of the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but to be understood of their <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> for 400 Years, wherein they were to suffer great hardships, before they should come to the Inheritance of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan. This is no forced or unnatural exposition of the Words,</hi> as you seem to suggest; but to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, very plain and easie, if we attend to the main scope and design of them which was to acquaint <hi>Abraham</hi> how long it would be before the <hi>prophecy</hi> were accomplished, and what the condition of his Seed should be the mean time, <hi>viz. That they should have no Land which they should call their own by Inheritance all that time, but they should be exposed to great hardships, yea even to Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; but that Nation whom they should serve, should at last suffer for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57894:49"/>
their ill usage of them, and they should come out of that Captivity with great substance; and all this to be done in the fourth Generation of the</hi> Amorites <hi>when their Iniquities should be arrived at the full height.</hi> All which particulars, were so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably accomplished at such a distance of time, and under such improbable circumstances, that that this very <hi>prophecy</hi> were enough to convince an unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced mind, that it came from Divine Inspiration. For where do we meet with any thing like this in the Histories of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? <hi>viz.</hi> A Prophecy to be accomplished 400 Years after, and the very manner foretold, which no humane conjecture could reach to, since the manner of deliverance of the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> out of their Captivity in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57894:49"/>
               <hi>Egypt,</hi> was to all humane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance so impossible a thing, especially at such a time when the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the People were sunk and broken by so long a slavery: And not only the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner foretold, but the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment happened to a day, according to <hi>Exodus</hi> 12. 41. <hi>And it came to pass at the end of the</hi> 430 <hi>Years, even the selfe-same day it came to pass, that all the Hosts of the Lord went out from the Land of</hi> Egypt. But against this you object, <hi>That the sojourning is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>in</hi> Egypt <hi>for</hi> 430 <hi>Years; which cannot hold good any ways; since, to make it up, the times of</hi> Abraham, Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>must be taken in who could not be called the Children of</hi> Israel. <hi>Answ.</hi> For the 430 Years, I grant, that according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:57894:50"/>
they did commence from the <hi>Covenant</hi> made to <hi>Abraham</hi> Gal. 3. 17. and that the 400 Years began from <hi>Isaac</hi>'s being owned for the <hi>Promised Seed;</hi> between which time the 30 Years were passed; and all appearance of difficulty is avoided, if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the reading of the best Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the <hi>LXX.</hi> which is in these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Now the sojourning of the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>who dwelt in</hi> Egypt <hi>and</hi> Canaan, <hi>they and their Fathers was</hi> 430 <hi>Years.</hi> This is the reading of our <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Copy, and the <hi>Complutensian,</hi> and that of <hi>Aldus,</hi> and of <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> in his <hi>Chronicon,</hi> and of St. <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Translation of it;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57894:50"/>
and of the <hi>Church</hi> in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustins</hi> time, and afterwards; and lest any should reject this as a late Interpolation, or gloss received into the Text, besides these Testimonies of the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, we find the very same in the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Copy, which the Enemies of it do allow to be as ancient as our <hi>Saviours</hi> time. And that which very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Truth of this reading is, that the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the sense of it, who are the most eager contenders for the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copy; who all agree, that the beginning of the Computation of the 430 Years is to be taken before the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israels</hi> going into <hi>Egypt:</hi> and <hi>Menasseh Ben Israel</hi> contends with many others, that the 430 Years did begin from
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57894:51"/>
the <hi>Promise</hi> made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the 400 from the time of <hi>Isaac,</hi> to which their most ancient <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Chronology</hi> do agree, and to the same purpose speak both <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> and <hi>Josephus;</hi> who although in one place he seems to make <hi>the</hi> Israelites <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction in</hi> Egypt <hi>to have been</hi> 400 <hi>Years,</hi> yet when he speaks more particularly of it, <hi>he makes the time of their abode in</hi> Egypt <hi>to have been only</hi> 215, <hi>and the</hi> 430 <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin from</hi> Abrahams <hi>entrance into</hi> Canaan: The <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> begins the 430 from the Vision of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the 400 from the Birth of <hi>Isaac;</hi> all which I mention, to let you see that the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves do in sense concur with the <hi>Samaritan</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Copy; and therefore we have more reason to suspect
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57894:51"/>
something left out in the present <hi>Hebrew,</hi> than any thing added in those Copies. <hi>But doth not this take off from the Authority of the Scripture?</hi> Not at all: For the only Question is about the True Reading: And having the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the <hi>Samaritan, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi> and other Copies of the <hi>LXX.</hi> and of the Ancient <hi>Church;</hi> and of the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as to the sense of it, we have reason to look on this as the truer Reading: Which is making no addition to the <hi>scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> either as to Persons or Places, but only producing the more Authentick Copy; much less is this Adding or Changing as we please, for if we did this without so much Authority as we have for it, you might as easily reject it as we produce it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:57894:52"/>
3. After all this, I do not see the mighty force of your Reason to charge the Scripture with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, supposing <hi>the</hi> 400 <hi>Years were to be spent in the servitude of the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>in</hi> Egypt. I confess, when I found the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> so boldly, so frequently charged with no less than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, I expected something like Demonstration in the Case, especially in this place which you chose to put in the Front of all; but I do not find any thing like such a proof of a Contradiction, supposing we should allow the 400 Years to be spent in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Yes, say you, Coath <hi>was</hi> 5 <hi>Years Old when he came down into</hi> Egypt, <hi>and When he had lived there</hi> 65 <hi>Years he begat</hi> Amram, <hi>and</hi> Amram <hi>being</hi> 70 <hi>Years Old begat</hi> Moses, <hi>to which</hi> Moses <hi>his</hi> 80 <hi>Years being
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57894:52"/>
added, we have only</hi> 215 <hi>Years.</hi> But since the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth not assign, the particular Age of any of these, when they begat their Children, I see no impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or repugnancy in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that 400 Years should pass from <hi>Levi</hi>'s going into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the Eightieth of <hi>Moses,</hi> any more than from <hi>Salmons</hi> entrance into <hi>Canaan</hi> to the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> for no more are reckoned in <hi>scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> than <hi>Boaz</hi> the Son of <hi>Salmon,</hi> by <hi>Raab,</hi> and <hi>Obed,</hi> and <hi>Jesse;</hi> So that by the same way, this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be explained, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer may be so too. If it be said, <hi>That either they begat their Children at a great Age, or that the scripture in Genealogies doth not set down all the intermediate Parents, but only the most eminent, (as</hi> Caleb <hi>is called the Son of</hi> Esron.

1 Chron. 2. 9, 18. <hi>although there was at least one between them,)</hi> the very same Answer will serve to clear this part of the <hi>Chronology</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> from any appearance of Contradiction. These things you might have found more largely deduced and fully handled by those Learned Persons, who have undertaken to clear the <hi>Chronology</hi> of <hi>Scripture:</hi> Who were men of more Judgment, than from any difficulty of this nature, to call in question the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>sacred Scriptures;</hi> and although the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Chronologers,</hi> are like the City Clocks, which seldom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, yet some come nearer the time of the day than others do; and therefore you ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and compare them before you pronounce so peremptorily
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57894:53"/>
about Contradictions in <hi>scripture,</hi> which you have no reason to do till you find that no one <hi>hypothesis</hi> among them will serve to free the <hi>scripture</hi> from Contradiction: For otherwise, you do but blame the <hi>Sun,</hi> because you cannot make the Clocks agree.</p>
            <p>This is all I can find in your Papers under the <hi>head</hi> of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; and I leave you now soberly to consider, whether this place did afford you sufficient ground for so heavy a Charge; but if you say, <hi>you have a great many more by you, but you sent me this only for a Tryal of my skill;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you send any more; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, Sir, to consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. How easily things do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be Contradictions to weak, or unstudied, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced minds, which after due
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57894:54"/>
consideration appear to be no such things. A deep prejudice finds a Contradiction in every thing; whereas in <hi>Truth,</hi> nothing but ill will, and impatience of considering, made any thing, it may be, which they Quarrel at, appear to be so. If I had been of such a quarrelsome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, I would have undertaken to have found out more Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in your Papers, than you imagin, and yet you might have been confident, you had been guilty of none at all. When I consider the great pains, and Learning, and Judgement, which hath been shewn by the <hi>Christian Writers</hi> in the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> and the raw, indigested Objections which some love to make against them, if I were to judge of things barely
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57894:54"/>
by the fitness of persons to judge of them, the disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these, would appear out of all comparison. A modest Man would in any thing of this nature say with himself, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, if there were such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions in the <hi>Bible,</hi> as now seem to me; so many persons of incomparable Abilities in the First, and latter Ages of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church, who have made it their business to enquire into these things, would have discerned them before me: And yet they retained a mighty vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the <hi>scriptures,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God himself; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be only weakness of Judgement, want of Learning, or some secret prejudice may make me suspect these things; or else I must suspect the honesty of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57894:55"/>
all those persons who have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended such a Devotion to the Scriptures, and yet have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them full of Contradictions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Wherein</hi> the Contradiction appears. Is it in the main and weighty parts of the <hi>Religion</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed herein; or is it only in some smaller Circumstances as to time and place? The great thing you are to look after, are the Matters those <hi>Scriptures</hi> tell you your Salvation depends upon; and if there be a full consent, and agreement therein; you find enough for you to believe and practice. And if some Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions should still appear to you in smaller Matters, what follows from thence, but only that the same care was not taken about little, as about great things? And you ought to set that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57894:55"/>
of Contradiction in small Matters, together with the real consent in the things of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est importance; and from thence rather to infer, that this was no combination or design to deceive others; for such persons take the greatest care to prevent suspicion, by their exactness in every minute Circumstance; and sometimes the over-much care to prevent suspicion doth raise it the more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>What ways</hi> have been used by Men of judgement and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to clear those places from the charge of Contradiction. For, not one of the Objections you can start now, but hath been considered over and over; and all the difficulties that belong to it examined; If you will not take the pains to do this; it is plain you do not desire satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57894:56"/>
but only seek for a pretence to cavil; especially, if you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly search the weakest or most injudicious Writers on the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and endeavour to expose their opinions, without taking notice of what others have said with more clear and evident Reason. This shews either want of Judgment in choosing such Expositors, or want of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and fair dealing and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of taking any advantage against the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How hard a Matter it is for us at this distance to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand exactly the grounds of <hi>Chronology,</hi> or the manner of computation of Times used so long ago: and therefore in all difficulties of this nature, we ought to make the fairest allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances that may be, considering
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57894:56"/>
withall, that escapes and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours are no where more easily committed by Transcribers, than in <hi>numbers:</hi> and that it is a very unreasonable thing, that a <hi>Book</hi> otherwise deserving to be thought the best <hi>Book</hi> in the World, should be scorned and rejected, because there appears some difference in the <hi>computation</hi> of <hi>times.</hi> We do not so exactly know the manner of the <hi>Hebrew Chronology,</hi> nor, the nature of their Year, or Intercalations, nor the customs of their <hi>Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies;</hi> nor the allowance to be made for <hi>interregnums,</hi> so as to be able to define peremptorily in these things; but it is sufficient to shew, that there is no impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in the accounts that are given; and no sufficient reason can be drawn from thence to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57894:57"/>
reject the Authority of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I come to consider the places you object, <hi>as containing things inconsistent with the Wisdom, or Goodness of God, according to a rational perswasion;</hi> and those are either, 1. <hi>From the Laws of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. 2. <hi>From the express story of the Bible, or actions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>From the Laws of</hi> Moses: Your <hi>first Objection</hi> is from <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>Where a Man is supposed to sell his Daughter; which you say, it is incredible to believe that God should permit; because it implies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural affection and covetousness in the Father.</hi> But, Sir, 1. You do not consider, that this is barely a <hi>provisional Law,</hi> and is not the <hi>permission</hi> of the thing, so much as the <hi>regulation</hi> of it, supposing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57894:57"/>
it to be done, <hi>i. e.</hi> in case a Man should part with his interest in his Daughter to another Person, upon an extraordinary case of necessity, as the <hi>Jews</hi> understand it; yet then, she was not to be in the condition of a Servant, but to be either Betrothed to the Person who receiv'd her, or to his Son; which was intended for the restraint of promiscuous Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Selling Daughters, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the satisfaction of Lust. The <hi>Jews</hi> who certainly best un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood their own Judicial <hi>Laws,</hi> do say, that this was never to be done, but where there was a presumption of such a <hi>betrothing;</hi> for no Man could Sell his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to those to whom it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for her to <hi>Marry</hi> by their <hi>Law;</hi> so that this was looked on as a kind of <hi>Espousals</hi> of a young
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57894:58"/>
Girle, taken into Wardship by another; but so, that if she were not Betrothed, she was to remain her 6 Years during her Minority, as the <hi>Jews</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it; unless she were redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or set Free, or the <hi>Jubile</hi> came, or the Master dyed, or the time of her Minority expired.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The case of <hi>necessity</hi> being supposed, it hath been thought lawful for <hi>Parents</hi> to make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by their <hi>Children,</hi> not only by the <hi>Jews,</hi> but by other Nations, who have been in the greatest esteem for Wisdom. For by the <hi>Law</hi> of the 12 <hi>Tables,</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> had the liberty of Selling his Son three times, for his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as <hi>Dionys. Halicarnas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus</hi> relates; and before that time, it was not only in use among
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57894:58"/>
the <hi>Romans,</hi> but in such esteem among them, that upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of their Laws the <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri</hi> durst not leave it out; but by one of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> it was restrained to the times before Marriage, for in case the <hi>Son</hi> had the <hi>Fathers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to Marry, he could not Sell him afterwards, as the same <hi>Author</hi> tells us. This <hi>Law</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in force among them, till <hi>Christianity</hi> prevailed in the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> for although there were a prohibition of <hi>Diocletian</hi> against it, yet that signified nothing, till <hi>Constantine</hi> took care, <hi>That such indigent Parents should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved out of the publick charge,</hi> Cod. Theodos. l. 11. tit. 27. 2. And yet after this, the Custom did continue, when the <hi>Parents</hi> were in great want, as appears by a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57894:59"/>
               <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> Cod. 3. tit. 3. <hi>Omnes quos Parentum miseranda for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna in servitium dum victum requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt addixit, ingenuitati pristinae reformentur.</hi> And it further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that even in <hi>Constantin's</hi> time, notwithstanding the Law made by him, <hi>Parents</hi> would still, when they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves overcharged with Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, part with their Interest in them to others for advantage, but it was chiefly while they were <hi>sanguinolenti,</hi> as the Law expresses it, <hi>i. e. new Born. Cod. Theod. l.</hi> 5. <hi>tit.</hi> 8. By the Laws of <hi>Athens,</hi> before <hi>Solons</hi> time, Parents might sell their Children, as appears by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Life; and the same <hi>Philostratus</hi> reports of the <hi>Phrygians, l.</hi> 3. <hi>vit. Apollon. Tyan.</hi> and the like custom doth obtain among the <hi>Chineses</hi> to this
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57894:59"/>
day, if persons do think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unable to bring up their <hi>Children</hi> themselves. And there are two things to be said for it. 1. The natural obligation lying on Children to provide for their Parents in necessity, by any way they are able. 2. The probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of better Education under more able Persons; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Thebans</hi> had a Law, <hi>That</hi> Parents <hi>in case of poverty, were to bring their</hi> Children <hi>to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, as soon as they were Born, who put them out to such as were judged</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>AElian. v. hist. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>fit to bring them up, and to have their service for their reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But however,</hi> you say, <hi>This place implys a toleration of having many Wives, because it is said, if he take him another Wife, v.</hi> 10. I do not deny, that the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law did suppose the practice of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57894:60"/>
               <hi>Polygamy;</hi> but as it doth no where expressly allow it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it expressly condemn it. And although we say, the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Law</hi> is far more excellent, which reduceth Marriage to its first institution; yet you will find it a hard Matter to prove such a permission of <hi>Polygamy</hi> as this was, to be so repugnant to the <hi>Law</hi> and Principles of <hi>Nature,</hi> as from thence to infer, that this <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> could not be from <hi>God:</hi> You might have said the same about the Matter of <hi>Divorce,</hi> which was permitted them; <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their hearts:</hi> Which shews, that <hi>God</hi> doth not always require that from Men which is best plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to himself; and that as to his <hi>Political Government,</hi> he may not always punish that, which is not so pleasing to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:57894:60"/>
The next Law you quarrel at is that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 13, <hi>&amp;c. About the tryal of Virginity:</hi> Which you object against, <hi>as immodest, and uncertain, and therefore unbecoming the Wisdom of God.</hi> So, many customs of those elder times of the World, and of the <hi>Eastern</hi> parts to this day seem very strange to us, that are not so well acquainted with the <hi>Reasons</hi> of them. Methinks, it better becomes our <hi>Modesty</hi> in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to question our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding those customes, than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to cast so much disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Author of them. If you had been offended at the literal sense of those Words, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves say, they are to be understood figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively of the evidence that was to be brought and laid open
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57894:61"/>
before the <hi>Judges,</hi> on behalf of the defamed Person. And both <hi>Josephus</hi> and <hi>Philo</hi> omit the laying open the Cloth. But supposing it to be taken in the plainest lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sense, I have Two Things to say in vindication of this Law. 1. That however uncertain some <hi>Physitians</hi> have thought that way of Tryal to have been in these parts of the World; yet it is generally agreed to have held for the <hi>Eastern</hi> parts, by the most skilful <hi>Physitians</hi> among the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians:</hi> And a custom of the same nature is said by good Authors to have been observed among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and other <hi>Africans,</hi> as well as the <hi>Arabians;</hi> so that this could not be thought so strange or immodest among the Inhabitants of those parts: And it is very probable that some
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57894:61"/>
particulars, as to the Practice of these <hi>Laws</hi> are not set down, which might very much tend to the certainty of them, as the Age of the Married Persons, which was most likely then, as it is to this day in the <hi>Eastern</hi> parts, very early, the <hi>Jews</hi> say, at 12 years old, which would make the Tryal more certain. 2. As to the Modesty of it, you are to consider, that the <hi>Law</hi> was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to keep persons from unjust <hi>defamations,</hi> and such a way of <hi>Tryal</hi> was therefore pitched upon to deter persons from such defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; which Men might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have been more ready to, because of the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>divorce,</hi> and the advantage they had in saving the <hi>dower,</hi> if they could prove the party vitiated before Marriage; therefore all the proof
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57894:62"/>
of that Nature was to be passed soon after the consummation of Marriage, which being agreed then by all the Friends, there was to be no liberty left for defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation afterwards; but in case any Man should be guilty of it, the producing those Evidences, which before they were agreed upon, should be sufficient to clear the Innocency of the party accused. And therefore I look on this <hi>Law,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> do on that of the <hi>rebellious son,</hi> of which they say, that there is no instance of the practice of it; the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty threatned being so effectual to prevent the occasion of it.</p>
            <p>And such in a great Measure, I suppose the other <hi>Law</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by you to have been, <hi>viz. of the Water of Jealousy,</hi> which you make so strange a matter of;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57894:62"/>
and think it <hi>savours too much of a design to gratify the jealous humour of the Jewish Nation:</hi> But you might have put a fairer constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was intended to prevent any occasion of suspicion being given to the Husband, by too much familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with other persons; since the Law allowed so severe a Trial, in Case the Wife after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition did not forbear such suspected familiarity, but if you had looked on the Law, as it is, Num. 5. 12, 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you would have found, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of it was to keep Women from committing <hi>secret Adultery,</hi> by so severe a Penalty; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all allowing so much to a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable suspicion, (for so the <hi>Jews</hi> understand it, with many Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Limitations) that rather
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57894:63"/>
then Married persons should live under perpetual jealousies, he appointed this extraordinary way of Tryal, whereby Adultery was most severely punished, and the honour of Innocency publickly vindicated; which certainly are not ends at all unbecoming due Conceptions of God.</p>
            <p>The last of the <hi>Jewish Laws,</hi> which you quarrel with is <hi>the prohibition of Usury, in several places of Moses his Law and the Psalms:</hi> And from hence you fall into a long Discourse <hi>to prove the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Usury:</hi> But to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I beseech you? For you were to prove, that <hi>God</hi> could never forbid it; you might have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>your pity for Men,</hi> as you think, <hi>Blinded with superstition, and chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with New and Aëry Notions:</hi> For by all that I can see by these
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57894:63"/>
Papers, some pretended Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to <hi>superstition</hi> have no better Eyes than their Neighbours, and are as easily cheated with ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Fancies and Aëry imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The only thing to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness in that long Discourse is this, <hi>That you cannot imagine that God should make a Law so much to Mans inconvenience, and forbid him so nice and indifferent a thing, as Moderate increase of profit by letting out of Money, when it is allowed upon Lands, Houses, and Trade,</hi> &amp;c. To this I Answer, that the prohibition of <hi>Usury,</hi> to the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish Nation,</hi> was upon <hi>political Grounds</hi> peculiar to the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that <hi>People;</hi> as appears by the words of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 19, 20. <hi>Thou shalt not lend to Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto thy Brother—Unto a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thou maist lend upon Usury;</hi> but
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57894:64"/>
none of the <hi>Laws</hi> which are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon common and Moral Reasons have such Limitations as this; for God would never have said, <hi>Thou shalt not commit Adultery with thy Brothers Wife;</hi> but <hi>with the Wife of a Stranger thou maist.</hi> But there was this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reason, for the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Usury</hi> to the <hi>Jewish Nation:</hi> It pleased God to fix their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, not upon the Sea-side, as <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> stood; but within Land where they had no conveniencies of Trading, but the Riches of the <hi>Nation</hi> lay in <hi>Agriculture</hi> and <hi>Pasturage:</hi> In which the Returns of Money are neither so quick nor so advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to make sufficient compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Interest of the Money in the time they have it: For the main thing valuable in Money is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57894:64"/>
the advantage the borrower makes of it; and where that is great, it seems reasonable that the person whose the Money is, should have a proportionable share of the advantage made by it; but where persons borrow only for present occasions to supply their necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, there it is only an Act of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to lend, and it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable to press upon, or take advantage by anothers necessities. And this seems to have been the case among the <hi>Jews;</hi> they were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Poor that wanted Money for present necessities; the Rich had no way to imploy it in Trading, unless that they lent to the <hi>Tyrian Merchants,</hi> which it was lawful by their Law to do; now if they took <hi>Usury</hi> of their own people, it must be of those whose urgent necessity, and not hopes of a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57894:65"/>
mighty increase by it made them borrow, and therefore it was a very just and reasonable <hi>Law</hi> to forbid <hi>Usury</hi> among them: which I believe he would never have done, if he had placed the <hi>Jews</hi> upon the Coasts of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> where Trading was so much in request.</p>
            <p>These are all the <hi>Laws</hi> which you have picked out of the <hi>whole</hi> Body of the <hi>Jewish Law,</hi> to represent it unbecoming the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> And now I pray Sir, look back again upon them, see how few, how small, how weak your Objections are; and compare them with the <hi>weight,</hi> and <hi>justice,</hi> and <hi>prudence,</hi> and <hi>piety,</hi> expressed in all the rest, and I hope you will find cause to be ashamed of speaking so har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shly of those <hi>Laws,</hi> so well
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57894:65"/>
accommodated to those Ages of the World, and the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that <hi>People</hi> for whom they were appointed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I now consider what you object against the <hi>story</hi> of the <hi>Bible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That passage of</hi> Moses; Exod. 32. 32. <hi>Blot me out of thy Book which thou hast written:</hi> Where your design is to shew <hi>that</hi> Moses <hi>prayed to be Damned, and that this was a very irrational thing: And savouring more of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than of the Spirit of God.</hi> But what if <hi>Moses</hi> meant no such thing as Damnation? As there is not any word in the Context relating that ways, but all the design of that Chapter is about a Temporal punishment, which was a present Destruction of the People for their sins. And the Book out of which he prayed
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57894:66"/>
               <hi>God to blot him,</hi> seems to me to be no other, than the Roll of <hi>Gods chosen people, who were to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the Land of</hi> Canaan: For so <gap reason="foreign">

the Wilderness rather than the People:</hi> And God gives that Answer to this purpose, v. 33. <hi>Whoever hath sinned against me, will I blot out of my Book,</hi> the sense of which is the same with those words of the <hi>Psalmist, he sware in his wrath that they should not enter into his Rest. Psal.</hi> 95, 11. And according to this interpretation, which is most natural and easie, all your long Discourse <hi>against praying to be Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> comes to just nothing; there being no pretence for it, either in the Text or Context.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>story</hi> of <hi>Ruth</hi> doth not please you, <hi>as savouring in your opinion of a great deal of Immodesty;</hi> but you would have a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it, if you consider that the reason of her carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Boaz,</hi> in such a manner, was upon <hi>Naomies</hi> telling her <hi>that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57894:67"/>
he was one to whom the right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption did belong, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> by their Law, <hi>was to Marry her. Ruth</hi> 2. 20. And this <hi>Ruth</hi> pleaded to <hi>Boaz, Ruth</hi> 3. 9. By which it appears, that she verily believed that he was <hi>legally</hi> her Husband; and <hi>Boaz</hi> we see speaks of her <hi>as one that was a vertuous Woman, and known to be such in the whole City.</hi> v. 11. And he confesses <hi>he was her near kinsman, only</hi> he saith, <hi>there was one nearer.</hi> v. 12. By which it seems, if there had not, <hi>Boaz</hi> had made no Scruple of the matter: And the <hi>Jews</hi> say, in such Marriages very little <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> was required, if the next of <hi>kin</hi> did not renounce his right, because the <hi>Law</hi> had determined the <hi>Marriage</hi> before hand. If you had but considered this one
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57894:67"/>
thing, you would have spared the many <hi>Observations</hi> you make on this story.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You Object against 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>as too much countenancing either Incest or Adultery, because it is said, that God gave to</hi> David <hi>his Masters Wives into his Bosom.</hi> But 1. It is very strange to bring this place as a countenance to <hi>Adultery,</hi> which was purposely designed to upbraid <hi>David</hi> with the sin of <hi>Adultery;</hi> and you will find it no easie matter, by the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the <hi>Mosaical Law,</hi> to prove <hi>Polygamy</hi> to be <hi>Adultery.</hi> 2. The <hi>Jews</hi> give a fair Interpretation of this place, for they say, that the <hi>Wife</hi> of a <hi>King</hi> could never <hi>Marry</hi> after her Husbands decease, as the <hi>Gemara</hi> on the Title <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> expresly saith, although some among
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57894:68"/>
them follow the opinion of <hi>R. Jehuda,</hi> that she might Marry the succeeding <hi>King;</hi> but that is built chiefly on this place; of which the rest give a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>viz.</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57894:68"/>
the <hi>Jews</hi> than other Writers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You are much offended <hi>at Hosea</hi>'s <hi>Marrying an Adulteress:</hi> But all the formidable difficulties of that place will presently vanish, if you allow the <hi>Prophetical Schemes,</hi> wherein those things are said to be done, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to represent in a more lively manner the things signified by them. And so you may see the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase,</hi> fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains this place of <hi>Hosea</hi> and <hi>Maimonides</hi> purposely discourseth on the <hi>Prophetick parables,</hi> and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maim. Moro Nevoch. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 46.</note> brings this as one of the instances of them; and with him the rest of the <hi>Jewish Interpreters</hi> agree. But you Object against such a way of Teaching, <hi>as tending to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Vice,</hi> which it is very far from, being designed to represent the odiousness of it:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57894:69"/>
For the whole Scope of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> is to let the People under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that their <hi>Idolatry</hi> was as hateful to <hi>God</hi> as the sin of <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> and that the consequence of it would be their Misery and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. And yet that <hi>God</hi> expressed as much tenderness to them, as a Man that was very fond of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would do, in being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to put her away, although he knew she were false to his Bed: the former is intended in the first <hi>Chapter,</hi> and the latter in the third. And what is there tending to Immorality in all this? May not <hi>God</hi> make use of one Vice, whose evil is more notorious to represent another by, whose evil they are more hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of? May not he set forth a <hi>Degenerate People</hi> by the <hi>Sons</hi> of an <hi>Adulteress?</hi> And by the Names
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57894:69"/>
given to them express his detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their wickedness? Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the <hi>Parabolical</hi> Terms are so clearly explained, as they are in the second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>But you will say, <hi>these things are related as plain matters of Fact: with the several circumstances belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to them.</hi> It is true, they are so, but so Parables use to be; so was <hi>Nathan</hi>'s to <hi>David;</hi> so is that of the Rich Man and <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> in the <hi>New Testament;</hi> so is <hi>Jeremies</hi> going to <hi>Euphrates to hide</hi>

We that are accustomed to another way of Learning, think these things strange; but this was a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way in the <hi>elder</hi> times, and it is to this day much used in the <hi>Eastern Countries,</hi> to represent <hi>Duties</hi> to some, under the <hi>Parables</hi> of things as really done by others: As may be seen in <hi>Locman</hi> and <hi>Perzoes,</hi> besides what <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> and others have said, concerning the <hi>Antiquity</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use of this <hi>Parabolical</hi> way of Teaching.</p>
            <p>I now come to your Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57894:70"/>
against the <hi>New Testament:</hi> but I find them so few, and those so slight and inconsiderable, as to the end for which you produce them, that I may easily pass them over.

               <hi>all things:</hi> Which amounts to a Hundred-fold in this life.</p>
            <p>But certainly you are the first Man, Who have Objected <hi>the obscurity of the Book of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, againgst the Authority of the Scriptures:</hi> Which is just as if one should Object the <hi>quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the <hi>Circle</hi> against <hi>Mathematical certainty.</hi> If we grant that there are some things in that <hi>Mystical Book,</hi> we do not yet well understand; what then!

all that I have Written, in order to your <hi>satisfaction.</hi> If you think fit to return an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, I pray do it clearly and shortly, and with that freedom from Passion, which becomes so weighty a Matter: And I beseech <hi>God</hi> to give you a right understanding in all things.</p>
