            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">§. 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He late Author of the <hi>Originall, and end of Civill Power,</hi> under the name of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tactus Philodemius,</hi> hath thought fit to queſtion two things ſet downe by Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> in his <hi>Addreſſe to the Generall, and Counſell of War.</hi>
               <note place="margin">page 5.</note> The firſt is this <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, That the Jew under Gods own Government might wholly give up himſelfe, and his Freedome to his Maſters will (the power of life being onely exempted) and by having his eare bored, might of a free-man, become a ſlave for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. The ſecond is this <hi>Queſtion, Whether ever any man was by God or Nature invested with power over his owne Life,</hi> i. e.<note place="margin">page 18.</note> 
               <hi>to take away his owne life, or to kill himſelf</hi>?</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. This <hi>Affirmation,</hi> and this <hi>Queſtion,</hi> he willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, and is content that the <hi>Queſtion</hi> ſhall be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a down-right <hi>Negation, That never any man was by God, or Nature inveſted with power over his owne life, or power to kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi> And having thus confeſt the citation, as farre as concernes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103955:3"/>
him, it remaines, that I proceed to juſtifie, both parts of it. And to that end, I ſhall think my ſelfe ſufficiently fortified by two advantages, which that <hi>Authour</hi> hath been pleaſed to allow me in this matter.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. Firſt, that it is not any opinion of Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> but the plaine words of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which are under his name, thus oppoſed by this Authour in both places. The former is <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, Exodus</hi> 21. at the beginning, <hi>If the ſervant ſhall plainly ſay, I love my Maſter, &amp;c. I will not goe out free, Then his Maſter ſhall bring him to the Judges, &amp;c. And his Maſter ſhall bore his eare thorow with an awle, and he ſhall ſerve him for ever.</hi> And againe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.16. <hi>And it ſhall be, if he</hi> (i. e. <hi>the ſervant ſet free at the Sabbatick year) ſay unto thee, I will not goe away from thee, &amp;c. Then thou ſhalt take an awle, and thruſt it thorow his ear unto the door, and he ſhall be thy ſervant for ever, and alſo to thy hand-maide thou ſhalt doe likewiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. That a plaine place of <hi>Scripture</hi> ſhould be thus miſtaken for an Aſſertion of Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> I am not permitted to ſuſpect, becauſe that <hi>Author</hi> hath to his mention of the Doctors Name added the teſtimony of <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. which, though it be a miſtake, I ſuppoſe, of the Printer, for <hi>Ex.</hi> 21. will yet be a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent teſtimony of that <hi>Authors</hi> opinion, that Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> had <hi>Moſes</hi> on his ſide, and conſequently, that both were to be involv'd by him in the ſame condemnation.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. The ſame, I ſuppoſe, I may aſſume of the other <hi>Negation</hi> queſtioned by him, that 'tis in Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> but the repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the 6. Commandement [<hi>thou ſhalt not kill</hi>] according to the latitude, wherein all Jewiſh, and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writers have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted it to the prohibition of <hi>ſelf-murder,</hi> as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him at large in another place.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pract. Cat.</hi> l. 2. ſect. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. Having mentioned this firſt <hi>advantage</hi> againſt this <hi>Author,</hi> ſufficient certainly to ſecure Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> from his blame, and to make any <hi>Apologie</hi> for him unneceſſary, and well-nigh ſcandalous (the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> being able to plead its owne cauſe, without the aſſiſtance of any humane <hi>Advocate</hi>) I have yet the benefit of a ſecond kindneſſe allowed me by this unknowne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary; which, though <hi>Scripture</hi> were not of Authority with him, would encourage the Doctor not to fear the falling under
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103955:3"/>
his diſpleaſure. That is, the unreconcileableneſſe of thoſe two opinions (the one with the other) which he is pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to Doctor <hi>Hammond, viz.</hi> that it ſhould be <hi>unlawfull</hi> for a <hi>Jew</hi> to give up his <hi>Freedome,</hi> (and that <hi>ſervitude</hi> ſhould be, as he calls it, an <hi>unnaturall ſervitude</hi>) and yet that it ſhould be put in his power by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> (for that is to affirme it <hi>lawfull,</hi> and agreeable to <hi>Nature</hi>) to take away his own <hi>Life,</hi> or to kill himſelfe. For it being by <hi>Job</hi> mentioned as an <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature, that a man will <hi>for his life give all he hath</hi>; and in the accounts and practiſes of all men, that of <hi>Liberty</hi> being part of that <hi>all</hi>; It will conſequently be unreaſonable, and impoſſible for him that hath once affirmed the parting with ones freedome to be an <hi>unnaturall ſervitude,</hi> to deny the <hi>killing of himſelf</hi> to be an <hi>unnaturall murther</hi>; And therefore, having ſo faire ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages before me, not onely the <hi>Scripture in terminis</hi> on my ſide, but this <hi>Adverſary,</hi> by ſo eaſie a conſequence, become my <hi>Second</hi> alſo, I am (not unwillingly) perſwaded to tender a brief reply to thoſe reaſons, which ſeeme to have drawn this Author into this caſuall diſpute, and to endeavour the preventing of thoſe Errours; to which, a <hi>Philodemius,</hi> or <hi>popular</hi> diſputer may in ſuch an Age of <hi>Licentiouſneſſe</hi> betray others.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. To the caſe of the <hi>Jewiſh Servant,</hi> giving up his <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> to his <hi>Maſter,</hi> (which was by the Doctor mentioned out of <hi>Moſes</hi>) the Authour hath framed three <hi>Anſwers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. The firſt, <hi>That it cannot be affirmed upon good and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant grounds, that from nature the Jew had any ſuch power, but that God onely permitted it to be ſo; and the Jew, by this unnaturall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude to his maſter, was a fit type of that ſlavery that man ſhould be in unto Sin, to obey it in the luſts thereof; for his ſervants we are whom we obey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. To this I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That the affirmation of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Scripture, [That this was <hi>permitted by God</hi> to the <hi>Jewes</hi>] is to me a <hi>good and pregnant ground</hi> that the <hi>Jew</hi> had this power under <hi>Gods own Government,</hi> which is all that he affirmes to be affirmed by Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> in that place; and therefore, the putting in thoſe other words [<hi>Of the Jewes not having it from Nature</hi>] ſeemes to be on purpoſe deſigned to take off from the <hi>clearneſſe,</hi> and the <hi>pregnancy</hi> of the probation, and ſo onely
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103955:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to darken, but not to invalidate the argument.</p>
            <p n="11">§. 11. But then ſecondly, I adde, that <hi>Gods permitting</hi> any thing to any man, is a <hi>pregnant</hi> argument, that from <hi>Nature</hi> that man <hi>hath that power:</hi> If by <hi>Power</hi> we mean a <hi>morall power,</hi> or <hi>power</hi> of doing it <hi>without Sin</hi>; And if by <hi>Gods permiſſion</hi> we underſtand his <hi>Approbation,</hi> as of a lawfull fact. For, thus it is certaine, that <hi>God</hi> never ſo <hi>permits,</hi> as to <hi>approve</hi> (or not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite) any thing, which by the <hi>Law of Nature may</hi> not be done <hi>without ſinne.</hi> For the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> being the <hi>Law of God,</hi> as truly as any <hi>poſitive Law</hi> of his promulgating; and <hi>God</hi> in all his <hi>Lawes</hi> being conſtant to himſelfe, ſo farre as never to <hi>prohibit,</hi> and <hi>permit</hi> the ſame thing at the ſame time to the ſame men; It is moſt certaine, that what <hi>God</hi> thus <hi>permits, Nature permits</hi> alſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> Leaves it <hi>lawfull</hi> to be done, or poſſible without <hi>Sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">§. 12. But if by <hi>Permiſſion</hi> this <hi>Author</hi> meanes no more then diſpenſation, or grant of preſent <hi>Impunity,</hi> ſuch as in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Common-wealth was (for the <hi>hardneſſe of their hearts</hi>) allowed in the buſineſſe of <hi>divorce,</hi> or (for the multiplying of them) in polygamy, then it will ſure reſt upon him to <hi>prove,</hi> and not only, as he ſaith, to <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> thus (and thus only) permitted it to be ſo: But this I ſhall ſuppoſe impoſſible to be proved, though it cannot lie upon me to demonſtrate the <hi>Negative,</hi> nor ſhall I ſo much fear the probableneſſe of his unprov'd groundleſſe <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> as to endeavour it. For indeed, what degree of <hi>likeneſſe</hi> is there betwixt thoſe <hi>divorces</hi> and <hi>polygamies,</hi> (which were ſuch inordinate <hi>Liberties</hi>) and this other of diveſting himſelfe of <hi>Liberty?</hi> Only the ſame that is betwixt two <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">§. 13. I ſhall not need further to inſiſt on this, both for the plaine words of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and becauſe it is the acknowledgment of this very Author, page 18. <hi>That this may lawfully be done for the obtaining of a greater good,</hi> which being compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. makes up a demonſtration, that a man hath this <hi>power, i. e.</hi> that he may <hi>lawfully</hi> doe it. For 'tis not the intuition of the greateſt <hi>morall good,</hi> much leſſe of the greateſt <hi>advantage</hi> to my ſelf, or any other, that may make that <hi>lawfull</hi> which in it ſelf is <hi>unlawfull,</hi> or which by <hi>nature</hi> man hath not <hi>power</hi> to doe.</p>

            <p n="22">§. 22.

            <p n="24">§. 24. One thing more there is, which I may be allowed to adde, (having thus farre reply'd to all his anſwers) that the concluſion which was in the <hi>Addreſſe</hi> inferr'd from that practice of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> was farther confirm'd by the practice of diverſe <hi>Heathens,</hi> who can neither be excuſed by the pretence of a <hi>permiſſion,</hi> or ſpeciall <hi>diſpenſation</hi> from <hi>God</hi> to doe unnaturall things (as he thinks may be affirmed of the <hi>Jew</hi>) nor yet were obſerved by the moſt rational <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> to have done any thing contrary to <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> in changing abſolute Liberty for ſomewhat which ſeemed better, and more advantagious to them, to wit, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and <hi>protestion, i. e.</hi> in changing a ſtate of common <hi>hoſtility,</hi> (the unhappieſt lot in nature) for that other (ſet down by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> as the object of their Chriſtian <note n="*" place="margin">

I ſhall adde no more to the vindicating of the firſt propoſition, till I meet with the <hi>temptation</hi> of better, or more dangerous <hi>arguments</hi> againſt it.</p>
            <p n="25">§. 25. I proceed as briefly to the ſecond, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the <hi>Addreſſe</hi> by way of <hi>queſtion, Whether ever any man was by God, or Nature, inveſted with power of his owne Life,</hi> i. e. <hi>with power to take away his owne Life, to kill himſelfe?</hi> The vindicating of which, I muſt acknowledge a taske, to which I did not expect, that the Doctor ſhould be call'd; having not, till now, been ſo fully convinced of the danger, and

ill conſequences of favouring the exceſſes of thoſe mens wits, who have maintained <hi>paradoxes,</hi> or of the improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thoſe that have tempted others by the publiſhing of them.</p>
            <p n="26">§. 26. For certainly about two yeares ſince, before the time, that the <hi>poſtthumous</hi>

            <p n="26">§. 26. As it is, I ſhall not endeavour to perſwade my ſelfe (as the <hi>Pyrrhonian</hi> in <hi>Sextus Empiricus,</hi> would teach me to do) that I was in a dream, when I read D. <hi>Hammond</hi> cited, and confuted for thus affirming; I muſt rather provide for the encounter, and haſten to <hi>anſwer</hi> the <hi>arguments,</hi> which this Author hath offered againſt this branch of the ſixt <hi>commandement</hi> (as he met with it in the Doctors hands) or elſe twill be poſſible this opinion may gather <hi>Proſelytes</hi> alſo in this age, wherein nothing can be ſaid ſo incredible, which ſome men doe not make a ſhift to take up, and believe very contentedly.</p>
            <p n="27">§. 27. His firſt argument is drawne from the Doctors Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, that <hi>man hath power from God and Nature over his owne

body to cut, and lance it, and over his owne freedome to paſſe it away,</hi> from whence, if he doe any thing, he muſt undertake to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that <hi>therefore he hath power over his life</hi> alſo; And to doe that, he muſt make good theſe three things:</p>
            <p n="28">§. 28. 1. That ſince the confutation of the former propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he hath now chang'd his minde, and agrees with Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> that a man hath from <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Nature power</hi> over <hi>his freedome to paſſe it away,</hi> (for otherwiſe, though it will be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> who <hi>confeſt</hi> it, yet will it not be of uſe to himſelf who profeſſeth the contrary) and again that he hath forgotten, what in his very laſt period he had affirmed [<hi>that God doth not intruſt and allow any man to have power to deſtroy his owne image,</hi> i. e. <hi>to take away mans life, but him, or them whom he makes Gods,</hi> i. e. <hi>Magiſtrates to whom he deputes his owne place</hi>] for ſure it cannot be thought, that every <hi>private man</hi> in the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> is ſuch a <hi>Vicegerent of God,</hi> or <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="29">§. 29. 2. That the <hi>argument, à minori ad majus affirmativè,</hi> is valid, againſt all <hi>Logicke,</hi> viz: That he that hath power over the <hi>body,</hi> or over <hi>freedome,</hi> is ſuppoſed to have <hi>power over Life alſo,</hi> and ſo that the <hi>Surgeon,</hi> that may ſcarify the fleſh, or <hi>cut</hi> off an Arme, may therefore as Lawfully <hi>ſlaſh</hi> the throate, and <hi>cut off</hi> the <hi>head</hi> alſo, and in like manner that the Maſter by being ſuch, is become the <hi>Judge</hi> of his Servant, and hath among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>Life,</hi> which he hath ſeldome been allowed among the worſt of Heathens.</p>
            <p n="30">§. 30. And 3. That <hi>God,</hi> which hath put ſomething in our power, is thereby obliged to reſerve nothing to himſelfe; Or that by giving us the <hi>uſus fructus,</hi> or benefits of Life, he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us the abſolute <hi>dominion,</hi> and propriety of it alſo.</p>
            <p n="31">§. 31. But without either of theſe 3 more difficult under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, the <hi>Authour</hi> hath attempted an eaſier way, by ſuppoſing that neither <hi>cutting of fleſh,</hi> nor <hi>Parting with freedome may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by God or Nature, unleſſe they referre to ſuch an end, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a farre greater good is to be enjoyed, and obtained: that cutting or lancing (without this neceſſary circumſtance of a greater good) is a ſtep or degree toward ſelfe murther,</hi> &amp;c. From whence the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,</hi> I ſuppoſe, muſt be, that by the ſame reaſon the <hi>Killing</hi> of ones <hi>ſelfe,</hi> may then alſo be conceiv'd allowable by <hi>God,</hi> when

it is referr'd by me to ſuch an <hi>end,</hi> whereby a far <hi>greater good is to be enjoyed,</hi> and <hi>obtained,</hi> but never elſe.</p>
            <p n="32">§. 32. To which I ſhall make theſe clear Replyes, 1. That a thing directly <hi>forbidden</hi> by God, cannot be thought approveable by him, upon the referring of it to a <hi>morall</hi> (much leſſe if it be but an <hi>advantagious</hi> or <hi>profitable) good</hi> end. <hi>Their damnation is juſt, that ſay, they may doe evill that good may come:</hi> And that this is not a <hi>begging</hi> of the <hi>queſtion</hi>; but that, indeed, <hi>ſelf-homicide is</hi> evill, and forbidden by <hi>God,</hi> will be clear by remembring theſe three things, 1. That the command of not <hi>killing,</hi> is <hi>indefinite</hi>; and that he that <hi>kils himſelfe,</hi> doth certainly <hi>kill,</hi> that he that <hi>ſheds his own bloud, ſheds</hi> the <hi>bloud</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi>: and 2. That the <hi>Image of God</hi> reſiding on him (which is the <hi>ground</hi> of this prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition in <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 9.6.) is as truly ſo, when 'tis beheld in the <hi>reflexion,</hi> as when in the <hi>direct line,</hi> in my ſelf, as in any other man. 3. That the power of <hi>Life</hi> is <hi>Reſerved</hi> a peculiar to <hi>God,</hi> and not communicated to the Creature, (ſave onely to his <hi>Vice-gerent</hi>) which may thus appear. <hi>God</hi> as the <hi>Creator</hi> of the World, and ſole doner of <hi>life</hi> muſt be acknowledged to have the <hi>dominion</hi> over it: This <hi>dominion</hi> conſequently is <hi>communicated</hi> to none but to thoſe to whom by <hi>God</hi> it is <hi>communicated</hi>; To the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> this <hi>power</hi> is given by that Law of <hi>God,</hi> whereby he preſcribes the putting certain Malefactors to <hi>Death</hi>; and whereby he conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutues the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> his <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> on Earth, and ſo the <hi>execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner</hi> of that <hi>Law, an avenger for wrath, Rom.</hi> 13. And whoſoever will challenge the like <hi>power,</hi> muſt ſhew the like <hi>charter,</hi> and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and if he cannot doe that, that is ſufficient to prove that he <hi>hath</hi> it not; As 'tis ſufficient to <hi>convict</hi> any man of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of any <hi>his</hi> claime to <hi>my</hi> eſtate, that he cannot ſhew any <hi>deed</hi> whereby it was convey'd to <hi>him</hi> from <hi>me</hi>; And there need no other <hi>Affirmative</hi> proof againſt ſuch an one, then that it was <hi>once</hi> in <hi>me,</hi> and it appeares not how it parted from me to any other. And therefore, till ſome <hi>evidence</hi> be produced, (which I ſuppoſe will never be) that <hi>this power</hi> of <hi>life</hi> is made over from <hi>God</hi> to every <hi>private</hi> man, the demonſtration is abundantly clear, that that <hi>power</hi> is not in any <hi>private</hi> man any more over <hi>himſelfe</hi> then <hi>others.</hi> And it is obſervable to <hi>this</hi> very purpoſe, that though the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> to teach their Diſciples <hi>apathy,</hi> or courage

againſt whatſoever events did talk of that ſure remedy againſt all temporal preſſures, the <hi>going out,</hi> or <hi>killing themſelves,</hi> (looking on it favourably as a <hi>refuge,</hi> or <hi>ſanctuary</hi> from all thoſe things which might otherwiſe be phanſied unſupportable) yet when they conſidered it this other way, (as every thing, they ſaid, had <hi>two handles) i. e.</hi> in reſpect of <hi>God,</hi> who placed them here; it was generally reſolved by them, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Seneca,</hi> and the wiſeſt of them (and the more fooliſh of that Sect, are ſeldome found to <hi>practice</hi> the contrary) that we muſt not on our own heads <hi>deſert</hi> our <hi>ſtation,</hi> but maintaine that ground on which our <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> hath ſet us, and waite with courage and patience, till he think fit to command us off againe. As for the other two, power over the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>freedome,</hi> the <hi>cutting</hi> of one, and <hi>parting</hi> with the other, they are no degrees toward the taking away <hi>life,</hi> but on the contrary are uſed on purpoſe for the preſerving of it, in its being, or well being, the one by the rules of phyſick, the other of policy; and therefore is the power of thoſe allowed us by God, and Nature, becauſe they are thus inſtrumentall to that end, and ſubmitted to our diſcretion, becauſe they may be ſo. Thus are ſome things referred to the <hi>Stewards</hi> judgement, and put into his <hi>power,</hi> to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> for the good of the Family, and yet others <hi>reſerv'd</hi> peculiar, and <hi>ſacred</hi> in the <hi>Maſters</hi> own hands.

            <p n="62">§. 62. The force of this <hi>diſtinction</hi> doth not, I conceive, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>Subject [the people]</hi> (as if that might be taken in two notions, either <hi>ſingly,</hi> or <hi>collectively</hi>) becauſe preſently, without that <hi>diſtinction,</hi> he ſpeakes indifferently of [<hi>A man</hi>] and [<hi>A body of men</hi>] but it belongs to the <hi>Copula,</hi> or word [<hi>Is</hi>] and then it muſt be thus diſſolv'd. <hi>The power of life</hi> may be ſaid to be in a man two wayes, 1. <hi>Formally,</hi> 2. <hi>Eminently</hi> and <hi>Virtually,</hi> and <hi>Radically.</hi> This diſtinction of <hi>Formaliter,</hi> and <hi>eminenter</hi> hath been apply'd by <hi>Philoſophers</hi> to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Bodies:</hi> of which it being by them reſolv'd, that they are <hi>ſimple</hi> and free from thoſe mixtures to which our <hi>ſublunary</hi> bodies are ſubject, and yet it being apparent, that they <hi>warme</hi> and <hi>heat</hi> other things, it is thereupon defined, that they have not heat, or other qualities in them <hi>Formally, (i. e.</hi> in that manner, or kinde, that <hi>fire</hi> is <hi>hot,</hi> or we are <hi>hot</hi>) but <hi>Virtually,</hi> and <hi>eminently, i. e.</hi> that they have ſome other Virtue, or faculty in them, <hi>higher,</hi> or more <hi>eminent</hi> then that heat which is in <hi>inferiour</hi> bodies: and that that doth enable them to warme other things, though they are themſelves ſuch <hi>pure</hi> creatures, as not to have thoſe groſſe qualities in them. Whether this be rightly affirm'd, or onely <hi>nicely conjectured</hi> by <hi>Philoſophers</hi> (for I ſuppoſe there is little known of thoſe diſtant bodies beyond <hi>conjecture</hi>) I ſhall not now enquire, but onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be taught by Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> how this can be made appliable to the matter in hand, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>the power of life and death.</hi> This <hi>power,</hi> we know, is in <hi>God</hi> firſt, and if in any <hi>Eminently,</hi> and <hi>Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> and <hi>Virtually,</hi> certainly in <hi>him:</hi> And in the <hi>Supreame</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate <hi>formally,</hi> being actually inherent in him, though not <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally,</hi> nor in ſo <hi>eminent</hi> a degree as in <hi>God</hi> it is.

have in them ſome <hi>higher,</hi> and more <hi>eminent Virtue,</hi> or faculty then the <hi>power</hi> of every man over his own life; and that that ſupplies the place of that <hi>formall</hi> power, and that by it the <hi>People</hi> beget, or produce the <hi>power of life</hi> in the <hi>Supream Magiſtrate,</hi> as truly, as, if they had it <hi>formally,</hi> they could doe? This is the meaning of the diſtinction in the ordinary, and onely notion of it, and muſt be it, if it be rightly appliable; but Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> interprets his meaning of it, ſo farre from this, ſo farre from importing, or concluding the <hi>People</hi> to have ſuch an <hi>higher</hi> power or faculty (to which [<hi>Eminently</hi>] and [<hi>Virtually</hi>] in oppoſition to [<hi>Formally</hi>] belongs) that 'tis indeed by him ſet downe as much <hi>inferiour</hi> to that power <hi>formally</hi> inherent. For thus he interprets it, <hi>A Man, and a body of Men, have power over their owne lives Radically, and Virtually, in reſpect whereof, they may render themſelves to a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and to Lawes, which, if they violate, they muſt be in hazard of their lives, &amp;c.</hi> By this I diſcerne two things, 1. That by this <hi>eminent, Virtuall, Radicall power,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> underſtands that (which is farre enough from the meaning of thoſe words, and) which Logicians call a <hi>remote,</hi> or <hi>indirect power,</hi> (as that is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to an <hi>immediate,</hi> or <hi>direct</hi>) or rather a <hi>power,</hi> to which this effect is meerly <hi>accidentall,</hi> as if the <hi>patient</hi> were ſaid to have power to cure himſelfe, meaning thereby that he hath power to <hi>ſubmit</hi> himſelf to the <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> who is able to cure him. And for Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to aſſume the liberty of ſpeaking thus largely, was not, I ſuppoſe, his want of knowledge in propriety, but his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to receive advantage from this abuſe of words: And then 2. If this be the onely meaning of the four hard words, <hi>(Eminently, Virtually, Radically,</hi> and <hi>Formally) viz.</hi> that 'tis <hi>in the power of men</hi> (or the <hi>People</hi> in community of nature) <hi>to render themſelves to a Magiſtrate, and to Lawes, to which rendring 'twill be conſequent, that they ſhall hazard their lives upon violating thoſe Lawes,</hi> then, I ſay, are Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> very well agreed; for this his explication of that diſtinction is very reconcileable with thoſe words of the <hi>Addreſſe. This giving up their (i. e.</hi> the peoples) <hi>Liberties to one, or more, makes that man, or men, a Ruler over them, and being a Ruler, to him belongs (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from God, not from them) the power of life which Gods decree hath inſtated in the Supreame Power, or Ruler, who is therefore in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103955:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that relation of avenger for wrath or puniſhment, a Miniſter of God, Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For whence is it that their rendring themſelves to a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> in Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> ſtile, brings upon them that <hi>hazard of lives,</hi> in caſe of violation of <hi>Lawes,</hi> unleſſe it be that he that hath power of their lives, placeth that <hi>power</hi> in that <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> to whom they have rendred, or ſubjected themſelves? That this is <hi>God,</hi> and not the <hi>People,</hi> I will not conclude to be Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi> opinion, becauſe 'tis his maine deſigne to prove the contrary, but that thoſe words of his, and his diſtinction ſo explained will bear that ſenſe, I mean, that they will be true, and acknowledg'd by him, that acknowledges the <hi>power of Life</hi> to be onely in the <hi>Supream Governour,</hi> deriv'd from <hi>God,</hi> I conceive ſufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; &amp; conſequently, that though this power be ſaid to be in the <hi>People remotely, improperly,</hi> and <hi>indirectly,</hi> and ſo in Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> notion of <hi>eminently, &amp;c.</hi> yet 'tis not from the <hi>People,</hi> but from <hi>God</hi> onely, that the Governour hath it.</p>
            <p n="63">§. 63. The reply will be as ready, and eaſie alſo to all force, or concludency of his next Argument, that which is taken from the Peoples power, to make, or <hi>conſent to the making</hi> of <hi>Capitall Lawes.</hi> For 1. Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> cannot be ignorant that it hath been ſometimes in the <hi>power of Kings</hi> to make Lawes, without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any <hi>conſent of the people:</hi> ſuch were the <hi>Principum placitae</hi> among the <hi>Romans:</hi> and after it was thought fit by <hi>Princes</hi> to lay ſome reſtraint on themſelves, both that they might be better adviſed, and more readily obeyed, then, though the <hi>peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> hath been deem'd neceſſary, yet doth this belong onely to the <hi>regulating,</hi> and <hi>modifying</hi> the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of this power: the <hi>Fundamentall power</hi> it ſelfe <hi>of life,</hi> being in the <hi>Supream Governour,</hi> before the <hi>making</hi> theſe <hi>Lawes</hi>; Now 'tis very eaſie to diſtinguiſh betwixt theſe two, the <hi>power,</hi> and the <hi>Regulating</hi> of the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of that <hi>power</hi>; the <hi>power</hi> in the groſſe, and the <hi>determination of that power</hi> to this, or that particular action. The <hi>interpoſition</hi> of man in the latter of theſe, doth no way prejudge the ſole privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>God,</hi> in the donation of the former of them: As the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is his peculiar, and proper gift; and yet man may give <hi>Directions,</hi> and <hi>Rules,</hi> how we are to act by that <hi>Principle,</hi> what uſe it will beſt become us to make of that pretious <hi>talent</hi> entruſted to us.

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:103955:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> induceth from theſe, and the like conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>viz. [That men by nature have ſuch a power over their lives, as voluntarily, &amp;c. to expoſe them to the ſtroke of publique juſtice, in caſe they ſhall offend, &amp;c.]</hi> This being granted, is of no force againſt Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> but doth with him rather ſuppoſe a <hi>Publique Juſtice</hi> able to ſtrike, <hi>i. e.</hi> a <hi>power of life</hi> already veſted in the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> before this <hi>conſent</hi> of the People, or abſtracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without reſpect unto it.

            <p n="64">§. 64. And what if the <hi>King,</hi> as M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> next alledgeth, <hi>have no power to take away the life of his Subjects without cauſe, or for every cauſe, but onely ſuch as by Law are puniſhable with death; what if he cannot command them to be their own Executioners?</hi> Doth it follow from hence, that therefore, he hath the <hi>power of life</hi> from the <hi>People,</hi> not from <hi>God?</hi> Doth the <hi>power of God</hi> ſo conſiſt in doing <hi>cauſeleſſe,</hi> or <hi>irrationall</hi> things, that nothing which is exercis'd <hi>moderately,</hi> or <hi>ordinately,</hi> can be imagin'd to come from him? I ſhall ſuppoſe that <hi>God himſelfe</hi> hath perfect <hi>dominion</hi> over the world; and yet that he obſerves rules of <hi>all-juſtice,</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> in the <hi>exerciſe,</hi> and <hi>diſpenſing</hi> of that <hi>power,</hi> and hath not <hi>power</hi> of doing any thing contrary to thoſe rules of <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Juſtice</hi>; which he hath preſcribed to himſelf; which to do by all wiſe men hath been counted an act of <hi>imbecility,</hi> not of <hi>power.</hi> And conſequently, how naturall is it that he ſhould thus <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and <hi>limit</hi> his deputies alſo? give them <hi>power of life</hi> over their <hi>Subjects,</hi> and yet command them to <hi>exerciſe that power</hi> with that juſt temperament, which either <hi>naturall,</hi> or <hi>civill,</hi> or <hi>municipall Lawes</hi> ſhall dictate, and preſcribe them? And therefore Maſter <hi>Goodwins</hi> arguing is very looſe, and unconcluding; [<hi>That if the power which the King hath over the lives of the poeple, were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God, then he might lawfully execute the ſame, and take away the lives of men, without any mediating direction, or warranty from any Law.</hi>] For ſure the ſame God that gives the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> the <hi>power of life,</hi> doth command him alſo not to throw away that

            </p>
            <p n="65">§. 65. As for that proofe which Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> produceth to enforce his arguing, <hi>viz. [That the execution of no commiſſion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately iſſued by God, ought to be ſuſpended upon, or determin'd, or regulated by any comiſſion, or conſtitution of men.]</hi> It is as far from truth, as it could well have been contriv'd to be: As will appear if it be conſidered; that the word [Commiſſion] 1. ſignifies not an <hi>abſolute,</hi> or <hi>poſitive Command,</hi> but onely a <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of <hi>Authority</hi>; or if a <hi>Command,</hi> yet that 2. onely an <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative precept,</hi> the nature of which is, that it binds not <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> and ſo conſequently, may be <hi>ſuſpended</hi> at ſome time, by the <hi>free will</hi> of him that hath the <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> much more if any weighty <hi>reaſon</hi> interpoſe to <hi>determine</hi> his <hi>will.</hi> 3. That this <hi>Commiſſion</hi> is onely <hi>Generall,</hi> and <hi>indefinite,</hi> without application to particular caſes, referring that <hi>application</hi> to the <hi>conjuncture</hi> and <hi>concurrence</hi> of circumſtances, (which ordinarily are humane, and Politicall;) and conſequently to the <hi>diſcretion</hi> of <hi>Rulers</hi> judging by thoſe <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances:</hi> The intervenience of which circumſtances makes the particular <hi>exerciſe</hi> of that <hi>Commiſſion</hi> convenient, and ſeaſonable in one <hi>place,</hi> and at one <hi>time</hi>; and conſequently, where they do not intervene, there the exerciſe of it may be at that <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place ſuſpended</hi> as unſeaſonable. As when the <hi>ſhedder of blood</hi> is by <hi>God</hi> commanded to be put to death, and yet ſome men accidentally, and invountarily fall under that Title, it muſt be in the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> to <hi>ſuſpend the execution</hi> of that ſentence, or elſe the <hi>Innocent</hi> muſt looſe the benefit of the <hi>Citty of refuge,</hi> and run the ſame fortune with the moſt murtherous deſigner.</p>
            <p n="66">§. 66. After this manner 'tis clear, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from heaven to worke <hi>Miracles,</hi> to cure <hi>Diſeaſes</hi>; yet 'tis parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly affirm'd of the <hi>infidelity</hi> of his Country-men, that that

Or elſe the word [<hi>Furthering</hi>] may be taken to ſignifie no more then <hi>preparing,</hi> or <hi>qualifying</hi> the Subject to a capacity of receiving this <hi>power</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> (as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> prepared mens hearts for the <hi>receiving</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he came, but had nothing to do in the <hi>miſſion</hi> of him, which was the ſole work of <hi>God</hi>) and thus indeed, the <hi>Election of the People</hi> may further the derivation of this power from <hi>God</hi> to ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Ruler; And there is nothing more ordinary then for <hi>Gods</hi> workes to be thus <hi>furthered</hi> by ſecond cauſes, or meanes, even
