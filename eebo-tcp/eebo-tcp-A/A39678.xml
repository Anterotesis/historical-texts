            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>TWO of the greatest, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest,
and most intimate Friends
in the World, <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi>
command me here in their Names,
courteously to salute and invite
you in.</p>
                  <p>They earnestly desire three or
four Hours serious and private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with you about some very
important Personal Concerns of
yours, which cannot admit of deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
or long delay. And if you
make any trifling excuses, they have
commanded and instructed me here
to answer them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:37311:3"/>
In case of absolute and obstinate
refusal to hear them, they order me
to tell you, If you will not talk
with them now, they'll talk with you
shortly whether you will or no. If
you say, you are not now at leisure,
having other business to do; they
both desire you to consider, <hi>First,</hi>
You can have no Business in the
World of equal importance with
theirs. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lawful Affairs you are pursuing,
their Business with you will no way
obstruct, but greatly promote it.
And <hi>Lastly,</hi> That a greater Person
than any of you lost his Life by
pocketing up a Letter at Night,
saying, <hi>To morrow is a new Day;</hi> and
it proved to him indeed <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his last Day, he losing by that
Neglect the only Opportunity of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
longer.</p>
                  <p>If you demand how your Reason
came to be bound up in this little
Book, and say, That which is Reason
<pb facs="tcp:37311:3"/>
to this Author, may be folly and
non-sense to you; I am bid to tell
you, you are obliged first to read and
compare, else your own Reason will
presently call it your own folly and
non-sense so to pronounce. Sound
Reason is uniform, and like it self
all the World over. Its true Laws
and Dictates equally oblige one, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
in like cases and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>If you say, there have been some
Jars and Disgusts betwixt you, and
your Reasons and Consciences; you
and they have fallen out so oft, that
you have no great fancy to come near
them in private, for you expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but harsh and chideing Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
from them, and therefore are
fain by continual Diversions and
quick Successions of Business, to
maintain your Peace, by keeping at
as great a distance from them as you
can.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:37311:4"/>
'Tis their desire you should here
know, <hi>First,</hi> That their debates
with you will be as calm and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as they are seasonable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> That they both
profess (and you may believe them)
they neither do, nor can design any
thing but your good. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That
that Person is certainly in a very
bad Case, that cannot endure to
converse with himself. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
That you herein deny a Civility to
your own Reasons and Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which you daily pay to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Inferiors. And in a
Word, that they desire a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
with you, upon as fair
and honourable terms, as can well
be desired. And that this being
done, they will both stick faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
by you in all the troubles
and dangers of your Lives, and
follow you as your inseparable
Friends, into any thing but Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:37311:4"/>
If you say, This is but a Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
to draw you into a Book, that
will make you melancholy, and
perhaps mad.</p>
                  <p>'Tis their Sense and Judgment,
that of all men living, you have
least reason to pretend the one or
the other in this Case. For they
are very confident you are now in
the most Melancholy circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
men can ordinarily be in on
this side Hell. And for Madness,
they desire to know what you
your selves would call that man,
that is running with such post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haste
to Hell (as will not admit
of two or three hours stop upon
the Road) to prove himself to
be no Mad-man, but in his right
mind and wits?</p>
                  <p>Moreover, they command me to
inform you, It is their desire, that
seeing their debates with you will
neither be tiresome nor impertinent,
you will please to hear them out what
<pb facs="tcp:37311:5"/>
they have to say to you; and then
if you shall find cause to complain
that your Pleas and Excuses are not
fairly drawn, or that you have new
Matter to furnish a better Apology,
they are both content you shall
have your liberty to amend or add
what you please; and if they be not
able to refute them, they'll give you
no further trouble or interruption in
your course.</p>
                  <p>This, Gentlemen, is what I have
in charge to say to you in the <hi>Porch;</hi>
and now if you please, the Door is
open; you may be as private as you
will. They'll attend you to your
Bed-chamber or Closet; and I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
wish an happy issue to this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
debate.</p>

God will either sweep away the filth of
those Nations by the Besom of a general Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or he will sweep away their Inhabitants out
of them with the Besom of Destruction. For if
we have not excussed the Notion and Belief of a
God, and that he animadverts the wickedness of
men (which the very <hi>Heathens</hi> by the Light of

easily be led to this Conclusion, that such over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings

helps them to emerge those difficulties; and I'm

Whereas right Reason designs not the abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all Pleasures, but only the exchange of
them, and that exchange every way to our great
Advantage. The only hurt or loss (if this must
be accounted so) any Man can sustain by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
of Pleasures made by Reason and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is this, that they design for you the rational,
ordinate, and congruous Delights, both of a Man,
and of a Christian, in lieu of the lower, baser, and
filthy Pleasures of a Beast, or a Devil.</p>
                        <p>They propose to you Rules about Pleasures far
more safe and grateful, without any culpable se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
or austerity in them. Reason would only
regulate and <hi>legitimate</hi> your Delights, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<hi>sanctify</hi> them, that you might much more
purely and sweetly enjoy them without either
<hi>shame</hi> arising from their <hi>turpitude,</hi> or <hi>fear</hi> from
their <hi>guilt.</hi> The Rules of both are large and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
enough, and keeping within their lines
and limits, Men shall find such generous, manly,
and agreeable delights, as are no where to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
without them.</p>

                        <p>And <hi>First,</hi> I take it for granted, that no Man's
Reason will deny or demur to this Proposition,
That <hi>Good is to be chosen, and Evil to be avoided.</hi>
For the will is naturally carried to that which is
good, as to its proper Object, and shuns that
which is Evil. And that is naturally good which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37311:21"/>
is convenient, and agreeable to Nature; and that
naturally Evil which is disconvenient and hurtful
to Nature. So that the choice of Good rather
than Evil, is the natural choice of the Will; and
this choice of the Will is founded upon the Law
of Self-preservation, without which the Creation
would quickly disband, and no particular being
could be long preserved.</p>
                        <p>And not only the Will of rational Creatures
chuseth the Good, and refuseth the Evil; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sensitive Creature is endowed with a natural
Faculty to discern the one from the other in order
to the preservation of their beings. You find it
in the smallest and most despicable <hi>Animals,</hi> and
therefore cannot deny it unto Man, the noblest
and most excellent Being on Earth, except only
in his Non-age, before he hath lived to the years
of Discretion. Children indeed in their Infancy
have no knowledg to discern between Good and
Evil, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 39. But Men not discerning Good
from Evil, or chusing Evil rather than Good, are
many degrees beneath Babes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nor will Reason haesitate at all upon
this Particular, That <hi>there are degrees of Goodness
found among Pleasures and Delights;</hi> some are better
than others. Every Life is not alike pleasant and
happy. To deny this, is to make the most despicable
Worm, or Fly, equally happy with the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Creature upon Earth. And beside, for the
Conviction of such debauched Persons, as I am
here arguing with, it will follow clearly from the
denial of that truth, that they really gain nothing
to themselves by all their extravagant and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Courses, there being altogether as much Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Felicity in a temperate, chast, and sober

                        <p>GOD bestowed on Man the Noble Faculty of
Speech (a peculiar Favour and Priviledg)
for two Ends and Uses. (1.) That by the use of
his Tongue he may glorify his Maker, and sound
forth the Praises of his Redeemer. (2.) That we
might thereby be able to communicate our minds
one to another in all our necessary and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Interests and Concernments, whether Civil
or Religious. This Member, the Tongue, tho
small in quantity, is found to be mighty in effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy;
and whilst it is kept under the Rule and
Government of Grace, the words that drop from
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37311:26"/>
it are as Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver.
Gracious words are Bread to feed, and Water to
refresh the Souls of others. A sanctified Tongue
is as a Tree of Life. Conversion, Edification,
and Consolation, are the delicious Fruits of the
Lips.</p>
                        <p>But the Tongues of some Men break loose from
under all the Laws and Rules both of Reason and
Religion, and serve only to vent the froth and
filth which abounds in the heart, as in a Fountain
of Pollution. For <hi>out of the abundance of the heart
the mouth speaketh.</hi> The Tongue moves lightly,
but falls heavily; it strikes soft, but wounds deep.
It would not spare Men of the highest Rank and
Eminence, did not the fear of capital Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
teach them so much Wit to keep their
Tongues in Prison, that they may keep their
Bodies out of Prison. And tho for this reason

Name, left it should grow too cheap and vile, by
the common and needless using of it. The Name
of <hi>Mercurius Trismegistus</hi> was very sparingly used,
because of the great Reverence the People had for
him. The very <hi>Heathens</hi> were afraid to pronounce
the Name of their great god, <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Earth would tremble when his Name was

up his Name vainly and rashly into their
Lips, but audaciously insert it by a profane Oath
into their common Talk, as that which gives
the Grace, Lepor, and Ornament to their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.
Some have not been ashamed to say,

                        <p>The lawful use and end of Swearing, is to put
an end to all Strife, and to maintain both Equity
and Charity among Men, the two Bonds and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments
of Humane Society. Now it being the
Soveraign Right and Property of God alone, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly

to the Truth or Falshood of what they speak; so
that in every such lawful Oath, there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a solemn Appeal, and in that Appeal an Ascrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Glory to his Sovereign Omniscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but therein (implicitely at least) they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under his Wrath and Curse, in case they

Swear falsly, which makes this Action most sacred
and solemn.</p>
                        <p>The deep Corruption of Humane Nature by
the fall, makes these Appeals to God under a Curse
necessary. For it is supposed, tho Men be false
and deceitful, yet there is some Reverence of a
Deity, and fear of his Wrath and Curse, left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extinguished
in their fallen Nature. So that Men
will rather speak the truth, (tho to their own
shame and loss) than by invocating so glorious a
Name in vain, put both Soul and Body under his
Wrath and Curse. By which it appears what an
awful and solemn thing an Oath is; and that
every good Man not only takes a lawful Oath
with holy fear and trembling, because of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of the Action; but rather ought to chuse
Death, than to Swear prophanely, because of the
horrid Malignity of the Action.</p>

                        <p>The contumely and malignity found in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Oaths, appears in that terrible threatning,
<hi>The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his
Name in vain;</hi> a threatning altogether as Just and
Righteous, as it is Severe and Terrible. This Sin
admits of degrees of Guilt. 'Tis highly sinful to
Swear by the Name of God lightly and vainly in
our common Discourses, tho the Oath be clip'd,
and half suppress'd, or disguised in the Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of it, which argues some remains of fear
and shame in the Sinner.</p>
                        <p>'Tis yet worse (and indeed not a jot below
Blasphemy) to swear by any other Name, than
the Name of God. For in so doing, they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37311:27"/>
to a Creature the Sovereign and Incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable

of his Omniscience, to know our Hearts,
and Almighty Power to avenge the wrong upon
us done to himself, as well as to Men by false
swearing.</p>
                        <p>But to break in rudely and blasphemously upon
the Sacred and Tremendous Name of God, with
bold and full-mouth'd Oaths, striking through
his Sacred Name, with direct contumelious
Blasphemies; this argues an heart from which
all fear of God is utterly expelled and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
                        <p>Yet some there are grown up to that prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Blasphemies against that Glorious Majesty which
dwells there. They are not afraid to bid defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to him, and challenge the God that made
them, to do his worst. They deck and adorn (as
they account it) their common Discourses with
bloody Oaths, and horrid Imprecations, not
reckoning them Genteel and Modish without
them. It consists not with the greatness of their
Spirits to be wicked at the common rate. They
are willing to let the World know, that they are
none of those puny, silly Fellows, that are afraid
of invisible Powers, or so much Cowards as to
clip a full-mouth'd Oath, by suppressing, or whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
the Emphatical sounding Syllable; but

They glory that they have fully conquered all
those troublesome Notions of Good and Evil, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

that they can now Affront the Divine Majesty to
his very Face, and not fear the worst he threatens
in his Word against their wickedness.</p>
                        <p>If there be a God (which they scarce believe)
they are resolved audaciously to provoke him to
give them a convincing Evidence of his Being.
And if he be (as they are told he is) rich in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and Forbearance, they are resolved to try
how far his Patience will extend, and what load
of wickedness it is capable to bear.</p>
                        <p>If their Damnation be not yet sure enough,
they will do their utmost to make it sure, by
breaking down the only Bridg whereby they can
escape Damnation; I mean, by trampling under
their feet the precious Blood and Wounds of the
Son of God, and imprecating the Damnation of
Hell upon their own Souls, as if it slumbred too
long, and were too slow-pac'd in its motions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. I am of Opinion, there are few
Christians to be found on Earth, crying so often,

                        </p>
                        <p>Herein they seem to envy the happiness of the
Devils, and damned Wretches in Hell, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
(as one speaks) to snatch Damnation out
of Gods hands before the time, as if they could
not be soon enough among their roaring and

The <hi>Thief</hi> hath a visible Temptation of Gain to

And could I imagine any thing more likely to be
their inducements, than what I shall here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I would not conceal them. There are only
four things that can fall within the compass of my
imagination pleadable by them, when seriously
charged with the evil of the Fact.</p>
                        <p>1. Some of them will haply tell us, that they
would not swear as they do, if they could gain
credit to what they say without it; but the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity
of others provokes them to add so many
Oaths to their single Affirmations.</p>
                        <p>2. Others of them will tell us, they only swear
in their passion, when provoked by injuries recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from others; and if men did not wrong them,
they would not wrong God as they do.</p>
                        <p>3. Some will plead, that Swearing is become
modish, the Badge and Character of a Gentleman,
that it gives them reputation among men of their
own rank and quality, and that they shall be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as sneaking fools, unfit for the Company
of Gentlemen, if they could not discourse with them
in this Dialect.</p>

                           <pb n="41" facs="tcp:37311:30"/>
4. And some will confess the Practice is evil,
but that they have gotten such an ill habit, and
the Sin is become so customary with them, that
many times they know not whether they swear
or no.</p>
                        <p>I cannot imagine, nor (I think) they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
what else is pleadable in excuse or extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this horrid Sin: Let these that are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

to your words without it. Weigh this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the upright balance of thine own Reason,
whether any wise or sober man in the world, will
find himself ever the more obliged to believe what
you say, by the addition of blasphemou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> Oaths
and Imprecations, to your plain and simple Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
and Negations. I cannot think that you
your selves would give the more credit to any
man that shall prosess his sincerity to you, by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in that his very Profession false and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
to his God. Say, Reason, dost not thou
take this for a sure truth, That he who makes no
conscience of being true to God, will never make
much conscience of being false to men? For what
is that which gives any man's words reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
wise and sober men, but the supposition of
his integrity and consciencious fear of his deceit
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37311:31"/>
and guile? Take away that, and with it you take
away the credibility of all his Reports and Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>If I look upon the person that speaks, as a man
of integrity and conscienscious tenderness, I have
a sufficient ordinary security of the truth of what
he saith. But if I look upon him as a man of a
prostitute and seared Conscience, that dares ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon any sin; a man in whom there is no
awe of God to produce veracity in his words;
then my Reason presently concludes, that where
there is no <hi>Truth,</hi> there ought to be no <hi>Trust:</hi> For
<hi>Truth</hi> is the very ground-work and foundation
of <hi>Trust.</hi> Now what truth can we suppose to be
left in that man, that sticks not upon any trivial
occasion to break asunder all the obligations of a
Creature to his Creator; together with all the
bonds of kindness his great and best Benefactor
hath bound him withall, and without any the least
Injury he can pretend his God hath done him, to
fly in his very face with the most contumelious
Language? Can we suppose any truth to be
in, or any trust to be due to such a man as
this?</p>

<hi>Eccl. 9. 2. Him that sweareth, and he that feareth
an oath.</hi> A conscientious man is so afraid of an
Oath, that he would rather chuse to die than
swear some kind of Oaths: And though he be
satisfied of the lawfulness of an Oath in general,
and of the matter of that Oath he sweareth in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
yet an holy awe and fear of God fills his
heart, when he swears lawfully and necessarily,
leſt he should sail in the manner of it, by not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that due reverence to the Name of God,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37311:31"/>
which so sacred and solemn an Action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
                        <p>But from prophane swearing and blaspheming

God is not in that man's heart: And where there
is no fear of God, what truth can be supposed in
him, or what trust can be due to his Words or
Oaths? but the more he swears, still the less rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
all wise men have to believe him. And I am
sure the credulity of Fools adds little reputation to
him. This Plea therefore for prophane Swearing,

Whether there be any weight in this Apology
for Swearing, will quickly appear, now it is to
be laid in the ballance of true Reason.</p>
                        <p>1. And first of all, let us consider what makes
a true Gentleman, and whether prophane Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
have any place in his true
Character and Description. A
Gentleman is one that springs
from famous and renowned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
and degenerates not from
their Probity and Honour.<note n="†" place="margin">Generosus, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis, ex praecla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro genere ortus, qui à genere non de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Plebeans are wont to do. Upon this account the
Poet rightly observes,
<q>
                              <l>Quo major est quisquis, magis est placabilis ira,</l>

Men of <hi>Genteel</hi> Extraction and Education, are
Persons whose Passions are supposed to move more
<hi>gently</hi> than other mens: And if at any time they
be moved disorderly, yet are they more placable,

2. Though I am most willing to pay a becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deference to all Persons of Noble and Genteel
Extraction, yet in faithfulness to their true honour,
I am here obliged to say, (and in saying it, I can
offend no man that hath a true sense of honour)
that their natural Descent can never give them so
much honour, as the Vices I am here censuring
will reflect ignominy and dishonour upon them.
To be a slave of Satan, and your own lusts, is such a
mark of infamy, as all the honourable and illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Titles in the world can never cover. It is
better to rise by Vertue to Honour, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Parents, than by Vice and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to grow contemptible from honourable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
'Tis your honour to have many Servants at
your command, obsequiously attending a nod of
your head, or a beck of your finger: but ask your
own Reason, Gentlemen, whether it be not a
greater dishonour for you to attend as obsequious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
your selves upon every beck and nod of Satan,
and your own lusts.</p>
                        <p>Were your <hi>Natural Birth</hi> once ennobled by the
<hi>New-Birth,</hi> you would be more than thrice ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable:
Grace would make you more illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
than your natural Extraction doth or can do.
Or if Morality (which is far inferior to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and for which, <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves have
been renowned in the <hi>Pagan</hi> world) did but adorn
and beautifie your Conversations, though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
entitle you to Heaven, or secure to you the
glory of the world to come, yet it would make
you shine in the eyes of men in this World, and
taking its advantage from your honourable Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
make you differ from persons of an inferior
rank, as Stars of a greater magnitude and lustre.</p>

                        <p>6. In a word, I am past all doubt, and so may
you too, that this genteel mode of Swearing,
Drinking and Whoreing, which hath spread so
far in the present infamous Age, into Protestant
States and Kingdoms, is the very Spirit and strength
of a <hi>Popish</hi> Plot, Subtilly projected, and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
managed for their effectual reduction to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For nothing in the world can reconcile men to
<hi>Popery,</hi> yea, and even endear them to it, like
Debauchery. Under <hi>Popery, Gentlemen</hi> may come
up to the rates of costly Pardons and Indulgences,
for their greatest Sins. They may give themselves
liberty to wallow in prophaneness all the days of
their life. They may give their lusts the utmost
scope and liberty, and yet have a plenary Pardon
when they die. So that they need not abridge
themselves of any sinful liberty, or boggle at the
loudest Blasphemy, whilst they have that in their
Pocket to still and quiet something that grumbles
in their Bosom. Do you not see, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the
narural tendencies of these things? Does not
Debauchery look like a Shooing-Horn to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides, Gentlemen, the Devil and the Pope are
confederates in a farther design upon you; and if
their design hit, they hope to win by Power what
they may miss by Policy; and that by the very
same method of corrupting and debauching Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

Kingdoms and Commonwealths. For (as a

                        <p>If Gentlemen therefore by this means be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
corrupted and infected by Debauchery, their
influence and example is likely to infect the
greatest part of the Body-Politick, and either
make the people easily pliable to the charms and
courtships of <hi>Popery,</hi> for the Reason before
mentioned, or so besot their excellent Parts, and
enervate their Mafculine Courage, that they shall
fall an easie prey to their (otherwise) weak and
despicable Enemies.</p>
                        <p>And certainly, Gentlemen, we have all cause
to reckon this Plot very far advanced, when we
shall see Debauchery every where made the Badge
of Gentility; and Chastity, Temperance and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
become the marks and notes of Infamy.
When Civility it self shall be hiss'd with derision
out of some Gentlemens Company; and the more
temperate and sober any man is, by so much the
less fit to be a Gentleman's Companion.</p>

                           <pb n="53" facs="tcp:37311:36"/>
By this time I hope you are convinced, that true
Gentility is no enemy to Sobriety, nor Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Character of Gentility; and will at least
pardon, if not thank me, for endeavouring this
way to secure the true honour of some, whilst I
rationally argue down the Vices and Follies of
others. This Plea for Debauchery, you see hath
the same fate the former had, and deserves never
to be mentioned more.</p>

                        <p>There is but one Plea more, and that as
silly and irrational as any of the former; And
that is,</p>
                        <p>The custom and habit of Swearing, which you say is
hard to be broken. This Sin is become so customary to
you, that now you scarce note or observe it in your
selves.</p>
                        <p>That there may be Truth in the Matter of this
Plea, I neither deny nor doubt; but that it is a
rational and allowable Plea, will never be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by your own Reason. The thing you say
may be true; for we sometimes find that when
you are taxed for Swearing, you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
swear that you did not swear; and
curse him to his face, that accuses you for
Cursing.</p>
                        <p>But pray, Gentlemen, make your own Reason
judge, whether Custom be a valid and allowed
Plea for prophane Swearing and Cursing. Say,
Reason, wilt thou allow that one of the highest
aggravations of Sin, is pleadable in thy Court
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37311:37"/>
for the excuse or extenuation of it? Wilt thou
give it under thy hand, that the man is the less
guilty, because the more wicked? Darest thou to
warrant it, that God will take the less notice of
the wrongs men do him, because they are used
and accustomed so to wrong and abuse him every
hour in the day? If your Reason can allow and
warrant this, I must say it is different, yea, and
opposite to the common Reason of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                        <p>Say not, I make my own Reason the Rule and
Standard of yours or other mens. For I argue
here (as I have done all along before) upon the
common <hi>Topicks</hi> and <hi>Maxims</hi> of Reason, generally
allowed all the World over by Mankind. If a
Practice be evil, the oftner it is repeated, the more
still it is aggravated.</p>
                        <p>To be plain and faithful with you, Gentlemen,
if it be your custom to blaspheme, 'tis God's cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
to damn Blasphemers. If you use to be
drunk and unclean, God uses to punish Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and Adulterers (if impenitent and unrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
with his everlasting wrath.</p>
                        <p>And when you are cited (as shortly you must
be) before the awful Tribunal of the great, the
just, and the terrible God, ask but your selves,
whether such a Plea as this, be like to excuse you
in whole or in part, and take off the heinousness
of these horrid Impieties? Will your prophane
Oaths, and direful Execrations and Imprecations,
be excused in the least degree, by telling him,
Lord, I was so accustomed to blaspheme thy Name,
Cursing, Swearing and Damning were so familiar
Language in my Lips from day to day, that I had
quite lost the sense of the Action, as well as of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37311:37"/>
the evil thereof; and therefore, Lord, pity, spare
and have mercy on me: O damn not my soul to
thine everlasting wrath. For though I have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated
it upon my self, yet frequent custom at
length extinguished all my sense and conscience of
the evil thereof, till at length I could play with
a direful imprecation as an harmless thing; nay,
thought it an ornament and grace to my Speech,
a gallant Expression alamode the Times and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
I lived in.</p>
                        <p>Is not this as good a Plea, and not a jot better
than that of a Malefactor upon his Tryal for Life
and Death, when Theft or Robbery have been
evidently and substantially proved upon him, and
the Judge demandeth what he hath to say for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
why Sentence of Death should not pass
upon him? Mercy, my Lord, Mercy, cries he;
for I have been so used and accustomed to filching
and thieving from my Youth up, that for some
years before I was apprehended, every ones Goods
and Cattel seemed to me to look like my own;
so that I scarce knew when I stole, and when I
did not.</p>
                        <p>And thus, Gentlemen, you have heard a fair
Tryal of the Sin of prophane Swearing and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations
of Damnation, and you have heard
the verdict of your own Reason and Conscience
upon the Case. The Lord help you to break off
and reform that sin, for which there is not one
word of Apology or excuse now left in your
Mouths.</p>
                        <p>Let me close all I have to say upon this head
with one plain Question: Do you think you must
die, or live here for ever, as you now do? If you
are convinced (as all the Living are supposed to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37311:38"/>
be) that you must die, do you desire an easie and
comfortable, or a painful and terrible Death? I
presume there is no man living that is convinced
he must die, but desires naturally and rationally an
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, as easy and comfortable a dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as may be. If so, I appeal to your Reason, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prophane swearing and blaspheming the
Name of God, be a proper rational way to obtain
peace and comfort at death? With what hope or
encouragement can those tongues of yours cry at
death, Lord have mercy upon me, which have
prophaned that Name, and imprecated Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from him, till you came into your last extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
which convinced you, you could live no
longer.</p>
                        <p>'Tis a serious Question, and well worth a cool
and solemn debate in your own Reasons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.
Some of you are more immediately
exposed to the dangers of death than others, ready
to be disbanded by a <hi>Bullet.</hi> If you fall, you must
either fall considerately, or inconsiderately. If
inconsiderately, and without any sense or consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of this horrid guilt, you die impenitently,
and consequently desperately and miserably. If
considerately, and with awakened Consciences, I
demand, Whether such guilt as this will not roar
louder than the Peals and Vollies of those great
and small Guns do, which breathe Destruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, and round about you? I have done my
Message plainly and faithfully to the very face of
your Reason and Conscience; and if for my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and zeal both for God's honour and yours,
I am rewarded with your C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

different Natures and Originals, yet they do
clasp and embrace each other with most dear and
tender affection. 'Tis marvellous to behold such
a Spiritual and Heavenly Creature as the Soul in
all men, fervently loving, and in most men fondly
doting upon a lump of Clay, a clod of Earth: It
sympathizeth tenderly with it. If the meanest
Member of the Body be in pain, the Soul is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
concerned for it, and evidences it self to
be so, by commanding the eyes both to watch
and weep; the Tongue to complain and moan;
the Hands to bind up its Wounds with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
tenderness, and carefully defend it from the
least injurious touch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Memory and Invention, awaken and

bestir themselves to the uttermost for its delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and safety.</p>
                        <p>Whilst the Soul lives in union with the Body,
'tis filled with assiduous (and too often with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
and distracting) cares for its necessary
support and comfort. And when it must be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from it by death, what strong aversations
to death doth it ordinarily discover? The strong
tyes and bonds betwixt it and the Body, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be loosed without much conflict and strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

sends forth; groans which other men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

                        </p>
                        <p>The reason of all which, lies in the intimate
relation which is betwixt these different Natures,
which God hath married together in the Womb,
from which time they have been companions
and partners in all the comforts and troubles of
life. The Body is the Soul's house in which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dwells, and still shall dwell, till death dissolve it.
'Tis the Soul's Garment, that clothes and covers it.
It hath worn this Garment of Flesh from the
beginning, and is to wear it still, till Sickness
hath brought it to Rags, and Death stript it from
the Soul.</p>
                        <p>'Tis the Tool and Instrument by which it doth
all its Works, whilst it is in this state of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;

fervently. No man ever yet hated his own Flesh,
but nourisheth and cherisheth it.</p>

                        <p>The case so standing betwixt the Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
the wisdom or folly of the Soul is plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in its way and manner of governing the
Body, as the love and prudence of an Husband
is in the government of his Wife; Or the Master
in ordering the Affairs of his House; or the neat
breeding of a Man in the comely wearing of his
Garments; Or the skill and care of an Artificer
in the brightness, keenness, and sharpness of his
Tools.</p>
                        <p>Some Husbands give evidence to the world
of their governing-prudence and ability, in such
an allowance of liberty to their Wives, as the
Laws of Conjugal Love require, and their Estates
and Incomes will conveniently bear, and no more;
and in restraining their Extravagances, as well
as by encouraging their vertuous Courses, in
keeping back no due encouragement to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
nor giving the least encouragement unto
Vice.</p>
                        <p>A well-bred man, that carries with him a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming-sense
of his Quality, and the <hi>Decorum</hi>
he ought accordingly to observe, will wear his
Garments decently, and becoming his Rank:
They shall be sure to be neat and clean, and sit
fit and comely upon his Body. He abhors to
wear a Garment tumbled in the Mire, and
go like a Beast, without regard to his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>No prudent Owner and Governour of an
House, will let the Rain drop through the Roof,
nor choak up the Passage to his Door with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37311:40"/>
Dung-hill. His House within shall be neat, and
not nasty: The Rooms clean and comely: And
yet abhors to suffer superfluous Ornaments, and
costly Vanities to swallow up his Estate that
should maintain it, and bring Bailiffs (more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than a Dunghill) to his very Doors.</p>
                        <p>The curious Artificer neither grinds away the
substance of his Instruments to make them bright
and glittering, and set an Edge too fine to hold
one minutes use; nor yet suffers them to be
thrown aside in some neglected corner, where
Rust and Flaws shall render them utterly useless, or
make him blush at the botches such Instruments
will cause in his Work.</p>
                        <p>The prudent <hi>Husbandman</hi> will neither break the
heart of his Ground for want of rest and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post,
nor yet over-load it with dressing, which
brings forth nothing but rank and useless Weeds;
He will in a fit season turn in a stream of Water
to his Meadows, like a Cordial-draught to faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
spirits; but will not drown it, and rot the
very roots of his Grass, by letting in too much,
or by suffering it to lie under Water too long.
He will feed his Horse high enough to perform
his Journey, and carry him through the Mire;
but will not feed him to such an heighth, that the
Rider shall neither be able to sit, nor command
him.</p>
                        <p>In all these cases, the common prudence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man, directs him to that just mediocrity,
wherein both his Honour and Profit do appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
lie. And what we say in such common
cases and concerns as these, is as true, and much
more excellent in the Soul's prudent government
of its own Body, unto which it was espoused in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37311:40"/>
the Womb, and is its dear and constant Partner,
both in present and future Good or Evil. 'Tis

the Body those necessary Supports and Comforts
which God and Nature allow it, nor yet surfeit
and overcharge it with more than it is able to

Kindness to it. We account it one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
outward Infelicities in this World, incident to
a discreet and virtuous Woman, to be headed and
governed by a sottish Fool, neither able to govern
himself, or her, nor give a reason of his own
Actions or Commands. A Man whose folly shall
make her blush in all sober Companies he comes
into, and forces her upon such a Course of Life,
as she perfectly abhors, and will bring speedy
Ruin upon her; all Men pity such a Case as this.
And this is the very Case of many a comely, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
Body.</p>
                        <p>Only such a Woman hath two reliefs under
her Bondage, which the Body of a Drunkard

wants. She can sometimes withdraw and retire
from his Company, and enjoy the relief of her
Solitude, which the wretched Body of a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
cannot do till Death, but is tied day and
night to the Company of its foolish Soul, which
is frequently abusing it, and imposing upon it.</p>
                        <p>Besides, such a Woman may haply over-live
her vicious, abusive Husband, and spend many a
comfortable year in the World with a more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
sober, and religious Partner of her Life,
whose Sobriety, Discretion, Piety, and Love
shall make full Compensation for all those years
of Misery and Slavery she endured before. But
the Case before us, admits no such Relief: For as
long as ever the Body lives and breathes, the
Soul is, and must be with it, and in it. And

their more sober and prudent Government of
their Bodies. They give their Bodies the true
Pleasure of the Creature, by keeping them to
that happy Mediocrity in which it consists.
They devote their Bodies to the Service of God;
thou hast devoted me to the immediate Service
of the Devil. A Majestick Beauty sits upon
their Faces; Sottishness and Folly upon mine.
Their Knees are daily bowed in Prayer to
God; mine shake and tremble in the Service

Pleasures of a Beast. Their Bodies will be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

King, or Persons of Quality and Honour.</p>
                        <p>6. And lastly, some will tell us, They have

bring <hi>Cain</hi>'s Curse upon your vigorous Bodies, and
make you go shaking and trembling (as he did)
about the World.</p>
                           <p>2. Let it be demanded of your own Reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Whether it do really judg that God bestowed
more Strength and Vigour upon your Bodies, than
he hath upon others, to Arm a stronger Enemy
than others are, to fight more vigorously against
him, than others do, or can do? Or whether it
were not designed by him for greater Use and
Service to his Glory in the World, than other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

of his People (how willing soever they be) can
do for want of that strength you have? I am
confident no Man of sound Intellectuals will
dare to assert the former, or deny the latter.</p>
                           <p>3. And lastly, for your glorying in Drinking
down, and conquering others, you will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put your own reason to a blush, by offering
such a Plea as this to it. You are not yet arrived
to Impudence enough to deny Drunkenness to
be a Sin, and your Reason is yet sound enough,
easily and naturally to infer, That by how much
the more any Man exceeds and goes beyond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in Sin, by so much the greater Sinner that
Man is.</p>

And as for the Honour and Glory you talk of
in exceeding others in your Abilities to drink,
your Reason will quickly make you ashamed of
that Glory; and prove, as well as assert it to be a
Mark of basest Infamy.</p>

                              <p>Whether the addition of far greater troubles,
or causes of troubles to the inner man, be a
proper expedient to alleviate and ease the
loads and burdens of your outward troubles,
already grown almost too heavy for you to
bear.</p>
                              <p>I dare venture all that I am worth, upon sound
Reason's side, that it will never allow or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
such an absurdity, as the affirmative
part of this Question draws along with it.</p>
                              <p>Believe it, Sirs, all the outward necessities,
cares and fears, which now oppress you upon the
score of worldly affairs (which frame not to your

light and easy, to the Stings, Wounds, and
Lashes of a guilty Conscience: But when all these
inward Troubles shall be superadded to your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Troubles, they will in conjunction make a

                              <p>What ever Cares or Troubles Providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves
any good Man in, in the honest and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
pursuit of his civil Calling, he may in a great
measure relieve his burthened Spirit under them,
by the comfortabel Testimony of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and his free Addresses to God in Prayer.
These will sweetly support him under his othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

can men that exercise Reason expect? And let
the first Question be this;</p>
                           <div n="1" type="question">
                              <head>Quest. I.</head>
                              <p>Whether the Pleasures of Temperance do not
far excel those of Intemperance? If they do, then
this your Plea is vain and irrational. For you
foolishly choose a lesser Pleasure, and refuse a
greater and sweeter one. And that you do so
in this case, no wise man can deny or
doubt.</p>
                              <p>For temperate drinking refreshes the Body, and
no way burthens it, as excessive drinking doth.
And that which burthens Nature can never be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
pleasant with that, which yields nothing but
due refreshment. Temperance doth not vitiate, but
raiseth the pure and ordinate Appetite of Nature
to its just pitch and height; in which temper, and
at which height, it is most capable of the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
pleasure from the Creature. As the Strings of
a <hi>Lute</hi> give us the sweetest and most delicious Notes
when they are not let down too low, but are all
sixed at their due height.</p>
                              <p>Temperance gives us the most pleasing Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the good things of this Life, still lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Mind free and fit for the more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and sweet Enjoyments of a better and more
excellent Life; which Excess never did, nor
can do.</p>
                              <p>Moreover, Temperance maintains the manly
grace and majesty of the Countenance, but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
totally disguises it. It draws the lines of
Drunkards faces into a form much like those ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
<hi>Dutch Pictures,</hi> which some set upon their
Chimney-pieces, to move laughter in those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them.</p>

Now by the vote of universal Reason, that

                                 </gap>eshes the Body, but no way
burthens it, which raises the ordinate and unviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
Appetite of Nature to its just pitch and due
height, which gives Nature the sweetest refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
leaving it always fitter and freer for high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and better pleasures, which maintains the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grace and majesty of the Countenance, and
makes not a wise man look like a Fool or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,

                           <p>You say you would not haunt Taverns and
Ale-Houses as you do, but that you are drawn in

                              <head>Quest. 1.</head>
                              <p>Why must the importunity of Good Fellows
(as you call them) be an irresistible Temptation
to you, and deprive you of all power to deny
them, whilst you discern the Snares and Mischiefs
they draw you into? This seems to be a thing
unaccountable to Reason. Suppose you were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to spend the longest Summers Day in the
highest gratifications of all your Senses together,
or successively one after another, upon condition
that you would endure the Torments of the Rack
till that day twelvemonth came about again; do
you think the importunity of all your intimates
in the world would prevail with you to accept
the Pleasures of a day under such a condition as
this? And yet what are the Torments of a year
upon the Rack, to the Torments of Hell for
ever and ever? Or to come lower; suppose
one of those lewd Companions, not worth a Groat
if every man had his own, should request you to
lend him an Hundred Pound upon his own secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37311:48"/>
could you find no power (think you) to
deny him, especially if the loss of that Hundred
Pound would certainly ruin you? If you would
deny him (as I doubt not but in such a case you
would) tell me then, why you should not find
power to deny him when he asks a far greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than an Hundred Pound, even the Peace, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Safety of your Souls, as well as the
Health of your Bodies, and Honour of your
Names? Why then should you be so easy and
flexible when they ask the latter, and so stiff and
unperswadable to the former?</p>

and this draws you into the Snares of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
I will not deny but men may lawfully
transact their Business in such Places, and there
may be a conveniency, and sometimes a necessity
for it: But that's not the Case. The Question
referred to the determination of your Reason, is
this, <hi>Why Drunkenness must accompany Business?</hi> and
whether a man be not more fit to transact his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and drive Bargains of the greatest value,
whilst his Body and Mind are cool, sober and

Children by Drunken-Bargains!</p>
                              <p>Besides, I must tell you, that in all such Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

Your Reasons and Consciences can never tell you,
you can make up as comfortable an account with

that few Women were like her. He answered,
yea, were she not my Wife I could love her.
Had she been his Whore, he could have loved
her; he thought none like her; but because she
was his Wife, hedged in by God, he cared not
for her. Oh! what hearts have Men, that they

3. The Health of the Body is secured by chast
and regular Enjoyments; but exposed to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
the other way. God hath plagued the Inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinacy
of mens Lusts with most strange and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Diseases. That <hi>Morbus Gallicus, Sudor Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
and <hi>Plica Polonica</hi> were Judgments sent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by God's own hand, as the Witnesses of
his high displeasure, against the bold and daring
contemners of his sacred and awful Command.
Thus as <hi>Prov. 5. 11. They mourn at last, when their
flesh and body are consumed.</hi> Other sins are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Body, but this against it, as well as
in it.</p>
                        <p>4. The blast and waste of our Estates (which
is the usual consequent of uncleanness) is preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and avoided, by keeping within God's Rules.
The truth of what the Scripture tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi>
10. 5. is often exemplified before our eyes; that
<hi>by reason of a whorish woman, a man is brought to
a morsel of bread.</hi> Adultery gives a man Rags for
his Livery; it lodges his Substance in the House of
Strangers, and entails wants and curses on him
and his.</p>
                        <p>5. In a word, Continence or lawful Marriage
exposes not the Soul to the eternal wrath of God,
as Uncleanness doth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. This sin
does not only shut a man out of his own House,
and the Hearts of good men, but out of Heaven
it self, without thorow Repentance and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                        <p>The case standing thus, 'tis matter of just Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
how the Sin of Uncleanness should grow
so Epidemical and Common, as it doth, seeing
such as live in this filthy Course, must needs
counteract and oppose their own Reason
and Interest together. For they forsake God's
way, which gives them as much liberty as can be
reasonably desired, and cast themselves into a
course of Life, clog'd with all manner of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
and eternal Miseries of Soul and Body, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Estate.</p>
                        <p>The plain Rule and Dictate of common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which I laid down before, being applied to
this particular Case, manifestly condemns it. For
seeing Honesty and Chastity comprizes the true
Pleasure, Profit, and Honour of the whole Man,
is more congruous to humane Nature, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative
of it, it ought therefore to be preferred
in the Estimation and Choice of all Men to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
adulterous Pleasures, which (for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
above) are inferior in themselves to chast,
conjugal Enjoyments; and besides that, are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and followed with such a Train of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and future Miseries, destructive to the whole
Man.</p>
                        <p>And yet for all this, to the amazement of all
serious Observers, never was any Age more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
for this Sin, than the present Age is, and
that under the clear shining Light of the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>What the special Causes and Inducements to
the overflowing and abounding of this Sin, are in
the present Age, will be well worth the enquiring

                           <p>But if there be no Partiality, or Respect of
Persons with God (as most assuredly there is none)
then both greater and lesser, honourable and

to the same common and intolerable Misery.</p>

                        <p>It is Folly in its highest exaltation, for one

other, not only to seek all ways and means to
suppress and ruin it, whilst a common Danger
hangs over the whole; but to rejoyce in the
Miseries of their Brethren, as the principal
thing which they fancy would contribute to the
great Advantage of their Cause. What but a

                        <p>The Histories of those times sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us, That the great Feuds and Factions in

rational Apologies or Methods of Peace

To be sure, none but their own.</p>
                        <p>The more cool, prudent, and moderate Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

allay these unnatural Feuds and Animosities.
The Wisdom of the governing-part may take the
Instruments of Cruelty out of their hand; but 'tis
God alone that can pluck up the roots of Enmity
out of their hearts.</p>
                        <p>And what is the matter, when all is sifted and
examined? Why, the matter is this; some will
be more serious, strict, and conscientious, than
others think fit or necessary for them to be. They

as others do. They scruple to comply with what
God hath not commanded, and the very Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
confess to be indifferent antecedently to their
Command. They reverently mention the Name
of God without an Oath, and the solemn Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, without a Jest in their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
They will assume as much Liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
Sin, as others do to commit it. They
take more pleasure in heavenly Duties and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Conferences, than in Ranting and Roaring in
Taverns and Alehouses. That is, in a word,
they live up to the Principles of Religion, which
all pretend to; and this is their unpardonable
Crime, a fault never to be expiated by any less
punishment than their destruction.</p>
                        <p>And are not People (think you) come to a
fine pass, when the strictest Obedience to the
Laws of God shall be accounted more criminal,
than the most open and profane Violation of
them? Nay, tho they reprove the other Parties
Sins no other way, but by their more serious and
religious Lives; yet this alone shall be sufficient
to make them culpable and obnoxious.</p>

Judgments. And what can heighten and accent
the Sins of a People more than such a cruel

the Contrariety and Repugnancy of the Natures

the way, is an abomination to the wicked,</hi> Prov. 29. 27.
Only with this difference; The good Man hates,
<hi>Non virum, sed vitium,</hi> not the Person, but his
Sin. The wicked Man hates both the Person of
the Godly, and his Godliness too; yea, the Person
for his Godliness sake.</p>
                        <p>This hatred of the Godly, secretly and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually

                        <p>You that thus Censure, and those that are cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured

live Soberly and Godly. They attend upon all
the Duties of Religion strictly and conscientious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Your Malice against them can find nothing
to carp at, but some little Trifles, with which the
Essence of Religion is not concerned. Did they run
into the same excess of riot with you, greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
than these would be over-looked, yea, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
too.</p>
                        <p>Now let Reason and Conscience say, who is
most likely to be the Hypocrite, the Man that
calls himself a Christian, and under that Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
wallows in all profaneness, not once censuring
himself for it; or he that lives Soberly and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
against whom Malice it self can produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but such inconsiderable Trifles as these?
Is not this the very Case which Christ hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to our hands, and made such Censurers
the Hypocrites, <hi>Matth. 7. 3. And why beholdest
thou the mote that is in thy Brothers eye, but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest
not the beam that is in thine own eye?</hi> It was
but one blemish, and that a very small one too,
but a <hi>Mote;</hi> however this you can quickly spy,
and as rashly censure. But mean while there's a

by you. Which of these two (think you)
is the Hypocrite?</p>
                        <p>2. But what if this <hi>Mote</hi> that you discern, be
but a fancy, a meer imagination of your own,
how will that aggravate your Sin, and evince
both your Malice and Hypocrisy together? You
say their Tones and Gestures in Religious Duties
are Ridiculous and Scenical. This you take up
lightly against some few of them, and as unjustly
apply unto the aspersing of the whole Party,
which your own Reason must and will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
condemn. For there are multitudes of that
Party, whose Countenances, Tones, and Gestures,
are as decorous, grave, and becoming the presence
of that God with whom they they have to do, as
any Men in the World.</p>
                        <p>3. And as for those few whom you thus ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
for their indecent Tones or Gestures; what
if those Tones you speak of, amount to no more,
but natural Defects, and unavoidable Infirmities,
which they would, but cannot help? Do they
for this, and no worse than this, deserve to be
censured and condemned for Hypocrites? Or,
what if they be insensible Actions, occasioned by
the greater Intention of their Spirits in the Service
of God? May not those very things which you

to cover your own Malice against Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
how comes it to pass that more Scenical
Habits, Words, and Gestures, should pass as
Ornaments in others, whom you affect? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be not partiality unworthy of a Man,
let Reason and Conscience freely judge.</p>
                        <p>In a word, What Commission or Authority,

and then persecute them as far as you

Zeal for the Laws, and Security of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
if rightly tempered and qualified, is
highly commendable; and wherever Sincerity
animates, and Prudence governs it, it ought by
no means to be discouraged. But there are too
many Grounds and Causes of Suspition, that both
these will be found wholly wanting, or extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defective in many high Pretenders to it,
when it comes to be sifted to its bottom Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and weighed in the just Ballance of sound
Reason.</p>
                           <p>For if you be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Laws you live under, since your Zeal burn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>
so hot against those that comply not punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with them. For those that make so much
Conscience (as you seem to do) of other Mens
Offences against the Laws, must be presumed
(if your Profession be sincere) to make at least
as much Conscience of breaking any of them
in your own Persons; else neither Reason nor
Conscience will ever admit this Plea of yours for
sound and good.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="108" facs="tcp:37311:64"/>
Now the Laws sometimes appoint Punishments
for Non-conformity to the Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
affixed to the publick National Worship;
and so they do always for convicted Swearing,
Drunkenness, and Adultery. All these Laws
have the very same Sanction by the Authority
we live under. They forbid, and punish the one
as well as the other. And if there be any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
it lies in this, that these latter are expresly
forbidden and threatned by God, antecedently to
the Magistrate's Prohibition of them, which hath
no small weight in the matter under consideration.</p>
                              <p>Now if any Man shall pretend Zeal and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
against dissent in Judgment or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
from the Church, but makes no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
at all to Curse and Swear, be Drunk
or Unclean; he will find it a difficult task to
perswade his own, or other mens Reasons or
Consciences, that this his Zeal for the Laws and
Government, is sincere and pure. For were it so,
it could never allow him to live in the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Violation of the Laws himself, which he is
so fierce and bitter against others for</p>

                                 <hi>Secondly,</hi> If your Zeal be sincere, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it self within the Bounds and Limits of the
Offence, and not lay hold upon the Innocent,
as well as upon the Guilty, and make you hate
and persecute them that were never Turbulent
and Seditious, equally with the greatest Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.
If you will hug this Principle, as things
stand now, Reason will tell you, 'tis as just at all
other times, as it is at this.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="109" facs="tcp:37311:64"/>
Would you not think it an unreasonable and
most injurious thing to be plucked out of your
Shops, or Houses, and hurried away to the
Goal, because two or three dissolute Fellows
in the City or Town where you live, have
been Riotous or Seditious, tho you possibly
know not the Men, nor can be so much as
justly suspected of any Confederacy with them?
True Zeal for the Laws and Government is
content to wait, and suspend its Revenges, till
a fair Conviction have passed upon the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And when it falls upon them, 'tis care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that it touch none besides them; but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
a Man to retain in the very height of it,
due Love and Honour for all that are Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                              <p>If Christians be first denominated by general
Titles and Terms of distinction, which they
cannot help, and then the Crimes of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Person, that the World pleases to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
as one of the same Party, must be charged
and imputed to the whole; what must the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of this be, but that the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
become obnoxious to Punishment, and
the very Government it self thereupon be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved?</p>
                              <p>For I take it to be past denial or doubt, that
some of each Denomination have been, are, or
may be guilty of seditious Practices. Some
Hypocrites will lurk among those vast Bodies
of People under the most strict and watchful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
but God forbid their guilt should
affect the whole Body, under whose Name they
shelter themselves. God, Reason, and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
do all command the hottest Zeal to make
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37311:65"/>
its Pause and just Distinction here. Let the
Guilty be brought to Condign Punishment
upon fair Tryal and Conviction. This Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
designs no Favour for such. But let not
those who abhor their Wickedness, and are
as pure from their Crimes as your selves, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with them, or for them. For then your
Reason will tell you, your selves are as liable
to sufferings as they, and that your Zeal is not
kindled by love to Justice, but the hatred of a
Party.</p>
                              <p>It is not in the Body Politick, as in the Body
Natural. If the hand Steal, the feet are justly
laid in Irons, and the Neck put into an Halter;
because all the Members of the Body Natural are
animated and governed but by one Soul. But
in the Body Politick every Individual hath a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Soul of his own, and therefore that Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
only that offends, ought to be punished,
and all the rest to enjoy their full Liberty and
Honour as before. Away therefore for ever
with this Church and State-destroying <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche.</hi>

protect that Party and Practice which once they
made Criminal; then your Reason, and every

that your Countenance and Carriage

to the different aspect of the Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37311:65"/>
upon them: That your Envy and
Hatred cease with the offence, and that you be
as ready to assist and encourage them, when they
act according to Law, as you formerly were to
afflict and prosecute them for acting contrary
to Law; else, pretend what you will, 'tis plain
enough, that it was not Zeal for the Laws and
Government, but somewhat else (which every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
may guess at) that inflamed your Rage against
them.</p>
                              <p>For whensoever the Wisdom of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
finds it necessary by Toleration to take
away the Crime and Offence, it must necessarily
take away this very Plea for Hatred and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
with it. Otherwise it would be all one
to act for Law, and against Law; to punish them
that are Offenders, and them that offend no more
than your selves; to turn the Edg of your Rage
and Fury against those that undermine the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and those that are as Zealous as your
selves to support and defend it by their Persons
and Purses.</p>

                                 <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Your Reason will justly expect it
from you, that when or wheresoever you shall
see eminent Piety meeting with punctual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in one Man, that Man shall be your
very Darling, and that both these Qualifications
should recommend him to your dearest Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
The more strictly godly he is, the more
conformable he is to the Laws of God; as well
as by his punctual Compliance with enjoyned
Rules and Rites of Worship to the Laws of

Men. If he be a Man of Catholick Charity
to all of every Perswasion, whom he judges
to fear God, and be truly conscientious; if he
boldly and impartially reprove Sin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he finds it, tho it be in his own Patron,
or Men of his own Profession; you will still
love him the more for that. For if Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

very things which you make such a Noise
and Bussle for in the World, here you have
them both in conjunction. This is the Man
you seem to seek (by these Pleas of yours)

                              <p>And is it really so, Gentlemen, with you?
Do you heartily affect and prize a strict and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Conformist, that fears not to expose the
odious Shamefulness and Wickedness of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Swearing, Cursing, Drunkenness, and
Uncleanness, without respect of Persons, both in
his Pulpit and private Converses? Do you love
him the better for his plain dealing with your
Consciences, in detecting the grand Cheat of
Formality in Religion; for his close cutting
Convictions of the insufficiency of meer Civility
to your Salvation, and the indispensable neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity

your Love must not be confined to your

been in the World, all this Fining, Imprisoning,
and Impoverishing your Protestant Brethren and
Neighbours for their Conscience-sake, hath done
the Church no good, but given a great and real
Advantage to our common Enemy to ruin us
together; that we may distinguish our selves

were in it self sufficient to cool a wise Mans

and Reason of the State shall plainly discern
both the Usefulness and Necessity of Liberty,
and thereupon take away (as they have now
most prudently and seasonably done) the further
occasions of mischief to the whole, by relaxing
the Yoke that bound some (and those a very
great Body of truly Loyal and Useful Subjects)
leaving the rest in the quiet Possession of their
own Liberties and Properties; what shall we call
that Fire, which still continues burning and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
not only after, but by all this, but an
unquenchable Hell-fire?</p>

And now, Gentlemen, I hope I may say,
without being vain or opinionative, that your
own Reason hath fairly disarmed you of
these Pleas and Excuses, by which you have
hitherto defended your selves in your most
sinful Practices of profane <hi>Cursing,</hi> and <hi>Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
Drunkenness, Uncleanness,</hi> and bitter <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
against your Protestant Brethren for
things that touch not the Essence of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                              <p>And believe it, Sirs, it is truly Genteel and
Glorious, to suffer your selves to be subdued and
conquered by the plain Convictions of your
own Reason and Conscience. 'Tis ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times more Honourable and Glorious to lay
down your Arms at the feet of these, than to
lay down both Reason and Conscience at the
feet of Satan and your Lusts, and continue sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obstinately against God, your own Souls,
Bodies, Estates, Reputations; yea, your very
Reasons and Consciences, your Innocent Brethren,
and the Peace of Church and State, under Satan's
Banner.</p>
                              <p>In all this Discourse, I have not designed
to exasperate, but asswage and restrain your
Lusts and Passions, by laying the loving and
gentle hands of your own Reasons and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
upon them. I have not given the least In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
touch to your Honour, but all along
pleaded for the Recovery, or Security of it. I
have exposed no Man by any particular Mark or
Indigitation.</p>
                              <p>But now I have don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Consciences shall begin to make a rounder and
more particular Application of these general
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:37311:68"/>
Reasonings and Arguments, and say to you, as
<hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David, Thou art the Man,</hi> I am not
accountable for that. But be confident of it,
you are accountable to God for all those plain
Convictions and faithful Endeavours used with
you, and tryed upon you, to save you from all
those Miseries your head-strong Lusts with furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Precipitation are manifestly running you
into.</p>
                              <p>If you can substantially and solidly refel those
Arguments against, and vindicate those Pleas
for Sin, which Reason and Conscience have ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and censured above; and can produce stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and clearer Arguments to defend and justify
the Courses here censured and condemned: Or
if you can obtain a Writ of Error to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
these Causes to another lawful Court of
Judicature, where you shall obtain a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Verdict, your complaint of severe Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with you here, will not want some Ground
or Colour: But if you cannot (as you know you
cannot) then never blame your own Reasons,
nor mine, for dealing Rigorously or Injuriously
with you.</p>
                              <p>I am willing to hope, and perswade my self,
that I shall at least obtain a Reformation of Life
from many of you. I have tugg'd hard for it
with you here. I will tug harder with God in
Prayer to obtain it for you. But yet, Gentlemen,
I must tell you in the close, That tho an external
Reformation of these Evil Courses may make
your Lives more healthy, happy, and durable
in this World, and will greatly conduce to the
publick, as well as your personal and private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;
yet if you expect compleat and perfect
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37311:68"/>
Happiness in the World to come, you must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
one step further beyond Reformation, unto
sound <hi>Conversion.</hi> The first makes you <hi>compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi>
happy here; but the second will make you
<hi>perfectly</hi> happy and blessed for ever hereafter.
The first frees you from many <hi>temporal</hi> Miseries
upon Earth; but the second from <hi>eternal</hi> Miseries
in Hell. And this brings you to the other
blessed Step, by Conversion, which is the Second
Part.</p>

their own Consciences, both of the extream wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
and the immediate danger of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Course they have heitherto pursued, and
persisted in. And that by this time they begin to
interrogate them in the Apostle's close and cutting
Language, <hi>Rom. 6. 21. What fruit had ye then in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:37311:71"/>
those things, whereof ye are now ashamed? For the
end of those things is death.</hi> 'Tis hard to imagine,
that so many close Debates and Reasonings as
you have heard in the former Part, should not
leave many of you under conviction and trouble
of Spirit. You see your own Reasons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
have condemned you; <hi>And if our heart
condemn us</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>God is greater than
our heart, and knoweth all things,</hi> 1 John 3. 20.
'Tis folly to imagine, you shall be acquitted at
God's immediate Bar, who are already cast
and condemned at your own Privy Sessions.</p>
                     <p>If this be the happy effect (as I hope it is) of
all the former close and solemn Debates with
your Consciences, it will naturally and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
cast thy Soul, Reader, into great admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of, an astonishment at the patience and long-suffering
of God, that hath born with thee, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a life of prodigious and reiterated provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
until this day. And his Goodness will be as
admirable to thee, as his Patience; in that he hath
not only suffered thee to live till this day, but
made it the day of thy Conviction, the first neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
step towards thy Conversion: and the very
first things he entertains thy convinced and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Soul with, to be the possibility and probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of thy Conversion to God.</p>
                     <p>The greatness of his Patience shews his Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Power, <hi>Rom. 9. 22. Nahum</hi> 1. 3. But his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to pass by all the wrongs you have done him,
and to be at peace with you, discovers the immense
riches of his grace, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3, 4.</p>
                     <p>That God should be so quick in the executions
of his wrath upon your Companions in sin, and
so patient and long-suffering towards you, that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:37311:71"/>
have out-sinned them all, is such a comparative
consideration of his bounty, as should even over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
the man that beholds it, <hi>Rom. 11. 22. Behold
the goodness and severity of God! on them that fell, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity;

course of thy Life, hast been a prophane Swearer,
a beastly Drunkard, a lascivious person, an hater
and persecutor of good men; and after all this,
the Lord hath brought an offer of mercy to thy
Soul, and shall convince thee it is not come too
late, but that the Door of Hope stands yet open to
thee; my advice to thee is, That thou cast thy
self down at the feet of mercy, and after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

<hi>Impulsive Cause</hi> of Remission. That infinite <hi>Abyss</hi>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:37311:73"/>
such mountains of guilt as thine have been.</p>
                     <p>2. Nor do thy sins exceed the power and ability
of the <hi>Meritorious Cause</hi> of Remission, namely, <hi>the
Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> for that Blood is the
Blood of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. He is the Lamb of
God, whose blood is sufficient to take away the
sins of the world, <hi>John</hi> 1. 29. There is but one
sin in the world exempt from Remission by this
blood; and if thy heart be now wounded with
the sense of sin (as I here suppose it to be) that's
none of thy sin, how heinous soever thy other
sins be.</p>
                     <p>3. Nor do thy sins exceed the ability and power

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:37311:74"/>
Consider <hi>Isa. 55. 7, 8. Let the wicked forsake
his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and
let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy
upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:
for my thoughts are not your thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. Here
you have the nature of Conversion described <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively</hi>
and <hi>Positively,</hi> by forsaking your ways
and thoughts, and turning to the Lord, The <hi>way</hi>
notes the external course of the Conversation;
the <hi>thoughts</hi> denote the internal frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Mind; both these must be forsaken.
And <hi>turning to the Lord,</hi> denotes the sincere dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole man to God; all which is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and easy for the Spirit of God to do; and
this being once done, abundant Pardon is assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
If you say you cannot think it; God tells
you in the very next words, That his thoughts are
not your thoughts, but as far above them as the
Heavens are higher than the Earth. Read to the
same purpose, <hi>Isaiah 1. 18, Rev. 3. 20. John</hi> 7.
37.</p>
                     <p>III. And to make the possibility of Remission
yet clearer, know for your encouragement, that
as vile, infamous, and prodigious Sinners as your
selves, are recorded and found amongst the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and examples of forgiven sinners in Scripture.
<hi>Paul</hi> was once a fierce and cruel Persecutor and
Blasphemer, yet he obtained mercy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13,
14. That sinful <hi>Woman</hi> recorded <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 37, 38,
was an infamous and a notorious sinner, yet her
sins, which were many, were forgiven her, <hi>v.</hi> 47.
<hi>Manasseh</hi> was a Monster of wickedness, as you
may read, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. yet found mercy. And
if you view that Catalogue of sinners given in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:37311:74"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. you will seem to find among
them the very forlorn-hope of desperate sinners,
advanced nearest to Hell of any men upon Earth;
yet see <hi>ver.</hi> 11. what is said of some of them: <hi>And
such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are
justified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All these things plainly shew (I say not the
<hi>Certainty</hi> that you <hi>shall</hi> be, but) the <hi>Possibility</hi>
that you <hi>may</hi> be pardoned; which is a mercy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
unspeakable.</p>

think of returning by Repentance and Conversion,
so late in the day as this is.</p>
                     <p>To obviate this deadly snare of Satan, I shall
here further add, That there is not only a <hi>Possibility</hi>
of your recovery, but in some respect a stronger
<hi>Possibility,</hi> that such as you may be converted and
saved, than there is for those that have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

instead of the imputed righteousness of
Christ.</p>
                     <p>This plainly appears by that convictive Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Christ to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees, Mat.</hi> 21.
31. <hi>Verily I say unto you, That the Publicans and
Harlots go into the Kingdom of Heaven before you.
Publicans,</hi> the most infamous among men, and

wrought over to Christ by Faith and Repentance,
than the more civil and self-righteous <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Pharisees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed 'tis far easier to come at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of such sinners by Conviction, than at the
others. They have nothing to ward off the
stroke of conviction: It must fall directly and
immediately upon their Consciences. The most
smooth and civil part of the world trust to their
own righteousness, and this self-confidence, like
<hi>Armour of proof,</hi> resists all attempts to bring them
to Christ for righteousness. Nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in a state of evil more, than a strong conceit that
their Condition is good.</p>
                     <p>But such as you are, whose whole lives have
been polluted with prophaneness and all impiety,
your Consciences will more easily receive convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of your present danger, and of the necessity
of a speedy and thorow change. You cannot think
as others do, that you need no Repentance or
Reformation. In this respect, therefore, you lie
nearer the Door of Hope and Mercy, than other
Sinners do.</p>
                     <p>If therefore it shall please the Lord (whose
grace is rich and free to the vilest of sinners) to
pluck out such as you, as brands out of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

not only become real Christians (as all true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
are) but the most excellent, useful and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

the most eminent Instruments for his Glory. As
you have gone beyond other sinners in wickedness,

                     <p>BUT here I must warn you of some common,
but most dangerous Mistakes committed in
the world with respect to Conversion unto God.
Except these be seasonably prevented or removed,
none of you will ever stir or move further than
you are towards Christ. Amongst others, beware
especially of these three following fatal Mistakes.
That of
<list>
                           <item>1. Baptismal Regeneration.</item>
                           <item>2. Common Profession of Christianity.</item>
                           <item>3. Formality in Religious Duties.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. There is a notion spread among men, and
almost every where obtaining, That the Scriptures
mean nothing else by <hi>Conversion,</hi> but <hi>to be baptized
in our infancy into the visible Church;</hi> and that this
Ordinance having past upon them long ago, they
are sufficiently converted already; and that men
make but a needless stir and bussle in the world
about any other or further Conversion.</p>
                     <p>But, Sirs, I beseech you consider how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a thing it is to take your own Shadow for
a Bridge, and venturing upon it drown your
selves. If Baptism be Conversion enough, why
doth Christ say, <hi>Mark 16. 16. H<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> that believeth
and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth
not, shall be damned?</hi> Baptism without Faith signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
nothing to Salvation; but Faith without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:37311:76"/>
(where it cannot be had) secures Salvation.
And why doth the Apostle say, <hi>Gal. 6. 15. Neither
Circumcision nor Uncircumcision availeth any thing, but
a new Creature?</hi> Or what needed Christ to have
pressed and inculcated the indispensible necessity
of Regeneration upon <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> as he doth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.
3, 5, 7. who had been many years a circumcised
<hi>Jew?</hi> This your dangerous dependance upon
your Baptismal Regeneration, is what hath given
such deep offence and prejudice to many (though
without just cause) against that Ordinance. I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it as much as they, that men should turn it
into such a deadly snare to their own Souls, yet
will still honour Christ's abused Ordinance.</p>
                     <p>2. Some think the common profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
makes them Christians enough. They are
no <hi>Heathens, Mahometans,</hi> or idolatrous <hi>Papists,</hi> but
<hi>Protestants,</hi> within the Pale of the True Church,
that is, professed reformed Christians.</p>
                     <p>But Friends, I beg you to consider, that convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
Text, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 20. The Kingdom of God is not
in word, but in power.</hi> Many there be, that in
<hi>words</hi> confess Christ, but in <hi>works</hi> they deny him.
And why were the foolish <hi>Virgins</hi> (that is, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
reformed Christians) shut out of the Kingdom
of God, if the Lamps of verbal profession, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Oyl of Internal Godliness, were enough
for our Salvation? <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 3, 12. Believe it, Sirs,
many will claim acquaintance with Christ upon
this account, and expect favour from him in the
great day, of whom he will profess he never
knew them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. Christ need not have put
men upon striving as in an Agony to enter in at
the strait Gate, if Baptism in our Infancy, or
Verbal Profession of Christianity were all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:37311:77"/>
men had to encounter in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Formality in external Duties of Religion,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
fatal mistake of Conversion. Have not
these been the inward thoughts of your hearts;
As bad as we are, though we take liberty to swear,
be drunk, and unclean sometimes; yet we say
our Prayers, keep our Church, and hope for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Salvation, as well as those that are more
precise?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But tell me,</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>seriously, What do you
say or plead for your selves more in all this,
than those convicted Hypocrites did,</hi> Isa. 58. 2.
Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as
a Nation that did Righteousness, and forsook not the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of their God: They ask of me the Ordinances
of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.
<hi>Or to come nearer yet to your Case, and cut off
at one stroke for ever this vain Plea of yours,
read and ponder God's own Censure of it, in</hi>
Jer. 7. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Behold, ye trust in lying
words, that cannot profit: Will ye steal, murder, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Adultery, and swear falsly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and come and

                     <p>IF the Lord shall in his rich grace and mercy to
your Souls stir up in them the thoughts and
resolutions of a change of your course, great care
ought to be taken in the time of this change, lest
they miscarry in their remove from one State to
another. Multitudes miscarry betwixt a State of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:37311:78"/>
Prophaneness, and true Godliness. To continue
in the State of Prophaneness, is to be certainly lost;
and so it is to take up short of Christ in meer Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
and Formality in Religion. This middle
state takes up multitudes by the way, who do
but change the open Road for a more private way
to Hell.</p>
                     <p>Meer Civilized Nature is Unregenerated Nature
still. <hi>They return, but not to the most high; they are
like a deceitful Bow,</hi> saith the <hi>Prophet, Hos.</hi> 7. 16.
They seem to aim at Christ and Salvation; but
as an Arrow from a weak Bow, it goes not home;
or as from a deceitful Bow, it slents aside, and
misses the Mark. 'Tis true, they are not openly
prophane, as they were before; but they take up,
and settle in an Unregenerate State still. Their
<hi>Condition</hi> is the same, tho their <hi>Company</hi> be not.</p>
                     <p>This is excellently set forth by our Saviour,
<hi>Matt.</hi> 12. 43, 44, 45. The Devil may be cast out
as a <hi>prophane</hi> Devil, and yet keep his propriety still
as a <hi>formal</hi> Devil. The sense of that Text is well
expressed by one in this Note upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
by Formality keeps the Devil's Propriety,
and disposes the Soul to final Apostacy. You are
as far from Christ and Salvation under the power

                     <head>Of the absolute Necessity of a thorow Change.</head>
                     <p>WHatever the Difficulties and Hazards be
that attend this Change by Conversion
unto God, the Change it self is absolutely and
indispensibly necessary to every man's Salvation.
The Door of Salvation can never be opened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Key of Regeneration. Christ assures Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and Formal <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that except he be born
again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.
3. Think not Conversion to be the attainment of
some singular and extraordinary Christians; for
'tis the very point upon which every man's eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Happiness or Misery depends. There is one
Law for all the world, They must be changed or
damned. No Restitutions or Reformations, no
common Gifts or Abilities, no Religious Duties
or Services, can save any man from Hell without
a Change by thorough Conversion, <hi>Rom. 8. 8. They
that are in the flesh, cannot please God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Satisfie and please not your selves with this;
Though we live in sin, yet God is a merciful God;
we will confess our sins to him, say our Prayers,
keep our Church, and no doubt, but God will
be merciful to us, as well as others. Consider it,
man, that this <hi>merciful God</hi> is also a <hi>God of Truth,</hi>
and this God of Truth hath plainly assured thee,
That all these external things signifie nothing to
thy Salvation, unless thou become a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15. And that thou must be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>John</hi> 3. 3. Say not without this, you will
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:37311:79"/>
hope in God. If you hope in God, you must
hope in his Word, <hi>Psalm</hi> 119. 81. Now where
will you find that Word in the Bible, that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
the hope of Salvation in an unregenerate
person? All Scriptural hope is of a purifying na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and evermore productive of an holy life,
1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3.</p>
                     <p>If you say, Christ died for the greatest of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and you trust to be saved through him: 'tis
true he did so; but Conversion is his only method
of Salvation, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. And those that are not
washed by Sanctification, have no part in him, or
in his Blood, <hi>John</hi> 13. 8. He came not to save men
continuing in their sins, but to save his people
from their sins, <hi>Matt.</hi> 1. 21. His way is to lead
you through Sanctification unto Salvation, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi>
2. 13. If you have a mind to see whom and now
he saves, you have it before your eyes, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14.
<hi>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from
all iniquity, and purifie unto himself a peculiar people,
zealous of good works.</hi> Those only are saved by
him, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,
live not only <hi>soberly</hi> and <hi>righteously,</hi> but <hi>godly</hi> in this present world.</p>
                     <p>And this is the Change I am here pressing you
to: and until this change be made, you cannot
find your selves within the compass of any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Promise,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. But if you will turn to
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. You may the very next minute find
your selves barr'd out of Heaven by a Scripture-threatning.
Let no man therefore impose so
great a cheat upon his own Soul, as once to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that any thing short of sound Conversion,
can ever put him out of the danger of Damnation.</p>

will, stop when nature is duely refreshed: Your
wicked Companions can provoke, but not force
you. You can, if you please, shun Lascivious Books
and Company, and keep your Bodies chast, at
least from the External Acts of Uncleanness.</p>
                     <p>And why cannot you (if you please) perform,
as well as neglect, the external Acts of Religious
Duties? The same feet that carry you to a Tavern,
can carry you to your Closets, if you please to
have them do so. Nor do I know any reason why
you cannot compose your selves, when engaged
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:37311:80"/>
in God's publick or private Worship, to a close
and serious attendance to those Duties. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the mind to what is spoken, is of
great concernment to you: And if an unsanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Minister can apply his thoughts to compose a
Sermon and preach it, I see no reason why an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
Hearer may not also compose and apply
his mind to hear it. And I am past all doubt, that
something may be done beyond all this. You
have some power certainly to reflect upon, and
consider what concernment you have in the things
you read or hear, and how they agree or disagree
with your experience.</p>
                     <p>Now if men would but do this (which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they have a power to do) though they cannot
convert themselves, yet hereby they would lie in
the hopeful way of Converting Grace; which is
more than they could ever yet be perswaded to
do. And though there be no positive certainty
or assurance that Conversion and Salvation shall
follow these Acts; yet hope and probability are
engagements enough. Hope sets all the World
on work without Assurance. The <hi>Plough-man</hi>
ploughs in hope, and the <hi>Merchant</hi> ventures in
hope. Do but as much for your Souls, as these
do for their Bodies.</p>

                     <p>BUT here I expect to be encountered by all
the policy and power of Hell. Satan and
your own Lusts are in confederacy to turn away
your minds from such Counsels and Perswasions
as these. They will tell you, this is no proper
season to mind your Conversion: 'tis either too
soon, or too late. You have not yet had pleasure
enough in sin, or so much as hath put you beyond
all hope of mercy: That Religion is a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
thing, and if once you look that way, you'l
never have a merry day or hour more, With a
thousand such damps and discouragements.</p>
                     <p>But pray, Gentlemen, do so much at least for
your Souls before you turn away your ear from
the instructions of life, as to hear these matters
examined. If they be not worth that, they are
worth nothing.</p>
                     <p>I will suppose you in the flower and vigour of
your Youth, and this dangerous season now nick'd
with a more dangerous Temptation, that it is too
soon to mind such serious Matters now: You
have not yet had your full pleasure out of sin.</p>
                     <p>Need I to spend a word to refute and baffle such
a Temptation as this? I doubt not but you your
selves can easily do it. Ask your selves, Sirs, if
sentence of Death were pass'd upon you by Men
(as it is by God, <hi>John 3. 18. He that believeth not
is condemned already</hi>) would you think a Pardon
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:37311:81"/>
could come too soon? Be assured every bit of
Bread you eat, is the Bread of the Condemned.
You are in hazard of Hell every day and hour:
There wants nothing but a Sword, a Bullet, a
Shipwrack, or Disease (of which Multitudes wait
on you every day) to put you beyond mercy, and
all hopes of mercy. And can you get too soon
(think you) out of this danger and misery? Oh,
why do you linger any longer? The danger is
too great and imminent to admit one hours longer
delay.</p>
                     <p>And it is as strange and strong a delusion on the
other side, to fancy it is now too late. The vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and groundlesness of this hath been evinced in
the <hi>Second Section,</hi> to which I refer you for full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                     <p>And for the loss of your Pleasures by Conversion
to God, that's the thinnest and silliest Pretence of
all the rest. That's the same thing as to imagine
it is to a Thirsty Man's loss, to leave the puddle-waters
of a broken Cistern, to enjoy the Cristal
Streams of a flowing Fountain: For the Pleasures
of an Ale-house, Play-house or Whore-house, to
be sweeter than the light of God's Countenance,

of Glory with him in Heaven, of which you read,

now no more Charms of Pleasure, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Companions to divert of stupifie them) what
a case will you then find your selves in! What
a cold sweat will then lie upon your panting bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms!
What a pale horror will appear in your
countenances? Will you not then wish, Oh that
the time I have spent in vanity, had been spent
in the Duties of serious Piety! Oh that I had
been as careful of my Soul as I was of my
Body! What are the pains of Mortification,
which I was so afraid of, to the pains of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which I begin to scent and apprehend!
I thought it hard to pray, mourn, and deny my
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:37311:84"/>
self, but I shall find it harder to grapple
with the Wrath of an incensed God to all
Eternity.</p>

the Process and awful solemnity of the

<hi>Heb. 9. 27. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 10. Suppose you saw all

even Multitudes, Multitudes, which no man
can number; all these separated into two
grand Divisions; Christ the Supream and final
Judge upon the Judgment-Seat, the Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and Unregenerate World quivering at the

the Executioners standing ready to take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
will you not then (think you) be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

this your supine and sottish carelesness? A

Trumpet, sounds a loud Alarm to all Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
Negligent and Trifling Sinners; and this
is the Voice, if you will not be in the same
case with the miserable condemned World. Put
to it heartily then in the use of all means with
God and Men, for converting and regenerating
Grace <hi>now,</hi> which is the only thing that differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
your state from those miserable Wretches

Paleness and horror, fear and trembling upon
the outward and inward man, whilst God is
making the immediate impressions of his wrath
upon the Conscience; seeming to want some one
to let out that miserable wretched Soul, that is
weary to stay any longer in the Body, and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to be dislodged, lest its Condition be made
worse by the exchange; do you think you would
ever imprecate Damnation any more? and yet all
these terrors and horrors upon the Conscience are
but as the sweating of <hi>Marble</hi>-Stones before the

                        <p>But what if God should give you a Vision of
Hell it self, and of the inconceivable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible
misery of those desperate and forlorn
Wretches, that lie there sweltring and groaning
under the heavy pressures of the wrath of a great
and terrible God, immediately and everlastingly
transacted upon their Souls? would you ever jest
with Damnation any more, as with an harmless
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:37311:85"/>
thing? Nay, would you not strive to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to flee from this wrath to come? Do you
not seem to hear in this rational and just Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
a doleful Cry coming from Hell, and the
state of the Damned, with this very Sound and
Sense; Good Souls, if ever you expect to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from this state and place of Torments,
strive to the utmost, strive while you have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
strive whilst breath and strength
do last, to flee from, and escape by sound
Conversion this doleful state of Eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Vision of Heaven, as <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had in the

from that which governs such as you;
blessing the Lord that enabled them to be praying
and praising, whilst others were cursing and
swearing; to be sighing and groaning for sin in
secret, whilst others were shouting and singing
in Taverns and Ale-houses; to beat down their
Bodies, and keep them under, whilst others were
pleasing and gratifying their Lusts; would you
still drive that course you do? Well, Sirs, if ever
you expect to come where these blessed ones are,
you must take the course they did. Let this be
your endeavour, and it shall be my fervent and
hearty Prayer.</p>
