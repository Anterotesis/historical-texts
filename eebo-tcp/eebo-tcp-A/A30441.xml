            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>ECCLES. II. 26.</bibl>
               <q>For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight,
wisdom, knowledge, and joy.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHEN the Author of this Book, the
Wisest of Men, <hi>applied his heart to
know and to search, to seek out wisdom,
and the reason</hi> (or nature) <hi>of things;</hi>
and summed up the Account of all,
Article by Article, <hi>one by one,</hi> to
find out the thread of Nature, and
the Plann of its great Author; <hi>tho his Soul sought
after it,</hi> yet the Riddle was too dark, he, even he,
could not discover it: <hi>But one man among a thousand
he did find,</hi> and happy was he in that discovery, if
among all the Thousands that he knew, he found
One counting Figure for so many Cyphers, which tho
they encreased the Number, yet did not swell up the
Account, but were so many Nothings, or less and
worse than Nothings, according to his estimate of
Men and Things.<note place="margin">Chap.7.25, 27.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We have reason rather to think, that by <hi>a Thousand</hi>
is to be meant a vast and indefinite number; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it must be confessed that <hi>Solomon's</hi> Age was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65710:3"/>
a Golden one, if it produced <hi>one Man, to a
Thousand</hi> that carry only the name and figure, but
that do not answer the end and excellency of their
being. The different Degrees and Ranks of Men,
with relation to their inward powers and excellencies,
is a surprizing but melancholy Observation: Many
seem to have only a Mechanical Life, as if there were
a moving and speaking Spring within them, equally
void both of Reason and Goodness. The whole race
of men is for so many years of Life, little better than
encreasing Puppits; many are Children to their Lives
end: The Soul does for a large portion of Life, sink
wholly into the Body in that shadow of death, Sleep,
that consumes so much of our time; the several dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of the Body, the Blood and the Spirits, do so far
subdue and master the Mind, as to make it think, act,
and speak according to the different ferments that
are in the humours of the Body; and when these
cease to play, the Soul is able to hold its tenure no
longer: all these are strange and amazing specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions!
and force one to cry out, Why did such a
perfect Being make such feeble and imperfect Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
<hi>Wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</hi> The
Secret is yet more astonishing, when the froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the pride and ill-nature, the ignorance, folly
and fury that hang upon this poor flattered Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
are likewise brought into the Account. He
that by all his observation, and <hi>encrease of knowledge,</hi>
only <hi>encreaseth sorrow, while he sees that what is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cannot be numbred, and that which is crooked, cannot
be made straight,</hi> is tempted to go about, and with
<hi>Solomon,</hi> to <hi>make his heart to despair of all the labour
wherein he has travelled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65710:3"/>But as there is a dark side of Humane Nature, so
there is likewise a bright one, The flights and compass
of awakened Souls is no less amazing. The vast croud
of Figures that lie in a very narrow corner of the Brain,
which a good memory, and a lively imagination, can
fetch out in great order, and with much beauty: The
strange reaches of the Mind in abstracted Speculations,
and the amazing progress that is made from some
simple Truths into Theories, that are the admiration
as well as the entertainment of the thinking part of
mankind; The sagacity of apprehending and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
even at the greatest distance; The elevation
that is given to Sense, and the Sensible powers, by
the invention of Instruments; and which is above
all, the strength that a few thoughts do spread into
the mind, by which it is made capable of doing
or suffering the hardest things; the Life which they
give, and the Calm which they bring, are all so
unaccountable, that take all together, a Man is a
strange huddle, of Light and Darkness, of Good
and Evil, and of Wisdom and Folly. The same
Man, not to mention the difference that the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Ages of Life make upon him, feels himself in
some minutes so different from what he is in the other
parts of his Life, that as the one fly away with him
into the transports of joy; so the other do no less
sink him into the depressions of sorrow: He scarce
knows himself in the one, by what he was in the
other: Upon all which, when one considers a Man
both within and without, he concludes that he is
both <hi>wonderfully,</hi> and also <hi>fearfully made:</hi> That in
one side of him he is but a little lower than Angels;
and in another, a little, a very little higher than Beasts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65710:4"/>But how astonishing soever this Speculation
of the medly and contrariety in our composition
may be, it contributes to raise our esteem the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
of such persons as seem to have arisen above,
(if not all, yet) all the eminent frailties of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature; that have used their Bodies only as
Engines and Instruments to their Minds, without
any other care about them, but to keep them in
good case, fit for the uses they put them to; that
have brought their souls to a purity which can
scarce appear credible to those who do not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that to be possible to another, which is so
far out of their own reach; and whose Lives have
shined in a course of many years, with no more
allay nor mixture, than what just served to shew
that they were of the same humane nature with
others; who have lived in a constant contempt of
Wealth, Pleasure, or the Greatness of this World;
whose minds have been in as constant a pursuit
of Knowledge, in all the several ways in which they
could trace it; who have added new Regions of
their own discoveries, and that in a vast variety
to all that they had found made before them;
who have directed all their enquiries into Nature
to the Honour of its great Maker: And have
joyned two things, that how much soever they
may seem related, yet have been sound so seldom
together, that the World has been tempted to
think them inconsistent; A constant looking into
Nature, and a yet more constant study of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and a Directing and improving of the
one by the other; and who to a depth of Knowledg
which often makes men morose, and to a heighth of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65710:4"/>
Piety, which too often makes them severe, have add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the softness of Humanity, and all the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Charity, an obliging Civility, as well as a
melting kindness: when all these do meet in the same
person, and that in eminent degrees, we may justly
pretend that we have also made <hi>Solomon's</hi> observation
of <hi>one man;</hi> but alas! the Age is not so fruitful of such,
that we can add <hi>one among a thousand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To such a man the Characters given in the words
of my Text, do truly agree, That <hi>God giveth to him
that is good in his sight, Wisdom, Knowledg, and Joy:</hi>
The <hi>Text</hi> that is here before us, does so agree to <hi>this</hi>
that I have read, that the Application will be so easie,
that it will be almost needless, after I have a little
opened it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A man that is good in the sight of God,</hi> is a Character
of great extent: Goodness is the probity and purity
of the mind, shewing it self in a course of sedate
Tranquility, of a contented state of Life, and of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Generous Actions. A good man is one that
considers what are the best Principles of his Nature,
and the highest powers of his Soul; and what are
the greatest and the best things that they are capable
of; and that likewise observes what are the disorders
and depressions, the inward diseases and miseries,
which tend really to lesson and to corrupt him; and
that therefore intends to be the purest, the wisest, and
the noblest Creature that his nature can carry him to
be; that renders himself as clean and innocent, as free
from designs and passions, as much above appetite
and pleasure, and all that sinks the Soul deeper into
the body; that is as tender and compassionate, as gentle
and good natured as he can possibly make himself to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65710:5"/>
be. This is the <hi>good man</hi> in my Text; that rises as
much as he can above his body, and above this world,
above his senses, and the impressions that sensible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
make upon him; that thinks the greatest and best
thing he can do, is to awaken and improve the seeds
and capacities to Vertue and Knowledge, that are in
his nature; to raise those to the Noblest objects,
to put them into the rightest method, and to keep them
ever in tune and temper: and that with relation to
the rest of Mankind, considers himself as a Citizen
of the whole world, and as a piece of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
that enters into the concerns of as many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as come within his Sphere, without the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowness
or partiality of meaner regards; that thinks
he ought to extend his care and kindness as far as
his capacity can go; that stretches the Instances of
this, to the utmost corners of the earth, if occasion
is given for it; and that intends to make mankind
the better, the wiser, and the happier for him in
the succeeding as well as in the present Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>This is the truly <hi>Good man</hi> in <hi>God's sight,</hi> who does
not act a part, or put on a Mask; who is not for
some time in a constraint, till the design is compast
for which he put himself under that force; but is
truly and uniformly good, and is really a better man
in secret, than even he appears to be; since all his
designs and projects are worthy and great: And
<hi>Nature, Accidents and Surprizes</hi> may be sometimes
too quick and too hard for him; yet these cannot
reach his heart, nor change the setled measures of
his life; which are all pure and noble. And tho
the errors of this <hi>good man's</hi> conduct may in some
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65710:5"/>
things give advantages to bad men, who are always
severe censurers; yet his unspeakable comfort is, That
he can make his secret Appeals to God, who knows
the whole of his heart as well as the whole of his
life; and tho here and there, things may be found
that look not quite so well, and that do indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
worst of all to himself, who reflects the oftenest,
and thinks the most heinously of them; yet by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
Infinite Goodness with his own proportion of
it, and by finding that he can very gently pass over
many and great defects in one whose principles and
designs seem to be all pure and good, he from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
That those allowances must be yet infinitely
greater, where the Goodness is infinite; so being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
within himself, that his vitals, his inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and the scheme and course of his life are good,
he from thence raises an humble confidence in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which tho it does not, as indeed it ought not,
free him from having still low thoughts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
yet it delivers him from all dispiriting fear and
sorrow, and gives him a firm confidence in the love
and goodness of God, out of which he will often feel
an incredible source of satisfaction and joy, spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up in his mind. A man who is thus <hi>good in
the sight of God,</hi> has, as one may truly think, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
enough within himself. But this is not all
his reward, nor is it all turned over into a Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
We have here a fair particular given us, by
one that dealt as much both in Wisdom and Folly,
as ever man did; who run the whole compass of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
business, and learning, with the freest range, and
in the greatest variety, and who by many repeated
Experiments knew the strong and the weak sides of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65710:6"/>
things: He then who had sound the <hi>vanity,</hi> the <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi>
the <hi>sore travel,</hi> and the <hi>vexation of spirit,</hi> that
was in all other things; the many disappointments
that were given by them, and the painful reflections
that did arise out of them so sensibly, <hi>that they made
him hate life for the sake</hi> of all the <hi>labour</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to it, and <hi>even to make his heart despair of all
the travel he had undergone,</hi> gives us in these words
another view of the effect of true Goodness, and of
the happy consequences that follow it.</p>
            <p>The first of these is <hi>Wisdom,</hi> not the art of craft
and dissimulation; the cunning of deceiving or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
others: not only the views that some men
may have of the springs of humane nature, and the
art of turning these; which is indeed a Nobler
Scene of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> by which Societies are conducted
and maintained. But the chief acts and instances
of true Wisdom, are once to form right Judgments
of all things; of their value, and of their solidity;
to form great and noble thoughts of God, and just
and proper ones of our selves; to know what we
are capable of and fit for; to know what is the
true good and happiness of Mankind, which makes
Societies safe, and Nations flourish. This is solid
Wisdom, that is not mis-led by false appearances,
nor imposed on by vulgar opinions. This was the
Wisdom that first brought men together, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and corrected their natures; and established
all the art and good Government that was once
in the world; but which has been almost totally
defaced by the arts of <hi>Robbery</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> the true
names for <hi>Conquest;</hi> a specious colour for the two
worst things that humane nature is capable of, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
and Cruelty.</hi>

               <hi>Wisdom</hi> in gross, is the forming true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
the laying good Schemes, the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proper Instruments, and the chusing fit sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for doing the best and noblest things that can
arise out of humane nature. This is the <hi>defence</hi> as
well as the <hi>glory</hi> of Mankind: <hi>Wisdom gives life to
him that hath it, it is better than strength, and better
than weapons of war;</hi> it is, in one word, The Image of
God, and the Excellency of Man. It is here called
<hi>the Gift of God;</hi> the seed of it is laid in our Nature,
but there must be a proper disposition of body, a right
figure of brain, and a due temper of blood to give
it scope and materials. These must also be cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by an exact education; so that when all these
things are laid together, it is plain in how many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
<hi>Wisdom</hi> comes from God. There are also
particular happy flights, and bright minutes, which
open to men great Landskips, and give them a fuller
prospect of things, which do often arise out of no
previous Meditations, or chain of thought; and these
are flashes of light from its Eternal source, which
do often break in upon pure minds. They are not En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasms,
nor extravagant pretensions, but true views
of things, which appear so plain and simple, that
when they come to be examined, it may be justly
thought that any one could have fallen upon them,
and the simplest are always the likest to be the
truest. In short, a pure mind is both better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for an enlightning from above, and more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of receiving it; the natural strength of
mind is awakened as well as recollected; false
Biasses are removed; and let prophane minds
laugh at it as much as they please, there is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
commerce between God and the Souls of good
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65710:7"/>
men: They feel the influences of Heaven, and
become both the wiser and the better for them:
Their thoughts become nobler as well as sreer; and
no man is of so low a composition, but that with a
great deal of goodness, and a due measure of appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
he may become more capable of these, than
any other that is one the same level with him, as to his
natural powers, could ever grow to be, if corrupted
with Vice and Defilement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knowledge</hi> comes next. This is that which opens
the mind, and fills it with great Notions; the
viewing the Works of God even in a general sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,
gives insensibly a greatness to the Soul. But
the more extended and exact, the more minute and
severe, the Enquiry be, the Soul grows to be
thereby the more inlarged by the variety of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
that is made, either on the great Orbs
and Wheels that have their first motion, as well
as their Law of moving, from the Author of all;
or on the composition of Bodies, on the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
as well as the Irregularities of Nature; and
that Mimickry of its heat and motion that Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Fires do produce and shew. This Knowledge
goes into the History of Past Times, and Remote
Climates; and with those livelier Observations on
Art and Nature, which give a pleasant entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and amusement to the mind, there are join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in some, the severer studies, the more laborious
as well as the less-pleasant study of Languages, on
design to understand the sense, as well as the
discoveries of former Ages: and more particularly
to find out the true sense of the sacred Writings.
These are all the several varieties of the most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
parts of Knowledge; and these do spread over
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65710:7"/>
all the powers of the Soul of him that is capable
of them, a sort of nobleness; that makes him become
thereby another kind of Creature than otherwise
he ever could have been: He has a larger size of Soul,
and vaster thoughts, that can measure the Spheres,
and enter into the Theories of the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
that can observe the proportion of Lines, and
Numbers, the composition and mixtures of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
sorts of Beings. This World, this Life, and
the mad Scene we are in, grow to be but little
and inconsiderable things, to one of great views
and noble Theories; and he who is upon the true
scent of real and useful Knowledg, has always
some great thing or other in prospect; new Scenes
do open to him, and these draw after them Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,
which are often made before, even those
who made them were either aware, or in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of them: These by an endless Chain are
still pointing at, or leading into further Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
In all those, a man feels as sensibly, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes
as plainly an improvement of the strength
and compass of his powers, from the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which ignorance and sloth bring upon them,
as a man in health of Body can distinguish between
the life and strength which accompany it, and
the flatness and languidness that Diseases bring
with them. This enlarges a Man's Empire over the
Creation, and makes it more intirely subject to
him by the Engines it invents to subdue and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it, by the dissections in which it is more
opened to his view, and by the observation of
what is profitable or hurtful in every part of it:
from which he is led to correct the one; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
the other. This leads him into the knowledge
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65710:8"/>
of the hidden Vertues that are in Plants and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals;
this teaches him to purify these, from the
Allays that are wrapped about them, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them by other mixtures. In a word, this
lets a man into the Mysteries of Nature: It gives
him both the Keys that open it, and a Thread
that will lead him further than he durst promise
himself at first. We can easily apprehend the
surprising joy of one born blind, that after many
years of darkness, should be blest with sight, and
the leaps and life of thought, that such a
one should feel upon so ravishing a change; so
the new Regions into which a true Son of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
enters, the new Objects and the various
shapes of them that do daily present themselves
to him, give his mind a flight, a raisedness, and a
resined joy, that is of another nature than all the
soft and bewitching Pleasures of sense. And tho
the highest reaches of knowledge do more clearly
discover the weakness of our short-sighted powers,
and shew us difficulties that gave us no pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
because we did not apprehend them; so that in
this respect, he that <hi>increases knowledge, increases
sorrow:</hi> Yet it is a real pleasure to a Searcher after
Truth, to be undeceived, to see how far he can
go, and where he must make his stops: It is true,
he finds he cannot compass all that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to himself, yet he is both in view of it,
and in the way to it, where he finds so many
noble Entertainments, that though he cannot
find out the whole work of God, which the
<hi>Preacher</hi> tells us, that though <hi>a wise man thinks
he may know it, yet even he shall not be able
to find it out;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles.8.17.</note> yet he has this real satisfaction in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65710:8"/>
himself, that he has greater Notions, nobler Views,
and finer Apprehensions then he could have ever
fallen upon in any other method of life.</p>
            <p>This <hi>knowledge,</hi> though it may seem to be meerly the
effect of thought, of labour, and industry, yet it is
really <hi>the gift of God.</hi> The capacity of our Powers,
and the disposition of our Minds are in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
born with us: The circumstances and accidents of
our lives depends so immediately upon Providence,
that in all these respects, Knowledge comes, at least
in the preparations to it, from God: There are also
many happy openings of thought, which arise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the minds of the Searchers after it, to which they
did not lead themselves by any previous inferences,
or by the comparing of things together. That,
which the Language of the World calls <hi>chance, happy
accidents,</hi> or <hi>good stars,</hi> but is according to a more
sanctified dialect <hi>Providence,</hi> has brought many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
secrets by unlookt for hits, to the knowledge
of men. The use of the Loadstone, and the extent of
sight by Telescopes, besides a vast variety of other
things that might be named, were indeed the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
gifts of God to those who first fell upon
them. And the profoundest Inquiries into the greatest
mysteries of Nature, have and still do own this, in so
particular a manner, that they affirm, that things
that in some hands, and at some times are successful
almost to a Prodigy, when managed by others with
all possible exactness do fail in the effects of them so
totally, that the difference can be resolved into
nothing, but a secret direction and blessing of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65710:9"/>The third gift that God bestows on the Good man
is <hi>joy,</hi> and how can it be otherwise, but that a good, a
wise and knowing Man, should rejoyce both in God
and in himself; in observing the works and ways of
God, and in feeling the Testimony of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
with himself. He is happy in the situation of
his own mind, which he possesses in a calm contented
evenues of Spirit. He has not the agitations of Passions,
the ferment of Designs and Interests, nor the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of Appetite which darken the Mind, and create
to it many imaginary Troubles, as well as it encreases
the Sense of the real Ones which may lye upon ones
Person or Affairs. He rejoyces in God when he sees
so many of the hidden beauties of his Works, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
fitness and contrivance, the curious disposition,
and the vast usefulness of them, to the general good
of the whole. These things afford him so great a
variety of Thought, that he can dwell long on
that noble exercise without flatness or weariness. He
rejoyces in all that he does, his imployments are much
diversified, for the newness of his discoveries which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
often, gives him as often a newness of joy.
His views are great, and his designs are noble; even
to know the works of God the better, and to render
them the more useful to Mankind. He can discover
in the most despised Plant, and the most contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mineral that which may allay the miseries of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Life, and render multitudes of men easie and
happy. Now to one that loves Mankind, and that
adores the Author of our Nature, every thing that
may tend to Celebrate his praises, and to sweeten the
lives of Mortals, affords a joy that is of an exalted
and generous kind. If this at any time goes so far
as to make him a little too well pleased with the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65710:9"/>
discoveries he has made, and perhaps too nicely jealous
of the honour of having done those Services to the
World, even this which is the chief and the most
observed defect, that is much magnified by the ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
censures of great Men, who must fix on it
because they can find nothing else, yet I say even this
shews the fullness of <hi>joy</hi> which <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
bring to good minds, they can give them so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
a pleasure, that it cannot be at all times governed:
and if it break out in any time in less decent instances,
yet certainly those who have deserved so highly of
the Age in which they have lived, and who have been
the Instruments of so much good to the World, receive
a very unworthy return, if the great services they
have done Mankind do not cover any little imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
especially when that is all the Allay that can
be found in them, and the only instance of humane
Frailty that has appeared in them. But if the joy
that wisdom and knowledge give, is of so pure and
so sublime a Nature; there is yet another occasion for
<hi>joy,</hi> that far exceeds this: it arises from their integrity
and goodness which receives a vast accession from this,
that it is <hi>in the sight of God,</hi> seen and observed by
him, who accepts of it now, and will in due time
reward it. The terror of mind, and the confusion of
face that follows bad actions, and the calm of thought
and chearfulness of look that follows good ones,
are such infallible indications of the suitableness or
unsuitableness that is in these things to our natures,
that all the contempt with which Libertines may
treat the Argument will never be able to overcome
and alter the plain and simple sense that Mankind
agrees in upon this head. A good Man finds that
he is acting according to his nature, and to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65710:10"/>
best principles in it, that he is living to some good
end, that he is an useful piece of the World, and is
a mean of making both himself and others wiser
and happier, greater and better. These things give
him a solid and lasting joy, and when he dares ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to that God to whom he desires chiefly to
approve himself, who knows his Integrity and sees
how thoroughly <hi>good</hi> he is, even in his secretest
Thoughts and Intentions, he does upon that feel a <hi>joy</hi>
with in himself, that carries him through all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of Life; and makes most accidents that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to him pleasant, and all the rest supportable.
He believes he is in the favour of God, he
hopes he has some Title to it, from the Promises of
God to him; and his grace in him. He can see Clouds
gather about him and threaten a Storm, and though
he may be in circumstances, that render him
very unfit to suffer much hardship; yet he can endure
and bear all things, because he believes all God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
He may sometimes from the severe Sense that
he has of his duty, be too hard, and even injust to
himself, and the seriousness of his Temper may give
some harsher thoughts too great occasion, to raise
disquiet within him; but when he takes a full view
of the infinite goodness of God, of the extent of his
Mercy, and of the riches of his Grace; he is forced to
throw out any of those Impressions, which Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
may be able to make upon him: and even those
when reflected on in a truer light, though they might
have a little interrupted his <hi>joy,</hi> yet tend to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
it, when by them he perceives, that true strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of principles that governs him, which makes him
tender of every thing that might seem to make the
least breach upon his purity and holiness, even in the
smallest Matters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65710:10"/>I will go no further upon my Text, nor will I
enter upon the Reverse of it, that is in the following
words, <hi>but to the Sinner he giveth travel, to gather and
to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before
God.</hi> These I leave to your Observation: they are
too foreign to my subject to be spoke to, upon
this occasion, that leads me now to the melancholy
part of this sad Solemnity.</p>
            <p>I confess I enter upon it, with the just Apprehensions
that it ought to raise in me: I know I ought here to
raise my stile a little, and to triumph upon the Honour
that belongs to Religion and Virtue, and that appeared
so eminently in a life, which may be considered as a
Pattern of living: and a Pattern so perfect, that it
will perhaps seem a little too far out of sight, too
much above the hopes, and by consequence above
the Endeavours of any that might pretend to draw
after such an Original: which must ever be reckoned
amongst the Master-pieces even of that <hi>Great Hand</hi>
that made it. I might here challenge the whole Tribe
of <hi>Libertines</hi> to come and view the usefulness, as well as
the Excellence of the Christian Religion, in a Life
that was entirely Dedicated to it: and see what
they can object. I ought to call on all that were so
happy, as to know him well, to observe his temper
and course of life, and charge them to sum up and
lay together the many great and good things that
they saw in him, and from thence to remember al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to how vast a Sublimity the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
can raise a mind, that does both throughly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, and is entirely governed by it. I might here also
call up the Multitudes, the vast Multitudes of those who
have been made both the wiser and the easier, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and the happier by his means; but that I might
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65710:11"/>
do all this with the more advantage, I ought to bring all
at once into my memory, the many happy hours that
in a course of nine and twenty years conversation
have fallen to my own share, which were very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and free for above half that time: that have
so often both humbled and raised me, by seeing how
Exalted he was, and in that feeling more sensibly my
own Nothing and Depression, and which have always
edified, and never once, nor in any one thing been
uneasie to me. When I remember how much I saw in
him, and learned, or at least might have learned
from him; When I reflect on the gravity of his very
Appearance, the elevation of his Thoughts and
Discourses, the modesty of his Temper, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
of his whole Deportment, which might have
served to have forced the best thoughts even upon
the worst minds, when, I say, I bring all this together
into my mind; as I form upon it too bright an
<hi>Idea</hi> to be easily received by such as did not know
him; so I am very sensible that I cannot raise it,
equal to the thoughts of such as did. I know, the
limits that custom gives to Discourses of this kind,
and the hard Censures which commonly follow them:
These will not suffer me to say all I think; as I perceive
I cannot bring out into distinct thoughts all that of
which I have the imperfect hints and ruder draughts in
my mind, which cannot think Equal to a Subject so
far above my own level. I shall now therefore shew
him only in Perspective, and give a General, a very
general View of him, reserving to more leisure and
better opportunities, a farther and fuller account of
him. I will be content at present to say but a Little
of him; but that Little will be so very much, that I
must expect that those who do never intend to imitate
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65710:11"/>
any part of it, will be displeased with it all. I am
resolved to use great Reserves; and to manage a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
which how much soever it may melt me,
shall not carry me beyond the strictest measures, and
I will study to keep as much within <hi>bounds,</hi> as he
lived beyond <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will say nothing of the <hi>Stem</hi> from which he sprang:
that watered Garden, watered with the blessings and
dew of Heaven, as well as fed with the best Portions of
this life, that has produced so many noble Plants, and
has stocked the most Families in these Kingdoms of
any in our Age, Which has so signally felt the
effects of their humble and Christian Motto, <hi>God's
Providence is my Inheritance.</hi> He was the only Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of five, that had none of these Titles that sound
high in the World; but he procured one to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which without derogating from the dignity of
Kings must be acknowledged to be beyond their
Prerogative. He had a great and noble Fortune;
but it was chiefly so to him, because he had a great
and noble Mind to imploy it to the best Uses. He
began early to shew both a Probity and a Capacity;
that promised great things: and he passed through
the Youthful parts of life, with so little of the <hi>Youth</hi>
in him, that in his travels while he was very young
and wholly the Master of himself he seemed to be
out of the reach of the disorders of that Age, and
those Countries through which he passed. He had a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
and a purity laid so deep in his Nature, that those
who knew him the earliest have often told me, that
even then <hi>Nature</hi> seemed entirely sanctified in him.
His piety received a vast encrease as he often owned to
me from his Acquaintance with the great Primate of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> the never enough admired <hi>Vsher,</hi> who as he was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65710:12"/>
very particularly the Friend of the whole Family, so
seeing such Seed and beginnings in him, studied to
cultivate them with due care. He set him chiefly to
the Study of the Scriptures in their <hi>Original Languages,</hi>
which he followed in a course of many Years, with so
great exactness he could have quoted, all remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Passages very readily in <hi>Hebrew:</hi> and he read the
<hi>New Testament</hi> so diligently in the <hi>Greek,</hi> that there
never occurred to me an occasion to mention any
one passage of it, that he did not readily repeat in
that language. The use of this he continued to the
last, for he could read it with other mens Eyes;
but the weakness of his sight forced him to disuse the
other, since he had none about him that could read
it to him. He had studied the Scriptures to so good
purpose, and with so critical a strictness, that few
men whose Profession oblige them chiefly to that
fort of learning have gone beyond him in it: and
he had so great a regard to that <hi>Sacred Book,</hi> that
if any one in Discourse had dropped any thing that
gave him a clearer view of any passage in it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it with great pleasure, he examined it accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
and if it was not uneasie to him that offered
it, he desired to have it in writing. He had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest
Veneration for the great <hi>God of Heaven and
Earth,</hi> that I have ever observed in any Person. The
very Name of God was never mentioned by him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Pause and a visible stop in his Discourse, in
which one that knew him most particularly above
twenty Years, has told me that he was so exact, that
he does not remember to have observed him once to
fail in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65710:12"/>He was most constant and serious in his secret Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to God; and indeed it appeared to those,
who conversed most with him in his Enquiries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Nature, that his main design in that, on which
as he had his own Eye most constantly, so he
took care to put others often in mind of it, was
to raise in himself and others vaster Thoughts
of the Greatness and Glory, and of the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodness of God. This was so deep
in his Thoughts, that he concludes the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of his <hi>Will,</hi> which relates to that <hi>Illustrious</hi>
Body, the Royal Society, in these Words, <hi>Wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them also a happy success in their laudable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
to discover the true Nature of the Works of
God; and praying that they and all other Searchers
into Physical Truths, may Cordially refer their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
to the Glory of the Great Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to the Comfort of Mankind.</hi> As he was a
very Devout Worshipper of God, so he was a no
less Devout Christian. He had possessed himself
with such an amiable view of that Holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
separated from either superstitious Practices or
the sourness of Parties, that as he was fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the Truth of it, and indeed wholly
possessed with it, so he rejoyced in every discovery
that Nature furnisht him with, to Illustrate it, or to
take off the Objections against any part of it. He
always considered it as a System of Truths, which
ought to purifie the Hearts, and govern the Lives
of those who profess it; he loved no Practice
that seemed to lessen that, nor any Nicety that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
Divisions amongst Christians. He thought
pure and disinteressed Christianity was so Bright
and so Glorious a thing, that he was much troubled
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65710:13"/>
at the Disputes and Divisions which had arisen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
some lesser Matters, while the Great and the
most Important, as well as the most universally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
Truths were by all sides almost as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
neglected as they were confessed. He had
therefore designed, tho' some Accidents did, upon
great Considerations, divert him from settling it
during his Life, but not from ordering it by his
Will, that a liberal Provision should be made for
one, who should in a very few well digested Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
every year, set forth the Truth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion in general, without descending to
the Subdivisions among Christians, and who should
be changed every Third year, that so this Noble
Study and Imployment might pass through many
Hands, by which means many might become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Argument. He was at the Charge of
the Translation and Impression of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into the <hi>Malyan</hi> Language, which he sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> He gave a Noble Reward
to him that Translated <hi>Grotius</hi> his incomparable
Book of the <hi>Truth of the Christian Religion</hi> into
<hi>Arabick,</hi> and was at the Charge of a whole Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
which he took care to order to be scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in all the Countries where that Language is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
He was resolved to have carried on the
Impression of the New Testament in the <hi>Turkish</hi>
Language, but the Company thought it became
them to be the doers of it, and so suffered him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to give a large share towards it. He was at 700 l.
Charge in the Edition of the <hi>Irish</hi> Bible, which he
ordered to be distributed in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
liberally both to the Impressions of the
<hi>Welsh</hi> Bible, and of the <hi>Irish</hi> Bible for <hi>Scotland.</hi> He
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65710:13"/>
gave during his Life 300 l. to advance the design
of propagating the Christian Religion in <hi>America,</hi>
and as soon as he heard that the <hi>East-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
were entertaining Propositions for the like
design in the <hi>East,</hi> he presently sent 100 l. for a
Beginning and an Example, but intended to carry
it much further, when it should be set on foot to
purpose. Thus was his Zeal lively and effectual in
the greatest and truest concerns of Religion; but
he avoided to enter far into the unhappy Breaches
that have so long weakened, as well as distracted
Christianity, any otherwise than to have a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
to all those Opinions and Practices, that
seemed to him to destroy Morality and Charity.
He had a most particular zeal against all Severities
and Persecutions upon the account of Religion. I
have seldom observ'd him to speak with more Heat
and Indignation, than when that came in his way.
He did throughly agree with the Doctrines of our
Church, and conform to our Worship; and he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of the main of our Constitution, but he
much lamented some abuses that he thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
still among us. He gave Eminent Instances
of his value for the Clergy. Two of these I shall
only mention. When he understood what a share
he had in Impropriations, he ordered very large
Gifts to be made to the Incumbents in those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
and to the Widows of such as had died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had resolved on this Charity. The Sums that,
as I have been Informed, by one that was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in two Distributions that were made, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon those two Occasions, to near 600 l. and
another very liberal one is also ordered by his Will,
but in an indefinite Sum, I suppose, by reason of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65710:14"/>
present condition of Estates in <hi>Ireland:</hi> So plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
did he supply those who served at the Altar,
out of that which was once devoted to it, though
it be now converted to a Temporal Estate. Another
Instance of his sence of the Sacred Functions
went much deeper. Soon after the Restoration
in the Year Sixty, the great Minister of that time,
pressed him both by himself and by another, who
was then likewise in a high Post, to enter into <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
He did it not meerly out of a respect to him
and his Family, but chiefly out of his regard to the
Church, that he thought would receive a great
strengthening, as well as a powerful Example from
one, who, if he once entered into Holy Orders,
would be quickly at the Top. This he told me
made some Impressions on him. His mind was, even
then at Three and thirty, so intirely disingaged
from all the Projects and Concerns of this World,
that as the prospect of Dignity in the Church, could
not move him much, so the Probabilities of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good in it, was much the stronger Motive. Two
things determined him against it; one was, That his
having no other Interests, with relation to Religion,
besides those of saving his own Soul, gave him, as
he thought, a more unsuspected Authority, in
writing or acting on that side: He knew the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Crew fortified themselves against all that was
said by Men of our Profession, with this, That it
was their Trade, and that they were paid for it:
He hoped therefore, that he might have the more
Influence, the less he shared in the Patrimony of
the Church. But his main Reason was, That he
had so high a sense of the Obligations of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal
care; and of such as watch over those Souls,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65710:14"/>
which <hi>Christ purchased with his own blood,</hi> and for
which they must give an Account, at the last and
great day, that he durst not undertake it, especially
not having felt within himself an <hi>Inward motion to
it by the Holy Ghost;</hi> and the first Question that is
put to those who come to be Initiated into the
Service of the Church, relating to that <hi>Motion,</hi> he
who had not felt it, thought he durst not
make the step; least otherwise he should have
lyed to the Holy Ghost: So solemnly and seriously
did he judge of Sacred Matters. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
to the Church; and went to no separated As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
how charitably soever he might think of
their Persons, and how plentifully soever he might
have relived their necessities. He loved no narrow
Thoughts, nor low or superstitious Opinions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and therefore as he did not shut himself up
within a Party, so neither did he shut any Party out
from him. He had brought his Mind to such a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that he was not apt to be imposed on; and his
Modesty was such, that he did not dictate to others;
but proposed his own Sense, with a due and decent
distrust; and was ever every ready to hearken to what
was suggested to him by others. When he differed
from any, he expressed himself in so humble and so
obliging a way, that he never treated Things or
Persons with neglect, and I never heard that he
offended any one Person in his whole Life by any
part of his Deportment: For if at any time he saw
cause to speak roundly to any, it was never in Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or with any reproachful or indecent Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
And as he was careful to give those who
conversed with him, no Cause or Colour for displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
so he was yet more careful of those who were
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65710:15"/>
absent, never to speak ill of any; in which he was
the exactest Man I ever knew. If the Discourse
turn'd to be hard on any, he was presently silent;
and if the Subject was too long dwelt on, he would
at last interpose, and between Reproof and Ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
divert it.</p>
            <p>He was exactly civil, rather to Ceremony; and
though he felt his easiness of access, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of many, all Strangers in particular, to be
much with him, made great wasts on his Time;
yet as he was severe in that, not to be denied when
he was at home, so he said he knew the Heart of
a Stranger, and how much eased his own had been,
while travelling, if admitted to the Conversation
of those he desired to see; therefore he thought
his Obligation to Strangers, was more than bare
Civility, it was a piece of Religious Charity in
him.</p>
            <p>He had for almost Forty years, laboured under
such a feebleness of Body, and such lowness of
Strength and Spirits, that it will appear a surprizing
thing to imagine, how it was possible for him to
Read, to Meditate, to try Experiments, and to
write as he did. He bore all his Infirmities, and
some sharp Pains, with the decency and submission
that became a Christian and a Philosopher. He had
about him all that unaffected neglect of Pomp in
Cloaths, Lodging, Furniture and Equipage, which
agreed with his grave and serious course of Life.
He was advised to a very ungrateful simplicity of
Diet; which by all appearance was that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
him so long beyond all Mens expectation;
this he observed so strictly, that in a course of above
Thirty years, he neither eat nor drank to gratifie
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65710:15"/>
the Varieties of Appetite, but meerly to support
Nature; and was so regular in it, that he never
once transgressed the Rule, Measure, and Kind,
that was prescribed him. He had a feebleness in his
Sight; his Eyes were so well used by him, that it will
be easily imagined he was very tender of them,
and very apprehensive of such Distempers as might
affect them. He did also imagine, that if sickness
obliged him to lie long a Bed, it might raise the
Pains of the Stone in him to a degree that was above
his weak Strength to bear; so that he feared that
his last Minutes might be too hard for him; and
this was the Root of all the caution and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that he was observed to live in. But as to
Life it self, he had the just indifference to it, and
the weariness of it, that became so true a Christian.
I mention these the rather, that I may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to shew the Goodness of God to him, in the
two things that he feared; for his sight began not to
grow dimm above four Hours before he died;
and when death came upon him, he had not been
above Three hours a Bed, before it made an end
of him, with so little uneasiness, that it was plain
the Light went out, meerly for want of Oil to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Flame.</p>
            <p>But I have looked too early to this Conclusion of
his Life, yet before I can come at it, I find there
is still much in my way. His Charity to those that
were in Want, and his Bounty to all Learned Men,
that were put to wrastle with Difficulties, were so
very extraordinary, and so many did partake of
them, that I may spend little time on this Article.
Great Summs went easily from him, without the
Partialities of Sect, Country, or Relations; for he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65710:16"/>
considered himself as a part of the Humane Nature,
and as a Debtor to the whole Race of Men. He
took care to do this so secretly, that even those who
knew all his other Concerns, could never find out
what he did that way; and indeed he was so strict
to our Saviour's Precept, that except the Persons
themselves, or some one whom he trusted to convey
it to them, no body ever knew how that great
share of his Estate, which went away invisibly,
was distributed; even he himself kept no Account
of it, for that he thought might fall into other
hands. I speak upon full knowledge on this Article,
because I had the honour to be often made use of by
him in it. If those that have fled hither from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
of <hi>France,</hi> or from the Calamities of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
feel a sensible sinking of their secret Supplies, with
which they were often furnished, without knowing
from whence they came, they will conclude, that they
have lost not only a Purse, but an Estate that went
so very liberally among them, that I have reason to
say, that for some years his Charity went beyond
a Thousand Pound a year.</p>
            <p>Here I thought to have gone to another Head, but
the Relation he had, both in Nature and Grace, in
living and dying, in friendship, and a likeness of
Soul to another Person, forces me for a little while
to change my Subject. I have been restrain'd from
it by some of her Relations; but since I was not
so by her self, I must give a little vent to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and to Friendship; to a long Acquaintance and
a vast Esteem. His sister and he were pleasant in their
Lives, and in their Death they were not divided;
for as he lived with her above Fourty years, so he
did not outlive her above a Week. Both died from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65710:16"/>
the same Cause, Nature being quite spent in both.
She lived the longest on the publickest Scene, she made
the greatest Figure in all the Revolutions of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
for above fifty Years, of any Woman of our
Age. She imployed it all for doing good to others, in
which she laid out her Time, her Interest, and her
Estate, with the greatest Zeal and the most Success
that I have ever known. She was indefatigable as
well as dextrous in it: and as her great Understanding,
and the vast Esteem she was in, made all Persons in
their several turns of Greatness, desire and value her
Friendship; so she gave her self a clear Title to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
her Interest with them for the Service of others, by
this that she never made any use of it to any End or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of her own. She was contented with what she
had; and though she was twice stript of it, she never
moved on her own account, but was the general Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
for all Persons of Merit, or in want: This had
in her the better Grace, and was both more Christian
and more effectual, because it was not limited within
any narrow Compass of Parties or Relations. When
any Party was down, she had Credit and Zeal enough
to serve them, and she employed that so effectually,
that in the next Turn she had a new stock of Credit,
which she laid out wholly in that Labour of Love, in
which she spent her Life: and though some particular
Opinions might shut her up in a divided Communion,
yet her Soul was never of a Party: She divided her
Charities and Friendships both, her Esteem a well as
her Bounty, with the truest Regard to Merit, and her
own Obligations, without any Difference, made upon
the Account of Opinion.</p>
            <p>She had with a vast Reach both of Knowledge and
Apprehensions, an universal Affability and Easiness
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65710:17"/>
of Access, a Humility that descended to the meanest
Persons and Concerns, an obliging Kindness and Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to advise those who had no occasion for any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Assistance from her; and with all these and many
more excellent Qualities, she had the deepest Sense of
Religion, and the most constant turning of her
Thoughts and Discourses that way, that has been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in our Age. Such a <hi>Sister</hi> became such a <hi>Brother;</hi>
and it was but suitable to both their Characters, that
they should have improved the Relation under which
they were born, to the more exalted and endearing
one of <hi>Friend.</hi> At any time a Nation may very ill
spare one such; but for both to go at once, and at such
a time, is too melancholly a Thought; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Decline of their Age, and the Waste of
their Strength, yet it has too much of Cloud in it, to
bear the being long dwelt on.</p>
            <p>You have thus far seen, in a very few hints, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Sorts and Instances of Goodness that appeared in
this Life, which has now its Period; that which gives
value and lustre to them all, was, that whatever he
might be in the sight of Men, how pure and spotless
soever, those who knew him the best, have reason to
conclude, that he was much more so in the sight of God;
for they had often Occasions to discover new Instances
of Goodness in him; and no secret ill Inclinations did
at any time shew themselves. He affected nothing that
was solemn or supercilious. He used no Methods to
make Multitudes run after him, or depend upon him.
It never appeared that there was any thing hid under
all this appearance of Goodness, that was not truly so.
He hid both his Piety and Charity all he could. He
lived in the due Methods of Civility, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
assume the Authority which all the World was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65710:17"/>
ready to pay him. He spoke of the Government even
in Times which he disliked, and upon occasions which
he spared not to condemn, with an exactness of respect.
He allowed himself a great deal of decent chearfulness,
so that he had nothing of the moroseness, to which Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
think they have some right; nor of the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
which Men of an extraordinary pitch of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
go into, sometimes, without being well aware of
them. He was, in a word, plainly and sincerely in
the sight of God, as well as in the view of Men, <hi>a good
Man, even One of a Thousand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which comes next to be considered, is the share
that this <hi>good Man</hi> had in those Gifts of God, <hi>Wisdom
Knowledg, and Joy.</hi> If I should speak of these, with
the copiousness which the Subject affords, I should go
too far even for your Patience, tho I have reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it would hold out very long on this Occasion. I will
only name things which may be enlarged on more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in another way. He had too unblemish'd a candor
to be capable of those Arts and Practices that a false and
deceitful World may call <hi>Wisdom.</hi> He could neither
lie nor equivocate; but he could well be silent, and by
practising that much, he cover'd himself upon many
uneasy Occasions. He made true Judgments of Men
and Things. His Advices and Opinions were solid
and sound; and if Caution and Modesty gave too
strong a Biass, his Invention was fruitful to suggest
good Expedients. He had great Notions of what
Humane Nature might be brought to; but since he
saw Mankind was not capable of them, he withdrew
himself early from Affairs and Courts, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Distinction with which he was always treated
by our late Princes. But he had the Principles of an
English-man, as well as of a Protestant, too deep in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65710:18"/>
him to be corrupted or cheated out of them; and in
these he studied to fortify all that conversed much
with him. He had a very particular Sagacity in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
what Men were fit for; and had so vast a
Scheme of different Performances, that he could soon
furnish every Man with Work that had leasure and
capacity for it; and as soon as he saw him engaged in
it, then a handsom Present was made to enable him to
go on with it.</p>
            <p>His Knowledg was of so vast an Extent, that if it
were not for the variety of Vouchers in their several
sorts, I should be afraid to say all I know. He carried
the study of the Hebrew very far into the Rabbinical
Writings, and the other Oriental Languages. He
had read so much of the Fathers, that he had formed
out of it a clear Judgment of all the eminent Ones.
He had read a vast deal on the Scriptures, and had
gone very nicely through the whole Controversies of
Religion; and was a true Master in the whole Body
of Divinity. He run the whole Compass of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Sciences; and though he did not set himself
to spring new Game, yet he knew even the abstrusest
Parts of Geometry. Geography in the several parts of
it, that related to Navigation or Travelling, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Books of Travels were his Diversions. He
went very nicely through all the Parts of Physick,
only the tenderness of his Nature made him less able
to endure the exactness of Anatomical Dissections,
especially of living Animals, though he knew
these to be the most instructing: But for the History
of Nature, Ancient and Modern, of the Productions
of all Countries, of the Virtues and Improvements of
Plants, of Oars and Minerals, and all the Varieties
that are in them in different Climates; He was by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65710:18"/>
much, by very much, the readiest and the perfectest
I ever knew, in the greatest Compass, and with the
truest Exactness. This put him in the way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
all that vast variety of Experiments, beyond any
Man, as far as we know, that ever lived. And in
these, as he made a great progress in new Discoveries,
so he used so nice a strictness, and delivered them
with so scrupulous a Truth, that all who have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
them, have found how safely the World may
depend upon them. But his peculiar and favourite Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
was Chymistry; in which he engaged with none
of those ravenous and amitious Designs, that draw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
into them. His Design was only to find out Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to see into what Principles things might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
and of what they were compounded, and to
prepare good Medicaments for the Bodies of Men.
He spent neither his Time nor Fortune upon the vain
pursuits of high Promises and Pretensions. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
kept himself within the Compass that his
Estate might well bear: And as he made Chymistry
much the better for his dealing in it, so he never
made himself either the worse or the poorer for it. It
was a Charity to others, as well as an Entertainment
to himself, for the Produce of it was distributed by his
Sister, and others, into whose Hands he put it. I
will not here amuse you with a List of his astonishing
Knowledg, or of his great Performances this way.
They are highly valued all the World over, and his
Name is every where mentioned with most particular
Characters of Respect. I will conclude this Article
with this, in which I appeal to all competent Judges,
that few Men (if any) have been known to have made
so great a Compass, and to have been so exact in all the
Parts of it as he was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:65710:19"/>As for Joy, he had indeed nothing of Frolick and
Levity in him, he had no Relish for the idle and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Madness of the Men of Pleasure; he did not
waste his Time, nor dissipate his Spirits into foolish
Mirth, but he possessed his own Soul in Patience, full
of that solid Joy which his Goodness as well as his
Knowledg afforded him; He who had neither Designs
nor Passions, was capable of little Trouble from any
Concerns of his own: He had about him all the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of good Nature, as well as all the Softness of
Friendship, these gave him a large share of other Mens
Concerns; for he had a quick sense of the Miseries of
Mankind. He had also a feeble Body, which needed to
be look'd to the more, because his Mind went faster
than that his Body could keep pace with it; yet his
great Thoughts of God, and his Contemplation of his
Works, were to him Sources of Joy, which could never
be exhausted. The Sense of his own Integrity, and
of the Good he found it did, afforded him the truest
of all Pleasures, since they gave him the certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of that <hi>Fulness of Joy,</hi> in the Sight of which he
lived so long, and in the Possession of which he now
lives, and shall live for ever; and this spent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
Body shall then put on a new Form, and be
made a fit Dwelling for that pure and exalted Mind in
the final Restitution. I pass over his Death, I looked
at it some time ago, but I cannot bring down my
Mind from the elevating Thoughts that do now arise
into that depressing one of his Death; I must look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it into the Regions of Light and Glory, where
he now dwells.</p>
            <p>The only Thought that is now before me, is
to triumph on the Behalf of Religion, to make
our due Boast of it, and to be lifted up (I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65710:19"/>
said proud) upon this occasion: how divine
and how pure a thing must that Religion be in it self,
which produced so long a Series of great Effects,
thorow the whole Course of this shining Life? What
a thing would Mankind become if we had many such?
And how little need would there be of many Books
writ for the Truth and Excellency of our Religion,
if we had more such Arguments as this one Life has
produced? Such single Instances have great Force in
them; but when they are so very Single, they lose much
of their Strength by this, that they are ascribed to
Singularity, and something particular in a Man's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and Inclinations, that makes him rise above
common Measures. It were a Monopoly for any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
or Sort of Men to ingross to themselves the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which arises from the Memory of so great a
Man. It is a Common not to be inclosed. It is large
enough to make a whole Nation, as well as the Age he
lived in, look big and be happy: But above all it gives
a new Strength, as well as it sets a new Pattern to all
that are sincerely zealous for their Religion. It shews
them in the simplest and most convincing of all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
what the Humane Nature is capable of, and
what the Christian Religion can add to it, how far it
can both exalt and reward it. I do not say that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one is capable of all he grew to; I am very sensible
that few are; nor is every one under equal Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
for the Service of the Universe, there must be a
vast Diversity in Mens Tempers, there being so great
a Variety of Necessities to be answered by them: but
every Man in every Imployment, and of every size of
Soul, is capable of being in some Degrees <hi>good in the
sight of God;</hi> and all such shall receive proportioned
Degrees of <hi>Wisdom, Knowledg and Joy;</hi> even though
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65710:20"/>
neither their Goodness nor these Accessions to it, rise
up to the Measure of him who was a while among us,
indeed <hi>one of a thousand,</hi> and is now but one of those <hi>ten
thousand times ten thousand</hi> that are about the Throne,
where he is singing that Song which was his great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
here, as it is his how endless Joy there;
<hi>Great and marvellous are thy Works, O Lord God Almighty;
and just and true are thy Ways, O King of
Saints.</hi> To follow him in the like Exercises here, is
the sure Way to be admitted to join with him in those
above; to which God of his infinite Mercy bring us
all in due time, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
