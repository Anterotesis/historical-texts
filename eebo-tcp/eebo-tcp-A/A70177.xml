            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Lately met with Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi>'s Book, and was a little surprized to find my self by name concern'd in it, as one of those that had been the occasion of his writing about the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> I had in my Discourse of <hi>Reason</hi> accus'd the Dissenters of decrying the sober use of our Faculties under the misapplied names of <hi>vain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, carnal Reason,</hi> and the <hi>wisdom</hi> of this <hi>World;</hi> and some others whom he mentions, had spoke to the like purpose: He therefore thought it <hi>necessary that they should vindicate themselves from those aspersions, and endeavour to give a stop to those groundless, and unjust clamours,</hi> page 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53428:3"/>Now whether those Accusations are just or not, I appeal to any one that can remember but twenty years past, and hath been in the least acquainted with the Preaching, Writings, and Discourses of those men in <hi>their</hi> times: How far they are reformed since, I do not know; but I have never heard of their Recantations, nor have they taken any care to convince the world that their private Desks are more sober then their publick Pulpits were. On this occasion, Sir, I cannot but take notice, how hard it is to deal with the people of this sort, when we speak or write against their Opinions, Practices, and Declarations, and those that have been most publick and notorious: If there happen to be two, or three, or some very few unknown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, of a little different temper, they will be ready to flie upon us as false accusers, and such as <hi>traduce</hi> the whole <hi>Party for the Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a few.</hi> Thus you know it hath hapned to some excellent late Books, that have given the most just, and lively descriptions of the humour of Non-conformists, which have been vilified and rayl'd at as slanderous Invectives and Abuses; because some few that go with them, are somewhat less foolish, and extravagant then the rest: According to which Rule, it will be untrue to say, that Lions and Bears are wild and dangerous creatures, because some of them have been tam'd and made gentle: and a man may not affirm the Crow is black, because some are greyish: and now and then a Bird of that species by extraordinary accident may be white. If among the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters there are so many sober Assertors of the necessity, and useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Reason in the affairs of Religion, 'tis very much that they have not all this while stood up, and reprov'd the dangerous Follies, and Extravagancies of their Brethren that have opened the door to Atheism, and Enthusiasm by their ignorant Railings against it. And since they have thought fit to be silent in this matter, how should we know that there are men of such sober principles among them. The Declamations and violent Out-cries against Reason we have heard till our ears have tingled: but the justifications of the judgments of Reason in Religion have been such private whispers, that hitherto we have heard little, or nothing of them from these men: and I might ask Mr. <hi>F.</hi> how it comes about, that persons so zealous against error, who were still pelting each other both from Press and Pulpit upon every petty difference in opinion, should let pass so many rude Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of our Faculties, as they needs must frequently hear, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53428:3"/>
the least reproof, or opposition of them, if so many have been so very Orthodox in this point, as he would have us to believe? But I say no more of that.</p>
               <p>The Author hath a double justification of his Party against our Charge. We have the first, page 7. <hi>They are a people, so far as I know, innocent of all undue reflections upon Reason.</hi> The other is, I <hi>Robert Ferguson</hi> do acknowledge the use of Reason in Religion in 274 pages; <hi>ergo, Our late pretended Rational Divines do traduce the Non-conformists in suggesting that they are defamers of Reason,</hi> page 62. This is the sum and strength of the whole Discourse, to which a short answer will suffice.</p>
               <p>For my part, though I have been drawn into some Philosophical Controversies, yet I never begun any; and though I have received some publick Provocations to ingage in the Disputes of Religion, yet hitherto my disinclination to them hath kept me unconcern'd: But notwithstanding this indisposition, Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi>'s title, and the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he made of me, as one of the occasions of his Book, inclined me to look into his Discourse with design of further Vindication of our Faculties, if that Essay had given me any reason for it: But I soon perceived that this supposed Adversary was a Friend, and one that liked my Book so well, as to borrow the main things of his from it; though as he is pleased to say of <hi>Des Cartes, He was not so ingenious to confess at whose Breasts he had suckt, nor out of whose Garden he had gathered his best Flowers:</hi> And 'twas a little unkindly done of him to mention my Name where he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed I had erred; and to take no notice of it, when he thought I had done so well as to deserve to be transcribed. Indeed he hath enlarged in the proof of some Principles of Religion by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, in which he hath been more beholden to other men: But in the Notions that strictly appertain to the main state of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he hath been pleased to credit and enforce my Observations by the addition of his Suffrage and Authority. When I saw how Affairs went, I left the close perusal of his Book, and only cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorily skim'd over his Pages, casting my eye here and there, as it hapned; and in that running reading I observ'd these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things and Expressions, in which the Gentleman very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to my great honour hath concur'd with me.</p>

               <p>Thus, Sir, I have given you some Instances among many, of the faithfulness of M. <hi>Ferguson</hi>'s Memory, or of his Phrase-Book: There is no doubt but they have furnished him as well out of other Writers, but I have neither the humor nor the leisure to make further search after stoln Goods: Only I cannot but take notice to you that this is the Man that divers of his Party glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in, as their elegant and rational Writer, and urge him as a great proof of the partiality and injustice of those who will not allow <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> to write either good Sense or good Language; If either of these be in his Book, you may ghess by this <hi>Specimen</hi> how little Honour is reflected upon them from it: And if others would claim their Feathers, as I have called for some of mine, I believe, he would have scarce enough left to cover theirs or his own nakedness.</p>
               <p>I remember such Discoveries were once made upon another Champion of the Cause, M. <hi>Hickman;</hi> who had also furnished his Pack with Lace and Ribband borrowed from his Neighbours Shops. 'Tis pity but these men had Judgments to choose, for then they would put better Books into the hands of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers. But when they take this Liberty, I would advise them not to fall foul upon the Owners, while they have their Goods in their hands; nor to pick their Pockets then when they are confidently pleading their own Truth and Honesty against them: If this Gentleman had let me alone, I had likely never known this quality of his; but unluckily he hath detected himself, as

I was much puzzled before to give an account of the inequality of M. <hi>Ferguson</hi>'s Style and Reasoning: for his Words are sometimes proper and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, his Arguments strong and weighty, at other times his Phrase is barbarous and pedantick, and his Reasonings childish: and I always observed that he writ best upon some trite and beaten Argument, where he had no Adversary; but take him out of the road of Common Places and Phrase-Books, and he could neither write consistently with himself, nor any thing to the purpose. This gave me a great suspicion of the man, that he was a mere Collector, and that his Book was made just as the

                  <hi>Epicuraeans</hi> fansie the World was, by the accidental Concourse of Atoms, and may serve for a Confutation of that wild <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> it being a plain Demonstration, how impossible it is to make a good Book out of the best Common-Places and Collections, unless a wise man have the composing of it.</p>
               <p>Upon the receipt of your Letter, which made so pleasant a discovery of the man, I had the Curiosity to enquire a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in requital of your kindness, I have here sent you some of his gleanings from other Authors, though so changed and transformed, and found in such ill Company, that I fear those worthy persons will be ashamed to own them.</p>
               <p>And because M. <hi>Ferg.</hi> with the usual confidence of a bold <hi>Scot,</hi> pretends a very particular Friendship with that excellent Person, Sir <hi>Charles Wolseley,</hi> I shall first take notice how bold he has made with him; which I suppose he did upon the Authority of that old Saying, <hi>All things are common among Friends;</hi> and therefore he might challenge as good a right to Sir <hi>Charles</hi> his Writings, as himself.</p>

               <p>The same may be truly affirmed of <hi>those positive media</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>by which the Divine authority of the Scripture may be rationally

demonstrated,</hi> which indeed he has cast into a different method; but as far as I observe, has nothing but what is particularly discours'd by Sir <hi>Charles</hi> from <hi>page</hi> 179. to the end of the Book.</p>
               <p>In one thing indeed Master <hi>Ferguson</hi> takes the confidence to differ from Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> whether Miracles be always a certain demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth of any Doctrine? or whether God may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times permit Impostors to work Miracles for the tryal of our Faith? This latter Sir <hi>Charles</hi> affirms, Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> denies; which is not civilly done to dispute such a nice point with his friend, which he confesses is not very material, when he had borrowed from him all his substantial and material notions. But the best of it is, Sir <hi>Charles</hi> has no need to stand to his Courtesie in this matter, and it is well for him he has not.</p>
               <p>And upon this occasion I cannot but take notice, how Master <hi>Ferguson</hi> deals with <hi>Des Cartes;</hi> he charges him with affirming, <hi>Deum posse fallere, si velit,</hi> that God can deceive, if he please. Now Sir you know very well upon what occasion <hi>Des Cartes</hi> said this; it was when in order to free his mind from the prejudices of sense and education, and popular opinions, he set himself to doubt, as far as possibly he could, as long as there was the least imaginable pretence for doubting; and therefore doubts whether there be a God, or any thing else: and whether this God be not a deceiver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Master <hi>Ferguson</hi> might as well challenge <hi>Des Cartes</hi> with denying that he himself had any body, or that there were any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal objects, such as the Sun, Moon, and Stars; as with affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that God might deceive, if he pleased; for he says the one as much as the other, while he was in this doubting humour, and only upon a design to come to some first Principle, which he could not doubt of; and to lay the foundations of a more certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and therefore he immediately adds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Et certe cum nullam oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionem habeam existimandi aliquem Deum esse deceptorent, neo quidem adhuc satis sciam, utrum sit aliquis Deus, valde tenuis, &amp;, ut ita lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quar, metaphysica dubitandi ratio est, quae tantum ex ea opinione depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det; ut autem etiam illa tolletur, quamprimum occurret occasio, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare debeo, an sit Deus, &amp; si sit, an possit esse deceptor, hac enim re ignorata, non videor de ulla alia plane certus esse unquam posse,</hi> Medit. Tertia. <hi>i. e.</hi> Since I have no occasion at all to think, that God is a


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53428:10"/>
deceiver; nor as yet am certain, whether there be a God, or not, this opinion (of Gods power to deceive) is but a very slender and metaphysical reason of doubting: However that we may remove this too, as soon as things are ripe for that inquiry, we must examine whether there be a God? and if there be one, whether he can be a deceiver? for while we are ignorant of this, I cannot see how we can be throughly certain of an thing. And accordingly, when in his method he had proved the being of God, he proves too, that he cannot deceive us, and founds the truth and certainty of our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon it. And in the second objections he is charged with assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Deum non posse mentiri aut decipere,</hi> that God cannot lye or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; which they say is contrary to the opinion of many School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And in his Answer to these Objections, to which Master <hi>Ferguson</hi> refers us, he owns the charge, and defends himself from their exceptions. By this we may see, how well skilled Mr. <hi>Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> is in <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his Philosophy, or what a brow he has, to charge that upon <hi>Des Cartes</hi> as his professed opinion; the contrary of which he makes the ground of all certainty.</p>
               <p>Such another wise discourse he has, <hi>page</hi> 123. of Infallibility; the result of which is, that our Faith is infallible, though we are not infallibly assured: but this is beyond my first design, only I could not but take this occasion to show you, what a man of reason this is, when he argues at his own natural rate, and dares forsake his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: and it were very easie to make it appear, that he has not one good argument, but what he has borrowed from some late Modern Authors, who are far enough from being Fanaticks; which is an excellent way of proving, that Fanaticks are great friends to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>

               <p>I confess, Sir, I am very sick of this undertaking; for it is so far from being pleasant, that it is grievous to me, to write one line meerly to expose any man: but I thought it necessary to take down the confidence of this Author, who makes a great shew of ancient and modern Learning, by transcribing out of some late Writers, whose credit and reputation at the same time he endeavours to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine. I am glad to find, that he reads so good Books, which I doubt not, but would make him wiser in time, if he would consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as well as read: It is no fault indeed to use those arguments, which have been used by other men, and it is possible sometimes to hit upon the very same expressions, or some very like; but when a man shall run through a book, and take the whole Series of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without owning his Masters; when he shall take out whole Sentences and Paragraphs out of so many Authors, of so vastly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent styles, it plainly discovers an empty Head, a barren Fancy, and a vain-glorious Mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
