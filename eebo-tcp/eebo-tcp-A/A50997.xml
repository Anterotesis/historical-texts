            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Was powder'd and painted, nay drest in her Hair;</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Of each huffing Gallant she would make an Ass,</hi>

                  <hi>Of this wretched Miser she made a meer Ass,</hi>
               </l>

               <l>'Tis known this old Miser he seldom did eat</l>
               <l>From Years-end to Years-end a meal of good meat:</l>
               <l>Except it was given him freely, and then</l>
               <l>He would eat as much as five labouring Men;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>He hapn'd to meet with this beautiful Lass</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>VVho fed him with Pig, but he paid for the sawce.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>It hapn'd this Miser went over the Rounds</l>
               <l>And under his Arm he had sevenscore Pounds:</l>
               <l>The which he was going that Morning to lend:</l>
               <l>This Lady she met him and said My dear Friend</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Your former good Nature lays claim to a Glass:</hi>
               </l>

               <l>The Miser he told her he dare not drink Wine</l>
               <l>Nor any such liquors until he had Din'd:</l>
               <l>Quoth we, since she here did so luckily meet,</l>
               <l>I now am resolved to give thee a treat:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Away to her chamber they straightways did pass,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>She fed him with pig, but he paid for the sawce.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:48760:1"/>
               <l>A Dinner she straightways provided with speed,</l>
               <l>The Miser he like an old Farmer did feed,</l>
               <l>Concluding that he should have nothing to pay,</l>
               <l>But to eat and drink, aye and so go his way:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Lady supply'd him with Glass after Glass,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>She found him with Pig, but he paid for the Sawce.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Lady supply'd him with Liquor good store,</l>
               <l>'Till he was not able to drink any more;</l>
               <l>Full Bowls of Canary he had drank so deep,</l>
               <l>That all of a sudden he fell fast asleep:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thus of this Old Miser she made a meer Ass,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>She fed him with Pig, but he paid for the Sawce.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She shook him, and finding that he would not wake,</l>
               <l>The Sevenscore Pound she did presently take;</l>
               <l>Then locking the Miser up in an old Chest,</l>
               <l>This brings me, in short, to the Cream of the Jest:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thus her waggish purpose was soon brought to pass,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>She fed him with Pig, but he paid for the Sawce.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now he having told her before where he dwelt,</l>
               <l>In this subtle manner she cunningly dealt;</l>
               <l>Straight calling a Porter to finish this strife,</l>
               <l>The Miser she sent in a Chest to his Wife,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Without e're a Penny in Silver, alas!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thus she fed him with Pig, but he paid for the Sawce.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Lady she gave him two Shillings at first,</l>
               <l>And bid him be sure he was true to his Trust,</l>
               <l>Now for to deliver his Burthen with Care,</l>
               <l>For why I must tell you it is Merchants Ware:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And thus the poor Miser was made a meer Ass,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>She fed him with Pig, but he paid for the Sawce.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now just as the Porter came to his own Door,</l>
               <l>The Miser awak'd, and loudly did roar;</l>
               <l>The honest poor Porter was frightn'd alack!</l>
               <l>Supposing that he had Old Nick at his back:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But it was the wretched Old Miser, alas!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>VVho was fed with Pig, but he paid for the Sawce.</hi>

               <l>The Wife she was frightn'd this Wretch to behold,</l>
               <l>The Miser stark-mad for his Silver and Gold;</l>
               <l>But all was in vain, tho' he search'd <hi>Smithfield</hi> round,</l>
               <l>The Lady of Pleasure was not to be found:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thus of an Old Miser she made a meer Ass,</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>She gave him roast Pig, but he paid for the Sawce.</hi>
