            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But God, the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Iewes, the God of Italians as of Engliſhmen, no accepter of perſons, or reſpecter of place, hath euen in Italie many (peraduenture thouſands) which haue not bowed their knees vnto Baal, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting ſome out of each nation &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to make vp the ſumme of his elect.

The time wherin he liued I find not certainly ſet downe of any: but this is moſt certaine, that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued about the time of <hi>Conradus Pellica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> ſome 70 or 80 yeares ago, and that <hi>Pellican</hi> did verie much profite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by <hi>Brucioli,</hi> or <hi>Brucioli</hi> by <hi>Pellicans</hi> writings: which is the more probable, by how much the more <hi>Brucioli</hi> hath in his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentary, beſides that which is out of <hi>Pellican</hi> tranſlated into his books word for word in diuerſe places. The order &amp; method which he obſerued in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie is ſuch as deſerueth to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated of all men that labour in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in eaſie and facill places of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either to be altogether ſilent, or very ſhort and briefe: in harder places to be

more plentifull and copious, in no place ſpending paper and inke in idle and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable queſtions, ſuch as tend not to edification. As to diſpute the caſe in this Commentarie vpon the Canticles, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the three bookes which <hi>Salomon</hi> wrote, he wrote the Canticles in the firſt or ſecond place, as the Iewes ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, or laſt of all, as all the Latine wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do conſent. Whether there be more perſons then foure, or whether this book be meant literally of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, or myſtically of the Church: theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions being farre aboue the reach of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſort of people, he omitteth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely. And becauſe all writers with one voyce conſent that the Church is meant by the Spouſe, he ſo taketh it without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further adoe, inſtructing vs in theſe points of religion, neceſſary to be taught of him and vnderſtood of vs. That the Church here militant conſiſteth of two parts, a viſible and an inuiſible: that in the Church Chriſt muſt beare rule, and not Peter; that Gods word muſt be heard, and not mens traditions: finally he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth

They ſay there be no ſpiders in Ireland, their houſes are built of ſuch a wood as breedeth none: O that England were as Ireland in this reſpect, and that all our houſes were built of this kind of timber, then would the houſe of God go better forward then it doth, and we ſhold be fitter men to be temples of the holy Ghoſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are: but now the world is as ful of theſe wicked creatures, as euer Egipt ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with frogs: there was no houſe, no place in Egypt but there were frogges to be found: there is no place, no houſe almoſt in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d where there are not ſome of theſe venimous ſpiders to be found: a man ſhal find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery wherein citie &amp; fields, in beds and at boord, in court &amp; country.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His booke of the Canticles is a holy and admirable booke, very ſpirituall, full of myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and most hidden ſenſes; whereby it is moſt euident, that they haue bene not a litle deceiued, which go about to diminish the credit and authoritie thereof: for becauſe herein are contained, ſundry enterchangeable diſcourſes, and dialogues of mutuall loue betweene the bride and the bridegrome, therefore forſooth haue they thought it good to call this booke in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; as if it were not an vſuall matter with the holy Ghoſt in the holy Scripture, to ſet down the ſincere and vnfained loue of God and the Church, vnder the figure of chaſt and holy wedlocke: as alſo to diſcouer the force of wickedneſſe and Idolatrie, by the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the adulterous woman, as it is to be ſeene in the ſecond and third of Ieremie,
<pb facs="tcp:18986:10"/>
and in the ſixteenth Chapter of Ezechiel. Beſides all this, there are certaine places in this booke, whereby no otherwiſe then as it were by certaine beames and lights, this point is made ſo cleare and manifeſt, that we may very well ſay without any maner of doubt or wauering at all, that this Treatiſe is not carnally and literally, but ſpiritually and myſtically to be vnderſtood. In ſuch ſort, that I hold this for an vnfallible and certaine truth, that there are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and contained in this ſmall booke, the exceeding great affection and loue of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the holy Church of the faithfull beleeuers, the neceſſarie vſe of the word of God, the profite and pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, the efficacie of faith, and heat of charity. Furthermore we learne to know what are the operations of the ſpirit, and what are the works of the flesh: &amp; briefly, that which doth any maner of way co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne or reſpect the Church; and all this, vnder the figuratiue talk and communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Bridegroome and the Spouſe. Now Christ is the Bridegroome, as it is in the <hi>3.</hi> of Iohn verſe <hi>29.</hi> He that hath the
<pb facs="tcp:18986:10"/>
bride, is the bridegrome, and the Church is his ſpouſe. Hoſea Chapter <hi>2.</hi> Thou shalt call me <hi>Iſhi</hi> or my husband, &amp; I wil marry thee vnto me for euer. And this ſpouſe is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on with her young maidens, that is to ſay, with the particular ſoules of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which do follow after the odoriferous and ſauery ointments of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. And the bridegrome likewiſe hath his friends that do follow &amp; acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany him, to wit, the true Bishops, &amp; ſincere Prechers of the word of God, which he cals vnto him to eate &amp; drinke, &amp; make merry with him. Theſe men heare the voyce of the Church, that is to ſay, the words of Chriſt. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, this is not ſo to be vnderſtood, but that all the faithfull may rightly terme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the bridegrome. The title or inſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the Song of Songs, as if therin were contained ſongs which did farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all other ſongs, in plenty of holy myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and they are called the ſongs of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or Salomons ſongs, becauſe hee writ them being inſpired by the holy Ghoſt of the true Salomon Ieſus Chriſt. VVe reade of many Canticles or ſongs in the ſcripture, as
<pb facs="tcp:18986:11"/>
the ſong of Moyſes, Deborah, Ioſua, Anna, Dauid, Abacuck, and others, but this booke compriſeth not one onely ſong which Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſong, but there are many ſongs herein contained, all written in one book, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning one matter, and one argument; wherin are expreſsed moſt truly the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, faith, loue, ioy, delights, and diuerſe kinds of benefits (not without veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; earneſt affections) wherewith our moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing &amp; merciful redemer doth follow his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect with inexplicable graces, by the grace &amp; fauor of the almighty God. So that they being ſtirred vp by the holy Ghoſt, do with certaine vnſpeakeable affections of loue, regard, behold, and approch neere vnto the diuine grace and bountie of God: deſiring moſt earneſtly and deuoutly to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, approoued, and daily more and more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed and fauoured of him: in ſuch ſort that if there be found any error or fault in their liues and conuerſations (as ſpots and blots or wennes in their forheads do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen) yet that they may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed or reiected for this or the like things, or have any cauſe to diſtruſt his mercifull
<pb facs="tcp:18986:11"/>
kindneſſe or louing fauor, but that the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of louers, may be the renewing of loue. For louers being iealous one of another are mutually and ſuddenly prouoked vnto wrath, &amp; as ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly reconciled and pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and afterwards they become greater friends then they were before. This then is the principall intent and purpoſe of this booke. This is the ſong of God the ſpouſe, vnto euery faithfull ſoule, and generally vnto al the Church. Neither are we to look for any preciſe order in this dialogue or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, which is not vſuall amongſt perfect louers, where all things how ſoeuer and where ſoeuer done, are taken in very good part, where, euen errors, ignorances, and miſtakes are accepted of, and laught at, and where quarrels, contentions, ſtrife, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and blowes alſo many times, are heard of, approued, and in moſt friendly ſort ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. And in this booke, there be foure ſundry ſorts of perſons to be obſerued of vs. The bridegrome, and the friends of the bridegrome; the ſpouſe and her young dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels or waiting maides, and as the bride ſaith one thing, and the bridegrome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb facs="tcp:18986:12"/>
ſo the young virgins that waite on the ſpouſe, and the friends of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome, are brought in ſpeaking contrarie and diuerſe things, yet all of them betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning godly &amp; kind affections. Now by the bridegrome we may (as we have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto you) vnderſtand Chriſt, by the ſpouſe the Church, by the friends of the bridegrome the Preachers of the Goſpell, &amp; ſuch as shew vs the way vnto Chriſt, and direct vs vnto his eternall marriage, and heauenly banquet. The young virgins are the faithfull ſoules, which do alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Spouſe, and we muſt note, that the Spouſe doth alwayes long to bee in the houſe, bed, or other ſecret and inward place, with her welbeloued, according vnto the cuſtome of women, and the bridegrome, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of men, calleth the Spouſe foorth into the vineyeard, or abroad into the fields, or vnto ſome ſuch places: becauſe ſo it is, and it is moſt true, that the Church of it ſelfe would willingly (if ſo be that it were poſsible) bring vp her children in quiet reſt and tranquility, but he on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, thinketh it good to exerciſe her
<pb facs="tcp:18986:12"/>
with many tribulations, and perſecutions, to the ende that she may the better come vnto the conſideration of eternall things, and alſo that if matters do happen well and happily, yet, that amiddeſt her proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity she may not bee too far delighted with the pleaſures and entiſing baits of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world: but alwayes hope, and grone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an heauenly countrey.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18986:13"/>
as to ſay, to purchaſe and obtaine his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, loue and goodwill. Her requeſt is then that her ſinnes may be forgiuen her, and that ſhe may reobtaine the fauor of God by him, ſhe confeſſeth her ſinnes vnto God, crauing pardon for the ſame, and ſhe calleth for the Goſpell, becauſe ſhe would faine heare the comfortable and pleaſant voyce of remiſſion of ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pronounced through Ieſus Chriſt: and the ſpouſe requeſteth the amiable kiſſes of the bridegromes owne mouth, to ſhew &amp; teſtify the great deſire which ſhe had to heare Chriſt alone, and no other ſpeake, &amp; to make knowne the vehemencie of her goodwill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him For it had bene ſufficient to haue ſaid: <hi>Let him kiſſe me</hi>: but the loue of faith, &amp; holy delight of the ſoule, made her adde theſe wordes, <hi>with the kiſſes of his mouth</hi>: as if ſhe ſhold haue ſaid, The greateſt thing that I can wiſh for in this world, is to obtaine the loue &amp; fauor of God, which I ſee I can not obtain by any other, but by thee my Sauior Chriſt. For I know this, and am moſt certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of it, that I ſhall neuer be able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe my ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the merits of my works, but by thee alone, when it ſhall pleaſe thee to vouchſafe me the benefite of thy ſweete kiſſes, that is to ſay, of thy grace and loues. <hi>For thy loue is better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wine.</hi> Here the ſpouſe yeeldeth a reaſon, why ſhe wold ſo willingly
<pb facs="tcp:18986:14"/>
be kiſſed of him, becauſe his loue is better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any precious thing whatſoeuer, which ſhe expreſſeth by wine. Where by the way we muſt note, that by his loue is meant the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell, and the graces which the bridegroome brought into the world with him: eſpecially if we conſider, howe much this doctrin which ſo proceedeth from the loue of the ſpouſe, is better then that wherewith ſhe was ſuſtained and comforted before the coming of the bridegrome, and therefore ſeeing the abundant grace &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wil of this her bridegroome towards her, ſhe breaketh forth into theſe words: <hi>Thy loue is better then wine,</hi> that is to ſay, aboue that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine wherewith ſhe was comforted of the auncient fathers: ſo that this is the ſenſe of the whole verſe: I deſire the kiſſes of thy mouth, that is, I looke for my redemption at thy hands, becauſe thy precepts and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are milke and food to nouriſh me vp vnto eternall life, and they are better then the Law, which ſtrikes vs downe to the ground with remembrance of our ſinnes, and aboue all other doctrines which do not ſtrengthen but kill the ſimple and weake ones, as wine, which either killeth young children, or elſe maketh them drunke. Thus then the Church being inflamed as the ſpouſe towardes her bridegroome, crieth out continually, <hi>Let him
<pb facs="tcp:18986:14"/>
kiſſe me with the kiſſes of his mouth.</hi> That is to ſay, let the Bridegroome himſelfe, come to teach and inſtruct, to ſaue and deliuer mee, neither let him teach me any longer by the mouth of the Patriarkes and Prophets, but let him come himſelfe to informe mee with the words of his own mouth, and ſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to receiue the kiſſe of my mouth: that is, let him not deſpiſe mee, or turne away his face from me, ſeeking &amp; asking after the way of ſaluation. And this was then fulfilled as we do verily beleeue, when ſitting on the mountaine he taught his diſciples, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as the Bridegrome is woont to do vnto the ſpouſe, he ſaid: Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit, for theirs is the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god: &amp; many other things which follow there in the ſame chapter.

is not to be vnderſtood of the mind, but of the place: for although the citie be ruinated and deſtroyed: yet neuertheleſſe, the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of faith remaineth inuiolable for euer and euer, ſo that this is the meaning; he kept not that place, that is, hee retayned not that place where the vineyard ſhould haue bene, and where it was planted at the firſt, being rooted by God the father, out of that barren and vnfertile ſoyle, and planted in a more fertile place among the Gentiles. So the Church is this vine, or elſe by this you may vnderſtand the ſoules of the faithfull, which are planted in faith, rooted in charitie, tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched about with the furrowes of good diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, repayred with the teares of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and watered with the wordes of the Preacher: and hence commeth it, that they doe ſo abound in all manner of diuine fruit, that is to ſay, in gladneſſe and holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion. In like maner we may ſay, that faith is the vine, the branches vertues, the grapes good workes, the wine deuotion. Moreouer the vineyard is religion, the husbandman the father, the ſonne the vine, and the iuſt the branches thereof. God the father is the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, becauſe he digges and ditches it in confeſſion and contrition, proynes it with ſprinckling of teares. And indeed the Sonne is the vine, becauſe he is the foundation of
<pb facs="tcp:18986:21"/>
religion, becauſe no man can lay any other fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but that which is already laid, which is Chriſt Ieſus, by whom euery building doth grow vp to be a holy te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple.

thou feedeſt,</hi> where the ſonne of righteouſnes feedeth and reſteth himſelfe, I meane Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne of God, which neuer ſetteth, hauing alwayes a meridian brightneſſe ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning round about him. And the Church knoweth the time, that is to ſay, the noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide, at what time the bridegrome doth reſt &amp; take his repaſt, but ſhe knoweth not the place where. Alſo ſhe knoweth, that with the lanterne of the word it is not poſſible to find him, vnleſſe it pleaſe him to manifeſt and ſhew himſelfe by opening the hidden ſenſes and darke myſteries of the ſcriptures with his key: and this knowledge alſo can not be gotten, vnleſſe it be obtayned by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the bridegrome, and therefore ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſteth him that it would pleaſe him to make himſelfe knowen vnto her, and ſhew her where he feedes &amp; abides. And euen now he feedeth her, whileſt that he lighteneth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth, and inflameth her, which is in the heate of the day, to wit, at noone, or midday. So that we are not able to endure the great glorie of his face, vnleſſe wee be couered with the vayle of his fleſh, which he tooke; and euen now we do reſt vnder the ſhadowe of his wings, by being made partakers of his heauenly graces. <hi>For why ſhould I be.</hi> And what is that the ſpouſe requireth here in this place, vnleſſe it be that Chriſt ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:18986:22"/>
ſhew her theſe things, leaſt that ſhe ſhould be compelled <hi>to turne aſide to the flockes of his companions.</hi> But what are theſe companions, but the faithfull, &amp; chiefly thoſe which haue any office or ſuperioritie ouer the reſt. But of theſe there be ſome true, ſome lying and falſe brethren. The true brethren do not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the flockes vnto themſelues but vnto Chriſt, neither doe they make themſelues heads of the Church, but humbly ſubmit both themſelues and their whole flockes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſts gouernment, acknowledging him to be their Lord and head: and they are very much afraid leaſt the flockes ſhould follow them, and therefore they doe ſtudie by all manner of meanes how to preuent theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and I am of <hi>Peter,</hi> I am of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and I am of <hi>Apollo.</hi> But their onely care and deſire is, to bring euery one to ſay and confeſſe thus much, I am of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now contrariwiſe, they which are the falſe followers and companions of Chriſt Ieſus, do not leade or gather the flockes vnto their bridegrome Chriſt, but vnto themſelues, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelues heads and ouerſeers ouer thoſe flockes: wherefore, the true Church ſaith, <hi>I will not turne aſide to the flockes of them which are called thy companions</hi>: chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do any thing then this, becauſe, that if the flockes do follow any other ſhepheard
<pb facs="tcp:18986:22"/>
but thee, they muſt needes periſh and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: and theſe flockes do wander and go aſtray, becauſe during the time of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode here in this wicked world, they can find no reſt or peace, but are alwayes troubled &amp; diſquieted in mind, and therefore the ſenſe and meaning of theſe words is this: I doe heartily deſire thee (ô my God and Sauiour) that it would pleaſe thee, and none but thee, to take the paines to teach mee thoſe things which it is meete for me to know, to the end that my iudgement and minde may not bee offuſcated and darkened with the cloudes of errors and hereſies, but that my vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding may be lightened with the truth of thy word, which ſhineth as cleare as the Sunne doth at noone day: ſo that I may not fall into any error or falſe opinion, being miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led &amp; miſguided by them which make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of great knowledge and wiſedome, and which continue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare their doctrine and the precepts of their fond hearts, with the truth of thy word.</p>

ſaith vnto her, <hi>O thou the faireſt among women,</hi> that is to ſay, among the Churches, becauſe the Church &amp; congregation of the faithfull howſoeuer it ſeeme in the ſight of men to be blacke and contemptible, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the only begotten ſonne of God Chriſt Ieſus, eſteemeth and iudgeth her to be fairer and better, then all the Synagogues of the wicked. O wonderfull great beautie and fairenes, which God himſelfe doth ſo greatly commende and approoue, by calling her the faireſt among women. Indeed other women are faire, becauſe they are Gods creatures, who is moſt glorious, &amp; admirable in all his workes: but thou O my Spouſe, exceedeſt them all, becauſe thou art to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all, becauſe thou art adorned with my beautie, in regard whereof he ſayth vnto her, <hi>O thou the faireſt among women,</hi> if thou know not of thy ſelfe where I feed &amp; reſt at noone day, then go foorth out of thy ſelfe, &amp; renounce thy ſelfe and all things elſe for the loue of me, beare thy croſſe particularly, and truſt not to thy owne opinion or workes at all. Furthermore, depart from the flockes of my companions, and from the dregs &amp; filth of humane traditions: and laſtly, lay aſide all truſt and confidence in the fleſh, otherwiſe, neuer hope to find the place where I do feed and reſt my ſelfe at nooneday, becauſe he is
<pb facs="tcp:18986:24"/>
not worthie of my loue, that for the loue of me is not content to forſake all things, and himſelfe alſo if neede be. At length he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where his feeding and abiding is to wit, in the footſteps of the flocks of the Church, and neere the tabernacles of ſhepheards: of theſe flockes are all they which we know to be of the Church, and their footſteps are thoſe things which we read of them to haue bene gratefull and acceptable vnto God, and theſe are the ſteppes of the Patriarkes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles of the true faith in the word of God, &amp; all thoſe things which God doth worke and bring to paſſe in them by charitie. And we muſt follow after thoſe ſteps where he feedeth and lyeth, becauſe he comforteth all them, which truely feede on him in their hearts by faith, and he granteth them true peace of conſcience, which is as much as to reſt and feede with Chriſt. The litle goates, and the feeble and weake hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are thoſe which beleeue in the Lord. The ſhepheards may be tearmed, thoſe whom he ſendeth abroad with authoritie to preach the Goſpell, who by publiſhing abroad among the people the ſincere word of God, do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and giue them food of eternall life, by giuing them the bread of Gods word in due ſeaſon, which if they did not, they would not be accounted true ſhepheards and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſpeaketh as it were, after this ſort vnto the ſpouſe, ô my deare ſpouſe, the time was when thou waſt in a miſerable caſe, the priſoner and bondſlaue of the Diuell, and therfore as farre eſtranged as might be from me; but loe, I haue now ſet thee at libertie, I haue freed and redeemed thee out of the hands of the diuell, and by the vertue of my word and ſpirite, I will ſo glorifie thee that thou ſhalt be like vnto the glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of Angels.

And this is ſpoken to this end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that we ſhold know that all thoſe which are without Chriſt, are but as it were horſes which draw in the Chariot of Pharaoh, that is to ſay, are vnder the rule and guiding of him, which driues the Chariot, to wit, the Diuell: but as many as are of Chriſt, &amp; hold with him, they are put into Gods coach, that is to ſay, are altogether ruled and gouerned by him. Therefore by the notable troupe of horſes of God, we muſt needes vnderſtand the Church, by reaſon of the multitude of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are contained in it, and of ſtore of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall armour and weapons of faith &amp; iuſtice, and for the inuincible force and ſtrength of the ſpirit, and noble victorie ouer her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>Thy cheekes are comely.</hi> Finally he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his owne workes in the ſpouſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſpouſe is not otherwiſe faire or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And here by the way, let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious reader diligently obſerue this, that the Church ſpeaketh vnto the bridegrome, and inuiteth him vnto the quiet reſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his bed, becauſe ſhe knoweth full wel that all kind of reſt and quietneſſe without him, is grieuous, miſerable, and vngodly: wherefore ſhe ſayth, <hi>Our bed is greene,</hi> or our peace or the peace which is common vnto vs both, is flouriſhing, greene, pleaſant, ſweet, and delectable: as if ſhe ſhould haue ſaid, that both of vs are to lie in the ſelfe ſame bed, which bed, is furniſhed and prepared
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18986:28"/>
ready for vs, therefore you muſt take me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bed to you, that is, all the pleaſure that I take muſt needes proceed and iſſue out from you, and ſo the Church doth ſhewe vs what an earneſt deſire ſhee hath to reſt with Chriſt, and therfore ſhe ſaith with <hi>Peter</hi>: It is good for vs to be here. And that which followeth in the latter end of the chapter, <hi>Our rafters are of Cypreſſe,</hi> is a type or figure of the elect, which by contemning &amp; deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all earthly &amp; temporall things, grow to be eternall and incorruptible, as are our Cypreſſe or Cedar trees.</p>

And finally, <hi>I am the lillie of the valleys,</hi> that is, all pleaſure, ſweetneſſe and delight vnto my elect: and Chriſt may fitly be called a flower, becauſe whiles he weedeth vp the thornes of ſinnes, hee doth not a litle decke and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne the hill of his ſpouſe, and beautie of his iuſtice. <hi>Like a lilly among the thornes.</hi> The name of lillies is ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times taken in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the beauty of the faithfull, which is hid and had in Chriſt. <hi>Hoſea</hi> chap. 14. verſ. 6.

And to ſeek the bridegrome in the night time, or in the dark, is as much as to ſeeke him in their own works, or in the traditions and conſtitutions of men, where it is not poſſible to find him, becauſe they are full of darkneſſe and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. So then the ſpouſe the Church ſpeaketh theſe words, or the like in effect; Being pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the guiltineſſe of mine own ſinfull conſcience, and labouring in my chamber &amp; bed, that is to ſay, truſting in mine own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or worthineſſe, I ſought the fauour and loue of my husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, becauſe indeed I thought to haue obtained &amp; purchaſed eternall bliſſe and happineſſe by the workes of the law, and thus hauing a long time ſought it here, I could not find it: becauſe his loue commeth not from our merits and worthineſſe, but of his meere good will &amp; fauour. <hi>I will riſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now,</hi> that is to ſay, whiles that I doe goe about to ſeeke him out of me, <hi>and go about in the citie by the ſtreetes, and by the open pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> to ſeeke my Sauiour and husbande, the foundation of my happineſſe, and that in the religion of the Gentiles, and doctrine of the Philoſophers, I found him not likewiſe.

by them: and laſtly, to hope moſt conſtantly for their ſaluations by the merits of Chriſts workes, wherefore the ſpouſe here in this place ſheweth, that ſhe was not a litle deceiued, when ſhe ſought him diligently, but with humaine diligence and induſtrie, and vpon the full confidence of her owne workes.

paſt a litle from their humaine ſtudies and ſpeeches, to ſee whether I could find anie more certaine ſteppes and footings, as it were of my ſaluation and peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which I had ſought a long time, but neuer as yet found, at the length, leauing all humaine helpes and Doctors, I buſied my ſelfe to make inquirie after him in the bookes of the holy ſcripture, being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the inſtinct of the holy Ghoſt, whom I doe loue moſt entirely, as being the ſenſe of pietie and ſolide truth: for it is onely Gods ſpirit, which ſatisfieth and filleth the mind of man, deſirous of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and leadeth his diſciples into all manner of truth, by teaching them the wordes of God. And here I finde, that not onely my vnderſtanding is informed, but alſo that my affections are inflamed within me, and that I am preſently able to diſcerne errors and falſehood from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of true doctrine, and to receiue and intertaine in my heart the true peace of conſcience, quieting and contenting my ſelfe in my husband, and all this happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for no other cauſe, but becauſe I haue found out Chriſt my Sauiour and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that is to ſay, him who hath obtained the ſpirit of grace, which is neuer ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and abſtracted from the truth, that

which is his is mine, for otherwiſe I knowe that I ſhould ſuddenly periſh and come to nought, and forthwith Chriſt doth ſeeke the ſaluation of thoſe which liue in wickedneſſe and error.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18986:52"/>
the true vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the faith, may make one true Catholike Church of all the elect, which are gathered &amp; aſſembled together of all nations, tongues, and kingdomes of the earth, as who would ſay: This my beautifull ſpouſe flyeth vnto me for refuge, not only from <hi>Libanus,</hi> but from all the corners and quarters of the earth, eſchuing the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Sathan, and treacheries of falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and heretikes, ſuch as they haue medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and thought vpon lying on their beds, to deſtroy and annoy the Church. And in that he ſaith, that <hi>his heart was wounded,</hi> wee are to note the greatneſſe of his loue which he beareth towards the Church, which he for good cauſe calleth his ſiſter and ſpouſe: firſt, becauſe ſhee is become his heauenly bedfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, &amp; partaker of the benefit of his celeſtial bed: and ſecondly, becauſe hee vouchſafed to take fleſh, and put on mans nature vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, that he might be our naturall brother.

which the church ſhal be quite &amp; cleane freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when mortifying the old man, ſhe runneth vnto the tabernacle of the bodie by death.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18986:67"/>
purpoſes of Chriſt, and the faithfull are and appeare in the preſence of God, moſt white, moſt precious, and moſt acceptable. Iuorie is made of an Eliphants tooth, very hard, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry durable, or incorruptible, and the Saphire is a kinde of pretious ſtone, which ſhineth moſt brightly: and euen ſo the iudgements of Chriſt and his elect are moſt ſincere, firme, and incorruptible: and furthermore they are bright and Orient Saphirs, lightning the whole body of the Church with their good workes: ſo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men ſeeing them, may glorifie God, which is in heauen. <hi>His legges are as pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of marble: ſet vpon ſockets of fine gold: his countenance as Lebanon, excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as the Cedars.

Now all the ſtrength and nimbleneſſe of a man is in his legges: wherefore by the legges, wee may note the inuincible ſtrength and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Chriſt, which is able both to breake all his enemies in peeces, and preſerue his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants from all manner of euill: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may be well likened vnto pillars of marble, <hi>ſet vpon ſockets of fine gold,</hi> becauſe they are inuincible, and the ſtrength of them can not bee ouercome: for he came into the fleſh, and ouercame ſinne, death and hell it ſelfe; becauſe hee might ſubdue them vnto the faithfull, and ſtrengthen their fearefull

hearts. And hence it is, that you may read in the holie Scripture, that hee is called a rocke, becauſe of his exceeding great force and ſtrength, againſt the which nothing ſhalbe able to preuaile. Thus then the force of Chriſt conſiſteth in this, that he is a pillar of marble, which hath none like vnto him, or to be compared with him: and as many as beleeue in him, may truly bee ſayd to bee pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars alſo. So that as many as are ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and confirmed by him, may bee ſayd to be pillars of the Church. And now after all this, ſhee ſetteth foorth his beautie at large, which onely the beleeuers ſee, and are deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the beautie thereof: and yet they ſee no more then it pleaſeth him to reucale vnto them. And his countenance is likened vnto Lebanon, which is a moſt ſtately and pleaſant place, becauſe indeed all the beauty, and ſweete ſmell of Lebanon, that is to ſay, of the Church, which is myſtically to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by Lebanon, is hid in Chriſt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the trees of Lebanon, he is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the high, incorruptible, and odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Cedar: for looke howe much the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar doth paſſe all other trees in height, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo much and more doth he exceed and ſurpaſſe all others in the Church; becauſe hee is more high, more precious, and more odoriferous then any other, yea there is no good ſmell,

                     <hi>waxed proud, or tooke great glorie in them,</hi> and all this after a good and godly ſort, therefore the bridegrome willeth them to turne them away from him, not but that he was greatly pleaſed with them, for ſo wee muſt alwayes vnderſtand him, leaſt we miſtake him, and be deceiued our ſelues: for the meaning of the words is this, I am already delighted &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with thy eyes, that is to ſay, with the knowledge of the godly &amp; righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the ſpirit of God which fully reſteth in them, in ſo much that they do is it were kindle my loue towards thee, inflaming my zeale, &amp; increaſing the ioy which I conceiue by thee, ſo that I can hardly endure the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of my loue, it ſo burneth within me. The other words which folow are expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the aforenamed place and chapter. <hi>There are</hi> 60. <hi>Queenes and</hi> 80. <hi>concubines, and of the damſels without number.</hi> The Church of God is one Church in the true vnitie of the ſpirit, this Church hath two mothers, one a fleſhly mother, and the other a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall mother, of the firſt wee haue intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alreadie in the third chap. of the ſecond, that is to ſay, of the ſpirituall mother, are theſe wordes ſpoken here in this verſe: for out of doubt theſe words are not intended of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18986:72"/>
the carnall Church, and therefore they muſt needs be meant of that Church which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the ſpirit. The Bridegrome calleth this Church a doue, that is to ſay, ſpirituall: and hee addeth moreouer, <hi>his doue,</hi> becauſe it is by means of his ſpirit, that ſhe is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: for without it ſhe could not bee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a doue. Furthermore, we may, for ought that I know, take this mother for the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating grace of God, which electeth the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſuſtaineth and vpholdeth the elect: &amp; this is commended of the Queens, concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, and yong damſels: by whom we are to vnderſtand the faithfull, becauſe they are made of a wicked and incredulous generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Church and congregation of the elect, which is continually reuiled, blaſphemed, &amp; contradicted Furthermore, theſe concubines and Queenes are the kings wiues, becauſe it is no ſtrange phraſe in the ſcripture, to call the concubines by the name of wiues: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be euident out of the olde teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the chiefe of them were called wiues, and the reſt concubines: as it is manifeſt by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> wiues. Thus the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered together, is one perfect ſpouſe of Chriſt, called a doue, becauſe of the gifts of the holie Ghoſt, which are contained in her: and the more ſpeciall, particular, and greater Churches are called Queenes, the leſſer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18986:72"/>
becauſe although they be threeſcore in number, that is enough, yet theſe are four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, that is more, for indeed the leſſer Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are more in number then the greater, the young damſels are the faithfull ſoules without number, becauſe there are many which are vnknowne to vs.</p>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18986:77"/>
And the Church of God, the true ſpouſe of God is ſhe which doth truely preach theſe good tydings, becauſe ſhe alone declareth vnto vs the worde of God, whereunto we muſt leane, <hi>and theſe goings</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>beautifull with ſhoes,</hi> which words are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by way of ſimilitude, to ſhew &amp; inſtruct vs, that as thoſe which will go any farre ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney muſt be well ſhod: ſo the profeſſors and miniſters of the Goſpell, which are to go a farre iorney to preach the Goſpell through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world, muſt be moſt readie to declare the truth vnto all men; and verily they may be then ſaid to be readie, and neuer before, when they do teach his word faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and ſincerely. So then beautifull are the goings of the. Church with ſhoes, becauſe when ſhe is ſent of God, ſhe is moſt willing and ready to declare vnto all men the words of ſaluation, and thus you may ſee, how Chriſt commendeth his owne good gifts in the Church, and that before the young vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, to wit, the ſoules of the faithfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would haue vs all to knowe, what manner of thing the Church is, and I doubt not, but that it ſo commeth to paſſe by the ſingular prouidence and wiſedome of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there are ſo many places in this book of the Canticles, where the Church commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Chriſt, and is againe commended of

him, becauſe we ſhould know what a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie point of doctrine this is to be repeated, and ingeminated in the eares of the faithfull, ſeeing that the ignorance and want thereof, hath almoſt ſeduced and beguiled the whole world.

                  <p>The necke is faith, as it is euident out of the firſt and fourth Chapters, and this place may be thus expounded, as if a man had a towre of iuorie, doubtleſſe it would be a very precious and ſtrong place: ſo in like maner, if a man haue faith, hee hath a moſt firme, ſtrong and precious towre and rocke of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, againſt which the gates of hell ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to preuaile: but of this there hath bene ſufficiently ſpoken in the places aboue mentioned. Moreouer, he commendeth her for her fine eyes, which ſignifie nothing elſe but the iudgementes of the Church, which are as cleare, bright, and pure, as the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And theſe fiſh-pooles <hi>are neare vnto the gate of Beth-rabbim,</hi> that is, if a man interpret it, the gate of the daughter of a multitude, that is, wherein manie are contained, or to whom manie belong, according to the phraſe and manner of ſpeaking of the Hebrewes, is the Church, which may bee verie fitly called, a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18986:80"/>
daughter of multitudes begotten by the word of God, whoſe gate is Chriſt. In this gate is their great aboundance and plentie of fountaines &amp; fiſhpooles of liuing water, that is to ſay, of truth, grace, and Gods diuine iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Furthermore, he goeth onward in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her for her noſe, which is a ſignification of vertue; for thereby do we ſmell the ſweete ſauours of our Lord and ſauior Ieſus Chriſt: wherefore, as they which are ſituated vpon the top of a towre on the pleaſant hill of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon,</hi> do partake the ſweet ſent of the ſpices which growe thereon; ſo hee that ſtandeth vpon the ſtrong tower of the Church, and hath ſure footing on this rocke, to wit, of faith, which is noted by the ſimilitude of a rock or towre muſt needs be perfumed with the ſweete ſmell of Chriſtes ointments: for becauſe he is in the Church, and the reſt not ſo for the ſame reaſon: and he ſaith, that this tower of faith <hi>looketh toward Damaſcus.</hi> Where he taketh <hi>Damaſcus</hi> for all the carnall minded men, which are indeed nothing elſe but a ſacke of bloud: becauſe this is the right ſignification of the word in the originall. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe doth the ſtrong tower, that is to ſay, the faith of the Church, looke moſt oppoſitely and directly, becauſe the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and affections of the Church are cleane contrarie vnto them: and the heade
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18986:80"/>
of the Church, as wee haue before prooued vnto you, is the Bridegrome Chriſt: a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and worthy Bridegrome, high as mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> and fruitfull as mount <hi>Carmel</hi>: for all theſe thinges haue bene truly ſpoken, and may bee very well verified of Chriſt, the head of the Church, for hee is moſt high and ſtatelie, fruitfull, and abounding in the corne of trueth, or rather all manner of fruites ſpring from him, and without him it is not poſſible for anie man to budde, or bring foorth either fruite or leaues. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, wee are ſed with his corne, that is to ſay, with his Spirit and truth, as often as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, as it is in the ſixt chapter of <hi>Iohn</hi> and 32. verſe, where hee commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Iewes to eate and drinke him by faith. And Chriſt here, as in manie other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Canticles, commendeth himſelfe in the Church, and the Church in him: for when hee praiſeth the head of the Spouſe, what doth hee elſe but commend himſelfe? by and by afterwardes he commendeth the Spouſe in commending himſelfe: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Spouſe deſerueth no commendari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, vnleſſe it be for his ſake. He proceedeth further yet to magnifie and extoll her haire: now the haire is nothing els but the doctrine and deedes of Chriſt, and the king which he talketh of is God, the purple the holie
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18986:81"/>
Ghoſt, and perfect charitie, the watering places, the writings of God &amp; the Prophets, where all the flockes of the Chriſtians are to be watered. And the haire of Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and likened vnto the purple of ſome mightie Prince, becauſe all that which hee either did or taught, was deriued from the ſource of the holy Ghoſt, and fountaine of true charitie, and the <hi>king is tyed to the wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring places,</hi> becauſe Gods holy ſpirit is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and ingrafted within the writings of the holy ſcripture, and bookes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, where he is alwayes preſent, and by them he maketh knowne the loue of God vnto the godly mindes: moreouer he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth to prayſe the Church, by rehearſing the generall commendations thereof, and confounding or huddeling the prayſes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, together into one ſhort ſentence, ſaying, <hi>ô faire art thou.</hi> O thou Church and congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the faithfull, which art moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and pleaſurable vnto thy ſpouſe, and that in the pleaſures of thy Chriſt, whileſt thou reioyceſt in him alone, and none but him, for otherwiſe thou ſholdeſt be the moſt miſerable &amp; diſtreſſed wretch in the world, receiuing no helpe and ſuccour from him, for no man that walketh in ſtrange plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures from Chriſt, can haue any comelineſſe or beauty before the Lord. Again ſhe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18986:81"/>
for her husband, and for her ſtature, in theſe words: <hi>This thy ſtature is like a palme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tree, and thy breasts like cluſters.</hi> The palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree is a tree that hath a ſound trunke, high and ſtraight; but the barke or rinde thereof is rugged, hard, and deformed, being broad and equallie big at top, bowing her head eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie way downward, which yeeldeth plentie of a kind of ſweet fruite called dates, which growe ſo plentifully vpon this tree, that they be like vnto the cluſters of vines: and this is the ſtature of Chriſtes ſpouſe: for ſhee is ſound becauſe of the roote and ſtrength of faith: ſomewhat high and tall, which is ſo ſtreight in the toppe with faith, and the conſideration of heauenlie thinges: that ſhe boweth or ſwaggereth not at all, neither to the right hande, nor to the left from the word of God: ſhee hath a hard, rough, and filthie barke, becauſe ſhee is yet a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hauing not crucified the olde man, but being alwayes ſubiect vnto aduerſities, ſtormes and troubles: aboue on the toppe of the tree, that is to ſay, in Chriſt the head of the Church there bee manie fine heights and breadthes, and workes of charitie ſtooping euerie way vnto the neceſſities &amp; infirmities of her neighbours and brethren: here are to be gathered moſt ſweet and pleaſant fruits,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18986:82"/>
becauſe there is nothing more pleaſant and ſweete then the loue of the Church, and as it is ſaid, the Church is the palmetree, which our ſauiour Chriſt went vp into, when hee powred downe his heauenly graces from heauen. Againe, hee went vp this palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, when more particularlie hee reuealed vnto his faithfull the knowledge of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. <hi>And hee tooke hold of the boughs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> that by touching of him, he might giue them ſome influence, and cauſe them more and more for to proſper and encreaſe. The breaſts of the Church are compared &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto <hi>the cluſters of the vine</hi>: becauſe as there are many ſtones in a cluſter of grapes, ſo true and perfect charitie is not idle, but bringeth foorth many godly workes. The laſt commmendation which hee giueth of the ſpouſe, is of the roofe of her mouth, which is the taſte and feeling of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, which is like the beſt wine, becauſe it is moſt pleaſant in taſte, comfortable to the mind, and without any mixtion or infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of anie ſtrange liquor, maketh a man drunken after a moſt profitable and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome kinde of ſort.</p>

altogether by the rule and canon of Gods holy word, which is moſt pure and vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which order muſt neceſſarily be kept of all thoſe which meane to attaine vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Their new wine,</hi> is the delectation and ſweetneſſe of Gods ſpirit, whereby they liue and walke, and haue their being, and the bridegrome may be very well ſaid to drinke of this wine, becauſe he is greatly delighted therewithall, for he may be ſaid in ſome ſort to drinke which findeth a thing which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him greatly.

vs inwardly by mouing of our harts to heare the word, and afterwards by confirming &amp; ſtrengthening the ſame in our minds, when we haue heard it. The Church (as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto you before) brought Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her mother, and he conuerted her becauſe Chriſt can not be truely and properly ſaide to be brought to a place, vnleſſe he be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and lodged there.

And verily ſuch was the heate of this loue, that many violent ſtreames of inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, troubles, reproches, tribulations, and all ſorts of euils that could be deuiſed, could not quench it: for by the parable of a houſe built vppon a ſure rocke, mentioned in the ſixt Chapter of Saint Lukes Goſpell, it is euident that flouds do ſometimes ſignifie aduerſitie. Now the loue which by the vertue of the ſame ſpirit abideth in the elect, is firme and ſtrong vnto them, in as much as they are built vpon the moſt ſure and ſtrong rocke Chriſt.

great efficacy of this moſt ſacred &amp; holy loue in all thoſe which are truely poſſeſſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: for it is the nature of true and perfect loue which commeth from the holy Ghoſt, to cauſe a man to renounce all that euer hee hath, and to order him ſelfe wholly after Gods will and commaundement. When ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are offered them, they regard or eſteeme them not: for wee ſee by daily experience, that they are ready and willing to forſake all that euer they haue if occaſion ſerue, &amp; time ſo require, rather then they will ſeeme to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the truth.
