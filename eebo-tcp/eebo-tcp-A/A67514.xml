            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </l>
            <l>Good Sir, says he, I'm come to tell you,</l>
            <l>Of an Estate of late befell you;</l>
            <l>Your Grand-mother is, Sir, Departed;</l>
            <l>Pleas'd with the News, then up I started:</l>
            <l>And is my Granny Dead? quoth I;</l>
            <l>He answer'd me, Yea, verily;</l>
            <l>Thou may'st believe me without Swearing,</l>
            <l>She is as dead as any Herring:</l>
            <l>Well, if the News be true, said I,</l>
            <l>Excuse me that I do not Cry,</l>
            <l>Since 'tis appointed all must Dye;</l>
            <l>For Grief, you know, will neither save,</l>
            <l>Or call Relations from the Grave.</l>
            <l>I lugg'd on Hose, and fell to dressing,</l>
            <l>Few Tears let fall, small Grief expressing;</l>
            <l>From thence we'djourned to the Ale-House,</l>
            <l>Where Credit seldom us'd to fail us,</l>
            <l>And there I made the Bumpkin Fuddle,</l>
            <l>Till Muddy Ale had seiz'd his Noddle,</l>
            <l>And then was forc'd to call two Porters,</l>
            <l>To lead the Lubber to his Quarters,</l>
            <l>My Landlord, as I pass'd the Bar,</l>
            <l>Gry'd out, <hi>Who pays the Reckoning here?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:35329:5"/>Said I, pray take it not amiss,</l>
            <l>Remember I must pay you this:</l>
            <l>Said he, pray, to prevent mistakes,</l>
            <l>Will you remember what this makes;</l>
            <l>Landlord, let no Ill Thoughts be harbour'd,</l>
            <l>I'll soon be rubb'd from off your Bar-board;</l>
            <l>I'll pay you in a little time;</l>
            <l>I doubt, says he, 'twill be in Rhime,</l>
            <l>For whatsoe' re we Trust a Poet,</l>
            <l>Our Bar for seven years may show it;</l>
            <l>And then if Dunn'd, all that they say to't,</l>
            <l>Poh, that Debt's Cancell'd by the Statute.</l>
            <l>From thence I went to th' <hi>City Crest,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In <hi>Pasty-Nook,</hi> to hire a Beast,</l>
            <l>Where one I got on Reputation,</l>
            <l>To prevent tedious Ambulation;</l>
            <l>Girt with a Sword, which in old Wars,</l>
            <l>Made many Bloody Wounds and Scars,</l>
            <l>Whose Blade was so experiencive,</l>
            <l>Of't self it knew to be defensive:</l>
            <l>A pair of Boots then on I Garters,</l>

            </l>
            <l>With Spurs, whose inlaid Gallantry</l>
            <l>Were Types of great Antiquity:</l>
            <l>Thus mounted I my Noble Steed,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35329:5"/>But by the way, my Muse intent is,</l>
            <l>To Sing my Horse's Excellencies;</l>
            <l>A short Encomium on his Paces,</l>
            <l>With all his Comely Looks and Graces.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Don Quixot</hi>'s Steed ne'er mov'd so nimble,</l>
            <l>When he advanc'd against the Windmill;</l>
            <l>And as for Shape, mine far surpasses</l>
            <l>The Courser of Sir <hi>Hugh de Brasses;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He was, if I am not mistaken,</l>
            <l>As fat as any Hock of Bacon;</l>
            <l>He'd all his Ribs, I'll boldly Swear on't,</l>
            <l>I told them, they were so apparent;</l>
            <l>No Curb he needed, whose will ride him,</l>
            <l>Instead of that, a Thread would guide him;</l>
            <l>For thus much in his Praise I'll say,</l>
            <l>I never knew him run away;</l>
            <l>Three Legs he'd Gallop, like a Racer,</l>
            <l>But still the fourth would be a Pacer;</l>
            <l>Yet when he Pac'd, as sure as could be,</l>
            <l>That self same Leg a Trotter would be;</l>
            <l>What Pace so e'er he'd into enter,</l>
            <l>One Foot would still be a Dissenter,</l>
            <l>Which makes me apt to think, Plague Rot him,</l>
            <l>Some <hi>Presbyterian</hi>'s Cart-Horse got him;</l>
            <l>With Whip and Spur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he might be beat up</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:35329:6"/>But then on's Knees, he was so humble,</l>
            <l>Each other step would be a Stumble;</l>
            <l>Then would I Spur, Whip, Curse, and Mumble,</l>
            <l>And he, poor Jade, so Groan and Grumble,</l>
            <l>That 'twould have made you laugh to've seen us,</l>
            <l>Such work sometimes there was between us:</l>
            <l>He ne'er would Sweat, or Tired be,</l>
            <l>Confound him, but he Tired me;</l>
            <l>Hail, Rain, or Shine, he'd in all Weather,</l>
            <l>Trot, Stumble, Gallop, altogether;</l>
            <l>So fierce he'd look, when he was Prancing,</l>
            <l>With Pendant Ears, and Tail advancing,</l>
            <l>And through both thick and thin would trudge it,</l>
            <l>As fast as Ass with Tinkers Budget;</l>
            <l>He'd rarely serve some Country Parson,</l>
