         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF Custom had not made it
common to prefix Epistles
to Books, I had freely
permitted thee to read the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Discourse without the
trouble of a preliminary Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
but the truth is, I like
not to be either Singular or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil:</p>
            <p>And yet, I confess I have
but very little to acquaint thee
with: for as I intend not to
court your kind acceptance of
the following Discourse, so
<pb facs="tcp:99318:3"/>
neither do I designe to disparage
it, or discourage thee from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusing
it.</p>
            <p>Only if I can prevail, I
heartily wish thou wouldest read
without prejudice, and with
that Candor that becomes an
impartial and discreet Reader:
and then, either give, or deny
it entertainment as you think fit;
for I assure thee The Author
desires to impose nothing upon
thy faith, but what is able to
abide the test. If he has erred,
he is only ambitious to have no
followers.</p>
            <p>When I gave way to the
publishing of the former Discourse,
I expected not to have met with
so many Enemies. But I see
the old saying holds good, <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas
<pb facs="tcp:99318:3"/>
odium parit.</hi> As for
those severe censures some men
have urged, I have endeavoured
to remove them in the following
Discourse, especially in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</hi>
For personal reflections
(the only weapons others have
made use of; although they be
as Ignorant who I am, as I
desire they should be,) these
I may very rationally contemn,
without the fear of censure from
the strictest <hi>Zoilus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess next to no adversary,
a fair and ingenuous one is the
most desirable; but whether it
has been my Good fortune (or
if you please to say Fate) to be
blessed with such, after thou
hast perused both what they and
I say thou wilt be able to
judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99318:4"/>
And upon this account (though
not only) I heartily wish thou
wouldest be pleased to compare
the <hi>Reply</hi> and <hi>Answer,</hi> and
both with the <hi>First Discourse,</hi>
which accidentally (I assure thee
not designedly) gave birth to
them; in doing of which if
thou reapest no advantage thy
self, yet I am sure thou shalt
oblige the <hi>Booksellers</hi> to give
thee thanks.</p>

            <head>A
DEFENCE
OF THE
BOOK,
ENTITULED,
A Discourse concerning the Period
of HUMANE LIFE.</head>
            <p>THere never was any
age in which the itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
humour of writing
many Books was more
truly visible, than in the present:
we may now with the Poet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate,
that, <hi>Scribimus indocti
doctique,</hi> every man thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
fit enough to spin out a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99318:5"/>
discourse for the Press; hence is
it, that the World is even ready
to complain of the Burden. I
know it is usual to pretend the
importunity of necessity, a very
fair and specious pretext, but I
much doubt, if it be always real
and true.</p>
            <p>BUT least I seem accessary to
the fault I so much condemn, I
here enter my solemn protest;
that as it was no piece of vanity
that engaged me to write the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
discourse, so neither am I
now acted by that principle to
defend it: If it had been any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
motive that did first ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
me, I should now have appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Sackcloth, with a free and
ingenuous confession of the crime.</p>
            <p>BUT having in the Preface to
that discourse already satisfied the
World concerning the design,
both of the Author, and of the
Book: I shall now forbear to give
a more tedious account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99318:5"/>
AND because I promised if the
judicious should dislike any thing
in the Book, either to satisfie them,
or yield to the force of their clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
discoveries: I am now come
to tell them, that I will keep my
promise; and stand to that engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>MUCH has been said in private
Cabals against both Author and
Book: that the Author is an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian,</hi>
is but a modest censure,
which I assure them does not in
the least offend me. As for their
more severe thundrings, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the Book to the flames,
and the Author to the Pillory;
it is good their power is not able
to effect what they please. I see
if they cannot answer the Book,
they are resolved to make both it
and the Author odious enough.
But all the slanders that malice
can invent, shall never discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
me from defence of the
Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99318:6"/>
IF the great Captain of our
Salvation was said to be a <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
and to have a Devil: It is but
a small matter that I should meet
with disingenuous men, who yet
brand me with more gentile
crimes. If my own familiar
friends should carry themselves
demurely towards me, this is no
harder measure than what better
men than I have experienced. It
is an old, but true saying, <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
odium parit.</hi> The great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of the Gentiles did find it so,
<hi>Am I become your Enemy because I
tell you the truth?</hi> And since this
is also my lot, I shall bear those
various censures very patiently,
not intending to render reviling
for reviling, but Blessing for
Cursing: <hi>Lord, forgive them, for
they know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT that I may not be further
tedious, I shall pass by all private
censures, and now only consider
an Answer, which was sent me
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99318:6"/>
by the Gentleman who published
my former Books, with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Letter.</p>
            <div type="letter">
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>BEing informed that there was
an Answer to your late <hi>discourse
concerning the Period of Humane
Life,</hi> intended for the Press; I ceased
not 'till I had spoke with the person
that had it: And although I had but
small acquaintance with him, yet his
ingenuity was such, that I obtained
a sight of it; but finding it so long
that I could not then peruse it, I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desired to know if he had the
confidence to trust me with it; freely
adding, that I knew how to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
it to you (not telling who you
were,) at first he seemed to refuse,
but after I had shewed him the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness
of my desire, he condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<hi>Sir,</hi> The Answer is thought to
be no ways despicable; therefore if
your affairs of greater concern can
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99318:7"/>
allow, I assure you your speedy answer
to; and return of these Papers, will
be very acceptable to;</p>

                  <p>I have here set down this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that men may know by
what means I obtained a sight of
the answer before it was Printed.</p>

            <div type="reply">

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>SOME few days ago I received
yours, with the bundle of
Paper. I heartily thank you for
the pains you have taken in that
particular. I have now perused
those Papers, which I find are
bespattered with very much Gall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99318:7"/>
and bitterness; it is a severe chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
<hi>that I have fallen upon very
bad principles, and maintain a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
contrary both to the Doctrin of
our Church, and of all sober and
Orthodox Divines.</hi> If this were
true as it is false, the Author might
be excused for his over much zeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but since the censure is altogether
void of truth, he must pardon
me to say, that the calumny is
inexcusable: but I love not to fling
Dirt upon those, who take the
liberty to bespatter me with it; it
were easie to recriminate, but our
great Master never taught any
such lesson.</p>
               <p>BUT as I do not know of what
Church the Author is a Member,
(for it may be, I oppose, that
Doctrin that is hotly taught in
some particular Churches) so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I know what Divines may
be Orthodox in his account: Sure
I am, that both the best and most
learned Writers of this and former
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99318:8"/>
ages, have maintained the senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I have embraced.</p>
               <p>WHETHER the Authors opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
or mine does best <hi>agree with
the humours of bad men,</hi> needs but
very little judgment to determin.
Pray, how can it gratifie any wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man to tell him, that he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
his days (a thing the most
vitious and aptest to wish) if he
would obey the Laws of Heaven?
And upon the other hand, that
his days shall be shortened (a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and unpleasant message to bad
men, who have no other heaven
but what they enjoy upon Earth)
if he continues in his wickedness?
Methinks this principle is so far
from encouraging men to sin, that
it quite opposeth it; affording
men most excellent encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to promote piety, and to
shun all manner of vices, <hi>which
lead down to the Chambers of
Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT if we now enquire how
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99318:8"/>
the Doctrin of absolute and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible
decrees do encourage men
to be holy, we shall weary our
selves e're we find one reason to
prove it. There can be no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
more pleasing to bad men,
for indeed hereby they labour to
excuse themselves, telling us, that
God has from Eternity absolutely
determined every thing they
should do, and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help it. O how luscious is
the high relish of this Doctrin to
bad men!</p>
               <p>FROM all this it may appear,
that the Gentleman might have
very well spared that Pathetick
Query. <hi>Shall we let it abroad to infect
men, without ever discovering the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of it?</hi> No sure Sir, that were a
great fault; pray involve not your
self (by a sinful silence) in so much
guilt: But alas! if I should put
the Author to tell me wherein lies
the danger, I could hazard ten to
one that he should be puzled to tell.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99318:9"/>
But this must pass for current
Coin, and be as strongly believed,
as if it were proved by ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Mathematical</hi> Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
else we will be called credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and not having so much
Faith, as a Grain of Mustard-Seed.</p>
               <p>I CONFESS the Author pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to be very unwilling, <hi>to engage
in the nice speculations of controversial
Divinity;</hi> but yet it seems he is of
so good and condescending a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that he cannot resist the
great importunity of a noble
Friend; he will rather hazard
one single look into <hi>things that</hi> (as
he says) <hi>are hid,</hi> than disoblige
his Friend, or (and indeed this is
a strong reason) suffer the <hi>good
cause</hi> to be ruined by his silence.
And thus we see that by his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
condescension, he luckily
bestows a couple of favours, one
upon his friend, and the other
upon truth. Sure never was there
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99318:9"/>
any man more fortunately happy;
but I forgot it was his fate to do
so, and no thanks to him for all
this.</p>
               <p>THE Gentleman needed not, I
think, have troubled himself much
with the state of the controversie,
since I had done it plainly enough;
and I leave you to guess if the
Author has done it more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>BUT passing lesser circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
I come now to examin the
Arguments he brings, to prove,
<hi>that the Period of every man's life
is unalterably fix'd by the Divine
Decree:</hi> this is the grand point he
maintains; a Doctrine long since
introduced by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and of
a later date, espoused by <hi>Mahomet</hi>
and his followers.</p>
               <p>AND yet if we will believe the
Author, this Doctrin is every
whit consonant to Scripture, and
undoubtedly proved by reason:
Well then, let us follow the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99318:10"/>
in his search, and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such an uncouth notion has a
favourable aspect from either of the
two.</p>
               <p>AS for Scripture, 1. he tells
us, <hi>there are many plain Texts
which do upon that account, express a
kind of propriety, that men may
claim in this last Period.</hi> O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
subtle disputer! I know no
man could argue so profoundly if
not a Disciple of <hi>Voetius:</hi> but let
us consider the Texts of Scripture
he brings to prove this; the first
is <hi>Eccl. 9. 12. Man also knoweth
not his time.</hi> Now the Author
makes this to be the import of
the words: <hi>The Period</hi> (says he)
<hi>of man's life is fixed by one absolute
Decree, and therefore he may call it</hi>
[his time.] This is indeed a very
ingenious Comment, only it is
faulty in that it is singular; for I
dare promise, few men ever
thought this was the meaning of
the Text: If I had been in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99318:10"/>
Pulpit I had readily raised this
Doctrin; <hi>that the time of our Dying
is very uncertain,</hi> and I had proved
it by <hi>Solomon</hi>'s words, <hi>man also
knoweth not his time. Another</hi>
Text he brings, is <hi>Psal. 39. 5.
Lord, make me to know mine end,
and the measure of my days.</hi> But
I remember I have already shewed
how strangely this Text is brought
to confirm a Doctrin it is utterly
unacquainted with; see <hi>The Period
of Humane Life, pag. 109. Edit.</hi> 1.
by this brief reply the Author
may easily guess what strength is
in these or the like Phrases to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
his opinion.</p>
               <p>THE next argument he urgeth
is every whit as impertinent; for
it is an old and true saying, <hi>Omnis
similitudo claudicat:</hi> this the Author
seems to smell; but he pretends
that he is so wise, as to press them
no farther than the scope of the
comparisons lead him; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be so or not, I shall briefly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99318:11"/>
examin. First, <hi>Scripture</hi> (he says)
<hi>frequently compares the life of man
to the Grass; the flourishing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying
of which, is fixed and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
Answ.</hi> It will trouble
the Author to prove, that all
Grass doth flourish in the Morning,
and decays in the Evening. But
I shall grant that there are some
Flowers that do; yet this can
never prove that the Period of
Humane Life is fatally determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
If I remember well, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators
say, such similitudes
are made use of to denote the
brevity of man's life. I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
but one sacred Text, to
prove this is the import of the
similitude; the place is <hi>Iob 14.
1, 2. Man that is born of a
Woman, is of few days and full of
trouble, he cometh forth as a Flower,
and is cut down. Secondly,</hi> He
tells us, that <hi>the life of man is
compared to a Race,</hi> Heb. 12. 1.
<hi>Answ.</hi> It is so, and that very
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99318:11"/>
aptly; but not because the bounds
are unalterably fixed, but because
of the noble price that is appointed
for those who obey the Divine
Precepts, and who do not faint
in well doing; and the only intent
of the comparison is, that if we
expect that Heavenly reward, we
must persevere in well doing; as
those who run in a Race do not
faint and give over, if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to obtain the price. <hi>Thirdly,
The life of man</hi> (says he) <hi>is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to a shadow. Answ.</hi> I know
it is, but sure not because it hath
determined limits, but because of
its duration; for as a shadow
quickly passeth away, so the days
of man are but few. Hence <hi>Iob</hi>
tells us, <hi>He fleeth as a shadow. cap. 14.
2.</hi> and the Psalmist speaking of
himself says, <hi>I am gone like a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
when it declineth.</hi> But I have
insisted too long in answering such
trivial arguments. I will now
view if the plain (as he calls
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99318:12"/>
them, implying that the former
were not) Texts of Scripture he
brings, be urged to any better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>THE first plain Text is <hi>Iob 14.
5. Seeing his days are determined,</hi>
&amp;c. this is indeed the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
place of Scripture we
have seemingly standing against
us; but in my former discourse I
have fully shewn, that it does no
way contradict any position I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.
I shall therefore now only
consider what he urges against
what I there replied, and judge
you which of us does suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I cannot</hi> (says he) <hi>but admire
the Author's impudence in making
this Text the Basis of his discourse.</hi>
Good Sir, is this the effect of a
mild and gentle Spirit? but i'll
pardon this, since may be it is
the result of your holy zeal; but
if you be not resolved to be an
admirer, I will endeavour to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99318:12"/>
cure that distemper. The reason
then why I made choice of that
Text was, because I judged it the
main place urged in defence of the
opinion you maintain; and if this
were well cleared and duly explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and made to make nothing
for you, I easily foresaw how little
difficulty there would be in answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
other Texts.</p>
               <p>LET us now view how artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
he draws <hi>Iob</hi>'s words in a
Syllogystick fear, <hi>If God</hi> (says he)
<hi>has so determined man's days, that
he cannot pass those prefixed bounds,
then the Period of Humane Life is
not mutable; but the first is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable.</hi>
Ergo. <hi>Answ.</hi> If the
Author had but remembred how
he had stated the case, he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made use of this argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for he grants, that both he and I
may maintain, that the Period of
Humane Life is both mutable and
immutable. I did not deny but
our days are determined, see <hi>pag.</hi> 81.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99318:13"/>
and the Author must know, that
all the debate is concerning the
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (says the Author) <hi>I am
heartily glad that he acknowledgeth
the infinity of the Divine knowledge.</hi>
When I first did read this, I
thought the Author had forgot
himself, for he is but seldom in so
good an humour; but when I
again viewed what follows, I saw
all was spoken <hi>Ironice;</hi> which
will make me ever afterwards
suspect his Complements: And
if he kiss again, I shall be upon
my Guard that he do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray.</p>
               <p>HOW the Divine knowledge
is not conjectural, although it be
not founded on an absolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
has been briefly manifested
in the first Discourse. But because
I must follow the Author, I shall
forbear to speak of it here, because
it comes afterwards to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:99318:13"/>
A SECOND plain Text of
Scripture is <hi>Psal. 90. 3. Thou tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man to destruction, and sayest,
return ye Children of men.</hi> I am
the most deceived, if this Text
proves what it is brought for: Sure
the only intent of the Royal Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
here is to shew, that God
is the supream Lord and Master of
the Universe; who exerciseth an
uncontrolable Dominion, and
who can according to his pleasure
either shorten or prolong the
days of man; but there is not one
word here of any absolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
               <p>A THIRD plain Text equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to the former is <hi>Psal. 68.
20. Unto God the Lord belong the
passage to Death.</hi> Now let us hear
the Author's Comment, <hi>that is</hi>
(says he) <hi>the Period of every man's
life is in the hand of God.</hi> Now
this is indeed very well said; but
he sees better than his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
who says it is spoken to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99318:14"/>
the purpose. But further, what
if he and <hi>Voetius</hi> have given a bad
Translation of the Text, if I
might hazard to our <hi>English,</hi>
(which I think is one of the best
Translations) I dare say it is so;
for there we read, <hi>Unto God the
Lord belong the [issues from]
Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE last plain Text is <hi>Act.
17. 26. He hath determined the
bounds of our Habitation.</hi> Strange!
the Author can never find the
word <hi>determine,</hi> but he instantly
concludes, that we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
an absolute and irrespective
Decree. He knows well enough
that I grant that the Period of
Humane life is determined, why
then does he urge these Texts
against me?</p>
               <p>IN the next place, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
brings a great many instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to prove the Period of those
mens lives, who dye a casual and
violent Death, is fixed and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99318:14"/>
but he needed not to have
put himself to so much trouble,
since I never maintained, that the
World is left to its own casual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions.
If he had pleased, he
might have viewed <hi>pag.</hi> 76. where
he will find, I grant, <hi>that the
most seemingly usual periods of men,
are ordered by an infinite Wisdom,
and fall under the Divine Rule and
Dominion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NEITHER needs the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
redouble his <hi>NOW, NOW
we have the Author yielding;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I said, <hi>we never doubted,
but the great Governour of the
World may make what reserved cases
he pleases from the general Rule,
and the ordinary course of things,
pag.</hi> 111. This methinks is a
very plain Truth; but that I may
do all I can to satisfie the Author,
I shall add, that the reason why
some mens lives may be unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
determined, and yet the
Period of other mens may for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99318:15"/>
be left mutable, is, because
the supream Governour of the
World thinks fit it should be so.
If this will not suffice the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
let him choose as he thinks
best.</p>
               <p>BUT to proceed, <hi>since the
first step</hi> (says he) <hi>and moment of
our Beings is determined, it is but
reasonable to think that the last is
also fixed. Answ.</hi> It is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reasonable, only we must take
heed that we do not wrest Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
to patronize our own self-chosen
opinions: Now the Text
brought to prove that the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Being is determined,
is <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 16. which is a very
odd Paraphrase of the Author's,
for the Psalmist there is not spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Divine Decrees, but
of the infinity of the Divine
knowledge, which is a depth he
confesses he cannot Fathom. Now
that God doth know both the first
and last moments of our life, is a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99318:15"/>
Truth I am as ready to defend as
the Author.</p>
               <p>BUT I see the Author is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to dispute with me, as if
I were an enemy to a particular
Divine Providence; else to
what purpose does he bring his
following troop of Arguments?
As</p>
               <p>1. <hi>All the actions and works, all the
ways and steps of man, are ordered
by God. Answ.</hi> All this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
by me; if he urgeth them
against any other, let those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
make answer.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>All other animate Beings</hi> (says
he) <hi>are determined. Answ.</hi> To
what and how are they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
I know they have a Being, and
that they are all dependent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
But do you seriously think
that God from Eternity did by an
absolute Decree determin the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of every Creature? Can you
without a certain reluctancy say,
that the supream and adorable
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99318:16"/>
Being of whom we ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
noble and becoming
thoughts, did by an absolute
Decree determin the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Period of every Flea?
Pray consider, Sir, what you
say.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Inanimate Beings</hi> (says he) <hi>are
also limitted. Answ.</hi> When God first
Created the World, he put every
thing in a fit and convenient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and so exactly ordered every
piece of the Creation, that it
should be subservient to the whole.
Hence he set bounds to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and appointed the Sun,
Moon, and Stars, to be for Signs,
and for Seasons, and for Days,
and Years; and according to the
Primitive Precept, every thing
(Angels and Men excepted) stands
according as he ordered. But
yet these inanimate things are
not so fixed, as that upon extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
occasions he cannot alter
their course.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:99318:16"/>
4. <hi>Do we not</hi> (says he) <hi>read of
the determined Period of Kings and
Kingdoms? Answ.</hi> Undoubtedly
we do, but what then? Do you
imagin that God by an absolute
Decree did determin the Periods of
particular Kings and Kingdoms?
Pray consider what the Majesty
of Heaven hath said, 1 <hi>Kings 9.
4,</hi> 5, 6, &amp;c. <hi>If thou wilt keep my
Statutes and Iudgments, then I will
Establish the Throne of thy Kingdom
upon</hi> Israel <hi>for ever; but if you
will not keep my Commandments
and my Statutes, then will I cut off</hi>
Israel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Surely the most
High ruleth in the Kingdom of
men, he putteth down one,
and setteth up another, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as men obey his Statutes,
so he dispenseth his favours to
them.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>It is a dangerous thing</hi> (says
he) <hi>to grant, that the most incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
thing is exempted from the
Hand of Divine Providence. Answ.</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:99318:17"/>
I am very far from thinking, that
the Author is an Enemy to the
Divine Providence; but truly of
the two opinions, that which he
maintains seems to enervate it
more than mine; for if God has
from Eternity absolutely decreed
every thing, then a particular
providence whereby he superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
and governs all things, seems
not to have any place; but the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
I maintain puts all things in
the hands of God, who may do
in Heaven and in Earth as he
thinks fit. He may shorten or
prolong my life, he may do with
me as he pleaseth, for he is our
Maker, and we the work of his
own hands. This encourageth
me to wait and depend upon him,
because I know he is the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the World, and has so
absolute a Dominion, that none
can stay his hand, or say unto
him, what dost thou?</p>
               <p>HENCE not only those
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99318:17"/>
things which sustain and uphold
men in Being, but also the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of every man's life depends
upon God: As he may either
give or deny those necessary things,
so may he also shorten or prolong
our life. And thus there is no need
of running to the absolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>It is</hi> (says he) <hi>an old and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
Maxim of Philosophers,
cujusque contradictionis altera pars
determinatè vera est, altera falsa.
Answ.</hi> The Maxim is very true,
but not very pertinently applied.
For supposing there had never
been a World, and so no Decree
concerning any thing future; yet
this had been true, <hi>both parts of a
contradiction cannot be true.</hi> But
now if the Author means, that
the operations of free Agents are
all absolutely determined; this he
must prove by some other <hi>medium</hi>
than that Philosophick Maxim,
which only infers that one part
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99318:18"/>
of the contradiction is true, but
leaves us ignorant which of the
two.</p>
               <p>AFTER all this he comes at
length to Catechise me most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely.
<hi>Will ye</hi> (says he) <hi>have
your recourse to a Stoical fate, or
Turkish necessity?</hi> No, good Sir,
I assure you I will not, but I am
afraid some others may. <hi>Will ye
plead</hi> (says he) <hi>from the fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
concourse of Epicurean Atoms?
Or</hi>—Pray Sir hold, for it is
so long since I was last exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that I have almost forgot
the trick of answering. If I
should permit you to proceed, I
could only say <hi>No</hi> to all your
Questions; and I believe you
knew well enough that I was as
much an Enemy to all these as your
self.</p>
               <p>BUT I see what you have
yet said are but slender attempts,
and only in order to a more noble
and grand design. It is well
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99318:18"/>
your small Shot, discharged in
these light Skirmishes, have not
hurt us. Come let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and see the event of the
fight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If God</hi> (says he) <hi>has not by an
absolute Decree determined the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of every man's life; how can
the certainty of the Divine foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
be defended? Answ.</hi> Could
the Author be contented with it as
the Scriptures leave it, there need
be little debate in the case. The
Gentleman is pleased to say, that
I seem to be like a Ship tossed with
a great Storm; but he might have
more truly said, that I think that
it is a bold enquiry which concerns
not us to know, the depths of the
Divine Wisdom are too profound
for Mortals to measure; and since
Sacred Writ calls it a depth, I am
sure it is safest to break out into
that extasie of admiration with
the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 11. 33. O the
depth of the Riches, both of the Wisdom
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99318:19"/>
and Knowledge of God! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
are his Iudgments, and
his ways past finding out! For
who hath known the mind of the
Lord, or who hath been his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF God had ever designed that
we should know those secrets, he
had certainly disclosed them in
his revealed Word; but since
Scripture is silent, it is our Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to forbear a curious search
into things which he hath reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
within his own peculiar Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>BUT I see this will not serve
the Author's turn, he will have
the very manner of Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of future things determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and if I cannot tell, yet he
can unfold this Secret, by saying,
<hi>that God has from Eternity absolutely
Decreed every thing, therefore he
certainly knows every thing.</hi> And
now because this is the grand
Doctrin he always repeats, I shall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99318:19"/>
without being very tedious, first
shew him, that we have no ground
to believe that every future acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is absolutely decreed. And
secondly, I shall endeavour to
shew, that the Divine knowledge
is notwithstanding certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
               <p>1. WE have no ground to
believe, that every future action is
absolutely decreed, because God
does certainly know all sinful and
criminal actions, and yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rationally conclude that he has
absolutely decreed those actions,
for this doth neither agree with
the justice nor goodness of God.
Do you think that a just and good
God (who is the Judge of all the
Earth) would punish men with
everlasting Torments, if he had
by an absolute decree determined
that they should commit all these
Sins? Methinks if this were the
case of these miscreants, they
might reasonably excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99318:20"/>
before their Judge, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,
that they could not do
otherwise. But truly there is no
ground for this plea, for he hath
left men inexcusable, and doth
not tempt any man to Sin.</p>
               <p>BUT I remember the Author
distinguisheth between <hi>an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi>
and <hi>permissive decree. Answ.</hi>
I could never yet well understand
what they mean by a <hi>permissive
decree:</hi> If they say, God only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
Sin, they say right; but
from thence they can expect no
sanctuary, for this cannot accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to them be a ground to infer
any certain knowledge; for to
permit Sin, is in this case only a
not hindering of men in their
wicked courses and ways. If you
yet add, that in that permissive
decree, the will of man, with
all the circumstances of time and
place are included. I Answer,
that the decree is not then abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
but respective; since both
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99318:20"/>
persons and their qualifications
are considered: And I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
this is very agreable with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
phrases of Scripture, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
with that <hi>Rom. 8. 29. For
whom he did foreknow, them also he
did predestinate.</hi> So that if we
even run up to the knotty point of
predestination, we shall find that
the Decrees, both of election and
reprobation consider the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of persons, and that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
preceeds any Decree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and indeed this was the opinion of
all learned men before S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>'s
time. <hi>Scriptores veteres</hi> (saith
<hi>Melancthon,</hi> cited by <hi>Episcopius,</hi> in
his second Epistle to <hi>Bererovicius)
omnes preter unum</hi> Augustinum,
<hi>putarunt aliquam causam electionis
in nobis esse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. WE have clear evidences
from Scripture informing us, that
God did certainly know many
things which should have been
really future, if the conditions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99318:21"/>
upon which their futurition depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
had been placed. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ tells us, that if the
mighty works which were done
in <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> had
been done in <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> they
had repented. God knew that if
<hi>Cain</hi> had done well, he should
have been accepted. The whole
tenor of the Scriptures abounds
with many such like instances.
If <hi>Nineveh</hi> had not repented, God
knew that they should have been
destroyed. It is not absurd to
think that God would have
threatned to inflict that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he did not know; as
certainly he would not, if their
Doctrin concerning the absolute
Decrees be true. But I remember
I have in the former discourse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon this argument; I
shall therefore only now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what the Author answers
to the Texts of Scripture there
cited.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:99318:21"/>
THE first Text is 1 <hi>Sam. 23.
11,</hi> 12. which plainly shews,
that God did certainly know, that
if <hi>David</hi> had not departed from
<hi>Keilah,</hi> the <hi>Keilites</hi> had delivered
him into the hands of <hi>Saul.</hi> To
this he answers, <hi>That</hi> David <hi>was
not curiously inquisitive concerning
the Divine Will, for that was a
Secret<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reply.</hi> This is a strange
fancy, for is it not as certain as
any thing can be, that <hi>David</hi>
enquired of the Lord whether
<hi>Saul</hi> was come to <hi>Keilah,</hi> and if
the <hi>Keilites</hi> would deliver him up;
which <hi>David</hi> had not known
('till it may be, too late) if God
had not revealed both. But he
says, <hi>there was no prediction of
any thing which should be. Answ.</hi>
It's true, <hi>Saul</hi> did not come to
<hi>Keilah,</hi> but certainly he should
have come, if <hi>David</hi> had remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
And thus the prediction is
of what should have happened,
if <hi>David</hi> had not left <hi>Keilah.</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:99318:22"/>
And do you think that God would
have foretold any thing but what
he certainly knew? Again he
adds, <hi>that the prediction was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi>
David'<hi>s being delivered up,
but concerning the inclinations of the
people. Answ.</hi> The Text speaks
nothing of the inclinations of the
people, but of a thing future;
<hi>They will deliver you up, viz.</hi> if
you stay with them: and so
<hi>David</hi> does not inquire if <hi>Saul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to come up, neither does the
Answer he receives imply any such
thing.</p>
               <p>THE other Text is 2 <hi>King. 13.
19.</hi> where the Prophet is angry
with the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> for smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the ground but thrice;
telling him, that if he had smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
five or six times, he had
smitten <hi>Syria,</hi> till he had consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it. To this he answers, <hi>that
is is altogether groundless to imagin,
that God had decreed that</hi> Joash
<hi>should smite the Ground more that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99318:22"/>
thrice. Answ.</hi> We do not say
that God had absolutely decreed
how oft he should smite the
Ground. Scripture makes no
mention of any Decree, only
this he tells us, that if <hi>Ioash</hi> had
smitten five or six times, he had
totally subdued <hi>Syria.</hi> And truly,
since we find the Prophet angry
with him because he only smote
thrice; we may rationally suppose
that God had not absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
that he should smite no
oftner. To suppose that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
was general, is only a
may be; and we may more war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably
say, what if it was not
general?</p>
               <p>3. LET us now come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin
the dangerous effects of this
Doctrin of this absolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional
Decrees, and the bad
consequences which naturally
proceed from it. 1. I have
shewed that it destroys the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Humane nature. And
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99318:23"/>
2. That it makes all lawfull means
unnecessary; see <hi>the Period of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Life, pag.</hi> 103. 3. It leaves
no place for praise to the learned
Physician, nor for dispraise to the
unskillful Empyrick, <hi>pag.</hi> 105.
And 4. If this Doctrin be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
to the uttermost, it enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
men to expose themselves
like fools or mad men to any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>BUT 2. Although God has
not absolutely Decreed every fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
action, yet he hath an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
and certain cognisance of
every thing. For 1. That I may
argue (as they speak) <hi>ad hominem,</hi>
I hope the Author will not deny
that God knows every thing that
is possible, and yet no man ever
said, that God decrees what
things are possible, and what not.
God knew how to raise up Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
unto <hi>Abraham</hi> out of the
Stones, and yet I think there was
no Decree concerning this.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99318:23"/>
2. God knows whatsoever is true,
but all future actions are true;
if it be true that <hi>Titius</hi> died this
day, in such a place, and of such
a malady; this was from Eternity
true, that he should dye this day,
and in such a place. <hi>But ye say,</hi>
an action is not future, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is decreed. <hi>Answ.</hi> That
I may quickly dispatch this, I
shall now freely impart what has
fully for a long time satisfied
me.</p>
               <p>THE great and wise Creator,
out of his meer pleasure, freely
Created this World, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
it with varieties of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
of different natures;
amongst those, Man made after
the Image of his Maker, was
created a free Agent. Now
since the Eternal Wisdom thought
it expedient, that there should be
such a Creature as Man; we must
not take from him that free prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
bestowed upon him in his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99318:24"/>
Creation: And since it is the
good pleasure of Heaven, that
Man in all his actions should act
freely and without constraint,
what reason have we to think
that there is any absolute Decree
which is inconsistent with this
freedom? <hi>And thus,</hi> that there
ever was such a Creature as Man,
this is the meer result of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will; that Man acts freely
and without constraint, this is
also the effect of Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
and thus all things depend
upon the Divine Will. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Divine Knowledge is
infinite, he therefore knows every
thing that Man is to act; for
whatsoever he acts is true, and
so consequentially was from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
true. This methinks is
a plain and easie way, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
both the certainty of
the Divine Knowledge, and
the freedom of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:99318:24"/>
HAVING thus dispatched
these two things I proposed, I
now return to the Author; where
first we find him fighting lustily
with <hi>Molina</hi> and <hi>Fonseca,</hi> and
Cursing their Bastard (begotten,
he says, in the dark, pardon this
innocent piece of Drollery) <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia
media,</hi> with <hi>Iob</hi>'s imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH it be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
to discourse of this, yet
since the Author thinks he has
thereby ruined and undermined
all I have said, I shall follow the
Author, and briefly examin his
arguments he urges against this
Doctrin.</p>
               <p>THE first assault he makes,
is, <hi>That I have recourse to the</hi>
Jesuitical <hi>Port. Answ.</hi> He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
before compared me to a
Ship tossed with a great Storm,
it is no wonder though I be glad
to get to any safe Haven; if it
belongs to the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99318:25"/>
is not great, since the Port
is secure. And I am sure the
Author's Doctrin of <hi>Physical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination</hi>
is the invention
of the <hi>Dominicans; jam sumus ergo
pares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT are there no <hi>Protestant</hi>
Divines, who own and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that God knows that many
things should have been future,
if such and such conditions had
been placed? Does the Author
know, that <hi>Gomarus, Waleus,</hi>
and many other Foreign <hi>Theologs,</hi>
have recourse to <hi>Scientia media:</hi>
And at home, how many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Doctors do defend it? Nay
indeed your own D. <hi>Twiss,</hi> who
seems to be one of the greatest
Enemies to it, yet maintains a
notion every whit as unconcieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
(as you are pleased to call
this) his <hi>Decretum generale de
ciendis Creaturas agere, congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter
ipsarum naturis,</hi> is, may be,
not much different from this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:99318:25"/>
BUT if the opinion be true,
it matters not much who defends
it. Let us now hear what he
Objects. <hi>I shall</hi> (says he) <hi>only in
a word or two manifest the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieveableness
of this position. Answ.</hi>
I dare hazard for all this promise,
he shall have <hi>thirdly beloved,</hi> 'ere
he has done. His first word is,
<hi>Since antecedently to the Decree all
things are purely possible, how can
God know that such things are either
absolutely or conditionally future?
Answ.</hi> 1. I confess God always
knows things as they are, so that
if there be nothing future, he
could not know them to be fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
2. I grant that it is only
the result of the Divine Goodness,
that there was ever such a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as man. Yet 3. Since God
did make man a free Agent, and
gave him power to act without
constraint; not Physically prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
his Will, nor by any
absolute Decree fatally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99318:26"/>
his inclinations, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him no liberty for choice:
Hence it is, that all and every
act that man elicits, is certainly
fore-known, although not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
determined. For by vertue
of that Primitive Precept, men act
as freely, as rational Agents act ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily.</p>
               <p>AND thus that grand Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
does not militate against us.
For we grant that antecedently to
the Decree, Man, and all his
future actions were only possible;
but after Almighty God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
or purposed to make Man,
all his future actions, although
not absolutely determined, were
yet certainly known: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of both, is, because Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made a free Agent, there can
be no absolute Decree everting
and overthrowing his nature;
and since he was to elect such and
such actions, an infinite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
behoved to know them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:99318:26"/>
HIS second argument is, <hi>That
all knowledge depending upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is first suspended, and secondly
conjectural. Answ.</hi> We do not
say that Divine Knowledge does
depend upon conditions; all that
we claim, is, that God knows
that many things should have
been future, if the conditions
had been placed: And this we
judge is altogether agreable to
Sacred Writ. So that it is only
the futurition of things, and not
the Divine Knowledge, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon conditions.</p>
               <p>'TIS true, man being a free
Agent, he may either act or not
act, even then when all things
requisite for acting are placed:
but yet it must be granted, that
the Will cannot always hang in
an <hi>aequilibrio;</hi> since it is a self-determining
principle, it must
either will or <hi>nill</hi> the doing of
such a thing, and this an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
intellect doth certainly know.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:99318:27"/>
3. HE Objects, <hi>There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
conditionally future in respect
of God: For either the Condition is
to be placed, and so it becomes abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
future; or else it is never to
be placed, and so it is only possible.
Answ.</hi> I have frequently heard
this argument urged, as if it
were unanswerable; but I must
confess, if my judgment be any
ways regardable, it is the only
result of ignorance. For first,
those who urge it, seem to mistake
what is meant, when men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
betwixt things absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and conditionally future.
Things <hi>absolutely future,</hi> are those
things which do not depend upon
any condition: but things <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
future,</hi> are such things as
are really future, if the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be placed; and should not have
been future, if they had not been
placed.</p>
               <p>NOW although the condition
be not placed, yet they differ
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99318:27"/>
hugly from things which are
meerly possible; for the things
meerly possible, are not future
upon the placing of whatsoever
condition: but things conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
future, should have been
really future, if the conditions
had been placed.</p>
               <p>BUT the Author adds, <hi>That
all conditions are included in the
absolute Decree. Answ.</hi> If there
be any conditions included in the
Decree, it ceaseth to be absolute,
as every mans reason will easily
teach him.</p>
               <p>AFTER all this the Author
tells me, <hi>it is not in his power to
reconcile me with my self.</hi> Strange!
what an unknown quarrel is this?
alas! have I been so unwary as
to contradict what I had formerly
said; and is the Author willing,
but unable to take up the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence?
Since he pretends he is
not, I will essay what may be
done. First, <hi>We have no ground
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99318:28"/>
to think that God decrees every fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
action.</hi> And the reason I
said so, was, because there are
many sinful actions which the
Majesty of Heaven forbids, and
therefore does not absolutely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
them: And yet I grant, <hi>that
the most contingent actions depend
immediately upon the Divine Will:</hi>
Because the reason why Man was
made a free Agent, and acts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
constraint, is, because God
did Will both.</p>
               <p>AND thus I have examined
what the Author brings in defence
of his own opinion. I come
now to survey what he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to what I urge against it.
And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>I TOLD,</hi> That this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
is a good plea for wicked men.
<hi>To this he Answers,</hi> that in the
Schools they speak of a two-fold De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
the one effective, the other
permissive. Reply. <hi>I have already
discovered the insufficiency of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99318:28"/>
this Answer, and therefore shall
not repeat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I TOLD, <hi>That it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with the freedom of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature.</hi> In Answer to this,
he alledgeth, <hi>That the decree does
not hinder, but helps Men to act
freely. Reply.</hi> Let us examin if it
be so; you affirm that God has
by an absolute Decree, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Period of <hi>Titius</hi> his Life,
and that he has also as absolutely
decreed every thing that he shall
do; now I desire to know of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
who is a free Agent, that
can do any other thing but what
is decreed, or if he can do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise?
If you say he cannot,
then pray how is he left a free
agent, since he must do all that
is decreed, and can do no other
thing.</p>
               <p>BUT he says, <hi>All kinds of
necessity are not inconsistent with
liberty. Answ.</hi> What then, is
there no kind of necessity incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99318:29"/>
with it? And is not Man
become a necessary Agent, if he
cannot but act so and so? Is there
any resisting of the decree? But
he adds, <hi>We only plead for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of events. Answ.</hi>
The Will is then left free, and
God only determins the thing,
but not the Will. Pray how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
is this in this Authors own
judgment.</p>
               <p>3. I TOLD, <hi>That this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
leaves no place for praise to the
learned Physician, nor for dispraise
to the unskilful Empyrick.</hi> He
Answers, <hi>That the Physicians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
praise, because they act as
freely as if there were no Decree.
Reply.</hi> The Author had done well
if he had made this plain, for
that which he alledgeth is all
along denied by us; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
we gave, was, because if the
Physician does only prescribe those
Medicaments, he was absolutely
decreed to ordain; and if he can
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99318:29"/>
prescribe no other, then he deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
no praise, since he does
no more but what he could not but
do.</p>
               <p>4. I TOLD, <hi>That this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
by a genuine consequence indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
men to expose themselves to any
danger:</hi> For if the <hi>Terminus vitae
est immobilis;</hi> what need men
fear to run upon the mouth of
the roaring Cannon; if it be
their fate to dye, they cannot by
all their Art and Skill evite death;
if it be not fatally determined,
then let us face any danger, we
have good enough proof against
it. To this he answers, <hi>That it
is just like that argument which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
propounds to our Lord Christ,</hi>
Matth. 4. 6. <hi>Reply.</hi> I am not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising
any Man to cast himself
upon those dangers, only I tell
what is the consequence of this
Doctrin. Now our blessed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
is justly offended with Satan,
because of his malicious design in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99318:30"/>
urging that argument. But there
is no question but the argument
was strong, and this Christ does not
challenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (says he) <hi>we must not make
the secret determinations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Councel our rule. Reply.</hi> If
they be secret Councels, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make them our rule: But sure
they can no more be said to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
since so many Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to know, that God has
absolutely determined every
thing.</p>
               <p>I HAVE quickly dispatched
his Answers, because they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
slight and inconsiderable.
Now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let us hear how he vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
his opinion from that unjust
(as he calls it) imputation I have
cast upon it; namely, that I say,
<hi>it is only the opinion of the</hi> Stoicks,
<hi>dressed up in better apparel: The
word</hi> Fate <hi>is</hi> hateful (says he) <hi>in
the Christian Schools. Reply.</hi> May
be the Author will find himself
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99318:30"/>
to be in a mistake here: I shall
only recommend to him an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
with whom he seems to be
intimately enough acquainted;
and that is, <hi>Voetius de vitae ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino;</hi>
in Answer to Object. 6.
<hi>Apud Philosophos</hi> (says he) <hi>variae
occurrunt fati explicationes, quarum
aliquae à veritate &amp; pictate nihil
alienum sonant.—Nec desunt
inter antiquos et recentiores veri
Docti qui Stoicorum placitum in
dextram partem interpretentur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND indeed any man that
compares the two opinions, will
find them to be upon the matter
the same: the difference that the
Author gives betwixt the two,
is the very same that I mentioned
and told him of. But it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to insist here, for the thing
is palpable and cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>IN the last place the Author
comes to answer those arguments
I urged in defence of the <hi>mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:99318:31"/>
of the Period of Humane life.
<hi>My first argument was,</hi> upon the
observance of the Divine Laws,
there are many promises in Scripture
assuring us of length of days; and
on the other side, there are many
threatnings of cutting short the days
of the Wicked. <hi>In Answer to this,
the Author alledgeth many
things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. HE tells us, <hi>The words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
shorten,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>do not properly
signifie to make longer or shorter, but
only imply length or shortness of days.
Reply.</hi> I confess I do not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this distinction; but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the words were to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
as the Author takes them,
yet all we plead for stands firm:
for those that obey the Statutes
shall live long, which (with
the Author's leave) is the same
with having their days prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>In these promises</hi> (says he)
<hi>God deals with Men, as Parents
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99318:31"/>
use to deal with their sick Children:
They promise them many things,
rather to encourage them to take the
bitter potion prescribed, than out of
a real intention to bestow such
things. Reply.</hi> This Answer is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
unworthy to be considered,
since it so much reflects upon the
Divine wisdom and goodness, of
which we and all men ought to
entertain generous and becoming
thoughts: His promises and
threatnings too, are real and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
It is not to allure or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Men to live holily, that he
promiseth to lengthen their days;
when he well knows he had abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
fixed the Period of their
life.</p>
               <p>3. HE says, <hi>A good life is a
long life, and that</hi> Abraham <hi>died
in a good old age, because he was a
good Man. Reply.</hi> I know not
whether I should smile at the wit
and ingenuity of this Answer,
or commend the Author for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99318:32"/>
his happy invention: But it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not which of them we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The wicked</hi> (says he) <hi>are said
not to live out half their days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
according to the ordinary course
of nature, the date of their lives
might have been longer. Reply.</hi> But
if the Period of their lives be
absolutely determined, this super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Decree takes away that
supposed possibility of their living
longer. 2. This Answer is so
slight and inconsiderable as to the
end for which it is produced,
that it does not in the least agree
with the words of the Text; for
in this sense, many godly Men
may be said not to live out half
their days. But the Psalmist by
such a phrase holds out, that the
impiety of the wicked is the cause
that their days are shortened;
which he could not have said, if
their days had been absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:99318:32"/>
5. HE says, <hi>The wicked may
be said not to live out half their
days, in respect of their hopes and
expectations. Reply.</hi> The sacred
Text makes no mention of the
hopes and expectations of the
wicked; nor does this Paraphrase
any ways agree with the Psalmists
intention.</p>
               <p>1. THE Psalmists intention
was to shew, that wickedness is the
reason and cause of Mens short
lives. Now if he had only meant
their hopes and expectation, he
needed not have made any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wicked; for this
might have been applicable to the
most part of Men, both good and
bad.</p>
               <p>2. IT agrees not with the
Text, for if their days be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
they live out their whole
time, let them dye whensoever:
So that he could never have said,
<hi>They shall not live out half their
days.</hi> And indeed this had been
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99318:33"/>
no great punishment inflicted upon
the wicked for their Sins, if it
mean only their hopes; for good
Men may thereby be as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded:
and the wicked are not a
whit more unhappy than others,
if the case be so.</p>
               <p>THE Author is angry with
me, because I said, <hi>That if we
consult experience, we shall find the
Religious and Vertuous Men enjoy
ordinarily far the longest lives.</hi> Truly
I see no reason to repent what I
said, nor does the wise Man's
Observation any ways contradict
this; for all that he aims at there,
is to shew, that a good Man's
Righteousness will not be able to
defend him from the malice
and cruelty of the Wicked,
and that Wicked Men may
pass on in their Sins without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll.</p>
               <p>THAT the Divine promises
are notable encouragements to
live holy and devoutly, is very
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99318:33"/>
plain and undoubtable: But yet
it may be questioned whether,
according to some Mens princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
they be useful for the foresaid
end.</p>
               <p>A SECOND argument
I did urge, was taken <hi>from the
pious and devout Prayers of the
Righteous, and their turning from
their Sins by an hearty Repentance.</hi>
To this he Answers, <hi>That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Statutes, although they be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealable,
yet do not exclude the use
of Prayer, because it is included in
the Decree. Reply.</hi> I have already
told if there be any condition,
the Decree is not absolute: But
because I find the Author has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
recourse to this fancy, I
shall briefly evidence, that the
Author cannot make use of such
an evasion. <hi>Prayer and Repentance</hi>
(says the Author) <hi>are conditions
absolutely decreed, and therefore
they are necessary. Reply.</hi> The
<hi>Stoicks</hi> may have recourse to this,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99318:34"/>
as well as you: For Prayer and
Repentance are hereby made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
not because Men elicit
those acts as parts of their duty,
but because they cannot do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
And thus the Prophet
<hi>Daniel</hi> could not but pray, that
Gods anger should be removed
from his people <hi>Israel;</hi> because it
was absolutely before decreed.
The like was <hi>David</hi>'s case, and
others, mentioned by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
               <p>BUT by this means, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of Scripture can be of no
use to induce us to live holily,
for they are not conditional:
Thus, if you obey the Divine
Statutes, ye shall live long; and
if ye rebel, ye shall be punished.
But you shall obey the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and live long; and you shall
live wickedly, and have your days
shortned.</p>
               <p>THAT Prayer and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
have been the means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99318:34"/>
many Mens lives, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to experience; some few
instances to confirm so plain a
truth, I laid down in the first
discourse. I shall therefore now
only examin the Author's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
               <p>THE first instance was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the case of <hi>Nineveh,</hi>
where I told, <hi>That their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
did prevent the Execution of
the threatned Iudgment.</hi> To this
he answers; 1. <hi>That Prayer and
Repentance do not move God to change
his Decree. Reply.</hi> We do not say
that they do, only we say, there
was no absolute, but conditional
Decree in the case. 2. He says,
<hi>That their Repentance was from
Eternity decreed. Reply.</hi> How then
could the threatning be serious?
Do you think that a holy, wise,
and just God would threaten to
inflict a Judgment upon a people,
when he had absolutely decreed
that such a Judgment should not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99318:35"/>
be inflicted? To this, which he
could not but take notice of, he
answers, <hi>That such threatnings
only imply, that the nature of the
crime deserved to be punished with
this Iudgment. Reply.</hi> I know the
merit of every Sin is death, but
this is no Answer to the difficulty,
for the threatning not only implies
the demerit of the offence, but
also expresly declares, that the
Judgment threatned should be
inflicted, if they did not by their
Prayers and Repentance prevent
the Execution of it.</p>
               <p>A SECOND instance I
urged, was <hi>Hezekiah's recovery,
&amp;c.</hi> To this he Answers, 1. <hi>That
we must distinguish between the
threatnings and decrees of God.
Reply.</hi> Well, we shall observe this
caution, but upon this proviso,
that the Author will not make
the threatning inconsistent with
the Decree: for if God had abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
decreed that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> should
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99318:35"/>
not dye 'till the fifteen years were
expired, then how could the
threatning, <hi>Thou shalt surely dye and
not live,</hi> be serious? But that the first
was not absolutely decreed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be plain; for otherwise,
how could the fifteen years be
said to have been <hi>added to his
life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. HE says, <hi>The denunciation
of death was a conditional commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
absolutely propounded, inducing</hi>
Hezekiah <hi>to Repentance, having
no respect to the absolute Decree.
Reply.</hi> This Answer is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
nor agreeable to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
principles, for he alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that both the threatning and
Repentance are absolutely decreed:
now if the threatning had been
an argument to engage <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
to Repentance, we must suppose
that Repentance was not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
decreed, but a thing depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s will; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
both the threatning and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99318:36"/>
Repentance were slight, and of
no force: Nay indeed, since the
commination was only a Moral
act, it might have been an ineffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
motive. But since it had
(as the Author will say) its effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
from the internal operation
of the holy Spirit, hence is it,
that Repentance can be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
required on Man's part,
since it is not in his power not
to Repent when God works it in
him. And truly this makes
the threatning ridiculous, for
how can it be a motive to induce
to Repentance, since Repentance
is absolutely decreed, and in time
by a Physical predetermining act
wrought in Man nill he will
he.</p>
               <p>HOW the Author will be
able to absolve himself from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any respect to the two dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
opinions, he says we must
by all means avoid, I wish he
would seriously consider.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:99318:36"/>
I DO not well understand the
meaning of one phrase the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
useth, <hi>viz. That God did not
Will that</hi> Hezekiah <hi>should dye when
he threatned him; only he willed
that there should be such a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
This is indeed pretty sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
but I know not for what end
it was brought: Sure it is not very
pertinently alledged, if he thinks
hereby to prove, that there is no
opposition between the Decree
and the threatning; as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by what I have already
said.</p>
               <p>3. WE must <hi>distinguish</hi> (says
he) <hi>between the conjectural certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of death, inferred from the fatal
events which frequently accompany
dangerous Diseases; and the infallible
certainty of death, inferred from the
Decree. Reply.</hi> The distinction is
without controversie good, and
it is but reason we believe it;
but I assure the Author's appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is not always allowable.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99318:37"/>
I shall make this out by considering
how he applies this distinction.
<hi>In respect of the first</hi> (says he)
Hezekiah'<hi>s death might have been
said to be certain. Reply.</hi> We are
not to debate what <hi>might</hi> have
been, but what really was. Now
that denunciation, <hi>Thou shalt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
dye and not live;</hi> was no
conjecture taken from the danger
of the disease, but a prediction or
prophecy revealed by God to his
servant <hi>Isaiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANOTHER instance I ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
was <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 7, 8. where
we have a lively proof of the
vertue and efficacy of Prayer and
Repentance. To this he repeats
his old answer, <hi>That they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
efficacious because included in
the Decree. Reply.</hi> If they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
as absolutely decreed as the
end, then they are truly efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but not as conditions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of us to perform, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot but be effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99318:37"/>
because<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> decreed: And
thus all things come to pass fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.</p>
               <p>A THIRD argument to
prove that our lives may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
or shortened, I urged from
the use of Medicaments. To this
he Answers, <hi>That it is a precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
principle to separate the means
from the end, since the Decree is of
both. Reply.</hi> If the Decree inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
both be absolute, then both
the means and the end must be:
But then, as I already told, the
means are placed not in reference
to the end, but because they
could not but be placed. There
were but two consequences which
we have always alternatively ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
namely, if the Period of
Humane life be absolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
then either Humane care
and industry is needless, since all
the Medicaments of the World
cannot prolong our life one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
beyond the Divine decree;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99318:38"/>
nor the neglect thereof shorten
our life: Or else those Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
we must use are likewise
absolutely decreed, and then we
must of necessity use them: And
thus all care and choice, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
and deliberation is quite
destroyed. The skillful Physitian
upon this account deserves no
praise, nor the ignorant any chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng;
for the necessity that is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
excludes both.</p>
               <p>NOW if the opinion the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
maintains does not condemn
the use of Medicaments, yet it
introduceth a fatal necessity, which
is every whit as repugnant as the
former, and inconsistent with the
principles of Reason and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>AND thus <hi>Abraham</hi> could
not neglect the care of his Son
<hi>Isaac;</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> could not but
use the means, notwithstanding
he knew fifteen years should be
added to his life: for in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99318:38"/>
judgment both were abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
decreed.</p>
               <p>4. I TOLD, <hi>Nothing is more
evident, than that there are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things which have a Physical
efficacy, both in the prolonging and
shortening of our lives.</hi> He An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
1. <hi>That God does not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
second causes from acting, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that power he hath implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in them. Reply.</hi> Although this
be no Answer to the argument,
yet I shall take notice of it, as I
have done of many things which
did not much deserve to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
And 1. That God does
not for ordinary hinder second
causes from acting, according to
that power implanted in them in
their Creation, is true: But yet
in extraordinary cases, the supreme
Governor of the World may
overpower the Wills of the free
Agents, and hinder them from
acting what their Wills are bent
to commit, and he may impede
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99318:39"/>
natural Agents in acting what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
they are determined to do.
But 2. How can the Author ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
this to be reconcileable with
his opinion? For it is the nature
of a free Agent to elicit actions
freely; but if God has from the
out-goings of Eternity absolutely
decreed every thing they shall do,
they are no more left at liberty to
dod or not do, but they most of
necessity elicit the act they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to. But the Author
adds, <hi>That all things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
either to the prolonging or short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our life, are included in the
Decree. Reply.</hi> If they be indeed
included in the Decree, then it
is not absolute but conditional,
and upon fore-sight of mens being
placed in those circumstances;
but if he say that all circumstances
are absolutely decreed, then I again
tell him that he must shew us how
all things come not to pass by a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
necessity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:99318:39"/>
THE last argument I urged,
was, <hi>That many Men had lived
longer, if they had not foolishly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
themselves to danger.</hi> To this
he Answers, <hi>That Mens exposing
themselves to danger was included in
the Decree. Reply.</hi> If the Author
means that God did foresee all the
circumstances which Men are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in, in time, and then decreed
the Period of their life; he may
indeed say, that Mens exposing
of themselves to danger is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Decree: But if he
thinks that God did decree that
Men should be exposed to those
dangers which put a Period to
their lives; then he entertains
unbecoming thoughts of God; and
wherever he learned this Doctrin,
I am sure it hath no Foundation
in Scripture. See this more fully
cleared, <hi>Period of Humane Life,</hi> pag.
133, 134.</p>
               <p>THERE remains no more
now, but that I conclude with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99318:40"/>
my earnest intreaty, that Men
would heartily comply with the
last words of the Author's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
namely, <hi>That it is our
wisdom and advantage to live as
those, who know that e're long a
Period shall be put to their Beings.</hi>
If the Author be offended that I
have considered his Answer, I
hope I shall please him by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>

            <head>AN
APPENDIX.</head>
            <head type="sub">WHEREIN SEVERAL
OBJECTIONS,
URGED
In private Conferences, are examined.
TOGETHER WITH
A Survey of Mr. GALE'S
severe, but groundless charge.</head>
            <p>THE great desire I have
to clear all doubts
which can be urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the opinion I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
has engaged me in several
private conferences to try what
arguments men of better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99318:41"/>
than my self can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, instead of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
all I could hear urged
was odious censures, which as I
have always accounted unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
evidences of a bad cause,
so do I apprehend that method
very incongruous, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
others, or to find out the
truth.</p>
            <p>And although I have no great
desire to put my hand into a Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
Nest, yet because I now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to put a close to this debate,
I shall briefly examin all those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
charges I have met with,
hoping that henceforth men will
shew more candor and ingenuity,
and not rashly and inconsiderately
calumniate an Author they know
not, nor condemn an opinion
with hard words, when they can
urge nothing of reason against
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:99318:41"/>
The first heavy charge I met
with, is, that the opinion I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
is not <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and that the
Author is an <hi>Arminian;</hi> this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
I have in part already conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
I shall therefore now only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to know by what rule they
measure an opinion to be true or
false? If they will make Scripture
judge, I am sure their charge is
false; see <hi>Period of Humane Life,</hi>
pag. 118, 119, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, if
they will but stand to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of reason, they will find
themselves at a loss; but if they
run from Scripture and reason,
and make their own crooked fancy
the rule, I cannot help the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Common experience convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
us, that the most uncouth
notion is judged <hi>Orthodox</hi> by some
men, and that the best opinion
has not had the good hap to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by all men; but the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
censures of men is not enough
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99318:42"/>
to make a good opinion bad, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we should be continual seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but never find one Truth.</p>
            <p>I confess they are but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Writings of
<hi>Orthodox</hi> Divines, who say they
oppose the mutability of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of Humane Life; for my own
part I could never find any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
it but the <hi>Stoicks</hi> of old
and of late Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and his
Disciples, and those who run up
to the absolute decrees of Election
and Reprobation. And although
it be rejected and disallowed by
such, yet I hope they are not the
only <hi>Orthodox</hi> Divines.</p>
            <p>The present age (God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
is wiser than to be affrighted
with the word <hi>Arminian;</hi> those
who use such Objections may
please themselves to dispute with
Children; but if they combat
with Men, they will be but jeered
and contemned. I confess some
few years since it was scandal
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99318:42"/>
enough to be called an <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi>
but those dark days are gone,
and I hope in after ages that which
some men account an opprobrious
charge, shall be esteemed Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all this, I
do not say that I am an <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
nor am I offended at others
who call themselves <hi>Calvinists:</hi>
But methinks it were more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
like to reject all such names
which keep up differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, than to say, <hi>I am of</hi>
Paul, and <hi>I of</hi> Apollo, and a third
distinct from both, <hi>I am of</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas.</p>
            <p>2. Some men have told me, if
the shortning or lengthening out
of our life doth depend upon our
use, or neglect of the means, then
Gods particular providence in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
the World is enervated, if
not quite destroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I have been far rather
induced to believe, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99318:43"/>
of the opinion we defend,
opposeth the Divine providence;
for truly if all things are fatally
fixed from Eternity by an absolute
Decree, whether there be any
providence or not, things must
come to pass according to that
sempiternal series and concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of causes; but by maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the mutability of the Period
of Human Life, the Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
doth most conspicuously
appear, sometimes in removing
those things which should have
put a Period to our Being; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
permitting us to be exposed
to unseen and unexpected dangers.
O how wonderful, wise, and
mysterious are the ways of God!
His Providence is universal, and
extending to the most inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
actions. But yet we must
not foolishly imagin, men are
acted like meer Machins. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
providence doth not destroy
the innate freedom of Human
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99318:43"/>
natures. It is indeed evident by
the light of nature, that the great
Creator of the World should or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and govern it. No Parent is
so regardless of his Children as to
expose them to the dangers of the
World. The very Brutes by a
natural instinct guard, secure,
and take care of their young.
And can we think that our kind
Creator who has implanted these
principles of Care and Kindness in
his Creatures towards their off spring,
shall be less regardless of
his own Creatures.</p>
            <p>We then heartily accord that
the Divine providence is vigilant
and universal, and the opinion
we maintain gives us all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
that can be, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
so noble and generous
thoughts of that adorable Being,
who upholds us in Being. How
frequently had a Period been put
to our lives, if his watchful eye
and careful providence had not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99318:44"/>
red us from imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>When I consider that the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od
of my life is not immutably
and absolutely fixed, but may be
Millions of ways shortened, this
encourages me to cast my self up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Divine eare and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
But for others who are of
a contrary opinion, I confess I
cannot see how they have any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to do so, for they being once
confirmed in that opinion, that
their days can neither be extended
nor shortened, they need use no
diligence for their safety; they
cannot be encouraged to address
themselves to their Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Prayer, since all Care, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
and cannot alter the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>3. Others have told me, that
I make the Creature independent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They may as well say,
I make the Creature the Creator,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99318:44"/>
for both are equally false. I confess
it is not in my power to keep
men from deducing illegal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
and leading an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with inferences it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unacquainted with: yet,
since they are pleased to observe
this method, I will first vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
my own opinion, and then
examin whether theires can be
more justly condemned.</p>
            <p>First, then altho I grant that
the Period of Humane Life, is
for Ordinary, Mutable; yet, I
constantly affirm, That God is
the Supream Moderator and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verner
of the world, and is this
to make the Creator independent?
nay, Almighty God not only
adhibets a general concurse, but
he also in a more special and
particular providence, either af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
or withdraws occasions of
Safety: It is in his power to
Shorten or Prolong our lives,
and this he does many different
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99318:45"/>
wayes, which because they are
sometimes ordinary and common,
we but seldom regard them, but
when by an extraordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
he affords us unexpected
deliverances, we are then more
Sensible that his hand brought
us help; And is all this a dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the Creature?</p>
            <p>That Man, Created a free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
should be absolutely and
Physically predetermined to act,
is a harsh notion, quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to the common senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of mankind, and yet by
opposing this Predetermining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux,
I do not make man an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Creature; for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Creature is a plain
contradiction; but it is evident
enough, that it implyed no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
for God to Create a
free agent, who shall not stand
in need to be Physically prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to every act. Now
this once being admitted, it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99318:45"/>
may easily appear, that the
Period of Humane Life is not
immutably fixt; for since man
acts freely, he may either chuse
or reject, this or the other means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
upon which the extention, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviation,
of his Life consists.</p>
            <p>And yet Man is not hereby
made an independent being; for
as God hath set bounds to him,
over which he cannot pass, <hi>It
being appointed for all men once to
die;</hi> So hath he also absolute
rule of him, and may say, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
ye Children of men.</hi> And
thus although man is made a free
agent, yet he is not exempted
from the Divine Providence.</p>
            <p>But, Those who defend the
contrary opinion, although they
grant that man does in all his
actions depend upon God, yet,
they of necessity must deny that
he immediatly depends upon him:
for, besides the Divine eternal
Volition, they more over add a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99318:46"/>
Physical predetermining influx,
efficaciously and irresistably mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the will, which must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
mediate between the
Creator and Man.</p>
            <p>And thus, although God has
not absolutely decreed the Period
of every Mans Life, nor does
by a Physical predetermining
impulse move him to act, which
should make him rather a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin
than a Man, yet Man is not
independent in acting, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
immediately upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will, as I have already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
            <p>Indeed he who thinks the
Creature is independent, if it
be not Physically predetermined
to act, entertains a strang no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of independency: for it is
certain that the Humane Will is
not thus predetermined to sinful
acts, and I also desire to know if
necessary agents be thus acted: me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
such a superadded deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99318:46"/>
is very needless since
that natural propention, which
the great Creator endued them
with, is fixed and permanent
and sufficient enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin
them to act: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
the Fire, by it's natural
determination, necessary burns the
wood, and it needs no impulse,
or superadded motion to determin
it, and yet neither the Human
Will nor free agent are indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
beings.</p>
            <p>But not to insist in the refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of such trivial censures,
which the Authors can never form
in mode and figure against what
I have laid down in that discourse,
I shall now in the close examin
Mr. <hi>Gales</hi> severe charge laid
down in his Court of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
part 3. page.</p>
            <p>As an Appendix (Says he) to
natural Philosophy, we may add
Medicine which has had a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
influence upon Atheisme in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99318:47"/>
this regard, because these proud
Naturalists observing by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
many excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
virtues and Medicinal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencies,
in several Minerals,
Stones, Plants, Animals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
hence would fain perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and the World, the term
of Mans Life was not fixt but
variable and determinable by
their art and Medicaments, which
piece of Atheism continues to
this very day very common.</p>
            <p>Methinkes Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> if he had
been so good natured, might
have very well spared this Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
language and not have
treated those Learned men so
contemptuously; but I see it is
his humor to make every thing
have an influence upon Atheism,
and to quarrel with all Philosophy
but his own Reformed Scheme:
and yet it is ten to one if some
ill natured Inquisitive men find not
out some vanity, and malignity in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99318:47"/>
his own, which whether it may
arise from the vanity and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the object. Or 2. From
the vanity and malignity of the
subject. Or, 3. from the curse of
God or both, is an Enquiry I
shall not determin in, till I better
understand what sence these phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
can admit.</p>
            <p>But methinks it is a strange
thing why he is so much offended
with Pagan Philosophers, since he
alleadges as a prime cause of vain
Philosophy, the innate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genite
darkness or the native
ignorance of the understanding;
now how unreasonable is it to
challenge men for erring if ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
be congenite or native
to the understanding? He may
as well be angry with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had not these clear
revelations of the Divine mind
we are now blessed with.</p>
            <p>And yet, although there were
many errors in their Philosophy,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99318:48"/>
we must not therefore condemn
natural Philosophy nor reject all
those arts and sciences which have
errors necessary (in this imperfect
state) annexed to them; if we do
so we must reject all arts and scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and even his (I had almost mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
and said) <hi>own</hi> reformed
Philosophy. That Idolatry, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the effects of natural
Philosophy, is a dangerous position
of the Authors; for by the dark
light of nature men may know
that there is a God and that
Divine worship and adoration is
only to be given to that Supream
and Adorable Being, and if natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Philosophy be rejected how
shall we be able to dispute with
Atheists who wickedly deride
Sacred Writ.</p>
            <p>But as natural Philosophy hath
no powerful influence upon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,
so neither hath Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
which he adds as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix
to the former, however
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99318:48"/>
the Authors unbounded Zeal
transports him beyond the just
bounds of civility and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And now, that I may more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
examin this censure, I
shall first shew that Mr. <hi>Gales</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
is as weak as his judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that he has quite forgot that he
makes this piece of Atheism the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Pagan Philosophy. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I shall make it evident that those
proud (as he imprudently and
with more arrogance calls them)
Naturalists were neither proud
in there observations he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns,
nor proud in the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
deduced from thence: and
Thirdly, I shall make it plain
that Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> may be justly
charged with maintaining more
dangerous opinions.</p>
            <p>I begin with the First, to
shew that Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> elsewhere
seems to condemn himself for
saying, that it is the effect of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99318:49"/>
Pagan Philosophy to say, the
Period of Humane Life is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable;
to make out this I shall
only desire him to review part 4,
page 455. Where he will find
himself saying <hi>I am not ignorant</hi>
(the words are Mr. <hi>Gales) how
much some of late, as well Divines
as Phisitians, have essayed to exempt
the Period or term of Humane Life
from the immutable determination
of Divine providence; but how
much this hypothesis contradicts both
Pagan and Sacred Philosophy, will be
more fully evident, by what followes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, methinkes the Author
took too much pains to note,
that an effect of Pagan Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
which he confesseth, is
contradicted by it: but not to
take any more notice of the
Authors fighting with himself:
I shall proceed to the Second;
Namely, that Phisitians were
neither Arrogant in there obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he is pleased to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99318:49"/>
none yet in that inference
deduced from hence.</p>
            <p>First they were nor proud in
their observations; for to take
notice of the excellent qualities
and virtues of Herbs, Minerals,
Animals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is so far from
being discommended and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
that it is rather to be
regrated, that men of learning
and abilities should want encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
to proceed in such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries:
and truly those who lay out
there time in such a commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
study, will unquestionably
be celebrated by posterity, when
the names of those who discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them shall be unsavory if
not extinguished.</p>
            <p>Can it be questioned by any,
who pretends reason, that there
are excellent noble and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
vertues in some Plants,
Animals, and Minerals aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inst
several destempers? if this
be doubted common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99318:50"/>
will abundantly attest it;
but since this is so plain and
evident is it not lawfull from
hence to infer that the Period
of Human Life, is not absolutely
fixt: for if this were true it
were needless to search out the
vertues and effects of those
things, which can be used to
no purpose.</p>
            <p>But the great charge is, that
to affirm the term of Mens lives
is mutable, is <hi>a piece of Atheism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prevent such calumnies
there is no help but according
to the old saying <hi>si accusasse sat
esset quis foret innocens?</hi> And I
am sure the Scriptures teach us
another lesson and right reason
too; as for Pagan Philosophy I
confess I am not so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to examin it. I Know
he has the Stoick Philosophers
Patronizing his notion, while in
health, but I doubt if sickness
does not alter there judgments.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99318:50"/>
It is indeed good company to
see the most strict Stoick and
those of that perswasion, post
away messingers for the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
when under diseases; which
is evidence enough that they do
not believe the truth of what
they maintain.</p>
            <p>That the Hypothesis we defend
contradicts neither natural nor Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Philosophy, has been plainly
enough demonstrated in our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
discourse, neither doth Mr.
<hi>Gale</hi> for all his promise, urge it
with any argument, but in stead
of doing so he himself seems to
be guilty of that which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously
blames in others: And
thus I am led to the third thing
proposed to be discussed; namely,
that Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> may be justly
charged with maintaining more
dangerous opinions; and to make
good this charge I shall only
(because of the intended brevity)
mention two particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:99318:51"/>
The first is laid down in the Court
of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> page 367. where
distinguishing Gods Justice in
Absolute and Ordinative he adds,
<hi>that God by his absolute justice and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
can inflict the greatest tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
even of Hell it self on the
most innocent Creature.</hi> This is
indeed a morsel which sober men
cannot well swallow; it being
so quite contrary to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
notion which all mankind
entertain of God, and to those
excellent attributes of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
nature; by which he has dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
himself to the world
both by his word and workes.</p>
            <p>That Almighty God is to be
admired for his excellent power
and works of wonder, no sober
man ever doubted, but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
an unlimitted power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible
with the principle
attributes and perfections of his
Glorious nature, such as his
Goodness, Holiness, Mercy and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99318:51"/>
Justice, this were instead of
exalting his excellent power, a
denying of a Deity or at least
a making him, who is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Holy, merciful and Good,
seem (it is horrid to speak it)
Savage and Cruel. The Divine
goodness, truth and sanctity assure
us that he can do nothing that
is unbecoming his Glorious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
nor repugnant to his chiefe
perfections displayed in his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Word and dayly evident
by his Workes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us here appeal to judicious
Mr.</hi> Calvin <hi>lib. de Etern. Dei
predest.</hi> Sorbonicum illud dogma
in quo sibi plaudunt Papales Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gastri
detestor, quod potentiam ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutam

            </p>
            <p>Surely if to distroy the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

slay the righteous with the wicked,</hi>
Shall not the Judge of all the
Earth do right: how much rather
may we say so, when men tell
us that God can inflict the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
torments even of Hell it self
on the most innocent Creature;
it were easie to answer all the
silly instances brought in defence
of this horrid Doctrin, but I
have said enough in the passing
against it, only I must add that
this is a most dangerous opinion
inclining men to entertain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
conceptions of a Deity.
Plutarch lib. <hi>de Superst.</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
of the folly of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
to pacifie there offended
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99318:52"/>
Gods Sacrificed men and women
to them, adds that <hi>Diagoras,</hi> and
his Followers more reasonably
maintained the Being of such
Gods than those who confessed
a God, and believed they could
be appeased by such Savage cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
            <p>The Second particular I shall
instance, is laid down pag 483.
and frequently else where, <hi>God</hi>
(says he) <hi>is the prime efficient
cause of the material entitive act
of Sin.</hi> I know some others have
undertaken the defence of this
infamous Tenet, but patronize
it who will, it is an uncouth
opinion and chargeth the Holy
Lord, who is not a God that
hath pleasure in wickedness, with
Mens Sins.</p>
            <p>I confess, I could never yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what more was asserted
by those blasphemous Hereticks,
who boldly affirmed that God
was the Author of Sin; for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99318:53"/>
which pious antiquity did jointly
condemn them; for if the evil or
obliquity of Sin be (as they say) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
privation or relation, it is
evident that they necessarily result
from the placing of such actions
and cannot but follow their acts.</p>
            <p>It is indeed pity, that our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Divines should be all blamed
for the faults only of a few who
have imbibed this <hi>Dominican</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom,
and I have often regrated to
see the <hi>Iesuits</hi> so miserably baffle
men, maintaining this odd and
uncouth notion, and yet it is but
unhandsom dealing to charge that
notion upon all reformed <hi>Churches,</hi>
which has been alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the most Judicious
Writers we have.</p>
            <p>But to dispatch this as quickly
as I can, I shall only desire a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
Answer to the few fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Queries.</p>
            <p>First, If God be the prime
efficient cause of the material
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99318:53"/>
entitive act (that I may use his
phrase) of Sin, does not God
necessitate the Will to Sin? since
Man is hereby made the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
cause and God the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
overruling efficient cause;
and do you think that the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
cause, can resist when the
principle cause irresistably deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins
it to act?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is not the act pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinded
from the object? A meer
fancy and notion: Can there be
either Love or hatred when their
is no object to terminate them
upon?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the material act
of Sin be Good, is not every
sinfull act Morally Good as well
as Morally Evil.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When we enquire
if there be any thing in the
hatred of God that is good, do
we not Speak of a particular act
terminat upon its object, and not
of a Chimerical act which can
have no being?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:99318:54"/>
Fifthly, Is not that Sinfull
which is prohibited? but the act
it self is forbidden Men, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to do such and such things,
and their doing or acting makes
them lyable to punishment. Do
not Men by doing or omitting
that which the Divine precepts
forbid, become guilty? Is not Sin
a transgression of the Law, and
do not men transgress and violate
the Divine precepts when they
either commit or omit the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
action? Hence is it that very
many Learned Men rationally
conclude that Sin is not a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but a positive thing, since
the act is alwayes forbidden, and
therefore it must be formally evil;
and I confess it is a hard matter
to conjecture what can be the
foundation of that privation; or
if the act be placed, how the
obliquity does not necessarily
result.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, To permit is properly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99318:54"/>
a not hindring or impeding Men
to act; therefore the act is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for what can be hindered
cannot be properly said to be
permitted, but the obliquity is
such.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, If it were the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity
and not the act that is
permitted, then neither Devils
nor Men could tempt us to Sin,
for they cannot do any more but
Intice and Allure us to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
or omitting of the Acts,
which being placed, the obliquity
does necessarily result.</p>
            <p>Eigthly, Are Man any other
waies said to be hindered from
Sinning, but because they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded
from commiting the Act;
how then can the Holy Lord, be
the prime efficient cause of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
matter, or material enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Act of Sin?</p>
            <p>I have indeed seen an excellent
<hi>M. S S.</hi> where this odious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which has made our <hi>Church</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:99318:55"/>
is solidly rejected; till such time
as that become publick, these
few Arguments I have pitched
upon, may be of use to convince
us that Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> is in a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
            <p>I should now have proceeded
to the consideration of those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
he brings in defence of
his opinion, but I find this will
be more pertinent afterwards,
when a more fit occasion may
offer.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude, it is my
hearty desire that we may not,
while we are disputing about the
Period of our Lives, forget our
Mortality. Ere it be long a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
will be put to our beings;
and is it not our greatest concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to mind this in time, that
when this Life is ended we
may be admitted into that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
assembly of the Saints above,
who Live, but can die no more?</p>
