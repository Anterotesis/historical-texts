            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Ship <hi>Adventure,</hi> of which <hi>Thomas Gullock</hi> was Commander and <hi>Supra-Cargo,</hi>
bound to <hi>Borneo</hi> in <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> broke ground from <hi>Graves-End</hi> on the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>March</hi>
1697/8. and toucht at <hi>Brava</hi> one of the <hi>Cape de Verdy</hi> Iſlands, and having there got
plenty of Refreſhment, Fowls, Hogs, Goats and green Trade, proceeded on their
Voyage, and in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> fell in with the Coaſt of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> went to <hi>Padang</hi> to get
Refreſhment for the Ships Company, lay there five days, bought there four Bullocks, Fowls,
Fruit, green Herbs, Potato's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was equally divided to the Ships Company, alſo about a
Tun and half of Rice, and half a Butt of <hi>Arack,</hi> got one Boat-load of Water, and ſail'd thence;
about 20 days after, being by calms and currents driven near <hi>Naias,</hi> an Iſland inhabited by a
barbarous ſort of People who have no Commerce with any <hi>Europeans,</hi> came to an Anchor, the
Captain order'd the Long boat on ſhoar with empt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Cask to fill Water, under the charge of
Mr. <hi>William Hill</hi> his ſecond Mate, with 24 Men well arm'd, with orders that if a Gale of Wind
ſhould ſpring up, or that they ſhould ſee any Natives or tracks of them upon the Sand, then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to repair on Board without Water, being in no great want of it, but thought <hi>that</hi>
the beſt uſe could be made of the time whilſt lying at an Anchor. After the Long-boat was
put off, the Captain was in great perplexity leſt the Boats-crew might be deſtroyed by the
barbarous Natives, therefore went on ſhoar himſelf in his Yaul after them, and ſtay'd at the
watering place, being two or three hundred yards diſtant from the Boat, until Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> ſent
him word the Water-cask were full; the Captain then ſent him orders to ſend the Long-boat
on board with fifteen Men; <hi>Joſeph Bradiſh</hi> Boatſwains mate deſired Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> to let him have the
Yaul to tow the Long boat off from the ſhoar, which he agreed to, intending only the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Boat, but they continued to tow much farther than neceſſary, and then caſt off the
Tow-rope, laying the Yauls Head to the ſhoar, with only two Men as appear'd in her; when
the Long boat was near the Ship, two Men more roſe out of the Yauls hull, and then with four

John Lloyd, Thomas Hughs</hi> and others, ſeize Mr. <hi>Abraham Parrott</hi> the chief Mate, telling him he
was their Priſoner, and the Ship and all that was in her was their own. He asked them what
was the matter, and what they thought would be the end of it? They anſwered he need not
trouble himſelf about that, they were for <hi>A ſhort Life and a merry one.</hi> The Conſpirators being
immediately arm'd, made themſelves Maſters of the Ship, cut her Cable, looſed her Sails, and run
away with her, leaving the Captain and 14 Men upon the ſaid Iſland, expoſed to inexpreſſiable
Miſeries and Dangers, not only from the barbarous Natives, but Tygers and other wild Beaſts,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> without any manner of Proviſions, Moneys or Cloaths, except the worſt, which they had
on their backs, or any proſpect of returning to their Native Country, or indeed of ſo much as
preſerving their Lives.</p>

                  </gap> Grizley,</hi> and <hi>Franciſco</hi> an <hi>Indian,</hi> being ſuch
as would not joyn with them in their Villainous Deſign, not giving them one Bisket Cake,
or any Suſtenance, but refuſed to let them go to their own Cheſts to put on a Coat, Hat, or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30940:2"/>
Shoes, inſomuch that three were turned aſhoar without Coats or Hats, and two without Shoes,
and being forced to travel over ſharp Rocks, they, with others whoſe Shoes ſoon wore out,
had their Feet torn and mangled, and bled in ſuch a miſerable manner, that they deſired to
lye down and dye there, rather then to have gone on, if the Captain had not over perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them.</p>
            <p>The number left in this deplorable ſtate were 16 of their fellow Seamen, with the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and three Merchants, who, beſides the extream danger of periſhing there, were rob'd of
what they had aboard, fruſtrated of the fruits of their Voyage, and their poor Wives and
Children left to ſtarve at home. Eight have ſince periſhed by hunger and hardſhips, who, if
they were preſent, would more livelily ſet out the horrid Cruelty of thoſe unmerciful Men
who run away with the Ship, and left them in that miſerable and wretched Condition.</p>
            <p>This diſtreſſed Company being thus left, without any thing to eat, did remain ſo from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi>
morning the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> till <hi>Thurſday</hi> evening the <hi>22th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' the Barbarity of their fellow Seamen left them in ſuch unſpeakable diſtreſs, yet it
pleaſed God wonderfully to bring about Means for the Preſervation of a few of them to be
Witneſſes of ſo horrid a Villany; for there happened to come two Boats to the ſaid Iſland, which
the Captain did hire with the Promiſe of 500 Pieces of Eight to purſue his Ship, and was on
<hi>Munday</hi> the <hi>19th</hi> within 4 or 5 Miles of her, but by a ſudden Storm was forced aſhoar, and both
thoſe Boats ſtaved to pieces, only himſelf with 5 Men in the Yaul eſcaped that Ship-wrack.
But it pleaſed God none of them loſt their Lives, but all came by Land to a Creek or Cove,
whither the Captain with much toil and difficulty got in the Yaul; the Number was now
by theſe <hi>Atcheeners</hi> encreaſed to 42 Men, and no Boat or Veſſel but the Yaul, which could
not carry in the Sea above Eight or Ten. The <hi>Atcheeners</hi> ſeem'd moſt afraid of the Natives,
begging the Captain to ſtand by them, or elſe the Natives would either kill or make Slaves of
him and them; for they ſaid there was a Boat of <hi>Atcheen</hi> which came there the Year before,
the Men of which the Natives had knockt on the head, and halled the Boat up above High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
mark; this Boat was ſurvey'd and found much rent with the Sun, but that the <hi>Malayers</hi>
undertook to ſtop, and did ſo, with Moſs, Bark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilſt the Captain took care to get the
Sail and ſome other things of one of the wrack'd Boats, and did Launch her that day, (tho'
whilſt they were about it they were attack'd by 200 of the Natives, all arm'd with Swords,
Targets, and Launces, who made a fierce onſet, but by firing Twelve or Fourteen ſhot
were put to flight) and with her and the Yaul got off to ſmall Iſlands call'd <hi>Maroos,</hi> where
they got ſome Coker Nuts, and from a Boat they met at thoſe Iſlands got ſome Rice
which had been wet with Salt water in the ſame Storm when the two Boats were loſt, and
was heated and ſtank abominably, but was eaten heartily: This Boat pretended to belong to
<hi>Padang,</hi> ſo that the Captain agreed with the Maſter for tranſport to <hi>Padang,</hi> giving the launch'd
Boat to the <hi>Acheeners</hi> in lieu of their two Boats, which was all the Recompence he could
then poſſibly make them. Going with this Boat toward <hi>Sumatra</hi> they were chaſed with a
<hi>Malaya</hi> Pirate, who came up with them, but ſeeing them ſtand to their Arms bore up round,
and ſtood away without one word. Coming near <hi>Priaman</hi> there is a Shoal upon which the
<hi>Malayar</hi> ran his Boat; and when the Boat was on ground, the <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> all leapt over Board
to go to a dry Spot not far diſtant, but many had like to have been drown'd by holes in the
Rocks, which dipt them over head and ears, but others who could Swim aſſiſted and got them
ſafe to the dry Spot. The Captain went on ſhoar with the Yaul, and begg'd the Aſſiſtance of
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Corporal, who ſent a Boat with Natives, which brought the Men all off from that
Spot, which not long after was overflown with the Tide, otherwiſe they muſt have been
drowned; for the <hi>Malayar,</hi> after they jumpt out, got his Boat off, and went away without ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to expect his Freight, for what reaſon we know not. Two days after they went to <hi>Padang,</hi>
where being ill treated, and labouring under great Want and Sickneſs, three ſoon died there.
But it pleaſed God to raiſe them up there a Friend indeed, Mr. <hi>Antony Gillis</hi> a Native of <hi>India,</hi>
who pitied their Miſeries, relieved their Wants, and (under God) ſaved their Lives; whoſe
inexpreſſible and almoſt inimitable Charity, extended to the Dead and Living, ſhrowding the
one, and ſuccouring the other, which is here mention'd to his honour, and in gratitude to him.</p>
            <p>The remaining part of this diſtreſſed Company got their Paſſage to <hi>Bencoolen,</hi> whereof one
died by the way, and ſome remain'd there, of which three more ſoon died, and it is to be
fear'd ſeveral of the reſt which ſtaid there are ſince dead, for only ſix of the Company pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to <hi>Batavia,</hi> where, after a languiſhing Sickneſs, died one more, <hi>viz. George Rayner,</hi>
from which place the Commander and three more got paſſage to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The foregoing Account is given, not only by the Commander and poor ſurviving Seamen,
but was (long before the taking of any of the wicked Crew who run away with the Ship) writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
from <hi>Padang</hi> in a Letter to the Owners by Mr. <hi>Robert Anby</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ralph Peck,</hi> two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who, with ſome others, were to have ſtaid at <hi>Borneo</hi> to have ſettled a Factory; which
Letters, with two others from Mr. <hi>Nixon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Parrot</hi> at <hi>Batavia,</hi> may be ſeen at Mr. <hi>Crowches</hi>

                  <p>NOW, honoured Sirs, we humbly crave your leave to do our worthy Captain Juſtice, by
acquainting you of his particular care of the Ships Company, in reſpect to the health both of their
Souls and Bodies; we never failed of Morning and Evening Prayers in publick upon the Quarter Deck,
when the Weather would permit, our Commander daily endeavouring to ſuppreſs all manner of Vice, and
to encourage Vertue. As to the health of their Bodies, he was as tender as a Mother to any that were
ſick, daily minding the Doctor of his charge; and when he had freſh Proviſions at his own Table, would
ask the Doctor who was ſick, and always ſent them ſome. Thoſe that were in health he endeavoured to
keep ſo, by refreſhing twice or thrice a day in bad weather with Drams. In fine, God Almighty knows
our hearts that we ſpeak the truth; he is the moſt religious, ſober, careful and kind Commander that we
knew or heard of ever.</p>

Victuals or Victualling, nor never ſo much care taken, nor kindneſs ſhewn, both toward Soul and
Body, as was by the Commander, both to well and ſick; for tho' it pleaſed God to bleſs us with ſo health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
a Paſſage, that we never had any Man lay down three days together, yet hath the Captain often
circumvented me in ſending Broth or other freſh Proviſions to ſick Men from his own Table, and hath
ſundry times ordered Fowls to be kill'd expreſly for them only, and hath alſo ſeveral times in the Voyage
given of his Fowls to the whole Ships Company, and never kill'd a Hogg, but a great part was given
them; and the ſame by his Parſnips, Carrots, Pumkins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> allowing for the ſick Men Water grewel
with Fruit, Sugar and Spice, ſuch as I thought fit. Inſomuch that I am ready to give Oath, I have
heard them ſay ſundry times, that they never ſaw ſo good Victualling, nor a Commander ſo kind and
careful of his Men.</p>
                  <p>Alſo he ſo husbanded the Brandy allowed for them that they had Drams always when wet, and at the
turning out of the Watches. And the Ships Company drank all Beer until near the Southern Tropick,
and to the Eaſtward of the Cape, and then Beer and Water to the very laſt, giving the Seamen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſtrong Beer. As for Abuſes I never ſaw any or leſs ſtriking in any Ship where I have been, the
whole amounting to the puniſhment of four or five Perſons, and that for great Faults, as Thievery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Abraham Parrott</hi> Chief-mate, in his Letter to the Owners, gives the ſame account of
<hi>Victualling and Puniſhments, &amp;c.</hi> adding, <hi>That after the Seiſure of the Ship it was freely diſcourſt,</hi>

            <p>After they had ſeiſed the Ship, and turned aſhoar the five Perſons before-mentioned, they
ſailed about 50 Leagues to Sea from the Iſland, and then turn'd away in the Long Boat Mr. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham

            <p>This being done, they began to divide the Clothes and Moneys of thoſe whom they had ſo
left and turn'd aſhoar, and ſome time after divided the Pieces of Eight belonging to the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
weighing to each Man his Proportion by the Stillyards, which came to about Fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pieces of Eight a Man.</p>
            <p>When they came near the Coaſt of <hi>New-England</hi> they agreed to deſtroy all the Journals and
Writings aboard, which they did by putting them into a Bagg, and ſinking them with Shot,
ſaying, <hi>They ſhould not riſe up againſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, near to <hi>Block-Iſland,</hi> they diſperſt themſelves into ſeveral Sloops, taking with them
their Moneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and were not contented with that, but fired five Guns through the Ships
bottom, and ſunk her in deep Water, with the Cloath, Lead, Iron, and other Commodities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board;

to their Trial on the <hi>21ſt</hi> of <hi>June</hi> laſt at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> where what they ſaid for themſelves,
as to the Matter of Fact, was frivolous and inconſiſtent, but endeavoured to extenuate their
Crime by charging the Commander with Severity and Ill uſage, from which the Court was

and 19 more to thoſe inexpreſſible Hardſhips and Miſeries, whereby the King loſt eight of
his Subjects by untimely death, and no more than three beſides himſelf return'd to <hi>England,</hi> of
the 20 left on ſhoar,) but farther endeavoured to Murther his Reputation with moſt unjuſt,
and baſe Aſperſions. As for the Victualling of his Ship, he ſaid, that on <hi>Sundays, Tueſdays</hi> and
<hi>Thurſdays</hi> they had every Meſs a piece of good Beef and a Pudding of two pound and a half of
Flower with ¼ of Suet, beſides Butter or Cheeſe for Breakfaſt. That on <hi>Mondays</hi> and <hi>Fridays</hi>
they had Pork and Peaſe, with Breakfaſt as before: On <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Saturdays</hi> Fiſh and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goo;
and they had Burgoo for Breakfaſt, with Butter and Sugar, on thoſe days. That they
had three Cans of Beer a Meſs every day till far beyond the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> and after that
two Cans of good Beer and Water; and when they drank Water, there was a Cask with a
Scuttle or Hole cut at the Bung enough to put a Cup in and drink when they pleas'd, laſh'd
faſt to the Main-maſt upon the Main-deck, fill'd as often as there was occaſion. Alſo
that they had 28 pound of Bread <hi>per</hi> Week every Meſs, until <hi>John Lloyd</hi> deſired the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to let him put two bags of Bread about 50 pound each, (which his Meſs alone
had ſaved out of their Allowance) into the Bread-room, which was done accordingly. That
then they were at no Allowance for a Fortnight or three Weeks, but had the Bread in an open
Cask in the Steerage, to eat when and what they pleas'd, until they left it greaſie up and down
where they eat, and then 'twas retrencht to 25 pound <hi>per</hi> Week every Meſs, and never leſs by
his order or knowledge. Alſo that they had Drams Morning and Evening when fair, and as
often as the Watches was chang'd when wet, never letting them go to their Hamocks wet
without a Dram, to be ſure of which he did not ſuffer the Steward to give it them below, but
conſtantly his own Servant at his Round houſe door. Alſo that every Meſs had on <hi>Sundays</hi> a
Can of ſtrong Beer; and when about the <hi>Cape</hi> in cold raw weather, they have often had, both
Morning and Evening, Burgoo, and ſometimes Fowls for the whole Ships Company<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, with a
very particular regard to all ſick Men.</p>
            <p>The ſame Account <hi>John Weſtby, Robert Amſdem,</hi> and <hi>William Saunders upon Oath</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd;
except that Mr. <hi>Weſtby</hi> and <hi>Amſden</hi> ſaid, they once heard or ſaw that one Meſs
had but Sixteen pound of Bread one Week, which the Captain ſaid he never heard
any Complaint of, for if he had, he ſhould have as readily redreſt it as he did the only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
was ever made him of Victuals, which was by <hi>William Griffeth,</hi> who brought him a
piece of Pork very ſmall, which he order'd his Servant to take from him, and give <hi>Griffeth</hi> a
piece from his own Table in exchange for it; the truth of which was confirm'd by the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and cannot he deny'd by the Priſoners themſelves, unleſs they will run the hazard of
going from Man's Judgment to the moſt tremendous and eternal Judgment of God with guilt.</p>
            <p>As for Chaſtiſement, he did acknowledge that <hi>Ham Edgell</hi> and <hi>Wetherell</hi> had been
puniſhed; <hi>Edgell</hi> becauſe that he being a Quarter-Maſter, working in the <hi>Lazaretta,</hi> did break
open a Box, and ſtole about a dozen pound of white Suger; the next day the Captain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
at once all Keys of Cheſts, and did find the Sugar in his Cheſt: which Felony he
thought fit publickly to puniſh, eſpecially in him, who being a Quarter-Maſter, might have the
opportunity of the ſame Fact in Goods of far greater value, and that it might prove exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the whole Ships Company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward Ham</hi> purely for the welfare of thoſe who complain againſt it, becauſe that he after
many checks, and ſome blows, continued naſty to that degree, that upon a complaint of the
copperiſhneſs of the Peaſe, the Captain himſelf went into the Cook-room, and took off the
ſides of the Copper a great quantity of Verdigreeſe, for which the Captain beat him with a
Japan Cane, but not to that degree as at all to wound or break his Skin, as the Chirurgeon's Mate,
Mr. <hi>Weſtby</hi> confirmed upon Oath. And <hi>Witherell</hi> was beaten for ſtriking the Boatſwain of the
Ship. And if Correction in ſuch Caſes be not uſed aboard Ships, no order can be maintain'd,
but all would run into Confuſion.</p>
            <p>And theſe very Men themſelves, ſometime after Seiſure of the Ship, did ſeiſe the ſame <hi>Edward
Ham</hi> to the Gang-way, and ſeverely beat him for the ſame Crime.</p>
