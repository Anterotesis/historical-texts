            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here has not been any point, perhaps, in the whole
Tract of <hi>English Story,</hi> either so dangerous to
be mistaken in, or so difficult, and yet so necessary
to be understood. as the Mystery of this detestable
<hi>Plot</hi> now in Agitation, (A Iudgment for our Sins,
augmented by our Follies) But the world is so
miserably divided betwixt some that will believe every thing, and
others nothing, that not only <hi>Truth,</hi> but <hi>Christianity</hi> it self is almost
lost between them; and no place left for Sobriety and Moderation.
We are come to govern our selves by Dreams, and Imaginations; We
make every <hi>Coffee-house Tale</hi> an Article of our Faith; and from
Incredible Fables we raise Invincible Arguments. A man must be
Fierce and violent, to get the Reputation of being <hi>Well-Affected;</hi>
as if the calling of one another <hi>Damn'd Heretique,</hi> and <hi>Popish
Dog,</hi> were the whole Sum of the Controversie. And what's all this
but the effect of a Popular Licence and Appeal? When every Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Scribler shall take upon him to handle matters of Faith, and
State; give Laws to Princes; and every Mechanique sit Iudge upon
the Government! Were not these the very Circumstances of the late
<hi>Times?</hi> When the Religious Iugglers from all Quarters fell in with
the Rabble; and managed them, as it were, by a certain fleight of
hand: The <hi>Rods</hi> were turned into <hi>Serpents</hi> on both sides, and the
Multitude not able to say, which was <hi>Aaron,</hi> and which the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter.</hi>
Let us have a Care of the same Incantation over again. Are
we not under the protection of a Lawful Authority? Nor was there
ever any thing more narrowly Sifted, or more vigorously discouraged,
than this <hi>Conspiracy. Reformation</hi> is the proper business of
<hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Council;</hi> but when it comes to work once at the
wrong End, there is nothing to be expected from it, but <hi>Tumult</hi> and
<hi>Convulsion.</hi> A Legal and Effectual provision against the Danger of
<hi>Romish Practices</hi> and <hi>Errours,</hi> will never serve their turn, whose
Quarrel is barely to the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> without understanding
the <hi>Thing</hi> it self. And if there were not a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> left
in the three Kingdoms, they would be never the better satisfied; for
where they cannot <hi>find</hi> Popery, they will <hi>make</hi> it: nay and be troubled
<pb facs="tcp:93059:3"/>
too that they could not <hi>find</hi> it. It is no new thing for a Popular
Out-cry, in the matter of <hi>Religion,</hi> to have a <hi>State-Faction</hi> in the
belly of it. The first late Clamor was against <hi>Downright Popery;</hi>
and then came on <hi>Popishly Affected; (That</hi> sweeps all) The
<hi>Order of Bishops, and the Discipline of the Church</hi> took their
Turns next; and the next blow was at the <hi>Crown</hi> it self: when
every Man was made a <hi>Papist</hi> that would not play the Knave and the
Fool, for Company, with the Common People.</p>
            <p>These things duly weighed, and considering the Ground of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Distempers; the Compiler of this Abridgment reckoned that he
could not do his Countrymen a better Office, than (by laying before
them the naked state of things) to give them at one view, a Prospect,
both of the subject matter of their Apprehensions, and of the Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
Zeal, and needful severity of the Government on their behalf.
To which end, he hath here drawn up an <hi>Historical Abstract</hi> of the
whole matter of Fact concerning those Persons who have hitherto been
Tried for their Lives, either upon the <hi>Plot</hi> it self, or in Relation to
it: opposing Authentick Records to wandring Rumours; and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the <hi>Truth</hi> in all Simplicity. He hath not omitted any one
material Point: There is not so much as one <hi>Partial Stroke</hi> in it;
not a flourish, nor any thing but a bare and plain <hi>Collection,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Tincture either of Credulity, or Passion. And it is brought
into so narrow a Compass too, that it will ease the Readers <hi>head,</hi> as
well as his <hi>purse;</hi> by clearing him of the puzzle of <hi>Forms,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlocutories,</hi>
that serve only to amuse and mislead a man, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Order, and confounding the Relative part of the <hi>Proceeding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having this in Contemplation; and being at the same time possest
of a most exact <hi>Summary</hi> of all passages here in Question; This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter
was only to cast an Extract of these Notes into a Method:
especially finding, that upon comparing the substance of his own papers,
with the most warrantable Prints that have been published; his own
<hi>Abstract</hi> proved to be not only every jot as Correct, but much more
Intelligible, which being <hi>short</hi> and <hi>full;</hi> he thought might be useful,
and find Credit in the world upon its own account, without need of a
<hi>Voucher.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first of the Conspirators that was brought to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Justice was Mr. <hi>Edward Coleman;</hi> who received
his Trial at the <hi>Kings Bench-Bar, Novemb.</hi> 27. 1678.
and pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> to the Indictment.</p>
            <p>The Jury consisted of Persons of Condition, and
known Integrity; being Sworn, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
or challenge from the Prisoner.</p>
            <p>The General Heads of his Charge were, <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
of the death of the King. The endeavour of Subverting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of</hi> England; <hi>and the Protestant Religion.</hi> And these Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and Designs, to be made out against him, partly by Witnesses,
<hi>vivâ voce;</hi> and partly by Letters and Negotiations under his own Hand,
proving a Correspondence with several sorts of Agents for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
of the aforesaid ends.</p>
            <p>The Charge being read, and the particulars of the matter in Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
modestly and learnedly opened by His Majesties Councel, The
Prisoner past some reflections upon the hard measure of not allowing
Councel to a Prisoner in this Case, recommending himself to the Justice
of the Bench to be Councel for him, and representing the disadvantage
of a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks appearing at the Bar under so violent a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
he insisted further, upon the Ingenuity of his Confessions in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and it being objected to him, as a thing incredible, that he should
break off his Correspondences just at (75) with the Date of the last Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of his that were found: His answer was, that he never received any
Letters after that time, but cursory Intelligence, which were either
Burnt, or used as common Paper: And that he had offered all Oaths
and Tests in the world for Confirmation of the truth thereof: and that
they had seized every one of these Letters of general Correspondence,
for the two or three years last past that he knew of.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Court proceeded to the Evidence, the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
previously inculcating, the sacredness of an Oath,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> sworn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Plot upon the King. He goes to Father <hi>Keyns</hi> at <hi>Colemans.</hi>
               </note> and Exhorting
both the Jury, and Witnesses, to proceed with all due Tenderness and
Caution: for the life of a man was at stake, and it was not intended
that any thing should be put upon the stretch against the Prisoner.</p>
            <p>The Witness first called, was Mr. <hi>Oates;</hi> and the first thing demanded
of him, was <hi>what he could say of the Prisoner being any way privy to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Murthering the King,</hi> To which, he gave Evidence, as follows;
that is to say:</p>
            <p>

That in <hi>November</hi> last, making a Visit to Mr. <hi>Iohn Keyns</hi> (his Father
Confessor, then lodging at Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> in <hi>Stable-Yard</hi>) Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>
asked him <hi>who that was?</hi> one (says he) that is going to St. <hi>Omers.</hi> Then
says Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> to the Witness, <hi>I must trouble you with a Letter or two;</hi>
and I will leave them for you with <hi>Fenwick</hi> (the <hi>Procurator</hi> of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>

with a <hi>French</hi> name, and asked how he did; the Witness not
well understanding him, (being at a loss) One (says <hi>La Chaise) that was
formerly Secretary to her Royal Highness:</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi>
asked him if it were not <hi>Coleman;</hi> But what answer was made to this,
Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> does not remember. <hi>La Chaise</hi> answered his Letter, and the
Witness brought that answer to St. <hi>Omers;</hi> from whence it was sent by
the Society, under Cover to Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> telling him in express terms
that this Letter was received and owned.</p>
            <p>The Witness having a Patent to be taken into the Consult,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had a <hi>Patent</hi> to be of the <hi>Consult.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> being demanded what he could say to the Consultation here
in <hi>May</hi> last, and how far the Prisoner was privy to the purpose of
Murthering the King, he proceeded to this effect.</p>
            <p>By vertue of a Brief from the Father General of the Society at <hi>Rome,</hi>
the Jesuits were appointed to have a meeting, which begun at the <hi>White-Horse-Tavern</hi>

of one Father <hi>Cary,</hi> an Agent, and Procurator for <hi>Rome;</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93059:4"/>
then they Adjourned themselves into Clubs and Cabals, some at <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi>
some at <hi>Harcourts, Irelands, Fenwicks</hi> Lodgings, and came at
length to this Result.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> were to destroy the King, either by shot,<note place="margin">The <hi>result</hi> of that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> or
otherwise; and for their Reward, <hi>Grove</hi> was to have fifteen hundred
Pounds, and <hi>Pickering</hi> (being a Religious person) 30000 Masses,
which may be valued an Equivalent, at Twelve pence a Mass. Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
in this Deponents hearing, was told of this determination at
<hi>Wildhouse;</hi> and the Witness affirms, to have seen a Letter under the
Prisoners own hand, to one <hi>Ireland;</hi> expressing his desire that by some
means or other, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> might be Trapann'd into the Plot.
There was a P. S. to this Letter, <hi>Recommend me to Father La Chaise.</hi>
And besides all this, the Witness averrs, that he heard <hi>Coleman</hi> give
his opinion at <hi>Wildhouse, that he thought it was well contrived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next point was what the Witness knew of any Rebellion to have
been raised in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Touching a <hi>Rebellion</hi> to have been raised in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> or of any practice designed upon the Duke of

            <p>That in <hi>August,</hi> there was a Consultation at the <hi>Savoy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A <hi>Consult</hi> at the <hi>Savoy</hi> about it.</note> with the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>

pretended Archbishop of <hi>Dublin</hi>) making mention of one of the Popes
Legates, an <hi>Italian</hi> Bishop (<hi>Cassay,</hi> as he believed) that maintains the
Popes Claim to the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And in this Letter, he speaks
of <hi>four Iesuits,</hi> that were contriving the death of the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
and in case that design should not take place, that then, <hi>Fogarthy</hi> should
do it by Poyson, (<hi>Fogarthy</hi> himself being there at that time.) That
before the end of the Consult, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> came in, and earnestly prest
the dispatch of <hi>Fogarthy</hi> for <hi>Ireland,</hi> to do the Work. The same Letter
did also say, that they were ready to rise in <hi>Ireland</hi> for the Pope.</p>
            <p>The Witness being asked if he knew any thing of <hi>Arms:</hi> Gave
Evidence,<note place="margin">Arms to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
               </note> That 40000 Blank Bills were provided to be sent into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And that another Letter from <hi>Talbot,</hi> (of <hi>Ianuary</hi> or <hi>February</hi>
last) said they were furnished by the Popish Commission-Officers, and
that they had them ready in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Coleman, Fenwick,</hi> and the Witness, being together in <hi>August</hi>
last, in <hi>Fenwicks</hi> Chamber, in <hi>Drury Lane,</hi> without any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<hi>Coleman</hi> told <hi>Fenwick</hi> that he had a way now to transmit the

to this Deponent also a Week before; so that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was privy to
it, and a prime Actor in it.</p>
            <p>The Witness was now examined about Transmitting money to <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Money to be sent to <hi>Windsor.</hi>

               <note place="margin">The four <hi>Irish Ruffians</hi> sent away, and 80 <hi>l.</hi> sent after them.</note> in <hi>August</hi> last, and they were dispatched the same night.
That the next day, one <hi>William Harcourt,</hi> Rector of <hi>London,</hi> sent four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
pounds to them, in the name of the Provincial, who was then
beyond the Seas: And by whose Authority the other acted. That
Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> told the Witness, that he had been to look for <hi>Harcourt</hi> at
his house in <hi>Drury Lane,</hi> and was there directed to <hi>Wildhouse,</hi> where
he sound him. And <hi>Coleman</hi> asking <hi>what care was taken for the four
Gentlemen that went last night to Windsor? Harcourt</hi> made answer, that
<hi>Eighty Pounds was ordered them;</hi> and that the Messenger was there that
was to carry it. That the money was there upon the Table, most in
<hi>Guinnies,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> gave the Messenger a <hi>Guinny</hi> to make
haste. And that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> never saw the Messenger, but that time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93059:5"/>
The Witness was asked what he knew concerning Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with one <hi>Ashby;</hi>

               </note> whose evidence was that one <hi>Ashby</hi> (in <hi>Iuly</hi> last,

Majesty Physick, That Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> attended this <hi>Ashby;</hi> that he saw
Read, and Copyed out the Instructions, and sent them over <hi>England,</hi>
to those that were privy to the Plot, That this Deponent himself saw
the Reading, and the Transcribing of them, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> declaring the
sum to be too little, and that Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> would hardly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it upon those terms; adding; That it were well to give 5000 <hi>l.</hi>
more to make the business sure: and that this was said at <hi>Wild-House,</hi> at
Mr. <hi>Sandersons</hi> house: and that upon Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> dispatch of these
<hi>Suffrages</hi> (the word he used for <hi>Instructions</hi>) to the Principal of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> some thousands of Pounds were Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and that <hi>Coleman</hi> told the Witness, that he sent these Copies about
to quicken people in their Contributions.</p>
            <p>The Court demanded if Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was not to have been one of
the Secretaries of State; to which Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> replyed thus.</p>
            <p>That in <hi>May</hi> last <hi>New Stile, April, Old,</hi> soon after the Consult at
Mr. <hi>Langhorns</hi> Chamber, among other Commissions he saw one from the

it at Mr. <hi>Fenwicks</hi> Chamber in <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> in the month of <hi>Iuly,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> being present; and that Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> did then, and there,

that he knew this to be the writing of the said General, for he had seen
it forty times.</p>
            <p>That in the month <hi>Ian.</hi> the Witness opened at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> certain Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

wherein it was certified that the Commissions were already in Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns</hi>
hands,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> shews Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions.</note> which gave the Witness a curiosity to ask Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them. Now the Witness being summoned to be at the Consult
in <hi>April,</hi> and appointed by the Provincial to wait upon Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi>
he did so, and in discourse about the Commissions, asked him if he
might not have a sight of them: To which Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> replyed, that
he had received the Commissions; and that he would not scruple to let
him have a view of them, the Witness giving him that very day an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

            <p>The Witness was asked if he were acquainted with <hi>Langhorn,</hi>

received him with great Civility at his house, (somewhere about
<hi>Sheer-Lane</hi>) but the Wife being zealous another way, Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi>
advised the Witness rather to come to him for the future at his Chamber
in the Temple; and that the Witness was ordered by the Provincial to

of <hi>Watton, Francis Williams,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Warner, Charges;</hi> one <hi>Poole</hi> a

he could not remember it, and that to his knowledg there had been in
<hi>England,</hi> at the same time 160 <hi>Secular Priests, 80 Iesuits,</hi> and by names
upon a List, above 300.</p>
            <p>The Prisoner being now permitted to ask any questions,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> and speak

            <p>Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> suggested,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> did not know <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> at the Council.</note> that upon his Examination before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
the Witness told His Majesty that he had never seen him before, and
yet now pretends to great intimacy and acquaintance with him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> alledged that in truth he said (his sight being had by Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-light)
<hi>that he would not swear that he had ever seen him before;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Not till he spake, for the Candle was in his Eyes.</note> but

            <p>It being demanded,<note place="margin">How came Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> to omit his Charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Council?</hi>
               </note> (when the design upon the King at <hi>Windsor</hi> was
before the Council) how the Witness came to omit Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> giving
the <hi>Guiny</hi> to the Messenger; the time when the Fourscore pounds was
sent; the way of remitting the 200000 <hi>l.</hi> The Prisoner Consulting and
approving of the Murther of the King; and his saying that 10000 <hi>l.</hi>
was too small a reward for Sir <hi>George Wakeman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his answer to all this;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s answer to the former objections.</note>. was that his business before the
Council was rather to Exhibit an Information, than to deliver a
Charge; and that it gives light to a Prisoner how to shift, when he
knows the whole matter of his Accusation beforehand; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
he was so spent with waiting and watching, that he could scarce
stand upon his Legs: And that the King and Council were sensible of
it, and willing to ease him, but yet if he had been prest, he should
have enlarged his Information.</p>
            <p>The Witness being examined how long it was betwixt the time of his
being Interrogated, and speaking only to the Letters, and that time of
communicating to the Houses of Parliament; the matter at present in
question, his answer was, from <hi>Monday</hi> the 30. of <hi>September,</hi> until the
Parliament met.</p>
            <p>The Witness was likewise asked why he did not inform sooner;<note place="margin">Why was this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed so long? with Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s reasons for it.</note> and
of all together, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> being so dangerous a person, and engaged
in so desperate a design, why he did not name the Jesuits he accused.
And how he came to charge Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> by name, and not
Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> reply was that he had been a long time accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
other Jesuites; that he spake little but where the persons were Face
to Face. That he had a List of the Jesuits names, but only such as
were expresly charged were taken up, and that being dosed with sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up two nights, he forgot Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> but upon Consulting
his papers he made upthe accompt which afterwards he delivered.</p>
            <p>The Prisoner urged that the Witness was just by him when he says he
could not see him;<note place="margin">Whether Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> knew <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> before the Council or nor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and further that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> named three or four
places where he says he met him about Business: The Witness answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Candle was in his Eyes, and that the Prisoner stood more in
the dark: and to the rest, that he wore several Peruques at several
meetings; which much disguised him: but that immediately upon speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93059:6"/>
he knew him to be <hi>Coleman,</hi> denying that the question was ever put
to him whether he knew <hi>Coleman</hi> or no?</p>
            <p>The Prisoner still insisting upon it,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Thomas Doleman</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined to that point.</note> that the Witness did declare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Council that he did not know him; Sir <hi>Thomas Doleman,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Robert Southwel</hi> (being Clerks of the Council, and at that time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
were examined on the behalf of the Prisoner, Sir <hi>Tho. Dolemans</hi>
Evidence amounted to this, That Mr. <hi>Oates speaking of</hi> Coleman; <hi>did
say before the Council, that he did not well know him;</hi> and that he said these
words after Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was examined, adding that the Witness said, <hi>he

had no acquaintance with that man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was asked Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> in regard that he knew <hi>Coleman</hi> upon hearing
of his voice, why he did not declare himself that he knew him so soon
as he had heard him? To which the Witness answered, <hi>That he was

            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Southwel</hi>

declared that 10000 pounds promised to Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was now
made <hi>fifteen,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> paid Sir <hi>George Wakeman five thousand
pounds</hi> in hand. To which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> replied; That Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his
Charge was so slight, that the Council were not of his opinion, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by the mitigation of the first Order, which was at first to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to <hi>Newgate,</hi> but only now into the Custody of a Messenger.
To this Sir <hi>Robert Southwel</hi> gave an account, how that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was so general, it could not well be fixed; That Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi>
Papers were found, and seized on <hi>Sunday night,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>
rendred himself voluntarily at the house of Sir <hi>Ioseph Williamson,</hi> on
<hi>Monday Morning,</hi> hearing of a Warrant out against him: But so many
other Prisoners were upon Examination, that he was not called till
Afternoon, when he seemed to hear these lewd things charged upon
him with great scorn and indignation.</p>
            <p>The defence he made was such,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Colemans</hi> Defence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council.</note> that though a Blank Warrant was
filled up to send him to <hi>Newgate,</hi> he was only for the present committed

several Papers, and Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> amongst others; There were found

               </note> swears that he knew nothing of any Commission to
Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> more than that Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourn</hi> told him that he
brought him a Commission from the principal Jesuits at <hi>Rome,</hi> by Order
from his Holiness; and that he was to be Secretary of State, but that
he never saw it, nor knows the Title of it. As to any discourse with
Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> about it, the Witness declared, that in <hi>April</hi> (75.) Father
<hi>Harcourt</hi> gave him a large Pacquet of Letters from Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> who in
the Witnesses sight delivered the said Letters to Father <hi>Harcourt;</hi> that
they were directed to Mr. <hi>La Chaise,</hi> and other <hi>English Monks,</hi> to whom
he delivered the Letters, and brought back an Answer from <hi>La Chaise,</hi>
and certain <hi>English Monks</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> furthur declares, that
there met at a Consultation two <hi>French Abbots,</hi> and certain <hi>English
Monks,</hi> and that he heard them talk of a Plot upon the Government,
and Religion of <hi>England;</hi> And that the King was to be destroyed in
the first place, and the Lords of the Council; That this discourse passed
upon the Consultation; And there was a Pacquet of Letters from
Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> they not knowing that the Witness understood <hi>French.</hi>
That the Pacquet from <hi>La Chaise</hi> was directed to <hi>Harcourt,</hi> with one to
<hi>Coleman</hi> enclosed, and addressed <hi>A Monsieur, Monsieur Coleman.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>That it was to promote the subversion of the Government of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to deliver it from Hellish Ignorance, and to free Catholicks from
the Tyranny of Hereticks. The Witness further declareth, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Harcourt</hi> at <hi>Colemans, May</hi> 24. or 25. 1677. <hi>Harcourt</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
this Deponent another Pacquet, which he had also from Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
for the <hi>English Monks</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Witness to call at <hi>Douay,</hi>
in his passage, in case they were not gone for <hi>Paris</hi> before him. That
upon the receipt of these Letters they applauded the merit of the service,
and that upon the Consultation 1677, not having any full assurance
what assistance the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks might have from abroad, they
resolved to put their design in execution that very Summer, the <hi>English</hi>
being in a great forwardness already. That the Witness after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
gave <hi>Le Faire</hi> the Letters, and he carried them to <hi>Harcourt,</hi>
and <hi>Harcourt</hi> (though indisposed) went and carried them to <hi>Coleman,</hi>
and this Witness along with him, but he stayed over the way while
<hi>Harcourt</hi> went in, who soon after gave this Witness a Back to come
over to him, and then, and there, did this Witness hear <hi>Coleman</hi> say,
<hi>If he had a hundred lives he would lose them all to settle the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in</hi> England, <hi>and depose, or destroy a hundred Heretical Kings if they
stood in his way.</hi> And this at his own house, behind <hi>Westminster Abby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
at the foot of the Stair-case.</p>
            <p>Here the Prisoner demanded of <hi>Bedlow,</hi> if ever he had seen him in his
life? Whose answer was, That in the <hi>Stone-Gallery</hi> in <hi>Summerset House,</hi>
coming from a Consult, there he had seen him.</p>
            <p>After this Mr. <hi>Bradley,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> (the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</note> the Messenger that seized Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> Papers,
was examined what Papers he seized, what he saw, and how he dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of them. To which Mr. <hi>Bradly</hi> rendred this account.</p>
            <p>That by Warrant of Council,<note place="margin">His account about sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing M. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</note> dated <hi>September</hi> 29. at six at night, for
the apprehending of Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> and seizing of his Papers, he went
accordingly, and told Mrs. <hi>Coleman</hi> his business, who said he was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com.
And her Husband not being at home, he desired her to send for
him. That upon the search, he found a great many Papers about the
house, and put them into several Bags; and looking into a private Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in his own Chamber, in a place behind the Chimney, he found a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93059:7"/>
Deal Box tacked together with a Nail, with Letters in it, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
into the Custody of one of his Assistants, to take care of it.
And going then into his own Study, he searched his <hi>Scritoire,</hi> and put
up all the Papers he could find, in Bags without any other Papers
among them; sealed them up with his own Seal, keeping them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
in his sight, and so carried every Paper of them to the Clerk of
the Council.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Southwel,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Doleman</hi> were then examined,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Robert Southwel</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Doleman</hi> examined about M. <hi>Colemans</hi> long Letter.</note>
whether or no the Papers then produced in Court, were the Papers
which were brought by Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> the Messenger: And first, Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Southwel,</hi> concerning Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> Long Letter; whose answer
was that he had not seen that large Letter in several days after the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
were brought to him from <hi>Bradley,</hi> remitting the account thereof
to the other Clerks of the Council. Sir <hi>Thomas Doleman,</hi> in answer to
the same question, declared that he found it among Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> Papers
in a Deal Box that <hi>Bradley</hi> brought.</p>
            <p>The next point was to prove both by his own Confession,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Colemans</hi> Letters and Papers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be of his own hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> and by
two Witnesses, that all the Papers in question were of his own hand
writing. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Boatman</hi> (one that had waited upon him
five years in his Chamber) was first examined, who declared, that he
believed all the Papers, then shewed unto him, to be of Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi>
writing; acknowledging further, that a Pacquet of Letters from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas was directed unto him two or three days after he was
made a Prisoner: Confessing also, that he had received a Letter for
his Master from <hi>La Chaise;</hi> but denying that ever he wrote any for his
Master to <hi>La Chaise;</hi> owning also, that his Master kept a large Book of
Entries for his Letters and News: But that he knew not what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of it, and that he had not seen it since two days before his Masters
Commitment. He declared likewise, that he did usually receive News
every Post, but could not say that any Letters of the two years last past
were entred in the aforesaid Book.</p>
            <p>The Prisoner here interposed that all his Letters from the <hi>Hague,
Bruxels, France,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> were before the Council, and that these
were all he had received.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Cattaway</hi> (a kind of an <hi>Amanuensis</hi> to him) was then examined
upon those Papers, who positively affirmed them to be of Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
writing.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> was produced next, to prove the Long Letter<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> proves the long Letter.</note> against
him, upon his own Confession: Who gave Evidence, that he received
the Papers, then shewed him, from Sir <hi>Thomas Doleman,</hi> and that the

most obedient Servant,</hi> (without a name.) And it was read by the Clerk
of the Crown, according to the Order of the Court, but being too
long to be brought into a Breviate, and the whole Letter it self being
little more than the deduction of a three years History of former Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations
(for the greater part with Mr. <hi>Ferrier,</hi> the Predecessor of <hi>La
Chaise</hi>) it will suffice to give this Brief of the whole: Money
was the Prisoners great design, and the procuring of it, by a pretence
of more power, both in the Church, and in the State, than effectually
he had, is in short the drift of that large discourse. Towards the end
of it, he has indeed this bold and dangerous passage; <hi>Our prevailing in
these things would give the greatest blow to the Protestant Religion that ever
it received since its Birth.</hi>

first to procure mony and then by his Interest, as he phansied to himself,
to work a dissolution of the Parliament: so in case of attaining that end,
Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> had by him the Draught of a <hi>Declaration,</hi> as from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
shewing the Reasons of that Dissolution; promising before the

            <p>This is in short the substance of that Voluminous Declaration; and
he did not make more bold with His Majesty in this contrivance, out
of his own head, then he did in another Letter of Mr. <hi>La Chaise,</hi> in the

               <note place="margin">His Letter in the Dukes name, which gave his Highness great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> not only without the order and

to which point Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> deposed the truth of what is here

               </note> which was also to <hi>La

the pinch of the Letter lying in a very narrow compass, we shall

We have a mighty work upon our hands,<note place="margin">Two mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial passages out of it.</note> (<hi>says he</hi>)
no less than the Conversion of three Kingdoms; and by

assistance we can, for the Harvest is Great, and the
Labourers but few.</p>
            <p>This Letter was acknowledged by <hi>Coleman</hi> to be of his own writing
as attested by Sir <hi>Thomas Dolman</hi> and Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> from Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
own Lips.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> owns the Letter.</note> There were read also divers other Letters of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,

            <p>The Prisoner did here crave the leave of the Court to ask Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>
some questions,<note place="margin">The Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner asks the Witness some que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.</note> who (having been withdrawn to rest himself) was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

            <p>Here the Prisoner demanded the particular days of the months, where

answer, that it was within two or three days of the Consult, in <hi>May

adjourned to several Companies, That there were present at it
the <hi>Provincial, Mico, Strange,</hi> and <hi>Keins;</hi> and that the Prisoner came
to the Provincials Chamber two or three days after the Consult. As
to that at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> in <hi>August, Old Stile,</hi> the Witness would not charge
his memory with the particular day, and touching the Consult in <hi>May,</hi>
that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was not present at it; but two or three days after it,
approved at <hi>Wild-house</hi> of the resolutions before taken.</p>
            <p>The Prisoner here suggests that he was fourscore miles off,<note place="margin">The Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner says he was in <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick-shire</hi> when char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be in <hi>London.</hi>

upon the 21. of <hi>August, Old Stile</hi> and so for two or three and
twenty days before, solemnly imprecating himself that he never saw
Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his Face, but in the Council Chamber, and now in the Court,
and that he never saw Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> but now in the Court in his whole
life.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> did also endeavour to evade the danger of two Witnesses,<note place="margin">He pleads that both Witnesses did not swear to the same Fact.</note>
by alledging that they did not both of them swear the self same fact,
which was overruled by shewing that the general fact of killing the King,
was sworn to by both, though not the particular manner, either of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol
or Poyson.</p>
            <p>The Prisoner laboured likewise to extenuate the malice of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,<note place="margin">He blames his expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes upon the word Aid.</note>
by calling them only <hi>Extravagant,</hi> and to expound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
by saying that by the words <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Assistance</hi> was intended
only <hi>Mony</hi> and not <hi>Violence,</hi> and finding that all this did not avail
him, he offered proof that he was in <hi>Warwick-shire</hi> at the time sworn
that he was in <hi>London,</hi> which being allowed him,</p>

            <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was then examined about the time that Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> was sent to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and upon what business; to which Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> answered, that

which the Witness himself saw in the possession of <hi>Grove,</hi> and in the
months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Iune;</hi> and that <hi>Grove</hi> told the Witness that he would
champ his Bullets, that the wound might not be Cured, upon this
Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> suggested that the Witness was at that time actually at
St. <hi>Omers.</hi> But Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> averred that he saw <hi>Grove</hi>'s Bullets twice or
thrice in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Iune,</hi> and <hi>Pickerings</hi> in <hi>August.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Witness was now questioned what he knew of <hi>Pickerings</hi>

told him) for his flint was loose, and he durst not strike for fear of
missing fire, and that for this neglect, he had twenty or thirty strokes:
and <hi>Grove</hi> was censur'd too for looking not better after it. That he
had seen and read this in Letters from <hi>Whitebread,</hi> whose hand he knew
very well.</p>
            <p>The Witness was then ordered to speak to the business of the Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Risque upon his discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Plot.</note>
that were sent to <hi>Windsor,</hi> and how they succeeded; to which,
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> could say little, in regard that at the beginning of <hi>September</hi>
last, one <hi>Bedingfield</hi> had written to <hi>Whitebread</hi> that the Plot was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
and that none but such a one could do it, calling the Witness

by his borrowed name. That this Deponent coming to speak with the
Provincial at his Chamber, <hi>Sept.</hi> 3. the Provincial there shewed and
read <hi>Bedingfields</hi> Letter to the Witness; reproching, striking, and abusing
him; and charging him with a discovery of the Matter to the King:
and asking him with what Face he could come to him thus, after he had
betray'd him. That the Witness was not only reviled, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to depart the Kingdom, but was assalted in his Lodging by <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread,</hi>
and others, who would have killed him if they could.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was called upon next to speak to the Fourscore pounds:

the Provincials Chamber, where it was first signed. That <hi>Mico</hi>

was ready to be said, <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Pickering</hi> did sign it before Mass, and
approved of it, at the Provincials; where they all met that day to
receive the Sacrament; which was delivered in a little Chappel at

which Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> said was a most false lie, he being then in <hi>Staffordshire;</hi>

him as going to St. <hi>Omers</hi> the 12. and the other charging him with being at

so that he offered it as reasonable, that some Witnesses might be brought

Witnesses already to prove that there are more, and naming <hi>Hilsley</hi> for one
that would prove, that when Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> said he came over with him, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>

Letter received that morning, with the copy of an indictment of Perjury
against Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> from the Town of <hi>Hastings,</hi> for which he served, he
sent them to Mr. Atturney, but it being only a Certificate, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
not proceeded upon, and no warrantable Evidence, and neither
for nor against the Prisoners, it was not thought worth a reading. Sir <hi>Denny
Ashburnham</hi>'s information was, that he had known Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> from a child, and
that in his youth he was lookt upon to be a person not much to be confided
in, that being the night before importuned by the Sister of Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> to
give Evidence for the Prisoner, he refused so to do, declaring that he could
not speak any thing to his advantage: for though perhaps having known
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> in youth, he might have suspended in his belief upon Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
his single Testimony, yet finding it so seconded, he was clearly convinced,
and satisfied with the truth of the thing, and he declared farther that he
could say nothing to take off Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> Evidence. That the matter of the
Indictment in question was only Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> swearing the Peace against a man,
and saying that there were Witnesses could prove such a Fact, which they
would not do when they were called.</p>

so only desiring time for more Witnesses, he remitted himself to the
Court.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Groves</hi> said little more than that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> never lay at his House,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Grove</hi> denies that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ever lay at his House.</note>
and that he never saw him take the Sacrament at <hi>Wildhouse,</hi> as he could

never saw Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> there, at her Brothers House (Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> deposing that
he was there in a disguise, and by another name.) The Prisoner concluding
all with these words. <hi>As I have a soul to save, I know nothing of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
charged upon me.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> affirms that he never shot off a Pistol in his life,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Picker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> swears that he was never in Mr. <hi>Bedlows</hi> Company.</note> that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

and pleads that he had no time to summons his Witnesses.</p>
            <p>After the Lord Chief Justice had given his directions to the Jury which

for the Society, <hi>Iohn Gavan,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Turner,</hi> upon an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of High Treason, for a Conspiracy against the Life of the King, the
overturning of the Government, and the destruction of the Protestant
Religion. There was also a Sixth brought to the Barr, one <hi>Iames Corker,</hi>
but upon his Petition to the Court for longer time, in regard that he had
not sufficient notice for the producing of his Witnesses, and the preparing
of his Defences, he was, for the present, set aside.</p>

               </note> Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> represented to the Court,
that having been tri'd on the 17. of <hi>December</hi> last, upon the same Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Jury impannell'd, and the Evidence found insufficient that was
brought in against him, and the Jury discharged without Verdict, he was
informed that no man could be tried, and have his Life put in jeopardy
twice for the same Cause; and therefore made it his Suit, that he might
have Counsell to direct him upon that point in the matter of Law. He
pressed that his Life was in jeopardy, being deliver'd over in Charge
to the Jury; and cited <hi>Sayer</hi>'s Case <hi>Eliz.</hi> 31. who having pleaded to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Indictment for a Burglary, was Indicted a second time; the Judges
declaring that he could not be Indicted again for the same Fact. He desired
a sight of the Record, and to be informed whether or no, being come upon
his Trial, a man ought not to be either Condemned, or Acquitted. Upon
which motion and proposal it was opened unto him,</p>
            <p>That the Jury being discharg'd of him,<note place="margin">His <hi>Plea</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and overrul'd.</note> his Life was in no danger; and
that the Jury being sworn to make true deliverance of the Prisoners in their
Charge, their Charge is not full till the last Charge of the Court, after Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
And farther, that their Plea was not to be supported without a
Record; and moreover that there was no Record of <hi>December</hi> 17. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, for there was no Verdict, because there was no Trial, nor
was it the same Indictment, but contained new matter. Upon which,
Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> submitted himself to the Court.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> offered the same Plea with Mr. <hi>Whitebread,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> pleads the same with Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread.</hi>
               </note> inlarging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon it; That they Two were in the fame danger with the other
Three that suffered, for if Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> (who declared he could say nothing
against them) had given the same Evidence as against the rest, they should
have been likewise Condemned: so that the Evidence falling short, he
supposed that they ought to have been discharged.</p>

others, at his own Chamber, as if he were going to <hi>S. Omers;</hi> and that
he leaving the Town, <hi>Fenwick,</hi> in the other's absence, executed the place

in <hi>England,</hi> and desiring Commissions, and Money, for advancing the

speaks his own knowledge. That Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> delivered this Witness
some money for necessary Expences, charging him to get some Masses said
for the Success of the Undertaking. That <hi>August</hi> 25. after noon, he saw

That <hi>September</hi> 3. the Witness went at night to visit Mr. <hi>Whitebread,</hi>
but could not speak with him, because he was at supper: but that next

he could look him in the face, having done so falsly by him. And that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93059:16"/>
the Witness asking him what injury he had done him; his Answer was,
that the Witness had discovered the business: upon this mistake, that the

Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> was a great man, having a good Tongue, and the faculty of

            <p>That at <hi>Tixall</hi> there was one Meeting about <hi>September</hi> last,<note place="margin">A Meeting at <hi>Tixall Sept.</hi> last, to kill the <hi>King,</hi> and destroy the <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi>

That upon this occasion, the Witness was by Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> chosen to be

and <hi>Gavan</hi> were the first that brake this business to the Witness, Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi>
often perswading and incouraging him to it. The Court appearing to be
much affected with this Evidence, laid great weight upon it, as a thing
wholly <hi>New</hi> to them. Upon which Expression, <hi>Gavan</hi> made an Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in these words, <hi>'Tis so to me too, upon my Soul; for upon my Conscience
I never heard of it before;</hi> bidding the Witness look upon him with Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

any ill thing by him; <hi>Gavan</hi> acknowledged that he had been acquainted
with Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> living within 11 miles of <hi>Tixall,</hi> and conversing
with the Family; and that he knew Mr. <hi>Ewers</hi> very well, but never was
in his Chamber. <hi>Dugdale</hi> proceeded, That some of the discourse already

Chamber. And for a farther Argument of Friendship betwixt them, that
this Witness gave them 400 <hi>li.</hi> to pray for his Soul,<note place="margin">400 <hi>li.</hi> given by the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to pray for his Soul.</note> and to set forward this

for what he had done.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> swears farther,<note place="margin">Forces ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from <hi>abroad.</hi> A <hi>Massacre</hi> intended.</note> that in his hearing they talked as if they
look'd for Forces from abroad; and that Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> said, that though they
were in great Troubles themselves, they would yet have Men and Mony
enough to spare for such a Design. And then, as to a <hi>Massacre,</hi> the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
swears, that he hath heard it talk'd at several Consultations. But they
were first advised by a Letter from <hi>Paris,</hi> that passed through <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s
hands, to make the Death of the King to be a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plot, and in
case of his Miscarriage, to engage the Protestants in a Revenge upon the
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> party, as guilty of the Fact; and after that, to go on to a
<hi>Massacre,</hi> and those that scap'd it to be afterwards cut off by an Army.</p>
            <p>The Witness saith moreover,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>King-Killing</hi> made law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> that Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> hath many times endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to perswade him of the Lawfulness, if not the Merit, of killing any
body for the Advancement of their Religion; giving Reasons for it out of
Scripture, and instancing in the Example of <hi>Garnet,</hi> and the Miracles
wrought by his Reliques.</p>
            <p>He declareth farther,<note place="margin">100 Treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Letters seen by Mr. <hi>D.</hi>

               </note> that the first Intelligence they had in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

came to <hi>Ewers</hi> on the <hi>Monday,</hi> and bore date on the <hi>Saturday</hi> that he

Sir</hi> Edmundbury Godfry <hi>is dispatch'd.</hi> It was not said by whom he was
murthered, but that he was killed, and they knew by whom. Upon the
sight of <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s (or <hi>Harrison</hi>'s) Letters, which were usually sign'd with
<hi>W. H.</hi> which stands for both, this Witness went the next day to an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
hard by, and ask'd if they heard any thing of a Knight thas was
murthered at <hi>London:</hi> And that he had an Evidence in Court for the
truth of what he deliver'd.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was demanded a farther account of <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s Letters

that as he remembred, it was that concerning the Death of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundbury
Godfry</hi> in <hi>October:</hi> and then <hi>Harcourt</hi> affirmed, that he had not
written to him this year and half. Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> now applying himself to
the Prisoner, minded him, that upon Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being last year in the
Country, the Prisoner was used to send the <hi>S. Omers</hi> Letters to Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and so they were dispatch'd down to my Lord <hi>Aston</hi>'s. That the Witness had
the sight of <hi>Eight</hi> of those Letters, by the token, that he pretended to

was told (says Mr. <hi>Sanbridge,</hi>) by a Girl of the house this morning at <hi>Elds,</hi>
that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> had reported such a thing there. This was upon <hi>Tuesday</hi>
morning, and the <hi>Saturday</hi> following the Witness received an account at

none but stout desperate fellows, and that they were to kill the King; <hi>to
take away the King's Life,</hi> in those very words, as the Witness remembreth.
That these Letters were sent by the ordinary Post, and it being <hi>wondred

that he was to have been an Actour, and that they directed their

was to manage the Plot in <hi>Worcestershire:</hi> but that for <hi>Fenwick,</hi> the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
cannot say that ever he saw him before. <hi>Turner,</hi> on the other side,

Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> told him, that my Lords <hi>Bellasis, Powis,</hi> and <hi>Arundel</hi> should
command them: and that <hi>Grove</hi> afterwards told the Witness, the aforesaid
Lords had Commissions to give places. The Witness deposeth farther, that
asking Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> what would become of Trades-men, if we should come
to have Wars; he bad the Witness never fear want of Trade, for there
would be Church-work enough for Images, Crucifixes, and the like.
That the Witness going to Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chamber, after Father <hi>Iames</hi> (his
Ghostly Father) was dead, Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> would have had the Witness come
to Confession to him. (This was about a week before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> last.)
Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> denying all, the Witness minded him of a Table for the Altar

            <p>Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> asking the Witness if ever he had discoursed with him about

he never saw him more then twice, before that time in the Court, and once
before the Councill. Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> informed the Court, that he had got 8

had disappointed him of his Witnesses. Proceeding, that he had brought

found the Letters enclosed addressed to other persons, to whom he
sent them, the outside Cover being onely directed to him. This was the
first time the Prisoner ever saw him; and the second was, when he came
afterwards to his Chamber, lamenting his Condition, that he was newly
turn'd Catholick, and had lost his Friends, when the Prisoner lent him
20 <hi>s.</hi> upon his promise of repaying it, but never saw him after, till lately
at the Privy Councill. This was about four years since. Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,

he could not properly produce his Witnesses before the Trial of the Lords;

The Witness saith farther,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Plot.</note> That the Consult which he carried to <hi>S. Omers</hi>
he had from Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> to whom Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> went with him, and in
that Consult was the Main of the Design; and that he was also presented
by Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> to the Lord <hi>Arundell,</hi> who promised him great matters
when the Times were come about. <hi>Harcourt</hi> interjecting, that <hi>he spake not
one true word;</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> demanded of the Prisoner, if in <hi>August</hi> or <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
last he was not in company with <hi>Le Faire,</hi> or <hi>Le Fevre.</hi> To which
Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> said, he knew no <hi>Le Faire,</hi> but <hi>Le Fevre</hi> he did; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
that he saw him then, but never since. And the Witness went on,
that <hi>Pritchard</hi> recommended him to him, as a person tri'd and trusty, and
fit to be taken into the privacy of the Design; <hi>Pritchard</hi> declaring to the
Witness in their presence, that the Death of the King was one part of it.
And the Witness says farther, that going another time from <hi>Pritchard</hi> to
<hi>Harcourt,</hi> he saw <hi>Harcourt</hi> give Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> a Bill of Exchange up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the mony. And that Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> told Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> upon
delivering the Bill, that <hi>That 2000 li. was in part of a greater summe.</hi> Sir

desired he might name the Citizen upon whom it was drawn; for it
would then be found upon the Merchant's book. <hi>Fenwick</hi> urg'd, that it
was not enough to averr that he saw a Bill of Exchange, if he cannot say
from whom it came, and to whom it was directed. But the Court found
that to be of little moment, Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> himself not being concerned in

Court, that this Letter was written to one that had a Vote in the Meeting,
which by the Order of the Society is to assemble once in Three years, and
advise about their particular Affairs: that the chief business was about the
Choice of a Procurator to be dispatch'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein Secrecy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
because it was dangerous to have it known. As to the Caution
of not hastening before the time, or being too publick, for fear the Design
should be suspected, wherein Secrecy was naturally necessary; Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread</hi>
expounded it, that the Design was the getting of a Congregation,
which it was prudential to keep secret, as a thing not permitted in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
declaring upon his Salvation, that there was no other Reason for the
enjoyning of that Secrecy: offering farther, that it would be very hard to
take away mens lives upon a word, that may as well bear one Construction
as another: instancing in the usual way of speech, <hi>I have a design to dine
here or there tomorrow,</hi> where the word <hi>design</hi> is properly enough made use
of. It was returned upon them, that the word <hi>Design,</hi> with a Caution of
<hi>Privacy,</hi> and the Business being matter of <hi>Secrecy in its own nature,</hi> must
necessarily imply something of greater consequence then the Election of an
Officer.</p>

the word <hi>Design</hi> to the great Concernment of both Worlds, which
was the subject matter of this Meeting: declaring, upon his Salvation, that
though he was not at this Consult himself, yet he believed that which he
had delivered was the true and onely Cause of their Meeting: adding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
that it being in time of the Parliament Sitting, <hi>Secrecy</hi> was <hi>necessary,</hi>
that they might not give offence; and that it concerned them not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of, when their Lives depended upon the Discovery. That the

            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> objected, that though they justify the Consult now, yet when

Consult. At which <hi>Fenwick</hi> disown'd the Denial of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> declared, That whereas Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> says, that their desire of
Secrecy was out of a Respect to the Parliament,<note place="margin">Papists bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament-time then out of it.</note> he and others had been

                  <p>I know not from whence it proceeds,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anderton's</hi> Letter.</note> but I perceive that both your Letters
and mine have bad fortune by the way; for my Correspondents with you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
they hear not from me, whereas I write constantly intire Pacquets, and
since the Bills I received from your self for Sir <hi>William Goring,</hi> and for Mr.
<hi>Ireland,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Shelly,</hi> I have not had one Letter but what I received this
week; which in part made recompence for the former, for it brought me three
of yours, and one of Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s, for which I render you many humble thanks,
and acknowledge the fifteen pounds from my Lord <hi>Castlemain,</hi> though Mr.
<hi>Ireland</hi> made no mention of it in his. We are all here very glad of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of Mr. <hi>Thomas Harcourt.</hi> When I writ that the <hi>Patents</hi> were sent,
although I guess for whom they were, yet I know not for certain, because our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
do not use to discover things or resolutions till they know they have effect.
And therefore in these kind of matters I dare not be too hasty, lest some will say,
<hi>A fool's Bolt is soon shot.</hi>

            <p>There arose a great difficulty upon the plurality of the word <hi>Patents.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A dispute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word <hi>Patents.</hi>
               </note>
Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> expounded it to be meant of his Patent for Provinciall;
which being but one, would not have been called Patents. Which Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread</hi>
qualified by making it a <hi>Latinism,</hi> and called it <hi>Literae patentes.</hi> It was
objected, that he being made Provincial <hi>Ianuary</hi> 14. and this bearing date
<hi>Feb.</hi> 5. the word <hi>Patents</hi> could not be intended of his Commission. To
which M. <hi>Whitebread</hi> answers, that possibly they did not know till then; and
that it was not known what Exceptions might be exhibited against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
named: besides, that every Patent is called <hi>Literae patentes.</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
affirmed, that if a man be chosen to a place, he must execute it, upon pain of
Damnation if he disobey his Superiour. To which Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> replied,
that a hundred Instances might be given of Refusalls in the case; and that
he would have refused it himself, if he had foreseen the Trouble of it; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
to Almighty God, as he was to answer at the last day, that he knew
nothing at all of this business. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> declared that the Patents spoken
of in this Letter were sent, a great many of them, in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> before.</p>
            <p>The Prisoners being now called to their Defence, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Witnesses
were sent for, to be in readiness.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> beginning,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; with Reflections upon the Witnesse.</note> that though he did not fear Death, he would be
loth to die by Injustice: and that he hop'd that he should be allow'd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
freedome of endeavouring to preserve himself; for that a man's Life
might be taken away by Perjury, as well as by a Pistoll: so that he trusted
that no man should be admitted as an Evidence against him, that was not <hi>probus
Testis;</hi> offering that D. <hi>Oates</hi> was not such a man, and he craved leave to say
that he was <hi>Perjured.</hi> He says that he did such and such things by <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s
appointment, was present with him <hi>April</hi> 24. and that the Prisoner acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> with the whole design: a thing so improbable, that whoever
believes it must take the Prisoner for a Mad-man, to trust any body with
such a concern at first sight; (for he confesseth that so it was;) and then to
trust a man that had his Livelyhood from the Society, (for they maintain'd
him,) that is to say, first the Prisoner's Predecessor, and then himself. Upon
his Importunity to be entertain'd in the Society, the Prisoner perswaded
him to withdraw, reflecting upon him as a person not answerable to the
purpose he pretended to; and that for severall Reasons. First, for his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
for he held severall Opinions that were not sound. Secondly, his
Life was loose, and therefore he was desired to retire. To which end, he
had a suit of Cloaths given him, a Periwigg, and 4 <hi>li.</hi> in his Pocket, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93059:20"/>
he promised to repay upon the fale of his Library in <hi>London;</hi> but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did. The Prisoner took notice of the just Wonder of the Court at wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to <hi>Dugdale</hi> by the Post in so plain and dangerous terms; and the like
in his discourse to Dr. <hi>Oates:</hi> but concluded in craving the Court's leave
to produce Witnesses, that from the 10. of <hi>Decem.</hi> to the 23. of <hi>Iune</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was at <hi>S. Omers,</hi> and lodg'd but one night out of the
house.</p>
            <p>It was observed upon Mr. <hi>Whitebread,</hi> as a strange thing, that they should
still maintain a man that they had so ill an opinion of: but Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi>
denied the maintaining of him, affirming, that he was not sent over by them,
as he said he was, and undertaking to prove it: allowing all this while that
they had maintained him before; and distinguishing betwixt an office of
Charity to a man of Letters, and in necessity, and a Confidence of Intrigue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him in such a Case as this.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> then recommended it to the Court to consider,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Defence.</note> that Dr.
<hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence from one end to the other was supported by the sight of
such and such Letters from one person or another; and all the Testimony is,
the sight of the Letters: as if <hi>Fenwick,</hi> that knew Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from <hi>S. Omers</hi> for his Misdemeanors, should after that make him privy
to all his Letters. The Prisoner desired the Court to take notice, that he
had a thousand Letters taken from him, and not one Syllable either of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or of solliciting people to come over, was charged upon him out of
those Letters. Urging, that all the proof made was but <hi>saying</hi> and <hi>swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;</hi>
and defying any man to make out any probability to any unbyassed
judgement, how this could possibly be. Here the Prisoners were min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that there is no other Evidence to be given, then by <hi>saying</hi> and <hi>swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
Fenwick</hi> pursued his discourse, declaring, that he did no more think
of his being taken or accused, then of his death; and that he removed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and that besides Letters, there were seized in Bonds and Bills to the
value of five or six thousand pounds; and it seems strange, that out of all
this there should nothing of a design appear. <hi>For God's sake</hi> (said the
Prisoner) <hi>where are the Commissions sign'd? and the moneys paid?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hilsley</hi> being presented to the Court as a Witness on the behalf of
the Prisoners,<note place="margin">The Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners beg that their Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses may be sworn.</note> Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> begs that their Witnesses might be sworn:
which though it would not be granted, because it was against the King;
yet the Jury were directed to value the Testimony according to the credit
of the Persons, and the Matter in question. Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> offered that there
was no positive Law; and the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his Institutes says, that there
is not so much as <hi>Scintilla Iuris</hi> against it. But this being against constant
Usage and Custome, it could not be granted.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> shews,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> with falsify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> that in Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Triall, <hi>pag.</hi> 35 and 36, Dr.
<hi>Oates</hi> declares that he came from <hi>S. Omers</hi> with Sir <hi>Iohn Warner,</hi> Father
<hi>Williams,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hilsley:</hi> but it was answered, that printed Trialls are no
Evidence; there may be <hi>Errata's</hi> in them. Then Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> asked Dr.
<hi>Oates,</hi> if he did not acknowledge that he came over with <hi>Hilsley:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Presses the business of <hi>Hilsley.</hi>
               </note> and Dr.
<hi>Oates</hi> told him, that to any question of that day, if the Court thought it
reasonable, he would give an Answer. <hi>Fenwick</hi> insisted upon it, that Dr.
<hi>Oates</hi> was forsworn in affirming he did; but not being convict, that could
not be prest: so that <hi>Fenwick</hi> offered to prove his affirmation by Witnesses,
that heard it; asking Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> again, if he came over with <hi>Hilsley.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> clears the Objection.</note> To
which Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> made answer, that to put them out of their pain, as he
said Then, so he said Now, that <hi>One Hilsley</hi> did come over with him.
To which <hi>Hilsley</hi> answered, that he did not, for he left him at <hi>S. Omers.</hi>
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> acknowledged that <hi>Hilsley</hi> left him at <hi>S. Omers,</hi> but that he came
away a day after him, and overtook him at <hi>Calais. Hilsley</hi> denied it, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93059:21"/>
there were a great many there that could prove the contrary.
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> informed the Court, that <hi>Hilsley</hi> lost his mony at <hi>Calais,</hi> and
that he prevailed with Father <hi>Williams</hi> to relieve him. <hi>Hilsley</hi> confess'd
the loss of his mony, but utterly denied that ever Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and he were
in a Ship together. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> urged, that he might be Examined if he
were not in Orders: but it was not thought reasonable to press him to
accuse himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hilsley</hi> offers Witnesses to make out that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was in <hi>S. Omers</hi> the
day after <hi>Hilsley</hi> came out,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hilsley</hi> offers Proofs on the Prisoners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</note> and several weeks after. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> swears that
<hi>Hilsley</hi> left them upon the way, and did not come throughout with them to
<hi>London. Hilsley</hi> says that he believes Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was told of his losing his
mony by one that was with him the second of <hi>May,</hi> and that there was one
in Court who (he supposed) could speak to't.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>William Parry</hi> offered then to swear,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Parry</hi> crosses Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony.</note> that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was at <hi>S. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
upon that day when he affirms he came over, that is, that he was
there upon the 25; that he stirr'd not from thence that day; that the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
din'd with him, and he went into the <hi>Infirmary,</hi> for he was sick; that
he was at <hi>S. Omers</hi> till after the 20. of <hi>Iune,</hi> by the token that he was
there at a Play upon the 20. day. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> denied the business of the
<hi>Infirmary,</hi> and offered to make appear to the Court, that <hi>Hilsley</hi> had been
several years of the <hi>Sodality</hi> of the <hi>Iesuits;</hi> and that they dare not but say
what their Superiours bid them.</p>
            <p>As to the 20. of <hi>Iune,</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> averrs that he was at <hi>S. Omers</hi> at that
Action,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> sticks to his affirmation.</note> but affirms that he was then come back again from <hi>London. Parry</hi>
on the other side denied that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ever went out of the Colledge;
for that he constantly din'd and supp'd with him, saving 3 or 4 days when
he was in the <hi>Infirmary,</hi> where he entred <hi>April</hi> the 25. <hi>old stile.</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
advertised the Court of a Contradiction in the Prisoner's Evidence, upon
the difference between <hi>old stile</hi> and <hi>new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Parry</hi> affirms that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> came to <hi>S. Omers</hi> in <hi>December,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Parry</hi> for the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> and
went not out from the Colledge till the end of <hi>Iune,</hi> and that onely to
<hi>Watton,</hi> for two days and a night; and that he is confident of what he
says; for a Scholar never removes from thence to <hi>England,</hi> but 'tis the talk
of the whole Colledge. And then (says Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi>) they goe away in
Secular Garments, that no notice may be taken of their leaving the place.
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> admitted this as a general Rule, but that his case was a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Exception to that Rule; and that he resum'd the Habit of the House
upon his coming back to <hi>London,</hi> and appear'd as one of it still, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it was taken notice of that he had been out, having never shewed
himself in the Colledge in a Lay-Habit. Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> followed it, that
let his Cloaths be what they would, his place and seniority was the same,
so that at Meals he was visible to the whole House.</p>
            <p>There stood up for the Prisoners one Mr. <hi>Doddington,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> for Prisoners.</note> (another Witness)
that passed at <hi>S. Omers</hi> by the name of <hi>Hollis,</hi> betwixt 18 and 19 years of
age, who gave this Account of Dr. <hi>Oates:</hi> That he entred the Colledge
about a fortnight before <hi>Christmas,</hi> and betwixt <hi>that</hi> and <hi>Iune</hi> was never
out, but one night at <hi>Watton.</hi> That he saw him at least every other day,
and in particular the day after <hi>Hilsley</hi> departed, which was <hi>April 24. new

that he saw him in the Garden, upon the 2. of <hi>May,</hi> with one <hi>Blood</hi> or
<hi>Burnaby.</hi> This Witness came into <hi>England</hi> in <hi>April</hi> last, about two
months since, in part upon the Proclamation for recalling such as were in
Seminaries, and partly for want of Health.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gifford</hi> was next Examined,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Gifford</hi> for the Pris.</note> who declared that he came from <hi>S. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93059:21"/>
that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was at <hi>S. Omers</hi> when he said he was here. He affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that he saw him <hi>May-day was twelvemonth</hi> and <hi>April</hi> 21. at <hi>S. Omers,</hi>
and kept him company the whole week after. That he remembers the <hi>first</hi>
of <hi>May,</hi> by the token that one Mr. <hi>Burnaby</hi> coming that day to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> made an acquaintance with him, and this Witness saw them
together; and at the Colledge-hour of Recreation, for a week at least, he
came every day after dinner. That he was not in the <hi>Infirmary</hi> till the
day after <hi>Hilsley</hi> was gone away, continuing there about three days; and
from that time till <hi>Iune</hi> at least, <hi>Gifford</hi> solemnly averrs that he saw him at
least every other day, for he never was out all that time, but one night at
<hi>Watton,</hi> for his Relaxation. And he could not but be taken notice of:
for though there were a matter of 150 that eat all in the same Room; yet
he sitting at a Table apart, betwixt the Religious and the Youths, could
not chuse but be taken notice of.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> stood up next;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> for the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> who inform'd, that he came from <hi>S. Omers</hi>
2 or 3 months since, and that he came because he car'd not for staying any
longer: that his Father lives by <hi>Windsor:</hi> that he saw Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> on <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
new stile,</hi> by the token that there were Strangers that day; and that
the Witness saw him in the afternoon playing with the other Boys at Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins.
(They call all those Boys that are not of the Religious: And though
he sate at a Table distinct, yet going to School, he was still reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Boys.) The Witness saw him the next day with Mr. <hi>Burnaby,</hi>
and it was wondred at, his thrusting himself into his company, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen him before, as Mr. <hi>Burnaby</hi> said himself. That the Witness saw
him also at the Action; and also with Mr. <hi>Killingbeck</hi> on the 5. of <hi>May,</hi>
who was then departing; and likewise with Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> at his going away.
That the 11. day, at a Play, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> would needs sit in the place of the
Musick, and one Mr. <hi>Watson</hi> quarrelled with him. Seeing him also betwixt
these times, and so from time to time, till <hi>Iune</hi> following.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cox</hi> informed,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cox.</hi>
               </note> that he came away from <hi>S. Omers</hi> in <hi>November</hi> after
Dr. <hi>Oates:</hi> that he knew Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> very well, and saw him at <hi>S. Omers</hi> at
the time when he affirms that he was in <hi>England;</hi> for he was often with
Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> when he was sick, which Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> was the Witnesse's Musick-Master.
That he went away in <hi>Iuly,</hi> and never stirr'd from <hi>S. Omers</hi> till
he went quite away. That the Witness was there also till Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> went,
which was after the Consult of the Jesuits, which he affirms to have been
in <hi>April,</hi> and himself to have been at. The Witnesse's jumbling of the
Months caused the people to laugh: and the Witness still persisted, that
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was at <hi>S. Omers</hi> till the Jesuits Consult was over. He informed
that he came thither, and was onely one night out of the House, at <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
all the time he was there. That he did not goe away with Mr. <hi>Hilsley,</hi>
for a Gent. that was going that day for <hi>England,</hi> being loth to rise, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
told a story of him how loth he was to leave his bed, which was the day
after <hi>Hisley</hi> went away. The other Gent. went upon the 5. of <hi>May,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nevil,</hi> who he says were with him in <hi>England,</hi> were
neither of them absent at that time. That Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was at <hi>S. Omers</hi> all

from <hi>December</hi> till about the end of <hi>Iune.</hi> That he was there all
<hi>May,</hi> and could not be 8 days in <hi>England,</hi> as he says; for being entred
into the Sodality <hi>March</hi> 25. he was appointed to read at six a clock every

he went away: for he was never sick on a <hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> but somewhat

did not charge him as sitting in the Consult, but as seeing his Hand to it
afterwards: representing, that onely a profest <hi>Iesuit</hi> has a Right of sitting
there, (which as then he was not.) The Prisoner insists upon a Witness
that he has, to prove, that at that time he was at <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> in <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire.</hi>
Being told that it was his Hand to the Consult, not his being
present at it, that was charg'd upon him: <hi>Gavan</hi> replied, that he could
not sign it at <hi>London,</hi> unless he were at <hi>London;</hi> and so he offered to
prove himself at <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> the <hi>four</hi> and the <hi>five and twentieth of
April.</hi> But Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> swearing that it was in <hi>Iune,</hi> or <hi>Iuly,</hi> that he saw
Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi>'s hand to the Consult, it was considered, that it might be sign'd
at any time during that Intervall; and so the proving Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> at <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verhampton</hi>
the <hi>four or five and twentieth of April</hi> would doe him no

and so to the 23. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> when he went to another Lodging in the Town,
more convenient for his turn. The Witness said, that he was never from
thence in all that time, and that he sojourn'd longer with her, but she
onely speaks to the Months in question. That after he went, she seldom
failed a day of seeing him: and that she was a <hi>Roman Catholick.</hi>

that being a Servant to Mrs. <hi>Winford</hi> at <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> she saw

<hi>Iune.</hi> It was asked her why she stuck more at <hi>May</hi> then the other <hi>Months:</hi>
and her Answer was, that any body might mistake. She own'd her self
likewise to be a <hi>Roman Catholick.</hi>

to mind at the time when he went from her. To which she answered,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93059:23"/>
That not knowing what she should be examined upon, she could not well
recollect her self; but that he went often abroad to my Lord <hi>Aston</hi>'s: that
she knew not how long he stay'd there, but that she was confident that he
did not goe to <hi>London,</hi> for he had no Linen with him then, as he had
when he used to goe a Journey. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> suggested to the Court, that
he took a Chamber to goe into the Exercise, and that under that pretence
he might slip to <hi>London</hi> and no body the nearer, because upon that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they are close shut up. To which Mrs. <hi>Winford</hi> answered, that she
knew nothing of it, but upon any urgent business people are then admitted
to see them; and that she her self could speak it upon her own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and that about the end of <hi>Iuly</hi> she went often to him after he had
left her Lodgings. That the former part of <hi>Iuly</hi> he was in the Witnesse's
house, from whence he went upon the 23. That he was not shut up in the
Witnesse's house, and that the last <hi>Eight days</hi> she was allowed to come to
him: not but that he was shut up, but still upon business, either of
bringing any thing, or speaking with him, there was admittance to him.
Touching the point of his having time enough to be at <hi>London,</hi> and back
again, while she did not see him; the Witness declared that she thought
he had not; but that she was confident that he did not go. But it was
observed upon her, that she had said, peradventure he might be away
5 or 6 days; but she still persisted, that she was confident he had not been
at <hi>London</hi> in the <hi>Interim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> then prest the Court for liberty of speech, and urged it, that
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> charged him <hi>directly</hi> to have been in Town in <hi>Iuly,</hi> and that he
met the Prisoner with Mr. <hi>Ashby,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> contradicts Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence, as to his speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Mr. <hi>Ashby.</hi>
               </note> who was then in Town; so that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner's
being in Town must be betwixt Mr. <hi>Ashby's</hi> coming to Town, and
his going out again; which he computed to be a fortnight's time. The
Prisoner reasoning the point, in such sort, that if he could make it out that
he was in <hi>Staffordshire</hi> from the 15. or 16. of <hi>Iuly</hi> to the end of the <hi>month,</hi>
he had then acquitted himself. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> makes it to be either the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
or <hi>Middle</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> that Mr. <hi>Ashby</hi> came to <hi>Town,</hi> but does not swear
which; onely he rather inclines to think it was the <hi>Middle:</hi> and while
Mr. <hi>Ashby</hi> was here, Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> came up, and told the Witness that he
would go visit Mr. <hi>Ashby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> having given Evidence where he was at the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> was
now called upon to prove where he was at the <hi>beginning</hi> of the month.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> proves what he could; and swears himself Innocent as to the rest.</note>
But he told the Court that his Witnesses were not here; and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
himself to the Court to this effect: That being Innocent, it was
not possible for him to imagine upon what point they would accuse him;
but yet he cast his thoughts every way, to see where he was most liable,
and what he had ever done that might yield the most plausible pretence for
a Charge: and that finding nothing so colourable as his being engaged at
that <hi>April Consult,</hi> the Prisoner had provided himself at his own Expence
with Witnesses to clear that matter. And now having discharged himself,
by the use of all prudential means for his Clearing, and having done it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
as to the 24. of <hi>April,</hi> upon which the main pretension of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy was founded; he cast himself with all submission upon the Honour
and Justice of the Court, offering proofs that he was not in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust;</hi>
protesting solemnly, and upon his Salvation, that he was not in
<hi>London;</hi> and imprecating upon himself most Exemplary Judgments from
Almighty God, if he were not Innocent.</p>
            <p>After this, he offered himself to the Court to pass the <hi>Ordeal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He offers himself to the <hi>Ordeal.</hi>
               </note> as a Test

            <p>Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> offered in his defence, that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> failing in his Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

it came in his head as he was in bed, that this was <hi>Titus Oates:</hi> so that he
went next morning to enquire of him at a place where he had seen him a
year before; and the Woman of the house cry'd out that <hi>he was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done

Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> being then in the Court-yard, and the Witness in the Kitchin.

The Witness then asked what he was: and he answered, he had been a

came with him, and they walk'd into the Garden. That the Ladies of
the house being shy of them, hearing he was turn'd <hi>Iesuite,</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi>
seemed discontented, that he had not so much Respect now in the house as
formerly. That Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> afterwards going into the Garden, Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>'s

in Evidence, returning out of the Country, he was told that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
had been at his house in a Disguise, as if he were either a <hi>Quaker,</hi> or a
<hi>Papist:</hi> nay, that they told the Witness of two Disguises, the one in
short Hair, the other in a long Perriwigg: and that his Coachman, then
in Court, told him of it first. That the Witness falling sick in that <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was gone; but came to his house after his Recovery, to
ask for Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> about the latter end of <hi>Iune,</hi> or beginning of <hi>Iuly.</hi>
That the Witness had known him from a Child, and saw him the last Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
but not till <hi>Iune;</hi> and that in <hi>Iune</hi> (as he remembred) he did see
him: but that his Servants had seen him, as they themselves told him,

            <p>One <hi>Butler</hi> was sworn, and informed, that he had three years know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> came in, and enquired for Dr. <hi>Tongue.</hi> The Witness telling
him that he was not within; he seem'd much discontented, but yet went
into the house, and presently out again, and away. He was in gray
cloaths like a Shepherd, and his Hair cropt to his ears; but yet the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
knew him so soon as he saw him. That the Witness saw him
some six weeks after, in a long black Coat and Perriwigg. That he
was sure it was Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and that he told his Master of it soon
after.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was sworn, and informed, that he knew Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> (being
Usher of <hi>Merchant-Taylors School,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> his Scholar there.)

discourse was about his Travells, and nothing at all about the Times.
That he knew he had chang'd his Religion; and that he saw him not in

there the second time in <hi>May</hi> also; but the day he could not say; nor
whether he saw him afterwards or not: but that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> in Court was
the person he saw there. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> offering to the court, that Mr. <hi>Clay</hi>
was a Priest in Orders: but that question was not put to him; onely he

name any one that he had seen in Town, he could not name any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
And so likewise afterwards, at the Committee, he told that the
Prisoner lay privately at <hi>Grove</hi>'s; and the Prisoner can prove that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lay there at all: and then he was positive, that he stay'd here but <hi>six
days,</hi> and saw little company. Now the Evidence affirms, that at the <hi>end</hi>
of <hi>March,</hi> or the <hi>middle</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> he saw him here: and yet Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
himself declares, that he passed the Sea with <hi>Hilsley,</hi> the twenty fourth of
<hi>April.</hi> If he landed in <hi>England</hi> the seventeenth of <hi>April,</hi> as is said, and
continued here a good part of <hi>May,</hi> how can this stand with his being in
<hi>England</hi> but <hi>six days?</hi> The Prisoners were answered, that the precise
day was not so punctually sworn to: so that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> might be seen here
the <hi>latter end</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and the <hi>beginning</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and yet his Testimony
stand good.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> offered to the Court,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> summs up his whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: insis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the Incompeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of things; and their Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements among themselves.</note> that the Evidence against them spake
onely to one or two particular days; one to his Dining with him, and
another to his Disguise: and that in the very Evidence there was a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
Contradiction; for he could not come over with <hi>Hilsley,</hi> as he said he
did, and appear here in <hi>May,</hi> and all this within six days. That it might
be farther considered also, the disproportion in the Number of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
sixteen for the Prisoners, and such as conversed with Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
every day. Or allowing that a less Number for the King should weigh
down a greater Number on the part of the Prisoners, the Exception to
his Evidence about the <hi>Rectour of Liege,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Warner,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Preston,</hi> remains yet untouch'd. Or supposing a Mistake in what
concerns Dr. <hi>Oate</hi>'s being at <hi>S. Omers,</hi> there are yet <hi>six</hi> that prove he has
sworn false. And the Prisoner humbly represented, that no body ought
to be condemned but upon two sufficient Witnesses. And after all, that
Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was prov'd to have been out of <hi>London,</hi> from <hi>August</hi> 3. to
<hi>September</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by at least 16 <hi>Staffordshire</hi> Witnesses. Which two points
remain without Answer: for Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> says that he was with him here
<hi>August</hi> 12. when they agree that he was in <hi>Staffordshire.</hi> As to the Maid,
she onely says that she <hi>saw</hi> him, without <hi>speaking</hi> to him. The Prisoner
here appealing to the Honour and Conscience of the Court, how far to
believe a Witness that hath even in one point falsify'd. And then there
is Sir <hi>Iohn Southcott,</hi> and <hi>his Family,</hi> that give an account of Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>
in the Country from <hi>August</hi> 5. to the 19. (which was after the precise
day that the Maid speaks of in <hi>London.</hi> There are <hi>seven</hi> or <hi>eight</hi> of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93059:26"/>
them that agree upon the seeing of him from the <hi>first</hi> day to the
<hi>last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas it is objected in the business of <hi>Iuly,</hi> that the Prisoner's Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
speak positively onely to the <hi>last week;</hi> the Prisoner offers, that they
rather incline to think him there the other weeks also then not; and
that being shut up in the Last, they took a more particular notice of
him.</p>
            <p>He minded the Court also of the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Ashby</hi>'s coming to
Town about <hi>Mid-Iuly,</hi> and of the Prisoner's coming likewise within the
fortnight which Mr. <hi>Ashby</hi> staid; and of the Prisoner's saying he would
wait upon Father <hi>Ashby;</hi> where the discourse past that he speaks of: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that he is neither <hi>prov'd</hi> to have been at the <hi>Great Consult,</hi> nor <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi>
of it; appealing to Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> and the <hi>rest,</hi> whether he were there
or not, and upon the word of a dying man denying it.</p>
            <p>As to the Prisoner's name being to it, (which is laid in <hi>Iuly</hi>) he
proves himself in <hi>Staffordshire</hi> the <hi>last Week</hi> of that Month, and has Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of being there till the 14. and the <hi>last Week;</hi> which he hoped
would be considered.</p>
            <p>He mov'd farther, whether standing accused by one Witness, about
one Fact in <hi>London,</hi> and by another, concerning another Fact in <hi>Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
these two Witnesses are to be reckoned good in Law. But this
being already resolved in Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s Case, where severall Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
prov'd severall Facts in severall Countries, and yet all overt Acts
of one and the same Treason; Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> suggested, that Serjeant <hi>Rolls</hi>
was of another Opinion.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi>'s second Plea was grounded upon the Circumstances of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Witnesses,</hi> and of <hi>Clear Evidence;</hi> but that in his Case there was
neither the one, nor the other; and therefore that he ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
by such a Witness, and upon such an Evidence. Wherein the
Court informed him, that they were <hi>Lawfull Witnesses,</hi> because not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict
of any crime to destroy their Testimony: and for the <hi>Credibility</hi> of
them, that was left to the <hi>Iury.</hi> Whereupon the Prisoner addressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the <hi>Iury</hi> to this following effect.</p>
            <p>That his Life was in their hands:<note place="margin">His application to the <hi>Iury.</hi>
               </note> That he was not at the Consult,
nor of age to be there: That to the making of a <hi>Credible Witness,</hi> there
must be <hi>Integrity of Life,</hi> and <hi>Truth of Testimony:</hi>
               <note place="margin">He urges the Insufficiency of D. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Testimony.</note> That Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was

Sir <hi>Thomas Preston's,</hi> and the business of Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being here
<hi>August</hi> 12. he is unanswerably disporv'd: And that though he be not
convicted of Perjury, he might have been; so that there was enough
before them to shake his Testimony. And then in Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s business,
betwixt <hi>August</hi> 8. and 12. how many Proofs of his being in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi>
to one Woman that says she saw him in Town? Sixteen Witnesses that
were daily in his company that affirm'd the contrary. He inculcated
over again the business of the <hi>S. Omers</hi> Witnesses; sixteen, to three or
four: the Contradiction of Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> his coming over with <hi>Hilsley,</hi> and
staying but six days; with the Evidence that saw him in Town <hi>April</hi>
and <hi>May;</hi> his being at <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> from <hi>Iuly</hi> 16. upwards.</p>

beggerly sort of people, that might be drawn in to mend their fortunes by
their Evidence. His Testimony then is false as to Sir <hi>Iohn Warner,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Preston;</hi> for they came not over with him.
Or suppose the Witnesses to be Equal, what support has he for his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?
such and such Letters he pretends from Mr. <hi>Whitebread;</hi> which if
it were true, the Prisoners deserved to be hang'd for <hi>Fools,</hi> as well as for
<hi>Knaves,</hi> for trusting a Creature that they never had any Esteem for, and
who was Expelled the Colledge.</p>
            <p>And then for the Commissions and Letters he speaks of,<note place="margin">Thousands of Letters seiz'd, and no Treason in them: nor One Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission found in all their Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> 'tis almost a
year that this Discovery hath been afoot, and thousands of Letters seiz'd:
and yet not one Commission appears; not one penny of mony, or any
order for it; no Arms found; nor out of all these Letters any thing
discovered towards this <hi>Design.</hi> And for all the Writings signed, which
he says were hundreds, from one Consult to another, there is not one
single paper produced in confirmation of it. Ending in these words, There
is no Reason brought among them all, but <hi>Saying</hi> and <hi>Swearing;</hi> and that
I'll stand by.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> told the Court and Jury,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread</hi> offers to the <hi>Iury</hi> how he should dare to strike Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> if he had his Life at his mercy.</note> that whereas Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> charg'd
him with <hi>beating of him; First,</hi> the Prisoner neither was, nor ever had
been a Fighting man: and he appeal'd to their Considerations, how he
should dare to strike a person, whom he had made privy to so Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a Secret. Reflecting then upon the strangeness of the thing, that so
many Eminent persons should be concerned in it, the Plot discovered,
and yet no footsteps of it appear. And so he recommended himself to God,
and the Jury.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> then declared, that being now arrived at <hi>Seventy years
of age,</hi> this was the first time in his whole Life that he had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
before a Magistrate: But that a Negative cannot be proved;
and that there was no Evidence against them, but downright <hi>Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> was about to pass a Reflection upon the Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
of the Witnesses; but bringing no proof, he put an end to the
discourse.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> being demanded what he had to say, he did ask, if it were
reasonable to admit of those people to an <hi>Oath</hi> in <hi>Evidence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> excepted to Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence.</note> who for
Scandall were debarr'd the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> as he would prove by one <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings.</hi>
But he being called, and not appearing, the Court proceeded to
give directions to the Jury: wherein the Evidences were so fully and
distinctly summ'd up by my Lord Chief Justice, that there was nothing to
be added to them.</p>
            <p>

The Jury were then sent out to consider of their Verdict;<note place="margin">All the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners found guilty.</note> and after

            <p>UPON <hi>Iune</hi> 14. 1679. Mr. <hi>Richard Langhorn</hi> was brought to his
Trial<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> brought to his Trial.</note> at the <hi>Sessions-house</hi> in the <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> according to an Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the day before; standing Indicted of <hi>High Treason,</hi> for
contriving the <hi>Death of the King,</hi> the Subversion of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi>
and of the <hi>Establisht Government.</hi> He pleaded <hi>Not guilty</hi> to the Indictment.
The Jury was sworn without any Challenge. The King's Councell open'd
the Charge, and so the Court entred upon the Trial; beginning with some
Evidences upon the main Design.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> were both sworn:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> swears to the <hi>General Plot.</hi>
               </note> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> spake first
to the Plot upon the <hi>Life of the King;</hi> declaring, that he himself had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in divers Consultations for the Destruction of His Majesty, and of the
present Government, and for bringing in of <hi>Popery.</hi> That being at most of
their Meetings, he heard these very Expressions us'd; and was tempted with
Reward to be Instrumental in it, and to kill the King.<note place="margin">An <hi>Army</hi> to be set afoot upon the <hi>Killing</hi> of the <hi>King.</hi>
               </note> The men that put him

            </p>
            <p>That upon the Killing of the King, they were to be ready with an Army,
but not before: though at first it was resolved to raise an Army out of hand.</p>
            <p>They had some thoughts of beginning with a <hi>Massacre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Some thoughts of a <hi>Massacre.</hi>
               </note> and then to cut
off those that scap'd with an Army; but this Witness did not hear of any

my Lord <hi>Aston</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s; all in <hi>Staffordshire:</hi> And the

               <hi>Harcourt</hi> wrote a Letter to
<hi>Ewers,</hi> that began thus, <hi>This very Night Sir</hi> Edmundbury Godfry <hi>is dispatch'd;</hi>
and more to that purpose. The Witness saying thus to Mr. <hi>Ewers</hi> about it; <hi>I'll
be hang'd if this don't spoil the Design:</hi> whose answer was, that he was a great
Enemy of Loose people, and it would be judg'd some of them had done it in
Revenge. The Letter was received upon <hi>Monday</hi> night, and dated on <hi>Saturday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> declared,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> swears to the <hi>General Plot.</hi>

promised a considerable Reward, as my Lord's Butler told this Witness:
who afterwards meeting with <hi>Messenger,</hi> and asking him why he would do
it; his Answer was, <hi>that he was off on't now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being dispatch'd, 50000 men were forthwith to be raised,<note place="margin">An <hi>Army</hi> of 50000 to be set on foot upon the <hi>kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> of the <hi>King.</hi>

<hi>Fenwick, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> said in the Witnesse's hearing, being all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
That this Army was to set up the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> and all the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
to be destroyed: the Lords <hi>Arundell</hi> and <hi>Powis</hi> to command these
Forces. And he says, that one <hi>Harcourt</hi> (twice, at his Chamber in <hi>Dukes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street</hi>)
told him, that there were several to kill His Majesty. This was in the
hearing of one Mr. <hi>Thompson:</hi> and M. <hi>Fenwick</hi> told the Witness, that M. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi>
was deeply concerned in't; and that was all the Witness knew.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was then sworn,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> sworn.</note> and this is the summe of his Evidence. That

a day or two after his arrivall, to Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> at his Chamber in the
<hi>Middle Temple;</hi> who treated the Witness very respectfully: and upon tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him that the Witness thought his Sons would enter themselves into
the Society, Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> (standing that way affected himself) was very
glad of it; for <hi>matters would not hold long in</hi> England <hi>as they were,</hi> (he said)
and that if they kept themselves in the world, they might quickly come to
great preferment in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Witness was once more with Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi>
               <note place="margin">His second Meeting with Mr. <hi>Langhorn.</hi>
               </note> before his coming to
<hi>S. Omers,</hi> (which was in <hi>November old stile, December new,</hi>) when he gave
him a Pacquet of Letters to carry with him. In this Pacquet was a Letter
of Thanks to the Fathers at <hi>S. Omers,</hi> for their kindness to his Sons in their
journey for <hi>Spain;</hi> and promising the repayment of twenty pound which
they had furnished his Sons with upon their passage. This Letter was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<hi>Richard Langhorn,</hi> and it made mention of one written to Father
<hi>Le Chaise, in order to our Concerns.</hi> (These were the very words.) Now the
Letter to <hi>Le Chaise</hi> this Witness did not see, but onely the other that took
notice of it: and he said, that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> having written to him at large,
he should not trouble his Reverence with many words at that time.</p>
            <p>The Witness remembers also another Letter,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> charges Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Words.</note> either in <hi>March,</hi> or <hi>April,</hi>

expressed a wonderfull Zeal for the <hi>Catholick Design;</hi> and saying that
the <hi>Parliament</hi> began to cool in the business of the <hi>Protestant Religion;</hi>
and that now was the time to give the <hi>Blow:</hi> That was the word (<hi>the

            <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> minded the Court of the <hi>Consult</hi> here in <hi>April.</hi> The Witness
and divers others came from <hi>S. Omers,</hi> and other parts, to that <hi>Consult.</hi> Mr.
<hi>Langhorn</hi> himself was not at it; but the Witness was ordered by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall

            <p>The Witness swears that there were at that time divers Parchments lying

This Witness did not see the payment of the Money; but about <hi>Iuly,</hi> or

what he could towards the getting of it; and how troubled he was,
That Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> made such a difficulty of accepting of <hi>Ten

The Prisoner express'd the drift of his Questions to be only this; to see if
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> would now affirm what he swore in the Lords House: Dr.

which was sent to Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> some three weeks after to be Entred:

Money they had promised: The Sum was not named, but the VVitness
says that <hi>La Chaise</hi> told him, that the <hi>French King</hi> was sure enough, and
the Money not to be doubted. Nay, that <hi>part</hi> of it was already sent
over to <hi>Coleman,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the <hi>rest</hi> should follow so soon as they

And so he informed the Court, that in a Letter of 1676, an Account was
desired of the <hi>Religious</hi> at <hi>Doway</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> what progress they had
made with the rest of their Friends, towards the furnishing of <hi>Money;</hi>

another</hi> to the <hi>Popes Nuntio,</hi> and a <hi>third</hi> to the <hi>English Monks</hi> at
<hi>Paris.</hi> There were in these Letters expressions of <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi>
and in that to <hi>La Chaise,</hi> an Invitation of the Assistance of the
<hi>French.</hi> The Letter it self did not mention the destruction of the
<hi>King,</hi> and of the <hi>Protestant Religion;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Langhornes</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Colemans</hi> discourse expounded the meaning of it, and that it was to
overthrow the <hi>Government,</hi> and set up <hi>Popery;</hi> and they did also lay
their heads together after the Letters were transcribed. Here Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne</hi>
asked, if this were all that Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> had to charge upon him?
whose Answer was, that he thought of no more at present, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else might come into his mind hereafter.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> now minded the Court of one thing which he had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
There were 800000 Crowns (he said) as a Contribution from the

               </note> to be remitted into <hi>England:</hi> Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi>
was inquisitive after this Money, having advice that it was received in
<hi>France;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> himself told Father <hi>Harcourt, Keines</hi> and
<hi>Fenwick,</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> or <hi>August,</hi> that the Money was lodg'd in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> also recollected himself, that <hi>Keines</hi> told him one day,
<hi>I must go immediately to Mr.</hi> Langhorne; and when he returned after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
with a Letter in his hand, he told the VVitness that <hi>Cardinal

<hi>but they are four worthy</hi> Irish <hi>Gentlemen, that will do our business.</hi>
This VVitness neither asking any Question, nor heeding the matter till
<hi>Colemans</hi> Trial, that speaks of the <hi>Irish</hi> Men that were to attempt the

was declared that they were Witnesses, whether they had or not; or
otherwise, that they should not have been admitted. Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi>
however remitted himself to the <hi>Court,</hi> as to his Councel, <hi>Whether
having had their Pardons, they might not fall under the same prospect
in Law with an Approver; not as directly being Approvers, but under
some Equivalence of Reason with them.</hi> If the <hi>Approver</hi> be pardon'd, the
<hi>Appellee</hi> ought also to be discharged: it seems hard that those that were
<hi>Participes Criminis,</hi> and having now got their Pardons, should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
for allowable VVitnesses against the Prisoner.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> desired also to know,<note place="margin">To Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi>'s Objection, that the Witness had a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> prov'd the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and that he was 6 or 700 <hi>l.</hi> out of pocket.</note> if they had either received, or

Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> to acquit himself, declared that <hi>he had been Rewarded by
expending Six or seven hundred pounds out of his own Pocket, without
knowing whether ever he should see it again.</hi> Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> said, that
a Prisoner (Mr. <hi>Reading</hi>) told him Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> had received <hi>Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

Incompetent VVitness; and secondly, his 500 <hi>l.</hi> was for the discovery
of Sir <hi>Edmondb. Godfreys</hi> Murther; not for the <hi>Plot.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> to the same Question answers that he was 700 <hi>l.</hi> out of purse. The paint of the <hi>Approver</hi> over-rul'd.</note> Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi>

            <p>As to the <hi>Approver</hi> the Court told him, he was ever allowed main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and there must be a proof of corrupt Contract, or Subornation,
to invalidate a <hi>Witness.</hi> Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> gave the <hi>Court</hi> the Reason of
pressing this, for though it might be very prudential to invite any man
to come in by the promise of a Reward towards the discovery of a
<hi>Plot,</hi> where such a person absents himself; yet it seems very hard, that
when a man is once in Custody, VVitnesses should be call'd in against
him by such means: The Prisoner was here advised to speak first to the
<hi>Fact,</hi> and afterwards to the <hi>Witnesses.</hi> The Prisoner, upon this, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the Court, that he had no possibility of making any other
defence; setting forth, that from the 17 of <hi>October,</hi> to <hi>that day Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,</hi>
or <hi>Friday</hi> last, he had been kept so close that he knew nothing of
what was done abroad; no Friend or Relation admitted to him; he
could never hear what <hi>was</hi> charged upon him, and could not foresee
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93059:31"/>
what <hi>would</hi> be, and therefore the he had no other <hi>plea</hi> left him, but the
Incompetency of the <hi>Witnesses.</hi> It was objected to him as a Scandal to
the <hi>Kings Proclamation</hi> to suppose an Incouragement to the swearing
of a <hi>Plot,</hi> where there was none; and that <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
were touch'd in such a Reflection. Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> said no more,

            <p>Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> offered then, what appears both in his <hi>Narrative,</hi> and
upon his <hi>Oath</hi> in the <hi>Lords house;</hi> that he affirm'd Sir <hi>Robert Brett</hi>
came over with him. But Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> was to have spoken to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was Sworn <hi>There.</hi> Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> prest it, that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> had
own'd that what he Swore was truth; and so proceeded to his VVit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
concerning Sir <hi>Iohn Warner</hi> coming over with him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth Witness</hi> was Sir <hi>Iohn Warners</hi> Gardener; who affirmed,
that his Master was at <hi>Watton</hi> all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 1678; That the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
was only four days away at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and left his Master, and
found him at <hi>Watton:</hi> That for the last of <hi>April,</hi> the <hi>first, second</hi> and
<hi>third</hi> of <hi>May</hi> he saw Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> at St. <hi>Omers;</hi> and when he went away,
he did not know. He affirm'd, that St. <hi>Iohn Warner</hi> was at <hi>Watton</hi> all
<hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> but he would not speak to all <hi>Iune:</hi> Being asked, why
not to the one as well as to the other? His Answer was, that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
(Sir <hi>Francis Williams</hi>) came then for <hi>England,</hi> and in the Absence
of the <hi>Rector</hi> he took upon him the Charge of the House. This was
the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April;</hi> where Sir <hi>Iohn Warner</hi> was in <hi>Iune</hi> and <hi>Iuly</hi> he
could not tell, nor where in <hi>August</hi> and <hi>September;</hi> more than that he
went out of Town then, and the VVitness knew not whither. The
Court ask'd him, how he came to be more doubtful of these Months
than of the rest? And his Answer was, because that the question fell
upon the other Months. It was then reflected upon, that <hi>April</hi> 24 was
the very day that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> came over; and the <hi>Rector,</hi> one of those
that he said came over with him: but the VVitness reply'd, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93059:31"/>
the <hi>Rector</hi> came single, having onely one Officer of the <hi>College.</hi>
            </p>

and that he also saw Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Robert Brett,</hi> at the same time;
but where Sir <hi>Iohn Warner</hi> was then, he knew not; Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> affirmed

Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> affirmed, that he lay alone when he lay there; and that it
was the place where two men were seized, and carried away. The

Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ever lay in That place: Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> swears that he did lie there

that it was an Extract out of their <hi>Iournals;</hi> and the particular he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, was concerning the Company that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> says came over
with him from St. <hi>Omers:</hi> It is that which Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> remitted himself

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93059:32"/>
               <hi>Thomas Preston,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> came all along with him. The Prisoner
was told, that if he had a <hi>Record</hi> to overthrow his present Evidence, he
might produce it; Mr <hi>Laughorne</hi> then desired that those that took <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
Trial might be called, and that he might be permitted to make
proof by Witnesses of what was there Sworn, with regard to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
at the Barr; and being told that it was not to be done, the Prisoner
desired to know why not; for he had a Witness to prove that such
words were spoken; without which he had no means of Defence?
The Answer to him was, That as it would be no proof against him, so
it could be none for him.</p>
            <p>There was a <hi>Complaint</hi> here brought in by the <hi>Lord Castlemain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted by the <hi>Rabble,</hi> and the Court much offended at it.</note> of
Violence offered, by the Rabble, to the Prisoners Witnesses; and that
they were in danger of their lives, for their coming to give Evidence:
which was highly resented by the <hi>Court,</hi> as an affront to publick Justice,
and direction given to enquire out the Offenders, tht they might be
punished.</p>
            <p>A Witness was now called to speak to one point; about the meeting
at the <hi>Whitehorse Taverne:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Never a Room in the <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse Tavern</hi> that would hold the Consult.</note> who Informed, that she had kept the House
Seven years, and left it last <hi>Iuly.</hi> The Question was about the Number
that met at that <hi>Consult?</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> Answered, that there might be some
<hi>eighteen</hi> or <hi>twenty</hi> there at a time, and that they were divided into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Rooms. The Witness said, that she knew the greatest part of
those that used her House, and that she could say nothing to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of who was in her House <hi>April</hi> the 24<hi>th</hi> 1678; but that she did
not remember that ever she saw Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> there. It was plain however
that he might be there, and she not know on't. Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> gave
this Reason for asking how many, because Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> both in his <hi>Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi>
before the <hi>Lords,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Being said to be fifty Persons.</note> and in <hi>Colemans Trial,</hi> affirmed, There were
<hi>fifty</hi> Persons at that <hi>Meeting;</hi> and that then they adjourned into several
small <hi>Meetings.</hi> But it was returned, that so there might be, at several
times of the same day; and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> explained himself, That though
the Meeting was the 24<hi>th</hi> day, the <hi>Consult</hi> continued yet till the 26<hi>th</hi>
at Night. The Witness urged, that she never knew so many in the
House together, but once, in all her time, and that was upon a <hi>Iury;</hi>
and they were forc'd to put them into <hi>three</hi> Rooms, for there was not a
Chamber to receive above a dozen: Upon this <hi>three Witnesses</hi> made
Oath;<note place="margin">Prov'd, that <hi>two</hi> of the Rooms would hold 25 or 30 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece.</note> the <hi>first,</hi> that he had seen a <hi>dozen</hi> or <hi>sixteen</hi> at dinner there in a
Room together; and that it would hold <hi>twenty:</hi> the <hi>second,</hi> that there
were two Rooms in the House, where <hi>twenty five</hi> or <hi>thirty</hi> might Dine
together in either of them: and a <hi>third,</hi> that he himself was at a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-dinner
there, towards the Street, where there were above <hi>twenty</hi>
Persons. The Prisoner thought it material however, if the Room
would not hold <hi>fifty;</hi> and he spake only upon Information, for he had
never been <hi>There.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> being ask'd,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr. Langh.</hi> offer'd some Questions to the <hi>Court,</hi> which were not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> if he had any more Witnesses, mov'd
that he might reserve them till the <hi>Kings Council</hi> had spoken; but that
was not found allowable: so he pray'd an Answer to a Question or two,
if the Court pleas'd. The <hi>one; Was Mr.</hi> Ireland <hi>here in</hi> London <hi>in</hi>
August, <hi>or not?</hi> To which it was reply'd, that it was a point forreign
to the matter in question. The <hi>other</hi> was, <hi>Since Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>affirm'd
himself six or seven hundred pound out of purse since his Discovery, if
the Prisoner might examine two Witnesses upon the probability of that
assertion; for if he were extreamly Necessitous before, how should he
get Credit for it since, but by his Evidence?</hi> But it was found to be a
matter clear from the Point to demand of him, how he came by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>

               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:93059:33"/>
Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> then offer'd a Copy of a <hi>Record</hi> of the House of <hi>Lords,</hi>

               </note>
to prove that Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> had there declared, that <hi>he had no Person
more to charge, either in the House, or out of the House, than what he
there charged;</hi> and that he the Prisoner was none of the Persons there
Charged. It was Objected, that he might forget things at that time,
and call them to mind afterwards; and besides, that some body
should have been produced to prove, that Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> took That
<hi>Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> offered a Question now concerning the <hi>Commissions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Langh.</hi> asks how the <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> were disposed of.</note>
asking whether or no (and to <hi>whom</hi>) the Prisoner distributed those <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions,</hi>
as the VVitness says he did?</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> Replyed, That he only said the Commissions were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
but not to <hi>whom;</hi> but that he affirms they were for those <hi>five</hi>
Persons, and that the Prisoner himself told him in <hi>Iuly,</hi> or <hi>August,</hi> that
he had dispos'd of them, without naming to whom; only speaking of
<hi>one,</hi> which he sent his Son with to my Lord <hi>Arundell</hi>'s eldest Son: He
told this VVitness, it was delivered, not calling to mind that he knew
of any other. This Question is put (says Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi>) because Dr.
<hi>Oates</hi> Charged the Prisoner before the <hi>Lords,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> with a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.</note> with sending the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the <hi>Lord Arundel</hi> himself. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> affirming also, that he
saw a <hi>Letter</hi> in the Prisoners Chamber, acknowledging the Receipt
of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> desired,<note place="margin">The <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at <hi>Colemans</hi> Trial.</note> that Mr. <hi>Lidcott</hi> might be examined to a point
of Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence at <hi>Colemans Trial;</hi> where he says, that he
came, and communicated to the Prisoner the Matter of the <hi>Consult</hi> the
very next day after it, and never saw the Prisoner any more; but Mr.
<hi>Lidcott</hi> (though <hi>present</hi> there) was not able to speak to the particulars
of the <hi>Trial;</hi> so Mr. <hi>Blany</hi> was ask'd what he could Testifie upon
that point; who acknowledged, that he took the Notes, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
something about Mr. <hi>Langhorne;</hi> but could not charge his Memory
upon it without Book: So Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> presented the <hi>Narrative;</hi>
which Mr. <hi>Blany</hi> said was not printed from his <hi>Copy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">No Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </note> But an <hi>Historical
Narrative</hi> was agreed to be no Evidence in Law. Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi>
offer'd, that without some light to his Charge he could not prepare
himself for his defence: and that in other Cases people are confronted
before a Magistrate, and so come to understand the Matter of their
Charge.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Sillyard</hi> was called; but affirming that she durst not give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
without being secur'd from the Rabble: and the Court being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to promise Justice upon any Offender in <hi>that</hi> kind that should be
brought before them, she was discharged, by Mr. <hi>Langhornes</hi> consent,
without Examination.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> said,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne</hi> insists upon the Incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the Witnesses.</note> that he intended to make use of her Evidence
to a Deposition of Mr. <hi>Bedloes</hi> at <hi>Readings Trial;</hi> which was, that he
could have said more against <hi>Whitebread,</hi> and <hi>Fenwick,</hi> then he did at
their First Trials; which Concealment he took to be Perjury, for not
having told all the Truth; and that however Impertinent it might
seem, it was yet of great effect to the Prisoner, to shew that the VVit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against him was not to be believed. But Mr. <hi>Whitebread,</hi> having
before receiv'd an Answer to that Objection, the <hi>Kings Council</hi> summ'd
up the whole Matter in brief to the Jury; and then more of the Kings
VVitnesses were Sworn.</p>

eight years. That towards the end of <hi>March</hi> 1678, or the middle of
<hi>April</hi> following, he had seen him in <hi>England</hi> in a Disguise, and could
not call him to mind that Night; but early in the Morning it came into
his head that it was <hi>Titus Oates:</hi> and so he rose early to enquire of a
Gentlewoman concerning him, that knew him; and asking her how
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> did, she struck her hand upon the Counter, and cried, <hi>He is
an undone man, for he was turn'd Papist.</hi> The VVitness asking her
then, if she knew were he was? <hi>No,</hi> said she, <hi>he is skulking some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
up and down here, and dares not shew his head in the day.</hi>
Whereupon this VVitness told her, that he had seen him the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
about <hi>ten</hi> in the Morning, betwixt St. <hi>Martins Lane</hi> and <hi>Leicester
House;</hi> but that he was disguised: and the VVitness described his Habit
to her. Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> prayed he might speak to the <hi>Time</hi> as near as
he could; and the VVitness said, that he did rather think (but could
not be positive) that it was about the <hi>Middle of April,</hi> and that it was
1678, not 1677; about the time of the year, when he usually came to
Town to receive Money. And the VVitness affirms, That it was Dr.
<hi>Oates</hi> whom he saw, and that he was brought up for a VVitness, having
spoken of this passage to several Persons after the Report of the <hi>Plot;</hi>
which he supposes might come to Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s ear by Chance.</p>

her; adding, that it was about the <hi>middle of April</hi> was Twelve-month,

heardly knew him. That the witness in Court was the Man, and <hi>Titus
Oates</hi> his Name. This VVitness bad him <hi>Welcome</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> but he
went in, and came forth again, without taking any notice of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
He was in a Grey-coat, a Flopping-hat, Plain-shoes, his Hair
cropt to his Ears; and one would rather have taken him for a <hi>Shepheard</hi>
than a <hi>Minister.</hi> Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> ask'd, if it were in 1678, or in 1677?
The VVitness affirmed it to be in <hi>May</hi> was Twelve-month, and that
he told his Master about a week after, at his coming out of the Country,
That Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> had been there, in a strange Dress, to ask for Doctor

Child, and that his Servants told him, that they had seen him about a
year ago; and that he himself had not seen him, which he wondred at,
having lately seen his Father, who said nothing of it: and that he the

               <hi>Whitson-week,</hi> at the VVitnesses coming home, that he was told by his

what Message he had left, it was answered, that he only asked for the
VVitness, and for Dr. <hi>Tongue;</hi> and this was in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> was
Twelvemonth. Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> seemed to admire that the VVitness
should intend him a <hi>Benefice</hi> under these Circumstances. Sir <hi>Richard
Barker</hi> was certain that this was in 1678: and informed the <hi>Court</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that a Grandson of Sir <hi>William Thorold</hi> (now Sr. <hi>William Thorold</hi>)
and two or three of the <hi>Vniversity</hi> had a Conversation with Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>

into the Society; but that he thought he should put him off: the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
declaring himself to be of the <hi>Church,</hi> but not of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
And that he was certain that this was in 1678. Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> desired
to know, whether Mr. <hi>Clay</hi> rememberd any thing of Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s playing
at that time with Mr. <hi>Howards</hi> Son, or talking to him about his Book, or
asking him Questions? But Mr. <hi>Clay</hi> remembred nothing of it, nor that

Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> met there. Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> explaining himself, that he spake of
his eldest Son, who deceased two years since.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> being called upon to speak what he had to say,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hornes</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and Exception to Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> his Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
his Case; That he was accused by two VVitnesses: the first, Mr.
<hi>Oates,</hi> against whom, if he could prove any thing false given in Evidence,
he conceived that he ought not to be regarded. As for Sir <hi>Tho. Prestons</hi>
coming over with him in <hi>April,</hi> it hath been clearly made out that he
was then at <hi>Liege:</hi> and for Sr. <hi>Iohn Warner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> and others, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the same passage, he said, that the falsity was proved against him
beyond dispute. Then as to himself, it was proved likewise that he was
sick in the <hi>Infirmary</hi> after Mr. <hi>Hilsley</hi> was come away; he deposing that
they came together. These Particulars being clearly proved, he thought
sufficient to take off Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> Credit; averring also, that from <hi>November</hi>
1677 to that minute, he never set eye on him. The Prisoner set forth,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93059:34"/>
that he had been a great while kept close, and but one Week allowed him
to prepare his defence; and therefore depending that he would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
the same things here which he has publish'd in his <hi>Narratives,</hi>
all that the Prisoner could do was to arm himself as well as he could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
these Points. Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> did likewise tell the <hi>Court,</hi> that he had
seen Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term 1677 once or twice, and that he
brought him a Letter from his yonger Son in <hi>Spain.</hi> He told the Prisoner,
that he would go over to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> for he could not get himself admitted
into any of the Colleges in <hi>Spain.</hi> He affirmed, that since that day, till
now in the <hi>Court,</hi> he never saw him; nor knew a face of any of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
from St. <hi>Omers:</hi> And that he hoped the <hi>Iury</hi> could not look
upon those Youths as Capable of driving on a <hi>Design,</hi> or aiming at a
<hi>Reward.</hi> It was reflected, They were all <hi>Papists,</hi> and in a <hi>Common
Causes.</hi> Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> offer'd to that Objection, That if the One side
ought not to be Credited, as being <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Friends:</hi> so neither
was the Other, as being <hi>Enemies.</hi> If it were clear, that he neither
Lodg'd at <hi>Groves,</hi> nor came over with <hi>Hilsley;</hi> or that neither Sir
<hi>Thomas Preston, Warner,</hi> or <hi>Poole</hi> came with him, that then his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ought not to be look'd upon as valuable.</p>
            <p>And then as to Mr. <hi>Bedloes</hi> Evidence,<note place="margin">And to <hi>Mr. Bedloes.</hi>
               </note> it may be considered; <hi>First,</hi>
there is no proving of a <hi>Negative: Secondly,</hi> that the Prisoner had
no acquaintance with him, nor can say, that in his whole life, he ever
saw him before This Occasion: (But yet 'tis possible that he might
see him, and not know it.) Is it probable now (says Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne</hi>)
that the Prisoner, if he were guilty, would ever have taken
Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> into a Confidence, in a Privacy of this Nature; or that
a Person of the Prisoners Practice should spend his time in Registring
Letters, and keeping Accounts for any particular <hi>Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</hi>
If the Prisoner could have known his <hi>Charge,</hi> he might
have accommodated his <hi>Defence</hi> to it: and the VVitnesses that he had
were only such as his Friends thought might be beneficial to him. The
Other side having had all Advantages of bringing their VVitnesses
together. The Prisoner suggested further, That if he fell under any
prejudice for his <hi>Religion,</hi> it would look as if he suffer'd for <hi>That.</hi>
Concluding with this Declaration, That <hi>he did believe it Damnation
to any one that should go about to kill the King, or deprive him
of his Government:</hi> and he recommended the rest to the <hi>Court,</hi> and
to the <hi>Iury.</hi> And the <hi>Lord Chief Iustice</hi> hereupon gave directions to
the <hi>Iury,</hi> with his usual Candor and Gravity.</p>
            <p>After Directions given, the Court reflected upon a Letter found
amongst <hi>Harcourts</hi> Papers, which had been made use of in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
of the Day before; and was found <hi>six</hi> or <hi>seven</hi> days after Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s
Information of a PLOT to the <hi>Council.</hi> This Letter the <hi>Court</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to be read, as a Paper that might give some light to the <hi>General
Designe,</hi> and it was read accordingly.</p>

County of <hi>Middlesex</hi> having found the Indictment two days before)
they were upon the <hi>tenth</hi> of the same Month brought again to the Barr,
to receive their Trials: when his <hi>Majesties Council</hi> having open'd the
Indictment, the Kings VVitnesses were called; and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> first Sworn,
who gave Evidence.</p>
            <p>That he applied himself to Sir <hi>Edmondh. Godfrey, September</hi> the

Truth thereof, he carried the Record back again; and, <hi>September</hi> the
28<hi>th</hi> repaired to Sir <hi>Edmond Godfrey</hi> with two or three perfect Copies,
and Swore them also. This being done, the VVitness gave Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof to the Council: After which Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> came unto the
VVitness (<hi>September</hi> the 30<hi>th,</hi> as he remembers) and told him what
<hi>Ill-will</hi> he had got; some reproaching, and threatning him for doing
so <hi>much;</hi> and others, for doing so <hi>little;</hi> and that the <hi>Parliament</hi> should
be acquainted with it, being to meet on the <hi>One and twentieth</hi> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>

was wanting, he told the VVitness that some <hi>Popish Lords</hi> menac'd
him for medling in the Business. That he had great apprehensions of
mischief from the <hi>Papist</hi>'s Party; and he told the VVitness how he
had been watched for several days. The VVitness asked him, why he
went without a Servant? He had One, he said, but he was a pitiful
weak Creature: the VVitness then advising him to get him some smart
Lad to wait upon him; but he gave little heed to it: telling him, that
he did not fear any Man upon the <hi>square;</hi> but still he would be talking to
the VVitness of the danger that he was in; who gave him this Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
That if it should be his Lot to suffer, it would be in a Righteous
Cause.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Robinson</hi> Esquire was Sworn;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and deposed, that Sir <hi>Edmond</hi>

            </p>
            <p>They had a great deal of talk there concerning the <hi>Plot;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with Sr. <hi>Edmond-Bury Godfrey</hi> about the <hi>Plot.</hi>
               </note> That this
VVitness told Sir <hi>Edmondb.</hi> that it was said he had taken several Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
about it. To which he made Answer, that <hi>he had done more in
it, than he thought he should have Thanks for;</hi> and that <hi>he could have
been well content if it had fallen into some other hand.</hi> This VVitness
telling him, That he had but done his duty; and desiring a sight of the
<hi>Examinations,</hi> if he had them about him. But his Answer was, that
<hi>a Great Person had them, and that when he got them again, the VVitness
should see them.</hi> They both agreed that they were not yet at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of it; <hi>But upon my Conscience,</hi> (said Sir <hi>Edmondb.) I believe that
I shall be the first Mariyr:</hi> adding, that <hi>no man should have his Life
neither upon easie Terms.</hi> The VVitness advising him to go with a Man,
and he not liking it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> was then Sworn:</p>
            <p>Who declared,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Prance</hi>'s Evidence.</note> that before Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> was murther'd, for a fortnight
or three Weeks, there were several <hi>Meetings</hi> at the <hi>Plow-Alehouse,</hi>
where was <hi>Green, Girald</hi> and <hi>Kelly;</hi> and that the two latter (who
were <hi>Priests</hi>) drew the VVitness in,<note place="margin">Drawn in by <hi>Green, Girald,</hi> and <hi>Kelly.</hi>
               </note> perswading him that it was no Sin,
but rather a piece of Charity; for he was a busie Man and would be
very troublesome. These words passed at the <hi>Plow,</hi> and at the <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi>
some week or fortnight befor the Murther. Upon the meeting of
<hi>Green, Hill</hi> and <hi>Girald,</hi> they came to a Resolution, that who ever saw
him first should immediately give notice to the rest, that they might be
ready for him. <hi>Girlad, Kelly</hi> and <hi>Green</hi> said in the VVitnesses hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they had dogg'd him into the <hi>Red-Lion Fields,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Edmond.</hi> dogg'd into <hi>Red-Lion-fields.</hi>
               </note> but had no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to kill him There. On a Sunday-morning Mr. <hi>Kelly</hi> came to
the VVitness, and told him, that they were then Watching of him; and
told the VVitness afterwards, that either <hi>Hill</hi> or <hi>Green</hi> had been at his
House to enquire for him; but the Servant telling him, Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> was
not up, he left word that he would come again by and by: after this
they waited their time, and then dogg'd him, as <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Green</hi> told
this VVitness; but whether it was <hi>Green</hi> or <hi>Hill</hi> that went, he could not
say. And that Day <hi>Girald, Green</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> dogg'd him from one place
to another, and so into St. <hi>Clements.</hi>
               <note place="margin">They had sett him in St. <hi>Clements.</hi>
               </note> About Seven of the Clock <hi>Green</hi>
told the VVitness where Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> was; and he hasten'd away from
his own House to <hi>Somerset-house</hi> immediately, the VVitness living in
<hi>Princess-street,</hi> not far off. Where he was at St. <hi>Clements</hi> this VVitness
cannot tell.</p>
            <p>Towards Nine a Clock notice was given to <hi>Hill</hi> (who came before)
that the VVitness was to be in readiness.<note place="margin">And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the Murther.</note> Presently upon This <hi>Hill</hi>
went away to the Gate, and as Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> was passing by, he desired
him to try, if he could quiet two Fellows yonder that were quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling;<note place="margin">A Quarrel pretended.</note>
which he was loath to do: but <hi>Hill</hi> pressing it, that the
Authority of a <hi>Iustice</hi> might make them Friends, Sir <hi>Edmond</hi>
went along with him; and as he was at the bottom of the Railes
<hi>Green</hi> got a Handkercher about his Neck,<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Murther.</note> which he had twisted, and
there pulled him over, and punched him, and choak'd him. <hi>Girald</hi>
would have run him through with his Sword; but the rest were against
it, for fear that it should be found out by the blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:93059:36"/>
The VVitness went to the Body a matter of a quarter of an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and handling it perceived that he had life in him yet; for his Legs
quivered;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Green</hi> twist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Neck and bragged of it.</note> but then <hi>Green</hi> took him by the Neck and turned it quite
round. The VVitness does not say that he saw him do this, but <hi>Green</hi>
made his brags of it, and the rest told the VVitness of it too. The Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was ordered by <hi>Hill</hi> to stand at the Water-gate, and <hi>Berry</hi> looked
to the Stairs; they did all four tell the VVitness of the twisting of his
Neck, and they were about the body when the VVitness went down.
<hi>Berry</hi> was not there at first, but he came before they had him into the
house, and helped to carry him up; and so did this VVitness, with the
rest. That is to say <hi>Girald, Green, Hill, Kelly, Berry</hi> and the <hi>VVitness</hi>
did all put their helping hands. He was carried into Dr. <hi>Godwins</hi> house,
where <hi>Hill</hi> (that had been the Doctors man) had a Chamber, and he went
before to get the door open, while the rest brought the body, the body
was kept there till <hi>Munday Night;</hi> and then it was laid in <hi>Somerset-House</hi>
where this VVitness saw it by <hi>Hills</hi> Dark-Lanthorn, they were all
there, and upon <hi>Tuesday Night</hi> the body was removed again into <hi>Hills</hi>
Lodgings, in a Court below there. What was thrown over him, this
VVitness does not know, <hi>Hill</hi> had a Dark-Lanthorn which was all the
light there was; but the VVitness was certain that it was Sir <hi>Edmund God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys</hi>
body. It should have been laid in <hi>Hills</hi> Lodgings, but some bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
being there they conveyed it into a Room that was overagainst it
(Sir <hi>Iohn Arundels</hi> Lodgings as he thought.) About Nine, on <hi>Wednesday
Night</hi> as they were carrying it into the Chamber where it was first, this
VVitness had the hap to come just at that time, which started them so,
that they ran away; but upon the VVitnesses speaking <hi>Berry</hi> returned,
and the body was got up and so carried off about Midnight in a <hi>Sedan.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The body carried off in a <hi>Sedan.</hi>
               </note>
It was <hi>Hill</hi> that brought the <hi>Sedan,</hi> and all the Company helped to get
him into it. <hi>Girald</hi> and the VVitness took him up first; <hi>Berry</hi> stood
ready upon a <hi>Hemm</hi> to open the Gate, and so he was carried out at the
<hi>Vpper Court Gate, Green</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> went before, and they took him up
in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> to ease the other, In <hi>Longacre</hi> the VVitness and his
Companion took him up again, and carried him on as far as <hi>Soho</hi>
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hill</hi> was ready there with a Horse,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hill</hi> meets them with a Horse and takes up the body.</note> and there the body was set up
astride and <hi>Hill</hi> rode behind it holding it up; <hi>Green, Hill, Girald</hi> and
<hi>Kelly,</hi> went along with him, the <hi>Sedan</hi> being put into a new-built
house till they returned.</p>
            <p>The next morning <hi>Hill,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hill, Kelly,</hi> and <hi>Girald,</hi> run his Sword through him.</note> 
               <hi>Kelly,</hi> and <hi>Girald</hi> told the VVitness that they
had thrust his Sword through his body, cast him into a Ditch, and his
Gloves and things were laid upon the Bank.</p>
            <p>As to their meeting at <hi>Bow,</hi> it was at one <hi>Cashes</hi> the <hi>Queens-Head,</hi> there
was one <hi>Leueson, Vernat,</hi> the <hi>VVitness,</hi> Mr. <hi>Girald</hi> and one <hi>Dethick,</hi>
that Mr. <hi>Vernat</hi> sent for by a Cobler; and he came immediately. There
was a Barrel of Oysters for Dinner,<note place="margin">Their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation at <hi>Bow.</hi>
               </note> and a Dish of Fish, that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
bought himself: and it was the <hi>Friday</hi> after the <hi>Proclamation</hi> for
sending all <hi>Papists</hi> out of Town.</p>
            <p>The pretence of this meeting (as Mr. <hi>Vernat</hi> told the VVitness) was
only to be merry.</p>
            <p>While the Company was making merry, the VVitnesshearing somthing
rustle at the door,<note place="margin">A Drawer overheard the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators at the Tavern.</note> he went and found a Drawer hearkning there; and
told him he had a good mind to kick him down stairs, and so went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
The VVitness says that <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Berry</hi> were in the business before
him, as <hi>Girald</hi> said, with whom the VVitness had been several times at
<hi>Berries</hi> House; they met twice at the <hi>Plow,</hi> and the second time <hi>Hill</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:93059:37"/>
was there. They said there was a great reward promised, but this Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
cannot tell what.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Girald</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Giralds</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to murther Sir <hi>Edmund.</hi>
               </note> had taken up a full resolution to destroy him that Night: and,
rather than fail, he would have killed him in the Street; in the Lane
that goes down to his House. Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> being questioned about
Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> declared that before the VVitness was in Prison, he cannot
remember that ever he was in Mr. <hi>Bedlows</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hill</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hill</hi> obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted against <hi>Prances</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony.</note> desired the Court that <hi>Prances</hi> Evidence might not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against him, because he had denyed all to the King, that he had
before Confessed; and so was perjured; but he was answered, that his
Confession was not upon Oath. <hi>Hill</hi> asked <hi>Prance</hi> what time it was he went to Sir <hi>Edmond Godfreys,</hi> who answered that it was <hi>Nine or Ten a
Clock. Hill</hi> affirmed that he had not been abroad that day; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
every syllable.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Berry</hi> askt <hi>Prance</hi> what people were in the house, when he said he
was there, and bad him name any; and <hi>Prance</hi> told him that his <hi>Wife</hi> was
there, and <hi>Girald, Kelly</hi> and the <hi>VVitness.</hi> But <hi>Berry</hi> could not deny
the knowing of <hi>Prance,</hi> no more could <hi>Hill</hi> nor <hi>Green. Prance</hi> could
give no account from whence they <hi>Hounded</hi> him, when they murthered
him; he was carried into the House some quarter of an hour after he
was killed, being taken and by surprise strangled.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Richardson</hi> was asked what he knew of <hi>Prances</hi>
               <note place="margin">The reason of <hi>Prances</hi> flying off.</note> denying
what he had consested: who declared, that he was ordered, the night
before the last Parliament was Prorogued, to carry <hi>Prance</hi> before the
Committee of Lords, to be examined: How that he was in great disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and earnest to speak with His Majesty; and that being brought into
Kings Closset, he threw himself upon his knees and cryed, <hi>He was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,</hi>
and <hi>they were all Innocent,</hi> and he said as much to the Council,
denying upon the question that any body had tampered with him.
That so soon as ever he was in the Prison again he begged of Captain
<hi>Richardson</hi> that for Gods sake he would go tell the King that all he had
now said was false, and that true which he before made Oath of; and
if he might have his Pardon, he would make a considerable Discovery.
That he recanted purely out of fear, that he had lost all his Custom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Catholicks, and though the King should Pardon him, they
would go near to murther him. And Captain <hi>Richardson</hi> declared that
after his Pardon he demeaned himself very quietly; and expressing a
great detestation of the practices in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> Sworn,</p>
            <p>Who declared that <hi>Le Faire, Pritchard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bedlows</hi> Evidence.</note> and divers Priests besides
had dealt with him for the killing of a person, without naming the man,
and that he should have help and a good reward: and that this was in
<hi>October</hi> or <hi>September</hi> last. After which <hi>Le Faire, Pritchard,</hi> and <hi>Welch,</hi>
put him upon working himself into an Acquaintance with Sir <hi>Edmond
Godfrey.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He made an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Sir <hi>Edmund Godfrey.</hi>
               </note>
That this VVitness having introduced himself into a familiarity
with Sir <hi>Edmund;</hi> insomuch that he had been at his house for about
a week together day after day; they would have had the VVitness have
brought them into his Company too. That he made his Acquaintance
by going to him for <hi>Warrants</hi> against people, and this VVitness had been
with him every day but <hi>Saturday</hi> the week before he was murthered.
That upon <hi>Friday,</hi> the day before, the VVitness sent his Boy to know
if he were at home, with an intent to have gotten him over to the <hi>Grey
Hound Tavern,</hi> where the Confederates then were, five <hi>Iesuits;</hi> but he
was not at home, and so <hi>Le Faire, Welch</hi> and the <hi>VVitness,</hi> went into
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93059:37"/>
the City. That <hi>Le Faire</hi> having been next morning at the VVitnesses
Chamber, and missing him, they met by chance in the Afternoon in
<hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields;</hi> and so they went to the <hi>Palsgraves Head Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns</hi>
together; where, upon discourse, he told the VVitness, there
was a very considerable man, who was that night to be <hi>put out of the
way</hi> (that was the expression) for he had gotten all the Informations of
Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tonge;</hi> and if these Papers were not taken from
him, there would be such Discoveries made as would endanger the
whole <hi>design.</hi> The VVitness could not get it from him, who he was;
but there had been several Plots upon him, and none of them had
hit: and that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> had orders to pay 4000l. for the service.
The VVitness parted with him then, upon his promise to come to him
at <hi>Somerset-House</hi> Cloyster that night: but the VVitness knowing the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
failed him; and saw him not again till <hi>Munday Night</hi> in <hi>Red
Lion</hi> Court, where he met him. He charged the VVitness with not
keeping his word, who told him that he fell into other Company;
and besides that he could not ingage to kill any man without knowing,
first,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Le Faire</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> to meet him.</note> who it was. Well! (says he to the VVitness) be you at Nine a
Clock to Night at <hi>Somerset-House,</hi> and you shall hear more. The
VVitness went punctually at his time, and they had a great deal of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
together in the Cloyster: from thence he walked the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
into the Court, and chid him for not assisting in that affair;<note place="margin">Their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note> but
however, if <hi>you will lend us your hand now</hi> (said he) <hi>to get him off,
you shall have two thousand pounds of the four.</hi> The VVitness then
asking if he were murthered; he answered <hi>Yes.</hi> The VVitness then
demanded if he might not see him; he told him that he might; and
so he led him by the hand through a dark passage into the place
where the body lay.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> brought to the body.</note> There were several people in the Room; but
how many, and who they were, he could not say. There was no
light in it but a Lanthorn; and by that the VVitness could discern the
body. There was a <hi>Cravat</hi> about his Neck, drawn so streight, that
the VVitness could not get his Finger betwixt. They had some discourse
then of getting him away; pretending him to be one that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to a Person of Quallity. The VVitness was very much surprised
when he found who it was; and urged the dropping of him into the
<hi>Thames</hi> with weights to sink him:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> advised the sinking of the body in the <hi>Thames. Le Faire</hi> charges him to help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the body by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he took on <hi>Thursday.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> troubled in Conscience.</note> but they rather chose to have it put
upon himself, and to carry him out in a <hi>Chair</hi> and the Porter <hi>Berry</hi> should
be ready at the Gate to let them out. They owned that they had
strangled him and would have had the VVitness to help them out with
him. But he excused himself as being yet too early, and that it were
better to stay till about Eleven or Twelve a Clock, promising to be
with them again: But (says <hi>Le Faire) upon the Sacrament you took on
Thursday you will be at the carrying him off to Night,</hi> which the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
promised; and so they parted.</p>
            <p>This lay heavy upon the VVitnesses Conscience, who could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to discover that which he had taken two Sacraments in a week to
conceal. In this trouble of Thought, the VVitness went to <hi>Bristol,</hi>
where God put it into his heart that some murthers were past, and
greater to come; For the prevention whereof he was at last convinced
of the duty of revealing this wickedness; and so made his application
to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> thereupon. Meeting <hi>Prance</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the <hi>Lobby;</hi> and there apprehending him. Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
also that he saw <hi>Green</hi> was about the Court, the night
when the body was to be carryed away; and that he heard <hi>Berry</hi>
was to open the Gate: but they finding that the VVitness had again
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93059:38"/>
disappointed them, put it off that night for fear of further obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> being called upon to say somthing to the business of
<hi>Prance,</hi>

               </note> reported the matter, how that finding the croud to be great
in the Lords <hi>Lobby,</hi> and being desirous himself to be private, he
bad the Guard clear the Room of all that had no business there;
an order was given for all to quit but Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> and his <hi>Friends:</hi>
when seeing a man lift up his Hat; to find out his way, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be <hi>Prance,</hi> the VVitness charged his Guards with him; but
he being then in custody, and the Constable telling him that he was
his Prisoner, the VVitness bad him have a care of him, and afterwards
charged him before the House of Lords.</p>
            <p>As to the Prisoners: <hi>Hill</hi> said that he never saw Mr. <hi>Bedlow;</hi> and
<hi>Berry,</hi> that he never saw Mr. <hi>Girald.</hi>

               </note> about the finding Sir <hi>Edmund God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys</hi>
body; whose Evidence was, that the body was found in a Ditch,
his Sword sticking in it, and two handfuls through his Back: neither
the Sword, nor the place where it lay, was bloody. He had a thrust
in another place, but striking upon a Rib, it passed no further: and
there was no blood there neither. His breast was bruised, his Neck
broken (as the VVitness believed) his Gloves and Stick by him, upon
the Bank; his servant said that it was his Masters Sword, and he had
both Gold and Silver in his Pocket.</p>
            <p>The Prisoners offered this VVitness no questions.<note place="margin">Evidence upon the view of his body.</note> The <hi>Surgeons</hi> were
then Sworn, that viewed the body and opened it. Mr. <hi>Skillard</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that he viewed the body at Twelve a Clock the next day after
it was found. That the Breast was bruised as with blows or stamping
on it, his Neck distorted: two wounds, one fell on a Rib and the other
past through his body: but he never dyed of those wounds, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Cloths nor his Wastcoat were pierced; his Neck was certainly
broken; and probably he might be dead four or five days before these
wounds were given: upon the opening of him it appeared that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to putrifie.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cambridge,</hi> another <hi>Chirurgeon,</hi> was Sworn, who deposed that
he saw the body on the same day with Mr. <hi>Skillard;</hi> the Neck dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed,
bruised upon the Breast, one wound on a Rib, and another
that past through him under the left Pap, which wounds were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
given him after he was dead.</p>

Deposing that a matter of a Fortnight before her Masters death, the
Prisoner there, that they called <hi>Green</hi>) was at Sir <hi>Edmund Godfreys</hi>
House in the Morning, to inquire for him, and first gave him the time
of the day in <hi>English,</hi> and afterwards said somthing to him in <hi>French</hi>

particularly remembring that she was then doing somthing about the

with him, and then went up stairs, and missing her Keys, came down
again, and found them upon the Parlour Table; and <hi>Hill</hi> was yet there,
in the very Cloths he had on in the court, about Nine or Ten a Clock:
which agreed with <hi>Prances</hi> Evidence; <hi>Hill</hi> acknowledging, that he

<hi>December</hi> the 24. Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> was examined about Sir <hi>Edmond Godfreys</hi>
murther: and that his information having so many particulars in it, of
such a <hi>Bench,</hi> such a <hi>Corner, Room, Passage</hi> and <hi>Gallery;</hi> The Board not
understanding it, the King directed the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Lord of
<hi>Ossory,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vicechamberlain</hi> to the Queen, to repair to the place and
there take Mr. <hi>Prances</hi> examination, and report it to the Board; and
this VVitness waiting upon the Lords, took the Examination, and drew
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93059:39"/>
it up into a <hi>Report;</hi> which was signed by the two Honourable Lords,
and read that Afternoon at the Board. Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> shewed the
Lords the Bench they sat upon to wait Sir <hi>Edmond Godfreys</hi> coming;
the Corner they lugged him unto, when they had killed him, the <hi>Stairs</hi>
where <hi>Berry</hi> was to stay, a Little Door with a Stair Case at the Stables
end; a long dark Entry with a door, and eight steps, that led to Dr. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi>
Lodgings; up two steps on the right hand, there was a kind of a
Closet with a Bed in it, and Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> told the Lords, that, first, they
got him thither, and left him in <hi>Hills</hi> charge for two nights; the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
there present, and every thing agreeing with Mr. <hi>Prances</hi> relation
to the Council; and to what he now delivered in Court; only that his
Relation was now inlarged, and that the Lodgings which he took to be
Sir <hi>Iohn Arundels,</hi> were not capable of any person of Quality. Mr. <hi>Prance</hi>
went thus far ready and directly; but coming to examine the place
whither they had carried the body, he said it was somwhere by the
Garden. There is a long dark Entry that opens into the Outer Court;
he past through that, and then over the Quadrangle to the Piazza; and
then went down a pair of Stairs, saying <hi>Thus far we are right I am sure,</hi>
There is a large square Court below; and there he began to doubt;
but yet went on, and so past into divers Rooms on the other side of the
Court; and then up Stairs again, and into other Rooms; but still at a
loss in what Room it was that he saw the body: only certain that he
had been in that place; the VVitness still referring himself to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
Sir <hi>Robert Southwel</hi> now produced the Minutes he had taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these mens Examinations wherein it appeared, that <hi>Hill</hi> was Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
that he confest he knew <hi>Girald,</hi> but not <hi>Kelly; Hill</hi> then inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing,
that he knew one <hi>Girald</hi> who was not a Priest, and that he
did not know <hi>Girald</hi> the Priest.</p>
            <p>It was charged upon <hi>Berry,</hi>

                  <hi>Berries</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not to admit any body.</note> the saying that he had Orders not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any Strangers or persons of Condition into <hi>Somerset-House</hi> for two

and that he never had any such Orders before. To which <hi>Berry</hi>
replyed that the P. might have entred if he had pleased; that it had
been proved (as was acknowledged by the Court) that five or six had
gone in before. That he had an order only for two days, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
and that he had had such Orders formerly. But there being
no such Orders produced, the Court reflected upon the pretence as the
best Artifice they could invent to keep the design private.</p>
            <p>The Prisoners were now called upon to speak for themselves,<note place="margin">The Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses for the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

went out no more that Night: That he was at home the <hi>Saturday Night</hi>
when Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> was murthered, and the next Night, and every
Night so long as the VVitness was in Town; and that she herself was at
home the <hi>Wednesday Night</hi> beforementioned. That she was the more
positive because they kept constant Supper time, and the doors never

opened after; besides that the Lodgings lay so, that no body could go
in or out without being taken notice of, that the Maid kept the Key of
the House and not <hi>Hill.</hi> Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> then informed the Court that
Mrs. <hi>Broadstreet</hi> would own but one Key at first, but before the Duke
of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> she ackowledged six or seven, to which Mrs. <hi>Tilden</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
that there was onely one Key which secur'd that door. The

mistook the month.<note place="margin">Mrs. <hi>Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street</hi> seconds the former Evidence.</note> Mrs. <hi>Broadstreet</hi> being askt what time, answered
in <hi>September,</hi> and then Mrs. <hi>Tilden</hi> recollecting herself, said in <hi>September</hi>
too, and that while she was in Town there was not a day but she went
into the Little Room, mentioned by <hi>Prance,</hi> upon some occasion or
other; Mrs. <hi>Broadstreet</hi> said they came to Town the <hi>Monday</hi> before
<hi>Michaelmas,</hi> affirmed the good hours they kept, and that nothing could
be brought in, but they in the House must know of it. Sir <hi>Robert
Southwel</hi> then described the place, that it was very little, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against
the Dining Room; and that it was a small square Room, where
the body was laid, at the Stairs head. Mrs. <hi>Broadstreet</hi> adding that the
Key was never out of the Door; and people constantly going into that
Room. Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> informed that Mrs. <hi>Broadstreet</hi> told the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> that <hi>Hill</hi> had left his Lodgings before that time. And Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Southwel</hi> said that there had been some dispute about it; <hi>Prance</hi>
would have it to be a fortnight after, and <hi>Hill</hi> affirming that he was
dealing with his Land-Lord the very <hi>Saturday</hi> that Sir <hi>Edmond Godfrey</hi>
was wanting. And that from that time, it was a week or a fortnight
before he removed. But it was urged that <hi>Hill</hi> pretended that he was
gone before. Mrs. <hi>Broadstreet</hi> averring that <hi>Hill</hi> left the Lodgings a

said <hi>Hill</hi> went away only three or four days after. Mrs. <hi>Tilden</hi> said
further, that the place was so streight, that upon an occasion of Visits
the Footmen always waited in that Room.</p>

               </note> upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
for Conspiring the Death of the <hi>King,</hi> and the Subversion of
the <hi>Government,</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi> But <hi>Iames Corker</hi> was
first brought to the Barr, having been arraigned the former Sessions. The
Jury being Sworn, and Admitted without Exception, the Kings Council
(as is usual) opened the Indictment, and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was first produced
and Sworn. And first as to the Plot in <hi>general,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> deposed,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> drawn into the <hi>Plot.</hi>
               </note> That he had some inckling of the <hi>Plot</hi> Seven
years ago, but that <hi>Ewers, Gavan, Peters, Leueson, &amp;c.</hi> had more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
acquainted him with it, about two years since, and drew him
into the Design upon the Government and Religion, and upon killing
the <hi>King,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> That all <hi>Harcourts</hi> Letters were
directed to the VVitness, Eight or Nine at a time; and almost all of
them were concerning the <hi>Plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The scope of the Letters were to Instruct <hi>Ewers</hi> how to proceed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the getting of Money,<note place="margin">The scope of <hi>Harcourts</hi> Letters.</note> and engaging the Gentlemen of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to serve as <hi>Officers</hi> in the Army, which was to be raised upon the
death of the <hi>King.</hi> That he saw Receipts from St. <hi>Omers</hi> of Money paid to
that end. That he received a Letter directed to himself, which came
from <hi>Harcourt;</hi> but who wrote it he could not say, or if it had any date
or no; only he supposes that it came from <hi>beyond-Sea</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and
so to him. It gave Caution to say nothing of Arms, till the King was
dead. He deposed a Correspondency thrice a week betwixt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators
in <hi>London</hi> and the <hi>Staffordshire Agents:</hi> and in a Letter from
<hi>Whitebread, Ewers</hi> was charged to choose <hi>stout</hi> and <hi>hardy</hi> men,<note place="margin">Bold Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters sent by the <hi>Common Post.</hi>
               </note> with
this expression in the Letter, <hi>To kill the King;</hi> which Letter was sent by
the Common Post, and superscribed to Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> who vvas Sworn
to Secrecy by Mr. <hi>Ewers</hi> at least ten times. And the VVitness took the
Sacrament upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:93059:41"/>
He deposeth also,<note place="margin">Several <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs</hi> upon the <hi>King.</hi>
               </note> That <hi>Gavan, Leueson, Ewers,</hi> and my <hi>Lord Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
would have had the VVitness destroy the <hi>King</hi> by Shooting, Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or the like; not so as to do it directly himself, but to come to
<hi>London</hi> for directions how to do it; where Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was to have
him in his Care; and that he was to have come in <hi>October</hi> last, the
Resolution being taken the <hi>Iuly</hi> before. This VVitness also deposed,
That the <hi>Lord Stafford</hi> promised him <hi>Five hundred pounds</hi> in hand
upon his coming to <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>October,</hi> for an Incouragement; but that
a more considerable Reward vvas to follow, and that he should have
come to <hi>London,</hi> if it had not been discovered.</p>
            <p>He deposeth further,<note place="margin">The Letter about Sir <hi>Edm. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey.</hi>
               </note> That he found <hi>Ewers</hi> reading a Letter from

Godfrey <hi>is dispatch'd,</hi> and that it was dated the very Night that he was
killed; <hi>Ewers</hi> shewing the Prisoner the Letter, and telling him also,
that Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury Godfry</hi> was grown too Inquisitive into the Plot,
and it would be well to take him off. Deposing also, that Mr. <hi>Ewers</hi>
shew'd the Prisoner the Letter to comfort him, that one Enemy was
gone; and the VVitness reporting it again to the <hi>Minister</hi> of the
place.</p>
            <p>He deposed further,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> gives 400 <hi>l.</hi> to pray for his <hi>Soul.</hi>
               </note> That the <hi>Protestants</hi> were to be destroyed; and
that they had great confidence in the VVitness: he having given them
<hi>Four hundred pounds,</hi> and promised another Hundred to pray for his
Soul; and Land made over to Mr. <hi>Girald</hi> to raise the Money upon the

            <p>Mr. <hi>Corker</hi> demanded,<note place="margin">

came? and the VVitness not presently recollecting it, the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
appealed to the <hi>Court,</hi> upon the Improbability of sending such a
Letter by the <hi>Common Post,</hi> and yet no appearance either <hi>to</hi> whom, or
<hi>from</hi> whom it came.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> But Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> rendred an Account of other
Letters; one from <hi>Paris</hi> to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and <hi>thence</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and so
to <hi>Tixall;</hi> where it was read in the presence of the Prisoner, by the
Lord <hi>Aston</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ewers;</hi> It was subscribed <hi>I. W.</hi> and thought to be
from Sir <hi>Iohn Warner;</hi> that it was dated from <hi>Paris,</hi> whence they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
the casting of it on the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> after the Death of the
<hi>King,</hi> which would make the <hi>Church of England men</hi> fall in with the
<hi>Papists,</hi> to destroy the Party. This was the <hi>Paris</hi> Letter; and the
<hi>London</hi> Letter approv'd the <hi>Advice</hi> with several Lords hands to them,
in allowance of the design of killing the <hi>KING;</hi> and raising an
<hi>Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prisoner asked,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Corkers</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to the <hi>story.</hi>
               </note> if it were dated from St. <hi>Omers?</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
reply'd, that in the Pacquet from St. <hi>Omers</hi> there were three Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>Paris,</hi> St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> one from each; and all in one Cover,
being cover'd in <hi>Groves</hi> Pacquet: The VVitness averring, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was to be of the party that should kill the <hi>King,</hi> in <hi>October.</hi> The
Prisoner here made a reflection, that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> mentioned only <hi>Three</hi>
designs to kill the <hi>King,</hi> by <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Pickering;</hi> by the <hi>Ruffians,</hi> and
by <hi>Poyson:</hi> and that now a <hi>fourth</hi> was found out in <hi>October,</hi> when the
Design was charged upon <hi>Iuly,</hi> or <hi>August?</hi> But it was reply'd upon
him, That there might be more <hi>Plots</hi> than Docter <hi>Oates</hi> knew
of.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> offer'd, That the VVitnesses Testimony was suspicious,
even from the multitude of Persons employed and intrusted; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
done upon it, where yet a few might have done the business. The
Prisoners were here ordered to wait their time without interposing, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93059:42"/>
the Kings Evidence might be first heard: whereupon the Prisoners desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Pen, Ink, and Paper, which was granted them; and so the Court
proceeded. It was much wondred that any Body should write by the
<hi>Common Post</hi> about killing the <hi>King.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> Answered,
That in case of Discovery it was to be cast upon him, and that he was
under an <hi>Oath</hi> to deny it: Affirming, that the very words were <hi>for the
killing of the King;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Why by the <hi>Common Post.</hi>
               </note> without any Superscription to <hi>Ewers,</hi> or Name to
the Letters. The Prisoners joyned in admiration, at the folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of any man in putting such words in a Letter.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> proceeded,<note place="margin">The <hi>Black Cross</hi> upon <hi>Whitebreads</hi> Letter.</note> That <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s Letter was directed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and that it came in Company with others: that there was a <hi>Black
Cross</hi> upon what he was to deliver to <hi>Ewers;</hi> and that he was to disperse
them where they were to go. But being ask'd by what mark he should
know whither to send them? The Witness answered, that Mr. <hi>Ewers</hi>
knew their hands, and what every thing meant, and for whom it was.
To the Question of <hi>how many Letters?</hi> the Witness answered, that in
two years he believed he had a Hundred, and Mr. <hi>Rumley</hi> asking him
from how many persons? and wondring that he had none of them to
produce; Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> answered, That there were a great many from
Sir <hi>Iohn Warner,</hi> and that so long as he intended to go on with the <hi>Plot,</hi>
he burnt them all; but that he had spoken what he could remember. He
deny'd the seeing of any <hi>Commissions,</hi> but affirmed that he spake with
some that were to be <hi>Officers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> deposed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi> Men to be arm'd.</note> that some <hi>three</hi> weeks before <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> he
heard <hi>Fenwick</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> at Mr. <hi>Irelands</hi> Chamber talking of raising
50000 Men, and settling <hi>Popery:</hi> Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> saying, that it would be
easily done, and encouraging the Prisoner (being a <hi>Silver smith</hi>) with
the hope of work enough, about <hi>Crucifixes, Candlesticks, &amp;c.</hi> naming
the <hi>Lords</hi> that were to Command the Army: And after that he was
told of <hi>Commissions</hi> given out. He deposed further, That my Lord
<hi>Arundels Butler</hi> told him, that one <hi>Messenger</hi> was to murther the <hi>King,</hi>
and this Witness meeting Mr. <hi>Messenger,</hi> and asking him the Question, he
was surprised at it, and said to this Witness, <hi>Pray keep Counsel, for we
are off of that now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Iennison</hi> deposed,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ienni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> That in <hi>Iune</hi> (78) upon a discourse with Mr.
<hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>Russell-street</hi> about Religion (his Sister Mrs. <hi>Aune Ireland</hi>
being by) Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> spake as if the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion would be quickly
settled in <hi>England,</hi> for there was but One stood in the way; and the
<hi>King</hi> might be easily poyson'd. Whereupon this Witness speaking of it
as a horrid thing, Mrs. <hi>Ireland</hi> asked her Brother why he talkt at that
rate? and he qualified the matter as a thing which he thought should not
be done: And then the Witness minding him of the <hi>Gunpowder Treason,</hi>
he said, it was only a trick of <hi>Cecils.</hi> The Witness being at that time a
<hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> but since Converted.</p>
            <p>The VVitness deposeth further,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> positively <hi>Here, Aug.</hi> 19.</note> That he saw Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> positively
on the 19<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>August,</hi> being then newly returned from <hi>Windsor,</hi>
as he remembers punctually, upon very particular Circumstances. The
<hi>Court</hi> looking upon this Evidence as a most eminent Confutation of what
<hi>Ireland</hi> affirmed at his death: which was, that betwixt the <hi>third</hi> of
<hi>August,</hi> and toward the <hi>middle</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> he was never in Town,
but all that time in <hi>Stafford-shire.</hi> Mr. <hi>Iennison</hi> then proceeding, That
upon the 19<hi>th</hi> aforesaid, he saw Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> draw off his <hi>Boots</hi> at his
own Chamber, upon the <hi>Frame of a Table,</hi> as the Witness remembers,
being come post (as he said) out of <hi>Stafford-shire</hi> betimes that Morning.
That the VVitness telling him (upon his question where he had been,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93059:42"/>
and what news?) that he had been at <hi>Windsor,</hi> and that the King
was early up in a Morning, went a <hi>Fishing</hi> and <hi>Hawking:</hi> the VVitness
telling him, of his own accord, that his Majesty had but very little
Company with him. Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> reflected upon the <hi>Kings</hi> going so
thinly guarded,<note place="margin">The <hi>King</hi> easily <hi>taken off.</hi>
               </note> saying, that he <hi>might be easily taken off.</hi> The Witness
replying, <hi>God forbid:</hi> and then Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> smoothing it over, this
Witness thought no more on it, till the Plot was discover'd; and then
he told his <hi>Father and his Sisters</hi> this discourse, saying, that it was very
suspicoius. This VVitness was very sure it was the 19<hi>th,</hi> and knew
Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> very well, having been acquainted with him a year and an
half: And he went out of Town <hi>September</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> into the <hi>North.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Corker</hi> asking the VVitness, when he turned <hi>Protestant?</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting,
that he did not for sake his Religion till he found it might be for
his advantage.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bowes</hi> was then Sworn; who declared, that he saw Mr. <hi>Iennison</hi>
in <hi>Tunbridge</hi> about the beginning or middle of <hi>August:</hi> That he went
then from <hi>Tunbridge.</hi> That the VVitness went to <hi>Windsor, August</hi> the
12<hi>th</hi> or 13<hi>th;</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Iennison</hi> came to <hi>Windsor</hi> when the Witness
was out of Town.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Burnett</hi> deposes, That about the middle of <hi>August,</hi> (the very day
<hi>of Dachett-Horse-Race</hi>) he met Mr. <hi>Iennison</hi> on his way to <hi>Windsor.</hi>
The <hi>Court</hi> declaring this to be a point, that did not concern the Prisoners,
but to shew the falsity of <hi>Irelands</hi> affirmation.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> then made Oath,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence against Sr. <hi>G. Wakeman.</hi>
               </note> That Mr. <hi>Ashby</hi> coming sick to Town in
<hi>Iuly,</hi> Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> prescribed him a course, how he should go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
himself both before he went to <hi>Bath,</hi> and There. That he should
take a pint of Milk morning and evening, and drink nothing else in the
Morning; and at the <hi>Bath</hi> to have a hundred strokes at the <hi>Pump:</hi> Sir
<hi>George</hi> telling him in this Letter <hi>who</hi> would help him to poyson the

and leave the Paper upon the Table with the Ink wet upon it, which was
an <hi>Apothecaries Bill,</hi> (as he supposed) and the same Character with the
Letter to Mr. <hi>Ashby:</hi> and the VVitness swears, that as Sir <hi>George</hi> wrote,
Mr. <hi>Ashby</hi> discours'd to him of a <hi>Commission</hi> received for <hi>Physitian</hi> to the
<hi>Army;</hi> which the Witness saw at Mr. <hi>Ashby's</hi> in Sr. <hi>George's</hi> hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He

that he heard <hi>Ashby,</hi> in the <hi>Provincials</hi> Name, offer 10000 <hi>l.</hi> to Sir
<hi>George</hi> for his reward. This was in <hi>Iuly: Harcourt, Fenwick, Ireland</hi>
and the <hi>Witness</hi> present.</p>
            <p>He deposeth,<note place="margin">Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 15000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </note> that Sir <hi>George</hi> said, That <hi>it was not enough for poysoning
the King,</hi> and so refused it; and that the Fathers met on purpose to deal
with Sir <hi>George</hi> about it, before Mr. <hi>Ashby</hi> went to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and that
upon Sr. <hi>George's</hi> Refusal, they acquainted Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> with it; who
presently gave the <hi>London-Fathers</hi> Commission to offer 5000 <hi>l.</hi> more;
which, as this VVitness is informed, was accepted; and 5000 <hi>l.</hi> of it
paid down: The VVitness having seen Sir <hi>Georges</hi> Name subscribed to
the <hi>Entry-Book;</hi> wherein was specified such a proposal to Sr. <hi>George,</hi>
with his Acceptance of 5000 <hi>l.</hi> and Receipt in part of 15000 <hi>l.</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt

accepted. The <hi>Entry-Book</hi> it self being in the <hi>Fathers</hi> custody, at

could write it but himself. And Sr. <hi>George</hi> charging him with declaring,
that he did not know the Prisoners hand; the <hi>Doctor</hi> affirmed, that a
Letter that he saw signed <hi>G. Wakeman,</hi> was the same hand-writing
with that of the <hi>Receipt,</hi> and the <hi>Physick-Bill.</hi> Sir <hi>George</hi> demanded
a positive Answer,<note place="margin">The Doctor, charg'd with a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Doz'd with setting up.</note> but now that he

he had to ask might be put to the <hi>Court;</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> not calling to mind
<hi>whether he said he knew Sir</hi> George, <hi>or not:</hi> but affirming this to be
the person that was called Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> but not able to say that
it was the person that attended the <hi>Council,</hi> when the Witness was
there. The <hi>Doctor</hi> deposing likewise, that he saw Sir <hi>George</hi> two seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
days at Mr. <hi>Ashbyes</hi> Chamber; and that he never saw him before,
and but once after, which was at <hi>Wild-house</hi> when the 10000 <hi>l.</hi> was
offer'd; where Mr. <hi>Ashby</hi> lay in <hi>Iuly,</hi> before he went to the <hi>Bath,</hi> which
was about the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> or beginning of <hi>August;</hi> his stay in Town

That if this Evidence had been given there, he must doubtless have been
Committed; but the Prisoner was directed, to reservo what he had to

that he had a Patent to be <hi>Bishop of London;</hi> which the VVitness saw

name to it; and that he did not know whose Hand it was. It was then
considered, that the Witnesse's Paper could not be the Letter Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
reflected upon, having neither Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Hand, nor his Name to't, as
was presum'd of the <hi>Other.</hi> Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> then deny'd the writing
any other Letter, then that of his Servant by his Dictate, which <hi>Ashby</hi>
carry'd to the <hi>Bath:</hi> and saith that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> had charg'd him before the
Lords but with One Letter. And then reasoning upon it, that if he had
been conscious of any Guilt, he had time enough to make his Escape;
challenged any man to prove, that he had any thing more to do with
<hi>Ashby,</hi> then as a <hi>Physician</hi> with his <hi>Patient;</hi> and alledged, that a <hi>Physician</hi>
here in the Town would testifie, that they two had been joyn'd in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations

a kind of a Gentile Hand. Sir <hi>George</hi> appealing to all the world, that
<hi>Milk</hi> was direct Poyson in the Case. But Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> inform'd the Court,
that he was to take the Milk in <hi>Town.</hi> Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> opposing, that
it could not be; for he staid but two days after the writing of that Letter.
It came then to be consider'd, that this could not be the <hi>same</hi> Letter.
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> confirming it also; and that the prescription of <hi>Milk</hi> was after
the first line or two of Complement; and that there was nothing of a <hi>Latin
Recipe</hi> in it. Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> observed to the <hi>Iury,</hi> that admitting any
other Letter then this in Court, he must write two Receipts for the same
thing; which was very improbable. And that the Reason of his Hand not
being to it, was, his being ill, and asleep, when his man (who wrote it
over again from a foul Copy) went away with it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chapman</hi> repeating the Order of the Prescription,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>G.</hi> owning One, and no more.</note> and declaring
that he follow'd it at the <hi>Bath,</hi> for six days together; Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> deposed,
that there was no <hi>Bolus</hi> in the other Letter; nor what <hi>Bath</hi> he should go to,
as was in This; and that therefore it could not be the <hi>same</hi> Letter. Besides,
that it was written above ten days before Mr. <hi>Asbby</hi> went away. Sir <hi>George</hi>
objecting, that there was no need of telling him of his Course in the <hi>Bath,</hi>
so long before he went thither.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Servant inform'd the Court,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Servant proves the Letter.</note> that telling his Master that Mr. <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>

he bad the Witness take Pen and Ink, and write; and making some
mistakes, his Master bad him mend it; and so he interlin'd the Corrections.
That this Witness wrote it fair that night, and carry'd it next morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Master wak'd, to Mr. <hi>Ashby,</hi> who was then going for the <hi>Bath.</hi>
The Witness declaring, that he knew nothing of Mr. <hi>Ashby's</hi> drinking of
<hi>Milk,</hi> onely that a Friend of his had advis'd him to it. But Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that he himself was with him, and that he drank it Night and

Wherein the Court was satisfy'd as to the Truth of the Evidence, but that
this could not be the same Letter Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> spoke of; for That was written
<hi>Ten days</hi> before Mr. <hi>Ashby</hi> went to the <hi>Bath.</hi> Whereupon Mrs. <hi>Hevening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

upon the Letter now in question to the House of Commons
Bar, they sent an Address to the Lords, with admiration that the present
Prisoner was not confined: and that thereupon Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was sent for to
the Lords Bar, to repeat the Story; and mentioning the Letter Now in
debate, he consest there, that <hi>he did not know Sir George Wakeman</hi>'s <hi>Hand;
and onely knew it to be His Letter, by being subscribed</hi> G. Wakeman. Sir <hi>George</hi>
reasoning upon it, that the Witness would have told more, if he had known
it, at That Examination.</p>

he could not perfect his Charge; and that he (the Dr.) did speak the
whole Truth of his knowledge, as far as he was able; denying that he said
he onely knew Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Hand, because <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was subscribed.
Which Sir <hi>G. W.</hi> opposed; and offer'd to make good his Contradiction by
the <hi>Record.</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> deposed, that he could not perfectly remember
the very words; but that if the Prisoner prov'd them by an Oath upon
the <hi>Record,</hi> it must be referr'd to the <hi>Iury.</hi> But to the best of his memory,
upon asking him about Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi>'s Hand, he said, that he saw a

<hi>Coleman</hi> had paid Sir <hi>George 5000 li.</hi> in part of 15000 <hi>li.</hi> which he was to
have. That Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> being call'd, and advertis'd of this Charge,
he did not onely deny the whole matter, and appear otherwise unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
but mov'd it, as a reasonable thing, that he might have Reparation
for the Scandall. This behaviour of his was ill taken, and it was found
reasonable to enquire farther into the matter; but the Evidence coming
onely from a <hi>Third-hand Letter,</hi> Sir <hi>George</hi> was not committed. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
being call'd in again, was demanded what he could say of his own perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

            <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> did very candidly represent to the Court,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> explains himself.</note> that he onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd

for in case he should have made such answer as is informed against
him, it was known to the whole board that he was, at that time, hardly
<hi>Compos mentis,</hi> and scarce in condition to return an answer. But that this

acquaint the Board with Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi>'s Letter; but he would
not be positive.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> was then examined as to the Letter:<note place="margin">No mention of Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi>'s Letter, before the Council.</note> who informed,

that <hi>they were such a Council as would commit no body.</hi> Which was
reflected upon by the Court, as unadvisedly said.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lydcot</hi> was call'd,<note place="margin">A Copy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd of the Lords <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Lydcot</hi> could not say; onely that it was copied from Mr. <hi>Rolph</hi>'s Hand.

<hi>Sunday afternoon,</hi> (as the <hi>Deponent</hi> remembred) Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was then exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd;
and the Council sitting very long, he was appointed that night to
search again, when he seiz'd several Priests and Papers; the night being
wet having much disorder'd him. On <hi>Monday morning</hi> he was examin'd
before the Council again, and at night in so feeble a condition as ever the
Witness saw any man. Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> offer'd, that he appear'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Sunday,</hi> and so was dismist again, till the King himself might have the
hearing of the business the next day. Sir <hi>Thomas Doleman</hi> than proceeded,
that Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was then call'd in, and deliver'd such an Answer,
that the Council very much wonder'd at the manner of it: several persons
being of opinion, that his Denial was not so point-blank as it might have
been; insisting much upon his Loyalty to the Crown, and Reparation
upon a point of Honour.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> inform'd the Court,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi>'s Plea before the Council.</note> that being charg'd with Treason

But these were look'd upon as matters of no weight. The Prisoner then
reflected upon the Doctour's deposing him to be <hi>President</hi> of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
whereas <hi>Stapilton</hi> is known to have been President of it for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

            <p>The Prisoner being put to prove who was the <hi>President</hi> of the Order,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Corker</hi> denies all.</note>
not being provided with Witnesses at hand, spake himself; denying any
Letter, either written, or received, as was suggested; any privity to such
a Consult about the Mony; or any necessity for his being at it, if the thing
had been true. And arguing, that in reason, if he had been in the Conspiracy
with <hi>Pickering,</hi> when <hi>Pickering</hi> was taken, he would certainly have fled.</p>
            <p>And as to his Exception against <hi>Pickering,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He says that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> did not know him.</note> because no <hi>Lay-brother;</hi> the
Dr. knowing <hi>Pickering</hi> so well, and himself being present at the taking of
him, it seemed strange that he should neither know, nor charge, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
him the Prisoner, untill near a Month after: especially the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
coming to this Prisoner's Chamber, when they seiz'd <hi>Pickering.</hi> But
Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> hearing afterward that the Prisoner had lodg'd there, enter'd
him in his List, and so took him. Whereas, if (as Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> says) the
Prisoner was a Fellow-Criminal with <hi>Pickering,</hi> he being then in quest
of the Conspiratours, it was his duty to have taken them both together.
Beside that the Prisoner's Name not being upon the Doctour's Catalogue,
he thought might acquit him.</p>
            <p>But the Prisoner being over-rul'd in it, that what he offer'd, was no
Evidence, he recommended himself to the Jury, to lay it to their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
whether they did not assent to him in the Truth of this matter.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> being now ask'd what he had to say, spake to this effect:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi>'s Defence.</note>
That upon notice, a month agoe, of coming speedily to his Trial, he had
bethought himself of his Defence; and with good hope to acquit himself.
But reflecting upon the Issue of the late Trials, he had once resolved to
submit all to the Sentene of the Court and the Jury, without a word
speaking. But that being now encourag'd by the Candour and Equity of
the Proceeding, he made it his humble suit to the Honourable Bench, to
take into their own Menage the Cause of the Prisoner. Passing from
thence to a slight reflection upon Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow;</hi> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
to the Unconcernedness upon him at his Apprehension, there being
no Warrant out against him, nor any Charge of Treason lying upon him:
But that coming by chance to enquire for one where they were upon a
Search, though he saw the Officer at the door, and Candles up and down
the house, yet he went forward; as all the people can testify, and Sir
<hi>Willam Waller</hi> also, that took him.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> being called,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> speaks to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him.</note> deposed to this point, that going to

body out: and that the Prisoner came and knockt at the door, (as Sir
<hi>William</hi> supposed,) not knowing of any Search in the house. But being
let in, and finding how it was, he did what he could to get away again.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> begging pardon for the Contradiction,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> defends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> affirmed with a
solemn asseveration, that he enter'd without knocking, (the door being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen)
and so went in of his own accord, as the Constable would bear him
Witness. And for his endeavour to get away again, he affirm'd, that while
they were searching within, he continu'd in an Out-room, the Constable
and others with him wondering, when he came back, that the Prisoner was
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93059:47"/>
not gone. The Prisoner affirming likewise, that he was left at the door alone:
and beside, that he could have slipt out at another door, into an <hi>Alley,</hi>
which he had the trick of opening while a man might speak three words.
The Prisoner insisting upon this Confidence, as an argument of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:
saying farther, that be was spoken to to take off his Perriwigg,
and stand with his back to Sir <hi>William</hi> and Dr. <hi>Oates;</hi> which the Prisoner
did not understand. But Sir <hi>William</hi> being so kind afterwards as to see him
at the <hi>Gate-house,</hi> with two worthy Gentlemen, Sir <hi>Philip Matthews</hi> and
Sir <hi>Iohn Cuttler,</hi> upon the Prisoner's affirming that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was wholly a
Stranger to him, the Prisoner was told, that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> (as a token that he
knew him) describ'd a certain Mark upon the Hind-part of his Head:
the Prisoner offering himself to the Company, to see if there were
any such thing or no. The Prisoner did now desire, that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> might
give an accompt of that Mark; and that the Jury would believe of him
according as they found it true or false. Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> inform'd the
Court, that he knew nothing of any Mark; but that Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> when he
came in, call'd the Prisoner by his name. Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> excus'd the Trouble
he had given the Court, his Defence depending upon the Proof of Doctour
<hi>Oates</hi>'s being a Stranger to him; desiring the Jury to observe, that such a
Description was given; Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> owning a desire to see him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Perriwigg, to look if he had a Shaven Crown: which Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi>
said, Sir <hi>William</hi> must needs know could not be; it being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perss

Sir <hi>William</hi> refused; but promised to commit it to memory. Hereupon
the Prisoner did now adjure Sir <hi>William</hi> as a worthy Gentleman, and as he
should answer for it at the Last day, to be as good as his word. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
said farther, that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> looking hard upon him, askt him what
his Name was: which shew'd him to be a Stranger. And upon the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's
owning his Name to be <hi>Marshall;</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> told him, that he was
call'd <hi>Marsh.</hi> Urging it, that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> seeing the Prisoner; saying that
he did not know them; leaving them in bed, and at liberty to be gone;
and he himself declaring that he was looking for Traitours; the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
left the Jury to judge, whether he had any thing to charge upon
them. Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> protested solemnly, that there was nothing of
all this. <hi>Marshall</hi> exclaiming, that he was astonish'd; and affirming,
that upon a Controversie with Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> about it, Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> the Constable
averr'd it, and promised to attend in Court to make it good. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
averring, that he askt Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> why he did not seize him before,
when he was searching for Traitours, if he knew the Prisoner to be a
Traitour: whose answer was, before Sir <hi>William,</hi> that at That time he
had no Commission to seize him. But Sir <hi>William</hi> remember'd nothing of
This neither. Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> then ask'd Sir <hi>William,</hi> if he remember'd what
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> said upon a question of his seeing the Prisoner last Summer;
which was, that he saw him <hi>Iune, Iuly,</hi> and <hi>August.</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>
calling to mind something of That; Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> averr'd that he could
prove himself in <hi>Warwickshire</hi> all those three Months; but that his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
were not here; and that it was impossible to foresee what points
would come in question. Whereupon he did submissiverly desire respite

                  <hi>Corker</hi> not <hi>President,</hi> as pretended.</note> who was President of the <hi>Benedictines,</hi> the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
answered, Mr. <hi>Stapilton;</hi> and that he had been so several Years: and
that she was certain that <hi>Corker</hi> never officiated in that place. And being
ask'd, if ever she had seen Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> or Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> there in the house; she (the
Witness) answer'd, that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> came to Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> for a Charity that
Summer was twelvemonth; and that Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> forbad his coming into
the house. Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> collecting from that Evidence, that This being
charg'd for the very Nick of time to advance the <hi>Plot,</hi> it was not probable
that they would treat so necessary an Instrument in it at that rate. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
repeating his desire onely of 3 or 4 days time, to provide his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses:
reasoning upon the Thing, that if his Life might justly be sav'd, he
did presume that the Court would not have him lose it. But it was urg'd,
on the other side, that he had notice long enough to have brought them
up; and that the <hi>Iury</hi> must be now kept together till they give up their
<hi>Verdict.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Shelden</hi> informed,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Stapilton</hi> President of the <hi>Benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>
               </note> that Mr. <hi>Stapilton</hi> was at present (and
had been for four or five years last past, to her knowledge) President of,
the <hi>Benedictine Monks.</hi> And <hi>Alice Broadhead</hi> informed likewise to the same
effect. Upon which Evidence Mr. <hi>Corker</hi> raised this Inference, That Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s
Accusation was of no validity, depending wholly upon the Prisoner's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>President,</hi> and consenting to the Plot under that qualification.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners plead Innocence.</note> with a soleman Imprecation, disclaimed all the
Crime in this matter that was charg'd upon him. And so likewise did
Mr. <hi>Corker:</hi> renouncing both the Doctrine of moving a Sedition for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and all power of <hi>Dispensation</hi> for so doing. Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> was more
Copious and Rhetorical; and more upon <hi>Perswasion</hi> then <hi>Defence.</hi> So
that the Lord Chief Justice (after some short Remerks upon the <hi>Romish
Principles</hi>) summ'd up the Evidence,<note place="margin">And brought in <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
               </note> and gave directions to the <hi>Iury:</hi>
who after an hour's Consideration returned the Prisoners <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
