            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Eyen the days of Baptiſme, likewiſe how long preached, to ſuch diſobedient ſpirits; as far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>his right foot on the waters,</hi> and <hi>his left on the earth:</hi> The times meaſured, the firſt <hi>Noahs</hi> dayes, by the ſecond <hi>Noahs</hi> dayes: to wit, in the ſeventeenth Century, his coming in the clouds, who rewards every one according to his ſervice; For the name of a Chriſtian ſerves not; But his end worſe then his beginning.

            </p>
            <p>So farther with That paſt, comparing This troubleſome time: When all the city ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and He who mockd with God, faining He would worſhip him, was himſelf mockd; after they made of his Counſell, having ſent them to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> &amp;c. in revenge fell upon poor Innocents, under ſuch an age ſpared none; who to that Fox returnd not any more, but went another way, ſuppoſing before their God they ſhould have obeyed him: Whoſe Treaſure then they laid it at his feet; given as it were to the Churches uſe; made their Omage there.</p>

            <p>And thou <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> none of the greateſt, yet makes up the Harmony, before the wedding all rejoycing; The trees of the Wood alſo utter their ayrie voice, where the Court of Guards ſervice weil worth the marking and obſervation; thoſe Bulwarks there ſo watcht round about; and here to proceed with the everlaſting Word of God; there the flaming ſword alſo; the Tree of Life

            <p>And thus, as the way ſhewed where kept now the Tree of Life; ſo farthermore of what nature it is; a Tree hard and ſtony, the Fruit not to be medled with, or toucht at firſt; though none more mellow and ſoft then it afterward; and becauſe of a reſtraining vertue, its good Name taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, like the Medlars crowned fruit miſcalled.</p>
            <p>And ſo another place belonging to the city, in theſe dayes of ſuch diſtraction, worthy to be thought upon, <hi>Bethlehems</hi> Hoſpitall, <hi>Their Houſe of Bread;</hi> for the witleſſe ſent to This, as the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the other, thoſe Sages, &amp;c. in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to That not inferior, where ſome Barn or the like, made the Bed-chamber of the bleſſed Lady; and He there born, our Bread from heaven, and for a ſigne given the Shepherds, of his rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the croſſe, that was put into the Rack or Manger; and by a Woman aforehand anointed; and other like ſignes and tokens.</p>
            <p>Whether theſe betoken nothing too, appeal to the wiſdom of our age; or to be ſuch an unlikely thing; that he who wrote that brotherly Epiſtle (going before the <hi>Apocalypſe)</hi> to a Lady, ſaying, <hi>He had many things to write unto her.</hi> Whatſoever it was which appears not there, but referred to another

            <p>And the Nations angry for that time of wrath come; The time of the dead to be judged, <hi>(Rev.</hi> 11) ſhews the Churches Intelligence aforehand of that time; far be it from us to be like the deaf Adder; That becauſe once accurſed for harkning when forbidden.

            <p>Thus from that preſaging place or Name of <hi>Englands</hi> bloody Field: <hi>Englefield</hi> neer <hi>Reading-Town,</hi> where the Term kept, that remarkable yeer, for ſo many Examples of Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries produced.</p>
