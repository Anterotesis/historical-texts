            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>
                  <hi>PSALM.</hi> 75. 2, 3.</bibl>
               <q>When I shall receiue the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (<hi>or, when I shall take a conuenient time</hi>) I will iudge according vnto right. The earth is dissolued, (<hi>or, melted</hi>) and all the inhabitants thereof; I beare up the pillars of it.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS <hi>Psalme</hi> is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a kinde of Dialogue betweene God and the Prophet. For <hi>David</hi> som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times speaks in his owne person, and sometimes in Gods. Some thinke the time, when hee sung this <hi>Psalme,</hi> was, when he was now ready to be crowned king ouer <hi>Israel,</hi> aswell as <note place="margin">2. Reg 5.</note>


               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:8785:3"/>
               <hi>Iuda.</hi> The occasion of this his solemne deuotion was, not onely the care which hee had of the world in generall, the <hi>earth,</hi> but much more, and much neerer the care which hee tooke of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Israel,</hi> now committed by God vnto his Gouernement. That King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was then filled with ciuill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustions; and the Church (as it vses to be in a troubled State) was out of order too.</p>
            <p>The Learned, both the Fathers, and the later Diuines, differ much about my Text. For some will read it <hi>Time;</hi> and some, <hi>The Congregation.</hi> And the best is, there's warrantable authoritie for both. Againe, some will haue it, that this speech (<hi>I will iudge acoording vnto right</hi>) is <hi>Dauids</hi> promise to God, of his iust ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Kingdome; and some, that it is <hi>Gods</hi> promise to <hi>Dauid,</hi> of his Grace and Assistance, to inable him so to gouerne. If it be Gods speech, they are not all agreed, neither whether it be meant of his temporary execution of


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8785:3"/>
Iudgement in this life; or of his great and finall iudgement. Nor do they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, whether by the <hi>Earth,</hi> bee meant the whole <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> spread ouer it; or the <hi>kingdome of the Iewes,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> as then conteined in it. But the matter is not great. For the Scripture is not onely <hi>true,</hi> but <hi>full</hi> in all these sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and all of them come in close vpon the letter of the Text. And therefore for ought I know, it is the safest way, which shuts out nothing that the Text includes. And my Text will easily take in all, if you consider the wordes, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> speech; yet so, as that one way <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> be vnderstood to speake in his owne person; and another way in Gods.</p>
            <p>And this is no newes. For vsually in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> one and the same speech is meant of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Christ;</hi> and one and the same action applyed to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi> And the reason of this is plaine: For the <hi>King</hi> is Gods immediate <hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> vpon earth; and therefore one and the same <hi>action</hi> is Gods by ordinance, and


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8785:4"/>
the Kings by execution. And the power which resides in the King, is not any assuming to himselfe, nor any gift from the people, but Gods power, aswellin, as ouer him. <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> stand very neere together. And it is an infinite blessing both vpon the King, and the people, when the Kings heart keepes as neere vnto God, as Gods power is to the King. For then t'is but reading of my Text, and you both see and enioy the blessing presently.</p>
            <p>For then the <hi>Congregation</hi> that comes vp, the <hi>great Congregation; great</hi> in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>great</hi> in place, and <hi>great</hi> in power, it shall not loose it's labour. For, <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it,</hi> saith God; and <hi>I,</hi> saith the King. The Congregation, whether it bee to serue God, or the State, or both, comes vp at an appointed time; and, <hi>I will make a conuenient time for it;</hi> saith God; and <hi>I wil take a conuenient time for it,</hi> saith the King. <hi>When I haue receiued it,</hi> and in this <hi>time, I will iudge</hi> in it, and by it, <hi>according vnto</hi>


               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:8785:4"/>
               <hi>right,</hi> saith God; and <hi>I,</hi> saith the King. If <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Iudgement</hi> bee not executed, the <hi>Earth</hi> will <hi>dissolue,</hi> the Kingdomes will <hi>melt</hi> away, all things will <hi>sinke</hi> and <hi>fall;</hi> but <hi>I will beare vp the pillars of it,</hi> saith God; and <hi>I,</hi> saith the King. If the <hi>Earth dissolue,</hi> the Militant Church which dwells vpon it <hi>shakes</hi> presently. It must needs beare part with the State in which it is; but <hi>I will beare vp the pillars of that</hi> too, saith God; and <hi>I,</hi> saith the King. So blessed a thing it is, where God and the King keepe neere, and worke together.</p>
            <p>The Text hath <hi>Two</hi> parts. The one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is the state of the <hi>Earth,</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and the <hi>Inhabitors</hi> thereof; and they, when the Prophet wrote this, were in weake estate, <hi>melted,</hi> and <hi>dissolued.</hi> The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> other is, the <hi>Remedie,</hi> which God and the King will take to settle it. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Remedie, heere are <hi>Three</hi> things expressed. First, the Execution of Iustice, <hi>I will iudge according vnto right.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Secondly, the Establishment, or settling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>


               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:8785:5"/>
of the Pillars, <hi>I beare top the pillars of it.</hi> Thirdly, the Time for both these, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that is <hi>a conuenient Time,</hi> euen <hi>when Hee shall receiue the Congregation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin at the state in which <hi>Dauid,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> when hee came to the Crowne, found the <hi>Earth,</hi> the world in generall; the Kingdome of <hi>Iuda</hi> in particular; and the Church of God.</p>
            <p>And surely my Text giues mee no hope, but <hi>Liquefacta est, weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>dissolution,</hi> and <hi>melting</hi> in them <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> all.</p>
            <p>For the world first, that so farre as the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchie preuailed, in those dayes of <hi>Dauid, melted</hi> betweene riot and crueltie. And the rest of the world which was not vnder them, was broken and dissolued into petty <hi>Dyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties</hi> and <hi>Gouernements;</hi> which did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing almost but prey one vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And for the Kingdome of <hi>Iuda,</hi> (the speciall ayme of my Text) that <hi>mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> first in the great disobedience of <hi>Saul,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Reg. 15. 23.</note> and after that in ciuill dissentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8785:5"/>
               <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> the sonne of <hi>Saul,</hi> for diuers yeeres together. And as for the Church, that had no publicke roome then giuen it, but in <hi>Iudea;</hi> and there it could not stand fast when the <hi>Earth melted</hi> vnder it. And we finde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of <hi>Saul,</hi> 85. Priests were <note place="margin">1. Reg. 22.</note> put to the sword at once, and vniustly all. And the Church cannot choose but <hi>melt</hi> when her Priests are slaine: for the speediest <hi>melting</hi> that is, is to <hi>melt</hi> in blood.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>melting,</hi> whether it bee in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> State or Church, is no small thing. For the Scripture when it would expresse a great Calamitie vpon <hi>men</hi> or <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> vses the word <hi>melting,</hi> or <hi>dissoluing.</hi> And that shewes that their honour and strength drops away and decayes, till they become as nothing, or quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. In trouble, the heart of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid melted like waxe, Psal</hi> 22. When their <note place="margin">Psal. 22. 18.</note> enemies preuailed, The heart of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>melted like water, Ios. 7.</hi> In the time <note place="margin">Iosua 7. 5.</note> of vengeance, The vngodly of the Earth


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8785:6"/>
shall <hi>melt and consume away like a snaile, Psal.</hi> 58. And that's <hi>melting</hi> indeed: Put <note place="margin">Psal. 58. 7.</note> but a little falt vpon a snaile, and he will drop out of his house presently.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Melting</hi> then is a great Calamity vpon a Kingdome. And 'tis not <hi>Iuda</hi> onely, but all Kingdomes of the Earth are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to <hi>melting.</hi> The many changes of the world haue Preach'd this ouer and ouer; That whatsoeuer hath Earth to the foundation, is subiect to <hi>dissolution.</hi> And the Sermon is still made vpon this Text, <hi>Terra liquefacta est:</hi> The Earth is <hi>dissolued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now vsually before <hi>melting</hi> there goes a <hi>Heate:</hi> And so it was, <hi>Hos.</hi> 8. A <hi>fire</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
               <note place="margin">Hos. 8. 14.</note> first, and then the <hi>melting</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi> There neither is, nor can bee any Kingdome, but it hath many <hi>Heates.</hi> These are most felt by them, that are at the <hi>working</hi> of the State. But these are all quite aboue me, saue to pray for their <hi>temper:</hi> and I will not further meddle with them. <hi>Heates</hi> then there are, but all <hi>Heates</hi> are not by and by a <hi>Furnace;</hi> nor are all <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces</hi>


               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:8785:6"/>
able to <hi>melt</hi> and <hi>dissolue</hi> States. No God forbid.</p>
            <p>Not all, but yet some there are, that can <hi>melt</hi> any kingdome, especially <hi>two.</hi> The one of these <hi>Heates</hi> is <hi>Sinne,</hi> great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and multiplied <hi>sinne.</hi> For (saith <hi>S.

               <hi>sinne,</hi> is to <hi>melt,</hi> and drop away from all steddinesse in vertue, from all foundation of Iustice.

               <hi>who</hi> it is that <hi>melts</hi> great and glorious Kingdomes.

makes his <hi>fire</hi> so hote, as to <hi>melt,</hi> or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue a Kingdome. The <hi>sinnes</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morite</hi> not yet full, therefore not yet cast <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 16.</note> into the <hi>melting</hi> pot. But so soone as their <hi>sinnes</hi> were <hi>full,</hi> their State <hi>melted.</hi> The fruit of it from aboue, and the root <note place="margin">Amos 2. 9.</note> of it from beneath, all destroyed. And this was not the <hi>Amorites</hi> case onely; for all Stories are ful of it, That when States haue <hi>melted</hi> into wanton, and lustfull <hi>sinnes,</hi> they haue not long after <hi>dissolued</hi> into desolation. For (as <hi>S.

            <p>Well, when t'is <hi>Terra liquefacta,</hi> when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> a Kingdome <hi>dissolues</hi> and <hi>melts,</hi> what then? What? why then no man is in safety, till it settle againe; not a man. For the Text goes on: <hi>The earth is dissolued, and all that dwell therein.</hi> All men then to seeke what to doe; the wisest to seeke, and the strongest to seeke, All. And it


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8785:7"/>
must needes be so. For so long as a State is <hi>Terra,</hi> like solide ground, men know where to set their footing; and it is not euery <hi>Earth-quake,</hi> that swallowes the place. But when it is once <hi>Terra lique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facta, molten</hi> and <hi>dissolued,</hi> there is no foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, no foundation then. <hi>I sticke fast in</hi>

            <p>And when a Kingdome <hi>melts</hi> indeed, that is, both wayes, In <hi>sinne,</hi> and vnder <hi>punishment,</hi> there's great reason the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants should <hi>melt</hi> with it into <hi>feare,</hi> into <hi>danger,</hi> into <hi>ruine.</hi> For God neuer puts his <hi>fire</hi> to the <hi>melting</hi> of a State, but for <hi>sinne,</hi> and sinne, that is neuer committed by the dead State, but by the liuing. For when <hi>a fruitfull land is made barren,</hi> it is <hi>for the wickednesse of them that dwell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal 107. 34.</note> And therefore there is great reason, when the <hi>earth dissolues,</hi> that the <hi>inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi> should all sweat, and <hi>melt</hi> too.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Dauid</hi> came to the Crowne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>


               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:8785:8"/>
t'was thus. How is it now? Why, if you take the <hi>earth</hi> at large, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes about you, out of question there hath beene <hi>liquefactio; a melting</hi> in the <hi>earth,</hi> and many Kingdomes haue <hi>swet blood.</hi> But if you take the <hi>earth</hi> for the State at home, then t'is high time to magnifie God: First, for the Renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Religious, and peaceable Reigne of our late dread Soueraigne of blessed Memorie, who for so many yeeres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, kept this Kingdome in peace, and from <hi>melting:</hi> And secondly, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> now in the change of Princes, (which is not the least occasion for a State to <hi>melt</hi>) wee liue to see a miracle, <hi>Change</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prou. 28. 2.</note> without <hi>Alteration.</hi> Another King; but the same life-expression of all the Royall and Religious Vertues of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and no sinewes shrinking, or <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing</hi> in the State.</p>
            <p>If you aske me the cause of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, I can direct you to no other but God, and God in mercie. For as for the Kingdome, that is made of the same


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8785:8"/>
               <hi>Earth</hi> with others, and is consequently subiect to the same <hi>dissolution.</hi> And as for vs that dwell therein, I doubt our <hi>sinnes</hi> haue been as clamorous vpon God to heate his <hi>fire,</hi> and make it fall on <hi>mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> as the <hi>sinnes</hi> of them that <hi>inhabit</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countreys.</p>
            <p>And though I doubt not but God hath the sure mercies of <hi>Dauid</hi> in store for the King, and will neuer faile him, yet if <hi>Habitatores in ed,</hi> they that dwell in this good and happy soile, will bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it and themselues with <hi>sinne,</hi> great <hi>sinne,</hi> multiplied <hi>sinne,</hi> vnrepented <hi>sinne;</hi> it will not be in the power, or wisdome, or courage, or piety of a King, to keepe the State from <hi>melting.</hi> For <hi>Dauid</hi> was all these, and yet <hi>liquefacta est terra,</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> was as good as <hi>dissolued</hi> for all that. And therefore that this Kingdome is not a <hi>melting</hi> too, I can giue no firme rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but God and his Mercy. For hee is content to giue longer day for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and repentance is able to doe all things with God. And the time calles


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8785:9"/>
apace for repentance: The Heauens they <hi>melt</hi> into vnseasonable weather; and the Earth <hi>melts</hi> and <hi>dissolues</hi> her Inhabitants into infectious humours; and there's no way to stay these <hi>meltings,</hi> but by <hi>mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> our selues, in, and by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>Would you then haue a settled and a flourishing State? Would you haue no <hi>melting,</hi> no <hi>dissolution</hi> in the Church? I know you would, it is the honourable and religious designe of you all: Why, but if you would indeed, The King must <note place="margin">Tene magis sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num populus velit, an popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Tu.</note> trust, and indeere his people: The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple must honour, obey, and support their <note place="margin">Seruat in ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guo qui consulit &amp; Tibi, &amp; vrti Iupiter. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. li. 1. ep. 16.</hi>
               </note> King: Both King, and Peeres, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple must religiously serue and honour God; shut out all Superstition on Gods Name, the farther the better; but let in no prophanenesse therewhile. If this bee not done, take what care you can, God is aboue all humane wisedome, and in some degree or other there will bee <hi>Liquefactio terrae,</hi> a <hi>melting,</hi> or a waste, both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:8785:9"/>
And this falls in vpon the second <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> generall part of the Text; which is The <hi>Remedy,</hi> as it was then with the Iewes, The <hi>Preuention,</hi> as it is now with vs; which God and the King will vse to keepe the State and the Church from <hi>melting.</hi> This Remedy (and the Preuention is iust the same) is expressed first in the Execution of <hi>Iustice.</hi> And this God promises for the King; and the King promises vnder God. <hi>I will iudge according vnto right,</hi> saith God; and <hi>I,</hi> saith the King.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Iudgement</hi> is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test binder vp of a State; The great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> bounder of Peace and Warre. And it is not possible to finde <hi>dissoluing</hi> sinews in a Kingdome, that is gouerned by <hi>Iustice.</hi> For if the King flourish, the Kingdome cannot <hi>melt:</hi> And the Kings Throne, <note place="margin">Prou. 19. 12.</note> that is established by <hi>Iustice.</hi> Nay farther; Nothing but <hi>Iustice</hi> can establish the Throne, and make it firme indeed. But when God blesses the King with a heart full of <hi>Iustice,</hi> when God strengthens the


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8785:10"/>
King in the Execution of <hi>Iustice,</hi> when the King followes God as close as hee can, with <hi>Ego iudicabo,</hi> I my selfe will looke to the administration of <hi>Iustice,</hi> with which God hath trusted me; there can bee no <hi>melting</hi> about the Throne of the King, none in the State, none in the Church.</p>
            <p>But then this Iustice, which preserues the King, and blesses the people, must be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> habituall. To doe <hi>Iustice</hi> casually, though the thing done be <hi>iust,</hi> yet the doing of it is not <hi>Iustice.</hi> The State may <hi>melt</hi> for all that, because the <hi>Remedy</hi> is but casuall.</p>
            <p>Againe, since the whole State hath interest in the <hi>Iustice</hi> of the King, his <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> must be spreading ouer all persons, and in all causes. And so 'tis plurall in the Text, <hi>I will iudge, Iusticias,</hi> for euery <note place="margin">Septnag. S. Hier. Ar. Mont.</note> mans cause, so farre as it is <hi>iust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why, but then must the King doe all this himselfe? No, God forbid that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> should lye vpon him? <hi>Moses</hi> was <note place="margin">Erod. 18. 18.</note> not able alone for that. It was, and it is too heauy. What then? why then <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro's</hi>


               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:8785:10"/>
counsell must bee followed. There must bee inferiour <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi> deputed by the King for this: <note place="margin">V. 21.</note> Men of courage, fearing God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Couetousness. These must quit <hi>Moses</hi> from the inferiour trouble, that he may be actiue, and able for the great affaires of State. For if they be suffered to <hi>melt</hi> and drop downeward, there can be no standing dry or safe vnder them.</p>
            <p>And hence it followes, that, <hi>Ego iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabo, I will iudge according vnto right,</hi> is not onely the Kings engagement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God, and the People; but it is the engagement of euery Iudge, Magistrate, and Officer betweene God, the King, and the State. The Kings power, that's from God. The Iudges, and the subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Magistrates power, that's from the King. Both are for the good of the people, <hi>That they may lead a peaceable life in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. c.</note> 
               <hi>all godlinesse, and honestie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All <hi>Iudges,</hi> and <hi>Courts of Iustice,</hi> euen this great <hi>Congregation,</hi> this great <hi>Councell,</hi> now ready to sit, receiue influence and

power from the King, and are dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of his <hi>Iustice,</hi> aswell as their owne, both in the Lawes they make, and in the Lawes they execute: in the Causes which they heare, and in the Sentences which they giue. The King, Gods High Steward, and they Stewards vnder him. And so long as <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Iudgement</hi> sits vpon all the Benches of a Kingdome, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is not possible for <hi>Fluxes</hi> and <hi>Meltings</hi> to begin in the State; or if they doe begin, their Drip will be cured pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.</p>
            <p>Now while the King keepes close to <hi>Ego judicabo, I will iudge</hi> that which comes to me <hi>according vnto right;</hi> if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour <hi>Iudges</hi> (which God forbid) iudge other then right, they sin against three at once, and against God in all, For first, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they sinne against the people, by doing them wrong in stead of <hi>Iustice.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they sinne against their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, not only by <hi>calling,</hi> but by <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing Good Exill,</hi> and <hi>Euill Good.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">Esay 5. 20.</note> they sin against the King, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>


               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:8785:11"/>
of <hi>Iustice</hi> vnder God, in slandering of his <hi>Iustice</hi> to the people, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration whereof they are trusted vnder him.</p>
            <p>And once againe for Inferiour Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of all sorts. The King is the Sunne. Hee drawes vp some vapours, some support, some supply from vs. T'is true: hee must doe so. For, if the Sun draw vp no vapours, it can powre downe no raine, and the <hi>Earth</hi> may bee too hard, as well as too soft and too <hi>melting.</hi> Now this Raine which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends, and is first caused by the Sunne, is prepared in the Clouds before it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth on the Earth. And all Great Men that are raised higher then the rest, especially Iudges and Magistrates of all sorts, they are the Clouds. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the more immediate influence from the King; and if they bee Gods <hi>Clouds,</hi> and retaine what hee gaue them, thev <hi>drop fatnesse</hi> vpon the people. But, <note place="margin">Psal. 65. 12.</note> if they bee <hi>clouds without water,</hi> they <note place="margin">Iudev. 12.</note> transmit no influence. If they bee <hi>light</hi>


               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:8785:12"/>

               <hi>by a whirlewind,</hi> then it is passionate, and violent influence. And the Clouds, I hope, are not, I am sure, should not bee thus, betweene the King, and his people.</p>
            <p>There is then <hi>Ego judicabo, I will iudge according vnto right,</hi> both for the King, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and all subordinate Magistrates vnder him.

            <p>For first, God comes in, when the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>Earth</hi> is <hi>melting</hi> by violence, and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. And then Gods <hi>Ego judicabo, I will iudge,</hi> is either in Mercy to repayre the breaches, to stay the <hi>melting</hi> of the State; or else in Iudgement to punish the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basers of <hi>Iustice.</hi> And this God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8785:12"/>
doth in this life. But if hee doe it not here, yet hee neuer failes to doe it at the last, and finall Iudgement; to which diuers of the <note n="*" place="margin">S. Basil. Hier. Aug. Euthym. Theod. <hi>Ibid.</hi> Greg. 10. <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi> 21. Bere. cp. 1.</note> Fathers referre this passage of my Text.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God comes in when the <hi>Seats</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> supreme and inferiour, are all entire. And then Gods <hi>Ego judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabo,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>I will iudge,</hi> is alwayes to confirme, and countenance the proceedings of <hi>Iustice,</hi> and to blesse the Instruments. And my Text hath it full. For it is not here said, I will iudge the causeonely, or the men onely whose cause it is, or the Iudges onely that sentence the cause; but <hi>Ego iustitias,</hi> I will iudge the very Iudgements themselues, how right, or otherwise they passe. And then this must needs be to confirme and honour them, if they bee iust; or to condemne and <hi>dissolue</hi> them, if they bee vniust, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they shall <hi>melt,</hi> or <hi>dissolue</hi> the State, or sometimes to send a <hi>melting</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that State in which Iustice is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:8785:13"/>
Now, howsoeuer men sometimes breake from their dutie in <hi>iudging accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to right,</hi> yet there can bee no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods proceedings. Hee will bee sure to <hi>iudge</hi> all things, and all men <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to right,</hi> who euer doe not. <hi>Shall</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 25.</note> 
               <hi>not the Iudge of all the world doe right?</hi> Yes, no question. And therefore euen Kings themselues, and all mightie men of the Earth, and Iudges of all sorts haue need to looke to then waies. For God is ouer them with <hi>Ego iudicabo,</hi> I will one day call for an accompt. I will iudge all the Executions of Iustice, with which I haue trusted them. And this is the first <hi>Preuention</hi> of the <hi>melting</hi> of a kingdome; the first <hi>Remedy</hi> when it begins to <hi>melt:</hi> The maintenance and Execution of Iustice.</p>
            <p>The second followes; and it is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>establishing</hi> of the <hi>Pillars</hi> of the <hi>Earth. I beare vp the Pillars of it. I,</hi> saith God, and <hi>I,</hi> saith the king.</p>
            <p>Where first, it is not amisse to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> what these great <hi>Pillars</hi> of the earth


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8785:13"/>
are. The Earth it selfe, that hath but one <hi>Pillar,</hi> and that is the <hi>poize,</hi> and <hi>aequilibre</hi> of the Center. And that is borne vp by the Word and Ordinance of God. <hi>Thou</hi>

            <p>The kingdomes of the Earth, they haue more <hi>Pillars</hi> then one. This one, which is Gods ordinance for gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they haue; but they haue diuers Administratours of this ordinance. And these <hi>Pillars</hi> are Kings, and Peeres, and Iudges, and Magistrates. Not one of these vnder the nature of a <hi>Pillar:</hi> not one; but yet with a great deale of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.

            <p>The Church, that is not without <hi>Pillars</hi> neither. No, God forbid. And it resembles in this the kingdomes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which it soiournes. The great

            <p>To the <hi>Pillars;</hi> and therefore they which weaken the gouernement; nay, which doe but offer to impaire the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation of the Gouernours, are dangerous and vnworthie members of any Common-wealth.

            <p>Continuall vse there is then of the <hi>Pillars.</hi> But what then? Can the <hi>Pillars</hi>

            <p>Now these of which we speake, are not stonie or insensible, but liuing and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> vnderstanding <hi>Pillars:</hi> vnderstanding, therefore they feele <hi>Onus terrae,</hi> the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Earth which lies vpon them,


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8785:16"/>
when the dull earth feeles not it selfe; therefore as they feele, so are they able to compare their strength, and the burden, and the difference of the burden at seuerall times; therefore while they compare they are sensible of the difference betweene supporting of earth, and <hi>Terrae liquefactae, dissolued,</hi> or <hi>dissoluing</hi> earth: For this latter is heauier a great deale; therefore in the difference they can tell where they are likeliest to shrinke vnder the burden, if God come not in to <hi>beare</hi> them <hi>vp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in all these cases, and many more, the <hi>Pillars</hi> of the earth must goe to God, as fast as the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the earth come to them. They must pray for themselues. And the Church, and the <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 2.</note> people must pray for them too. And the cloze of the prayers must still bee, that God would <hi>beare vp the Pillars,</hi> that they may be able to <hi>beare vp</hi> the earth.</p>
            <p>And for the honour of Kings and their great Assistants; marke it, God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> doth not say here, <hi>I beare vp</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi>

and the <hi>inhabitants</hi> of it, though he doth that too, and they cannot subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; but as if he had quite put them ouer to the King, and the great Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours vnder him, he saith, <hi>I beare vp the pillars;</hi> and then, I looke and will require of them, that they <hi>beare vp</hi> the State, and the people.</p>
            <p>Let mee speake a little boldly, (saith <hi>G. Nazianz.</hi>) Shew your selues gods to <note place="margin">Ocat. 27. n. 13.</note> your subiects; gods, and no lesse: Gods; why then you must doe Gods worke. And Gods worke euer since the Creation, is to preserue, and <hi>beare vp</hi> the world. Therefore as God <hi>beares vp</hi> you, so you must <hi>beare vp</hi> the Earth, and the people. God reteines his owne power ouer you; but hee hath giuen you his owne power ouer them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. His <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note> owne power, and that is to <hi>beare vp</hi> the people at home; and in all iust quarrels to force enemies abroad. And in all this t'is Gods power still, but yet he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise it by the <hi>Pillars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore in the first great leading of

his people, himselfe went before them in the forme of a <hi>pillar, Exod.</hi> 13.

And because this was an <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 24.</note> extraordinary <hi>pillar,</hi> and therefore can be no principle for ordinary conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, He makes <hi>Moses,</hi> which was the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>pillar,</hi> not <hi>beare</hi> onely, but strike too. He must stretch out his band vpon the Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 26.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now this great worke of God in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the <hi>pillars,</hi> kings and mighty Potentates of the Earth, is so manifest, that no reason can bee brought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it.</p>
            <p>First, in that the wisest, and mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> kings that euer were, haue beene in their seuerall times most religious.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in that euen those kings, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and great men vnderthem, which haue not accounted God their strength, haue yet thought it necessary to beare the world in hand, that they did rely vpon God to <hi>beare</hi> them <hi>vp.</hi> And this is a full


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8785:18"/>
proofe, that this principle is naturally printed in the heart of man, that God is <hi>Basis Columnarum,</hi> the foundation of the <hi>pillars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, in that very many times, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> weaker Gouernours both for wisedome and courage, doe prosper, and performe greater workes, then some, which in themselues had farre greater abilities, and a more prouident Councell about them. A famous instance of this, is Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> 2. To ascribe this to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune onely, worldly wisedome it selfe would condemne for folly. To giue it to Destinie, is to binde vp God in chaines vnworthy for men: For world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wisedome knowes this, that God in his workes <hi>ad extra,</hi> must be most free, or no God.

            <p>And certainly there's no true reason


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8785:18"/>
can be giuen of it, but this. First, <hi>Ego confirme,</hi> I establish and <hi>beare vp the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</hi> For so long the world cannot shake them. And secondly, <hi>Ego apto,</hi> I make fitte the <hi>Pillars,</hi> (as <hi>Tremel.</hi> reades it;) <note place="margin">Tremel. ibid.</note> for so long they <hi>beare,</hi> euen aboue their strength. And out of doubt, there is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much in the fitting of the <hi>Pillars.</hi> T'is not the great massinesse of a <hi>Pillar,</hi> but the cleane, and true working of him, that makes him beare; the fitting of him in time, and to his place.</p>
            <p>And here, as for many other, so espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for two things, wee haue great cause to blesse and magnifie God. First, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that since he would remoue our <hi>Royall Pillar,</hi> which had stood now vnder the weight of this Gouernment full 22. yeeres, yet he would not doe it, till he had prepared <hi>another,</hi> and brought him to full strength, to <hi>beare vp</hi> this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to Gods great honour, and his owne. Secondly, that by Gods great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> blessing, and his <hi>Royall Fathers</hi> prudent education, hee is, and was from the first


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8785:19"/>
houre, <hi>confirmata columna,</hi> an established, and a settled <hi>Pillar.</hi> And I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but <hi>aptata Columna</hi> too, A <hi>Pillar</hi> euery way <hi>fitted</hi> to the State he beares; <hi>fitted</hi> to the difficulties of the time; <hi>fitted</hi> to the State, and <hi>fitted</hi> to the Church.</p>
            <p>Now the Church, no question, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> the externall support of it, hath need, great need of Temporall <hi>Pillars</hi> too. At this time a great <hi>Pillar</hi> of this Church is falne; and doubtlesse a great part of the edifice had falne with it, if God had not made supply of another, and a very able <hi>Pillar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I finde <hi>Gen. 28.</hi> that there was an <note place="margin">Gea. 28. 18.</note>
               <hi>Anoynted Pillar;</hi> that it was anoynted by <hi>Iacob.</hi> The place was <hi>Bethel,</hi> the house of God. In it the Ladder of heauen, by which the Angels goe and come. But out of doubt this <hi>Pillar</hi> is here. This <hi>Pillar</hi> not yet anoynted by the hand of the Priest; but anoynted already to the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance and by the blessing of <hi>Iacob.</hi> The place where <hi>Iacob</hi> left him behind is the Church of God, and he left him a <hi>Pillar,</hi>


               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:8785:19"/>
for so hee rested on him, and well hee might. Old <hi>Iacob</hi> is gone by the Angels way to heauen, but he left the <hi>Pillar</hi> here behind at <hi>Bethel,</hi> for the house of God. And al the blessings of Heauen &amp; Earth bee vpon him all the dayes of his life.</p>
            <p>The Church in all times of her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensions, when schisme and faction haue made great Rents in her buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, hath still had recourse to her <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> to her Ciuill and his Ecclesiasticall <hi>Pillars;</hi> and shee goes right. For her <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> must support her, or shee cannot be borne vp.</p>
            <p>This very time is a time of Church diuision. What followes vpon it? what? why the Church is become <hi>Terra lique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facta,</hi> there's <hi>melting</hi> almost in euery part of it Christendome through, <hi>melting</hi> in all places, but not at the same <hi>Fire.</hi> For in one place Truth <hi>melts</hi> away from the doctrine of the Church. In another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion and good life <hi>melt</hi> away from the practise of the Church. In a third all externall meanes, and necessary sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8785:20"/>
               <hi>melts</hi> away from the maintenance of the Church. And but that I know <hi>Hell</hi> 
               <note place="margin">S. Matt. 16. 18.</note>
               <hi>gates cannot preuaile against it, it melts</hi> so fast sometimes, that I should thinke it is, as the world takes it, for a <hi>house of butter</hi> against the Sunne.</p>
            <p>Well, what's the cause that there should be such <hi>melting</hi> in the Church? what? why surely there are many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, would I complaine to you of them. But there are two in the very letter of my Text, and them I cannot bauk. But I speake of the Church in generall, and still hope the best of our owne.</p>
            <p>The One is, that the <hi>Ecclesiasticall Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which are the Churches most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <hi>bearers,</hi> are in many places of Christendome but <hi>hollow Pillars.</hi> And there's no trusting of <hi>hollow Pillars</hi> with such a weight as the Church is. And therfore here where God in mercy will stay the <hi>melting,</hi> t'is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>I will make the pillars solid.</hi> I will not leaue the Church any longer vpon hollow; hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall, and deceiptfull <hi>Pillars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:8785:20"/>
The Other is, that the Church oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> relyes too much vpon her <hi>Pillars,</hi> vpon the wisedome, and the power of them. And so farre, that sometimes <hi>Ego confirmani,</hi> God that <hi>heares vp the pillars</hi> is quite forgotten. And then whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shee and her <hi>Pillars</hi> leaue to rest vp on God, they fall on <hi>melting</hi> presently, and no wonder.</p>
            <p>But whatsoeuer the Churches Error be, this I am sure will concerne the State, and You. It is not possible in any Christian Commonwealth, that the Church should <hi>melt,</hi> and the State stand firme. For there can be no firmenes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law; and no Lawes can be binding if there be no conscience to obey them; penalty alone could neuer, can neuer do it. And no schoole can teach conscience but the Church of Christ. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you finde the Church <hi>melt</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue,</hi> there you shal see conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce decay. Therefore be <hi>Pillars</hi> to the Church, and you shalbe <hi>Pillars,</hi> strong <hi>Pillars</hi> to the State, and to your selues.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:8785:21"/>
The Third and last Circumstance of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Text is, The Time, that is chosen for both these, both for the execution of <hi>Iustice,</hi> and establishing the <hi>Pillars.</hi> And that is a set, and a <hi>conuenient time,</hi> euen <hi>when he shal receiue the Congregation.</hi> For that time I'le take, saith God, and I, saith the King.</p>
            <p>The first instant of this time set or taken is Opportunity. T'is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Text. And opportunity is the best mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all the extension of time. loose it, and loose all. The right vse of it is one of the things that differences wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from folly.</p>
            <p>Now a man would thinke that for these things in the Text, all times were times of opportunity. For can any time be vnfit to doe iustice, to <hi>iudge according to right,</hi> to <hi>beare vp the pillars</hi> of State and Church? no sure, there cannot. And yet, euen for these, here's both God and the King for opportunity. For here <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> promises both for God and himselfe, that he will take <hi>a conuenient time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:8785:21"/>
But then there is a great deale of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene God and the King in taking of it. For when the King comes to <hi>beare vp</hi> the State, t'is simply <hi>cùm ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepero tempus,</hi> when I shall take a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time. For no regall power hath any command ouer tim. It can neither force on, nor draw backe, nor make stay of opportunity. Hee must take it when God offers it, or not haue it. And if it be let slip, he cannot promise it shall returne to his hand againe. Nor can this great Court make an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to stay or reduce it.</p>
            <p>But when God comes to doe <hi>iustice</hi> and to <hi>beare</hi> vp the <hi>pillars</hi> themselues; then <hi>cùm accepero tempus</hi> is not simply the taking of a conuenient time, but the making of it too. And it stands not for <hi>eligere</hi> but <hi>statuere,</hi> not for a choyce of time, as if God must waite vpon it; but for appointing of time; and making it fit to serue both God and the King.</p>

               <hi>temporum</hi> (as <hi>Arnobius</hi> cals them) the pliantnes of time, will not attend, nor bee commanded by vs. So that here God's taking of the time is nothing but God's fitting of the time to vs, and vs to it. And when he is said to take it, it is for vs, not for himselfe.</p>
            <p>Now though God bee at this taking of the time, yet it is not in men to giue it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> him. No ability of man or any creature can doe that. And therefore where the speech is of God, it is absolute, and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Quum ego,</hi> when I shall take it. Not I and you, not I from you. But out of his owne wisedome he finds it, and out of his owne goodnes he takes it, and by his owne power he vses it, to <hi>beare vp the pillars of the Earth.</hi> And therefore here in the Text is neuer a <hi>Quum tu das,</hi> when thou giuest mee an opportunity,


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8785:22"/>
but when I take and order time by my selfe.</p>
            <p>And yet let me tell you, that where mans strength can doe nothing to giue God an opportunity to preserue the Earth, and the kingdomes of it from <hi>melting,</hi> there his weaknes can. For as weaknes is the thing that needs, so the time of <hi>melting</hi> is the opportunity of establishing the <hi>pillars</hi> of the earth. And so God in mercy is often pleased to make it. T'was so <hi>Psal. 9. The Lord will</hi>

When doth hee beare them? <hi>Quum terra lique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facta est,</hi> when States shake and seeme to be <hi>dissoluing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And since our sufficiency can giue Gods wisdome no opportunity; but yet our weaknes giues his mercy opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity enough; it is manifest, that no one

            <p>And now because God doth often <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> take vnto himselfe second meanes, and vses them in time, to watch ouer the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which himselfe giues, here's a touch in the Text for that too, when this fit time of bearing vp of the <hi>pillars</hi> of the Earth comes.

And beginning that seruice with Gods: For God forbid this Honourable Councell of State should sit downe and begin any where els then at God.</p>
            <p>Now the great <hi>Congregation</hi> among the Iewes was the <hi>Sanedrim.</hi> And the going vp of the Tribes to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was first <hi>to giue thanks vnto the Lord,</hi> and then <hi>to sit downe on the seate of iudgement. Psal.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 122. 4, 5. <hi>Ians.</hi> ibid.</note> 122. And <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at that time was the seat both of Religion and the State. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences I know there are many between vs and them, our gouernment &amp; theirs, but not in this, That the <hi>Tribes</hi> are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled and <hi>come vp</hi> to one place; Nor in this, That they come vp first <hi>to giue thankes</hi> to God, before they possesse the seate of <hi>iudgement;</hi> Nor in this much, that there is a <hi>Session,</hi> a <hi>Conuocation</hi> for Religion, aswell as <hi>Parliament</hi> for State. But to leaue them, and come to our owne.</p>
            <p>This great Councell of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, this <hi>Congregation</hi> is neuer <hi>receiued</hi> to meeting, but about the <hi>Pillars</hi> of the

State, the Lawes, and the Gouernement. That by the Lawes there might be <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to right;</hi> and by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement the <hi>Pillars</hi> may both <hi>beare</hi> and bee <hi>borne.</hi> I say <hi>beare,</hi> and be <hi>borne.</hi> For though in the text it be, <hi>I beare vp the Pillars.</hi> That is, I at al times; and I in some cases, where none can but I; and I when all forsake saue I; yet that is not so to be taken, as if the people were not bound to <hi>beare vp the Pillars,</hi> aswell as the <hi>Pillars</hi> them. No, for there's no question but they are bound, and strictly bound too, <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> And certaine it is no State can <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 6, 7.</note> flourish, if there be not mutuall support betweene the <hi>Earth</hi> and the <hi>Pillars:</hi> if it faile of either side, there's some <hi>melting</hi> or other presently.</p>

will be <hi>borne.</hi> And this is read in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Dictates of Nature for gouernement. For no man cuer saw a building of State, but the <hi>Pillars</hi> which <hi>beare vp</hi> it, are <hi>borne</hi> by the <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now God and the King doe both <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue</hi> this <hi>Congregation,</hi> and in fitnesse of time, and yet with a difference too. For the King <hi>receiues</hi> the <hi>Congregation</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, and a duise with it; but God <hi>receiues</hi> it, to direct, and to blesse it. And God with his blessing is neuer wanting to vs at these and the like times, if we bee not wanting to Him, and our selues.</p>
            <p>And thus you haue seene in what state the kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> was in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> time; and how easie it is for any kingdome to be in the like; in a <hi>melting,</hi> and a <hi>dissoluing</hi> estate. You haue likewise seene what <hi>Remedy</hi> was then, and what <hi>Preuention</hi> is now to bee thought of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this <hi>melting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This both <hi>Remedy,</hi> and <hi>Preuention</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists especially in impartial distribution of <hi>Iustice</hi> to the people; and in Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8785:25"/>
and powerfull supporting of the <hi>pillars</hi> of the State. The <hi>time</hi> for this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so fit, as <hi>when the Congregation is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued</hi> by the <hi>King</hi> to consultation, and by <hi>God</hi> to blessing.</p>
            <p>It is not much which I haue more to say. The <hi>Congregation</hi> is now ready to be <hi>receiued.</hi> The very <hi>Receiuing</hi> it ioynes it with the fitnesse of <hi>opportunity.</hi> For it is the <hi>Kings opportunity</hi> to blesse his people with <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Iudgement;</hi> and it is <hi>Gods opportunity</hi> to <hi>beare vp</hi> both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Peeres,</hi> both greater, and lesser <hi>pillars</hi> of the State. My text deliuers a promise of both. For'tis <hi>Dauids</hi> speech for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and for God. I'le doe both, saith God, and I, saith the King.</p>
            <p>Now you may not distrust this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise on either side; neither on <hi>Gods,</hi> nor <hi>Dauids.</hi> Not on <hi>Gods</hi> side. For that is Infidelity. Nor on the <hi>Kings.</hi> For what hath he done that can cause misbeliefe? or what hath hee not done, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his yeeres, that may not merit, and challenge beliefe of all?</p>

And for the comfort of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and all that dwell therein, the seruice of the day, which was first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for this businesse, seemes to mee to prophecie, that another <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> a wise, and a religious King hath begun his Reigne.

Let vs therefore end with Prayer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. That he would blesse both the King and the State.
