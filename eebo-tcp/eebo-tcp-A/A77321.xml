            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Cheſters Enlargement after three yeares bondage. Or, A Compendious Narration of the reducing of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Beſton</hi> Caſtle, with the memorable occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances conducing thereunto.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He City of <hi>Cheſter</hi> is a ſtrong Prize in it ſelfe, anciently ſuch by the high and broad Walls, with many Towers and Bulwarkes flankering the ſame, and ſince theſe troubles fortified by more than ordinary Mud-walls ſecuring the Suburbs: and to compleat the whole, the river <hi>Dee</hi> (in ſome meaſure Navigable) ſecures it on the Weſt and South, which ſwells ſo broad and high in the Tyde, that no forces by Land can reſtraine reliefe by Sea.</p>
            <p>The ſcituation likewiſe makes it moſt advantagious to the poſſeſſors, it being the key of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and a tye to unite North-<hi>Wales</hi> to <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> by a ſmall neck of land in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> five miles over, the Rivers on both ſides foardable.</p>
            <p>This Citie ever ſince the beginning of theſe troubles (Perfideouſly ſurprized by the Commiſſioners of Array, in time of Truce) was kept for the King, eſteemed the maſter-piece of theſe parts of the Kingdome, and in ſome meaſure accordingly lookt upon by the Parliament, whence it came to paſſe that much time and Treaſure was expended by the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Commander Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> for the reducing of it.</p>
            <p>More then two yeares agone it was firſt attempted, but the worke not well mannaged (the <hi>Militia</hi> being then in its infancie) it proved abortive. The enemy perceiving what they might expect in time, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured their utmoſt, by art and induſtrie to make it impregnable.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> perceiving that worke too difficult, betooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113465:10"/>
to another Deſigne, the reducing of <hi>Boſton</hi> Caſtle, a piece of ſuch annoyance and charge to the Country, that it will not bee impertinent to give a briefe account of the fortifying, loſing, and regaining of it, but the worke of this piece, and the City, did at all times ſo mutually interfare, that they muſt be twiſted in the hiſtorie.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of theſe Warres, and many yeares before, this piece was no more than the Skelliton, or bare Anatomy of a Caſtle, Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Brereton</hi> prizing it by the ſcituation, cauſed the Breaches to be made up with mud-walls, the Well of the outer Ward to be clenſed, and a few roomes erected, the old Walls being the greateſt part of the fabrick; a Captaine or two being wearied out of the charge of ſuch a Priſon, it was committed to Captaine <hi>Steele,</hi> (a rough-heawn man, no Souldier) whoſe care was more to ſee it repaired, victualled, and to live quietly there, than the ſafe cuſtody of it. After it was well ſtored with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Army out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the acceſſion of other Forces, under the command of Sir <hi>John Byron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> drew into <hi>Cheſhire: Steele</hi> had as ſufficient notice of his danger, as we of his negligence: the enemie ſuddenly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the inner Ward, where was nothing but ſtones, and a good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, he by his ſloath having loſt that part, out of cowardiſe gave up the other without delay: his reward was death, upon the ſentence of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Warre, ours, the loſſe of the Countrie, and the ſhaking of the whole County for the regaining of it, which the enemy kept in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, about the ſpace of two yeares.</p>
            <p>In <hi>December</hi> 1644. Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> with the Forces of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> and Auxiliaries of the Counties of <hi>Lancaſter, Yorke, Darby, Stafford, Warwicks,</hi> and <hi>Mountgomerie,</hi> a very conſiderable Armie, deſigned the reducing of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and this Caſtle, began to beleaguer the Caſtle by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying <hi>Beſton</hi> houſe, halfe a mile from it, and by ſome guards of Horſe and Foot in adjacent places. The enemy from <hi>Holt</hi> Caſtle falling upon our Quarters, cauſed us to quarter a ſtrong party in <hi>Farne,</hi> by which we reſtrained the incurſions from that Caſtle. Then the enemy from <hi>Cheſter</hi> fell upon our Quarters at <hi>Aldford<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which occaſioned us to bring the greateſt part of the Armie to ſtraiten <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in the moneth of <hi>February Chriſtleton</hi> being the head quarter (about a mile from <hi>Chester)</hi> was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from Horſe by ſleight mud-walls, by this meanes the City was ſtraitned on this ſide the River: At this time (holding correſpondence with ſome in the towne) we attempted a ſurpriſall, but (for ought we can learne) were drawne on by a ſubtill wile of the enemy, yet brought off without loſſe by divine providence.</p>

One memorable atcheivement fell out in thetime of this Leaguer; the enemy from <hi>Cheſter</hi> with a body of fifteen hundred Horſe and Foote, endeavoured the ſurpriſall of <hi>Chriſtleton,</hi> whiles they were at dinner, after notice of their approach by the centry on the ſteeple, in a quarter of an houres ſpace, Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> drew up the Horſe, and adjutant <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiane</hi> ſeven hundred Foote, the enemy layd a ſtrong Ambuſcado of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three hundred Foote in the hedges, the Body of their Horſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards their Foote in a faire broade Lane nere <hi>Boughton,</hi> Collonel <hi>Iones</hi> with his owne Troop, and Major <hi>Sankey</hi> with his, charged through their Ambuſcado, which ſo terrified the Enemy that many of them caſt downe their Armes, then they routed their Horſe, againſt whom the City ſhut their Gates, leaſt by their retreat they ſhould looſe all their Foote, Adjutant <hi>Louthian</hi> divided his foote, and drew them into the feildes to fall on the Enemies foote on both ſides the lane, whom he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly routed, chaſing them within Musket ſhot of their own Workes. Our Horſe being but few not ſeconded by the Reſerve, the Enemies Horſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and compelled by the Citizens to face about, we were neceſſitated to drive away what priſoners we could with ſafety, and whom we could not bring off we cut and ſlaſht miſerably, which cauſed many to ſupplicate themſelves priſoners, that they might eſcape wounds, many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped from us down a ſteep Hill by the river, others got into boggy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

            <p>On Eaſter Eave we blockt up the City on the Welch ſide alſo, for the ſpace of ſixe weckes, adjutant <hi>Louthiane,</hi> who quartered in <hi>Hawarden</hi> blockt up the Caſtle, drewe his Trenches within a ſtones caſt of it, and ſo farre advance the worke by undermining and battery, that in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a few dayes had ſet us in poſſeſſion of it, others quartered in all the Townes and Houſes neerer <hi>Cheſter,</hi> to the repreſſing of markets, but not reſtraining of reliefe, for both ſides were in ſome meaſure open to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and ſome proviſion, ſpecially the Cheſhire ſide. Our hopes of ſucceſſe were great, but the time of mercy for ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> high a favour was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113465:11"/>
yet come; Our eyes were ſo fixt on the vaſt body of an army, being the creame and gallantry of all the adjacent Counties, that God would not eclypſe his owne glory, leſt it ſhould be ſaid man had done it. For upon the approach of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> with a farre leſſe force, we quit that ſide of the river, leaving the City open to <hi>Wales,</hi> and upon Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> advance towards him, with acceſſion of Force, we quit both the Leaguers, and having ſtrengthned the Garriſons, drew to the further ſide of Cheſhire, remoteſt from danger.</p>
            <p>This proved fatall to the Country, for the enemy at <hi>Holte</hi> burnt <hi>Faune, Cheſter</hi> burnt <hi>Chriſtleton,</hi> haveing before upon our approach burnt great <hi>Boughton,</hi> they of <hi>Beſton</hi> Caſtle burnt <hi>Beſton</hi> hall, and <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> houſe, two goodly manſions, and required ſeventeene weekes arrears of the Country (which was payd) according to the time we had blockt up the Caſtle, in which time we loſt much blood, both in <hi>Wales</hi> and at <hi>Beſton,</hi> ſpent much Treaſure, and almoſt waſted the Country on both ſides the river.</p>
            <p>The enemy encouraged hereby iſſued out of <hi>Cheſter</hi> with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foote and one hundred and twenty horſe (the deſigne not yet knowne to us) paſſed nere <hi>Tarvin,</hi> ſo through <hi>Barrow,</hi> and accidentally fell upon Captain <hi>Gleggs</hi> quarters at <hi>Helſeby,</hi> tooke him, all his Troope, and ſome Country men priſoners, marcht towards <hi>Beſton,</hi> intending to paſſe home by <hi>Holte:</hi> Upon intelligence, <hi>Tarvin</hi> ſent out, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Livetenant Collonel <hi>Venables</hi> two hundred horſe (moſt of which by ſpeciall providence hapned to be there at that time) and one hundred and ninty Foote, theſe haſted towards the enemy, whom they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in <hi>Eaton</hi> towne, reſcued Captain <hi>Glegg,</hi> all his men, the Country men, and ſome of his Horſe, ſlew ſeven, many eſcaped by counterfeting themſelves dead, tooke three Captains, many Officers two hundred and twenty Souldiers, and all their plunder, loſt not a man on the ground, but foure dyed of their wounds not long after.</p>
            <p>After this Sir <hi>William Brereton,</hi> by an Ordinance, was called up to the Parliament; the tranſaction of the Civill affaires of the County, were committed to ſeaven Truſtees, and the Deputy Lievtenants, the Military to Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> and adjut. <hi>Louthiane,</hi> men of ſuch knowne worth, that they need no Character of honour from this penne.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Souldiers layd the foundation to the worke according to their owne principles. Firſt they endeavoured to appeaſe the Souldiers who were deſperately mutinous, and the Horſe on their march to leave
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113465:11"/>
the County for want of pay, and becauſe of their deep arreares, this the Gentlemen performed by faire language, a months pay in hand (bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed and out of their owne purſes) and by deep engagements for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant monthly pay, then they put in execution the new Moddle, by which the ſouldiers were reduced to ſuch order that they paſt muſter every night upon the Parade, and all that came not dayly upon duty loſt their pay. The Country were as ſenſible of their owne happineſſe, that they payd to none, but thoſe that ſerved, and that all free quarter to the Foote was taken off.</p>
            <p>Their firſt ſervice was for Leiceſterſhire, Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> went out with five hundred Horſe and Dragoones, adjutant <hi>Louthiane</hi> with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable body of Foote, as farre as <hi>Bakewell,</hi> the Horſe were Commanded to <hi>Darby</hi> to joyne with Sir <hi>John Gell,</hi> who ſo retarded the Forces under his Command that they came ſhort of the Battle at <hi>Nasby,</hi> to which ſervice they were deſigned, yet advancing afterwards to <hi>Leceſter,</hi> were very ſerviceable for the reducing of that Towne, till the worke was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>The firſt deſigne upon their returne, was the ſiege of <hi>Beſton</hi> Caſtle, by their owne Forces onely: to make the worke ſure (which formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved abortive) they erected a ſtrong Fort within musket ſhot of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, before the Gate, finiſht it in ſeaven dayes, built a convenient houſe in it, which they ſtoard with proviſion and ammunition, afterwards made a Counterskerfe, hereby all hope of releiſe to the Caſtle was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut off, and they enabled to draw off the greateſt part of their Force, when called thereto, by an invading enemy (which fell out twice) or for the carrying on of any deſigne, by which meanes unexpectedly they ſurpriſed the Suburbes of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> God ſo farre ſmyl'd upon this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, that in all the dangerous worke of the Fort, we loſt not a man, nor a drop of Blood, though perpetually a faire marke to a violent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
            <p>This worke ſo farre advancr, their thoughts were upon <hi>Cheſter,</hi> though it ſeem'd a deſigne almoſt impoſſible in the judgement of man, for all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible meanes was gone, the Commander in cheif to the Parliament all the Auxiliaries diſperſt to their owne Countries, and we a ſmall deſpiſed in conſiderable Force, not onely engaged in the Leaguer of <hi>Beſton,</hi> but hard put to it by the incurſions of <hi>Holte</hi> Caſtle (a bad neighbour) beſides other Forces out of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cheſter,</hi> daily infeſting ſome part of the County, but laying to heart the reproach caſt on us by ſome of our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113465:12"/>
pretended friends, as if all our worke were to lye idle in the Leaguer, and conſidering it was all one with God to worke with many or few, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſtorme the Citie.</p>
            <p>But whiles we were intent upon this, two rubbs fell in the way, the King with ſome force drew towards <hi>Namptwich</hi> intending for the North, which cauſed us to draw off the Foot, to ſecure the Garriſons from ſurprizall, and Collonell <hi>Iones</hi> with the Horſe, and a ſmall party of Foot undertooke the charge of <hi>Beſton.</hi> The King drawing off from thoſe parts inclined his courſe doubtfully, whether for <hi>Darby,</hi> or the lower parts of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> intending to fall into the North, and ſo to joyne with <hi>Mountreſſe,</hi> which counterchanged our courſe, for <hi>Adjutant Louthiane</hi> with the Foot, and a ſmall partie of Horſe undertooke the Leaguer of <hi>Beſton,</hi> Collonel <hi>Iones</hi> with foure hundred Horſe and Dragoones went into the field, to ſave the Countrie (in the lower parts of <hi>Cheſhire)</hi> from ſpoile, to fall upon the reare of the enemy, and to fight if occaſion ſhould require, having an acceſſion of foot in the skirts of the Countie. In this expedition he was drawne by authoritie to a longer march than was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, expecting to be engaged towards <hi>Doncaſter</hi> or <hi>Newarke,</hi> where the Scots and the adjacent Countries made up a very puiſſant Army. Upon his returne preparation was againe made for the intended enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize upon the City, but was retarded a few weekes by want of pay for the Armie, and by the intelligence of the King drawing this way (being taken off his expedition for the North) which made us ſtand on our guard, that we might not loſe the ground we had gained at <hi>Beſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That cloude diſpelled, they fixt upon a day for this ſo great a worke, and that it might be done without noiſe, they made uſe only of their owne ſtrength, being about five hundred Horſe, two hundred Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goones, and ſeaven hundred Foot, and they that were privie to the deſigne tooke an oath of ſecreſie.</p>
            <p>On Friday <hi>September</hi> 19. we drew off the Leaguer at <hi>Beſton</hi> towards <hi>Cheſter,</hi> but out of the common rode, that we might make no noiſe in the Countrey, nor the beleaguer'd Caſtle give any ſignall of forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: after a tedious march all night, wee ſtorm'd the Suburbs of the Citie by breake of day, were not diſcovered till we attempted the Work, the Sentinell ſhot at our men, askt if we had brought our deare brethren (meaning the Scots) with us, to take the Citie: Wee multiplyed not words, but fell to the worke, Captaine <hi>Gymbert</hi> was the firſt that entred, his Ladder being to ſhort, he lift up his man to the mount (neere the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113465:12"/>
ſide) from the top of it, his man drew him up by the hand, and then they cryde, a towne, a towne, immediately they cleared that Mount, ſlew Lievtenant <hi>Alderſey,</hi> the Captain e of the Watch, and put the reſt, about ſix men to flight, then others ſet too their Ladders, poſſeſt themſelves of all the Mounts on that ſide the Citie, and with the inſtruments wee brought with us, brake open the gates: then all the Horſe entred, with the remainder of the Foot, with loude ſhouts, which utterly daunted the enemie. The next worke was to take the Barrs, being the Fortification for the Forreſt ſtreet, which was effected ſpeedily, by entring at the back of ſome houſes, not farre from the gate, ſo we fell upon that guard in the reere, who fled in all haſt into the City, that while our men opened the gate into the Forreſt ſtreet, which we entred with a full body of Horſe and Foot, and ſome ſo cloſe perſu'd the Guard, that they were neere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the City with them. Maſter Major very difficultly got into the City, but made ſuch haſte, that he left the Sword and Mace at his houſe in the Suburbs.</p>
            <p>Thus poſſeſt of the out-workes, we ſet guards in all places, where the enemie might fall in upon us, poſted Letters to the Gent. over all the County, alſo to <hi>Lancaſhire, Salop,</hi> and <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> ſignifying what God had done for us, deſiring their aſſiſtance to the perfecting of this worke, who neglecting all other engagements, haſted towards us, as if the worke had been their owne.</p>
            <p>The enemies firſt worke was to fire the Suburbs, by their inſtruments lurking amongſt us, ſome of which we ſlew, they burnt Cow-lane, and St. <hi>Iohns</hi> lane: after that they burnt up all the ſtreet without the North gate, to deprive us of all quarter, though many hundred Families of their partie, and much proviſion were deſtroyed thereby.</p>
            <p>The next day after the ſtorme, we brought in the Artillerie, prepared a batterie that night, fell upon the worke the next day, made a wide breach by the New gate, intending to ſtorme the City at night: before which Maſter Major was writ to, by way of adviſe to prepare the City to a ſummons (which was peremptorie) for the ſurrender of it, the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons they would not reade, becauſe the forme in the direction pleaſed them not, the anſwer returned by the Major, was to his wife in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs, that ſhe might comfort her heart, for the King was within foure miles for their reliefe. About ſeven a clocke that night, we ſtormed the towne in three or foure places, ſome fought valiantly upon the tops of their Ladders, many of which proved too ſhort: Captaine <hi>Finch</hi> with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113465:13"/>
his Fire-locks entred the breach, beat off the enemie, but he, his Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſome others being wounded and carried off, they who were to ſecond them were diſcouraged: ſo the worke was ſuſpended for that time.</p>
            <p>The City, apprehenſive of their owne danger, in that we followed the worke ſo cloſe, ſent to the King, who gave them aſſurance of reliefe, drawing towards them with all ſpeed, which cauſed us to ſend out ſome to ſeeke out Generall Pointz, and to haſten him to our reliefe, which was ſeaſonably effected, for he quartering at <hi>Whitchurch</hi> on Tueſday night, marched thence before midnight: about ſix a clocke next morning, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd wirhin three miles of <hi>Chester,</hi> neere the Kings Armie, before they knew of one another. <hi>Poyntz</hi> was upon <hi>Hatton</hi> Heath, divided from the Enemy by a ſhort Lane, whom he charged with a Forlorne hope, was very active in his owne perſon, and many gallant Gentlemen with him, but being overpowred by the body of the Enemy, who were in a good poſture upon the open field, they put him to a retreat, though their loſſe was judged neere as great as his, but the wounding of Collonel <hi>Greaves,</hi> Collonel <hi>Bethel,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Cotton,</hi> gallant men, wrought no ſmall diſtraction amongſt them: both Armies continuing facing one another after the skirmiſh (a lane betwixt them) till about foure a clocke; by which time Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> was ſent from the Suburbs of <hi>Cheſter</hi> with five hundred Horſe, and as many Foot, commanded by Collonel <hi>John Boothe</hi> to the reliefe of <hi>Poyntz:</hi> the enemie in <hi>Cheſter</hi> perceiving that, ſent about one thouſand horſe and foot upon the reere of Collonell <hi>Iones,</hi> yet by two hundred Horſe, and as many Foot, ſent out of the Suburbs by Adjut. <hi>Louthaine,</hi> thoſe were repelled and driven another way, ſo Collonel <hi>Iones</hi> arrived ſafe to the field.</p>
            <p>The Enemie in <hi>Cheſter</hi> perceiving ſo many gone out of the Suburbs, tooke the opportunitie to aſſault the Workes, endevouring to caſt out ſuch unwelcome neighbours, this they attempted in divers places, but were valiantly repulſed by Adjutant <hi>Louthaine,</hi> this was the ſecond worke of that day, wherein God appeared for us, making theſe the firſt fruits of a glorious enſuing victory.</p>
            <p>When the Enemie perceived Generall <hi>Poyntz,</hi> and the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Forces about to joyne, they quit their ground, drew into a body, and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Batalia upon <hi>Rowton</hi> Moore, we mattialled our ſelves likewiſe and joyned Battell betweene foure and five a clocke, the greateſt burden lay upon the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Horſe, becauſe they were freſh for ſervice, the reſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113465:13"/>
much wearied with an inceſſant march and long faſting; Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> encouraged his ſouldiers with ſuch language, that he drew teares from their eyes, and vowes from their mouths, that they would ſticke faſt to him, whether in life or death, which they faithfully performed: the reſt alſo buckled themſelves to the ſervice in hand, and to give both ſides their due, they performed the worke with as much valour and reſolution as could be expected from men: But God owning his owne cauſe, made the Parliament partie victorious, who ſlew them with a great ſlaughter on the ground, and chaſed them over all the Countrie.</p>
            <p>Some of their ſcattred party united themſelves neere <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and made head againe; theſe were compoſed of thoſe, who following Collonel <hi>Iones</hi> in the reere, were driven toward bridge <hi>Trafford,</hi> and the eſcaped in the field, who were partly twiſted in the Parliaments Armie, whiles they purſued the victory, and part of them driven before us: opportunity ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, they ſeparated themſelves, drew into a body, fell upon our purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army, who ſuſpected no danger, got ground of us, and put us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate, but more force comming up, we drave them under the Walls of the Suburbs, where the guards from the Walls made execution on them. The reverſion of theſe, and the reſt, were gleaned up over all the Countie, and in divers other Countries where they were ſcattered, ſo that God made it the moſt cleare and full victory of any Battell yet fought in the Kingdome, for we ſlew about three hundred men on the ground, many were drowned, attempting to ſwim the river, we tooke above 1000. pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, beſides what daily were gleaned up by countrie men and women, yea, by knowne Cavaliers. We tooke moſt of the Horſe, to the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhing of the County, and our Troopes: amongſt other conſiderable men, the Earle of <hi>Litchfield</hi> was ſlaine. Wee loſt not 30. men on the ground, the chiefeſt of thoſe, Captaine <hi>Culme</hi> and Capt. <hi>Crant,</hi> and ſome few died of their wounds afterwards, the chiefe of them were, Collonel <hi>Prince,</hi> and Captain <hi>Cotton,</hi> men much lamented.</p>
            <p>After this, neceſſitie required ſome refreſhing for Generall <hi>Poynts</hi> his Army, he intended his quarters neere to the City that night, and the next day to compaſſe it on the other ſide the river, not only to diſtreſſe the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but to encompaſſe the King in it, or purſue his leane reverſion, if eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thence.

            <p>To haſten the worke of reducing the City, we ſent a Convoy for the great Guns at <hi>Stafford</hi> and <hi>Salop,</hi> by them to force a ſpeedy entrie, before the King could reinforce himſelfe to returne, Powder and Ball was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether wanting for ſo great a ſervice, but the Gentlemen of the County were ſo forward for the worke, that they engaged themſelves for foure hundred pounds, by which we were furniſhed with Ammunition from <hi>Warrington:</hi> but ſuch jugling there was to prevent the ball, and retard the Guns, and by ſubtill agents, that cannot endure the work ſhould proſper in the hands of theſe inſtruments (who affect the cauſe, as they fancie the Leader) that we loſt above a weeke for the effecting of this great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne. Upon Munday <hi>Octob.</hi> 5. the City was ſo ſtrictly begirt on both ſides the River, that none could paſſe in or out for the guards, of which Sir <hi>Iohn Byron</hi> the Governour complained in his Letters to the Archbiſh. of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and his brother, ſent to them at <hi>Conway,</hi> but intercepted by us that day, the Powder and Ball being come, we fixt a batterie on Tueſday night, on the Northſide towards the River, and made a breaſt-worke for Muskettiers on the Welch ſide, which clear'd a good part of the wall on the inſide. On Wedneſday we battered the Bulwarke next the North gate, even with the Wall; On Thurſday the wall it ſelfe, cloſe by the Goblen Tower, which proved ſo thicke, and the Ball ſo brittle, that not much more than the battlements was beaten downe: whiles the beſieged endeavoured to make up the breach by packs, feather-beds, &amp;c. and to lyne the Wall all along; Our Cannon on the Welch ſide made great execution, ſwords, armes, leggs, whole bodies were ſeene to flye in the

ayte, cart loads of bodies drawne off, and the Horſe in the reare driving up men and women to make up the breach. That night, a little before Sun-ſett we ſtorm'd the City upon the new breach, the old breach neere the new gate, and by ſcaling betwixt the Eaſt gate, and the Fenix tower: the ſtorme was very hot for neere two houres together, ſome of ours carried it very ſtoutly, fighting in the breach, and on the tops of the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, had they been ſutably ſeconded, the Town in all probability had been ours that night: In concluſion, we made good our retreate in the darke: we loſt 27 men on the ground, of thoſe, no Officers, but a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant and a Corporall, about 60. wounded, amongſt them Lievtenant-Collonell <hi>Venables,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Maſſy,</hi> brother to the renowned <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi> of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> but neither of them dangerouſly: the report from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City is, that their loſſe was more than ours, amongſt others, Sir <hi>William Manwaring</hi> was ſlaine, an unlucky Knight, to fall the firſt time he came into the field, and a wall betwixt him and danger.</p>
            <p>Upon Saturday <hi>Octob.</hi> 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the bridge of Boats (a very vſefull piece, uniting the Forces on both ſides the River) was finiſhed: the one end fixt within the Workes, the other guarded with a Fort, whence the line was intended to intrench the Citie on the Welch ſide, to prevent all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe. The Munday after, we had a deſigne upon <hi>Holt,</hi> in regard of the Enemie drawne thither, reported to be 700. which indangered the reliefe of <hi>Beſton,</hi> and the beating up of our quarters. Thereupon Collonel <hi>Iones</hi> fellſuddenly upon <hi>Holt,</hi> with above 1000. horſe and foot, who fell ſo unexpected on the Enemie, that had the Forlorne hope obſerved the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to keep within Musket ſhot of the Body, in all probabilitie, wee had entred the Caſtle, before they had drawne up the Bridges; There we had a ſharpe skirmiſh with about 140 horſe, and the Caſtle foot, (for that was all the ſtrength that Fame had made 700.) upon whom we fell with ſuch violence, that we beat them into the Caſtle ditch, made great execution on them in the fall, ſlew one Major, and many other ſouldiers, wounded very many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> took Lievtenant Coll. <hi>Byron,</hi> the Lord <hi>Byrons</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, five more, and ſome good horſes: our loſſe was two men ſlain three wounded, not mortally, others ſleightly wounded: fourteene of our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne hope taken, whoſe neglect of commands rendred them priſoners. By this atchievement, we quite brake that Body, ſecured the Leaguer at <hi>Beſton,</hi> and our own quarters.</p>
            <p>Neere about that time Major <hi>Sankey</hi> with a party of horſe fell upon <hi>Hawarden</hi> towne, which would not contribute to the Leaguer, layd an

            <p>Upon Friday, and ſome dayes after our Cannon played on the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies mills, ſpoyled 3. of them, and battered the water Tower, by which water was conveighed into the whole City. At this time we had ſure intelligence of the enemies advance towards us, whereupon the Commanders ſpeeded Letters to all the adjacent parts to haſten all the releife poſſible, that we might be enabled to make good the Leaguer, and give Battle to the enemy in the field, that ſo we might looſe no ground.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the military affaires of this County were under the charge of Col. <hi>Iones</hi> &amp; adju. <hi>Louthiane,</hi> who diſcharged that truſt in al their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, with as much prudence, reſolution and gallantry, as could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed from men, whoſe endevours God ſtill crowned with happy ſucceſſe, and the worke in their hands ſo farre advanc'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon Saturday <hi>October</hi> the twenty five Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> came to <hi>Namptwich,</hi> appointed by the Parliament to Command in cheife, to whom the Commanders from the Leaguer ſignifyed the enemies deſigne, and the preparation already made to entertaine them. Sir <hi>William</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of that courſe, ſeconded their Letters, to draw in the Auxiliaries, who were very forward of themſelves to promote this great deſigne, in which they were all ſo much concerned.</p>
            <p>By this time the enemy in <hi>Wales</hi> were reported to be potent, to the great encouragement of the beleaguerd City and Caſtle. Sir <hi>William Brereton,</hi> however ſummon'd the Caſtle hopeing their low condition might incline them to a Parlie, but they being confident of help at hand, by ſignalls from the City, and adjacent Caſtles, ſent backe the Drumme in a moſt ſcornfull and reproachfull manner. Then Sir <hi>William</hi> ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> with fourteene hundred Horſe and Dragoones, and adjutant <hi>Louthiane</hi> with one thouſand Foote, to ſeeke and diſſipute the

enemy reported to be about three thouſand at <hi>Denbigh. October</hi> the twenty nine we marc't to <hi>Moulde,</hi> the next day to <hi>Ruthen,</hi> and <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the firſt to <hi>Denbigh,</hi> where the enemy being about one and twenty hundred Pedees making up the number ſtayd for us, not knowing we were ſo many, we intended for <hi>Denbigh</hi> greene, a faire peice of ground for a Battle, they intercepted our courſe, at a place called <hi>Whitechurch,</hi> a mile from <hi>Denbigh,</hi> where our Forlorne hope was engaged, and fought couragiouſly, till the Body came up, after which, though we got ground, yet could not the Horſe paſſe through that ſtrait lane, before which the enemy was marſhald in a body, therefore a competent part being left to keepe that ground, the reſt marcht in a compaſſe nere foure miles, to forme the Batalia upon <hi>Denbigh</hi> greene, or if the enemy would not there fight, to compaſſe them on both ſides, which they perceiving, fell upon the party left to keepe that paſſe, ours beate them off and got into open ground which caus'd them to flye to the Caſtle hill for ſhelter, there they ralli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and came downe againe, our Foote with the <hi>Warwicke</hi> and <hi>Darby</hi> Horſe diſperſt them againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> drave them from under the Walls of the Caſtle, and put them to a totall rout, whom the Horſe purſued 8. miles, till the night forct them home, it is conjectured that we ſlew about 100. on the ground tooke above 300. many of which we loſt in haſte to get ſeaſonably to the campe, and becauſe we ſaw they were not worth the keeping. Sir <hi>William Vaughan</hi> their Commander eſcapt by a timely flight, advertiſing the Towneſmen to provide for themſelves, who thereupon tooke Sanctuary in the Caſtle, burnt a great part of the Towne, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the fireing of the whole, we tooke above 800. Horſe, loſt not a man on the field, or but one, and not 20 wounded.</p>
            <p>The Munday after this bleſſed atcheivement, we returned to the Leaguer at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> about 30. advancing, before the army came up in ſight of the City, and wandring upon a vexatious mariſh ground, gave occaſion to the enemy to thinke we were routed, whereupon, after a great ſhout given in the City, all the Horſe and ſome Foote ſallied out upon our quarters next the Bridge, which cauſed a very ſharpe Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mige of long continuance, in concluſion, we drave them in with ſome loſſe on our ſide, which warnd us, not to be ſecure upon a victory, nor to neglect our guards. The maine buſineſſe of the Leaguer thenceforth was, to finiſh the Trenches on the Welchſide the City, that went ſlowly on for want of mony, which occaſioned the enemy out of the Towne to take their advantages to fall upon our Guards, which put us to almoſt daily Skirmiſhing, and ſome loſſe.</p>

Upon Friday <hi>November</hi> 14. after 18. weekes Seige the beleagured Caſtle of <hi>Beſton</hi> was brought to ſuch extremities for want of proviſion, that their ſtout hearts came downe to beate a Parly, Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> appointed Collonel <hi>Croxton</hi> the Governour of <hi>Namptwich</hi> to Treate with them, who tooke to his aſſiſtance Livetenant Collonel <hi>Coote,</hi> they delivered up the Caſtle the next Lords day upon theſe conditions: To march out every man armed, Colors flying, Drummes beating, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches light, a proportion of powder and ball, all their proper goods to be carryed with them, which laded two waines, a Convoy to guard them to <hi>Flint</hi> Caſtle, as many as pleaſed to live quietly at their owne homes, and ſo farre truſted, that no hoſtage was left to ſecure the returne of the Convoy, they were brought ſo low that they had eaten their catts, and had not proviſion for that night, High conditions for a moſt bloody, inſolent Country-waſteing enemy, and them brought to ſuch a ſtarved condition. Their march being on the Sabbath, occaſioned the breach of that holy reſt to many in the Country, who attended their firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to enquire after their plundered goods, ſtoard up in that Cage of violence, and denne of theives.</p>
            <p>The next Wedneſday after Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> ſummoned the City in hope that their wants within, and loſſe of <hi>Beſton,</hi> might incline them to a Parly, after full deliberation on the ſummons, they returned an high ſcornefull, and contempteous anſwer, playing upon, and jeering at the moſt perſwaſive a rguments uſed for the ſurrender of the City: that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no better effect, he ſent to them once more by their owne Trumpet, that ſince they deſpiſed ſuch favour tendred, their blood muſt reſt on their owne heads.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday night <hi>November</hi> 9. about midnight, the enemy in the City had a great deſigne to fire our bridge of boates, and to cut off the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer guards on the Welch-ſide to the effecting thereof, they ſent 2. Boats carryed downe with the Tyde, laden with Tallow, Pitch, and other combuſtible mater, with a frame of wood on the top of them, on which were fixt double charged Carbines, and other ſhorter peeces, to make execution on them that ſought to quench the fire; the one of theſe fired hard by the Bridge they intended to burne, made no execution on it, or on any perſon, but was ſeaſed on by our men, and the fire quencht, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fired in the mid way, betwixt their Bridge and ours, conſumed it ſelf, without hurt to any. To put us to the greater diſtraction, they ſallyed out Horſe and Foote at the ſame time upon the Guards nere the Bridge,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113465:16"/>
and they of <hi>Holt</hi> Caſtle alarum'd our quarters at <hi>Pulford,</hi> thinking thereby to worke ſuch diſtraction, that one Guard might not relieve an other, if their deſigne ſhould take, but this attempt proved deſtructive to themſelves, for after an hot diſpute, we beate them in, wounded many, ſlew 12. by the confeſſion of their owne party, which put them to great diſtractions within the City, when that which promiſed releife, proved their loſſe. In all that ſervice we loſt not a man, nor a drop of blood that we know of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> 4. a great packet of Letters was intercepted by our guards, ſent out of the City by a fit agent, ſignifying to their owne party their low condition with deſire of releife. The maine buſineſſe was lockt up in Characters, and they had the key, the report of their condition was referred to the Meſſenger, who choſe rather to runne all hazards, than confeſſe and diſcover his Meſſage. Being ſent priſoner for <hi>Tarvin</hi> behind one of our men, he tooke the opportunity to diſmount himſelfe on the new bridge, leapt into the water, in hope to eſcape into the City by ſwym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſunke in the mid way, and was drowned; whom, though he eſcaped Martiall juſtice, vengeance would not ſuffer to live.</p>
            <p>Now came in the happy tydings of the ſurrender of <hi>Latham,</hi> upon very honourable conditions, to Collonel <hi>Iohn Booth,</hi> who thereupon tendred the further aſſiſtance of Lancaſhire, for the ſervice of this Leaguer, which tender was as opportune, as curteous, for this peice being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, the enemy commanded by Sir <hi>William Vaughan</hi> drew into a poſture nere <hi>Bridgenorth</hi> for the releife of it: they advanc't into Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire with about 2000. Horſe and Foote, fell upon <hi>Rockadine</hi> Church, where the Parliament had a ſmall Garriſon, which beate them off with loſſe, this cauſed Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> to prepare ſeaſonably to breake that deſigne, to the carryng on of which, Lancaſhire ſupplyed us with 13. Troopes, and 300. Foote. Upon the Sabbath day <hi>December</hi> 21. we drew off all we could ſpare from the Leaguer, and marcht that day to <hi>Whitchurch</hi> the army joyn'd was about 1500. Horſe and 1500. Foote, there we ſtayd till Friday, which was a little reſpiration to this waſted County, and ſo farre wrought upon the enemy, that we heard no more of them, then a retreat towards <hi>Kiddermuſter.</hi> In that time the enemy iſſued out of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and made an eſcape with 18. Horſe, and the Lord Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the way was open for their paſſage, becauſe no Trenches were cut on the Welch-ſide to interrupt them in their march, yet the Guard tooke Livetenant Collonel <hi>Needeham,</hi> and 3. more.

Friday, Dec. 26. the violence of the Spring tide was ſuch, that carrying up a great waight of Ice, it brake the new Bridge made of Boats; the beleagured were much incouraged hereby, made uſe of the preſent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for ſome relief, before we could repair that broken piece. On Saturday night the Enemy in <hi>Wales</hi> with about 150 horſe of the L. <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> and others joyned with his, marcht beſide our guards into the City, with ſome ſmall relief of Wheat, Oatmeal, Pyes, and Moneys for the Welch Souldiers, which was collected for them towards Conway. The next morning, with the aſſiſtance of Cheſter horſe, and about 600 foot, they forced their paſſage through the guards to Hawarden caſtle, with the loſſe of a Cornet, a Corporal, and one common Souldier taken by the guard.</p>
            <p>Col: <hi>Iones</hi> perceiving the danger might enſue to the Leaguer on the Welch ſide by this unhappy accident of the Bridge broken, haſted that day over the Foard with 600 horſe, 100 Dragoons, and appointed 100 foot to march after him, to diſſipate that party, which was preparing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief for the City, and to eaſe theſe oppreſſed parts of the burthen of free quarter; that night we quartered at Mould, then coaſted about the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey neer <hi>Ridley, Denbigh</hi> and <hi>Ruthén,</hi> and returned to the Leaguer upon Saturday: In all the march we found the country well-affected to us, not wanting in courteous entertainment, rejoycing in our ſucceſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing freely to the relief of the Leaguer, tendring their aſſiſtance as opportunity might ſerve, for reducing of the country: A people rather to be pitied for their ignorance (whoſe Leaders have taught them to erre) then ſpoiled for their malignity.</p>
            <p>Col: <hi>Iones</hi> with the Cheſhire and Darbyſhire horſe, upon their return took up their Leaguer quarters cloſe by Hawarden caſtle, and Col: <hi>Maſſey</hi> with about 400 foot in Hawarden town, which (though the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was dangerous, and requiring much duty) proved very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious for the Intercepting of all relief that might come from thoſe parts of Wales to the City: The Enemy perceiving our poſture, utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of ſending relief by land, and applyed themſelves to attempt that deſign by water, for the effecting whereof they fraught a Veſſel with a good quantity of Wheat, Bacon, Beefe, and ſuch like proviſion, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the Wind, Tide and their Oars, might ſecure them to paſſe our Boats, when the ſwelling River made the courſe paſſable beſides the Channel: To the preventing of which, nothing was left unattempted that might conduce to the guarding of the River.</p>

            <p>To this no anſwer was returned the next day, which rendred the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as broken off, and occaſioned us to endeavour the further blocking up of all paſſages for releife of the City. Upon Wedneſday <hi>Ianuary.</hi> 14. a party of Horſe and Foote were ſent to quarter in <hi>Holte,</hi> thereby that Caſtle was blockt up, which was accuſtomed to range abroad dayly into Cheſhire, to the great prejudice of that waſted County, which alſo proved a poſterne, by which ſome ſmall releife many nights was ſent into the City. The charge of this worke was undertaken by Generall <hi>Mytton,</hi> who came ſo unexpected upon the Towne that he tooke 32. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and 3. perſons Priſoners: but the next day, being overſecure in their quarters, about 14. were ſurpriſed by the enemy, out of the Caſtle. This blocking up of the two neighbour Caſtles rendred to the enemy their condition deſperate of any conſiderable releife, unleſſe by a potent army.</p>

            <p>Upon Munday about noone, they ſent a long Letter without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions expected, the contents whereof was, to excuſe their not ſending in of propoſitions for want of time fully to deliberate upon things of ſo great importance. Alſo they nominated 12. men for Commiſſioners, conſiſting of the Gentry, Souldiery, Citizens, and Clergy, becauſe all theſe had their ſhare in the treaty, deſiring Sir <hi>William</hi> alſo to nominate perſons of that number and quality on his part, and to deſigne a place where they might treat. Sir <hi>William</hi> tooke it not well, that they ſent not the propoſitions, as was expected, and approved not of ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Commiſſioners; therefore he required their propoſitions ſpeedily, or to expect no further treaty, the next day they ſent againe ſignifying, their propoſitions were ready, but they would not ſend them by Drumme or Trumpet, but by Commiſſioners, which they deſired might be agreed upon, the place deſigned, and their perſons protected. Anſwer was made to the Lord <hi>Byron,</hi> that if they ſent propoſitions into the Suburbes, by two perſons of their choice, they ſhould have ſafe conduct. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they ſent 36. propoſitions upon Thurſday <hi>Ianuary</hi> 22. by Sir <hi>Edmund Verney</hi> and Major <hi>Thropp,</hi> which were ſo extreame high, that they were ridiculous, not fit to burden the Preſſe, or to reade, otherwiſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113465:19"/>
than to make ſport. Sir <hi>William</hi> then tendred to them his owne propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they utterly refuſed to take, becauſe they had no ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>Hereupon Sir <hi>William</hi> cauſed divers papers to be diſperſed upon the walls that night, which the Centries tooke in from our Souldiers, in which he ſignified their unreaſonable Demands in their propoſitions, and that they refuſed to take with them his propoſitions in which he ſought their good, and preſervation of the City, not doubting but this would worke a mutiny, and force them to a parlye in a more humble way.</p>
            <p>Their extremities cauſed them to pretend a deſire to continue the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, whiles new hopes of releife by late intelligence quickned their droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peing ſpirits to more than ordinary acclamations. For, upon Friday <hi>January</hi> 23. they reported to our Guards their great confidence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife by an army out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> already landed, and others to be aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to them in <hi>Wales,</hi> for joy whereof they ſhot off their Guns, and gave a great ſhout upon the Walls, and within the City, which they doubted not would prove effectuall to animate the gaſping Citizens, and to worke on us to allow them better conditions.</p>
            <p>But to cleare all on our part, Gen. <hi>Mytton</hi> with 800. Horſe and 200. Foote and Dragoones. <hi>Ianuary</hi> 25. marched into <hi>VVales,</hi> quartered that night in <hi>Ruthen,</hi> endeavouring to finde out and diſipate that body of the enemy, what ever it might prove, under the command of the Lord Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Collonel <hi>Iones</hi> the day after ſent a party towards <hi>Ruthland</hi> Caſtle, hoping thereby to incloſe the enemy, or interrupt them in the way, if they attempted the releife of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> whiles ſo great a party of ours was abroad in the Country. The enemy not appearing, the party ſent out by Collonel <hi>Iones</hi> made a ſpeedy returne with a booty of Horſe taken from the enemy, who had ſecured them in <hi>Ruthland,</hi> and good ſtoare of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for reſtitution of which the Country there payd their arreares of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution for the Leaguer. But Gen. <hi>Mytton</hi> continued in <hi>Ruthen,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great hopes of the Caſtle, deſtitute of the Governour, Ammunition and fuell.</p>
            <p>This while the Citizens were more ſenſible of their deſperate conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the Commanders, reſolved to feede no longer upon lyes, which had brought them a long time to feede upon horeſſleſh ſo they forced the Commiſſioners to treate with us, and to make the beſt concluſion they could but however to conclude, Upon Friday <hi>January</hi> 30. their 12. Commiſſioners were admitted into the forreſt ſtreete, which ſent the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113465:19"/>
ſame number of able men to joyne with them they continued late that night in debating the propoſitions but the worke drew not towards a period. Our Commiſſioners agreed, that unleſſe they came the next day by 12. a clocke and ended by 6. the treaty ſhould ceaſe: they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to deferre it till Munday, which would not be admitted, ſo they all met upon Saturday, continued the treaty all night, and all the next day. Our Commiſſioners held them ſo cloſe to it, that they yeelded to very hard conditions, which becauſe they will be publique, and larger then will ſute to this ſhort narration, ſhall not burden this paper.</p>
