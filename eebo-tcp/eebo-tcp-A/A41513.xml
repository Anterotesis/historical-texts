            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Just and Sober Vindication of the Observations upon the Thirtieth of <hi>January,</hi> and Twenty ninth of <hi>May.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I NOT out of any Peevish Humour, but in my Judgment, being Dissatisfied with some Yearly Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises, not about Trifles, but such Matters as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Honour of God and Wellfare of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be concerned in, as not to Defile the Worship of God with any Mixture of the Creature, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move such things, as being made standing Monuments, do continue, and will perpetuate Divisions and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, have taken the Freedom to publish my Thoughts thereupon, without design of wronging any Man, as I hope I have not, but have spoken forth the words of Truth and Soberness: Yet it seems what I have written, hath somewhere lighted upon a Sore place, which cannot endure to be touched; and this hath made the Party not only to Start, but to fly out; a Sound Part can suffer to be handled, when an Unsound one doth not; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one Wasp makes as great a Noise as the whole Nest.</p>
            <p>Well, the Matter was Combustible, therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if it so easily hath taken Fire, and hath broken out into a Flame, like those Fire-brands by <hi>Samson</hi> put to <note place="margin">Judges 154. 5.</note> the Fox's Tail, all intended to Ruin and to Destroy, as those did in the Field; but these shall do no Harm, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be at Home, and upon the Contrivers: Some Vapors from the Spleen and low Parts, do sometimes cause great Fumes and Disturbances in the Head, as do Exhalations from the Earth in the middle Region of the Air, but at last after some Lightning and Noise of Thunder
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40938:3"/>
and Wind, they return and fall upon the Earth in Hail, Rain or Snow: So that windy and stormy Noise in the Head, after a while ceaseth, and, to make use of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s words, is <hi>as the Cracklings of Thorns under the Pot.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Though the Pamphlet in question be not in any thing worth a Reply, and the Pamphleteer deserves to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered otherwise than with a Pen; yet for it I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to stand the Judgment of any Rational and Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Man: But least he should be pussed up (as many of that Spirit are apt to be) with a Conceit of himself, and least some People should think the worse of the Cause for my Silence, I must say something in answer to it, and if he hath any thing to write against my Reasons, let him do it as a Gentleman and as a Scholar (though his Pamphlet proves him to be neither) and then I hope in God to cut him Work more than he shall be well able to compass.</p>
            <p>Reason and Experience do teach us, how in this World all Men cannot be of one Mind, no more than all have the same Features: Rational Men will Discourse and make use of Arguments to find out the Truth, yet without coming to Sword and Dagger; the striking of two Flints one against another doth produce Lights, so sometimes Debates and Disputes bring out Truth, and make it known; nay, with greater Light and Certainty than it was before; as the Sun appears Brighter and more Glorious after it hath dispersed Clouds that stood between it and our Aspect. For my part I declare, I love not Dispute for Dispute sake, but to find out the Truth: I am always, and so every Rational Man ought to be, ready to receive better Information; and if any one convinces me to be in the Wrong, I will thank him and follow the Truth, if made appear to me; and if in any thing I be otherwise minded, with St. <hi>Paul</hi> I hope <hi>God will reveal it to me.</hi> I most fully am perswaded of <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> the Truth of what I have written; and though I do not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40938:3"/>
believe there is in any one Man or Society, a Spirit of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility; yet I am most sure, the Rule I endeavour, as much as God enableth me, to follow, namely his Word, is Infallible; there I stick, if any one out of it doth convince me, I shall yield to the Conviction, or else continue to assert my Opinion: And in this case, what the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth used to say in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I assert, <hi>Fortune and I,</hi> said he, <hi>against any two:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Yo y la F<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na contra dos otros.</note> So upon a much better account, say I, <hi>Truth,</hi> that is the Word of God, <hi>and I,</hi> against any two Adversaries whatsoever.</p>
            <p>But must in this World the Will of one Man be the Rule of another Man's Will; and the Judgment and Opinion of one, be the Measure of that of another: I declare I have not such an Implicit Faith, (that is the Prerogative of God's Will) and because I will not yield to it, must my Throat be cut for that? Or at least, must I be reviled with ill Language? It argues a very bad Cause that needs being defended by such Means, let Arguments and not ill Words be used, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they who employ Injuries and fly into Passion, do want Reason; Arguments as hard as you please, but soft words; certainly they who do otherwise, in the Opinion of Moderate Men, do prejudice their Cause: Against such our Blessed Savionr hath put the Word in my Mouth, <hi>If I have Spoken Evil, bear witness of the Evil.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 18. 23.</note> Shew me out of the Word of God the Falsity and Fallacy of my Arguments; Doth a Man think it below him so to do? Or rather, Doth he not find he cannot do it, that he betakes himself to Slanders and Injuries: Truth wants no such help, and by the Grace of God I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ashamed nor afraid to own it. None ought to be ashamed of the Gospel of Christ as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not, nor of the Truth of the Gospel which is the same, though some in these Corrupt Times, would put God's People out of Countenance, and make them afraid of owning the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40938:4"/>
Some Men in the World do little think upon that Precept of St. <hi>Paul Let your Moderation be known unto all Men,</hi> and the Reason is, <hi>the Lord is at hand,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 5.</note> and to judge: Violency and Impetuosity, too strong in some, is much opposite to that Calmness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not only in a Christian but also in a Reasonable Man; they who so highly do act contrary to this, and make themselves Drudges and Slaves to their Wrath or Passion, do not deserve to Converse with or enjoy the Society of the Civilised World, but only that of Brutes as their most proper Company: If that be an Effect of their Temper and Constitution, they ought to strive against and endeavour to overcome it, or else they must expect sometimes to hear of it: High Storms do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly leave behind some marks where they have been, and grounds of Complaints too: 'Tis but a Word and a Blow with some, but <hi>the Wrath of Man worketh not the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">James 1. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Righteousness of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If here I would take Advantage of the Law <hi>Talionis,</hi> and requit, it would carry one very far; but I have rather out of Scripture, whence I endeavour to draw my Rules and Comfort, to obey the Apostles Precept, <hi>Let all your things be done with Charity;</hi> whereof 'tis an Act sometimes to redress those than Wander in a wrong <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 14.</note> way, provided there be nothing of Hatred or Vengeance in the Heart; <hi>Solomon</hi> doth direct us how to do it, when he saith, <hi>Answer not a Fool according to his Folly,</hi> that is, in the same Extravagant Manner and Degree, <note place="margin">Prov. 26. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>least thou be like unto him,</hi> for if thou dost, thou shalt be as Fool as he, and be look'd upon as such: However, <hi>Answer a Fool according to his Folly, least he be Wise in his own Conceit;</hi> Consider him and not thy self, something must be done or said to him, least he groweth Proud and Vain, for such are apt to abound in their own Sence and not see their Folly; wherefore shew him his Error, and that he is no Wise nor Good Man, (for in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40938:4"/>
               <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Stile, a Fool is a Sinner or a Bad Man) though he fancieth himself to be Wise and Good: It is a higher degree of Folly in one to proclaim himself such, and to publish it abroad, than if he could confine it within his own Doors; and if one through Infirmity cannot master it, yet he is to endeavour in some degree to curb and keep it from breaking out: However answer him, saith the Wise Man, though not according to his Folly, and as Severely as he deserves, yet he must not go unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, least he should think he hath done well and failed in nothing. And if when one is about such a Work, the Man should happen to Vex, and Fret, and fly out, as 'tis usual with such, it were proper to put to him the same Question as the Apostle did to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Am I therefore become your Enemy, because I tell you</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 16.</note> 
               <hi>the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chief and I may say the only end I herein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to my self, is to bear record unto the Truth, and to such a Truth as deserveth in a special manner to be regarded: But in order thereunto, I would have Men to shoot at the Mark and keep to the Point, and not to go straggling here and there, and so miss the aim: Let us search into the Merits of the Cause, laying aside all by and cross Questions and Discourse, except they do contribute to the Clearing of the Matter we are about; and when that is over, in God's Name we may proceed to new things, but let us make an end with one before we begin with the other, and that's the likeliest way to clear the Truth; on and off, fast and loose, cannot do it, but sticking to the Point can; but ever forbearing to give ill Language.</p>
            <p>If I wanted a Witness for some things I said in the <hi>Observations,</hi> I have him now, and is seasonably come in from amongst our Adversaries, by his own Example to demonstrate what manner of Spirit some of them are acted by; I leave those whom this belongs, to apply
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40938:5"/>
it to themselves, how little Salt and how much Mercury there is in them, how Fierce, Fiery and Violent a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per they are of; and I refer it to the Judgment of Sober and Impartial Men; such Principles, if reduced into Practise, are enough to work Confusion and Ruin, and to overturn whole Nations and Kingdoms: These, in Imitation of <hi>Papists,</hi> they would with all their Heart promote with Fire and Fagot, whereof too many have had a Sad Experience, which hath afforded continual grounds of Complaint: And this I desire the Moderate Reader to take notice of, and consider whether Lives, or any thing else we have, could be Safe, if it should again be in the Power of such Men to Persecute, of such Men I say, for I am not so Unreasonable as to Father it upon all. We know how those that amongst them are Moderate, and will not come up to that Violence as themselves are for, they be Angry against and Revile them with the Names of <hi>Trimmers</hi> and the like: So that a Pen between the Fingers of such Hot-spirited Men, is as a Sword in the Hand of a Furious Person, who striketh on all sides, and spareth neither Friend nor Foe, except to a Hairs breadth they come up to what they would have them.</p>
            <p>How Brave and Generous Champions of the Church are these, the Honour and Ornament thereof? with how much Credit do they Promote and Maintain that Cause? Revilings, Injuries and False Aspersions are their Weapons; in their whole Carriage they be very Angry, yet without any Ground but their own Temper, which must needs be very Cholerick: Against such <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> gives a necessary Warning, <hi>Make no Friendship with an Angry Man, and with a Furious Man thou shalt not go:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 24.</note> But in this World we sometimes meet with that kind of Company, as there is now an Instance in the Case. I am sure such an Unhandsome and Uncharitable Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, cannot be justified either by Gospel or Law, no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40938:5"/>
not that of the Land; but them we leave to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges, who are or certainly ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in such loud Miscarriages, and to the Judge of the whole Earth, who <hi>hath appointed a day in the which he will Judge the World in Righteousness, by that Man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 17 31.</note> 
               <hi>whom he hath ordained;</hi> and he is no Excepter of Persons.</p>
            <p>But we must examine what is written against the <hi>Observations,</hi> and so shall by the Grace of God begin with the Title Page, which is so stuffed and filled up, that the Pamphlet should be very bulky, if it held a Proportion with the Title; but 'tis like that sort of Trees that have more Bark than Body: So that take away the Abusive Language and Nonsence, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main very Empty: And as we all (as our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour saith) shall be Judged and Condemned by our Words, so I shall make use of the Author's own Words, for he puts them into my Mouth. His Title is, <hi>The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former Rack'd:</hi> A Man who so much pretends to the Law, would bring in a thing which the Law of the Land doth not admit of; but Tyrannical Spirits can find no bounds to their Cruelties, he brings in a Patient, that's the <hi>Reformer,</hi> the act <hi>Racking;</hi> he must give us leave to find out the <hi>Agent,</hi> and that's himself which he cannot deny: To Rack and put Men to the Torture, is the Office of the Hang-man, and whosoever puts Men to the Rack, doth act the part of the Executioner, who is ever paid before-hand when he is to do Execution; whether our Man hath his Fee, some good Preferment already; or whether he intends to deserve it or more, we do not therein concern our selves: However like another <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he makes a Tumultuous Noise for his <hi>Diana,</hi> which is no more in Danger than was that <note place="margin">Acta 19.</note> of <hi>Ephesus:</hi> Here is our Man who would extort things, and force out that which is not, for the Violence of the Torment, makes sometimes Men say that which is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40938:6"/>
not true, nor was ever intended; so Men may find my Writing hath been put to the Rack: The very name of Racks and Tortures sound very ill in the Ear of a True Christian: We read of those that were <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,</hi> and <hi>had trial of cruel Mockings and Scourgings,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 35, 36</note> 
               <hi>of Bonds and Imprisonment:</hi> This very same, <hi>England</hi> hath cause to remember, when it was in the Power of such Men as our Adversary to Persecute their Brethren: But these things of new Date and fresh Memory we leave off, by the by to mention things of an older stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; thus <hi>John Hus, Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and Thousands more of Faithful Witnesses were Rack'd to Death; our <hi>Wickliff,</hi> Forty one Years after his Death, his Bones were taken out of his Grave, and were Rack'd as far as they were capable of: And I am apt to believe upon good ground, that if <hi>Calvin,</hi> and others of the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Reformation (for indeed God was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former) were now alive, and should fall into the Hands of our Rackers, they would have Rack'd them to the Purpose; they would not have been better used than if they had been in the Hands of the <hi>Romish Inquisition;</hi> if they had not been Burn'd, they had at least been Hang'd: Oh such Spirits, such Principles, Dispositions and Cruel Practises, should be left for the Whore Drunken with the Blood of Martyrs: What kind of Hearts do some Men discover to be in them, as if <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 6.</note> possessed with Rage and Fury: Our Blessed Saviour saith well, <hi>Out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 6. 45. and Matt. 12. 35.</note> 
               <hi>speaks:</hi> Cruel Men, and Tyrant's Brains, are so full of Idea's of Torment, Tortures, Racks, Fire and Sword, that they can hardly think or speak of any thing else.</p>
            <p>Now we must come to the Patient: The Rack is not for those who Deform, but for the Reformer: Doth not this here justifie what I said in my Observations, how there are some who hate not only the thing, but also the very Name of <hi>Reformation, Reformed</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40938:6"/>
               <hi>Reformer,</hi> for this is pointed at as an Odious Name, and as a common Enemy to his Party, though it be a Scripture word which speaketh <hi>of a time of Reformation:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 10.</note> Some of them are bred with an Hatred of Godliness, and of the Professors thereof: We have too many of those who hate Reformation in Doctrine, Worship and Discipline, in the Heart which is most necessary, and in Manners and Conversation; Thus they will say, What need we Reformation? We are Whole and so need no <note place="margin">Luke 5. 31, 32.</note> Physician, We are Righteous and so no need of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Let us see what a Character God gives, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently what will be the Doom of those who hate Reformation, <hi>But to the Ungodly, saith God, Why dost</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>thou preach my Laws, and takest my Covenant in thy Mouth, whereas thou hatest to be Reformed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to the purpose of our Reformation here, I must not omit mentioning, how a Parliament being holden in the Thirteenth Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, some Prelates and others were sent from the Convocation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, to Exhibit her a Subsidy according to Custom: The Queen took occasion to speak well and favourably of the Good of Christ's Church, affirming, she had heard of many things in the Church which 'twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary should be Reformed, and which if she came but to understand, she would not give sleep to her Eyes till she set up Reformation, and would never give over till she had done it indeed: And if they, being the Eyes, would not reveal the Truth, let the Blame and Blood be upon them. But they, instead of answering so Good and Pious a Motion, for a Work so worthy of so Excellent a Princess, put a false Gloss upon things, disguised the Matter, and said <hi>Omnia Bene,</hi> all was well: And thus they put a stop to that which was their Duty to have promoted; thus ever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was afraid, and hated to hear of Reformation in Head and Members, so loath are all Worldlings to part
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40938:7"/>
with any thing of their Pomp, Pride, Power and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: However we must know that the best Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were the Reformers, and that Reformation was not the Work of one day or of one Man, but was wrought by degrees and at several times; and as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this World is so perfect, but that at one time or other Abuses happen to creep in, so 'tis the Duty of those that are concerned, to see Abuses Reformed: And if God had not been pleased to infuse that good Spirit of Reformation into the Hearts of some Princes, and of Pious and Learned Men, we had still continued in the Darkness, Ignorance, Idolatry and Superstition of Popery; and some Men in the World are little Thankful for so great a Mercy which so many of our Predecessors sealed with their Blood and Lives, yet to many Reformation is a <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> come not near, why? because they love themselves, their Ease and Pleasure, more than the Glory of God and the Good of his Church, if they can but quietly enjoy them; that's their chief Desire in this World, with <hi>Peter</hi> saying, <hi>'Tis good for us to be here,</hi> but they no more than he at that time, <hi>know what they say,</hi> when they talk as if <note place="margin">Luke 9. 33.</note> there was no need of Reformation; would to God it was true, but there is a great need of it (as it hath been proved at several times) and now as much as ever, as upon occasion it may plainly be demonstrated: It is strange, yet too true, that a Name which ought so sweetly to sound in the Ears of true Christians, should in the Ears of some strike a kind of Horror and a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in their Hearts; may be they are possessed with the <hi>Pharisaical</hi> and <hi>Popish</hi> Opinion of a Perfection in this Life.</p>
            <p>We read how hainously a Pope took it, when one day a Minister of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth speaking <note place="margin">Sleidan.</note> against transferring the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to another place, made use of the word to <hi>Protest,</hi> because those
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40938:7"/>
who in <hi>Germany</hi> withdrew from him had before used it; but 'tis a sad case, that Antichrist should be imitated by some who pretend to be fallen out with him: 'Tis true they agree about the ground, and they all have the same Reasons, namely their Interest; O that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, the God of this Wicked World; there is at this time too much cause to repeat St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Complaint, <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 21.</note> how most, if not all, care for themselves, love this present World, but few care for the things of God: Can any one deny the great and general Apostasie in these late Times, from the Power and Practise of Godliness? Can any one deny the Corruption that is in the Sanctuary as well as in other Bodies of the Nation? And that bad Examples and ill Rules too, come from whence we might look for better ones.</p>
            <p>At a <hi>Diet</hi> at <hi>Worms,</hi> where <hi>Luther</hi> appeared before <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, his Protector the Elector of <hi>Saxomy</hi> asked <hi>Erasmus,</hi> then in the same publick Room, what he thought of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Books; he in his jesting way said, <hi>Luther</hi> was to blame: The Prince replied, Wherein? Because, said <hi>Erasmus,</hi> he hath meddled with two very Nice and Dangerous Things, namely, the <hi>Pope's Mitre,</hi> and the <hi>Priest's Belly;</hi> if that had been let alone, said he, a way of Accommodation might have been found out. Thus if Reformation would not be extended upon the Power, Jurisdiction and Authority of our Churches Heads and Governours, and the Fat Livings, and a more equal Distribution of Church Preferments and Incoms, and a bringing in a laborious Preaching and Praying, and well-living Ministry, which flow Bellies and lazy Labourers do not like (this, let it be spoken with relation only to some) then Proposals about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation might happen to meet with a better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. 'Tis a sad case when they would make Men ashamed for speaking Scripture-Phrase as <hi>Predestination, Presbytery</hi> and now <hi>Reformation;</hi> it seems if one would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40938:8"/>
speak to them the Language of the Beast, they could better understand it.</p>
            <p>But why should I any longer stand upon so copious a Matter, which affords so much of Consideration, into which a thinking Man may see very far, things being so palpable and visible to an unprejudiced Eye? And there may be an occasion in the Continuation of my Discourse to take notice of it, and to own, that though Reformation be some Mens Aversion, yet there is a just Necessity for it, as in several Instances and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars it may easily be made to appear. Thus much for the poor <hi>Rack'd Reformer,</hi> whose Limbs must need, after this Terrible Execution, be quite broken, or at least wholly out of Joynt.</p>
            <p>To return to our <hi>Racker,</hi> whose Head runs so much upon Martyrs and Confessors (which we may interpret King <hi>Charles</hi> Martyr for Hierarchy, and the late King <hi>James</hi> Confessor for Popery) that he can hardly, save ill Language, speak any thing else: When he talks of the <hi>Reformer's Confession,</hi> to which we might say, What, of Faith or of Fact? He hath done well to explain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Or Observations considered,</hi> for we are so dull, as not well to apprehend things at the first sight; yet we know what we must expect, for in the very Title he declares his Writing to be a Reflection, taken, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, in a bad Sence, for 'tis an Invective, but he saith 'tis a brief one, for one long-breathed, as he is in such Matters, and nothing else, but a Reflection: Well, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, but I will not say, and be reflected upon for we have not so learned Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which is added a new Discovery of Old</hi> England: A new Coat made of an old Cloak; whilst we could wish these Old Things to be made away and buried in Oblivion, they would daily revive, to what good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I cannot see; he declares himself to be an <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner;</hi> if it was only to Titles of Books, one would not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40938:8"/>
mind it; but Additions to Institutions and Ordinances of Christ we must not admit of, and that's one of our greatest Complaints that they do it. The Authority of his Quotation with the two Greek half words '<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. is Apocripha to us; I never said any thing that may give Offence, relating to the Person which the words quoted, are by some attributed to; neither will I concern my self whether or not he be the Author of it, 'tis but a Dispute <hi>De lanâ Caprinâ,</hi> about a Trifle, whereby old Grudges are revived, which indeed I am very sorry to see, and wish Men would once for all leave off these things.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed farther, I declare I would never in this way have medled with these Matters without a very Just Cause; but who can forbear, after the high and continual Provocations they give us; they kill Men, yet would not have them to cry out Murther; let them hold their Hand and Tongue, and we shall stop our Mouth: Here in one respect they would use us worse than the Damned shall be in Hell amidst their Torments; leave shall be given them to Complain, but they would deprive us of it; as long as they still follow that Trade, and yearly Preach and Print such Passionate, Violent, Uncharitable and Seditious Sermons, they must look for Returns, and expect that one or other will answer them: They are not content to do amiss in that, but also for want of Reasons, they vindicate it with Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Injuries: Who would ever have thought, that one of them, may be, after Racking of his Brains to find out a Title for a Pamphlet, would make choice of a Metaphor drawn from the Office of a Hangman, who is a Man of Blood, applied perhaps to a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of whom the Saying is, <hi>Ecclesia non novit Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> The Church meddleth not with Matters of Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:40938:9"/>
My Design was to speak against a Practise which I not only take to be Unlawful, but also attended with Dangerous Consequences: The occasion of that Design was given, by so many Bitter and Violent Sermons pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished every Year: I gave my Reasons against those Anniversaries, and I answered what I hear and read to be spoken for it, and proceeded to some of the near and remote Causes of such Abuses; and as this keeping of such Days is a Ceremony, so 'tis Obvious from that <hi>Species</hi> to proceed to the <hi>Genus,</hi> and to go up to the Spring whence that Stream is derived; so that effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to say something against that Ceremony in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, it was very proper to speak somewhat about Ceremonies in general, though the former was the immediate subject of my Book: Hence I deduce this Argument, that if no Ceremony of that kind in general ought to be introduced into the Worship of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently this keeping of a Holy-day must not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church; and at the very beginning I declared I would not insist upon the Civil but the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <note place="margin">Page 2.</note> part of keeping those days. Now any Ingenious Man that had been dissatisfied with my Notions, if he had had a mind to meddle, would have gone about to convince me with Reasons and Arguments that I am in the Wrong; but the Author of the Pamphlet against my Observations, as if in him had been a Store-house of Bombs, Granadoes and Carcasses, and whatsoever else is more Combustible, took Fire; and from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning doth as good as say, I will hear none of your Arguments, you are a Rogue and a Rascal, I would Stab you if I could; and the Hand that strikes being Invisible, he curseth it and bites the Stone. God knows I had no other End or Interest, but to bear record for the Truth.</p>
            <p>In answer to him, we shall, by the Grace of God, first of all take notice of his Phrases, how Prettily,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40938:9"/>
Wittily, Judiciously and Christian like, he expresses himself; afterwards we shall proceed to some material things; those we shall divide into several Classes, the first shall be about his mean and unbecoming Language, having from the very beginning sung his Triumph over his <hi>Antagonist,</hi> as he calls him, whom he affirmeth <hi>to be sure to be worsted for his Pains;</hi> for proof thereof, he sends us to <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi> where we do not trifle our time, as may be he doth his amongst the Mob: <hi>Methinks,</hi> saith he, <hi>they might have learned from the Wrastling of</hi> Lincolns-Inn-Fields, Page 2. Much to be learned there indeed. He speaks of the <hi>Levitical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeus,</hi> a proper mixture of Scripture, and Heathenish Fables, <hi>ibid.</hi> In his Postscript-Advertisement he speaks of <hi>Assassines,</hi> which name doth belong to himself, for he saith, the Author of the <hi>Reproachful Observations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the deepest Stab from a Poyniarding;</hi> a word of his own coining; <hi>Scurrility,</hi> a rare piece of Rhetorick, Page 3. And <hi>it is pity,</hi> saith he of another, <hi>but he had his Teeth and Brains dashed out of his Head,</hi> Page 16. O excellent Frame of a Christian: He to shew himself more and more to have the Nature and Office of the Executioner, talks of <hi>Flame</hi> and <hi>Smoak</hi> in <hi>Palace-yard,</hi> Page 4. Formerly it might have been so, and would be so still, but I thank God we live in better Times, and are not under his Power. In another place he talks of Ropes, Page 17. and of a Gallows, Page 34. all these smell of a Hangman; alas if we were in his Power, he would kill us all with the Jaw-bone of an Ass. Elsewhere he talks of <hi>Sacred Ashes to Caper in the Air,</hi> and of <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes</hi> and <hi>Tunes,</hi> P. 5. Surely we shall not say to him as <hi>Festus</hi> did to <hi>Paul, Much Learning makes thee Mad;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Acts. 26. 24.</note> are we afraid of his <hi>Blocks, Halters, Gibbets,</hi> P. 18.</p>
            <p>The second Classis is about his Immodest and Unclean Language, <hi>The Impudentest Crack-Brothel-house-Pander, is able to match Pimping and Prostitution with her: It is the</hi>

These Lines of his do much edisie a Reader; one who hath the Fear of God can but nauseate, wherefore there we leave it off: Hath the Man never read what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>But Fornication and all Uncleanness, lei it not be once</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The third is concerning his Ridiculous Language, as thus, <hi>His Living may be his</hi> Delphos, <hi>and his Pluralities his</hi> Tripos, p. 9. <hi>Countries tolly Polly, hoite cum toite,</hi> p. 14. <hi>Swing a Swang a,</hi> p. 32. <hi>The Story of the Cock and the Glass,</hi> ibid.

What? is <hi>Oxford</hi> Famous for Jesting and Laughing? Or do they Jest or Laugh any way different from what is done in other places? He ought to be ashamed to give such a Character of a Famous University, of Jesting and Laughing at Serious things; he thereby discovers himself to be an <hi>Oxford</hi> Scholar, so he would make himself the Representative of the whole University, the Scum whereof he must needs be, and he would have us to take his Scurrilous Language to be the Sence of the Famous University of <hi>Oxford;</hi> such a Plant is of no Credit and Honour to the University, no more than to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40938:10"/>
the Church. Another Expression of his is, <hi>Tantivee Who-o-o-up,</hi> p. 42. other words he hath, as <hi>Contrasto's, Cargo,</hi> p. 19. <hi>Querpo,</hi> p. 10. <hi>Capricios,</hi> p. 13. <hi>Lurdans,</hi> p. 11. <hi>Rhodomantade Heaven, Sancha Pancha.</hi> He hath read <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> or heard of him, so no Wonder if he hath such Romantical Extasies and so right Notions of things; once at least let him speak as a Christian: His whole Pamphlet is nothing else but a Mixture of <hi>Bedlam</hi> and <hi>Billingsgate</hi> Language, which puts a Man to a stand whether to Laugh at or to Pity him, for certainly in his Brain, as well as in his Heart, things are out of order, he acts the part of an Insipid Buffoon upon the Stage, his Notions and Expressions are so much unbecoming a Serious Matter.</p>
            <p>The next is, his Scurrilous Reviling and Slandering Language, as <hi>a Fool-hardy Fellow,</hi> p. 2. <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> p. 4. But those who make the Word of God the Rule of their Faith, of their Life and Conversation, and of Gods Worship, are no Fanaticks; they are such who follow their own Inventions and Fancies, <hi>Schismatical Squeak,</hi> p. 5. <hi>Tantony-Pig-Israelite,</hi> p. 5. all one to him a Pig and an <hi>Israelite: Presbyterian Scriblers,</hi> p. 11. <hi>Myrmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons or Emmets of Presbytery,</hi> p. 12. <hi>Reveries</hi> and <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Convulsions,</hi> p. 6. <hi>Banditi, Raparies of Religion,</hi> p. 12. the <hi>Predecessors of his Jack-Catch-Kidney.</hi> And there is much more Bumbast P. 5. <hi>Singular Chymera's, Subtile Maggoticism, Zealous Phrensies or Whimsies,</hi> p. 13. <hi>the Presbyterian Cant, Passionate Folly, Spleen of Malice, Billingsgate Scold and Railery,</hi> p. 3. Here indeed, to make use of his own words, he calls Whore first; I leave any Impartial Reader to judge, whether I said any thing that may be called Scold and Railery, but 'tis all one to him, whether or not I have said it, he magiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially will have it to be so; but why should I any longer trouble my self with quoting such Speeches of his, his Pamphlet is wholly stuffed with it: <hi>These</hi> and more

            <p>Well, as I hinted something a little before, here he gives me a very great Advantage against himself, which I must not lose, for 'tis of too high a Concernment for me; he quoteth my words in Page 1, 3, 5. about the Fact, which though they be as positive as can be, yet in his Page 43. he affirmeth I say, <hi>The Martyr was Guilty, and that Justice was executed on him:</hi> How can these two things agree, the former words I own, the last I never said or thought: It is Matter of Fact, and what would it be if it was upon Matter of my Life or Death? Well, I shall unriddle the business, and shew where the Mistake lies; Mistake I call it, or Over-passionateness, for I thank God I have for him more Charity than he hath for me; others would call it a Rank Malice, but I call it a Mistake, but a very gross one; for what in my Book I say of <hi>Justice executed upon the Guilty,</hi> of his Death, that is upon his Judges, he would in his Book make me speak it of King <hi>Charles;</hi> at this let him blush and be ashamed: Now we may see who, he or I, be guilty of <hi>Imputations as Scandalous as False,</hi> as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth p. 43. God forgive him: And to declare my Mind more in general upon such Points, I say two things, First, When a Man suffers, though never so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly, yet in relation to God he hath nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, for as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>God is Just in all his Ways,</hi>

               <hi>and Holy in all his Works.</hi> Secondly, I say, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness

of God never excuseth the Wickedness of Men.</p>

Nobler in the Hierarchy; but to what purpose? What is the Dust he would excite? <hi>A warmer Discourse upon this Topick;</hi> Wiser he should have said, for Warmer it cannot be, for it is seven times Scorching-hot: In this same Page he gives a taste, as of his Charity, so of his Inspired Language, <hi>Omnium gatherum, Hotch potch, Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble jumble, risum teneatis;</hi> How much Pageantry, how much Pedantry from first to last?</p>

And here I must explain that Saying of mine, which our Author hath done what he could to Wrest, and give it a Sence contrary to my Intention, for when I said, <hi>They are the King's Creatures,</hi> I never intended to assert it ought not to be so, but thereby I meaned to shew, that Bishops, as Diocesan Bishops, are not <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> because they are a Man's Creatures, for the King makes them, which I take to be undeniable.</p>
            <p>I am weary (and so I suppose my Reader to be) of the Drudgery I hitherto have been at, to follow this Man thorough stinking Dirt and Mire; not that I thought the Work to be worth my Pains, but only to give a true Light of his Spirit and Principles; a Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Man indeed, who is not only for Racking, Burning and Hanging, but who would go thorough every part of a Hangman's Office: But now we are come to his <hi>Digressive Touches,</hi> which go so much out of the way, as hardly any more to come in; we must prepare to find such Stuff as we had before; for <hi>Uniformity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake</hi> all must Hang together: This Man hath a singular Gift of Mistaking, whether it be out of Malice or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, I am not so positive as to determine: I already have given one Instance, now there is another, he is so blinded with Passion, and so Impatient, as not to allow himself time, well to understand what he reads, thus he slumbles at the very beginning of my Observations, he quotes the words, yet wholly mistakes the Sence, my words are these, <hi>For either it,</hi> that is, the Occasion of the Day, <hi>looks upon the Act of some Men against the Living,</hi>

Who gave him Authority upon such Grounds to proclaim us Unbelievers and Miscreants?

of those Unfaithful Servants who hide the Talent; a Gown and a Surpliss are sometimes the Napkins wherein the Talents are hid; if they will not improve it, they should suffer it to pass into better Hands, of those that would: The Talents of Prayer are too often buried; <hi>But hark our Master of Divinity,</hi> for I think in this case I may well Retort, remember that at one time or other <note place="margin">Matt. 25.</note> you shall be called to an account for those Talents which some of you do sometimes bury in Idleness and Vice.

               <hi>Devotional Remembrance;</hi> my Devotion is only, wholly and directly for my God, he is graciously pleased to allow me coming to him at any time, without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductor or Master of Ceremonies: I declared I thought his Death unlawful, I approved once Mourning for it, and one Humiliation-day, but not for ever. But <hi>Why not twice,</hi> saith he: Nay for once or twice more I would not stand out with him, if only occasionally, but once every Year at a certain fixed day turneth it into Abuse, once is no Custom, one Act may be Harmless, when an Habit makes it a Sin, and of all Sins the Customary ought to be avoided. But <hi>why once for all,</hi> saith he. My answer is, <hi>Once,</hi> because our Nature may be allowed to vent out her Sorrow; 'tis an Infirmity of Humane Nature, to be grieved for Losses and Crosses, and it easeth one to unload himself of that Affliction whereby the Heart is affected: Thus a Father or a Friend may express a Trouble for the loss of a dear Son or of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Relation, as I instanced in the case of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joseph:</hi> But <hi>once for all,</hi> because all Excesses must be avoided, Afflictions ought not to be Immortal, when once we have paid the Memory of Friends that Tribute, we ought to mind better things; we are not placed in this World evermore to Sorrow for the Death of others, though never so Sensible to us, either in it self or for the manner of it, but to fit and prepare our selves for our own; or rather, as much as in us lies, to promote the Glory of God; and as far as God will enable us, to work our own Salvation with Fear and Trembling; and when we have a mind to Mourn, there is in us cause enough for it, namely, our Sins. I do not mind his taxing me with Repetitions, what he calls so, are but Enlargements and Explanations, which being a new Charge, makes him concerned thereat.</p>

Now are we come to that which is most material in the Point, How <hi>it is contrary to true Religion to keep the Thirtieth of January:</hi> Let us take notice how he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, <hi>This is the Scare-crow that keeps the Rook out of our Vineyard: 'Tis just as a Nurse cries to the Child, Pah, Pah, doth he take us for a company of silly giddy Larks, or Weather cocks, unstable Rushes, this call sounds sweetly, like the Hyena's Voice,</hi> &amp;c. At this rate he fills up a whole Page, which no doubt is very convincing, only I must own he saith, <hi>This grand Charge he groundlesly advances,</hi> when Page 11. and from my Page 27 till 40. I give Reasons, and chiefly discourse upon that Matter which I must not trouble my self to repeat; what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows is as convincing as what went before, <hi>King</hi> Charles <hi>hath with a Judicious Foresight given a brave Counter-Cuff to our Round head Disputant:</hi> That Authority, he thinks, can frighten us all out of our Wits, there it lies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he brags thus, <hi>Here is a Rowland for his Oliver;</hi> and I say, Here is a <hi>David</hi> for his <hi>Goliah,</hi> who comes indeed <hi>with a Sword, with a Spear, and with a Shield,</hi> when <hi>we come in the Name of the Lord of Hosts:</hi> I mean <note place="margin">1 Sam. 17. 45.</note> his word, whence we draw our Weapons and our Strength (which he neither doth nor can do,) to decide these Matters, I do not mind what K. <hi>Ch.</hi> and he do say, but what God saith: For a further answer to the Charge, within six Lines he gives us an <hi>Hercules</hi> and his Foot, a <hi>Lyon</hi> and his Paw, a <hi>Jackall,</hi> and a <hi>Monkey with her young ones,</hi> besides <hi>Mince-Pies</hi> and <hi>Custards,</hi> and the Battlements of <hi>Heaven which is so easily unbuttoned, a Saw-pit,</hi> Daniel<hi>'s Den, his Tipling Hostess, railing against Candles and Burnt-Claret;</hi> then comes the <hi>Cowardly Bully, Roaring, Hectoring and Fighting.</hi> Who can or dares answer these Convincing Arguments, delivered with an affected Singularity, in a Language of his own? And more of that kind, to prove how keeping the Thirtieth of <hi>January</hi> is not contrary to True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40938:25"/>
This is all we are like to have of him in the Point.</p>
            <p>But that which ought undisputably to decide the Question is this, That the words he hath quoted out of the Book of his new Gospel, I mean the <hi>Royal Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture,</hi> are <hi>the words of a King, a Scholar, and an Orator,</hi> but for my part I am for the words of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, who saith by the Mouth of a Prophet, which hath something more of Weight and Authority than the Pamphleteer, that which is much to our Purpose, and admirably fits our case. <hi>Now let them put away their Whoredom, and the Carcases of their Kings</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 43. 9.</note> 
               <hi>far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever:</hi> These Carcases of their Kings were some Monuments of Idolatry erected to <hi>Manasseh</hi> and <hi>Amon,</hi> who in his own <note place="margin">2 Kings 21. 23.</note> House had been killed by his Servants: In the seventh Verse God takes a special notice <hi>of the Carcases of their Kings in their high places:</hi> And in the eighth Verse he complains, <hi>They have even defiled my Holy Name by their Abominations that they have committed,</hi> Wherein? <hi>In their setting their Thresholds by my Threshold, and their Posts by my Post,</hi> that is, their Idols by his Worship, <hi>and the Wall between me and them,</hi> for there was but a Wall between it, for which God was so Angry with them, <hi>wherefore I have consumed them in mine Anger:</hi> But you will say they committed Idolatry about the Carcases of their Kings which we do not; I do not say you do, and hope you do not; in the Text Idolatry is not so much as named, but may be implied in the word Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; but you see the ground of God's Complaint is, <hi>Their setting their Thresholds by his Threshold, and their Posts by his Post,</hi> as if he had said, Why do you bring these Carcases near me? The Carcase and Idol are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to God, they neither hurt nor influence him, but he saith he will not have it so, nor any thing like it; Is it not Just he should be obeyed? Hath not God hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40938:25"/>
us with great Lights against Idolatry and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition? Hath he not declared himself to be a Jealous God, Why then do we provoke him with bringing an Idol of Jealousie into his House? Nay, in one respect we do worse than the Jews, for there was a Wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Thresholds and his Threshold; but we bring in the Carcase bare-faced within the Wall of God's House, where we have a Pulpit standing as it were between Mounts <hi>Gerizim</hi> and <hi>Ebal,</hi> with Blessings, Panegyricks and Flatteries of one side, with Injuries, Revilings, Threatnings and Curses on the other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, as I noted in my Observations, we have a Collect an Epistle and a Gospel, as well as upon <hi>Christmas</hi> and <hi>Easter.</hi> God indeed is a most Gracious God, but <hi>he taketh Vengeanee on Mens Inventions:</hi> Yet for all this they <note place="margin">Psal. 99. 8.</note> will not own they do ill, they Scorn it, but no reason they give for it, <hi>Sinegare sat est quis erit reus?</hi> If to deny it be enough, who can be Guilty?</p>
            <p>But we must proceed, in his Page 25. he is pleased to say, <hi>Yet this I must say for the Champion of Dissention, that he is no Coward or Faint Heart:</hi> With one Arm he would throw me down, and with the other lift me up. I leave any Impartial Reader of my Observations to judge, whether all along I am not pushing for Moderation, Quietness, Union, Reconciliation, Peace and Truth: It is usual with the Remoraes of Reformation, which must be the Basis of Re-union, to cry out with open Mouth, that Reformers are Troublers of the State: Thus <hi>Ahab</hi> called the Prophet <hi>a Troubler of Israel,</hi> but he was in the wrong: I think <hi>Zephaniah</hi> was no Troubler of the <note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 17. Zeph. 1. 4.</note> State, in putting on <hi>Josiah</hi> to cut off the Remnant of <hi>Baal</hi> and the Name of the <hi>Chemarins;</hi> and did our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour disturb either Church or State, when he whip'd <note place="margin">Matt. 21. 12.</note> the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple. <hi>Beza</hi> did in 1572. write Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a Letter for a thorough Reformation, which was kindly received; and though
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40938:26"/>
some about the Queen were not pleased with it, yet she took well the Advice; and though thorough other Mens Suggestions she did not follow it, yet she did not look upon him as a Disturber of the Peace of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: But anon I shall, by the Grace of God, say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to this Charge, in the mean while I will have them to know, that we desire the Word of God, not Man's Fancies and Inventions, to be the Rule of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation we have been speaking of; and that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion comes to be Good, Pure and Evangelical, because 'tis grounded upon the Gospel; he calls it <hi>Conventicle-Religion,</hi> he knows we were driven out of Churches, and had no more Liberty in publick to serve God, than the former Christians had under the Roman Emperors, and of late than the Poor Protestants in <hi>France:</hi> They cannot be ignorant how their Severe Persecution did drive us into Corners and by Places to serve God, for fear of being Fined and dragged into Prison.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Presbytery,</hi> as I perceive out of his Page 26. is to him as Loathsom as that of Reformation; and though this is a Matter copious enough, and which I, having other things more to our purpose, am unwilling to engage in, yet a few words I must bestow upon it, least he should think we avoid it. <hi>They misinterpret the word Presbyterian in the Fathers:</hi> Methinks the true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, such as <hi>Peter, Paul</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> speak clearly of it; the first calls himself a <hi>Fellow-Elder</hi> or <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 1.</note> Presbyter; and <hi>Paul</hi> left <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Creet</hi> to ordain Elders in every City; and the <hi>Gift that was in</hi> Timothy <hi>was</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>given him, by laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery. Luke</hi> tells us, how St. <hi>Paul, from</hi> Miletus, <hi>sent to</hi> Ephesus, <hi>and called the Presbyters,</hi> which is translated <hi>Elders of the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 14. Acts 20. 17. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Church;</hi> and the same which in that Verse are called Elders, in the 28th he calls Overseers, or <hi>Bistops,</hi> in the Original, and <hi>Pastors</hi> or Feeders of the Flock; where it appears those Elders, Bishops and Pastors, though
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40938:26"/>
under different Names, to be the same Persons, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising the same Office: St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth mention two sorts <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17. 1 Cor. 12. 28.</note> of Elders, some who Rule, others who besides do la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Word and Doctrine; so some <hi>Teach</hi> and others <hi>Govern:</hi> Thus some of the Fathers he means, as <hi>Cyprian, Austin, Jerom,</hi> &amp;c. interpret the word <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and thus far have I been led out of my way; but to prove our misinterpreting the word Presbyter, <hi>Julius Cesar,</hi> with his <hi>Positis Speculis,</hi> not to be understood of <hi>Perspective-glasses,</hi> but <hi>his Watch or Sentinel,</hi> are brought in for Witnesses; nay, <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Helena,</hi> the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> with the word <hi>Egg in a Text of Scripture,</hi> which the <hi>Presbyterians would interpret an Hen egg or Goose-egg;</hi> all this with Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s <hi>Facetious and Comical Table talk,</hi> with <hi>two Doublets, one plain,</hi> that is mine, <hi>the other fringed,</hi> that is his, for he and I are now the Actors upon the Stage; and the Conclusion of this Learned Debate is, <hi>That 'tis plain we have both a Doublet,</hi> and we might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen both to have given a Doublet to our Souls, but he saith, <hi>'Tis not Taylors work to take measure of our Souls.</hi> All these, I say, in this pretty and ingenious Discourse, are brought in to evidence <hi>we misinterpret the word Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter in the Fathers.</hi> What a pretty part am I, with this Nonsence, put to act upon this Stage? I intended to have answered him in a more Serious way, but one who Converses with Men that are Singular, must out of <hi>Complaisance</hi> sometimes comform himself to their ways.</p>
            <p>After these <hi>Irrefragable</hi> and Convincing Arguments, is he not in the right to ask, <hi>Will they still persevere in Ignorant Obstinacy, and differ from us in Religion and Unity of Performance?</hi> P. 27. And this attended with his usual Flourishes of Eloquence <hi>A-la-mode du Pareè, a Geneva Starchness:</hi> I thank God out of this Barren Field he brings us into one that is more Copious, which is, <hi>Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Altar:</hi> As for a time I am his humble Servant,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40938:27"/>
so I must follow him wheresoever he goes, as I perceive he would by his saying, <hi>How gladly would he Malice us into Popery,</hi> so that here I shall fix for a while, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>the Jangling of a pair of Tongs,</hi> nor <hi>the Harpsicles,</hi> nor <hi>his Organ,</hi> nor <hi>the Blind Fidler's Tunes,</hi> shall draw me off the more, because Page 29. he speaks of <hi>a great many Joynt stools,</hi> as I guess, for me to rest upon; now we must be more Serious.</p>
            <p>Take notice I never did nor do I now say you are Papists, I am neither so Rash nor so Uncharitable as you are, or as you take me to be: But this I affirm, That you retain Popish Rites and Ceremonies; and though I had no mind to meddle, yet seeing you put me upon it, I hope to make it out, for all your Flashy Wit in your Page 30. stay till last of all to declare me <hi>a Lunatick, a mad Misrepresenter, with my Bedlam Observations;</hi> 'tis not your insipid Jest, that <hi>if ye eat Plum-pudding and Roast-beef in a Cooks shop, we may perhaps call it a Papistical Ordinary:</hi> It seems he always hath a good Stomach, for great part of his Talk is about Kitchin-stuff, <hi>Bacon, Sugar, Plums, Mince-pies, Custards,</hi> &amp;c. However I say, <hi>If ye eat that which is Sacrificed to Idols,</hi> I may call things by their Name, and say you eat that which is Sacrificed to Idols; and if you know it, according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule, you ought not to eat: These Matters are not to be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed, for no Wise Men would do so. I shall begin with the Tale of the Country-man in <hi>Spain</hi> who would not Pray to St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s Image (he is one of your Saints, as of Papists) he might as well have called him St. <hi>Neptune, because he knew it was made of his own Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree;</hi> yet I have known Picture-drawers, who in the Church have fallen upon their Knees before Pictures of their own Drawing; what the Spanish Country-man would not do, yet some of yours do, <hi>Bow to,</hi> though they Pray not to the Altar; I do not say you adore a Moulding Carcase, but if you bring it, or a Picture of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40938:27"/>
St. <hi>George</hi> on Horse-back, or <hi>a Cross</hi> into the Church, and do Bow, Kneel, or shew any such Respect to it; I say you therein do countenance Idolatry, or at least Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition: Doth not the Second Commandment positively forbid to bow down before any Image, or likeness of <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 4, 5</note> any thing in Heaven, in Earth, or in the Water, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of St. <hi>George</hi> or of <hi>a Cross</hi> 'tis all one, God forbids it, will he have me to believe his Story of the Country-man, against two (for I have no less) places out of God's Word; <hi>The Carpenter, he heweth him down Cedars,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isa. 44. from 13 to 20.</note> 
               <hi>and taketh the Cypress and the Oak: Then shall it be for a Man to burn; for he will take thereof and warm himself; yea he kindleth it and baketh Bread: Yea, he maketh a God and worshippeth it, he maketh it a Graven Image and falleth down thereto:</hi> He knoweth what it is, namely, his Workmanship, yet he boweth to it: O sad! <hi>They have not known nor understand: For he hath shut their Eyes that they cannot see, and their Hearts that they cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,</hi> v. 18.</p>
            <p>My second Instance, to shew he goes upon a wrong Principle, when he saith, Do you think there is in us such an Ignorant Rusticity, that we should bow either to King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Carcase or to the Altar? We have no <note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> such Design or Intention, I will believe it, in the mean time they bring those Carcases into the Church, which you are forbidden to do, and bow to that Altar; 'tis no matter what your Intention be, whilst you perform External Acts of Worship: Do you think the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness could believe the Golden Calf to be the God that brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> no certainly, for they had given <hi>Aaron</hi> the Golden Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of their Wives Sons and Daughters, out of which the Calf was made; yet for all this they worshipped it, not terminatively, for they said, These be the Gods, O <hi>Israel,</hi> which brought thee out of the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and there was a Proclamation, to morrow is a Feast
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40938:28"/>
unto the Lord, they worshipped God under the Figure of a Calf, yet 'tis known what an Abominable Idolatry it was; and this was by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> followed, when he made the two Golden Calves: O let us keep to the Rules in a Religious place as is the Church; or upon any Religious Account not to bow to an Altar: Matter of God's Worship is a nice thing, his Directions must be followed, and nothing of Man's devising brought in.</p>
            <p>As good to bow to him that made the Altar as to the Altar it self, for it may be accounted a Civil Respect, but to the Altar 'tis a Religious one; yet there is as much reason to bow to the Pulpit as to the Altar, for from thence the Word of God is preached to us; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are not to give the Altar the Preference, except with Papists we believe there is the true Body of Christ either kept under a Wafer, or made at the pleasure of a Priest. I would willingly know, wherein the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence we pay to the Altar, doth differ from that which Papists with bowing their Heads and putting off their Hats, do render to the Cross: If upon or under those Altars, there were Relicks, they might say that Honour of Bowing is directed for the Relicks; but by good chance they have not the Relicks of many Saints and Martyrs to place there, or else they might happen to do it. Some of their Authors do not disapprove of Relicks, for Dr. <hi>Burgess</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">In his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder for Dr. <hi>Morton.</hi>
               </note> upon the Argument out of a <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian Council,</hi> how certain Altars erected for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Martyrs should be abolished, and all Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Idolatry be utterly destroyed; he with his Friend answereth, because those Altars were noted to be destitute of the Relicks of Martyrs; but addeth, that by those Altars destitute of such things, the Church was mocked: Would not a Papist give the same Reason? Well, the same cause, though by different Persons, must be defended by the same Reasons: Thus, provided there be Relicks according to his Opinion things are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40938:28"/>
well enough: How far into Dirt and Mire do Men tumble themselves over Head and Ears, when once they are engaged in the Defence of a Cause, not mattering whether or not it be Good, True and Just.</p>
            <p>I hope none will deny that God's Precepts ought to be the Rule and Measure of our Obedience; what God immediately commanded must be obeyed, though it should seem unreasonable and contrary to his other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will, I mean in Man's Apprehension; as in the case of <hi>Abraham</hi> to Sacrifice his Son, of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to make <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 2. Ezek. 4. 12. Hos. 1. 2.</note> himself Bread with Man's or Cows Dung, and of <hi>Hosea</hi> to take unto him a Wife of Whoredom; so must that be obeyed which the Lord hath immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Ministry of his Servants; and as he likes the Service we render him with Heart and Sincerity, with a willing Mind in obedience to what he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and this indeed in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words we may call our <hi>reasonable Service;</hi> so he likes none of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he hath not commanded, but are only a Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Man's Brain and Fancy; so are all Ceremonies in question, and this in particular, whereby the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of them give Papists so great an Advantage even against themselves; as we see in a Book I was lately reading, wherein the Author doth Handsomly and Ingeniously handle the Charge of Idolatry against the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but the Papist-Priest doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle him in this Point of Bowing to the Altar, with this Argument, <hi>The Church of</hi> England-men <hi>do Bow to the Altar, and yet they say they Worship not the Altar, but God before the Altar.</hi> So say <hi>Papists,</hi> We worship God before Images, but not Images: What an intricate La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth doth this bring him unto, only to defend an Idle and Superstitious Ceremony, not to speak worse? Papists and they do the same thing, for both bow to the Altar, and both give the same Reason, They do not bow to the Altar but to God, so their case is but one
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40938:29"/>
and the same: This Argument of the Papist doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them in so many Distinctions as are Superfluous and not directly to the Point; if they would but part with that Ceremony, that Objection would soon fall and cease; but they have rather to bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves nettling Difficulties, than to part with an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Ceremony.</p>
            <p>The Wisest amongst the Heathen pretended they look'd not upon their Images as Gods, but as Symbols of that Being to which they gave Divine Worship; our Church-men will not own they render the Altar any Worship, this would be openly to declare themselves Idolaters to worship the Creature, as none can deny an Altar is (as they after the Roman Stile are pleased to call it) or the Communion-Table; nay 'tis less, for 'tis but the work of the Creature, so a Creature in the lowest Degree; by the Bowing down forbidden in the second Precept, is signified any manner of Religious Worship, or Service to any Creature whatsoever: The distinction of Civil and Religious, is Idle and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; for here the question is about Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: The Altar is in the Church, which is God's House, the place appointed only for his Service: To say not the Altar, but God before the Altar is worshipped, and to give for reason, they believe not the Corporeal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, are but bare Shifts: As well as they, we know how Reverence is due in going in and coming out of God's House; but if every time one passeth before the Altar, though never so many, as sometimes there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for some of them to do it, is not that to have a special regard to that very place? For else why not as well to bow to the Pulpit, except they would make the Holy Word of God, that makes the Sacrament, to be less than the Sacrament, for the one is preached from the Pulpit, the other administred at the Communion-Table: Let then our Man confess there is something
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40938:29"/>
remaining of the old Leaven of <hi>Popery,</hi> they deny Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, but herein they act as if they believed it, and they make the Altar the Holiest part of the Church, which is all equally Holy, because wholly appointed to an Holy use, namely, the Worship of God: This is to look East and West, and so bring us back to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law.</p>
            <p>Is not the whole Church the Local Circumstance of Worship, seeing the whole is the place for it? This is to carry us back into the Tabernacle where was the Sanctuary and the Holiest of all; thus we make the Church the Sanctuary, and the Altar railed about the Holiest of all; but this while we do not consider how by Christ's Death the Vail of the Temple was Rent, and the Partition pulled down: 'Tis to no purpose for them to say there is an Invisible Object of Worship, when all Christians know that the only Object of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is Invisible; we also know, that God requireth of us a Bodily as a Spiritual one, though this chiefly; but God doth not require we should be stinted to a certain place within the Church, according to the Fancy and Prescription of Men, this were a Bondage indeed: But <hi>Papists</hi> do always worship towards the Altar, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when sometimes they go about to Kneel before some Image: 'Tis to make a Ridiculous Parallel to say, It may be objected Men worship their Hat, because at Church in Prayer they hold it before their Face; there is no such Canon to command or commend Praying with the Hat before the Face, 'tis a free act left to a Man's Liberty, and who knows not, 'tis to prevent having ones Thoughts distracted and diverted by Objects, and to recollect all the Spirits with more Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency and Application to perform the Duty one is about.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:40938:30"/>
The same Arguments they bring against Papists in point of Idolatry, we make use of against them about Altar-worship, for they say that External Acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship are capable of Idolatry, however the Intention of the Mind be directed, as I observed not much before; Is not this appliable to them as to <hi>Papists,</hi> about bowing to the Altar? Why should they herein be more privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged than Papists are? This External Act, let the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention be what it will, is capable of Idolatry, or at least of Superstition, in them as 'tis in Papists; God hath revealed his Will about outward Acts of Worship, and we must consider the Revelation he hath made of his Will in this Matter, for since God hath the Power to determine our Duty, and he knoweth best what makes for his Honour, it is but Just and reasonable, that we should judge of these things according to his Will: This Argument is certainly good, as against Papists, so against Protestants that bow to the Altar. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Rule, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve,</hi> doth forbid all external Acts <note place="margin">Matth. 4. 13.</note> of Worship applied to any besides God: Bowing to the Altar is always, upon all occasions, to that Place, and to none else; so it must needs be applied to it; 'tis <hi>soli, semper &amp; omni,</hi> which the Philosopher calls <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium quarto modo,</hi> the most essential Propriety and Attribute. Now that which is sin in one, in <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> is sin in another, though <hi>Protestant:</hi> To say, For such a one to lie with another Man's Wife, is Adultery; but for me, 'tis not so; is to be much in the wrong: And to make Idolatry and Superstition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend only upon the inward Intention, is all one as if one should say, Adultery is to lie with another Man's Wife, with an intention to Cuckold the Husband; but if a Man commits that Wickedness out of love to her Person, then 'tis not Adultery. A rare Doctrine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! So to worship the Altar, whereof to bow is an
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40938:30"/>
external Act, though not with an intention to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Creature, is still a worshipping of the Creature. This outward act of Bowing, forbidden of God to be done to any Creature, must need be appropriated to the Altar. 'Tis not enough to deny to clear themselves from it; else Papists denying they worship Images, would be a good Excuse. We cannot judge of Man's Intentions but by his Actions. In God's Words to <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> quoted by St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 2. 4. two things are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable to good purpose: <hi>I have reserved seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men</hi> (he saith not, they reserved themselves) <hi>who have not</hi> (he doth not say worshipped in their heart, but) <hi>bowed the knee to Baal.</hi> The Intention is not mentioned, but the outward Act is, which God takes special notice of.</p>
            <p>To compare the Circumstance of Worshipping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Altar,</hi> to that of the <hi>Jews</hi> Worshipping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Ark,</hi> where were the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> is to make a very lame Parallel, till they can prove two things: <hi>First,</hi> That as the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> by God's special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, were about the <hi>Ark,</hi> in such a place of the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle;</hi> so the <hi>Altar</hi> is with them, by the same Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in such a place of the Church, facing such a Point of the Compass, and rail'd about. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That God hath commanded them to worship towards their <hi>Altars,</hi> as he did the <hi>Jews</hi> to worship towards the <hi>Ark;</hi> which we defie them ever to do. But I am in this Point gone further than I intended; though more might be said upon it, and upon Cross and Surplice; but this is enough to shew, that the <hi>Author</hi> hath no cause to be angry; for we do him no injury, when we say they have amongst them the practice of some Popish Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which in the other Points I can clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; and I take him to be one of those, who have been heard to say, They would sooner be Papists than Presbyterians; but that against some other time.</p>

Now I find him in an Extasie, and doting upon, or admiring at some places of the Royal Portraiture; but with us, that's no Argument to prove the keeping an <hi>Anniversary:</hi> I love to read good things, and to make a right use of them, only in every thing we do, let us keep within bounds. He bestows his <hi>pag.</hi> 27. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these Quotations; but as I speak not against the Person, so I say nothing against the Book; let it be whose it will, I am not concern'd, though I believe 'tis for him a cause of great grief, that others cannot have of both the same Opinion he hath; but he must excuse us, for I live by Rules more than follow Examples. This Point I have spoken my Mind about, in my Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, so at this time shall trouble my self no more concerning it; I do not, nor ever intended, to wrong the Reputation of any Man, dead or alive, God forbid. I do not think that King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Rest and Credit doth in the least depend upon that Book, being his or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's; and when I speak against his <hi>Anniversary,</hi> I think not in the least to derogate from his Memory; for that's not his act, and so hath nothing to do in it. 'Tis not any thing I have against that King that makes me dislike the keeping that Day, but only because we believe God is thereby offended.</p>
            <p>Now, I thank God, he begins to draw towards an end, and then one would think his Venom should be somewhat spent; but upon the account of the other <hi>Anniversary,</hi> which he doth begin to speak of <hi>pag.</hi> 34. we find the contrary, as foolish and violent as ever; but we are already well used to his ways; nay, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd it from the beginning; for in him hath been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Saying, <hi>A fool's Wrath is presently known.</hi> Here he continues his old way of arguing, first, as good <note place="margin">Prev. 12. 16.</note> as this: Except this Birth and Restoration be kept, <hi>all Proceedings in</hi> Westminster<hi>-Hall, as the Act for the</hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40938:32"/>
so he had his Failings; those that arise out of Humane Infirmity may be excused, if they are of such a Nature as to admit it, or at least to be pittied, but truly those that are effects of a strong Corruption in Nature, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous, Willful, and contracted into an Habit, must no ways be approved, flattered or commended; these last things I speak of as modestly as can be, and the whole Nation knows what I mean; but those strong and different Streams of Vice which I complain to have overflowed the Nation, are not Slander nor meer Fancy, being obvious to the Eyes of all People; and I think it to be no Sin to desire it may be restrained and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, as I do again and again; I do not, as he falsly accuses me, Libel that King at random, God forbid, if that had been my design, which never was, I had gone on in a contrary way to that I have taken, but I have forborn naming so much as one Instance of many which several in the Nation know of: If our Author's edge had been turned another way, then indeed we could have heard of many things with Enlargements, but the World may know he and I go upon different Ground and opposite Principles; for, as far as God is pleased to enable me, I follow good Examples and avoid bad ones: But because he presses me so much with <hi>blackest Scandals,</hi> &amp;c. he forces out of me a thing which I was willing to be silent in, though so publick as the whole Nation knows, that he stained the latter end of his Reign with shedding Innocent Blood, which perhaps, for I adore all Dispensations of Divine Providence, was the cause of his days being shortned: As to what he saith of his great Clemency and Kindness after his Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to those who had been against his Interest, who, he slanderously saith, <hi>Hypocrited their Actions and Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated a Joy.</hi> I must tell him, he is grosly mistaken, for his own Friends, before he was restored, dared not to appear, if I may so say, they might not lift up their
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40938:32"/>
Hands any where but at the Bar; those who had been for the Parliament were the great and chief Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bring him in, whose Names are well known, and we very well remember that which those of his Party may not forget, of the Attempt to bring him in not long before he was, wherein many ventured their Lives, and some lost them, which at that time in the Printed Gazettes was, to my certain Knowledge, called <hi>Bellum Presbyteriale,</hi> the Presbyterian War; and that King himself after, in one of his first Speeches in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inviting them to settle things, said thus, <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen, Except ye help me to disperse the Fear which possesses the Hearts of People, you will hinder me from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming my Promise, without which neither you nor I had been here; wherefore let us not deceive those that brought us together, or suffered us to meet here:</hi> This Authority is authentick for the Man, and I know where that Speech is to be seen. After this I shall not trouble my self with the very few foolish Lines remaining of his Pamphlet, nor with his Impertinent new Discovery or Vision, he hath enough surfeited up another way, only I add, Let him if he can, disprove what in my Pages 13 and 14, I say of <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
            <p>As to the Point of Anniversaries, I shall very briefly bring in a new Matter to the Charge, 'tis about a third Anniversary which once we had, and should have had continued, if one Man, now in <hi>France,</hi> and been here still, that is, the Sixth of <hi>February,</hi> called the King's-day, or King <hi>James</hi>'s Coronation day, a Man, who being a professed Papist, was thereby become a declared Enemy to our Religion; it was attended with the same Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials and Workmanship as the other two, that is, Collect, Epistle and Gospel, as we have it in the Prayer-books Printed in his time; these Anniversaries are of a good Breed, of a multiplying Nature, within thirty Years or thereabouts we had three, and no doubt if things had
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40938:33"/>
held in that Channel, a kind of a Miraculous Birth of a Supposed Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> had been a just ground for another, for such a signal Mercy of an Heir Male to the Crown, surely would have deserved an Yearly Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving-day; thus the Prayer-book had been swelled with new Rubricks, Collects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Nation been overgrown therewith, and so from time to time we had never wanted Occasions or Pretentions of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to an Infinite. I dare say our Author is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server in private of that Sixth of <hi>February;</hi> thus there had been no end, for Superstition will not be kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Bounds or Measures; and here I must make the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who in several places doth unjustly brand us with Innovations, see how such Anniversaries are Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for here we had no such thing before King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Restoration, wherefore let there be no more such a Scuffle about Dead Bodies.</p>
            <p>Now, with the help of God I must proceed to some few Observations, and that as briefly as I can: First, He hath not returned me one Text of Scripture for so many I have given; yet the Word of God is to be judge of these Controversies; but indeed his way of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing is altogether inconsistent with that Holy Word; then I say, most of my Reasons are untouched, and hardly any thing answered, and nothing to the purpose; nothing said against my Position, That for such Anniversaries there is no Precept nor President in Scripture, the three pretended out of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I refuted, and not one word of the Refutation taken notice of, nor nothing said either to excuse or justifie that violent Spirit in those Sermons I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, only this, <hi>Their Gospel-Talents must not be wrap'd up in an Idle Napkin of Silence and Oblivion;</hi> which how Satisfactory an answer it is, I leave any Rational Man to judge; and indeed he had no room for Sober and Serious Discourse, his being wholly stuffed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40938:33"/>
with Invectives; I could instance several other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in my Observations, which he hath not taken notice of in the least, whereby one may see he hath lost his Cause: But not to trouble my self any longer as to this, I leave it to any Impartial Reader to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his Book with mine, which I do earnestly desire, and it will be found in many things he quite flies off from the Matter, and seeing I now am upon my <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> I declare I could never have thought there could in one Man meet so much of ill Nature, of ill Breeding, and so much of Brutishness, that one should be so Unreasonable and Unrational, for he ceaseth to be a Man, and a Christian too, if ever he was such; he would bite and devour if he could, but cannot, and 'tis hardly worth throwing a Stone at him: I am sorry he hath so much forced me out of my way of writing, which ever was, as every Honest Man's ought to be, with Moderation and Meekness, not with Fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Brutishness, as I found his to be.</p>
            <p>But there is worse than this, for he strives in the most odious Terms he can, to traduce us as Enemies to Church and State, but believe him not, for I find he is used to Lye: As to the first we subscribe, to the Doctrinal part of the Thirty nine Articles, and are for a Government and Discipline in the Church, for a Ministry by way of Office and in a lawful Calling, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his false Aspersions Page 6 and 24. We say Doctrine is the Soul whereby the Church liveth, and Discipline the Sinews by which Feeling and Motion is conveyed, and the Church thereby maintained; and yet we find some, as this Man, who hate Discipline, except it be their own, without considering whether or not it be Christ's, and the very name of it, as they abhor Reformation; Discipline keeps things in order, and Reformation restores them to a due State after Abuses and Disorders: So that whosoever is an Enemy

to Reformation, proclaims himself to be such to Order and Discipline in the Church, and is thereby a Favourer of Confusion; and 'tis not enough for one to pretend to it, for good Desires signifie nothing without earnest Endeavours; do ye the Work and leave the Success to God; and first begin at home: Is the Heart affected? Do you speak feelingly? Do you make Conscience of your ways? If so, then let me say, as long as we have such Members, and such Governours of a Church, we shall be sure not to want Order and Discipline in it.</p>
            <p>As to the things wherein they and we do differ, let us, according to the several Rules about it we have in the New Testament, in Charity and the Spirit of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, endeavour to Instruct and Inform, but chiefly to Edifie one another, and not put out one anothers Eyes, or have no other Terms but the Law of the Conqueror over the Conquered; we shall be ready to meet you in that Spirit, and though we were the strongest, it were unreasonable if we should attempt to prescribe you any thing, we never pretended to give any Frame of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or Government but what are set down in the Word of God, that indeed we stand for, and desire to have nothing settled in the Church but what is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rule of Scripture; let there be nothing but what there is a Warrant for out of it: In order thereunto all our desire is, that Cause with Cause, Ground with Ground, and Matter with Matter, be compared and determined, not to see things managed with Partiality, Faction and Interest, as in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> for then that which is intended for a Remedy strengthneth the Disease; and to speak with <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> dissolveth not, but fixeth Evil; at first a Council by Emperor and Princes asked of <hi>Popes</hi> was a Terror, chiefly a free one, for 'tis certain a guilty Man will never be, if he can help it, for coming to his Tryal
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40938:35"/>
for fear of being condemned; so they that are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to themselves of Abuses and Corruptions, will, as long as they can, avoid coming to a Reformation, which is desired in a quiet and peaceable way, the Word of God alone being the Judge.</p>
            <p>We are content in the Enjoyment of the Indulgence which they envy us, and some have preached against before the highest Assemblies, and, as we ought, give God Thanks for it, if they will but let us alone, and not go about as they do to provoke the Superior Powers against us, by means of those Violent Sermons they preach every Year upon those Anniversaries, when for fear old Divisions should be forgotten, they renew the Memory of them with a Witness. In several places he charges us with Hypocrisie, the Plague of the Heart, whereof God alone is the Searcher and ought to be the Judge: This is between God and us, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and him: But the Objection I answered in my Observations Page 41. he breaks loose upon us with so much Bitterness, as to call us <hi>Champions of Dissention,</hi> P. 25. <hi>Miscreants,</hi> P. 33. <hi>Assassines</hi> in the Postscript-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement, and fathereth upon us, <hi>Slander, Rebellion, Lyes, Perfidiousness, Villanies, Treacherous Conspiracies,</hi> and what not? Any thing that comes into his Head, in his Eye we are the Horridest Monsters in Nature, not to be suffered to live, as bad if not worse than the Devil, who if God gave him leave would not blacken us so much as he doth, as it appears out of his Method, when before God he suggested what he did against <hi>Job.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job 1 &amp; 2.</note> Thus were the first Christians misrepresented by their Enemies, such Picture-drawers deserve not to be allowed a Pencil in the Hand, for they never make the Copy to resemble the Original. Such Language as this, and such Sermons as we complain of, we have reason to look upon as so many <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Bells rung for a Massacre: In things we differ about, let us argue like Men, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40938:36"/>
not tear like Beasts. But 'tis not enough to make us Enemies to the Church, the Design is to proclaim us such to the State; first, as if we were Innovators, which in some places he would charge us with, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Church as to State, as in Page 9. If by No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties in Church he means Reformation, we own we desire that Innovation as was from the Ceremonial Law to the Gospel, such an Innovation as hapned when the Gentiles forsook their Idols to serve the Living God and believe in Christ; such as when our Fathers came out of <hi>Romish Babylon,</hi> such Innovations and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are for, and of what remaineth amongst us of that Spiritual <hi>Sodom,</hi> we are for; to desire to go to the Spring is no Innovation; we are for that Good Old way mentioned in Scripture, for that which was from the Beginning, as 'tis our Saviour's Method in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon upon the Mount, to Reform and bring things to the old Channel, and to what they were at first; one said well, <hi>Illud verum quod primum:</hi> But all Innovations against the Doctrine of Christ, or of his Apostles, were much against, and look upon them as Pernicious; so when there creeps any Abuses into the State, we could heartily wish to have them redressed in a Legal and Parliamentary way; and we think it not blameworthy, when in a due Course 'tis asked by those that have a right to do it.</p>
            <p>To make us Odious to Authority, they call us <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth-men,</hi> we own it in some Sence, that is, for the Common Publick Good, in Opposition to Private Interest; and we think he is not an Honest Man, who is not of that Principle, but a Democratical and meerly Popular Government, or any contrary to that settled by the Laws we are against: They say we are not for Monarchy, not for such as overthrows the Laws, ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally dissolves Charters, invades the Subjects Properties, openeth Popish Chappels all the Nation over, sets up
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40938:36"/>
Papists in those places which by Law they are excluded from: In a word, A Tyrannical and Absolute Monarchy we do not love, but such a one wherein the King hath his just Prerogative, Parliaments their Privileges, and People their Rights and Liberty; and the Law of the Land is the Standing Rule of Government; such a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, with Hearts, Hands and Purses, we will Stand, Live and Die for: And none but <hi>Villains</hi> will call us, as Page 33. <hi>Implacable and Impenitent Adversaries to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and present Majesty;</hi> and to be for a <hi>Fantastick Anarchy,</hi> P. 34.</p>
            <p>Another thing, and that is very Important, we must speak of, He hath not been satisfied to abuse us in relation to things already mentioned, he hath, as it were to defie God himself, reviled our Holy Faith; I am apt to believe, one word which drop'd from my Pen, and that is <hi>Arminianism,</hi> hath hit him to the quick, for now and then he is Spewing out his Venom concerning those Points against Grace, about those Matters which I look upon to be so Fundamental to true Christian Religion, if there was an occasion he should find me very Severe, but that is a large Field not to be entred upon at this time: The place wherein he chiefly foams out his Rage is Page 11. <hi>The Stander by may see us thrown, at their Will and Pleasure, into Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism, Arrianism, Anabaptism, Calvinism, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthism,</hi> or any other <hi>Hereticalism.</hi> Methinks <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianism</hi> might well have come in and made a Rhime with the rest; but he hath his Reason to the contrary, he must not bring in one of his Ancestors amongst He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, for <hi>Pelagius</hi> was <hi>Arminius</hi>'s Grand-father, for <hi>Arminians</hi> are <hi>Semi-pelagians,</hi> this is no place to speak of that Genealogy: <hi>Calvin</hi> he placeth amongst Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and makes his Opinions as abominable Heresies as <hi>Socinians,</hi> &amp;c. This Man who pretends to such a Tenderness for the Memory and Reputation of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40938:37"/>
Dead, doth here clearly shew us, how to say is one thing, and to do another; that eminent Instrument of Reformation from <hi>Popery,</hi> hath a name settled amongst all Reformed (except <hi>Arminian)</hi> Churches, beyond the reach of some Despicable Wretches in the World; 'tis well known how high a Value and Esteem, as might appear by several Instances, our first Reformers here had for him, but I want room for the present to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his Person and Doctrine; it may very well be said of him, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of another, <hi>The Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whose Praise is in the Gospel throughout all the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Churches.</hi> It cannot be said that he was <hi>Socinian, Arrian, Pelagian</hi> or <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> for he hath powerfully written against those Heresies: If he was an Heretick, seeing he will have him to be one, he must call him an <hi>Augustinian,</hi> for in Matters of Grace, none can deny but that he goes hand in hand with <hi>Austin</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this a pretty return of the Man to what I said, that some of our Church-men would, in my Opinion, do better, instead of being so Hot upon a Dispute about a Book whose it is, to write against <hi>Socinianism,</hi> which is riding in Triumphantly. I know a Worthy, and one of their chief Members, hath written some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well upon that subject, but another hath done it in such a way, being Ambitious to tread new Paths and be Singular, as hath started up Disputes between him and some Brother of his, who is, upon good reason, for keeping in the old way; I do not say that our Author should concern himself against <hi>Socinians,</hi> for what Affinity he may happen to have with them, I cannot tell, I am sure some of his <hi>Arminian</hi> Gang have; but in case he had not, he would not be proper for it, in that he hath no Convincing way; he answers Arguments only with ill Language, he would Rant and Hector, and if he could bring down Fire from Heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume whom he loveth not, we have a fresh Experience of it, and amongst other places in his P. 13.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40938:37"/>
As I perceive, this Man hath undertaken to be the Champion not only of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but also of that of <hi>Rome,</hi> for indeed in this very thing he takes up the Cudgels for them against all that are withdrawn from her Communion; and this is the Cause of all Protestant Reformed Churches: What is meant by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinism,</hi> I conceive it to be the Doctrine and Opinions of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and do not all Protestant Churches beyond Sea, except <hi>Lutherans,</hi> which have Transubstantiation and Ubiquity; nay, do not we our selves agree in the Doctrinal part with <hi>Calvin?</hi> Let us peruse the Body of the several Confessions of Faith of those For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Churches, and compare them with our Thirty nine Articles, as to the Doctrinal part, and we shall find they all agree in Doctrines of Faith: Is not this to bring in Popish Batteries amongst us, and plainly to betray the Protestant Cause? Is not this to help our Enemies and the Wicked?

What a Joy for Papists, both at home and abroad, to hear one in <hi>London</hi> hath in Print condemned for the worst of Hereticks all Churches that are withdrawn from that of <hi>Rome,</hi> Is it not a Shame to hear it? And will it not be a greater Shame to suffer it? It is very well worth the Pains of those that are concerned to look to it: The Laws do forbid all Commerce with the Romish Church, and 'tis Treason to be reconciled to it, or to Seduce others to do so, to write against that Churches Enemies is to write for it, to write for it, is to go about to Seduce People to be reconciled to it, which is Punishable by the Laws; this is too much to favour <hi>Rome:</hi> Did the greatest Stickler of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ever call our Holy Religion worse than <hi>Heresie;</hi> herein he justifies the more Violent <hi>Papists,</hi> amongst whom have been many, who in this case had more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and less Impudence than he; we call Heaven and Earth to record, and do Solemnly declare the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Cause to be herein Perfidiously betray'd.</p>
            <p>There are those in the World, who being so Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted as never to be willing to forgive them that really, or in their Opinion only, have offended them; when they say the Lord's Prayer, do leave out the fifth Petition, because they are not willing to forgive them that Trespass against them, though they would have God to forgive them their Trespasses; but our Blessed Saviour, in his Divine Wisdom, hath so twisted them, that they must go together: There is no Pardon for us, except we forgive others. Thus our Author, as we may reasonably believe, doth not joyn with the Church, though a pretended high Church-man, in that Prayer of the Common-Prayer-Book, wherein we Pray God <hi>to forgive our Persecutors and Slanderers;</hi> May be he will give the Reason why he doth not? That he hath not nor ever had, as to himself, occasion to use that Prayer, for he never was Persecuted or Slandered,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40938:38"/>
having always been, and desirous to be, on the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting and Slandering side. This Man I produce as a Witness to prove what I said of the Violence of the Spirit, and the Principles of some of them, and I think his Evidence speaks home, and what I also said of their Practise against Dissenters: In my weak Apprehension this Learned Pen had done better and a more Praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thing, to have written against <hi>Socinians,</hi> but them we do not mind, they are our Friends, and to make use of his words, herein we are in a Levitical Slug, but as soon as a Nonconformist's Book, exhorting to Union and Reformation, comes out, then Tooth and Nail against it, and would condemn it to the Fite.</p>
            <p>The long and the short of the Business is this, They are for Vengeance, we are told P 3. something we must <hi>expect from an Injured,</hi> or so thinking himself, <hi>Loyalist, and disturbed Privado:</hi> They are not for Peace or Reconciliation, as P. 13. <hi>Trespasses of the first Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude must not be forgotten, nor petty Injuries forgiven,</hi> P. 17. <hi>'Tis no Christian Logick,</hi> to say it were better to forget those things than to renew the Memory of them which continues Divisions; for, <hi>Their Gospel-Talents must not be wrapt up in an Idle Napkin of Silence and Oblivion, they must Preach and Evangelize the Jews</hi> (and <hi>Miscreants,</hi> and <hi>Exquisite Impostors,</hi> and <hi>Assassines,</hi> or such <hi>Furious Assailants as Presbyterians are,</hi> as they call us P. 33. and 43.) <hi>out of the Pale of the Christian Church,</hi> P. 19. Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks and Factious, <hi>ibid. We are for Clashing Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Church and State,</hi> P. 5. In short, We are Rogues, Murtherers, Enemies to the Government, infected with Seditious Doctrines, P. 23. And what else worse can be conceived of Men: He saith much, but proveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all; he hath learned the Maxim, <hi>Calumniare fortiter &amp; aliquid haerebit:</hi> Do but Slander boldly and something will stick: If he had given any Grounds, which he cannot, for such things, we would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40938:39"/>
to answer him; but our true and short an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to such Men is this, formerly made use of by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Mentiris impudentissimè,</hi> Thou art a most Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Lyar. In such a case, when Reason doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, these are the last Weapons to be made use of, we are for Peace, but when we speak they are for War. <note place="margin">Psal. 120. 7.</note>

            <p>Hereupon we have cause to make a Serious Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we are traduced for what we are not; they themselves declare they breath out after our Ruin and Destruction, and we cannot but see what we must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from them, if ever it was in their Power to Undo and Murther us; this is clear out of several places of the Pamphlet, <hi>If there be any Secular Care of the Scepter, if any Pious Regard for the Mitre, if there be any Security for their present Majesties,</hi> P. 3. Whence doth all this arise, and to what doth it tend? See Page 25. <hi>I am afraid,</hi> he would say, I hope, <hi>e're long they will both,</hi> that is, both divided Church-Parties, <hi>be upon the Bear,</hi> that is, the Dissenters. This is a Healing Spirit, a Hellish one rather, which is the Author of Jealousies, Divisions and Animosities; this threatning Noise would awake us if we were asleep, but <hi>latet anguis in herbâ:</hi> For what we know there is a Design to work Troubles, thereby to make way for a Beloved King <hi>James;</hi> they had rather Popery and Tyranny should come in, than that we should be at Peace and enjoy our Liberty; Quietness we are for, and they for War, for which I appeal, as before, to all their Sermons upon such days; nay, we must be <hi>a Sacrifice to Love and Loyalty, Honour and Honesty, Courage and Constancy,</hi> P. 4. Herein all is right, and nothing amiss: The Wise Man often speaks of a Fool, one of the Characters he gives of him is this, <hi>The way of a Fool is right in his own Eyes.</hi>

To speak such Language, is it not to move Sedition, to foment Division, to blow the Trumpet of Civil War, and to be a Firebrand? 'Tis indeed to have a Virulent Tongue; well hath the Spirit of God spoken of and described such a one, <hi>The Poison of Asps is under his</hi>

               <hi>Lips, his Mouth is full of Cursing and Bitterness, and the ways of Peace hath he not known.</hi> I am apt to believe, this Occasion about Anniversaries is but a Pretence to vent out Malice, for 'tis hardly possible for a Man to be so Idolizing and Doting upon the Ashes of one whom likely he never saw, and may be never heard much of, but by means of byassed Tongues and Pens: Observe him well, and it will easily be found out, how all this Zeal of his, hath for Object the Living more than the Dead; that all his Affections are concentered in one Male re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Family, and that there is a King <hi>James</hi> in the bottom; for one that hath but common Sence and Reason, may perceive, how most if not all these high-flown Church-men are <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and shelter their Hatred of the present Government under that Pretence. They now see, how of themselves they are not able to bring him back again, therefore they would, if they can, cause Disorders and put things in a Convulsion, that Confusion may accomplish their Ends, and they to Fish the better in Troubled Water: But we hope, from the Prudence of those that are concerned, they shall not carry the Point to the Prejudice of those who once were so cruelly used by the Means and Influences of that Abdicated King, that between him and them, there is necessarily an unreconcilable Enmity: So that upon the account of and in Conformity to their Hearty Affection and Interest, they will ever be ready with Lives and Fortunes, and whatsoever is Near and Dear unto them, to oppose the Popish Tyrannical Interest of that Man, and of all his Adherents, amongst whom, I think upon reasonable Grounds, we may reckon our

Author, who no doubt is not alone, but there be many more that are of his Principles, though many be not so as he seems to undertake for. Now I have done with him, and leave him to his Keeper.</p>
            <p>I once more declare my Grief, that I have sometimes been engaged to speak plainly; indeed hard words are quite out of my way, and contrary to my Nature, but Necessity and the Rack have extorted them from me: However the Party that brought it upon himself, may happen to be the better for it; and it may prove to be no Injury, to pull a Man by the Hair, to save him from the Fire or Drowning.</p>

               <q>Of the Divisions and Animosities we speak of, we have but a very late Instance in two Pamphlets lately published, <hi>viz. Some Observations upon the Thirtieth of</hi> January <hi>and Twenty ninth of</hi> May; and the answer to it under this Title of, <hi>The Reformer Rack'd,</hi> &amp;c. I shall not presume to enter into the Merits of the Cause, and whether such days ought to be kept <hi>in aeternum,</hi> the Publick Authority that ordered their Observance, is the best Judge of it: But I must confess that I cannot
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40938:40"/>
but be grieved to hear from the Pulpit on those days (generally speaking) nothing but Invectives, Railing Accusations and Abusive Language, instead of Christian Exhortations to Repentance, Union and Charity: I appeal to all the Sermons that have been published on that Subject—Such I may call the two Pamphlets I have but now mentioned, though I make a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them too: The Author of the former, though very much mistaken in several of his Notions, and especially in Church-Ceremonies, seems to be a good Man; but the Author of the latter, has broken all Bounds and Rules of Humanity with Mankind; and perhaps never was there in a Pamphlet so much Nonsence, and so much of Abusive Language, as in this; but what can be expected from a Man, who in his second Page looks upon <hi>Calvinism</hi> as an Heresie, as Damnable as <hi>Socinianism, Arrianism</hi> and <hi>Anabaptism?</hi> Such a Champion of our Church deserveth, I am sure, to be taken notice of some other way than by an Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
