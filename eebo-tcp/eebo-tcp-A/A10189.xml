            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If any of the comparisons therein specified, seeme odious, (as commonly most doe) to your holynesse, you must blame your selves, not me, who relate only your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (and compare them with the divells, the Iewish high Priests, Christs and his Apostles) but was not the author, nor occasion of them, And if you amend them and become new men, the Parallels will soone grow out of date: Neither doe I involve you all <hi>

therefore every of you, to apply so much of it (and no more) to himselfe as his owne conscience (upon serious examination) shall ascertaine him doth appertaine to him. Sure I am, that the whole concernes you all (as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited.) And the greater part, many of you (as divided) God grant you grace to make good use of it. It is the first degree of reformation, to discover your enormities to you; (This is my part, not yours; Loe I have here performed it.) The next degree is, to repent and amend all things amisse; and not to relapse; That is your part (by Gods concurring grace) I trust, you will speedily execute it; If not, As it was no rayling or slander in Christ, to call <hi>Iudas</hi> a divell <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 70. and to tell the Iewes that they wereof their Father the Divel <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8. 44. So it will be no reviling, or <hi>Scandalum magnatum in me,</hi> to say as much to your Lordships, If your actions prove you such; or to tell you, that you are none of Christs Disciples, Sonnes; or followers, but the divells; None of the Apostles successors, but the Iewish high Priests, really (though not morally) ceased in Christ, of whom they were a Tipe. Consider therefore seriously what is here written, and view your lives and actions in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall Glasse, and the Lord give you both understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reformation in all things amisse, (which now are many) that so you may be Christs and his Apostles followers and Disciples in verity, as you are now onely in pretence, (as is here in briefe discovered, I hope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence.</p>
            <p>Now least your Lordships should take any just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions against any thing I haue written: be it knowen to you, and all men, by these ptesents, that I am both able &amp; read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Dr. <hi>Barnes,</hi> our Learned Martyr, recites. That their was no great Clarke in the Church of God this 400. yeares, but he complained vehemently against the pride and lewde liuing of the Bishops. &amp;c.

And if they had not so great possessions, I am sure an hundred would speake against them, where now dare not one, for lofse of Promotion. As for this Article, I will overcomme you with the witnesse of all the world, you may well condemne it for herefie, but it is as true, as your <hi>Pater noster: Iudas</hi> sould our Master but once, and you sell him as often as he commeth in your hands. But I would it were, you could prove me a lyer, and that you followed any of the Apostles saving <hi>Iudas</hi> only. Yea, I would that you were in certaine points as good as <hi>Iudas</hi> was, &amp;c. Take it to you and make the best you can of it. Yea hee goeth one straine higher. <note n="(b)" place="margin">Page 284. 198.</note> I doe reckon (saith hee) of our English Lord Prelates your Lordships Predecessors) that you are ten times worse then the great Turke: for hee regardeth no more, but rule and dominion in this world? and you are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content, (and I shall say the same to you my Lords) but you will also rule over mens consciences,
<pb facs="tcp:21796:4"/>
yea and oppresse Christ and his holy word, and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme and condemne his word. They call themselues in words, the seruants of seruants; but in very deed, they will be Lord ouer all Lords, and desire to be taken as Lords and King ouer al Kings. These truths he sealed with his blood.</p>

               <hi>Iohn Frith</hi> our godly Martyr, writes thus: After that the office of a Bishop was made so honorable &amp; profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they that were worst both in learning &amp; living, most labored for it: For they that were vertuous would not intangle themselues with the vaine pride of this world. And in conclusion it came so farre, that whosoever would give most mony for it, or best could flatter the Prince (which he knew well all good men to abhor) had the preheminence and got the best Bishopricke: and then insteed of Gods word, they published their owne Commaundments, and made Lawes to haue all under them, and made men belieue they could not erre, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they did or said. And euen as in the roomes and steede of Moses, Aaron, Eliazer, Iosua, Calib, &amp; other faithfull folke, came Herode, Annas, Cayphas, Pilate and Iudas, which put Christ to death: So now in steede of Christ, Peter, Paul, Iames and Iohn, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full followers of Christ: we haue the Pope, Cardinals, Arch-Bishops, Bishops, and proude Prelates with their Proctours, the malicious Minister of their Maister the divell; which notwithanding transforme themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a likenesse, as though they were the Ministers of righteousnesse, whose end shall be according to their workes. So that the body is cankered long agoe, &amp; now are left but certaine small members which God of his puissant power, hath reserued vncorrupted: and because
<pb facs="tcp:21796:4"/>
they see that they cannot be ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kered as their owne flesh is, for pure anger they burne them, lest if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued there might seeme some deformity in there owne cankered carcasse, by the comparing of these whole members to their scabbed body. <hi>So he.</hi>

            <head>A notable Jesuiticall Policy of some Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prelates, worthy consideration.</head>
            <p>SOme great domineering Lord Prelates to advance their own power, and draw all men to their party, have of late endevoured to ingrosse into their hands, the disposall of most Ecclesiasticall dignities (as Bishopricks, Deanneres, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries, Headships in the Vniversities, presentations to most great Benefices, and the like) and of many temporall prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; together with the Custody of his Majesties Treasury. By this policy: First, they keepe all men from preferment (how deserving, learned and pioussoever) but those of their owne faction and creatures. Secondly, they make their owne party very great and strong in all Courts of Iustice, and places of the Realm, so as none dare oppose them in the least measure, no not in cases which highly concerne both GOD, the King, Religion, and the whole Realme. Thirdly, they are more feared and crowched to then the King himselfe, or all his Nobles. Fourthly, they would win all men to their own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, humours and superstitions, out of hopes of preferment, which else they have no way to attaine. Fiftly, they have many Clergie men so wholly at their command, that they will write, preach, practice, defend, any errours, false Doctrines, Innovations, Superstitions or popish Ceremonies, their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships shall command or desire them, to obtaine their favours and advancement. Sixtly, by this meanes they gaine scouts and spies in every corner of the Kingdome, in Court, City, Countrey, and in most Noble-mens, and Gentlemens families; (whose Chaplaines are now for the most part, nought else but these great Prelates agents and Intelligencers;) so that nothing can be done or spoken against them, or intended for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, but they have present information of it. Seventhly, by this policy, they keep all men under their girdles, crush all that dare oppose them, stop the current of Iustice; bolster
<pb facs="tcp:21796:10"/>
out all their popish agents and opposing officers, setup Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againe without much noyse or opposition, oppresse his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties good Subjects, extirpate piety and Religion, rob his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, his Nobles and officers of ther Authority, Privilidges and power to preferre well-deserving men, (and so by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, deprive them of much honour, service, respect, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and thankfulnes for benefits to be received;) advance their owne Episcopall power, jurisdiction, Cours, beyond all moderation and bounds, and in a manner do and say what they list without opposition or controule. This Iesuiticall strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem of theirs (prescribed by <hi>Conc</hi>' in his Politiques, as one of the chiefe meanes to undermine Religion, and all protestant States and Churches,) is worthy his Majesties and his Nobles most serious consideration, and prevention in due time; for feare it inslave them and the whole Kingdome to the Pope and Prelates, before they are aware of it.</p>
            <p>Great <hi>Reverend</hi> Lord Prelates are like to that we call a <hi>Sir Reverence;</hi> the more they stirre and are stirred, the worse, the more they stinke. They are like <hi>Davids mountaines,</hi> Ps. 144. 5. If men <hi>doe but touch them</hi> and their vices, <hi>they will smoke,</hi> yea storme and rage <hi>like the troubled Sea when it cannot rest, whose waterscast up mire and dirt,</hi> Isay. 56. 20. Hence they labour to suppresse, sease and call in all good Bookes, (yea the <hi>Palsgraves</hi> New-printed <hi>Declaration</hi> in affront to his <hi>Highnesse</hi> and <hi>his Churches,</hi> because it censures some of their idle Ceremonies and Arminian Doctrines, though tacitly and moderately by way of Apologie;) our Saviour himselfe gives us the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Why: Iohn 3. 20. <hi>For every one that doth evill hateth the light, neither commeth to the light, lest his</hi> deeds <hi>should be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and reprooved;</hi> as their Lord ships now are pretty well, if not to their amendment, yet doubtlesse to their shame.</p>

               <p>Such have Lordly domineering Pontificiall Bishops and Prelates in all ages beene, and that principally by reason of their Lordly functions, as the premises, all Stories and experience manifest.</p>

(who know not how to pray, or mak a conceived prayer out of their owne heades and hearts upon any occasion, no more then a child that is newly borne,) have cryed downe all extemporary conceived Prayers, (as well as studied Sermons and frequent preaching,) endevoring utterly to extinguish this most heavenly gift of Prayer, not only in all private Christians, but also in all those godly Ministers whom God hath endowed with this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent faculty, by confining them only to the very words of the <hi>Canon;</hi> which are no more a prayet then the Creed or ten Commandements, (which many ignorant people mumble over, as good prayers) and hath made many great Doctors unable for to pray without the helpe of a Common-prayer booke, upon any urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. For proofe whereof, I shall instance only in two late examples. When the <hi>Earle of Castle haven</hi> was to bee beheaded, there came two great learned Deanes &amp; Doctors of Divinity, to his lodging, to pray with him before his death. Where calling for <hi>A Common-Prayer Booke</hi> they read over the <hi>Letanie</hi> to him, (which was all the Prayers (they could make) and so concluded their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions. The Earle much grieved and discontented therewith, brake forth into these speeches. <hi>Alas, what doe these Doctors meane to trouble themselves, or mee, in praying to God, to deliver me,</hi> from lightning and tempest, from plague, pestilence and famine, from battle and murther, and from sudden death, <hi>who am now presently to die and lose my head? Or, what doth their praying,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all that travell by land or by water, all women la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring with child, all sicke persons and young children, &amp;c. <hi>concerne either me or my present condition, who am now ready to perish and bee destroyed?

they.</hi> This hee spake with teares in his eyes; and there upon desired the company there present with him to goe with him from these Deanes into another roome, where hee made such an heavenly fervent extemporary Prayer, pertinent to his present dying condition, as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished all the Auditours, and drew rivers of teares both from their eyes and hearts, which these non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praying Doctors Letany could not doe.

The Dr. <hi>Hereupon</hi> calls for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer-booke, and answer being madde that there was none present; he replied, that he could not pray without a Booke. Whereupon a Knight there present tooke him by the gowne, and forced him to kneele downe telling him, that my Lord was dying, and he must needes say some prayer or other; vpon this he begins <hi>Pater noster,</hi> for other prayer could he none: Which the Knight hearing, bads him hold his peace, for my Lord was dead, and he was but a dead Divine. Who knew not how to pray. Such woodden Doctors &amp; Prelates have we now adayes, that know not how to pray upon any sodaine occasion; because (like little children) they ever confine themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to a set forme of prayer, proceeding neither from their heads nor hearts but their lips only, which every Schoole-boy can read with as much devotion, as they.

Lord Prelates thinke not so, but deeme their owne Canons and Injunctions without his word, the only lawes whereby to governe and direct the Church.

Lord Prelates are not thus persecuted, imprisoned, scoffed at, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, but persecute, imprison, scoffe at, crucify, and burne others for Christs sake; and insteede of following Christs foot-steps in praying for their enemies, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, banne, curse, anathematize them to the very pit of Hell, with Bell Booke and Candle, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes offer this vnchristian violence to their very ashes, bones, and v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
