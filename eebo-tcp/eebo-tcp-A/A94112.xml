            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> Clauſe of that ſecond is, <hi>Whether their refuſall to diſ-band, or to remove farther off from</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>or obey the Parliaments preſent juſt Commands (upon what ever ſpecious printed pretexts) be not a very ſad publique preſident, likely to conjure up a ſpirit of Univerſall Diſobedience to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Magiſtrates, and ſuperiours of all ſorts throughout the Kingdome, to its utter ruine, if not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly prevented, diſliked, oppoſed by all well-wiſhers to the weal and tranquility of Church and State?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ethinks Sir, you ſhould have conſulted with your fellow-Advocates for defenſive Armes; who will Authorize (againſt the</hi> Oxonians) <hi>and legitimate ſuch an armed reſiſtance, of all deſtructive Commands, from any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours whatſoever; without all feare of overthrowing government or obedience; whom the Author of that ſeaſonable advice to the City of</hi> London <hi>ſeemeth to follow; confidently averring, that neither Fathers, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Kings, nor Parliaments, are to be obeyed if they command things unnaturall, impious, or unjuſt: Nay, that they are to be reſiſted, whenſoever they reach towards the ruine or bondage of thoſe who truſt them; and that he who aſſiſteth not to their ſuppreſſion, ſhall be guilty of ſiding with the murderous malefactours, &amp;c. If you ſay, he is a partiall Advocate for the Armies party, then I muſt tell you, by the pretty title, in probability, he is and hath been an able Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, and ſtudious Solicitor to the Parliament. But becauſe in favour of tyranny (as ſome ſay) you urge here the inconvenience of ſubverting all Authority, and hint ſo heavily upon a ſin, which our ſurly adverſaries (the Royall Doctors) do ſo ſadly damne from</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>that they doe privately conceit, and publikely proclaime, how that many of the Parliament ſide, muſt needs in trouble of ſpirit, wiſh that very Text expunged. Therefore for mine own and others ſatisfaction, I onely crave unto ſome</hi> Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res <hi>upon that Text, your punctuall reſolution; the onely Antidote to preſerve from error, and remove all doubt, as touching the chiefeſt thing in debate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether it enjoyne ſubjection active and paſſive, unto all manner of Magiſtrates, (though entring the office by fraud, treaſon, or tyrannous uſurpation, and exerciſing the ſame, by acting arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and ſetting forth Edicts, authorizing all injuſtice) or onely unto ſuch, as lawfully enter the office, and rightly exerciſe the ſame. If you maintaine the former, you avow the arrant flattery of <hi>Anaxarchus,</hi> (ſo much abominated by <hi>John Bodin.)</hi> If the latter, you comply with <hi>Thraſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> in <hi>Plato,</hi> viz. <hi>That a Magiſtrate cannot erre as a Magiſtrate;</hi> for in that he erreth, he digreſſeth from the rule of his office; in which exorbitancy, neither perſon nor action, can retaine any ſtamp of Power and Authority. Let us therefore ſee how you can by any reaſon divine, or humane, regulate, limit, or circumſcribe the Authority or Power of the Magiſtrate, and not by the ſame rule make him reſiſtable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How it may appeare from any part of Chriſts Teſtament, that ever he intended to have any ſort of perſons, (eſpecially in a meere Chriſtian ſociety) under any pretext whatſoever, in the exerciſe of injuſtice, rapine, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or tyranny, to be held ſacred and inviolable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Seing that all along <hi>Pauls</hi> time, the chiefe Magiſtrates (as Hiſtories manifeſt) have ſpared onely the baſe and bad, that they might have upon whom to exerciſe the burning ardour of Domination; and raged onely againſt the good and worthy, leaſt there ſhould be any that would or could reſiſt them. In what ſenſe could the Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, from the Magiſtrate praiſe and ſecurity to the pious, upon their uprightneſſe and well-doing?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Doth <hi>Paul</hi> here authorize error, falſhood, vice, and iniquity, (moſt often poſſeſſing the chaire of Authority) with power of definitive judgement over laws and perſons, and ſo to try ſentence, and puniſh truth, vertue, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, which are bound to ſubmit without verball or reall oppoſition, after the Apoſtolicall example of ſuch as were enabled thereunto by the Spirit powred out according to promiſe, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. And whether the ſheepiſh ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſuch, as wanting the ſame Spirit, will yet (from humor or heat of proceeding againſt the violence of power or impreſſion of danger) imitate thoſe ſupernaturall examples: tend not to the great encouragement of tyrants, whilſt their conſtancy is interpreted folly and obſtinacy, and their patience and ſilence after ſuch extraordnary patterns, is miſtaken, for the weakneſſe of an indefenſible cauſe?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether the Ordinance of our God (who is goodneſſe it ſelfe) can ever tend to the trouble, ruine, or affliction of his own children, when they are moſt obedient to his will?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whether the weakneſſe of our condition onely, doe abſolutely require that Law-givers, and Law-rulers, muſt be held in undoubted admiration; without which advantage no wit of man, can ever ſecure, order, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from ſubverſion?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Whether this Text doe not enjoyne more obedience to the Army in the upright proſecution of juſt and honeſt deſignes, then was ever due to the <hi>Caeſars</hi> in their vſurpation; or is now to the <hi>Othoman</hi> family in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Empire; or whether time and cuſtome onely, can legitimate violence and tyranny, and canonize the ſame for an Ordinance of Chriſt?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Whether you your ſelfe have not knowne this very Text, of late yeares to have been irreligiouſly wreſted, reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and taken up againe by all ſorts of time-ſerving Zealots, with a ſtrange impudence and unheedineſſe. If you pleaſe to ſatisfie my ſcruple in theſe particulars, I ſhall preſently pay all humble obedience unto the Parliament, and as freely reprove the Army without feare of their ſhot and powder.</p>
