            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Animadverſions ON King <hi>JAMES</hi> His LETTER to the POPE.</head>
            <p>LET Truth be never ſo evident, and Demonſtration ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo manifeſt, yet Infidelity will too often keep its Ground, and ſome invincible Perſuaſions will ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in that incorrigible Obſtinacy, that Right Reaſon ſhall have no ſway with them; and no proofs whatever ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince their Rooted Errours. To come to the particular Caſe in Relation to this Kingdom, perhaps 'tis not the leaſt part of our National ſhame that there are too many of us to this very Day will never be induced to miſ-conſtrue the leaſt Grain of the late King <hi>James</hi> his Integrity to his Honour and Engagements for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Proteſtant Religion; that at leaſt all the Meaſures ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before his Departure, that look'd a little too induſtrious for the propagation of the Romiſh Religion, they will allow to be no more than a pardonable Zeal in him; and that the Utmoſt of his Deſigns were no more than a favouring and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of his own Worſhip (a venial Frailty) in order to raiſe it above the Power of its profeſs'd Enemies; That his whole Ambition aim'd not at any farther Reach than to gain it an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Toleration and Impunity by reſcinding the Laws againſt it; and that no other <hi>Anguis in Herba,</hi> no Uſurpation againſt, or Subverſion of the Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſht, was ever meant or intended by him; his whole Endeavours being no more than to give Popery thoſe innocent Advances of Freedom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50985:3"/>
and Liberty, without the leaſt-intended Aſſumption of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſive or compulſive Power whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Nay, there are another ſort amongſt us, who though a little ſtagger'd at ſome irregular Court-Heats in the laſt Reign, and cannot deny but they are convinced ('tis true) that over-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by too many violent Zealots about him, he was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle miſ-led, and indeed was puſhing ſomething too far in ſome unjuſtifiable Favours towards his own Romiſh Cauſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if any ſuch Trips, or ſuch falſe Steps were then made, nevertheleſs their inviolable Deference, and Adherence to King <hi>James,</hi> inclining them to pardon ſmall Royal Faults, gives them at preſent ſo hearty a Good Wiſh for his Reſtoration to his Throne, as not in the leaſt to doubt, but his late Calamities befal'n him have moſt certainly quite changed his Reſolves; That the Miſeries he has underwent, and the too viſible Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of this Kingdom againſt all Invaſions of Popery, (if ever God Almighty bleſſes him by a Reſtoration) have and muſt paſt all Diſpute have broken all his old falſe Meaſures, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they might have been,) and that his late Wrack will for ever ſtand that warning Sea-mark, as never to venture again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like Danger, for fear of ſplitting again upon the ſame Rock; and conſequently there can be no farther occaſion of either fearing or ſuſpecting him; and therefore they perſwade themſelves 'tis their Duty to be aſſiſtant to their utmoſt power for his Return; and this, though the heartieſt Poteſtants, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſhadow of diſ-intereſting their own Religion, they are in all Conſcience obliged to do; and which, their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence aſſures them, they ſhall never repent when done; but ſtand confirm'd in a full and perfect ſecurity of the ſafety of their Religion and Liberties, from the accompliſhment of ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a Work as the re-mounting King <hi>James</hi> upon his Throne.</p>
            <p>Now as there are but too many poor deluded Zealots for K. <hi>James</hi> that are to this day either wilfully or (to ſpeak more favourably) unhappily blinded by theſe miſtaken Opinions, perhaps there
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50985:3"/>
never appear'd a more viſible Confutation of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Credulity in Favour towards him, then in his Letter to the <hi>Pope,</hi> annexed to, and Publiſh'd with the Tryals of the Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Aſhton, &amp;c.</hi> Upon which I ſhall make ſome few Remarks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the Authority and undeniable Truth of the Letter. <hi>It was found written in Latin, enter'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record in the Regiſter taken at</hi> Dublin, <hi>bearing Date,</hi> Dublin 26<hi>th. of</hi> November. 1689. <hi>With a Marginal Note recorded likewiſe in the ſame Regiſter:</hi> That the Original Letter was all writ by <hi>K. James</hi> his own Hand.</p>
            <p>Here before we enter upon the Letter it ſelf, 'tis to be obſerved what affectation of Glory, what Triumph there is in a <hi>Romiſh Bigot,</hi> a true Son of Mother Church, in the leaſt Atchievement for, or promotion of Her Darling Cauſe.</p>
            <p>'Twas not enough belike, that ſuch a Letter was written in Latin (the uſual Language of Addreſſes to the <hi>Pope)</hi> and no wonder, to gain it ampler Credence, and give it the fairer ſtamp of Authority, all Original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writ by K. <hi>James</hi> his own hand; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (one would think) it had done its whole Work, by being ſent to, and received by the <hi>Pope.</hi> But at the ſame time, this Zealous piece of Romiſh Service in King <hi>James,</hi> to His Fames Eternal Monument, muſt be afterwards Enter'd and Regiſter'd upon Record, on purpoſe to be tranſmitted to Poſterity, with that particular Juſtice done him of a peculiar Marginal Note, <hi>that it was all writ with his own hand.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Here we ſee the firſt part is His joyful Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His Holineſs's Promotion to the ſacred Chair, which, though at firſt reading, may appear no more than a cuſtomary Complement, as being dated 26<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November.</hi> 89. and thereby written juſt upon the <hi>Popes</hi> Acceſſion to the Papacy. However, as the whole Outcry of the Romiſh Party, at the <hi>Pope</hi>'s firſt Inſtauration, roar'd high, and bellowed loud, with a confident aſſurance of a <hi>Frenchified Pope,</hi> to no leſs than almoſt a publick Abjuration of the little leſs than Heretical <hi>Pope Innocent,</hi> his dead Predeceſſor, the Papiſts themſelves (the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> ones at leaſt) reſolved if poſſible, even to Abdicate his hated Memory. Upon this univerſal Preſumption of the then new <hi>Popes</hi> Affections, undoubtedly the tranſported K. <hi>James</hi> felt ſome part of their common Titillation; and this Careſs to his New-made Holineſs, bore ſomething of more than ordinary Patheticks in it, to ſo hopeful and promiſing an Apoſtolick Succeſſor. And the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Fatherly Love, and tender Compaſſion of

King <hi>James</hi> his ſufferings expreſs'd in the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to King <hi>James,</hi> under the aforementioned Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His Holineſs's Inclinations, unqueſtionably brought him the real conſolation the Letter deſcribes.</p>

                  <p>—The only ſource of all theſe Rebellions againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s is, That We embraced the Catholick Faith; and do not diſown, but that to ſpread the ſame, not only in Our Three Kingdoms, but over all the diſperſed Colonies of Our Subjects in <hi>America,</hi> was Our Determination.—</p>

            </p>
            <p>The only Source of theſe Rehellions againſt him (he ſays) is that he embraced the Catholick Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That I am afraid is a notorious Miſtake; for his embracing the Romiſh [Catholick] (as he calls it) Faith, was ſo far from raiſing any thing like Rebellion againſt him; that not withſtanding the Nations Conviction of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereing to that Perſwaſion before his Acceſſion to the Crown, not only the throwing out of the Excluſion Bill, that ſo ſtrenuouſly aſſerted his Right, and open'd his Acceſs to the Throne; <hi>but likewiſe the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Fealty, and indeed even Paſſionate tenderneſs towards him at his Acceſs to the Throne,</hi> notwithſtanding his publiſh'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; ſufficiently demonſtrate that a Rebellion againſt him, was fartheſt from the Principles or thoughts of his truely Loyal and Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
            <p>Indeed, when he plainly declares, and which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too plainly ſaw, after he once grew warm in the Imperial Seat, he reſolved and determined to ſpread his Religion, not only through his three Kingdoms, but likewiſe through his Territories in the <hi>American</hi> World

too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> poſſibly a little abatement of that firſt, Heat and Love towards him might leſſen our fond Affections, at leaſt in that part of Mankind, that could in Conſcience do no leſs than have ſome reaſonable Reluctance againſt the notorious Violation of what ought to be moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, the repeated Vows and Proteſtations (the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Coronation Oath not excepted) of his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was never intended; together with ſome ſmall Concern for a Religion and Liberty ſo near and ſo dear to them, at that time under ſuch undeniable Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of being undermined and ſupplanted.</p>
            <p>But as great an abhorrence as all good People had of ſuch ſiniſter Deſigns ſo apparently carried on againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rights and Liberties, and as much as it might cool their Zeal for King <hi>James;</hi> how unjuſtly we are charged with Rebellion againſt him, in any part of this happy Revolution, has been already proved by larger and more learned Diſcourſes on that Theam.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To manifeſt his Determination of eſtabliſhing Popery in that Kingdom, he might have pleaded a great deal further back for his Proofs then his <hi>late</hi> proceedings there; for from the very beginning of his Reign, the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50985:5"/>
Meaſures taken in that Kingdom, have been ſo barefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as every Eye might ſee into; the barbarous turning out of all Proteſtants there from all Truſt either Civil or Military, even to caſhiering every private Heretick Sentinel, ſpeaks but too plain. Barbarous, I may very well call it, when with ſo much horrid and ſhameful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and Rapine the Proteſtants were diſpoſſeſt of all Command and Truſt, (for what end is too plain) though their very Places were <hi>bought,</hi> and by the Government allowed to be ſo, without the leaſt reſtitution or ſatifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction whatever made them: And the ſame Seizure that thought their Commands and Places lawful Prize, brought the Heretical Money that paid for 'em under the ſame Condemnation.</p>
            <p>I am afraid his <hi>frequently beating the Rebels in ſmall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; his aſſurance of his compleater Victory, if offer'd Battel,</hi> were only a Temporary confidence in him; the ſaid Aſſurance not always continuing; witneſs the planting of Horſes before hand, and his early, if not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſty poſting Sea-ward before the Battel of the <hi>Boyne.</hi>

               <hi>Remark.</hi> Here the Bolt's ſtruck home; 'Tis not his loſs of Three Kingdoms, not all his at preſent defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deſigns, with all their attending Calamities, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing to no other Original, if once ſo bleſt as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount his Throne, ſhall deter him from taking up the

Old broken Cudgels, and venturing a ſecond wreſtle though for a ſecond Fall in ſo meritorious a Cauſe. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronement, Abdication, nothing ſhall bar the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his Fidelity to that (I dare not ſay,) only ſworn, but at leaſt only binding Oath, the Romiſh Reſtoration. And truly, not to enlarge upon this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick, he has not only been always too firm a <hi>Devote</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> but under his preſent Obligations to that Prince, (if poſſibly, (as Heaven forbid,) reſtor'd to theſe Kingdoms,) ſo much a Dependant on that Monarch that beſides his natural Propenſity of not eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Injuries, and conſequently not being over tender of laſhing the Backs of a Rebellious, (as he calls 'em,) Heretick Nation; yet even ſuppoſing a more then Popiſh Miracle, his Abjuration of all forgotten Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt them, a Beam of Mercy we muſt hardly look for, even in ſpight of himſelf, his Tenure under <hi>France,</hi> his Royal Lieutenancy to the Great <hi>Louis,</hi> (the higheſt Poſt he can hope for,) as the ſad Sufferings of the poor inoffenſive Hereticks on the other ſide the <hi>Herring-pond</hi> point to us, will tye him up to no extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Clemency to the more Capital ones on this ſide.</p>
            <p>The latter part, <hi>viz.</hi> the Peoples uneaſie bearing of the Uſurpers Yoke, (as he calls him,) and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſallity of their longings for his own Return; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps upon due Examination, whatever his Intelligence has been of their Inclinations, poſſibly is not the firſt Miſtake that poor Prince has been flatter'd into.</p>

               <hi>Remark.</hi> This Paragraph puſhes the Romiſh Zeal a little further than the concern of his own Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and his <hi>American</hi> Colonies; the poor Indulgence of the Reform'd Religion, is an Eye-ſore to him all the World over; and he cannot forbear his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Devotion even beyond his own Dominions, for rooting (as his own Secretary <hi>Coleman</hi> told us,) the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent <hi>Northern Hereſy</hi> from the Face of the Earth, as gnawing, to his no ſmall Anguiſh, in the very Bowels of the Church.</p>

               <hi>Remark.</hi> Thus ends this promiſing and imploring Epiſtle to the Pope. What ready Performances he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages on his own part for the Romiſh Cauſe, We have but too much Reaſon to believe, were, and are heartily intended; and will undoubtedly, if Power be ever equal to good Will, be as heartily put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

on this work, 'tis thought has not been ſo zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lent as deſired; the Princes of the Empire, tho' of his own Faith, nay the Pope himſelf, eſpecially <hi>Innocent</hi> his Predeceſſor, not thinking it worth their while to uſe their Mediation with their Catholick Sons, either for patching up a Peace or a Truce with <hi>France,</hi> after ſuch impardonable Injuries receiv'd by them from that common Diſturber of <hi>Europe,</hi> on ſo poor an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as the Re-eſtabliſhing of a Prince ſo mixt and link'd in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſts, as he has ſcarce room left for their Pity; nor is it the meaneſt Jewel in the Crown of our Great and truly Proteſtant Defender of the Faith, the Glorious King <hi>William,</hi> to be the ſelected Darling of Mankind, to ſit Preſident of the Great Council of <hi>Europe,</hi> choſen by thoſe Princes of a contrary Perſuaſion to be their Leading Worthy.</p>
