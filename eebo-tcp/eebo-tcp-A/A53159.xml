            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Strange and Wonderful News <hi>FROM</hi> St. <hi>John</hi>'s Street.</head>
            <p>THe Judicious Reader has been so often imposed upon in this pamphletting Age, that 'tis no wonder he should sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the truth of a Reality, after he has been fool'd by so many fictions. But in this insuing Relation, I have taken so much pains to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit nothing but Verity, that I laid by as sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious the reports of my dearest Freinds, till I had purchased my own satisfaction, with go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be an eye witness of what without a blush from the Testimony of my own sense, I dare as a certain truth to all the world bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Relate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:30946:3"/>
The General Report of a Monstrous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which was lately produced in St. <hi>Iohn's Street,</hi> Beckoned my curiosity thither, where from one Mrs. <hi>Denman,</hi> at the <hi>White Hart,</hi> a Victualling House in that same street, I had this ensuing Relation.</p>
            <p>That about a week since (it being part of her lively-hood to keep <hi>Hoggs,)</hi> it happened that she had a <hi>Sow</hi> brought forth seaven live well shap'd Piggs, which at that time she thought were all that the Sow then went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; but about half an hour after their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, to her great Amazement, she beheld her deliver'd (in a bagg by it self) of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Monstrous Creature, which upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, she openly exposed to my view.</p>
            <p>The Skin of it instead of being shaded (as is usual) with Infant bristles, was like an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, soft and smooth, and not so much as Cover'd with a hairy Down. Its Body somewhat resembles that of a common Swine, but its hoofs were so Monstrous that liberal nature in all her variety will not admit them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30946:3"/>
a similitude: They some what resembled a <hi>Goats,</hi> but turn up at the ends not much alike that Horses, which as a wonder, was frequently shown at <hi>Moor Gate.</hi> About the Virilities it is so ambigously compacted that it would have puzled the curious inspection of the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive Anatomist to deside its Sex, but the Deformities of its Body were beauties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Monstrosity of its head: The Ears more resembling those of Dogs, than Swines, hung backwards and pointed towards the Nape of the Neck; but the forehead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broad towards the Crown, Lessened down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and look'd as if Nature in her formation had been at a <hi>Nonplus,</hi> and was forc'd to patch up a shape equally resembling both Man and Monkey.</p>
            <p>The deformity of its face is able to put an Atheist in mind of the primitive Chaos when all things lay blended in confusion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had not yet lick't them into form, instead of eyes you might have seen the plain blank of a whole Skin, which look'd as if
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30946:4"/>
Oblivious Nature had forgot to Chalk out the Eye-holes, which in lew of those glittering luminaries (which recommend to our appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation the displeasing irrigularities of most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals) were supply'd by a pair of sinewy Bunches stuft up with a grisly substance, and strutting out like a threatning Promontory, seem'd to over-look the horrid deformities of its imperfect <hi>Nose,</hi> which upwards near the forehead, was plain'd even with the face, and at the Root where that member Joyns to the forehead, was seperated by a certain <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi> through which one might almost discover its brains. The cheeks bear no ill comparison with those of Humane Creatures, being like theirs, plentifully adorn'd or streakt with a pleasant mixture of Red and white, which would make the wondring spectator grieve to see so many perfections coupled to a Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish snout, which notwithstanding is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly shapt like those of that species, but seems rather to resemble the Trunk of an <hi>Elephant,</hi> turning round at the end till it almost makes a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30946:4"/>
Ring at the end of the face. It has but one No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stril which by its excessive wideth promises to be as officious to Nature as others too.</p>
            <p>The surprising horror of its Clubbing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities at first sight posesses the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring spectators with a Certain dread not much unlike the ungrateful salutation of a naked Corps; and indeed methinks it would be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the most curious Inspection of the most accomplish't <hi>Naturalist,</hi> who with no small wonder, would there behold humanity and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suallity so artificially blended, that he would be put to no small pain upon, the consideration of their mutual concurrence to give the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a name. He who looks upon its Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the judgment of an <hi>Adam,</hi> might readily call it a beast; but should he go further, and deliberately behold the woundrous compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of its startling <hi>Phiznomy,</hi> I question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would not repent the Temerity of his verdict and recal the sentence. To behold wrapt up in the careless swadling-cloath of a clean Napkin, a Creature about the bigness of a Child</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:30946:5"/>
the fore part of the head representing in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy those Reverend <hi>Skulls</hi> which Age hath rob'd of hair, and cruel time clos'd up their use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Ey-lids. I assure thee Reader, if thou hast not a dauntless courage indeed, it will surpize thee with unusual dread, when thou shalt look in its face, and behold perfect Eye brows mourning they have no Eyes to defend, struting) Cheeks shaking hands over the depressed bridgs of an Apish nose, a forehead which by the least contraction of its dilicate skin, exactly immitates a humane frown. In short, when thou hast glutted thy Curiosity in beholding Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strosity in t<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>my, thou wilt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thy Pilgrimage to St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Street,</hi> but return home thronged with admiration at the promiscuous productions of Nature.</p>
