         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the Deſignes of this Age do tend, as I am verily perſwaded, to a thorough Reformation; yet hitherto we cannot ſee much more then the Overthrow and Deformation of former Eſtabliſhments: partly, becauſe there is much rubbiſh to be removed; partly, becauſe it is not
<pb facs="tcp:61230:3"/>
poſſible to build a new Houſe where an old one is ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till the old one be pulled down. Yet no wiſe man will lay his old habitation waſte, till he know what to erect inſtead thereof: Hence it is, that a New Modell is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firſt prepared before the old one be removed. I know not how far this Courſe hath been taken by others, but in the Sphere wherein I have walked, my Aime hath been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take away the Difficulties then to lay them open, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuggeſt a Remedie then to diſcourſe of the Diſeaſe; for there is no end of Complaints on all hands, ſeeing each Party doth lay open the others faults; and few or none tell us, how they ought to be mended. For indeed it is eaſier to ſee a mote or a web in another mans eye, then to take it out, and moſt men think themſelves juſtified, when they have condemned others, whoſe way is different from that which they have Choſen. And although this ſeems to be in all other matters the Ordinary Practice; yet in the Wayes of Education, and the Reformation of Schools (the deepeſt foundation of all other good Settlement both in Church and Common-wealth) it hath not been followed hitherto. But my honoured Friend Mr. <hi>John Amos Comenius,</hi> and ſome other Fellow-labourers and Correſpondents in this Work with my ſelf, have ſtudied to make as little Alteration
<pb facs="tcp:61230:3"/>
as could be, ſeeking onely the beſt Advantages which upon the Ordinary Foundations of School-teaching could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced: and in this Endeavour for a great many years we have Continued, and many wayes attempts have been made to facilitate the Courſe of Univerſall Learning, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the teaching of Learned Tongues; and to abridge the time which is ſpent, and to eaſe the toil which is taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: but when all is done, we finde after long experience, that it will be impoſſible to raiſe a Firme and Commodious Building upon the Old Foundation; for which Cauſe I muſt needs ſhew now the weakneſſe and defaults thereof. And becauſe it is no ſmall difficultie and hazard to venture upon the contradicting of a Cuſtome ſo Univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as is the Grammatical Tyranny of teaching Tongues; Therefore I am willing to make an Appeal, and ſeek out an Eminent Patron for this bold Attempt, not doubting that Your Impartiall Judgement, not wedded to things, becauſe they are Cuſtomary and received, will look into this thing with a more ſingle eye, to diſcern the truth of that which is offered, then others can do, that are either ſo far engaged unto the Road-way, that they will not think of any better
<pb facs="tcp:61230:4"/>
Courſe to be taken; or ſuſpect all New Deſignes as light Projects of unſetled braines: but I hope Your Solid Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and large Experience of my conſtant behaviour will abſolve me from the guilt of Levity, in proſecuting all the Wayes whereby Learning may be advanced. Seeing it hath been a great part of my Study above theſe twenty years; nor have I been alone in this Work, but many others of great Worth and Abilities, have been obliged to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute their help unto me. Nor is it the Scope of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe (wherein others ſpeak more then I) ſo much to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw what is in uſe, as to introduce a Better, Eaſier, and Readier Way of Teaching: But how to Introduce the Way which is here intimated into the Publique Schools of this Common-wealth, will be a matter of further delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then is fit for me now to enter upon; it may be hoped, that the Honourable Committee for the Advancement of Learning, will be inclined to reflect upon this matter, and conſider the feaſableneſſe thereof: and haply ſomething as a Propoſall in this Kinde may be offered unto them; wherein Your Grave Recommendation to ſet their thoughts a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may have a ſpecial influence in due time; Therefore, leſt I

Therefore he, voluntarily laies himſelfe open to be exploded with their hiſſes, or torne with their bites, or ſtabb'd with their writings, whoſoever in this Scholaſtical Common-wealth doth never ſo little remove their Statutes, or hath not their Edicts and Ordinances in ſacred eſteem.

And whoſe wholeſome and rare Inventions touching this matter, although I do not diſallow, nor remain ignorant thereof, in that I have conferred at large about this thing already, two years ago with one of the chief of them, my old friend, and a very excellent man at <hi>Franckford</hi> at the <hi>Main;</hi> and then alſo laid open to him my intent of ſetting out theſe things; yet I divulge here none of thoſe buſineſſes which were invented by him, and I hitherto not publiſhed, but leave them ſafe and ſound to their Authour. And here onely put forth thoſe things which have already afore-hand been deviſed by me, touching the ſame, which, if they may ſometimes chance to be compared together with the Inventions of others, it will not be haply unprofitable. For whether they agree with them, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent will be beneficiall; or whether they diſagree, their comparing may
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61230:7"/>
be of uſe. And which things, ſuch as they are, both learned men will judge, and Reaſon, being Umpire, will ſhew; and Experience, which I principally wiſh, being the diſcoverer, will declare. There are Two things, which it ſtands me in hand to demonſtrate, being about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my Counſel or Advice touching the learning of the Latine Tongue. The firſt is, that that common Way of learning the Latine Tongue, which is hitherto uſed in Schools, is clogged with much labour, weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe, and difficulty. The other is, that another plainer, readier, and ſhorter Way for the leading to the Latine Tongue, may not onely be made; but that we ſhould alſo enquire, explain, and ſhew what that is, or peradventure may be. Now whether this way be found out by me, Learned men will judge, and Experience it ſelf, which I do wiſh, will deſcry. Surely, if I ſhould affirm that I have not been the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt amongſt them, who have ſought or enquried for it, I ſhould not lie. My endevours upon <hi>Plautus,</hi> the Prince of the Latine Tongue, will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which I aſſayed now twenty years ago to tranſlate into our own native Germane, or Dutch language, that it might anſwer word for word, the Germane or High Dutch put under the Latine, a in this Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Teſtament: And a Grammatical Book, into which are heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together all the words of all the Latine tongue, being brought into their ranks, and fitted to their precepts and rules: And a Book which I have entituled, <hi>A Key to the Greek Tongue,</hi> and my Paraphraſes of the three Satyriſts, wherein I have inſerted the Poets words; which very thing likewiſe I have endeavoured in the Paraphraſe of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with certain other things, which as yet lie hid at my houſe among my papers or Note-books; In which ſurely, if I have not found<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have ſurely ſought certain ſhort Cuts, or advantageous Courſes for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of many and great difficulties. For now a long time, and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years this thought hath come into my minde, and buſied, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me, what ſhould be the Reaſon, that when all other Tongues, even thoſe, which not onely have nothing common with our German Speech, as the Spaniſh and Italian; but thoſe alſo in whoſe pronunciation we, Germanes, finde by experience the greateſt hardſhip, as be the Polonian and the French, may in ſome reaſonable ſort be learned by many Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans in two, or to be ſure, in three years ſpace, yea, out of <hi>Spain, Italy, France, Poloniae,</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> it ſelf, in the Schools even of private Maſters: Onely theſe Three Tongues, Latine, Greek, and Hebrew, in which the holy Scripture, and Humane Learning, Faculties, Arts and Sciences are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61230:8"/>
either extant in writing, or are taught and learned by Interpreters, are learned in ſo long a ſpace of lifes time, and with ſuch miſerable paines both to the Teacher and Learner that ſome there are, who being ſpent and wearied out with the tediouſneſſe and impatience of ſo wretched a teaching, do begin to hate and forſake the ſtudy of Learning: others, who perſevere, can hardly be brought thither before they be eighteen, or even twenty years of age, ſo as they can ſcantly at laſt with much ado ſobbingly and ſtammeringly utter a few Latine words, who the mean time ſcarce ſo much as ſlightly touch the Greek or Hebrew Tongues. And which thing is to be the more admired, and hath ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me no other then monſtrous, inaſmuch as I am verily perſwaded of this, (and whereof neither any that is well in his wits, I think, will ever make doubt) that theſe three Tongues have nothing peculiar and proper over other Tongues, whereby they cannot be learned as well as others, by Uſe, Cuſtome, and Exerciſe. Yea, which formerly Infants and Children learned; the Romanes or Latines, the Romane or Latine; the Greeks, the Greek; the Hebrews, the Hebrew, to whom theſe Tongues were proper and naturall, together with the milk of their Mother or Nurſe from their Mothers, Nurſes, Keepers that bare them about, School-maſters, and ſuch as liv'd in their houſes, by Uſe and Cuſtome, juſt as our Infants and Children do learn their Mother, own-Countrey Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tongue. Which three Tongues alſo others, to whom they were not Countreyly-peculiar, could long ſince learn by Cuſtome and Uſe in two years, certainly, that we may allow them ſo much time, as may be enough and too much in three years ſpace. For the Romanes or Latines learned the Greek Tongue at <hi>Athens;</hi> and the Greeks, the Latine at <hi>Rome;</hi> and both theſe Greeks and Romanes, the Hebrew Tongue among the Jews in <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> as the Jews on the other part learned in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> the Greek or Latine Tongue by Uſe and Cuſtome, which very thing whoſoever ſhall conſider with me more accurately, he cannot doubtleſſe chuſe but grant that ſome Means and Way may be found out, whereby theſe Three Tongues, as formerly they could be learned by Uſe, and Cuſtome in a ſhorter ſpace of time, even as other Tongues are learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo they may yet be learned. Now touching the vulgar Way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing Children in Schools, though even I my ſelf have ſometime, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a young Scholar at School, undergone it, and growen further into years have diſcharged it, being appointed a School-maſter and Tutor for the teaching of the younger ſort, (indeed not without both very great irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61230:8"/>
ſomneſſe of life and loſſe of time) to ſpeak what I think, yea, as the matter is, being indifferent what ever others are ready to think or ſpeak to the contrary, it ſeems to me to be ſuch, and ſo introduced into Schools, juſt as if one out of hired pains and ſtudy had been commanded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe ſome Mean or way, whereby Maſters and Scholars too, might bring, and be brought on to the knowledge of the Latine Tongue not without huge labours, great wearineſs, infinite toils; and finally, not without a very long interval and ſpace of time.

            <p>In the firſt place the precepts of Grammar are ſo many times in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner increaſed, ſo oft changed, as often as a new Moderatour is put in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for the School, and who except he brings ſomething that is new, or at leaſt alter the old, he may ſeem perhaps the leſs learned to himſelf in his own judgement. Certainly as oft as a youth goes away from one School to another, ſo often is his old Grammar to be unlearned, and a new one to be learned. By which things the tender mindes of the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort are not onely hindered and troubled, but alſo that Golden age is both worn out and tormented. And I pray you what end and meaſure is there of theſe kinde of Rules or Precepts? when as there are now eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where found more Grammatical Books in Schools, then there are Schools themſelves well neer or upon the matter, foraſmuch as they are oftentimes changed in one School. And when all is done, what elſe is this Grammatical teaching, but a ſtoppage and let to ſtudies, but a waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpoiler of childiſh, yea, of youthful age, but a hanging, like torture of an ingenuous minde or diſpoſition, but laſtly, a driver away of the beſt wits out of Schools? and whereon hitherto, to the unvaluable and irrecoverable hurt and damage of mans whole life, which is ſo ſhort and ſo fleeting, is beſtowed all that ſpace of child-hood, ſtripling-age, yea truly in many, even of their youthful eſtate to the 20th. year &amp; upwards, That moſt pleaſant Spring of a mans whole life, and whoſe untouched flowers, and tendereſt roſes theſe moſt crabbed, and to ingenuous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mindes moſt unpleaſing and formidable petty precepts of Grammar do crop and pluck off, and whereof anon there is no more uſe: which a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61230:9"/>
little after are no more to be practiſed or mentioned, but to be left off and committed to oblivion. And yet in learning which, yea, in learning them by heart, and preſently in unlearning them ſo many years hath been beſtowed and ſet over upon their accompt; as with which they might have learned theſe three Tongues, and have been brought on to the Principles and Foundations of Arts, and Faculties. Which things whilſt I have often weighed and conſidered, I have been moved, I confeſs more then once to think, and perſwade my ſelf verily they were brought into Schools at firſt from ſome evill and envious <hi>Genius,</hi> being an enemy to Mankinde, by the means of certain unlucky Monkes. There is moreover another calamity not much inferiour to the former: Scholars ought to love their Maſters as their own Parents; foraſmuch as even they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are Parents, not of bodies, but of mindes. Now theſe for the moſt part they hate and fear, yea oftentimes they dread and tremble at as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and their tormenting Executioners, being formidable for their rods and laſhes, or jerks. All this miſchief is due well nigh to the inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Grammatical precepts. Which according to this vulgar way of teaching Children in Schools, are wholly to be inculcated into boyes, nor can they be inculcated, or put into their heads, but by blowes and ſtripes; becauſe of what things Childrens age is not yet capable, thoſe things is naturally refuſeth and diſdaines. Now what and how great a calamity of Maſters, and likewiſe of Scholars is this? the moſt boyes hate Schools, as houſes of Correction, ſcourging places, or meer whipping poſts, and ſcarce ever come at them of their own accord, where this teaching of Children is uſed as a medicine of mindes to unwilling and forced Scholars by their Maſters whom they fly and hatefully abhor. A ſick perſon is ſcarce ever reſtored to his health by a Phyſician whom he hates; confidence indeed of the ones good will towards the other can only do this. Now this is ſometimes wholly baniſhed out of Schools, both by the Teachers and the Learners, through that common teaching, whereby the Grammar is inculcated, which cannot chuſe but make Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters themſelves auſtere, harſh and erabbed, while they are enjoyned to do that, by which violence is offered to boyiſh age, and that which is contrary, bad and hurtfull to nature. For boyes are bid to apprehend thoſe things, whereof that age is not yet capable; and are commanded to learn thoſe things without book,

            <p>Whoſe uſe is ſhewn to them very ſlowly and ſparingly, ſcarce in a moſt long ſpace of time in thoſe few Examples. And to which Precepts Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſo oblige and binde their Scholars and themſelves; as if it were a thing impoſſible, that they ſhould know and be able to ſpeak ought in Latine, except it be alſo added according to what Precepts of Grammar, or Rules of <hi>Syntax,</hi> that may be ſo ſpoken aright according to Art. Whereupon it often happens that even Maſters themſelves cannot ſpeak readily. He ſhall never ſpeak promptly, and with expedition, or quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who hath tied and fettered himſelf with theſe Rules of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar. I have ſometime laught at a dancing boy at <hi>Collen,</hi> who from a continuall Exerciſe of dancing had got him a kinde of habit, and from thence would now and then unawares as he was walking ſeriouſly in the ſtreets, begin to dance; for as he treading daily according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and orders of dancings had contracted this to himſelf; ſo theſe while they are bound onely to the Rules and Lawes of Grammar, nor handle almoſt any thing elſe then Rules or Precepts, and are more exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the Precepts of Art, then in the Uſe and Examples of Precepts, they themſelves will ſcarce ever learn to ſpeak readily or teach others. I could ſhew this by memorable Examples, were they not over-odious and too unworthy to be well brought to this place. To ſpeak onely of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I ſaw a gentile youth of a brave towardlineſſe, already ſeventeen years old, or more, for the trying of whoſe proficiency and benefiting in ſtudies I my ſelf with ſome others was made uſe of. He under his Maſter had learned exactly at the fingers end the Precepts or Rules of Grammar, together with the Examples which were added to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, but he could not rehearſe them otherwiſe then Parats, <hi>illud ſuum</hi>

               </gap>, that all hail, God ſave you, or forme of ſalutation of theirs, or then Pies or Crowes recite mens words. For he knew neither the Uſe of Rules nor Examples, but committed all things to memory at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Maſter, as if it were enough to learn the Latine Tongue, to repeat the Rules of Grammar which thou doeſt not underſtand, or of whoſe uſe thou art ignorant; for ſcarce could he combine or put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three or four Latine words ſtumblingly or ſtutteringly, as if he were troubled with the hichet or yexing. Who will ever make queſtion that he might, in that golden time, wherein lie wore out the flower of his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61230:10"/>
youthfull age in thoſe unhappy and unprofitable Precepts, have been able to have learned three or four Tongues, if he had uſed due Meanes to that End, and had had right teaching? Maſters in teaching theſe Rules, and Scholars in learning do in the Schools moſt miſerably tire and vex themſelves lean with labours, weariſomneſſes, and toilſome cares more heavie then death; and with which, as Hiſtories tell us, <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius</hi> the Sicilian Tyrant was very well puniſhed at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where, when he was deprived of his Kingdome, he ſet up a Grammar-School; and from whence the Satyriſt not without great reaſon exclaimes,

Which very thing proceeds from this occaſion chiefly, becauſe by ſo laborious, and (to ſay the truth) ſo prepoſterous a teaching through the inculcating of Grammar-rules, Maſters profit ſo little in ſo long a time by teaching, and Scholars by learning.

Edict, that there ſhould not a jot of them be changed, and that theſe Rules or Precepts ſhould be commonly propounded in all Schools, nevertheleſſe could I hereby think that the teaching of Children were provided for ſufficiently. Becauſe that theſe Rules even, whatever they may come to at length, do not ſuit with Childrens age. For this is in all teaching to be regarded above all things, that the teaching of them who are to be taught, be fitted to their capacity; and from the unobſerving whereof, all this miſchief in Schools hitherto ſeems to have been bred and ſprung up. Now what, and how monſtrous an abſurdity is it, to propound thoſe things to childiſh age, for the perceiving whereof it is not yet capable? and to require of Children, that they accomodate or apply words of Art to the termes and names of Things, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to Children <hi>Entia Rationis,</hi> barely deviſed Beings, and Words of a ſecond Notion or intention, as they are called who know not as yet Things, and the names of Things, <hi>Entia primae Intentionis,</hi> or Beings, whoſe meaning is to be firſt underſtood: and to bid them give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, why they ſpeak Latine right, before they can in any wiſe ſpeak properly, and of the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>? Right as if one ſhould ask a Countreyman the reaſon, why the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone drawes iron, before he know it drawes it; or one that's unskill'd in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> why in a Triangle three Angles are equall to two ſtraight ones, before he know that it is ſo. For neither is it poſſible for theſe boyes hitherto to know any word of the Latine Tongue, Noun, or Verb, unleſſe they know before, or together, what Figure, Caſe, Mood, Tenſe, Perſon, &amp;c. every one of them is; to learn any Phraſe, any Sentence, unleſſe before or together they be able to give an account, by what Rule of the <hi>Syntax</hi> they may ſpeak ſo after this, and not after another manner. All which things are contrived and appointed to this intent, that a boy firſt learn the terms of Art, before he learn the names of Things. In the abridgments of the Grammar, which are commonly uſed amongſt us, there are reckoned an hundred and fourſcore words of Art and above; in the <hi>Syntax</hi> ſeventy and more Rules, with as many Exceptions; and moſt of which are ſo obſcure, that they can ſcant be underſtood by thoſe of greater age, who are already well grown, and more forward in judgement and learning. Now what elſe are all theſe things at laſt, but ſo many Impediments and Hinderances to Childrens age; yea, ſo many Miſchiefs and Gallowſes ſet up for the ſame, ſo many trifling lets and incumbrances, with which boyes are deteined and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61230:11"/>
troubled in the ſame faſhion that little young chickens are fettered with the intanglements of womens hairs thrown out a doors, and wrapped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their legs? Verily, as if the Latine Tongue neither could, nor ought to be learned, ſave with main and lamentable labour, and ſo great a loſſe of youthfull age. Now if anyone ask touching ſuch words of Art any of our Countrey-men in our own Germane Tongue, which we have learned without any Precepts, by Uſe onely, and demand a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why we ſpeak in our Tongue after this, and not another manner? he might well be judged to be mad, as one who doth not reſt contented with the common Uſe and Cuſtome of ſpeaking,

            <p>And which is the moſt certain Umpire, Miſtreſs, and Judge above or beyond all exception, but craves a reaſon, why we ſpeak on this wiſe? to know which, there is no need at all. But if upon this condition one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men were to be eſteemed to have good knowledge and skill in the Latine ſpeech, ſo far forth as they know theſe words of Art, and are able to accomodate them to their ſpeech, not ſo much, forſooth, as <hi>Varro</hi> the moſt learned of the Latines, nor <hi>Plautus</hi> the Prince of the Latine Tongue, ſhould be thought to have ſpoke Latine, who were perhaps ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and no doubt very learnedly ignorant of theſe words of Art, with wich boyes are tortured. If one were deſirous to teach an Inſant to walk, and ſhould ſet him not onely upon ſlippery ice, but likewiſe put upon his feet ſhoes laid with plates of moſt poliſht iron, and moreover apply ſtilts to his feet alſo; and were deſirous firſt to teach him to go artificially, before he can go even naturally, and on any faſhion: he would be accounted indeed no other then ſtark ſrantick. They truly in myopinion have long ſince been taken with the like madnes, who firſt of all brought into Schools this already for ſo many ages uſed way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boyes by Rules and Precepts. And far madder then which hitherto were thoſe, who propounded to boyes the Precepts of Grammar, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure in themſelves, and beſides that, incloſed in Verſes, in Verſes, I ſay, ſo obſcure, as may ſeem even to us who are further, grown in years, to ſtand in need of ſome <hi>Oedipus</hi> to underſtand them. Whereunto belong alſo thoſe ſo many other <hi>Compendium</hi>'s deviſed by many, and thoſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61230:11"/>
which are accumulated every day more then other: And thoſe which are deviſed indeed out of a good intendment and endeavour, but prove very unhappy in the event: ſo as thoſe <hi>Compendium</hi>'s or near Cuts are found by meer Uſe to be no other then <hi>Diſpendium</hi>'s, or a long way about and Impediments of youthful age. I ſaw one who went about to reduce all the Rules of the <hi>Syntax</hi> into ſeven or fewer, which in our vulgar or ordinary Books are found to be ſeventy and more; who while he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to avoid prolixity, fell into obſcurity. When at length after full ſore labours and infinite tediouſneſſe, they are brought not as boyes or ſtriplings, but as young men, to that paſſe, that they can make Latine on any ſort, according to thoſe ſo oft augmented and altered Rules and Precepts of Grammar, and can, as the ſaying is, ſwim without a bark, and are brought on to read Authours, they themſelves now begin to ſpeak Latine without any aid of Grammaticall Precepts: and here by and by again forget theſe very Grammaticall Precepts, which they learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being boyes and ſtriplings with grievous labour, of which truly there is not, as hath been aforeſaid, any more Uſe. Now then how ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a loſſe is it, to beſtow twelve, nay fifteen years upon thoſe things, and to weare out the moſt precious time of life in learning them without Book, which are a while after to be unlearned, certainly to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and by them to hinder the towardly growth of a tender wit; by them to offend and afllict; yea, to break and weaken it, whereof that age is not yet capable, and which are afterwards unprofitable, and which are to be of that eſteem thoſe matters are of, which we never learned? What ſhould I ſay? that theſe Precepts likely within a little while to be unprofitable are throughly learned by School boyes, no otherwiſe; nor are they any otherwiſe exacted, then if they were the Oracles of God, without which we can neither be well here, nor hereafter. To which furthermore may be added the mention of Maſters, who require that to theſe Grammar-rules their own Dictates and Precepts be well learned: and in the learning whereof, if boyes do but ſtick never ſo little, or ſtumble at them, preſently comes the Rod and laſh in uſe. For hence it falls out that to Maſters themſelves, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Scholar like become choler-like employments; and hearing, grow wearing places: that the School to learners of an ingenuous ſport becomes a Gallows-like torture due to ſlaviſh Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. And that ſervile fear which boys get in Schools from this teaching, ſticks by many all their life long I knew a certain man, who devoutly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61230:12"/>
and ſolemnly affirm'd to me, he learn'd the Grammar &amp; the Latin tongue at School under ſo harſh &amp; ſevere Maſters, that he oftentimes after he was grown to mans eſtate thought in his dreams he ſtill lived &amp; trembled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his jerking Maſter. Now how much better were it to teach boys in an ingenuous School with moderation and fair dealing, and to bring good wits to the ſtudy of the liberall Arts, not ſervilely, but courteouſly and tenderly? For what is thus learned, is welcome to nature, and takes better and firmer hold; whereas on the contrary whatſoever is violent goes againſt nature, and but ſeldome continues or laſts long. Whereto likewiſe accrues this miſchief no leſſe then the former, that young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars when they have ſcarcely with a great deal of labour learned a few Latine names and words, they have eft-ſoones exerciſes ſet them, which are to tranſlate Dutch into Latine: that is, they are bid to make that which as yet they never conceiv'd. They would do far better and more handſomely, if they were to turn things out of Latine into their own Dutch Tongue, or were to expreſſe and conſtrue Latine in Dutch. For into what Tongue any one deſires to tranſlate another tongue, and by what Tongue as an Interpreter any one hath a minde to learn any other Tongue, that Tongue which he uſeth by way of interpretation ought to be very well known unto him. Now what abſurdity is it to require of a boy to tranſlate his Mother German tongue into Latine, which he hath not yet learned, but ſtill learneth? which truly ſeems alike abſurd; as if a Virgin were bid to bring forth children. And hence moreover is that foul matter, that Barbariſmes and Germaniſmes do every where ſtain the purity of Latine Speech; to wit, when boyes are commanded by their own proper invention, or of their own heads to conjoyn terms and words collected out of <hi>Daſypodius,</hi> Vocabulary <hi>Sylva</hi>'s, and Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries according to the Precepts and Rules of Grammar, and to forme or frame to themſelves the Latine Tongue according to the Precepts of Grammar by their own induſtry. Which when they are not drawn out of the full fountains of Latine, nay of Romane Authours, but out of ſhrunk-up, dry, and liquorleſſe rivolets of the Latine, and ſometimes ſcarcely Latine Speech; and that in a manner not by the guidance of Maſters, but by the unfortunate attempt of their very Scholars; we need not go far to ſeek, to ſay as <hi>Perſius</hi> hath it;

And if any ſhall ask me, ſince I miſlike that uſual and old way of teaching, What other New One is it then, which I can approve of, or ſet forth?

            <p>Foraſmuch as it is farre eaſier for me in this place to ſhew and confute things which are falſe and amiſs, then to affirm other that are better and righter. Howbeit I am already determined here to expoſe and ſet before the cenſures of good men, what I think of this matter, and what my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and thoughts have formerly been concerning it. And which whatſoever they are, if Experience it ſelf, the touchſtone for ſuch buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, were applied to them, and might render a proof of the things which I am about to tell, I ſhould be conceited it would go better with them. But if I have not yet found the moſt compendious way, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I am confident and know theſe things whatever they are, to be ſuch, as if any one vouchſafe to make trial of them, they may ſerve, as they ſay, to break at firſt the ice of that difficulty, wherewith Schools are hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to incumbred. And who need make any doubt that more may be added daily to ſuch Inventions? Certainly the very Exerciſe and Uſe thereof will ſhew every day more things that it may at length (all obſtacles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, which have made this. Way unto honeſt and pious Arts and Learning hard to all, and to many invincible) declare it ſelfe to be plain and ready. Yea, if I ſhall ſeem perhaps to have propounded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61230:13"/>
which may be thought worth the labour, I ſhall preſent at leaſt an handle, and an occaſion to others either to enquire things not found out, or to ſhevv things found out to every one, and not to envy Mankinde that which God hath ſhewed them in the behalf of its welfare, but to expoſe it to the whole World. For this is the nature of all good men to communicate to all, for which things by how much the more and unto the more they are communicated, by ſo much the more, and the rather do they ſerve and ſuffice all. And now to begin from the firſt principlus of Reading, and from the entrances and grounds of Letters, I think a boy before the fifth or ſixth year of his age, according to thoſe powers of towardneſſe and wit, which put forth themſelves, ought not to be put to this teaching: and that not onely for this Reaſon, becauſe that tender age being as it were a little tender branch, but even newly ſhot out, ought not to be ſwayed with this kinde of teaching (although it be likely to have little tediouſneſſe and trouble) as it were with a certain burthen: But alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the mean time it ought to learn its own Countrey-language, by which as an Interpreter it may learn the Latine the better and more fully. And with which Mother-tongue the fuller Children ſhall be indued, the ſooner will they profit in thoſe things which I ſhall ſpeak of. The mean while alſo that age being a little more confirmed, will be the apter and ſitter to receive Learning. For we muſt beware of theſe two things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other in all teaching, and in this eſpecially, that we offer not to poure a ſirkin into him who can ſcarce take a ſpoonfull; and that we lay not many pounds upon him who can ſcarcely bear a few drams: That we do not, I ſay, raſhly impoſe ought, as 'tis done hitherto upon the age of Children, which it may not be able to bear. The other is, that all thoſe things, which are on this wiſe, according to their capacity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them, be ſo impoſed, and ſo required of them, that they may do nothing with an ill will, by force and conſtraint, but perform all things as far as may be, freely, and of their own accord, with a certain ready willingneſſe or delightfull deſire of the minde. Whence I am verily of opinion, that rods, and ſtrokes, thoſe ſervile inſtruments, and ſuch as do not well ſort and agree with ingenuous natures, ought not to be uſed in Schools, but to be far removed, and to be applied to ſlaves and naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſervants that are of a ſervile inclination: and ſuch as in Schools time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewray themſelves by their own diſcovery, and are timely to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thence, not onely for the ſlowneſſe of diſpoſition, which is for the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61230:13"/>
moſt part proper to ſervile natures, but alſo for that ſhrewdneſſe, which is for the moſt part joyned with it: And to which if there be the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the helps of Learning and Arts, they will be but turned into weapons of wickedneſſe, and be ſwords in the hands of boyes, yea of mad folks, for to cut their own and others throats withall. But there are other kindes of puniſhments which would be made uſe of with inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Children and liberall mindes, and wherewith they are ſorer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and more cruelly vext, then with any the ſharpeſt and ſmarteſt laſhes of rods. As for inſtance, that thoſe who do not as they ſhould do, who minde not what their Maſters ſay unto them, who obey not their Maſters commands, or are otherwiſe found too negligent and tardy, or taken in ill and unhappy turnes, be ſet either in the loweſt place beneath all, or be enjoyned while others ſit to ſtand in ſome certain place ſet apart, or ſevered from the other company for idle and lazy boyes; or be made to wear ſome mark or enſigne of an aſſe, upon their ſhoulders, or to put on for a while the habit of a fool in a play, or be puniſhed with ſome ſuch like kinde of penalties which the favourable diſcretion of School-maſters may eaſily deviſe and finde out, ſuch a ſort of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not onely more grieve and fret to the heart generous and free natures, then if they were tormented with the moſt exquiſite dolours or pains of the body: but will alſo diſcern and diſtinguiſh them from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile diſpoſitions. For whoſoever ſhall ſet at naught or contemn this manner of puniſhment, and is led neither with any ſweetneſſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, nor offended at or moved with the bitterneſſe of diſpraiſe: it's an argument of a diſ-ingenuous inclination, of an ignoble minde; and whereof there can neither be any great hope or expectation to ſpeak of, conceived. And as the ſer<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ile and ſlothfull are to be diſcerned and reſtrained by ſuch a kinde of puniſhment; ſo contrariwiſe, fiery, forward, and quick diſpoſitions are ſtill to be put on and further excited by more honourable places and higher formes: That thoſe who approve their towardneſſe or diligence above others to the Maſter, may obtain like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a more honourable or eminent place then the reſt. Now what pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are aſſigned to any one, whether the higheſt of reward, or the loweſt in matter of puniſhment, ought not to be aſſigned longer, then any one ſhall deſerve it either by naughtineſſe and negligence; or ſhall maintain and keep it by goodneſſe and diligence. For ſo it will be, that neither the firſt ſhall truſt in this their degree of honour, and as it comes to paſs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61230:14"/>
ſlack in their diligence; nor the loweſt deſpair, as if they could not get out of the place of ſluggards again by their diligence. Seeing both the foremoſt, if they grow too negligent, may by the hindemoſt, being more diligent, be caſt dovvn from their upper degree, and thruſt out of their place; that ſo the higheſt may be lovveſt; and again, the lovveſt and laſt by uſing of diligence and induſtry, of the laſt may become the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt, yea the higheſt. And better it vvere that there ſhould be inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted ſuch Exerciſes of a laudable <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or deſire of honour, and nevv places allotted to one or other in reference to every ones diligence or negligence, not every half year, after the appointed Examinations, as uſeth to be in our Schools but every week, yea truly every day, that ſo one after another might be ſtirred up and encouraged to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence by this commendable Emulation and Ambition. Now to touch ſome few things by way of an Eſſay or fore-taſte concerning the firſt Principles of Learning, even the very Characters of Letters, how theſe may be learned by a boy of five or ſix years of age compendiouſly without either long labour or time. Paſſing painful and tedious is that way which is brought into Schools, and uſed hitherto, when they learn out of A, B, C, Books to know the Letters, to put them together in ſyllables, and to pronounce them; and ſo in concluſion to read. For as to the knowing of the formes or ſhapes of Letters, and the diſcerning of one from another, that hardſhip may be overcome far more compendiouſly and eaſily, if certain Inſtruments be made to repreſent every letter in its outward forme, and ſuch as may derive their names from ſeverall letters. By which help Children may learn to know the Letters even a playing with one another, out of doubt in a very few dayes. Now for theſe Letters, to what Inſtruments and Images they are to be applied and expreſſed, the Manner thereof hath been deviſed long ſince not unhandſomely. Now I do not here, by reaſon of the cavils of the prepoſterouſly vviſe, ſet out this Manner or way, ſeeing it contains many things ridiculous, and vvhich are fitted to childrens age. Hovvbeit, they are ſuch as may have that of the Poet verified concerning them,

And may bring boyes even vvhile they be at their ſports with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſaving of time and labour thither; vvhither they are brought both by the wofull labour of their Maſters that teach, and tediouſneſſe of the boyes that learn ſcarcely in a long time, yea ſcarcely without rods and ſtripes. For viſible Images or Reſemblances of this ſort running into the eyes, fitted to the formes or faſhions of Letters, and marked with the names of Letters, are far ſooner and more thoroughly imprinted in the minde and memory of boyes, and in their impreſſion ſtick far more firmly and cloſely. For the tender mindes of younger ones do ask; yea, meer nature and humane reaſon doth require this, that thoſe things which ought to be comprehended by the minde in the treaſury of the memory, ſhould be by ſome certain outward notes and figures, as it were helps by the looking on of the eyes, and the ſenſe of ſeeing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed upon the underſtanding of the minde, and on the memory by a ſtronger imagination, becauſe that, as Naturaliſts know very well, there can be nothing in the underſtanding, which is not before in the ſenſe. And as that which hath been in the ſenſe is more notable, or even more ridiculous, ſo it ſtrikes or ſtamps the imagination more ſtrongly, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints its forme upon the very memory more inwardly, and ſo alſo ſticks the ſurer and the longer in the memories treaſury, as 'tis known to thoſe who profeſſe an Artificiall Memory, which is performed by images and places. As for example, the letter L, not the turn'd, but the running one, as it's called by Printers, being made very exactly in wood or braſſe, is repreſented by that Inſtrument where with we meaſure linnen, and cloth, and other things. And that Inſtrument, ſeeing it is called in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-Idiome or proper ſpeech an Ell, and is ſufficiently known to boyes, a man may eaſily bring it for to get the knowledge of the forme of the Letter L at once ſhewing, or the firſt ſight, and to expreſſe the naming thereof. The ſame may be done in all the other letters, to which no leſs remarkable Images, for effecting the ſame thing, may be accommodated. Now when by ſuch like Images of creatures, Inſtruments, or moſt known Things, and fitted to the letters, figures, and namings, they have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the letters well; thoſe letters on ſome greater board or table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſed in their own naturall Characters ought to be depainted, and propounded ſo great, that they may even be manifeſtly ſeen by all at a right diſtance, and to which Letters thoſe Images of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or Inſtruments, (wherewith we ſaid a little before the figures
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61230:15"/>
and names of letters were to be expreſſed) being already fore-known to Children, ought to be put and fitted very cloſe, by this help a childe may eaſily learn to know the letters, and to expreſſe every one by it's own name. Which thing when 'tis well done the order then of nature doth further require, that after this apprehenſion of ſingle Letters, they learn to ſet them together; and by ſundry joynings together of letters, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe all Syllables, which may ariſe thence. Here now in ſome other greater Table thoſe Letters, together with thoſe aforeſaid Images, being ſet over or above to the vowels, and likewiſe to the conſonants, may be ſo diſpoſed one with another in three lines; as the conſonants from <hi>b</hi> to <hi>m,</hi> may be placed in the upper line; the other conſonants from <hi>n</hi> to <hi>z,</hi> in the lower, and the five vowels in the middle place between the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in the middle line. From which letters thus diſpoſed or ordered, and already known to Children, School-maſters ſhall be able to expreſſe any ſyllables whatſoever, and to ſhew to children all the variety of ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, whether a Syllable conſiſt of one letter being a vowel, or of two, <hi>viz.</hi> a vowel and a conſonant; or of three, as of one vowel and of two or four, or laſtly of five conſonants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That ſo a paſſage may be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made through all the varieties of ſyllables; and that no ſyllable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the divers compoſition of the conſonants in the firſt and third lines, with the vowels in the middle line, may in any wiſe be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by untouched, or not expreſſed, whether a vowel occupy the firſt, ſecond, third, or fourth place in a ſyllable. And the Maſter with ſome little pointing-ſtick paſſing through all the variety of Syllables in the firſt, ſecond, and third<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> line, and laying it on every letter, ſhall ſhew what letters are to be brought together into one ſyllable, and ſhall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Children for ſome certain dayes in the collecting of thoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into ſyllables. Which exerciſe ſhall teach Children more fully the names of the Letters, when they are ſo often repeated, together with thoſe Images joyned thereto, in which the formes, and appellations, or callings of the Letters are expreſſed. And this excerciſe may hold and laſt ſo long, till ſuch time as they ſhall come to know thoſe Letters well, whether vowels or conſonants, and alſo begin to underſtand, what arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate voice the Letters joyned together among themſeves into ſome ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, and to be uttered with one breath and a ſingle ſound, may expreſs. Now if this be not done in the ſpace of a few weeks, it ſhall be either long of the negligence and idleneſſe of Maſters; or at leaſt of the too
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61230:15"/>
groſs dulneſs &amp; ſtupidity of the boy, which is to be taught. In which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, while the Maſter is employed, he ſhall eſpecially indeavour this, that all attend diligently, and that they be every one ſet to the Table hung up, that they may ſhew all the letters by putting the little ſtick or wand upon them, or pronounce and expreſſe them, being pointed out by the Maſter; or elſe be puniſhed in the manner before mentioned. For ſo it will come to paſs, that by one, and that indeed an eaſie labour, they may teach all; whereas otherwiſe when they are driven to teach all, <hi>viz.</hi> every one in their own A, B, C, or Alphabeticall Books, they muſt of neceſſity beſtow and ſpend ten times more labour in teaching one, then in this way which I have ſpoken of even in teaching an hundred, or more together. Whereto alſo this is to be added, that, when ſo many, being equals, are taught together with one and the ſame labour, they become inflamed and put into courage by the emulation of one another, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a ſhameful and baſe buſineſſe for them to be out-gone and left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde by their equals.</p>
            <p>When they have now well learned theſe Letters by theſe helps of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and have begun to expreſſe Syllables in Letters joyned or put together, on that manner as I have ſaid, now theſe aids of figments or imaginary devices being laid aſide for one turn or two as yet, in the manner formerly explained; let there be a paſſing through all the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Syllables, that ſo they may learn to know the Letters placed on that wiſe alone, and by themſelves, without ſuch an Image, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe any one in it ſelf, and with others.</p>
            <p>Now that all things which appertain to Reading, may be more fully and abundantly learned, there are yet further two or more greater. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to be uſed, wherein all the Syllables of two, three, four, five, or more Letters may be expreſſed, not indeed as in the former Table, in Letters ſevered or diſ-joyned from one another, and in three lines onely ſo diſpoſed, as they cannot but by the Maſters guiding and ſhewing with a ſtick put thereon be brought into a Syllable, but ſo as they may be ſeen expreſſed in letters, joyned together one with another. And in theſe Tables, let the very whole variety of Syllables, none at all excepted, be ſet expreſly before the eyes in joyned letters. And let all and ſingular boyes, without paſſing by any, be ſet to theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that order which ſhall ſeem fitting to their Maſters, and let them, taking a twig into their hands, note the ſeveral Letters which are to be joyned together in a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61230:16"/>
by putting it thereupon, let them alſo expreſſe them with an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate voice in all the Syllables, to which the reſt are to attend diligently. Whence truly it will fall out, that in a little time both by their eyes and eares they may very fully perceive all the diverſity and variety of the Letters either alone, or joyned with others; as likewiſe of Syllables, of which thoſe innumerable words in the Latine Tongue, <hi>viz.</hi> Nouns and Verbs are made up; nor may there be any thing left, which may in any ſort further ſtop or hinder them in reading.</p>
            <p>When theſe foundations of Reading are on this manner well laid, then a further progreſſe may be made to the exerciſe of Painting or Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which thing is to be referred to the truſt of faithfull Maſters and Artiſts in that kinde, who ſhall at firſt by few draughts of Characters ſhew the grounds of all the Letters, and teach the Writing of them all eaſily and neatly.</p>
            <p>Now that we may come at laſt by Gods help to learn the Latine Tongue compendiouſly, and in as ſhort a ſpace of time as may be; to it there ſeems &amp; Twofold Courſe and Way may be taken and contrived. The one whereof is the ſureſt and readieſt, by which the Latine Tongue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone may be diſpatched, and whereof I ſhall give notice in a few words hereafter. The other is a little more painful, and more cumberſome, or ungain, by reaſon of our own Countrey-German-ſpeech, with which the Latine Tongue either alwayes or for a while marches joyntly, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then a Roman Matron with her German Interpreter; yet it is four times, as I relying on Gods aſſiſtance do verily perſwade my ſelf, more ready or gainer then that wherewith Maſters and Scholars macerate themſelves hitherto in Schools.</p>
            <p>Now that which I ſignified a little before touching Reading, that this tender age for the obtaining a ſpeedier knowledge of the Characters of Letters is to be helpt with ſome certain Inſtruments or Images running into the eyes; the ſame alſo I here repeat in the learning the Latine Tongue, eſpecially when children are to be taught: who are to be brought into a place where all things which may be ſeen by the eyes, touched with the hands, ſet forth by the penſil or the pen, even as many as we ſhall meet with throughout the whole world, to be expreſſed in Latine words, may be ſhewed to them in a well-diſpoſed order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For from theſe things falling under the ſenſe of the eyes, and as it were more knovvn, vve vvill make entrance and begin to learn the Latine ſpeech. Four-footed living
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61230:16"/>
Creatures, creeping Things, Fiſhes, and Birds, vvhich can neither be gotten, nor live well in theſe parts, ought to be painted. Others alſo, which becauſe of their bulk and greatneſſe cannot be ſhut up in houſes, may be made in a leſſer forme, or drawn with the penſil, yet of ſuch a bigneſſe as they may be well ſeen by boyes even afar off. <hi>And I would to God, that among ſo great a multitude and ſtore of Books with which the world is now troubled, and in ſo great covetouſneſſe and greedineſſe of Stationers every way hunting after gain, there might but have ſuch a Book, as I have ſo often counſelled and perſwaded the Book-ſellers, and Artiſts in the Low-Countreys unto, once come forth into Print; in which all things whatſoever which may be deviſed and written, and ſeen by the eyes, might be deſcribed, ſo as there might be alſo added to all things, and all parts and members of things, its own proper word, its own proper appellation or term expreſſed in the Latine and Dutch Tongue.</hi> Which thing how great an advantage it would be like to bring to the learning of the Latine Tongue, more fully and more quickly is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to be ſpoken. Now the words for theſe things, albert they may extend themſelves in number to ſome thouſands, yet by this means and help which I have named, they may be learned of boyes in the ſpace of a few weeks. For as I have ſaid formerly of Letters, that outward view or ſurvey of viſible Things by the ſenſe of ſeeing, ſets a ſtronger ſtamp upon the imagination, and the waxen Tables of the memory of younger ones, and imprints the image and the terming of every thing far more thoroughly and deeply, then if it were brought by the ears, as it were by more uncertain meſſengers to the Memories treaſury. For thoſe things which are viſible, ought to enter by the ſight, and not by hearing. As on the other ſide, what things are perceived by the ſenſe of hearing, as ſounds, and all kindes of voices be, thoſe are ſubject to the judgement of the ears, and can no more be ſeen or painted; then that Eccho, the Painter whereof <hi>Auſonius</hi> jeers and laughs at. In the vulgar or ordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nary way of teaching, all things are referred to the ears, which ought to be known and perceived by the judgement of the eyes. And School-maſters have judged it ſufficient, if Scholars could perceive onely by the ears the words or terms for things, notwithſtanding they have never hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſeen or caſt their eyes upon many of them. Viſible things are firſt to be known by the eyes, before their Appellations and words ſhould be perceived by the ears. For firſt, care ought to be taken that we may ſee Things, know them, and diſcern them one from another, which is done
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61230:17"/>
by the benefit of the eyes, before that there be the word for every thing, and a ſhewing what term it hath, which thing is perceived by the ſenſe of the ears. Moreover, the ſight comprehends things far ſurer then the hearing, whereupon he in the Comoedy had rather have one eye-witneſs then ten ear-witneſſes. And <hi>Horace</hi> ſaith,
<q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Segniùs irritant animos demiſſa per aurens,</l>
                     <l>Quàm quae ſunt oculis ſubjecta fidelibus. </l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>The ear not in ſuch quick and moving wiſe</l>
                     <l>Conveys things to the minde, as do the eyes.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Yea rightly in this teaching is the one conjoyned with the other, that both the eyes and the ears may perceive and know thoſe things which are proper to them in particular. For appellations and terms of things expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſound of the tongue, are perceived by the ears; ſo on the contrary, the very Things which are meant by theſe appellations and termes, are perceived by the eyes. And the joyning, together of theſe two is by far the profitableſt and the braveſt courſe and paſſing ſit and appliable to the age of Children. For as it avails little in common and ordinary converſe with men to know Things themſelves which thou canſt not expreſſe by their certain names and appellations: So on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it vvill not benefit thee at all to learn and knovv vvords, and to be ignorant of Things vvhich are intimated thereby. For none ſhall over-apply vvords to their ovvn matters in a right manner, during his ignorance of Things. There are ſuch as theſe in abundance, vvhich boyes learn out of <hi>Nomenclators,</hi> and other <hi>Lexicons,</hi> no othervviſe then Parrats, vvho underſtand not mens vvords, and knovv not vvhat it is vvhich they learn and ſpeak. And of vvhich ſort are the moſt of thoſe <hi>Homoeoteleuta,</hi> or riming verſes, vvhich vvere deviſed as <hi>Compendium</hi>'s or advantages for the helping of childrens age, out of a good intention truly, and vvould to God vvith event and ſucceſſe anſvverable thereto, as are theſe, <hi>Manus &amp; Pignus, Mors &amp; Sors,</hi> vvhich in our ovvn Tongue end in one Syllable, <hi>Handt, Pandt, Dodt, Lott.</hi> When boyes, for the moſt part are ignorant vvhat Lot and vvhat a Pavvn is. And vvhat doth it profit one to knovv vvhat Latine vvord anſvvers to the Dutch, if he be ignorant of that matter?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61230:17"/>
Therefore when boyes are taught, what Latine word anſwers to the Dutch, the thing it ſelf which is ſignified by that Dutch or Latine word ought to be ſhewed them together, and all under one. Yea, thoſe Things ought to be ſhewn in the firſt place, that they may obſerve and mark them well by their eyes and fancies. Then the appellation and name of the Thing is to be added afterwards. And in this regard it were better, I ſuppoſe, that children, while they are over-little, and remain ignorant, as yet of the vulgar namings of Things even in their own Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeech, were not put to this teaching. Whatſoever it be, in vain are words learned, of whoſe Things we are ſtill ignorant. Therefore let Things themſelves or at leaſt the Images of Things, whether painted or engraven, be expoſed to the eyes of children, that they may know, what thoſe Things are whoſe appellations and names they get by heart, that ſo they may learn ſomethings ſolidly. For by ſuch helps childrens tender age is to be aſſiſted: and manifold are the benefits which it receives from hence. For they both learn Things themſelves, and the proper appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of thoſe very Things, which they have perceived, and the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine names and words in each Language, as well in their own Mother, as in the Latine Tongue, which they ought to learn by the interpretative Dutch. And this knowledge onely is certain and ſolid, by which a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſolid foundation of the Latine Tongue is laid, the beginning or entrance being made from Things falling under the ſenſe of the eyes, and thoſe indeed moſt known, and daily obvious.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, all Things which can be perceived by the ſenſe of the eyes, deſcribed or imagined, ought by ſome ſure way, the beginning being made from things more known, to be ſhewed to children, and ſet before their eyes. The beginning, I ſay, being made from Things more known, and from thoſe Things which firſt of all occur to children that begin to ſpeak, and which they have firſt of all begun to know, and to name with a ſtammering voice in their own Mother-Tongue, as are the Things which be in the Houſe, in the Bed-chamber, in the Dining-room, in the Kitchin, in the Street, which are daily obvious to them, and lie as it were in their way before them, or things themſelves (which if they be lightly had, are altogether to be preferred) or at leaſt the pictures of theſe very Things which are ſufficiently known. That ſo there may be a paſſage from the firſt moſt common Things to ſeverall others; and as it were an aſcent by little and little from the loweſt to the higher. Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61230:18"/>
as we have mentioned before, ought to be painted, and none but thoſe at the firſt which are known to Children that begin to learn the Latine Tongue. Moreover, all thoſe terms or words, whoſe Things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſignified can be ſeen and painted, may be taken out of the <hi>Nomencla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of that moſt excellent man <hi>Hadrianus Junius,</hi> or others; Provided that the <hi>Exordium</hi> or beginning be made from thoſe which are more known. Here let there be preſented and offered to the eyes all Houſhold-Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Things belonging to Smiths or Carpenters craft; Things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Countrey, to War, to Shipping, to Fiſhing, to Hunting, to Tailory, to Muſick, and to Sewing, whatſoever is to be met with in the buſineſſe of Books or Study in mans body, and in all its parts and members: All living creatures, four-footed Beaſts, Birds, Fiſhes, Wormes, Inſects, Colours, Herbs, Trees, Fruits, all womenly Inſtruments, and thoſe that belong to Weaving, Baking, Riding, Playing, and Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. Laſtly, all thoſe Things which are ſet before the eyes, which if they cannot conveniently be had in Things themſelves, ſurely they may be painted. Let younger ones be brought to theſe things, or to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of Things well known already from the contemplation of the Things themſelves, depainted in Tables, the namings of which Things they ſhall firſt learn in their own, and then in the Latine Tongue, which will be ſooner then one would think effected. Now theſe Pictures of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Things may be ſo drawn, as there may be three, four, or more Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, according as the manner of ſeverall Things doth require, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in greater pages, yet ſo as they may be well diſtinguiſhed one from another by a due ſpace, and ſo as the Latine word joyned with the Dutch being put under, may be writ the next to them, in letters of that big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as may be read by boyes who have learned already to read, and ſo alſo furthermore as a certain line drawn from the words written by the very Things, may ſhew what words mark out any of the Things. Theſe Things thus painted and joyned to their words, ſhall anſwer to thoſe firſt Elements of Letters. For as of thoſe put together there are made Syllables; ſo of theſe Things divided or compounded there are made Sentences And this Way is natural and ſuitable to childrens capacity, of which in all the teaching of children eſpecially and before all things one ought to have a due regard. Whence that common manner of teaching is the more to be condemned, in which there are firſt of all words of Art propounded to boyes, whoſe Things ſignified by the words
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61230:18"/>
can neither be painted, nor counterfeited, and in this reſpect are not to be conceived by the imagination of children. The Tables and Pages in which theſe Images of viſible Things, as I have ſaid, are painted, may be ſo compoſed, as they may be folded after the manner of leaves in a great Book, and be ſet in a very notable place. In knowing theſe Things, and in the explaining of them by their own words children ought to be ſo long exerciſed, till they ſhall have already perceived theſe words in ſome ſort. I ſay, in ſome ſort; for I would not have children be long ſtayed and buſied in the knowing of theſe naked and ſeparate words, but timely to paſſe on to the compoſition and diviſion of theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhort Phraſes and Sentences. In theſe Sentences let not theſe words be propounded alwayes in the Nominative or firſt Caſe onely, but alſo in the Second and Third, and the other Caſes. Let not, I ſay, theſe words be propounded alone, as hiterto they have been, but with other words and termes joyned in ſome certain Sentences. As for example, let not theſe words as hitherto be propounded ſeverally, or by themſelves and in the firſt Caſe, <hi>Panis,</hi> Bread; <hi>Felis,</hi> a Cat; <hi>Sella,</hi> a Stool; <hi>Mek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> a Table; <hi>Scamnum,</hi> a Bench. For if they ſhall ſtand the longer in learning theſe Words put ſunderly, and in the firſt Caſe: by and by when they ought to joyn them together with others, and to connect them in ſome Sentence, they do that for the moſt part in the firſt Caſe, when the order of the Latine Speech requires other Caſes. Beſides theſe words thus naked and ſet alone are learned of boyes far more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly then if they he joyned with a Verb and a Noun, as 'tis termed, Adjective in ſome ſhort Phraſe or little Sentence; as for example, <hi>Panis in menſâ poſitus eſt,</hi> The bread is ſet upon the table; <hi>Felis vorat Marem,</hi> The Cat devours the Mouſe; <hi>Puer ſedet in ſellâ,</hi> The boy ſits upon the ſtool; <hi>Cants jacet ſub menſâ,</hi> The Dog lieth under the table; <hi>Puella dormit in ſcamno,</hi> The Girle ſleeps upon the bench. And if ſuch like names be thus with other words and termes in a ſhort Phraſe or little Sentence propounded to a childe, ſo as he may, conſidering the capacity of that age, perceive it: much profit will redound from thence. For he will both learn all Things twice as ſoon, and perceive twice, nay thrice as much, and be brought preſently as it were into the very uſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Latine. And examples in this ſort of Sentences may be ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, as the Nouns or names may paſſe through all the Caſes, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Declenſions, Genders; and the Verbs through all Moods, Tenſes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61230:19"/>
and Perſons. For example, A boy will not ſo eaſily underſtand what that is which is called <hi>Canis, Praeſepe, Bos, Faenum, Cornu, &amp;c.</hi> if they be aſunder or apart, as if they were propounded in ſome ſhort and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous Sentence; as ſuppoſe in this, <hi>Cauisjacet in praeſepi,</hi> The Dog lies in the Manger: <hi>Bos habet Faenum in Cornu,</hi> The Oxe hath hay upon his horne. Juſt as in a picture, which conſiſts of one ſingle Thing, and is expreſs'd with one colour or <hi>Monochrom</hi> in a ſingle living creature, or Inſtrument; as for inſtance, in a Sheep, Hog, or Sword, every one being ſevered and ſet by themſelves; it will never ſo much take or affect the eye and fancie of the looker on, as ſome excellent picture, in which all theſe are joyntly, and in their colour diſtinctly ſet before the eyes; as for example, the Picture of furious <hi>Ajax,</hi> killing Hogs and Sheep with his ſword. And as a boy when he hath already well learned the ſingle Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, will learn to read far ſooner, the more, and the timelier he is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in putting together two Letters, and anon more into one Syllable, and in uttering them with one ſingle voice, then if: he ſhould ſtay the longer upon the knowing and pronouncing of ſingle Letters ſet ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one by one. So alſo will a boy learn to ſpeak Latine far ſooner, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath in ſome ſort perceived the Latine words joyned together with their Things, (which may in that manner, as hath been formerly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be done by Gods help, within a few weeks) he be the timelier exerciſed in theſe compounds of thoſe ſimple words, Nouns and Verbs; to wit, in Sentences and Phraſes, then if he ſhould be deteined, and ſtay the longer upon the learning the names of ſingle Things or their Images. Therefore, as Syllables are made of ſingle Letters, and words of Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, conſiſting of two, three, four, five, or more Syllables; ſo of ſingle names, terms, and words, there are made Phraſes and Sentences, ſome conſiſting of fewer, others of more words. Laſtly, as words are made of Syllables; ſo are Speeches and Sermons made of Sentences. Here then for the tender age of children a certain way to the Latine Tongue might be made no leſſe eaſie and ready then fine and delightful, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both boyes and Maſters might by a good reformation finde this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; this diſpleaſure, leaſure; and the Learner, this hateful torturing, a grateful tutouring place; and the Teacher, this painful vocation, a gainful vacation; that the School might be anſwerable to its own name, and be as 'tis termed. <hi>Ludus literarius.</hi> Which verily will come to paſſe, if all thoſe Things, whoſo Images ſet out before in Pictures, and to which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61230:19"/>
their own proper words have been written, being after a ſort perceived and known of boyes already, as in making up Sentences, names, and words are compounded one with another: So alſo were Things expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the names and words of thoſe Sentences ſhadowed out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in certain Pictures. So as among the ſingle Pictures of Things, not ſo much as any Picture of a Thing may be paſſed by, which may not be once or twice compounded with others to ſet before the eyes, and expreſſe in a rude Picture ſome brief and pleaſant Sentence ſuited and ſorted to the capacity of Children. So as no word at leaſt of thoſe Things which may be ſeen, or painted, be over-ſlipt. But I would have theſe members of Sentences ſo made, as there may not be for the expreſſing of theſe ſeveral Sentences, or rather members of Sentences more then three, four, or five Things to be imitated in the Picture required. Now there is of ſuch like Names viſible and noted Things (for I ſpeak here of them onely, from which the beginning of this teaching is moſt rightly made) and which may be taken out of a <hi>Nomenclator</hi> and <hi>Lexicons,</hi> and ſuch have been noted by me a good while ſince, ſome certain number. And by which names, in the expreſſing theſe Sentences with a Picture, a paſſage may be ſo made, as not any name of thoſe Things which are better known to children, may be left untouched, to which may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Verbs and other parts of Speech. Alſo out of theſe Sentences there may be taken exerciſes, in which they may go through all Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Caſes in Nounes; and through all Tenſes, Moods, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Verbs, as we ſhall ſpeak of afterwards. Nor is there any reaſon that any ſhould be frighted with the multitude of Pictures, which are requiſite to expreſſe theſe members of Sentences, in the which the names of all Things viſible are conteined. For theſe Things compounded one with another, are abſolv'd or diſpatch'd in far fewer Pictures, then thoſe ſingle and ſimple Things above mentioned, or not in many more how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. For in theſe Pictures of compounded Things, in which, as I have ſaid, certain Sentences are expreſſed, in one Picture three, four, five, or even more Things may be joyned together. For example, in expreſſing a Whetſtone, and a Raſor, that remarkable Hiſtory or Fable of <hi>Accius Navius</hi> may be uſed and propounded in that Picture with this inſcription, <hi>Accius ſecat cotem novaculâ, Accius</hi> cuts a Whetſtone in ſunder with a raſor. In this Sentence and Picture two Nouns and one Verb are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. In the Picture, in which <hi>Equitat puer in arundine longâ,</hi> A boy
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61230:20"/>
rides upon a Hobby-horſe: four words are learned, two Noun Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, with one Adjective, and a Verb. In the Picture, where <hi>Leo Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num dilaniat curvis unguibus,</hi> The Lion tears the Aſſe in pieces with his crooked pawes; five words are learned, three Subſtantives and an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective, and a Verb. But I would not have theſe Sentences which are to be expreſſed in Pictures to exceed this number of five, or the number ſix at the utmoſt. And by ſuch like members of Sentences and Pictures one may eaſily paſſe through the whole Univerſity of all the more uſual words in the Latine Tongue, by which viſible Things are ſignified. Which thing at the firſt will put one to ſome labour and charge, yet not very much. But theſe Pictures once ſo made and procured may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards laſt alwayes, and ſerve for the teaching an infinite of boyes in the Latine Tongue. And who would not redeem with a little coſt ſo many years of mans life in many thouſands of children, whoſe turnes this one thing, when't is once provided, may ſerve? And which things whatever they coſt will moſt largely recompence their paines and charges which either a Prince or Common-wealth may eaſily ſuſtain. For a boy will learn in an hour even twenty or more ſuch Sentences ſo ſhewn in a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which being once and again repeated in the dayes following will moſt firmly and conſtantly ſtick by him. There ſhall be contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſeveral Pages or Tables ſeveral Pictures of that bigneſſe, as they may be well ſeen by all even afar off, the Tables may be evenly joyned together in the manner of ſome great Book, and ſet in a very clear place. And there ſhall be ſo many Books of this ſort made, as are ſufficient for the holding all the Pictures, wherein the more known viſible things are expreſſed, It will hence certainly come to paſſe, that children may learn and learn indeed exactly the termes of all viſible Things of this manner, with many Verbs, and other parts of the Latine Tongue. And in expreſſing which even learned and ancient men do oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en either ſtick or ſtumble. Now ſuch Latine Sentences and members of Sentences which are to be expreſſed in Pictures, ought to be pick't out with ſingular choice. To which thing there ſhould be uſed not onely the moſt memorable Sacred Hiſtories of the Old and New Teſtament, expreſſed in their Pictures, and explained in brief Sentences: for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſake, <hi>That God created the heaven and the earth. The Serpent deceived our firſt Parents.</hi> Cain <hi>kill'd his brother</hi> Abel. <hi>The Delugo overflowes the world. Fire from heaven burnoth</hi> Sodome. Abraham <hi>is minded to ſacrifice his ſon</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61230:20"/>
Iſaac. And the other Hiſtories choſen with accurate judgement, ſo as they may be explained by adding ſuch a Sentence, whoſe Verbs and Nouns may be eaſily comprehended by children. But alſo all notable things may be choſen out of Heatheniſh Hiſtories and Fables of <hi>Aeſop,</hi> the Poets and others. A rude knowledge of which kinde of Hiſtories and Fables, when children have as it were fore-taſted out of ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Pictures and Sentences, afterwards being ſtriplings and young men, they will not onely more readily and quickly in the fuller reading of this ſort of Hiſtories and Fables perceive all things, but alſo retein them in more faithfull memory. And in chuſing this ſort of Pictures that we may proceed in a more certain way, all the termes of this ſort of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and more uſed Things may be noted, and ſuch a pleaſant, ſhort, &amp; eaſie Sentence accommodated to each, which may be expreſſed in ſuch a Picture. For by that meanes the number of this ſort of Pictures will be eaſily ſhewn; nor will there be over-paſſed any term of any viſible Thing untouched or omitted. Now what names of viſible Things may not as yet be compriſed in this ſort of Hiſtories or Fables, may be eaſily added in any kinde of other Sentences, deviſed according to our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and expreſſed in a Picture. And while Maſters teach their Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars this ſort of termes, Nouns and Verbs in theſe Pictures and Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not onely the very Sentence which ſets out in a few words the ſum of the painted Hiſtory or Table, being written in greater letters, ought to be ſet as the title to the Picture; but alſo to thoſe two, three, or four Things, which are chiefly noted in the Picture, to each their own Latine words, under which the Dutch may be put, ought to be ſet the next in bigger letters, and by drawing a line, the termes to be conjoyned with their Things which they note; to the end, that the weak judgement of children may not erre in applying the ſeveral terms to their Things. Now here Maſters by the way ſhould adde, as they ſee good in theſe Sentences, which are let to the Pictures, the moſt full, profitable, and gallant exerciſes of the Latine Tongue, and ſuch as are likely to be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and pleaſant to children, in which a paſſage may be made through the Caſes and Numbers in Nouns, and through the Tenſes, Moods, and Perſons in Verbs: As for example, In the Picture of the Eagle feeding on the heart of <hi>Promethous;</hi> By the Picture of the Eagle and the heart let the Latine terms be writ the next, to which the Dutch may be put with this inſcription writ over the Picture, <hi>Aquila devorat cor</hi> Promethei,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61230:21"/>
The Eagle devours <hi>Prometheus</hi> his heart, together with the Dutch Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, ſo put under, as the Latine may anſwer word for word to the Dutch ſet under it. Here in few words that Fable may be expounded to Children, that ſo all things may be more acceptable and more manifeſt, and thoſe things which are uttered may be more throughly imprinted in their waxen memory. This example being both in the Picture, and in the Sentence expoſed to the eyes of Children, the Maſter may in the Noun, and in the Verb go through the Caſes, Numbers, Moods, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Perſons. As in the Nominative or firſt Caſe, <hi>Hic Aquila devorat cor</hi> Promethei. In the Genetive or ſecond Caſe, <hi>Pictura Aquilae qui de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voravit cor</hi> Promethei. In the Verb, <hi>devorat,</hi> one may paſſe over through Numbers, Moods, Perſons, &amp;c, And theſe exerciſes the Maſter may adde by the way in the ſole examples, without any Dictates or Precepts. Yet we muſt take heed, leſt theſe exerciſes from one propounded example prove too long, that one cannot likewiſe paſſe to the reſt, and go over all things maturely and in good time. Theſe examples in this ſort of exerciſes will haply ſeem ridiculous and fooliſh to ſome; but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſuch as are accomodated to Childrens age, and by which there is a moſt certain or ſure way laid to the knowledge of the Latine Tongue. In the Pictures and Sentences written thereunto, and in the exerciſes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as we have ſaid, out of theſe Sentences, Children for ſome ſuch time, as ſhall be thought ſufficient, ſhall be exerciſed, as the Maſter may propound all things in Latine, and interpret them in the Scholars own native Language. In which exerciſe, when they ſhall have gone over for ſome courſes, all theſe propoſed Pictures of viſible Things in the Sentences written thereunto, and in the exerciſes taken therefrom. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by turning or altering the order, the Maſter may propound to them all thoſe former things in Dutch, which the Children may be now enjoyned to expreſſe in Latine. Which thing while the Scholars are a doing, let the Maſters eſpecially do their endeavour, and have a care, that not ſo much as any Barbariſme or Germaniſme intervene. And for the uſe of this and the former exerciſe let the terminations of Nouns and Declenſions in their Numbers and Caſes; and of Verbs in the Moods, Number, and Perſons of the Conjugations drawn in two Tables hung up be propounded through which a paſſage may be made in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo far as ſhall ſeem fitting, I ſay the bare terminations onely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any names or appellations of Art. For this one and onely thing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61230:21"/>
transferred hither out of the precepts of Grammar may perhaps not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably be uſed. Not as though we cannot want theſe helps; but that hothing may be left untouched in theſe exerciſes, and that children may be brought on through all parts of the Latine Speech.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being diſpatch'd, when children are now brought on through all theſe Pictures of Things viſible and obvious, which being marked with certain appellations, names and termes, are extant in the whole circuit or circumference of the Latine Tongue, and are propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either alone, or joyned with others; and have been exerciſed at their entrance in the ſingle terms of theſe Things, afterward in Sentences which have been compounded of theſe ſingle termes; firſt of all in expreſſing the Latine with the Dutch, then the Dutch with the Latine. And even thus have begun by little and little to be made free in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to be brought as young Souldiers into the Latines tents. Now in the end theſe helps of Images and Pictures being left, they ſhall paſſe to a little freer and looſer exerciſe of Latine Speech; and there are to be added alſo other termes of Things, which are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by fight, nor expoſed to the eyes by the help of Pictures, but are comprehended by the other Senſes, the hearing, taſting, ſmelling, touching; and laſtly, by the minde and reaſon: and moreover, well neer all Nouns, Verbs, and parts of Speech, as many as are conteined in the whole compaſſe of the Latine ſpeech, not ſo much as any excepted. And which things they will now more eaſily perceive when they retain thoſe former things being indifferently known and taught already. For mans memory, imagination, and reaſon hath this peculiar, that the more Things it knowes, the more it can ſtill further receive, and is throughly filled and ſatisfied with nothing. Therefore thoſe termes of the Latine Speech which are yet remaining of Things Inviſible, Verbs and Nouns may be collected into Sentences that are brief, and comprehended in few words, ſo as the Sentences be perſpicuous, and ſuited to the capacity and benefit of this age, and that the beginning be made alwayes from thoſe which are more eaſie, and let not any word at all of the Latine Tongue of thoſe Things eſpecially which are more known, and occur more often, be left untouched. And theſe Sentences may be choſen with accurate judgement out of <hi>Forum Romanum,</hi> or the Promptuary of the Latine Tongue, or rather out of the very Authors of the Latine Tongue, ſo as in them may be ſeen not onely all variety of Genders, Caſes, Tenſes,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61230:22"/>
Moods, Perſons; but alſo that all the Rules of the <hi>Syntax</hi> may be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that there may be propounded a true, lively, and genuine Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar in brief, perſpicuous and pleaſant examples, not that baſtard and adulterate one in precepts and terms of Arts, of which childrens age is not yet capable. And by which examples, by which uſe and excerciſe, if the Latine tongue can be learned in two, or ſurely, three years ſpace, to what end ſhall we ſweat and toil ten, twelve or more years? For the moſt certain, and moſt ready courſe of learning any Tongue is by Uſe, and Exerciſe, and by Examples. Hard, troubleſome, harſh, unpleaſant, and hindred with infinite difficulties is the way of learning by Precepts. Now there's no reaſon that any one ſhould ſuſpect that theſe kinde of Books, in which all theſe Sentences, wherein the parts of the Latine Tongue are to be conteined, ſhould be orderly digeſted, are not to be procured or got without very great charges, and huge difficulties. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if there were onely juſt and due rewards appointed for this buſineſſe, whereof I have ſpoken, by thoſe who can, and even indeed ought: ſuch a Book might perhaps ſooner then one would think be provided and produced, in which all thoſe things might be conteined in order, which might be ſufficient for this matter. And in delivering which things, if Maſters would go before with that faithfulneſſe and diligence, which is meet; and in rendering which, if their Scholars would but follow, they might by and by be admitted to read, hear, and interpret with ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit the Authours of the Latine Tongue. And theſe things at length being taught and perceived, Children may be exerciſed in the ſtile of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſpeech both in ſpeaking and writing. For this ſhould not be done hitherto, becauſe it could not be done well. Nor indeed ſhould boyes be driven raſhly to ſpeak and write Latine by their own proper wit and invention without any aid or help, before that they have got themſelves, by theſe meanes which I have ſpoken of, the uſe of this kinde of Latine ſpeech, and from ſuch Things which they have not as yet conceived, or which being conceived, they have not as yet brought to maturity, there will ariſe <gap reason="foreign">

Now ſuch a Book may be made without either great labour or coſt, in which all things may be contained which are hereto required, and which may be uſed as common &amp; general in all Schools, and which might be as the Portal &amp; gate of the Latine ſpeech
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61230:22"/>
conſiſting, as hath been ſaid, of brief and perſpicuous Sentences, which Childrens age may not onely comprehend, but alſo comprehend with a certain pleaſure and willingneſſe of minde. Now in collecting theſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, this paines, which I have ſo often mentioned, is chiefly to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that they be not onely brief, but alſo Latine, and taken onely out of every the beſt Roman Authors, who have writ in Proſe or Verſe, Oratours and Poets, and that the beginning be made alwayes from thoſe which are moſt eaſie and perſpicuous. Which thing in reaſon will beſtow that good and benefit upon the learners, which will profit them all the time of their life, and be a commendation and ornament to them, ſo as from thence they may contract to themſelves a fair, neat, ingenuous, pure and eaſie Latine ſtile; not an obſcure, intricate, crooked, perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and uneven one, and ſuch as the moſt of the younger ſort contract to themſelves through the fault of their firſt and bad teaching while they are under their hate Maſters commanded to draw at their own skill and diſcretion the liquor of the Latine Tongue out of impure rivulets and ciſterns. And for the collecting eaſily, and without any great toil theſe which I have ſpoke of, brief and perſpicuous Sentences, in which well nigh all the parts, voices, words, nouns, verbs and termes of the Latine Tongue are comprehended and conteined, there is indeed a very large field ſet open Hither may be referred Theological Aphoriſmes, and brief and notable Sentences taken out of either Teſtament, and that out of the beſt and Latine verſion ſuch as theſe out of the Old: <hi>Creavit Deus hominem ad imaginem ſuam,</hi> God created man after his own image; <hi>Non eſt bonum hominum ſolum eſſe,</hi> It is not good for man to be alone; <hi>Pulvis, &amp; in pulverem rever<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

Of which like Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences there is very fair and moſt clear plenty in the Hiſtory of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and in the Epiſtles of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> Alſo the Hiſtories of the Old and New Teſtament reduced in a few words into a conciſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous Sentence: As <hi>Deus die ſeptimo quievit ab omni opere ſuo,</hi> God reſted the ſeventh day from all his work; <hi>Deus condidit Evam è coſta viri Adami, &amp;c,</hi> God made <hi>Eve</hi> out of the man <hi>Adams</hi> rib, &amp;c. Alſo out of the New, <hi>Magi ab Oriente venerunt Hieroſolymam,</hi> Wiſe men came from the Eaſt to Jeruſalem; <hi>Magi obtulerunt Chriſto nato curum, thus,

Alſo brief and witty common Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; <hi>Suſtine &amp; abſtine,</hi> Bear and forbear; <hi>Ferendum &amp; ſperandum.</hi> We muſt endure and hope; <hi>Patior ut potiar,</hi> I ſuſtain to obtain. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe out of Latine Authors, <hi>Quò ſe fortuna, eodem favor hominum inclinat,</hi> The favour of men inclines the ſame way which Fortune doth; <hi>Vita ſine literis mors eſt,</hi> An illiterate life is no other then death; <hi>Nemo niſi à ſcipſo laeditur,</hi> Every ones miſchief is from himſelf; <hi>Unus quiſque ſuae for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunae faber eſt,</hi> Every one's the contriver of his own fortune; <hi>Qui vult dicere quae vult, audiet quae non vult,</hi> He who ſpeaks what he will, ſhall hear what he would not; <hi>Famam multi, conſcientiam pauci verentur,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fear fame, few conſcience; <hi>Sic vive cum hominibus tanquam Deus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat, ſic loquere cum Deo tanquam homines audiant,</hi> Live ſo with men as God ſaw thee, ſpeak ſo with God as men heard thee; <hi>Altiſſima ſtumina minimo labuntur ſono,</hi> The deepeſt river makes the leaſt noiſe. Alſo all the moſt choice and memorable verſes out of the Poets, as <hi>Hemiſticks, Omne ſolum forti Patriaeſt,</hi> Each ſoil is the valiant mans Countrey; <hi>Non omnis fert omnia tellus,</hi> No ground brings ſorth all things; <hi>Non omnia poſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus omnes,</hi> There's none good at every thing; <hi>Nocet empta dolore voluptas,</hi> We like not pleaſure which is bought with grief.

Alſo all the choice ones of <hi>Mimus; Ab alio ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectes, alteri quod feceris,</hi> That which thou doeſt to one, expect that from another. There may be likewiſe other Sentences added taken out of the common life of men, yet with ſuch choice are they to be made uſe of, that they be both Latine, and withall eaſie. As, <hi>Rectè faciendo neminem

And leſt any one ſhould think Grammar to be waved in ſuch teaching, that ſhall be taught not in Precepts, but in Examples: this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be uſed in diſpoſing theſe, that we go through all the Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Numbers, and Caſes: As in the firſt Declenſion, <hi>Dignum laude virum Muſa vetat mori,</hi> Poetry preſerves a worthy man from the death of oblivion: In the Genitive caſe, <hi>Vitae ſumma brevis ſpem nos vetat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choare longam,</hi> The brevity of our life may check the length of our hope: In the Dative and Ablative, <hi>Lis eſt cum forma magna pudicitiae,</hi> There's a great ſtrife between beauty and chaſtity: In the Accuſative, <hi>Barbam vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo, Philoſophum non video,</hi> I ſee gravity, but no Philoſophy. Now in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch as theſe in ſuch plenty of Authours there can be no difficulty. We may travel through all Verbs, and their Moods, Tenſes, and Perſons: As, <hi>Non amote Numici, nec poſſum dicere quare,</hi> I do not love thee <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> nor can I give any reaſon why I do not; <hi>Fruſtrà ploras, quod recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perare non potes,</hi> In vain thou deploreſt for that which thou canſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; <hi>Bis dat qui citò dat,</hi> He gives a thing twice who gives it quickly. And eſpecially let ſuch examples be ſelected in Verbs, in which the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terperfect tenſe of the Verbs may be expreſſed: As, <hi>Pauci quos aequus amavit Jupiter, At<expan>
                     <am>

We may travel through all the Rules of the <hi>Syutax:</hi> As in the firſt Rule, <hi>Mali corvi malum ovum eſt,</hi> An ill bird layes an ill egge; <hi>Vir bonus &amp; malafortuna plerum<expan>

Through all Genders, Numbers, and Caſes. After the ſame manner all the other Rules may be propounded, all the precepts being removed, unleſſe it be in the examples, and we may proceed through all variety of conſtruction, of the Noun, Pronoun, Verb, Participle, Adverb, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, Prepoſition, Interjection, that no kinde of plain or figurative conſtruction may be left out. And for this uſe there ought not onely to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61230:24"/>
be gathered, as hath been ſaid, out of the Holy Scripture, and either Teſtament and the Authours of the Latine Tongue, all moſt choice Phraſes of Speech, Formes and Sentences, in which may occur all the more common termes of the Latine Tongue, verbs, nouns, and words, not ſo much as any word left or omitted. In which, as in lively Examples, all the precepts of Grammar may be ſhewn, as in their uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>o which aim and end let there be heaped together termes and phraſes out of all matters, wherewith theſe Things which are any where to be met withall, in peace, or in war; in leiſure, or in buſineſſe may be expreſſed purely and in good Latine. Under which conſideration, there may be added likewiſe hither the Principles of <hi>Geometry</hi> of a <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oint, of a Line, of a <hi>Superficies,</hi> of a Body, of an Angle, of a Triangle, of a Quadrat, of a <hi>Trapezium,</hi> being common notions and the very firſt foundations of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick</hi> and <hi>Geometry,</hi> which children did formerly learn in <hi>Greece,</hi> and which things I have experienced by very Uſe, that boyes with us but of ſeven years of age could learn by the Figures running into their eyes. There may be added the Multiplications of ſingle Numbers in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which they call the Table of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> how many may be five times nine? ſeven times eight? nine times ſeven? &amp;c. which things by brief, pleaſant, and ridiculous Examples and Figures even painted, may be ſo exactly imprinted in the tender memory of that age, as no forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe afterward may blot them out or aboliſh them in the whole time of their life. To theſe there ſhould be added, and ſhewn to children all the circles in the Sphere, there ſhould be ſhewn them in the Celeſtial Globe all the Signes in Heaven of the Zodiack, Northern and Southern. In the Terreſtrial Globe, and in the Geographical Tables there ſhould be ſhewn them all the parts of the World, and the parts of parts. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall memory may likewiſe be added to theſe things handſomely; by the benefit whereof a boy of ſeven, or truly of eight years old may learn each Genealogy of Chriſt in <hi>Matthew &amp; Luke,</hi> to rehearſe it backward and forward, all the Signes in heaven, all the Names of the parts of the earth, being ſhewn to him in a Tab<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

yet it may be helped afterward by other Meanes and Wayes in thoſe things, to retein whoſe Order may be thought to be worth the while, and quit for coſt, that it may be laſting, and not eaſily be oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
            <p>Now here it may be demanded, in what Order ſhould theſe Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be propounded to boyes in Schools? And indeed the matter it ſelf and reaſon teaches us, that Sentences taken out of Holy Scripture, and the Fathers do challenge to themſelves the former place. In the <hi>interim,</hi> as I would have nothing in the whole Univerſity of the Latine Tongue to be baulked or over-paſſed, which may not be produc'd once or twice in the uſe of Latine ſpeech: ſo for the order, I think, we ought not to be greatly ſolicitous. For the very variety of Things, in which ſacred ſhall be put with wordly, ſweet with profitable, ſerious matters with jeſting, yet honeſt, and wholly remote from all filthineſſe and obſcenity, will ſhake off from boyes all weariſomneſſe of learning, and will render them more prompt and expedite of thinking or ſpeaking ought concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any buſineſſe propounded in any place and time. In which thing I ſhall nevertheleſſe willingly follow the judgements of the more learned. Yea moreover, the very uſe of this teaching and exerciſe, as the Miſtris of all theſe things, vvill perfectly teach, what order it may be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to hold.</p>
            <p>And by this means it will come to paſſe at length, that they may be learned in all the parts, terms, nouns, verbs, words, and even in the leaſt particles of the Latine Tongue. And who in ſound reaſon can ever come to theſe, vvho after the Precepts of Grammar, in vvhich for ſo many years boyes are deteined, as it vvere in bonds and fetters, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound at laſt ſome Author of the Latine Tongue, and in exacting of that according to the Precepts of Grammar ſtay oftentimes a year or two, and detain their Scholars; as for example, <hi>Tulli<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">

Beſides there are to be met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in theſe onely a few termes and words, nor is there contained in them all the variety of the phraſes of the Latine ſpeech. For theſe Authors writ of ſome certain matter propounded to them, not out of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that they might teach boyes in Schools the Roman Tongue, or that they might expreſs in theſe their writings all the variety and plenty of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61230:25"/>
the Roman Tongue. Theſe Authours when ſtriplings or youths have in Schools ſcarce lightly taſted, they are by and by admitted to Arts and Faculties. And indeed many excellent things for the Latine Tongue may be learned out of theſe Authours, but not by Childrens age, nor in that manner and order. And hence it comes to paſſe, that when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in Schools have learned after a ſort the Principles of Latine ſpeech out of theſe Authours of the Latine Tongue, and afterwards ſcarcely or at leaſt ſlightly touch other Authours of the Latine Tongue, but forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with betake themſelves to Arts and Faculties, there is that ſcantineſſe and lack of the Latine ſpeech in many, ſo as if they meet with any leſſe frequent or more unuſual Thing to be expreſſed in Latine ſpeech, phraſe, or term, which may not be found in thoſe little Authours, which they have read and learned, they are quite at a ſtand, they ſcratch their head, bite the nail, and are not able to unfold themſelves, or at the leaſt they ſlyridiculouſly to general and common, or neighbour words, which are more known, not ſignifying this but another thing.</p>
            <p>I therefore am altogether of opinion, that theſe Exerciſes &amp; Eſſayes be premiſed out of ſuch a Book as may be called as it were <hi>Pandects</hi> of the Latine Tongue, before they be put to thoſe further Exerciſes of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Arguments, as they call them, in which they are enjoyned to turn Dutch into Latine, and admitted to hear, and preſently after to read Latine, Romane Authours. And theſe being premiſed, at length Latine Authours are to be propounded to them, yet ſo as they may be, without uſing any Dictates or Precepts explained to them in a plain and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous interpretation; and ſo as they may be diſpatched in as little a ſpace of time as may be, that afterwards even divers others may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. For I ſpeak of the teaching of boyes in the Latine Tongue, not of the teaching of young men who are more advanced, to whom the exerciſe of Logick or Rhetorick is ſhewn in Authours, which things neither may nor ought to be propounded to boyes.</p>
            <p>And theſe things touching this Firſt Way and Courſe, which ſeems may be laid for boys and youths to learn the Latine Tongue, I have been minded to ſet forth briefly, being about to reſerve in the mean while for another place and time many and choiſer other things, which the nature of this Epiſtle doth not admit; If I ſhall underſtand, that theſe things which I have been willing to ſhadow forth out of a good intent, and to write with the right hand, ſhall not be received with the left hand, or be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61230:25"/>
rejected and exploded. Now concerning that other moſt expedite and certain Way of learning the Latine Tongue, I ſhall ſay little or nothing here. Becauſe that although it would be in it ſelf the leaſt of all pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet it may ſeem rather to be wiſhed for then to be obtained, that, what ought to have been done long ſince many ages ago, may in this laſt age of the world be excited and ſet afoot by ſome revived <hi>Charlemain,</hi> or Great Patron and Parent of Learning and learned men; to wit, that the Latine Tongue might be ſo learned, as the Greeks, Hebrews, Germanes, Vandals and Scythians learned it in former times; by going namely to <hi>Rome,</hi> and into <hi>Italy,</hi> at that time, when as yet they uſed it pure and Roman. That, I ſay, it might be learned without any native and mother-tongue, by meer Cuſtome, Converſe, and Uſe, with thoſe who could ſpeak the Latine and Roman Tongue very purely and readily. And becauſe ſuch a Place where they ſpeak in this ſort the Romane Tongue onely, is not found in the world, it ſhould be provided by Art.</p>
            <p>This Way though it would be the moſt expedite and certain in it ſelf, yet far ſooner and eaſier, and with leſſe coſt and proviſion might all things neceſſary for this buſineſſe be procured, then any one will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. If ſo be ſome Emperour or King, yea even ſome Prince or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in any Common-wealth, would in this age vouchſafe to light a taper or torch; for the ſtudies of Learning &amp; the Tongues being a dying, and almoſt extinct, and raiſe and revoke from death and Hell not the Latine onely, but alſo the Greek and Hebrew, and other bordering Tongues, not onely ſo profitable and neceſſary for Empires, Kingdoms, Principalities, and Common-wealths, but alſo for the ſick and already dying Church of God. Now how ſmall a thing were it, conſidering this ſo profitable a buſineſſe, to ſet up in Principalities or Kingdomes a <hi>Coeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium,</hi> Colledge, or Place ſuitable hereunto. How ſmall a thing were it to call forth to ſuch places by good ſtipends, Worthy men, and ſuch as are very skilful in the Latine Tongue, who ſhould uſe onely the Latine Tongue, and that indeed pure and Roman, and ſhould be compelled to this very thing by certain and ſevere Orders. Nor they themſelves onely, but alſo their Servants &amp; Attendants, and as they uſe to ſay, the Scullions in the Kitchin. I doubt not but theſe things are like to be taught at by many, and perhaps never to be aſſayed by any one, which nevertheleſſe none can deny to be be certain and eaſie, but he who forſwears Wit and Reaſon. For although it may ſeem to be hard and difficult to get ſuch
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61230:26"/>
Men, Servants, Miniſters, and other things which may be requiſite for this matter; nevertheleſſe, if even indifferent ſtipends be ſet for each of them; yea indeed, if ſome who are not unfit for this purpoſe, ſhall but be able to maintain themſelves, or have a lively-hood from thence, all this difficulty may be eaſily overcome. And there may be choſen to this purpoſe not onely moſt excellent Men, and ſuch as are moſt skilful of the Roman Language, who would be Preſidents, Rectors and Governours in ſuch a place, as in ſome Romane Colony. But alſo Students accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and fit for that buſineſſe, who would perform thoſe inferiour offices. Boys and ſtriplings might be ſent hither as into a <hi>Forum; Romanum.</hi> Who if they were altogether ignorant of the Latine Tongue, at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance the beginning thereof would be a little harder, and more time would be required to learn it, yet not above the ſpace of two years, as I verily perſwade my ſelf. But if by ſuch exerciſes and Eſſayes, of which I have ſpoken largely before, one might be brought to the firſt entries and portals of the Latine Tongue (which might be done within two years) one might be brought within a years ſpace to the full Uſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Latine Speech, about ten or however eleven years of age, to that knowledge of the Latine Tongue, that one might then read Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours with profit, and then give ones minde to other Tongues, and by and by to Arts and Faculties. And it might be wiſhed that thoſe boyes who ſhould be ſeaſoned with the Fundamentalls and Principles of the Latine ſpeech in that Way, which I have formerly explained, ſhould be preſently entertained by ſuch a <hi>Coenobium</hi> or Community, in which there might be onely the moſt pure uſe of the Latine and Romane ſpeech, and ſhould be exerciſed in it for a year or two. Yet althought this later Way of which I have now begun to ſpeak, might be ſufficient for them to learn the Latine Tongue, and might within the ſpace of two years, or not much more, diſmiſſe one not ignorant of the Latine Speech. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, that former Way, which conſiſts of the Pictures of all viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Things, and of Sentences added to the ſame, might even here be profitably uſed; ſo that it might be diſpatched by the Latine Tongue alone, to which as the one and onely Tongue this place ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, without any Dutch as Interpreter, which ſhould be utterly ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of this place. Now what exerciſes might be inſtituted by alternate courſes in ſuch a Roman Colony, Sacred, Serious, Sportive, and agreeable to ingenuous Children, by which they might learn to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61230:26"/>
in the Latine or Roman ſpeech whatſoever ſhall occur in all the names, terms, words, phraſes and formes thereof, and in all the parts of a Mans life, and concerning what matters of humane life they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the meaning of the minde in pure Latine Language, I do not adde here. Well near all thoſe things which may ſeem to abſolve this whole buſineſſe, have been meditated by me long ſince, and might be ſet out, if God ſhould by any hap vouchſafe to excite a King, Prince, or Magiſtrate, by whom he might deign to begin and compleat a Work ſo laudable and profitable to Mankinde, &amp; in it to the diſtreſſed Church of God, and all the parts of the Common-wealth, and of mens whole life; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: but theſe are but wiſhes. Indeed I am confident by Gods grace, and verily perſwaded of this; if ſuch a Romane Colonie, as I may term it, were ſet up, that the Roman Tongue might be learned in it, no leſſe quickly, and perhaps no leſſe certainly and fully, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the midſt of <hi>Suburra</hi> or <hi>Forum Romanum.</hi> For as they who came out of <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> or other parts of the world unto <hi>Rome</hi> to learn the Latine Tongue might there forthwith by Cuſtome and daily Uſe learn as much as could be to expreſſe and utter vulgar Things, and ſuch as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur daily in common life: nevertheleſſe, there did not occur there all the parts of a mans other life to be expreſſed in their termes, formes, and Roman phraſes. But all theſe things might by ſome certain exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes appointed hereunto, be learned in ſuch a Colony as I have ſpoken of more fully and copiouſly. That ſo there might after two or at the moſt three years, be ſent forth, out of this Roman Colony, ſuch as might declare promptly and readily in the Latine and Romane ſpeech the thoughts and meditations of their minde touching all things which occur in mans life in peace or war, in vacancy or employment. But if this might be done, as by Gods help, I am verily perſwaded, in a ſhort inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of time, that ought to be reputed and taken as a matter of vantage. Theſe things, moſt Illuſtrious Prince, I thought good by occaſion of this Epiſtle, to expoſe to your Highneſſe, which I could wiſh were ſuch, as might not diſpleaſe it, which likes onely the beſt! I could wiſh alſo that others would accept of them in that manner as they come from me. Whatſoever it may be, I have been willing to provide for Children that they might be brought ſooner and more maturely then hitherto to thoſe ſtudies of wiſdome, and principally, to that true and eternal wiſdome Chriſt Jeſus, who bids Children come unto him, and ſaith expreſly, <hi>That
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61230:27"/>
theirs is the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> And that I might be helpful to theſe, I have been willing to ſet forth this New Edition of the New Teſtament, whoſe former part I now publiſh. To wit, from whence Children might learn the Latine, and ſtraightway being ſtriplings, the Greek Tongue. Yea, the very comparing of the Tongues wil not haply be unprofitable to Divines &amp; learned men. I have faithfully reteined the Dutch Tranſlation of <hi>Luther,</hi> to which I have been forced ſometimes to miſplace the Greek Text; and that with this intent, that I might accommodate theſe things to Children. In which matter, ſuch as are more skilful in the Greek Language ſhall pardon me, as alſo in many other things, which I could not eaſily avoid in this my Deſigne. I with reverence beſeech your Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Highneſſe to take theſe things, ſuch as they be, in good worth, and to reckon me among yours ſtill</p>

               <hi>THE True and Ready Way to learn the Latine Tongue: Expreſſed in an Anſwer to a</hi> Quere, Whether the ordinary Way of teaching Latine by the Rules of Grammar, be the beſt Way for youths to learn it? <hi>By the late Learned and Judicious Gentleman Mr.</hi> Richard Carew <hi>of</hi> Anthony <hi>in</hi> Cornwall.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my tender youth I was by my Father put to School, and ſo continued for nine or ten years to learn Latine accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common teaching of ordinary Schoolmaſters, by the Rules of <hi>Lillies</hi> Grammar. Afterward I ſpent three years in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and three years more in the Middle Temple, one of our Innes of Court. From thence I was ſent with mine Uncle in his Ambaſſage beyond the Seas, unto the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> whom when we came to <hi>Dantzig,</hi> we found to have been newly gone from thence into <hi>Sweden,</hi> whither alſo we went after him; and in this journey, wanting the native Language of thoſe Countreys, I was often inforced to uſe the help of the Latine Tongue, to buy ſuch things as we needed, and to conferre with many Perſons, being often imployed by mine Uncles direction, to deliver Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and receive Anſwers both to and from many great perſons of the Dutch, Swediſh and Poliſh Nations. And therein found a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the want of uſuall talking in former time in the Latine Tongue; becauſe I had often occaſion to call for ſuch things, and at other times to mention ſuch things as we did ſeldome or never meet with the names
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61230:28"/>
of the ſame in our Books. After my return and ſhort ſtaying here I was ſent by my Father into <hi>France</hi> with Sir <hi>Henry-Nevill,</hi> who was then Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour Leiger unto <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, that there I might learn the French Tongue, which Language, though it ſeemed very hard to me in the beginning, becauſe mine ignorante made me unable to diſtinguiſh one word from another, and ſo imagine that thoſe people uſed to talk much faſter then we did, in a little time, when by often-hearing their talk, I began to diſcern the diſtance of one word from another, I found they uſed to talk rather more deliberately then we do; and ſo by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and talking, I learn'd more French in three quarters of a year then I had done Latine in above thirteen; wherein though I will not deny but the Uſe of my Latine Grammar did ſomething help me to make me the better apprehend the Coherence of ſpeech, yet I have ever ſince concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, upon my learning by practice, that uſuall Talking, and much Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Reading open a ſurer and readier Way to attain any Tongue, then the tedious courſe which is uſed in the Latine by conſtruing and pearſing according to the Rules of Grammar, in obſerving of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Gender, Caſe, and Declenſion of all variable words; partly becauſe ſo much time is ſpent in the declination of every word, according to the Formes ſet down in the Grammar; and partly in the over-loading of the weak wits of youths with ſuch a multitude of ordinary Rules, and ſuch a world of Exceptions in particular words, as are acknowledged to differ from the generall Rules, as is able to confound both the Memory and Underſtanding of men of years; beſides, the hard gnawing of the dry bones which are able to tire their jawes, and take away the edge of their teeth, before they can break them into ſuch pieces, as will be fit for their weak ſtomacks, becauſe after the Grammar-faſhion they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to transform them into ſo many ſeveral ſhapes, as Art can deviſe to turn them into, and yet all this while they gain the knowledge of the ſenſe but of one word, whereas the Underſtanding of a Language, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the knowledge of the ſenſe of all; and by the way which I ſhew not onely the knowledge of many words, but of many ſentences, are learn'd with delight, in giving light to the underſtanding, by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Authours, which have left their Works for the bettering of the knowledge of the after-ages, by the experience of their times. And at laſt there is more learn'd by the practice of Reading, then there was in the long School-teaching. Theſe and many other things have made
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61230:28"/>
me a little to look after the Naturall Courſe of Learning, divers Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and ſo I finde that Languages were not firſt deviſed by the Rules of Grammar, but the Rules of Grammar were framed according to the common practice of Speech, which when in many Words and Phraſes the particulars differ from the generall, they make up a huge number of Exceptions. And that we finde after the tongue hath inabled boys and girles to pronounce the words they hear, a few years practice makes their tongues run nimbly away with any thing they deſire to ſay, and as quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend what they hear, and that with leſſe offence to <hi>Priſcian,</hi> and leſſe ſtudy, though ſometimes by miſchance they break his head, yet leſſe and ſeldomer then great Clerks do in other Languages. Becauſe Common Uſe teacheth them a ſpeedier meaſure by their practice then line and levell could do. Beſides, I finde a great difference in the very naturall framing of the Languages, for in our Engliſh tongue a word miſplaced alters the ſence exceedingly, as every one conceives the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a horſe-mill and a mill-horſe, which is not ſo in Latine, and the Verb in Latine is ſeldome joyned with the ſame word we do in Engliſh, and the Adjective commonly followes the Subſtantive, whereas we commonly put him before the ſame, and ſay (a good man) they ſay (a man good;) and in common talk one word ſerves inſtead of a Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to help the underſtanding of another. By which reaſon mine own Father learn'd of himſelf by continuall Reading, the Greek, Dutch, French, Italian and Spaniſh Tongues, onely by Reading, without any other teaching: And it is a thing plainly obſerved by a multitude of perſons who never learnt the Rules of Grammar, what Errors Forreigners commit, as well in miſtaking their words, as in their undue pronouncing of them, and will aſſoon ſhew their Errors, as if they had been direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Grammar. I have alſo conferred with many Gentlemen, who (having learn'd Grammar by Rule, and forreign Languages by roat) have likewiſe acknowledged, how much more they profited by practice then by precept, and likewiſe how much worſe it ſped with thoſe who followed the Grammar Rules of thoſe forreign Tongues, then with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who neglected them, and plied the practice of ſpeech. I could wiſh therefore that, when Children are firſt taught the Grammar, inſtead of that, they were employed in much Reading and Writing, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Latine Books into Engliſh, and returning the ſame back again into Latine; whereby they ſhould in that waſted time of their youth,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61230:29"/>
gain the knowledge of many good Authours which they could not have time to read, and which by their dulneſs in learning the Rules of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, they are ſo tired with the difficulty thereof, that they conceive an impoſſibility ever to attain it, and ſo quit it, though they prove men of excellent Underſtanding when they come to ripeneſſe of age. And the Romans as ordinarily both men, women, and children aſſoon learn'd and ſpeak Latine, as Engliſh, French, Dutch, Welſh, and Iriſh, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations do their Native Tongues. I have likewiſe found by practice the ſame effect, but have been beaten out of it by the arrogant, ignorant, and obſtinate contradiction of too many others; as I was likewiſe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by that I was not able to follow it my ſelf, as I ſhould have done, neither am I ſo fooliſh as to reject Grammar, but would onely have it taught (according to the nobleneſſe thereof, as one of the ſeven Liberall Sciences) to perſons, who by ripeneſs of Underſtanding are able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Reaſons thereof, and have known ſome apter to learn in their youth the Rules of Logick and Rhetorick, then thoſe of Grammar (though they greedily deſired it) which courſe if it were taken, I think would make many of our Engliſh Gentry prove Scholars, which by the ordinaryway could never learn it. And the help preſcribed by the Gramar Rules, how to put the Nominative Caſe before the Verb, the Accuſative after, and to joyn the Subſtantive with the Adjective; and the ordering of every word, according to our Engliſh faſhion, may be far more eaſily directed by placing figures of Number to expreſſe their order, and by this means ſcarce any who go to School, ſhall ever miſſe the writing of a good and ſwift hand, and attain ten times more knowledge by reading ſo many wiſe Authours as have left their writings for the inſtruction of poſterity, by their diligent obſervation of the meanes and fruits which ſhew men to follow good, and avoid ill Actions. And I hold it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very neceſſary for every Teacher to be as diligent in obſerving the exceeding different nature of all their Scholars, according to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of their perſons and age, rather then according to their common Rules; for ſome can learn the ſame thing better at ſeven then others at fourteen; and yet thoſe at the fourteen years end will many times over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and out-go the ſame perſons, who ſo much out-went them before. And by this way their time cannot be loſt, for I take Learning to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to teach knowledge, that knowledge by practice may inable men
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61230:29"/>
by noble Actions to give glory to God, and to do as much good as they can, during the courſe of their whole lives.</p>

Yet can no man ſay, but that to ſpeak well, is moſt gratious and commendable, but not ſo excell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as ſome make it: and I am grieved to ſee how we imploy moſt part of our time about that onely. I would firſt know mine owne tongue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, then my neighbours with whom I have moſt commerce. I muſt needs acknowledge, that the Greeke and Latine tongues, are great orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a Gentleman, but they are purchaſed at over-high a rate. Vſe it who liſt, I will tell you how they may be gotten better cheap, and much ſooner then is ordinarily vſed, which was tried in my ſelfe. My late Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, having by all the meanes and induſtrie, that is poſſible for man, ſought amongſt the wiſeſt, and men of beſt vnderſtanding, to find a moſt exquiſite and readie way of teaching, being adviſed of the inconvenien cies then in uſe; was given to underſtand, that the lingring while, and beſt part of our youth, that we imploy in learning the tongues, which coſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61230:30"/>
them nothing, is the onely cauſe we can never attain to that abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of skill and knowledg of the Greeks &amp; Romanes. I do not believe that to be the onely cauſe. But ſo it is, the expedient my Father found out, was this; that being yet at nurce, &amp; before the firſt looſing of my tongue, I was delivered to a Germaine (who died ſince, a moſt excellent Phiſitian in <hi>France)</hi> he being then altogether ignorant of the French tongue, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely readie and skilfull in the Latine. This man, whom my Father had ſent for of purpoſe, and to whome he gave very great entertainment, had me continually in his armes, and was mine onely overſeer. There were alſo joined unto him two of his countrimen, but not ſo learned; whoſe charge was to attend, and now and then to play with me; and all theſe together did never entertain me with other then the Latine tongue. As for others of his houſhold, it was aninviolable rule, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelfe, nor my mother, nor man, not maid ſervant, were ſuffered to ſpeake one word in my companie, except ſuch Latine words, as every one had learned to chat and pratle with me, It were ſtrange to tell how every one in the houſe profited therein. My Father and my Mother learned ſo much Latine, that for a neede they could underſtand it, when they heard it ſpoken, even ſo did all the houſhold ſervants, namely ſuch as were neereſt and moſt about me. To be ſhort, we were all ſo Latini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, that the townes round about us had their ſhare of it; inſomuch as even at this day, many Latine names both of workmen and of their tooles, are yet in uſe among them. And as for my ſelfe, I was about ſix years old, &amp; could underſtand no more French or Perigordine, then Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bike, and that with out art, without books, rules or grammer, without whipping or whining. I had gotten as pure a Latine tongue as my Maſter could ſpeake; the rather becauſe I could neither mingle or confound the ſame with other tongues. If for an Eſſay they would give me a Theame, whereas the faſhion in Colledges is, to give it in French, I had it in bad Latine, to reduce the ſame into good. And <hi>Nicholas Grucchi,</hi> who hath written, <hi>De comitiis Romanorum; William Guerenti,</hi> who hath commented <hi>Ariſtotle: George Buchanan,</hi> that famous Scottiſh Poet, and <hi>Marke-Antonie Muret,</hi> whom (while he lived) both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italie</hi> to this day, acknowledge to have been the beſt Oratour: (all which have been my familiar tutors) have often told me, that in mine infancy I had the Latine tongue ſo ready and ſo perfect, that themſelves feared to take me in hand. And <hi>Buchanan,</hi> whom afterward I ſaw attending on the Marſhall of <hi>Briſſacke,</hi> told me, he was about to write a Treatiſe of

the Inſtitution of Children, and that he took the modell and pattern from mine: for at that time he had the charge and bringing up of the young Earl of <hi>Briſſack,</hi> whom ſince we have ſeen prove ſo worthy and ſo valiant a Captain. As for the Greek, wherein I have but ſmall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, my Father purpoſed to make me learn it by art; But by new and unaccuſtomed meanes, that is, by way of recreation and exerciſe. We did toſſe our declinations and conjugations to and fro, as they do, who by way of a certain game at Tables learn both <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Geometry.</hi> For amongſt other things he had eſpecially been perſwaded to make me taſt and apprehend the fruits of Duty and Science by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced kinde of will, and of mine own choice; and without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion or rigour to bring me up in all mildeneſſe and liberty; yea, with ſuch kinde of ſuperſtition, that, whereas ſome are of opinion, that ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to awaken young children, and as it were by violence to ſtartle and fright them out of their dead ſleep in a morning, (wherein they are more heavy and deeper plunged then we) doth greatly trouble and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper their braines, he would every morning cauſe me to be awakened by the ſound of ſome Inſtrument; and I was never without a ſervant who to that purpoſe attended upon me. This example may ſerve to judge of the reſt; as alſo to commend the judgement and tender affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſo careful and loving a father; who is not to be blamed, though he reaped not the fruits anſwerable to his exquiſite toil, and painful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring. Two things hindered the ſame; firſt, the barreneſſe and unfit ſoil: for howbeit I were of a ſound and ſtrong conſtitution, and of a tractable and yielding condition, yet was I ſo heavy, ſo ſluggiſh, and ſo dull, that I could not be rouzed (yea were it to go to play) from out mine idle drowzineſſe. What I ſaw, I ſaw it perfectly; and under this heavy, and as it were, Lethe-complexion did I breed hardie imaginations, and opinions far above my years: My ſpirit was very ſlow, and would go no further then it was led by others; my apprehenſion blockiſh, my invention poor; and beſides, I had a marvellous defect in my weak me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: it is therefore no wonder, if my father could never bring me to any perfection. Secondly, as thoſe that in ſome dangerous ſickneſſe moved with a kinde of hopefull and greedy deſire of perfect health a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, give ear to every Leache or Empirick, and follow all counſels, the good man being exceedingly fearfull to commit any overſight in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he took ſo to heart, ſuffered himſelf at laſt to be led away by the

common opinion, which like unto the Cranes followeth ever thoſe that go before, and yielded to cuſtome: Having thoſe no longer about him that had given him his firſt directions, and which they had brought out of <hi>Italie.</hi> Being but ſix years old, I was ſent to the Colledge of <hi>Guienne</hi> then moſt flouriſhing and reputed the beſt in <hi>France,</hi> where it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to adde any thing to the great care he had, both to chuſe the beſt and moſt ſufficient Maſters that could be found to read unto me, as alſo for all other circumſtances pertaining to my education, wherein contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to uſuall cuſtomes of Colledges, he obſerved many particular rules. But ſo it is, it was ever a Colledge. My Latine Tongue was forthwith corrupted, whereof by reaſon of diſcontinuance, I afterward loſt all manner of uſe: which new kinde of inſtitution ſtood me in no other ſtead, but that at my firſt admittance, it made me to over-skip ſome of the lower formes, and to be placed in the higheſt. For at thirteen years of age, that I left the Colledge, I had read over the whole courſe of Philoſophy (as they call it) but with ſo ſmall profit, that I can now make no account of it. The firſt taſte or feeling I had of Books was of the pleaſure I took in reading the fables of <hi>Ovids</hi> Metamorphoſies; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſeven or eight years old, I would ſteal and ſequeſter my ſelf from all other delights, onely to read them: Forſomuch as the tongue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were written was to me naturall; and it was the eaſieſt book I knew, and by reaſon of the matter therein contained, moſt agreeing with my yong age. For of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> of <hi>Lancelot du Luke,</hi> of <hi>Amadis,</hi> of <hi>Huon,</hi> of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and ſuch idle time-conſuming, and wit-beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting traſh of Books, wherein youth doth commonly ammuſe it ſelf, I was not ſo much as acquainted with their names, and to this day know not their bodies, nor what they contain: So exact was my Diſcipline, &amp;c.</p>
