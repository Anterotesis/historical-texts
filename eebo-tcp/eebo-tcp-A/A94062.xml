            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:119063:3"/>
of Juſtice at <hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> the houſe of God, was become a <hi>Bethanes,</hi> the houſe of lies. What violent adventures have been made by many of this Nations own degenerate Sons to break the ſtaffe of beanty, I need not tell you; I fear the next generation will ſcarce live to ſee Religion healed of ſome of theſe ſcars and wounds ſhe hath received in our late unhappy wars, of which, oh may ſhe not complain in the Prophets words, that ſhe hath been wounded in the houſe of her friends: The quarrel begun with Religion, but ended againſt policy:<note place="margin">Zac. 13. 6.</note> Thoſe that are burthened by the Goſpel, can live without the Law; <hi>Sine Fide, ſine Rege, ſine Lege.</hi> The ſtaff of bonds hath of late had its turn, and had not both been held in the hand of a ſtrong God, ſure the iſſue ere this had been confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>My Lords, That both Juſtice and Religion finds yet the countenance of ſo egregious Patrons as your ſelves, is a Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Achor,</hi> a door of hope to our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that we ſhall once more ſee <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when truth buds out of the earth, and righteouſneſſe looks down from heaven, then<note place="margin">Pſa 85. 11, 12.</note> have we ground to hope that our Land alſo ſhall give her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
            <p>What evidence have you given the world, not only of your integrity in doing Juſtice, but alſo of your zeal to Religion? This makes your name which you have left behind you, like a ſweet perfume. Not to flatter you ('twas but your duty) how often to provoke others of quality to imitate your Religious practiſe, have I mentioned, that joy that poſſeſt me to ſee a Judge ſo conſtant and ſerious in writing Sermon notes; like thoſe Noble <hi>Berians, Acts 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two ſhort Sermons following, however eſteemed by your Honors, and others, had never ſeen more light then came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Study window, had I known how elſe to have ſatisfied the earneſt importunities of many Gentlemen, and others, that
<pb facs="tcp:119063:3"/>
were my Auditors; but beyond all, the joynt deſire of your Lordſhips, was of ſufficient authority to make me conſent; this liberty only I muſt crave, when there was one only deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to preſent you with two: They are both of the ſame mould, and like <hi>Ruth</hi> and <hi>Naomi,</hi> they are reſolved to go together. What may be the cenſure of others (though I am ſure to have my back-burden) doth very little trouble me: The Smith's Dog (they ſay) doth not fear the fire; it hath been my lot for ſome years, beyond many of my place, to be exerciſed by a generation, whoſe inward parts is very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, and their throat an open Sepulchre; ſo that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">Anabapt.

What e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the welcome that this weak Eſſay finds among others, yet I am ſure wiſdome is ſtill juſtified by all her children.</p>
            <p>To your Honors then, and the reſt of the Gentlemen, whoſe deſire I have gratified by this impreſſion, I humbly inſcribe theſe weak conceptions of mine. And oh that God would once more make another impreſsion of them upon their hearts; and as he hath honoured you among his people, and advanced you above others in place, ſo may he make you all more eminent in piety; that having ſerved your generation in the ſeveral truſts committed to you awhile, you may cheerfully reſign your Offices, together with your Souls, and give up your accounts to him who ſhall come to judge quick and dead, at that laſt and great day.

            <p>2 <hi>Ut Munimentum.</hi> As <hi>Sampſons</hi> ſtrength lay in his Locks, ſo doth the ſtrength of a State in government: Juſtice was wont to be portraitured with a balance in one hand, and a ſword in the other; as with that ſhe weighs the caſe, ſo with this ſhe defends the guiltleſſe, and hate of the impious. For this too; Magiſtrates are called the ſhields of the earth, fencing and ſecuring their people,<note place="margin">Pſa. 47. 9.</note> as a ſhield doth the body. Once more, they are called the Corner-ſtone, <hi>Zac.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>Out of</hi> Juda <hi>ſhall come the</hi>

            <p>3 Juſtice exalts a Nation; <hi>ut Ornamentum:</hi> Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones do not only ſtrengthen, but alſo adorn the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they are more coſtly and curious then thoſe that lie by them; their Daughters ſhall be as corner-ſtones po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, after the ſimilitude of a Temple, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 144. 12.</p>
            <p>Beſides, they are called a Nail in <hi>Zac.</hi> 10. 4. Nailes do not only faſten and ſtrengthen, but they ſerve to hang things on. Do not think it ſtrange, that the glory of a Nation ſhould hang upon the nail of authority: When God promiſed to faſten <hi>Eliakim</hi> as a Nail in a ſure place, (that is, to eſtabliſh his government) 'tis added, and they ſhall hang upon him all the glory of his Fathers houſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 4.</p>
            <p>'Tis worth notice, that when the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> was in a vein of extolling the glory of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he commends her, among other things, as glorious for this, becauſe there were the Thrones of Judgement. Thus good Laws<note place="margin">Pſa. 122. 5.</note> well executed, are the bottom, beauty, and bullwork of a State, and it briefly teaches us;</p>
            <p>That Anabaptiſts and Libertines, as they are enemies<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> to the Church, ſo they are bad friends to a State; to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Lawes, and to deſtroy a Nation, are but the ſame thing in divers expreſſions: Thoſe ſatanized Monſters that deſpiſe government, and ſpeak evil of dignities, are ſuch as follow the fleſh in the luſts of uncleanneſſe, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10. Law is one of the greateſt enemies to luſt, two Maſters they are, that cannot be ſerved both,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119063:7"/>
but he that will leane to the one, muſt deſpiſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>A Lap.</hi> propoſes the Query, why <hi>Epicurus</hi> had more Diſciples than the reſt of the Phyloſophers; and he gives this anſwer; <hi>Non quod Diſciplina verum affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, ſed quod voluptate invitet;</hi> Liberty is a bait that luſt loves to bite at, and he that would catch the one, muſt angle with the other. Corruption could never endure to be bridled by Authority, but loves to run in a looſe rein: <hi>Elies</hi> ſons were firſt luſtful, and then diſobedient;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.</note> and ſtill do their impure off-ſpring decry Authority to foſter their impurity, every where voting down Lawes<note place="margin">Pſa. 12.</note> and Juſtice; as they in the <hi>Pſalm, Who is Lord over us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may learn nezt the neceſſity, both of Law and<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> Juſtice, and the miſery of a Nation that is without them. The <hi>Perſians</hi> had a cuſtome when their chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler died, there was among them, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe liberty for five daies after, ſo that every one might do for that five daies what he pleaſed. Now in this ſhort interval of government, there were ſuch murders; rapes, and robberies of all kinds committed, by the headleſſe multitude, that before the five daies were expired, they were exceeding glad to accept of a new Governour. Juſtice is the very pulſe of a State; and as we know the man's dead when his pulſe doth not beat; ſo in a Commonwealth, when Juſtice ceaſeth: The Prophet ſaw nothing but ſpoiling and violence, and the wicked compaſſing about the righteous; and why? <hi>Defluit Lex,</hi> the Law was diſſolved; no life any longer in the State, its pulſe had done beating, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
            <p>'Tis an obſervation of learned <hi>Weems,</hi> that ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary is Juſtice to the very being of a Commonwealth,<note place="margin">Hab 1. 4. <hi>Weems</hi> his Chriſtian Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue.</note> that no ſociety can ſubſiſt without it, even Thieves and Robbers could not long ſubſiſt, if every one had

not his ſhare, the whole Society muſt needs be diſſolved.<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Miſerable is that Nation where Juſtice is corrupted, that looks for judgement, and meet with oppreſſion, and for righteouſneſſe, but behold a cry; wrong judgement is worſe then no judgement: 'Tis ſad when judgement is turned into gall, and the fruit of righteouſneſſe into<note place="margin">Am. 6, 12.</note> hemlock, where ſhould a man look for juſtice, but where men profeſſe holineſſe: Yet this was the grievance of which the Preacher complains, <hi>Eccleſ. 3. 16. I ſaw under the Sun the place of Judgement, and behold, wickedneſſe was there; and the place of righteouſneſſe, and iniquity was there.</hi> Such corruptions gave <hi>Cato</hi> cauſe to complain of the Roman State, that private robbers lay in chains of iron, but publike thieves went in chains of gold. In ſhort, a people is then at their laſt caſt, when God finds not a man to do Juſtice among them, <hi>Jer. 5. 1. Run too and fro thorow the ſtreets of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and ſee, and know, and ſeek in the broad place thereof, if there be any that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuteth judgement, and ſeeketh truth, and I will ſpare it.</hi> The want of Juſtice upon earth, provokes God himſelf to do juſtice from heaven.</p>
            <p>Learn we next to prize this grand bleſſing; Juſtice<note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> executed by men is a mercy from God; ſince ſin enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the world, Juſtice is the remedy that God hath provided to purge corruption. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was none of the beſt Governours, yet a Cedar, under which the beaſts of the field found ſhadow, and the fowls of heaven dwelt under the boughs thereof; if a bad Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 9.</note> be ſo uſeful; what's the worth of a better? When the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> came to hear <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſhe made it<note place="margin">1 Kings 10. 9.</note> matter of her joy, and bleſſed God that he had ſet <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> on the throne of Iſrael; <hi>becauſe the Lord loved Iſrael for ever, therefore he made the King to do judgement and</hi>

               <hi>justice, 1 Kings</hi> 10. 9. Sure 'tis our happineſſe, had we hearts to acknowledge it, that we have juſtice weighed to us by the balance, when for ſin we might juſtly have expected to have ſeen it carved out to us by the ſword.</p>
            <p>Addreſſes it ſelf to you (Right Honourable) with the<note place="margin">Uſe 5.</note> reſt that are in authority, you ſee what's your duty, and the Countryes expectation, would you raiſe a poor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that's almoſt in the duſt; you ſee the way, and your duty lies ſomewhat more exactly deſcribed in <hi>Deut. 1. 16.

            </p>
            <p>Five things eſpecially are requiſite to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Magiſtrate, and they are briefly theſe.</p>
            <p>1 Wiſdome and Judgement to find out the truth; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are the eyes of a State, and if this light be darkneſſe, how great would the darkneſſe be; let us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<note place="margin">Zac. 11. 17.</note> deprecate that curſe that God juſtly once threatened Iſrael with; ſhepherds they ſhould have, and the ſword<note place="margin">Boni paſtores debent eſſe cent oculi ut ſe ipſos introſpici, aut &amp; alios curent, cui enim bonus qui ſibi nequam?

noble qualitie, yet they ſay, if a mandrake be ſet neere the Vine the grape is farre the more generous; Juſtice is a rare vertue in it ſelf, but if Religion be planted neere it, its farre the more admirable.

innocency eſcape the one, how uſually do they ſuffer by the other. Though a faithful witneſſe, I muſt confeſſe, as great a friend to truth, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> yet that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſifted, I doubt not but too often they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be handled as <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was examined with ſtripes.

            <p>1.

If a Magiſtrate will drink, or ſweare, or ſlight the Sabbath, who will not bear him company. As an eclipſe in the Sunne alwayes produceth ſome deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive effects upon inferiour bodies, ſo 'tis here, let a man of place be either good or bad, he is ſure to be exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: We read when <hi>Criſpus</hi> the chief Ruler of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue beleeved, many of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> beſide belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and were baptized with him, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 8. on the other ſide the Pſalmiſt could imagine no heavier curſe for his<note place="margin">Pſal 109. 6.</note> enemy then this, ſet you an ungodly man to be Ruler o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him.</p>
            <p>3. Meditate ſeriouſly whoſe work you are in. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells you, the weights of the bag are his work, <hi>Prov. 16. 11.

               </gap>, Gods Vicar, Deputy, or Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent.</p>
            <p>Several wayes this may be evidenced.</p>
            <p>1. They are commiſſioned by him not only Kings, but<note place="margin">Haec ſententia duo ſignificat. 1 Hanc poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem eſſe a Deo. 2 Reges vicem gerere Dei, &amp;c. <hi>A Lap. in loc.</hi>

By me Kings reigne, and Princes decree justice; by me Princes rule, and Nobles, and all Judges of the earth.</hi> God alone is the abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and hath the ſole ſovereignty of Heaven and Earth, and this power he delegates to Princes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119063:13"/>
and Rulers who governe for him.</p>
            <p>2. They act for him, and this will appeare two wayes.</p>
            <p>1. They are Gods Laws whereby they judge God himſelf preſcribed <hi>Iſrael</hi> her judicials, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. And he is ſupreme Logiſlator ſtill. Hence that prayer of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Give the King thy judgement, O Lord, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 72. 1, 2</note> 
               <hi>thy righteouſneſſe to the Kings Son,</hi> and then he doubts not when God has given him righteous Laws, and a righteous heart to execute them, but that he will prove a bleſſed Governour, <hi>Then ſhall he judge thy People in righteouſneſſe, and thy poore with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It's Gods ſentence (or ought to be) which they paſt; Though the King be but a man, yet 'tis a divine ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that is in his lips, and his mouth tranſgreſſeth not in judgement, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 10. Our old word Conning, and by contraction, King <hi>Becanus</hi> ſayes, comes from <hi>Con,</hi> which ſignifies three things, <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A few things briefly I ſhall inferre from the point.<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> And firſt, what meanes that bedlam ſpirit, whereby A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts, Quakers, and the reſt of that ſame batch are acted, that have learnt a Religion to juſtifie their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, pretending as the Jewes of <hi>Caeſar</hi> that they know no King but Chriſt, as if he were a loyal ſubject to his Prince that contemn'd his Deputy; <hi>Facile im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium in benos, peſſimus quiſque aſperime rectorem patitur, &amp;c.</hi> The corrupteſt tempers have ever been moſt apt

to ſcorne authority, I wiſh ſuch maſterleſſe monſters would conſider how well that querie might might be propoſed to them wherewith the Lord confounds <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necharib;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 19. 22</note> 
               <hi>Whom waſt thou railed on and whom haſt thou blaſphemed, and againſt whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?</hi> (not againſt <hi>Hezekiah</hi>) but againſt the holy one of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               <hi>Iſrael</hi> was weary of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and God tells them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had caſt off him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it ſhews us that Magiſtrates power is not<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> arbitrary, they are ſome of heavens commiſſioned Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and may ſay as the Centurion, though they have others under them, yet that they themſelves are men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der authority; and oh how careful ought ſuch to be of breaking their Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. it ſerves exceedingly to encourage Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates:<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> Can they think that God will employ them in his work, and not bear them out in their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? ſure you ſerve no ſuch hard Maſter. 'Tis a note of <hi>Paraeus,</hi> did not God (ſayes he) countenance<note place="margin">Pareus in loc.</note> and aſſiſt them that are Miniſters of Juſtice, did not he ſtand in the Aſſembly of Princes, it could never be that the face of authority ſhould be ſo formidable: that God that promiſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that one ſhould chaſe a thouſand, is he that makes the face of a ſingle Magiſtrate to awe the hearts of a thouſand malefactors.</p>
            <p>Take heed next of undertaking Gods work, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> their own. Yea, judge for God ſaid, good <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat,</hi> to his Judges, therefore take heed. Oh how ſhould it be the ſtudy of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate to paſſe ſuch a ſentence as God himſelfe would paſſe did he take the matter into his owne hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:119063:14"/>It acquaints us with that harmony that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween<note place="margin">Uſe 5.</note> Magiſtracy and Miniſtry. The ſame word ſerves for both: Miniſter in a general name that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to either.

33. 16. And ſo did <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 Chron. 14. 4.</p>
            <p>I am forc't to leave the Application to your ſelves, and muſt haſten to the next thing.</p>
            <p>And that's from the other end of Government (<hi>viz.</hi>) the puniſhment of evil-doers, but if thou doeſt evil, feare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Whence we note next, that good Laws are<note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> terrible to none but to evil perſons. In this ſenſe the Law troubles not a righteous man; but its threatnings are levelled againſt the lawleſſe, ſuch as tear the bonds of Government, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did his withes, and cry out we will not be be bound. To ſuch the Law is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for terrour, excellently <hi>Solomon</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 26. A wiſe King ſcattereth the wicked, and cauſeth the wheel to turn over them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what evil is it that falls within the reach of civil juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Any civil or religious: the Magiſtrate is <hi>cuſtos utriuſque tabulae,</hi> all Laws propounded without limitation<note place="margin">Mr. Leigh.</note> muſt be underſtood in their latitude.</p>
            <p>Two things briefly it leſſons us. Firſt, to obſerve a<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> difference between the precious and the vile, and in drawing the ſword of juſtice alwayes to have a blow at wickedneſſe, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> deſerves to be our preſident here, who having ſorted his ſubjects, beſtows his favour on the good, his frownes on the evil, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 6. Mine eyes ſhall be upon the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me. Theſe he intended ſhould be to him, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> men of office and honour, but <hi>v.</hi> 8. betimes I will deſtroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off the workers of iniquity from the City of the Lord: if men in place would ſtudy this choice, and make ſuch a difference among their inferiours, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119063:16"/>
ſaid they might ſave the labour of forcing men from evil by their power. I am prone to beleeve they would winne ſo many by their practice.</p>
            <p>It charges Magiſtrates that they do not do juſtice by<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> halves, take heed you do not puniſh one for ſpeaking one word againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and let another ſcape that ſpeaks too againſt Chriſt, to all evil-doers a Magiſtrate muſt be terrible. <hi>David</hi> threatens impartially to weed out the wicked, to cut off all the workers of iniquity; This is indeed not to beare the ſword in vaine, the laſt thing that craves your attention and notes to us is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That the end why God hath armed authority<note place="margin">Doct.</note> with the ſword is to do execution upon the wicked. An alluſion, ſayes <hi>Calvin,</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls, who had<note place="margin">Calvin <hi>in loc.</hi> Principe non fruſtra gladium teſtat ſed ut ſtringat in malafactoris, <hi>Eſtius in loc.</hi>
               </note> axes and ſwords carried before them as enſignes of their power; 'Tis not in vaine this ſword is committed to them, no 'tis to give notice that they have <hi>poteſtatem vitae &amp; necis, Gladium geſtant ut impios plectant</hi> (ſaith one) 'tis to cut off the wicked, which otherwiſe, like rotten and gangreen'd members, would endanger the body. But here it muſt be remembred that the ſword of juſtice muſt be furbiſht with the oyle of mercy. The Malefactor in the Law muſt lie down and be beaten, and that before the Judge but with a certaine number of ſtripes, and that too according to the nature of the treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 3. the ſame puniſhment is no more fit for all offences then the ſame phyſick is for all diſeaſes; The <hi>Romans</hi> had as well rods as axes borne before their Conſuls to intimate that ſome offences were as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently puniſht by the whip as others by the block.</p>
            <p>And now that I may not loſe the advantage of doing<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> God ſome ſervice in ſo ſacred a ſolemnity as this, I ſhall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119063:16"/>
keep me no longer to generals, but parcel out the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of my diſcourſe, and addreſſe my ſelf briefly to all ſorts in particular, that my doctrine may fall as the dew, and though here a little, and there a little, yet may leave ſome moiſture upon all.</p>
            <p>And firſt, (Right Honourable) your dignity beſpeaks the upmoſt roome, 'tis for you, there's none more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable then your ſelves that is bidden of it. You here authority is no empty word. Magiſtracy implys ſomewhat more then a title of honour, take heed of ſparing when God bids you ſlay, let not the ſword of juſtice ruſt in the ſcabbard, and prove like the ſword of <hi>Jeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Judges had need often to edge the ſword of Juſtice<note place="margin">Judg. 8. 20.</note> with the file of courage, <hi>fiat justitiarunt coelum</hi> was a good reſolution. Be champions of juſtice while you can, and when you can no longer ſerve her as ſuch, keep your ground, and reſolve to die her martyrs.</p>
            <p>As to the caſe of Religion (my Lords) though I hope I may ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> to his <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> of love I need<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>To Commiſſioners of peace that are aſſeſſours with you, I have onely this, do not ſay, as <hi>Saul,</hi> all is well in the Countrey, if ſo, what means the bleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſheep, and the lowing of oxen that we heare? what meanes the roaring in Ale-houſes, prophanation of Sabbaths, with other crying abominations? what's the matter that ſo many with <hi>Malchus</hi> have loſt their right eare that they cannot hear a complaint, nay, ſometimes the right eye, that they cannot ſee a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order? Is it not woful, that many a Magiſtrate, like <hi>George</hi> on horſe-back, ſits alway with the ſword up, but never ſtrikes. The Lord give you <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpirit as well as <hi>Moſes</hi> place, and write upon your hearts reſolution for the Lord.</p>
            <p>As for you, Gentlemen of the Gowne, I intend no Satyr but a Sermon, and therefore 'tis but a word of Councel that I would venture to give you, looking<note place="margin">Whatſoever you would that men ſhould do to you, &amp;c. <hi>Mat. 7. 12</hi>
               </note> neither for bribe nor fee, ſave onely a deſire to ſee the fruit of my lips in the conſecrating of yours. O read often the Law which is both the Law and the Prophets.
