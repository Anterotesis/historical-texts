            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y desire is (Judicious and Learned Reader) that it may not prove offensive unto any, if (in the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Physicall and Theo-philosophicall Patron St. <hi>Luke</hi>) I mention and cite the testimony of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Writ, to prove and maintaine the true and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Philosophy, with the virtuous properties of that eternall Wisdom, which is the Foundation and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-stone, whereon it is grounded. Was not this the radicall Subject of my foresaid Patron, who was as well a Divine Philosopher, as a Physitian? If the office of of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder, was for Souls and Angels, to ascend from the Earth unto Heaven, and to descend from Heaven unto Earth, and that by many steps or degrees, corresponding-to both the Elementary and ethereall or Heavenly nature: Or (as the Poet, speaking mystically), If the chain of Nature hath its highest and last linck, fastned unto the foot of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s chair in Heaven, as the lower is fixed on Earth: how is it possible for us earthly creatures, or rather divine Images, howsed and obscured in clayie tabernacles, to wade, of our selves, through the confused Labyrinth of the creature, unto the bright Essence of the Creator; that is, to search out the mysteries of the true Wisdom in this world, and the creatures thereof; but by penetrating with a mentall speculation and operative perfection into the earthly Circumference or mansion thereof, and so to dive, or attain by little and little unto the heavenly Pallace; I mean, the middle point or Center thereof, where onely her abiding place is to be found, who is the Center of all things; whose Circumference is no where, rationally, to be imagined or thought of? If God therefore in and by his Eternal Word or Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, hath first made the creatures, and sustained the same unto this present; How can a reall Philosopher enucleate the mysteries of the Creator in the creature, or judiciously behold or express the creature in the Creator (for in him are all things); but by such rules or directions as the onely store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of Wisdom, namely the holy Scriptures have registred, and the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of that sacred Spirit indited for our instructions? Shall we with the <hi>Agarens,</hi> and those which were of <hi>Theman,</hi> forsake the Fountain of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to search after true Wisdom, where it is not to be found? And yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, lest mine intention should by the misprision of any, be ill inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted or misunderstood, I think it convenient, to certify you, that my p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>pose, in the progress of this Sacred or Mosaicall Philosophy, is farre from
<pb facs="tcp:57108:3"/>
any presumption, to trench upon, or derogate from the deep and mysticall Laws of Theology in her pure and simple essence, or to oppose the current of her Argument against those usuall Tenents and Authentick rules in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, which have been long since decreed and ordained by the Ancient Fathers of the Church. But as it is certain, that one and the self-same place in Scriptures hath a two-fold meaning, to wit, an internall or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and an externall or literall; and either of these two senses are true and certain, though they seem to vary or differ by a diverse respect: no otherwise than under the name of one and the same man a double nature, namely a spirituall Soul, and a materiall Body, are really to be understood: So also besides such mysticall interpretations, as the Texts of Scripture do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally contain; it may also express and delineate externally such created realities, as belong unto the true Subject of the most essentiall Philosophy. And again, we ought co consider, that the Subject or method in proceeding or handling of both these progressions, are in some sort different, being that the one (I mean Theology) pointeth directly at the sincere and simple nature, with the virtuous extentions and powerfull operations of the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, making her demonstration à <hi>Priori,</hi> as if for the proof of a Circle's existence, one should begin his inquisition from the formal Center or middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, and so proceed unto the Circumference. The other (to wit, Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy) moveth by a clean opposit action or method, from the externall of the creature, or organ, <hi>quasi demonstratione à posteriori,</hi> to dive and search into its internall Center, that it might there find out, or attain unto the knowledg of the eternall Actor; to wit, of that all-working Wisdome, which doth manifestly act or operate in it; being warranted in this her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of research by the wise Physiologist <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     </note> who teacheth us <hi>to search after, and to discover the unknown Work-man, by his known or visible works;</hi> that is, to apprehend the Divine or eternall cause, by the created or temporall effect.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom. 1.20.</hi>
                     </note> Or (as the sacred Philosopher St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath it) <hi>to see and consider the visible things of God, that is, his eternal Power and Godhead, by his works;</hi> No otherwise than the hidden centrall Monady, or punctuall Unity of a Globe is, after diligent inquiry found out by moveing first from the Circumference by the semidiameters, and then, attaining by degrees unto the middle and secret point, which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth as a formall prop or essentiall Corner-stone, to sustain the whole Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Fabrick. Which being so, and seeing that the holy Bible doth fully handle and set down the Subject of both these Sciences, by the way of the two foresaid Demonstrations, namely as well after a Physicall as Metaphysicall manner: My hope is, that this my Philosophicall Discourse, will not be therefore si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterly judged of, by the truly wise and unpartiall Reader; because it chiefly relieth on the axioms or testimonies of Scriptures. Now, That the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Text doth every where specify the manner of these two proceedings, it is made apparent, in that it doth certify the mysticall acts or operations, as well of the aeviall and temporall, as of the eternall world. But it is clear, that the eternall world, which hath neither beginning nor end, being onely replenished with the glorious Majesty of God, is the main Foundation on which Theology is grounded; as on the other side, the temporall or lowest world, having both beginning and end, and being divided into a visible heaven and earth, with the creatures thereof, is the main plat-form of the true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy. As for the aeviall world, which hath a beginning but no end, and was ordained by God, to be a receptacle for the Angelicall Spirits and blessed Souls, as it hath its position betwixt both the extream worlds, namely that
<pb facs="tcp:57108:3"/>
of Eternity, and the other of Temporality; for it hath an immediate rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or commerce with them both: For first, it receiveth its immediate light, life, or formall existence, from Eternity; and then it poureth it out, or communicateth it with the temporall or inferiour mansion, to create and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vify it with the creatures thereof: insomuch, that as the formall act of the temporall world is Angelicall; so the vivifying soul or spirit of the aeviall, is divine or eternall. Wherefore it followeth, that the nature and property of Angells, is neither to be excluded from the Subject of Theology; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they participate with the Divine Light or bright presence of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; neither can they be exempted from the body of Philosophy, being that the Angelicall light is the soul and life of the Temporal nature, and consequently the true Philosopher must acknowledg his essentiall science or Philosophicall grounds, to proceed radically from the Eternall God by his aeviall or Angelicall Spirits, into his temporall creatures, <hi>I</hi> mean the Stars, Winds, Elements, Meteors, and perfect mixed bodies; and therefore in respect that the Philosophicall Subject is animated by Angelicall influences, it must needs pierce with a mentall regard into the eternall Light, which doth centrally vivifie both the aeviall and temporall creatures; beyond the which there is nothing to be found or imagined.</p>
                  <p>This therefore is the perfect tri-partite measure of that Ladder which <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> dreamed of,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen. 28.12.</hi>

Thus may the sacred Philosopher, with the Prophet,<note place="margin">

And therefore I may lawfully conclude, with these axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms of the divine Theo-Philosophists, which appertain as well unto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal act in the Creature, which is the true life of Philosophy, as the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall virtue of Divinity,<note place="margin">

                     <argument>
                        <p>Here the Author expresseth his Reason, why in the very entrance into this Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall Discourse he propoundeth the making, properties, and usage of this Weather-glasse, and wherefore he styleth it by name of his Experimentall Instrument.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Must confesse that it is a thing worthy of commendations to prove and maintaine a Philosophicall Proposition, by such acute and peircing shafts of Auguments, as are selected out of the quiver of naturall reason: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those kind of subtill inquisitions or objections (though they seem at the first sight probable, and may carrie with them a shew of Truth, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse in the conclusion, may fall out amisse and be found erroneous;) Therefore such as are zealously devoted unto the inviolable Truth of the holy Bible, will bee better established in their beleefe, if that the testimony thereof doe concurre and agree with the rest. And although these two witnesses may appeare unto wisemen to take away all Scruple or doubt from the confirmation of the Truth, yet is the incredulitie of this world so exalted and grown up to such a height of obstinacie, and that especially among the common sort of men; yea verily, it hath so subtilly crept also into the spirits of some of no small lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which are guided more by the practise of sense then any spirituall reason, that except, with St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> they see or feel, or, with the <hi>Jewes,</hi> they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a signe, they will in no case be brought to believe. For this reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, since I onely am to enter the lists against the Ethnick Philosophers, who by their inventions have framed out the wisdom of this world, it behoveth me to look to my self, and to gird my loines with a belt of courage, and to indorse an Herculean Armour of proof, being that, as the Apostle did fight with beasts at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in the likenesse of men, so am I sure to have to do, like another <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides,</hi> with a second Lernaean Monster, of many heads, I mean, the Protean Philosophy of men, the doctrine whereof, as the Apostle teacheth us, <hi>is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon vain fallacy, on the traditions of Ethnicks, and according unto the elements of this world, and not according to Christ, in whom is the plenitude of Divinity. Col.</hi> 2.8. I purpose therefore with my self, to make and forge me out an Armour, of solid naturall reason, and to temper it with the warrant of sacred authority. And lastly, I will make choice of ocular demonstration, to serve me in this combat, insteed of an unresistable weapon, or Herculean club, to tame and subdue that unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable monster, <hi>Incredulity</hi>; than which, there is no greater enemy unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And that I may the better accomplish and bring to passe this designe of mine, it is requisite, I should have in a readinesse each necessary materiall, for this conflict; and above all, I ought to have an especiall care, to provide me an experimentall Instrument, or spirituall weapon, which may carve out a ready way to the truth, by a manifest and infallible demonstration, objected even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eyes of such, as are infected with extream infidelity, that they may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by turn from their vain and sophisticating Philosophy, with the wisdom of the world, on which it is erected; and become unfained and faithfull schollars and proficients, in the true and sacred Philosophy, or wisdom of God. I will make therefore election of such demonstrative Machins for my purpose as is vulgarly knowne amongst us, whereby my intentions may be more easily understood of every man; and this Instrument is commonly styled by some, the Calendar-Glasse, and by others, the Weather-glasse: whose composition or fabrick, with the properties and uses thereof, I purpose to expresse unto you briefly, in the Chapters following.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>How the Instrument commonly termed the Weather-glasse, is falsely arrogated by some Men of our age unto themselves, as being averred to be an invention of their owne.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>MAn is so greedy of glory, and so desirous of fame and reputation, that if he can acquire or purchase it any way unto himselfe, be it directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57108:5"/>
he careth not much: I was the reason that the Ethnick Philosophers did sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitiously assume and ascribe unto themselves those principles of their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, which of right did appertain unto the wise and divine Philosopher <hi>Moses,</hi> and did mask or gild over their theft, with new names or titles, which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on them, the better to make a shew, that they were established by their own inventions, and shall be shewed hereafter. In like manner, the Instrument, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly termed the <hi>Calender,</hi> or <hi>Weather-Glasse,</hi> hath many counterfeit Masters or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, in this our age, who, because that they have a little altered the shape of the modell, do vainly glory and give out, that it is a Master-piece of their own finding out. As for myself, I must acknowledge, and willingly ascribe unto each man his due, and therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e will not blush or be ashamed, to attribute justly my Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall principles unto my Master <hi>Moses,</hi> who also received them, figured or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out by the finger of God; neither can I rightly arrogate, or assume unto my self, the primary fabrick of this Instrument, although I have made use of it in my Naturall History of the great World, and else-where (but in another form), to demonstrate the verity of my Philosophicall Argument; for I confesse, that I found it Graphically specified, and Geometrically delineated, in a Manuscript of five hundred years antiquity at the least. I will therefore set down unto you first, the shape, in which I found it in that antient Monument, and afterwards made use of it for demonstration's cause: And secondly, I will describe the figure and position of, as it is commonly known and used among us.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>Where you see, that there is no difference betwixt them, but onely in their forms or shapes; for the Sun-beams operating by their heat, upon the hollow ball of the head <hi>A.</hi> maketh the rarified aire, included in the said ball, to passe out by the pipe <hi>AB.</hi> into the pot of water, and so it vanisheth out through the superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the water, in the form of bubbles; but when the Sun goeth down, the cold night approaching through the absence of the Sun, doth coagulate, contract, and condense again that included aire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was the day before rarified, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and hot action of the Sun. But because there is not aire enough in the leaden ball and pipe, to effect this kind of condensation in a due proportion, by reason of a part thereof which was exhaled the day before; therefore to hinder all vacuity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57108:6"/>
in the operation, there is sucked up out of the pot of water <hi>C.</hi> into the leaden pipe, just as much water as there wanted aire, or as did correspond unto the aire exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Again, when the Sun riseth the next day, the aire in the ball and pipe will be rarified, and then by dilating it self, will repell the water to his former place, the which was mounted into the pipe. And so this alteration in condensation and rarefaction, will ever hold in the same manner, more or lesse, according as the Sun is nearer or farther off from us; or according unto the coldnesse or heat of the Wind, that bloweth in the element.</p>
                     <p>The self same also will happen to the aire, included in the second glasse; for the globe or ball in the top of the glasse, which is the bowl of the Matras or bolts head, is full of air, and is exactly, in every respect, referred unto the ball of lead, as the streight Pipe which ascendeth out of the water, and is joyned to the head, is exactly compared unto the crooked pipe of the first; so that if the leaden ball be erected upwards, and the crooked pipe be made streight, to ascend perpendicularly out of the pot of water, unto the leaden sphear, then will there be no difference betwixt the shape or figure, of the first &amp; second Machin or Instrument; so that each man may discern, that the condition and usage of them both, are all one in effect.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Here the fabrick of this Organ or Instrument, properly termed the <hi>Weather-glasse,</hi> with the preparation of the Matras or Glasse, commonly called a <hi>Bolts-head,</hi> and the adaption of the Orifiace or Nose thereof, into a small vessell of water, is expressed. Where also, their opinions are confuted, which deem and affirm, that the water is sucked up into the neck of the Matras by heat.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FIrst, we must observe, that this our experimentall Instrument is composed of three parts, where of two of them are more essentiall, and proper unto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Engin or Machin; namely, the Matras, or Bolts-head, and the small vessell of water, into the which the nose or orifice of the Matras, after it is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ought to enter: and the other is more accidentall, as being onely ordained to sustain the glasse firmly, in his perpendicular position, and to adorn and set forth the Machin. Touching the Matras or Bolts-head, it is a round or ovall glasse, with a long and narrow neck, whose orifice, or mouth and nose, ought to bee propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o the rest of the neck, and it must be prepared after a two-fold manner; for first of all, the long neck of it being put perpendicularly into the small vessell, being full of water, so that it do touch the bottom of the vessell, we ought to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure from the superficies, or top of the water, and begin our division into degrees, still ascending upwards, till we come unto the very ball, be it round or ovall. And whereas the common sort of this kind of Weather-glasses, hath his first degree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning downward, marked with the figne of 1. and so ascendeth upward to the round ball, according unto the naturall Arithmeticall progression, thus: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15. I for a better method's cause, do alter the order in numeration, and dividing of the neck or pipe of the Matras in the middle, between the head of it, and the superficies of the water. I mark the place of the division with the figure 1. and so count my degrees downward and upward unto 7. after this manner: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. which I affect, for reasons that I will expresse unto you hereafter. So that the matter will be ordered thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57108:6"/>
                        <figure/>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the small vessell of water, you see it here also described, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the pipe of the Matras, that descendeth into the bottome of it; which is so farre from division as it entreth into the water.</p>
                     <p>Now when you have thus divided the neck of your Matras into parts, you must prepare, and order it after this manner to make it magneticall and attractive by cold, and expulsive or dilatative by heat; you must therefore take the orifice of the Bolts head in your hand, and hold forth the head thereof, or the round which is above it against the fire, till it be very hot; for the heat of the fire will rarifie and dilate the Ayre in the glasse, and cause by that meanes a good portion of it to flye out of the glasse's orifice, and so it will remaine in that estate, so long as the glasse is in the degree of heat: at which time, if you suddenly put the nose of the pipe into the water, you shall perceive that as the bolts head doth keel or waxe cold, so also will the water by little and little mount upwards into the neck of the glasse: And we must, note the hotter the glasse is made, and the colder the externall ayre will be found as that present, the higher and by so many more degrees will the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ascend into the neck. And the reason hereof is, because that as heat doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the aire, so the greater the heat is, the more excellent will the degree of rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction be. Contrariwise, as cold doth condense and thicken, so the greater the cold is, the stronger will the condensation be: and therefore, after that the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded aire is much rarified, by an intense externall heat, It followeth, that as the heat doth by little and little fade, so the cold will by little and little prevail, and have dominion; and consequently, the included rarified aire must needs by little &amp; little be condensed; but because there wanteth sufficient matter or corpulency in the aire, for the cold to work on, being that a part of it was spent and evaporated by rarifaction, It followeth, that as the succeeding cold doth condense &amp; contract the aire, so the aire by contraction of it self, must also attract and suck up into it, so much water out of the vessell, as there wanteth air to satisfie the contractive appetite of the cold; for the interposition of the water between the externall aire,
<pb facs="tcp:57108:7"/>
and the internall or included aire, will not permit the internall, to suck or draw into it the externall to supply her want, for the satisfaction of the externall cold's lust, and therefore the water is forced to asscend, in lieu of the externall aire. And this is the mystery of the Instrument, and the manner of his fabricle, whereby it plainly appeareth, that they have been deceived which have deemed, that the heat was the occasion of the attraction of the water upwards, being that each man may be an eye-witnesse, that it is heat that driveth it downwards; and contrariwise, that cold is the cause of his mounting.</p>
                     <p>And whereas some Sophisticators, to make the matter the more strange, have given out, that it is a secret peculiar included spirit, which worketh the feat; and to make men to give credit to their tales, they have dyed the common water in the vessell with Vardegrease, or such like stuffe; I must give you to understand, that all their prattle is but deceit, and that plain dealing is a jewell.</p>
                     <p>As for the accidentall part of this Machin, being it is framed and composed in a diverse fashion, I will not graphically delineate, or draw it out unto your view, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the pictures will be chargeable; and the matter being done, will serve you but to little purpose.</p>

                        <p>I Divide as well the property as the use of this Instrument, into two kinds, whereof I call the one generall, and I make the other more peculiar. As for the generall property of it, by the one it contracteth and condenseth, namely, when the included aire is animated by the externall cold; and by the other, it dilateth and rarifieth, to wit, if the included spirit be excited by any externall heat. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, through his constrictive nature or action, which is made evident by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the aire; we may easily discern the universall reason, of the inspissati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and condensation of things that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>re thin. And again, by his dilatation, we may scan or decipher the cause of rarifaction of such things, as were thick. For by the speculation we shall find, that there is nothing in the whole Empire of Nature, which can be rarified and made subtle, except it be by the action of light or fire, whether it be visible or invisible; and the essentiall effect of that action is light. And on the contrary part, nothing can be condensed or inspissared, where dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hath not dominion; forasmuch as darknesse is the essentiall root of cold, which is the immoderate act or in condensation. The particular properties, with the uses thereof, are manifold; for first, The nature of it, is to discover the temper of the externall aire, or catholick element, in heat and cold; for the higher that the water doth climbe in the neck or pipe of the Matras, it argueth, that the firmer &amp; stronger is the dominion of cold in the aire; so that by this means we may daily judge, of the increase or decrease of cold in the aire; and by consequence, we may guesse at the proportion of heat, in the sublunary spirit of the world, by the descent of the water.</p>

                        <p>If the water in the space of one night doth descend, it is also a signe that raine will come not long after.</p>
                        <p>If the South or East wind do blow, immediately after a North or Westerlie wind, the water will fall by certaine degrees: but if the North wind or cold Westerlie wind do blow, after a Southerne or Easterlie wind, then will the water be forth with exalted.</p>
                        <p>If the water doth attaine unto the figure. 1. it argueth that the Ayre is in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration between heat and cold, as when the Sunne is in the vernall Equinoctiall, or as the naturall temper of the Spring useth to be.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57108:7"/>But if the water mount higher, then it argueth that the disposition of the Ayre is by so many degrees more of Northen or Boreall nature, as the water is mounted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the bolts head; for you must conceive that the degrees from 1. unto the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost 7. are belonging unto the winter <hi>Hemisphere,</hi> and therefore are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees which note the augmentation of cold. So that if the water do mount up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. 2. in the Northern or higher part, it is an argument that cold hath dominion over heat in the externall Ayre only by one degree. If it mount unto the 3. of the same Hemisphere, it doth foretell a slight frost: but if it ascend unto. 4. or. 5. it pretendeth a hard and solid frost: if it come unto 6. and 7. it argueth great ice; but if it mount yet higher, it sheweth that a hard Ice is likely to surprize and cover the whole river of Thames.</p>
                        <p>On the other side, if the water descend from. 1. unto. 2. of the lower ranck of degrees which importeth the Summer or hot Hemisphere, then it argueth heat hath gotten dominion over cold by one degree. But if it descend unto 3. or 4. it importeth a greater distemper of the Ayre in heat: if it descendeth unto 5. or 6. it demonstrateth the ayre to be exceeding hot, but if the water be beaten downe unto the lower figure of 7. it sheweth that extreame and Sultry heat, causing Corusca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and lightnings, hath dominion in the Aire.</p>
                        <p>So that we may discerne how great a reference or relation there is between the externall ayre or universall sublunary Element, and the Ayre included in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument. But I will in better termes expresse the Consanguinity and Sympatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call relation which is between the one and the other in this subsequent Chapter.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>Here it is proved evidently, notwithstanding any objection which may be made to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that not only this experimentall Organ hath a relation unto the great world, but also the spirit included in this little modell doth resemble and imitate the action of that which is included in the great or macrocosmicall Machin.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt before I will proceed in any further comparison, between the spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the small modell, with the properties of the agents and patients in it, and this of the great world; I do think it to be necessary, first, to answer unto a certain doubt or objection that may be made, the which, unlesse it be resolved and taken away, such a relation or comparison may appear unto the ignorant, either improper, or altogether impossible. I know therefore, that not a few will object and say, that no convenient comparison can be made, between this our small arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall Machin, and that naturall fabrick or organ of the world; forasmuch as the spirit in our Glasse is every where inclosed, and strictly included in his vessell, and therefore may easily be incited by force, to move according unto the regular fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, or fashion of the glasse: But the case is far otherwise in the spirit, which is contained in the vast cavity of the world; for in it, the aire or spirit doth use at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impulsion, to move freely this way and that way, as we are instructed by daily experience, in the blowing of the winds from each quarter of the world. Unto this I answer, That it is the self same reason of motion and relation, from a thicker or denser nature, unto a thinner; and in like manner, from a thinner or rarer, unto a thicker or denser, in a small subject, that is in a greater; so that the like respects be had, and that by an equall weight, and proportionate measure, in cold and heat. Yea verily, and I averre boldly, that the whole World, or worldly Round, is as well and compleatly stuffed or filled with spirit or aire, as is this our artificiall vessell, or experimentall Machin; which if it should not be, it would consequently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that vacuity would be admitted into the nature of things, the which would be but an absurd thing in a Philosopher to credit. Wherefore we may boldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the spirit is in the like quantity, weight, and proportion, in the conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of this instrument, considering his magnitude, as it is in the great or little world. But experience teacheth us, that the self same nature, be it hot or cold, which useth to reigne and have dominion every quarter of the year, in the cosmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or worldly spirit, doth produce the self same effects in rarifaction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densation of the aire, included in our artificiall vessell, as it useth to procreate in the aire of the world; all which is fully demonstrated before. For by how much the more the state of the aire doth abound in heat or cold, by so much will the water
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57108:8"/>
contained in the neck of the glasse be depressed, by reason of the included aire's subtilation. And again, by how much the more the inclemency of cold doth vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and abound in the air, by so many degrees higher will the water be exalted. And this is the reason (as it is already told you) that by the observation of this Weather-glasse, the temper of the aire in the great world is so exactly discovered unto us. And therefore by this it is evident, that the foresaid doubt or scruple is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished and taken away.</p>
                     <p>I would in this regard have each discreet Reader to understand, that, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth this Instrument's nature, he contemplateth the action (as it were) of a little world; and that it hath, after the manner of the great world, his Northern and his Southern Hemisphear, plainly to be discerned in it, the which two are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided exactly by an Aequinoctiall line in effect, which cutteth the Degree, signed with the character 1. Also it hath his two Tropicks, with their Poles; onely we take the Southern Pole and Hemisphear to be hot, in regard of us, because the breath which commeth from it is from the Sun, which in our respect is Southern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposed; and therefore we term that Pole, the Summer-Pole or Hemisphear, and the other, the winter-Pole or Hemisphear. And we have demonstrated, that the degree in the neck of the Glasse 1. doth correspond exactly unto the place of the Aequator, because that if the Northern or Winter Tropick be imagined to be the Basis of one Triangle, whose Cone shall end in the centre of the Northern Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick, then it must follow, that where the intersection is made by these two imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Triangles, the Aequator must of necessity passe. As for example.</p>

                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57108:8"/>And we tearm the place of the Aequinoctiall, the Sphear of equality, because when as the Sun is in <hi>Aries</hi> or <hi>Libra,</hi> which are the vernall and autumnall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section of the Aequinoctiall, the daies and nights are equall; so also, the temper of each Hemisphear in heat and cold, is naturally observed to tend unto a medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity or equality. Even such also will the temper of the <hi>micro-cosmicall</hi> aire, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick spirituall element, be unto the earth, when the water in the Glasse is drawn up half way.</p>
                     <p>I have sufficiently described unto you as well the fabrick as the nature of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, and therefore since I have prepared it to serve me for ocular demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion instead of an Herculean Club, in this combate which I undergoe against our insulting Peripatetick Adversary; and that I am provided of sufficient naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons instead of a trusty armour; and that this armour is well tempered and made as it were musket-proof, at the least by Authority drawn out of the whole Harmony of the sacred Bible, Why should I fear the number of mine enemies when it is T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If God be with me I care not who is against me, being that verity, which conquereth all things, will (I am well assured) fight for me, and defend me, though but onely one against a multitude. Why should I expect any favour from them, in telling the truth, and condemning their errours, since that they do Satyrically censure, and deride my honest endeavours, when I hold my peace, and say nothing unto them? It is an easier matter for malitious carpers and back-biters, like temerarious and rash Cynicks, to find fault with a thing; than with moderate and judicious spirits, to judge, amend, and correct it with equity. In the first, namely, to condemn before the case is heard or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, it is an argument of envy, cloked with wilfull ignorance. In the latter, namely, to teach a man his errours, a token of learned zeal, and Christian charity.</p>

But as from all beginnings, there was a distinction, or opposite difference, between light and darknesse, good and evill, righteousnesse and unrighteousnesse; and, to conclude, between the reall things of God, and the prestigious and imaginary inventions of man: So also is there a main contrariety to be observed, between the true wisdom which is of God, and that false and onely-seeming one, which is of this world; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, there must be an endlesse jar and antipathy, betwixt the essentiall and true-bred Philosophy, and that which is bastard and spurious.

My preaching</hi> (saith he) <hi>is not in the perswasions and words of human wisdom, but in the shewing forth of the Spirit and verity. We speak and utter forth wisdom among the perfect, not the wisdom of this world, but the wisdom of God in a mystery, which is hidden and secret, the which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto the Elect by his Spirit.</hi> In these words we are taught, first, that the smooth perswasions of the wise-appearing Oratours, or lip-learned Sophisters, and self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited Philosophers of this world, are vain; being they bring along with them nothing else, but an empty wind, without any materiall or substantiall fruit, and are in effect but a meer shadow, in regard of a reall matter or subject, forasmuch as they prestigiously appear something, but are indeed nothing; when contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the words of the true and perfect Philosopher, are essentiall, and therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with vertue and power.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that what the true and powerfull Philosopher utters, is the flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fruitfull wisdom, even the eternall sapience of the Almighty, and not the sterill wisdom of this world, which when it is brought unto the touchstone, will be found counterfeit, as being unable to endure the tryall.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that this heavenly wisdom is onely mystically revealed unto mankind, as being reserved in the power of God, and solely discovered or opened unto the Saints, and elect, and therefore unknown unto the Pagans; or Ethnick wise-men who are the composers of our Christian Philosophers wisdome, and therefore it is a vaine fallacy or sophisticate philosophy; forasmuch as <hi>it is framed</hi> (as the Apostle saith),<note place="margin">Colos. 2.8.</note> 
                        <hi>through the traditions of men; according unto the Elements of this world, and not after Christ, who is the true wisdome, for in him dwelleth all the plenitude of divinity, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</hi> And for this reason, the same Apostle saith in another place, <hi>Nos non spiritum hujus mundi accepimus sed spiritum qui ex Deo est, et quae à Deo donata sunt nobis loqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, non in doctis humanae Sapientiae verbis,</hi>

But it telleth us of subalternat efficient natures, namely, of Intelligences, of Stars, of Elements, and such like things, which operate or effect, of themselves, all things above and beneath, and will have the world to be eternall, and without all beginning; when contrariwise this true Philosophy telleth us, that God <hi>created all things in and by his word</hi> and wisdom; that <hi>he operateth all in all,</hi> and, <hi>that he is all, and in all.</hi> For the plain words of the precedent Text is, <hi>Omnia in ipso constant, All consist in him.</hi> But to the purpose.

Jehovah did possesse wisdom in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his waies, before any of his works, and before there was any time, before the world was made; she was brought forth before there was any abysse, and before there was any fountains that did abound with water, before the mountains had their foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when as yet he had made no earth.

But after that this eternall Spirit of wisdom, had bestowed on each creature a peculiar vertue in its creation, then the creature can act of it self by a free-will, which is absolutely; and distinguished, and divided from the immediate act of God. I answer, that by our founded rules in Divinity, the true essence of the Deitie is individuall, and therefore God doth impart no essentiall act or vertue unto any creature which can be discontinued or seperated from Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And for this reason, Christ who is the eternall spirit of wisdome is said to fill all, I marry (will our learned say) that is vertually, but not substantially or essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. I would fain know (laying all such school distinctions apart,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.4.</note> of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to beware) if the vertue of God be not his essence, or whether the one can be divided from the other? If they reply and say, that this vertue of God is no essence but an accident: Verily they must needs erre in saying so, being that it is most certainly known unto the very Jewes and Gentiles themselves that God hath not any accidents in him, seeing that he is absolutely essentiall, and reall of himself, for where his divine act is, there is also his vertue, and, where his vertue is, there is he truly said to be essentiall: for else the word or divine act which doth vivifie and quicken every creature, should seem to be but an Accident, and that divided from the divine essence: which, how absurd it is, the immortality and root of it doth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue: For <hi>David</hi> in his forsaid text sayeth, <hi>spiritu ab ore ejus omnis virtus eorum, from the spirit of his mouth doth issue every vertue of the heavens.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 32.6.</note> I imagine that there is no man of an upright sense that will esteem this vertue to be an Accident; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, then must it needs be essentiall, and consequently in God, and of God, and therefore not divisible from his spirit: But what needs more words when Scriptures do confirme this every where?<note place="margin">Colos. 1.16.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> sayeth, in the text before mentioned, <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam in ipso cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for this cause, the Apostle condemneth Philosophy in generall tearms, not but that the love of the true wisdom is good, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the lover of it is no lesse to be honoured and esteemed; but he meaneth, the love of the worldly and human wisdom is vain: and he tearmeth it so, because that the Ethnick Philosophers added <gap reason="foreign">

For this cause therefore (I say) it was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be embraced of Christians, and hereupon the Apostle admonisheth us, to beware <hi>of philosophy, and vain fallacy,</hi> &amp;c.

God is revealed from heaven, upon all the impiety and unjustnesse of those men, which do detain the verity of God in unrighteousnesse, because that what is known of God, is made manifest unto them, for God hath revealed it unto them. For the invisible things of him, and also his everlasting vertue and divinity, being understood by such creatures as were made from the worlds creation, are beheld or made manifest. So that they are inexcusable, because that when they knew God, they did not glorifie him, or give him thanks, but did fade away, or vanish in their own imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkned. And therefore in saying that they were wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into the similitude of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed beasts, and of serpents,</hi> &amp;c.

Besides all this, the true Wisdom is peaceable, not ambiguous, nor apt to be cavilled with, or contentiously to be disputed of, neither needeth it an infinity of distinctions and quiddities, framed out of mans braine, which rather leadeth the disciple by the multiplicity thereof into ignorance, then it doth elucidate the brightness of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked truth: But the false Philosophy, is so full of distinctions, subtil and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticall evasions, so subject to cavills and disputations, and so contentiously composed, and, in fine, so difficill, and in effect so fruitless, that, instead of the true and essentiall graine, we find but chaff; instead of truth, we gather but words; instead of essentiall reality, we collect scarce a type or shadow of Verity; in lieu of sincerity we find but vanity; and, in conclusion, is more in appearance overmasked over, for the most part, with a seeming probability, then indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be discerned;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4.</note> and for this cause, the Apostle saith, <hi>Praedicatio mea non est in persuasivis humanae sapientiae verbis, sed in ostensione spiritus &amp; virtutis: My preaching is not in the perswasive words of humane wisdome, but by the manifestation of the Spirit and of power.</hi> For this reason therefore we find, in the one of the two kinds of wisdome, the fruits of power, vertue, and miracles, such as the true and divine Philosophers did produce by the Omnipotent Corner-stone, (I mean the true Wisdome) in times past, and made them manifest unto the world: Whereas the other can do nothing indeed, but produce cavillings, dispute, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and fallacies, the fruits whereof, in the conclusion, is naught else but vanity: It is not I, but the Spirit of truth, that assureth you thus much.

                     <p>Now his doctrine was concerning the true Philosophy, whose foundation was <hi>Jesus Christ, or the true wisdom and corner-stone, which sustaineth all, and is all in all, and filleth all, and acteth or operateth all in all</hi>; which is contrary unto the tenour of the Ethnick doctrine, seeing that it maketh an infinity of essentiall Agents in this world, as Daemons, Stars, Elements, Meteors, Fire, Water, Cold, Heat, Man, Beast, Plant, Minerall, and such like; the which they will have as subalternate es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall Agents, to act and operate of themselves, not understanding, that there is but one catholick and indivisible Agent in many mansions, which doth operate by, and in, an infinity of organicall vehicles, all in all, and over all. And this doctrine of theirs hath so infected our Christian Philosophers, which are of their sect, that they distinguish of Gods Beeing, saying, That he is present <hi>vertualiter,</hi> and not <hi>substantialiter,</hi> or <hi>essentialiter.</hi> As who should say, that Gods vertue can be without his essence, or divided from his divinity, which is indivisible; and so they dream of some accidents to be in God, which are distinguished from his essence. Or else they distinguish and say, that he operateth all <hi>principaliter</hi> and <hi>mediate,</hi> as he is the first cause. But, say they, there are an infinity of secundary causes, which act and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of themselves. But I wonder, if that were true, how God can be said to fill all things, and operate all in all; if he be onely the first efficient cause, and not the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall cause of all action in this world, by his blessed Spirit, which he sent out into the world, to do the will of him that sent it, as well in heaven as in earth. What needs more words, when the Apostle in plain tearms decideth this controversie in the Text before mentioned? <hi>Etsi sunt</hi> (saith he) <hi>qui dicuntur Dij sive in coelo, sive in terra,</hi>

why should not the foundation thereof be the true wisdome, which came from God?</p>
                     <p>But before I come to the answering of this objection, I beseech thee (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) give me liberty, first to apologize a little for my self; Be thou therefore pleas'd in the first place to understand from my just and upright spirit, that I acknowledge and confess this Prince of the Peripatetick Philosophy to be a personage of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found speculation; and that he had as deep an insight into the light of nature as any of the common ranck of Philosophers in his time: Yea verily, he had so sharp an ingeny, and so subtill and refined a spirit, that he not only allured by his worldly craft and humane invention, the Gentilish Greeks (whereupon he was termed by them, Cacodaemon, or a deceitfull spirit, or seducing from the truth,) but also Christians themselves of every sect, even unto this present: Insomuch that they are so wedded unto his worldly wisdome, that they admire each new proficient in Philosophy, of their Universities to maintaine his actions, and not to decline from his doctrine. As for my self, though I may be rancked in that number, yet now I have collected my spirits, and have by Gods grace attained unto that light of holy Scriptures, whereby I am made able to distinguish and discerne their essentiall col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, from this praestigious one of Pagans; I must say with Cicero, that <hi>Quaedam promissa sunt servanda nimirùm licita,</hi> and on the other side, <hi>Quaedam promissa non sunt servanda, nempe quae sunt illicita; Lawfull promises are to be observed, but such as are unconscionable are to be violated</hi>: Now God forbid, good Christians should imagine that any oath which is made to derogate from the verity of the holy Bible, should be perpetually confirmed; for that were to rebell against the truth. Wherefore my essentiall Motto, in this my old age (notwithstanding any alleageance which I have by a ceremoniall rite vowed unto <hi>Aristotle</hi> in my youth) shalbe, <hi>Amicus Plato, amicus Aristoteles, sed magis amica veritas; though Plato, and Aristotle, be my friends; yet truth is more my friend, and therefore ought most to prevaile with me.</hi>

But if they reply that perchance <hi>Aristotle</hi> had an insight into the Christian doctrine, or did apprehend Christ in some manner, or at least had an eye into the wisdome of Moses

and the Prophets. First, I answer, That as <hi>Aristotle</hi> was before the incarnated Word, so also is it evident, that he knew little of the Mosaick learning, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth upon the Creation, effected by the spagerick act of the divine Word, when he would have the world to be eternall. I confesse, that his Master <hi>Plato</hi> was more essentially grounded on the true wisdom; but <hi>Aristotle</hi> being puffed up with self-conceit, would, in derogation from the Stoicall doctrine of his Master, arrogate all wisdom unto himself, by framing out or fashioning a new worldly wisdom or phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, which was afterward tearmed <hi>Peripateticall</hi>; and so by his vain glory, he added unto some truths many of his own inventions, making as it were a Gallimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry of good and bad, of true and false, of wisdom and folly together, which is far from the nature of the perfect Christian wisdom, which must needs be therefore wholly truth it self, because it is described by the Spirit of God, in the which there is nothing but truth. Again, if the Peripatetick, Stoick, or Epicureall doctrine, had been perfect, and according unto the true wisdom Jesus Christ, why should the Athenian Philosophers so persecute the right and exact Philosopher <hi>Paul,</hi> for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the true wisdom Jesus Christ, in whom onely is the plenitude of divinity, as the same Apostle teacheth in divers places? By this therefore we may perceive most plainly, what the wisdom is, on which <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath built his Philosophy. But I will come a little neerer unto the point, or main mark, and compare the double wisdom expressed by St. <hi>James,</hi> an other true Christian Philosopher, or Apostle of Christ,<note place="margin">James 3.15.</note> who telleth us in the place above mentioned, that the <hi>wisdom which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And again,<note place="margin">Acts 17.</note> seeing that <hi>in him we live, move, and have our being,</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> saith) we should by consequence, (and that without all question, dispute, or brabling-quarrels,) know, and understand in our selves, that <hi>summum bonum,</hi> which truly-wise men seek after, and, with <hi>Tantalus</hi> his appetite, do so fervently affect.

Thus we see how contrary the Greekish wisdome is, unto that of the Apostle's; for as much as the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57108:20"/>
Greekish Philosophy is contentious, litigious, full of disputes, brables, and emulations; for which reason it is pronounced by St. <hi>James,</hi> to be <hi>terrene, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, diabolicall,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">James 5.</note> 
                        <hi>and not from above</hi>; whereas contrarywise, that Philosophy which is grounded on the true wisdome, which is from above, <hi>must be first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging, envy or hypocrisy.</hi> For this cause therefore, our Christian Philosopher <hi>Paul,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisheth his Schollar <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>eschew all profane,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.20.</note>

Again, saith the Apostle <hi>James, The wisdome which contradicteth the Truth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">James 3.</note> 
                        <hi>is not from above, but terrene, animal, diabolicall.</hi> Now I am assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that all good Christians will maintain, that the fountain of Truth, and Verity, is the holy Bible. What will our Christian followers of <hi>Aristotle</hi> say, if I will prove evidently, that <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s doctrine doth erre from the maine grounds of holy Writ, which is the treasure of Verity, and consequently from that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is the Father of Light? It is a common phrase among our lip-learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sophisters, to say, when any contradiction is found between some axioms of Greekish Philosophy, and the sacred Assertion, Oh, this is true in Philosophy, but in Scripture it is found otherwise: I say, to these, that if there be found any contradiction between the points of the one, and that of the other, there is a foul error, and falshood, or contradiction in the one or other, and therefore the one of the two, must needs issue from a terrene, and diabolicall, or mundan and human wisdome. Now judge, each good Christian, whether we should rather stick unto Gods Word, which is the only Truth, or the affirmation of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which deriveth his wisdome, from the father of lyes, I mean the mundan wisdom, which is for that reason termed of the Apostle diabolicall or devilish. Others say, that men are so deeply conversant in the secrets of nature, or naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolosophy, that they are become Athiests, and will acknowledg no God: They must needs understand of the Ethnick Philosophy, and not point at that of Jesus Christ; for that leadeth and directeth the understanding spirit of man, even unto the Throne and Majesty of the true God: and perswades him to forsake the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of this naughty world, to betake and contract it self unto that blessed uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from whence his bright Spirit was originally derived. A third sort of men seem to repine and storm, that any man should presume to mingle naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy with Divinity, or should dare or attempt to draw any axioms or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities out of Scriptures, to prove or maintain the Principles or causes of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy: averring boldly but erroniously, that the Bible doth onely teach unto man, what belongeth unto Salvation, that is to say, how we should feare God, and behave our selves unto our neighbours: As who should say, that the holy Scriptures had indited any thing in vain.<note place="margin">Colos. 2. John 14.26.</note> And yet it is plainly found in them, <hi>that all the treasure of wisdome and science doth lie hid in Christ.</hi> And it is said in another place, <hi>A me discetis omnia: Ye shall learn all things of me.</hi> And again, <hi>Spiritus Sanctus vos docebit omnia:</hi>

No verily, but rather we may
<pb facs="tcp:57108:21"/>
excuse these zealous accusers without true understanding, and say, that they meant of intermingling the false Aristotelian wisdom, with that of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which is onely truth; for, would these persons but rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that <hi>Philosophia,</hi> in his originall sense, importeth <hi>sophiam,</hi> or <hi>wisdom,</hi> they would acknowledge and confesse, that the true and essentiall philosophy, or <hi>sophia,</hi> is nothing else, but the sacred wisdom, or holy spirit of discipline, which is the ground of not onely that, which animal men of this world tearm Naturall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy: but also of the whole subject of Theology. So that if we consider the case rightly, we shall plainly perceive, that sacred Philosophy is nothing else, but the ground-work of Divinity, or an expression of God and his acts in his creatures; or, if you will have it so, in things as well supernaturall, as naturall. Neither can any man finde, that God was ever mentioned or specified in Scriptures, but as he was considered in this world which he framed, and the creatures thereof: So is he said,<note place="margin">Psal. 103.2.

And yet it so falleth out, that many an Academist in this world, is so extracted beyond the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the creature in their researches, that they, forsooth, seek him out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Moon, nay, beyond the margins of the vaulted world, and so divide him absolutely from his creatures; in which proceedings, they do but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or presume to clamber up a ladder, without steps or degrees.

                     <p>I may therefore boldly conclude and say, that if Christian Schollars would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow that seven years, which they employ in their Aristotelian study, in the true, essentiall, and sacred Philosophy, they would not so erre after the manner of the Gentiles, but embrace without any rebellion or contradiction, the precepts of the true wisdom, so firmly, that they would at the end of the said time, be compleat in that essentiall doctrine, and made fit members to proceed in the streight way of enquiry into, and acquiry of, the mysticall wisdom, which God hath ordained to be revealed unto his Elect: and so after the example of the Apostles, they might as well become potent in vertue and power, as they appear now onely puissant in words, being hindred from the good fruit which accompanieth true wisdom, by the erroneous doctrine of their seducing Master. I know, that this good perswasion of mine, will make the followers of worldly wisdom to storm, and to say of me, as the Stoicall and Epicureall Philosophers did to <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> What will this babler have, or what doth he tell us of a new way of learning? I answer, That it is not I, but the word which they follow, that teacheth them, if they will be pleased to mark it well, and sequester themselves, in the mean time, from the rules or documents of their Ethnick Master..</p>
                     <p>But I will come unto my nearer proofs, whereby I will most evidently shew, that the doctrine of <hi>Aristotle</hi> is a manifest enemy, and opposite or contradictory unto the truth; which being so, it is by the Apostle <hi>James</hi> condemned, for a branch of that wisdom or philosophy,<note place="margin">James. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>which is terrene, animal, and diabolicall.</hi>

                     <p>It appeareth, and shall be hereafter proved out of the Book of verity, that the vertue whereby God doth manifestly operate in this world, is expressed either by attraction, from the circumference unto the center; or expulsion, from the center unto the circumference; namely, Contraction, or Dilatation. For after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is produced Condensation and Ratification, whereby the heavens, and the earth, and elements, with compound creatures, as well Meteorologicall, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly mixed, as such as are compleat in their composition, were created and made. And again, by it he operateth in this world, either sympathetically, that is, by a concupiscible attraction, or antipathetically, that is, by an odible expulsion. Since therefore that all things are effected in this world, by attraction or expulsion, let us see what is <hi>Aristotle's</hi> opinion touching the cause of attraction, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward examine, whether it accordeth with the tenour of truth.</p>
                     <p>The Petipatericks being perswaded thereunto by their Master <hi>Aristotle,</hi> do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in this, namely, That the Winds, the Thunder, the Comets, the Clouds, and other such like Meteors, are made and caused by the attractive heat of the Sun, and other Stars, which draw up vapours and exhalation out of the water and earth, and elevateth them into the regions of the aire. And therefore, <hi>Prout</hi> (saith <hi>Velcury,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the mind of <hi>Aristotle</hi>) <hi>magis minusve calidi sunt vapores, ita altius, aut humilius elevantur sursum à solis calore aliorumque astrorum:</hi>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57108:22"/>
and attract water unto it.</hi> Hence therefore hath that palpable errour been introduced into this world, namely, that fire and heat do suck and draw unto it vapours and fumes, when it may be made most palpable and evident unto the simplest, so that he have but human sense about him, that the heat of the Sun and fire doth rather discusse and expell from it, by dilatation, than allure unto it by the way of attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: As for example, if the fire did draw vapours unto it, then would it not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any smoak to go from it, but the contrary is seen, <hi>viz.</hi> that it discusseth by dissolution, and expelleth and seperateth by rarefaction the subtill from the grosse, not with a desire to draw or attract the vapours, made by rarefaction unto it; but to expell and disjoynt it from the whole grosse body it worketh upon, for which cause we see the fumes and smoaks to fly away, and to be inforced to avoid the action of the fire, without any inclination of the fire to retaine them; also if we apply a wet handkercher unto the fire, we shall see that the watry substance in it will be subtiliated by the heat into a reaking vapour: but as for the fire it is so farre from attracting of it, that the reaking smoak will be seen to rise up in the house at randome without any evident attraction of the fire. In like case it happeneth with the Sun's operative faculty, for it subtiliates or ratifieth the water or humid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances by his heat, and consequently it draweth nothing at all unto it: but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusseth rather that which was thick, into thinner portions. Now the reason that water or grosse humid substances, being rarified, do ascend upward, is not any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive faculty in the Sun or Starrs, but a naturall inclination in the thing it selfe: for it is a common axiome that <hi>omne leve et sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which being thus, as ocular experience, the mother of fools, hath taught us, let our Christian Peripateticks but duely observe, the subtle wisdom of their Master, whom they have hitherto followed, and let them see and consider how grosly he hath erred, in the main argument, pillar, or prop of his Meteorology; which being so, what can be more expected, then that the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the same should fall before the eyes of each wise contemplator.

                     <p>IN this present Book, the Author teacheth in a generality, the true and essentiall principles of the divine Philosophy: and in particular he expresseth, how various and differing the Ethnick Philosophers have been in their opinions, concerning the beginnings of all things; where he proveth, that the wisest amongst those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Naturalists, did steal and derive their main grounds or principles, from the true and sacred Philosopher <hi>Moses,</hi> whose Philosophy was originally delineated by the finger of God, forasmuch as the fiery characters thereof, were stamped out or engraven in the dark Hyle, by the eternall Wisdom, or divine Word. And sheweth, that although the foresaid pagan philosophers, did usurp the Mosaicall principles un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o themselves, and, the better to maske their theft, did assigne unto them new Titles; yet because they were not able to dive into the centrall understanding of them, nor conceive or apprehend rightly, the mystery of the everlasting Word, they erected upon their principles or foundations but a vain and worldly wisdom, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out, not from the essentiall Rock of truth, nor relying on Christ, the onely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-stone, but framed after a human invention, and shaped out according unto the elements of this world; much like a Castle of straw or stubble, which though it be planted on a Rock, yet it is subject to mutation, and is easily shaken, and tottered at every blast of winde. In conclusion, here our Author doth set down, what the true Mosaicall principles are, namely, Darknesse, Water, and Light: Then, that all plenitude and vacuity in the world, doth consist in the presence or absence of the formall principle, which is Light. And lastly, he sheweth how the two apparent active properties, namely, Cold and Heat, do issue from the two fore-said foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Darknesse and Light, as the two passive natures, Moysture and Drought, do challenge their originall from the said active.</p>

                        <p>Wherein is set down the uncertainty of the antient Grecian and Arabian Philosophers, in their opinions, touching the principles or beginnings of all things.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an evident Argument that the Ethnick philosophers were not well setled upon the grounds of their philosophy but did waver in their imaginations touching the true principles of nature, being that among each sect of them there was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and upheld a variety, yea and sometimes a plaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety, of opinions concerning them: as for example, <hi>Thales Milesius,</hi> who was inrowled amongst the number of the wise men of Greece, had his opinion that Water was the beginning of all things. But <hi>Anaximenes</hi> and his disciples affirmed, that an infinite aire was the first cause or originall of every existence. And for this reason also, <hi>Anaximander</hi> did esteem this catholick aire to be God. Again, on the other side, <hi>Zoroaster</hi> will have all things to take their beginning from Fire and light; as also the <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> say, that there is one universall Fire in and over all things in this world. And verily, each of these opinions, if they be duely considered, will be found to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and have a near relation unto the Mosaicall truth; for a divine fire or light issuing forth of darknesse, or the dark abysse, did suddainly by its bright presence reveal and make manifest, the hidden and invisible waters, the subtiler part whereof is the vast spirit of the aire; and for this reason, both <hi>Thales</hi> and <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> do seem in some sort to agree in one subject: And yet, if we penetrate more profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the businesse, we shall perceive, that these two did insist but upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall or passive principle, forasmuch as from it, the substance of heaven and earth, and every thing therein, hath his existence or materiall beeing. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, <hi>Zoroaster</hi> did not without reason make choice of fire, for the primary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all things, in that it did proceed and appear in act, before the waters or humid nature were made manifest, no otherwise then action goeth before passion, or the cause precedeth the effect. And yet neverthelesse, he erred in this his asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because the active principle can in no wise rightly be considered, but as it hath his relation unto a passive originall. The Stoick <hi>Zeno,</hi> therefore, being more wary than the rest, establisheth his opinion concerning the first Principle, by a firmer tye or obligation, saying, That the substance of the fire being by the aire converted into water, is the beginning of all things. But <hi>Empedoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>es</hi> would be sure to lay his grounds more surely (as he vainly imagined) than <hi>Zeno</hi>; and for that cause did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain the four Elements, to be the radicall principles of all things, whereof two of them are agents, and two patients.</p>
                     <p>Now the main errour of these philosophers in their judgments concerning the principles, was, that they did not mark or consider, that the divine puissance or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred word, was more ancient, and of a greater Antiquity, then were any of their foresaid principles; the which, if by a riper contemplation they had understood they would have confessed, being instructed and directed by reasons produced from the eternall unity, or essentiall point and beginning of all things, that the divine light, or sacred emanation (which Scriptures entitle by the name of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of wisdom) was the actuall beginning of all things, as neverthelesse before it, there was another property in one and the same sacred essence, which was termed the divine puissance, or <hi>potentia divina,</hi> which did precede his act or emanation, no otherwise than the Father in time, order, and being, is justly said to exist be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son,<note place="margin">Ecclesiasticus 1.4.</note> or the Creator before the creature: And thereupon the wise man hath it, <hi>Omnium prior creata est sapientia, Wisdom was created before all things.</hi> And yet it is most apparent, that some of the Greekish and Aegyptian Philosophers, namely, <hi>Plato, Pythagoras, Socrates, Hermes,</hi> &amp;c. did so instruct their understandings, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the observation of their predecessors doctrine, and partly through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which in their long travails and peregrinations they had gathered, among the Aethiopians, Aegyptians, Hebrews, Armenians, Arabians, Babylonians, and Indians, (for, over all or most of these Countries did <hi>Plato, Pythagoras, Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and others of them travell, for the augmentation and increase of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as Historiographers, that are worthy of credit, have related) that without doubt they did discern, though afar oft, and as it were in a cloud, the true light in 
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57108:25"/>the humid nature. And among the rest it is reported, as also it appeareth by his works, that <hi>Plato</hi> had the knowledge of the Word, and had read the Books of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>; and for that reason he was called, <hi>Divinus Plato, the divine Plato.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the excellent Philosopher <hi>Hermes,</hi> otherwise termed <hi>Mercurius Trismegistus,</hi> expresseth plainly, that he was not onely acquainted with <hi>Moses</hi> his books, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was made partaker of his mysticall and secret practise, as by his Sermons, which he calleth <hi>Pymander,</hi> a man may plainly discern, where he doth mention the three Persons in Trinity, and sheweth the manner of the worlds creation, with the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, by the Word. And therefore of all other antient Philosophers, I may justly ascribe divinity unto these two: But in this I cannot much commend them, <hi>viz.</hi> in that they having had a view of <hi>Moses</hi> his labours, which were indited by the Spirit of God, did gather out, and confesse the truth of his doctrine, touching the principles of all things, and yet would not in open tearms acknowledge their Master, but altered the names of them; but as <hi>Plato</hi> served his Master <hi>Moses,</hi> even so was he dealt with by his schollar <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who knowing that his Masters three Mosaicall Principles of all things, masked under strange titles, were but truth, would neverthelesse arrogate his doctrine unto himself, and for that cause did alter the assumed names of <hi>Plato</hi>'s principles, gilding them over with new denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and did afterward rear up upon them, a spurious philosophicall structure, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and framed out after his own inventions, which may be therefore rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto a house of straw or stubble, which though it be erected upon a firm rock or foundation, yet because their stuff is Heterogeniall unto the truth, and evilly compacted, it will not endure a storm, no, not the least blast of truth, but will easily be destroyed and cast down. Thus may every good Christian discern, how each of the Ethnick Philosophers have stolen their principles from <hi>Moses</hi> his grounds, stolen I say, because they expresse them under covert names, without any acknowledgment of their Master, which did arrogate his doctrine and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Spirit of God which did teach him it, and did practically express the grounds thereof, in the apparition which God made upon the Mount <hi>Sina</hi>: For upon the grounds of these three Principles, the true mysticall Philosophers or Theosophers did pronounce, that as well the externall Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall of Jesus Christ was erected; which was not discovered or discerned by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> how cunning soever he maketh himself, which if it had been so, he would not (without all doubt) have founded or built, upon the true Corner-stone, I mean the eternall Wisdome, a bastard Philosophy which did differ in shape and essence from the true Foundation. And although he was taught in some sort by his diviner Master, yet was he, as it doth, appeare, all together ignorant of the centrall truth thereof: wherefore it was but a folly in him, who is so vainly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified for the Prince of Philosophers, to make a privation where there was no precedent position, or information, being there was a <hi>Chaos</hi> before any thing else was created. But it was no marvel, being that he surmised, the world, and all things or Species thereof, to be eternall that is to say, without beginning and end; which if it had been true indeed, he then had said but rightly, that the dark Abysse or Chaos, in respect of its beeing without form, was a Privation of some Act or form in an actuall pre-existent matter. But that this is false, the whole concurrent of the Scriptures do confirm,<note place="margin">Wisd. 11.18.</note> being that it is said, <hi>that God created the world of matter without form, and that the heavens and the earth were first of waters, and by waters,</hi>

                        <hi>and consisting by the word of God.</hi> And that the Originall or primary womb, from whence the waters were extracted (which were the materiall stuff, whereof all things were framed) <hi>was this dark and deformed Abysse or Chaos,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 1</note> and therefore had the beginning of their formall being, from the Father of all-informing and vivifying light and essence. But that we may directly shew unto you the egregious theft of the foresaid Philosophers from <hi>Moses</hi> his Principles; That Principle which <hi>Moses</hi> termed <hi>darknesse, the darke Abysse</hi> or potentiall Principle, <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth call his <hi>Materia prima, or first matter,</hi> which he averreth to be something in puissance or potentially only, because it is not as yet reduced into act. Again, he seemeth to term it privation, but falsly, being that no position did precede it. On the other side <hi>Plato</hi> calleth it <hi>Hyle,</hi> which is esteemed to be nothing, forasmuch as it is invisible and without form. Also he compareth it to a dark body, in respect of the soul and spirit. As for <hi>Hermes,</hi> he intitleth it by the name of <hi>umbra horrenda, or fearfull shadow. Pythagoras</hi> maketh it his Symbolicall Unity: From in this its estate, it hath relation unto nothing else but it self, which is mere Unity, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57108:25"/>
it acquireth not so much as the name of a Father, because it doth not by an emanation respect or attempt the production of a Son. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> will have it named a deformed Chaos, or an universally troubled mass, without form or shape. Again, as touching the first inacted passive Principle, or the primary pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive matter, out of which all things were carved. That which <hi>Moses</hi> called wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth intitle by the name of Second matter; forasmuch as it was begotten and derived out of the bowels of the first-matter, or Chaos, or dark abysse: which also <hi>Plato</hi> termeth the Spirit, and <hi>Hermes</hi> the humid nature. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> with <hi>Anaximenes</hi> the vast and universall aire of this world. <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> pointeth at it Symbolically, by the number of duality, which is the mark of imperfection; for it argueth thereby, the imperfect estate of matter being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the formall character of Unity, which maketh three, and therefore the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary number is esteemed amongst the wisest Philosophers, for the root of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect numbers. To conclude; that vivifying and animating Principle, which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> called light, proceeding from the Spirit of the Lord, <hi>Aristotle</hi> maketh his formall beginning; <hi>Plato,</hi> the act or soul of the world; <hi>Pythagoras</hi> delineates it by the number of three, and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calleth it that immortall heat, the which when all things were troubled in the beginning by contention, did sore up unto that upper region, which the Ancients do call the Aether or Heaven. Is not this therefore a notable kind of Robbery amongst the choisest Ethnick Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, thus fasly to ascribe and attribute the Principles and Doctrine unto themselves, which were revealed by God's Spirit, unto the wise Prophet <hi>Moses,</hi> and that of pupose to make themselves great and eminent, not only in the eies of the Gentiles, but also by subtill allurements, or false and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding suggestions, laid on those foundations, to distract Christian men from the Truth? And yet as for <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Hermes,</hi> I must excuse them, being that they do both of them acknowledg in express terms with <hi>Moses,</hi> that the matter or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance wherof the heavens and the earth were made, was a humid nature, and the internall form or act, which did dispose of it into diversity of figures or forms, was the divine Word, as you may find most plainly expressed in <hi>Plato</hi>'s works, and in the <hi>Pimander</hi> of <hi>Hermes</hi> or <hi>Mercurius Trismegistus.</hi>

And this is the originall occasion of the multiplicity of Idolatry, which hath and doth hitherto raigne in this world, namely, of the worshipping of the Sun, Moon and starres, of sacrifices offered unto Idols or false Gods, and deceiving Devils, of the Veneration of <hi>Isis</hi> and <hi>Osiris,</hi> of the adoration of <hi>Saturne, Jupiter, Mars, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> of the immolations or offerings unto <hi>Caelum, Vesta, Ceres, Proserpina, Vulcan, Pluto,</hi> and <hi>Neptune,</hi> with many other errours and absurdities, whereby ignorant men are rather seduced from the knowledg of the true God, than any way induced unto the understanding of him rightly. And this very same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine relying on the invention of man, hath been the occasion that the world hath erred concerning the divine Word, and through blindness have not perceived the operations and properties of the holy Spirit, in the creatures; yea verily, it hath been the occasion, why some of our Christian Philosophers themselves, have neglected the research of Gods Actions in his creatures, as well visible as invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: they are (I say) so wedded unto the Aristotelian Philosophy, that they do voluntarily avert their eies from the true and certain Science of the Meteorologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Science, revealed by the Scriptures, which are the fountains of Wisdome; to follow the uncertain, and scarce-probable doctrine of their Ethnick-Master, touching that admirable subject.

                        <p>What were the Mosaicall Principles or beginnings in generall: How they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and extracted out of Nothing. Then what is meant by that word Nothing. And lastly, the first Principle, which is the dark Abysse or Chaos without form, is particulaerly described.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Mosaicall Principles are very plain and evident, unto all such as do wisely contemplate, and observe the words of the most excellent Philosopher <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> in his first Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi>: For before there is made any mention of that Spagiricall separation, which by the Word of God, or divine Spirit <hi>Elohim</hi> was effected in the six daies work of the Creation, mentioned and expressed there, It is said that darknesse was upon the face of the Abysse;<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> and that <hi>Terra erat inanis &amp; vacua: the Earth was without shape and form.</hi> Where it appeares, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth, were not as yet inacted or informed, but were one deformed, rude, and indigested masse, and consequently all were complicitly comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in one dark Abysse, but explicitly they were as yet nothing: as for example, we see that a great tree, with his body, branches, bark, leaves, and fruit, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly comprehended, in a grain or kernell; but explicitly it is no such thing, but only somewhat <hi>in imaginatione.</hi> St. <hi>Augustin</hi> compareth this <hi>Nothing</hi> unto Speech, which whilst it is in the mind of the speaker, is as nothing unto him that it is spoken unto, that is to say, somewhat in puissance, and nothing in essence; but when it is uttered or spoken, then is that which was before complicitly, <hi>in animo loquentis,</hi> now explicitly apprehended by the hearer. <hi>Plato</hi> compareth it in this estate of its Nullity, unto a vision in a dreame, which when a man awaketh. proveth nothing saving a mere imagination: But because this speech, to wit (God created all things of nothing) hath pusled the minds of many understanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, being it could not be perceived really, what should be intended, by this word <hi>Nihil,</hi> I purpose in few words to discourse upon it, and to expresse mine opinion, what is meant thereby.</p>
                     <p>Saith the Prince of Peripateticks, <hi>Ex Nihilo nihil fit</hi>: A learned Sentence, and infallible axiom, of so learned a Personage, if the sense of the word were alwaies to be construed one and the same way: But I say, being founded on good grounds, that if there be any, who either upon presumption, or through ignorance, are of an opinion, that in these words (God created all things <hi>Ex nihilo, Of nothing,</hi>) this word <hi>Nihilum</hi> or nothing, ought not to be taken or interpreted for <hi>Nihilum negativum,</hi> or such a negative nothing, which falleth not under the capacity or understanding of mans reason or intellect: Such a kind of <hi>Nihilum</hi> or Nothing was never meant or taken for the first-matter of the Creation: For it appeareth as well by the infallible sense of holy Scriptures, as the sacred Light in nature: that the first essence and matter of all things was from all eternity in God, and with God, one and the same thing; and this we prove out of Scriptures, after this manner.<note place="margin">Gen. 1.1.</note> Saith <hi>Moses: In Principio creavit Deus coelum &amp; terram: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</hi> In which speech, this word <hi>Principium</hi> is not to be taken for a negative nothing: For the Scripture telleth us, in plain terms,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.36.</note> that <hi>ex ipso, &amp; per ipsum, &amp; in ipso sunt omnia: Of him, by him, and in him are all things.</hi> And therefore if all things proceed from God the Creatour, who is the highest of Entities, it followeth, that it proceedeth not from a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive nothing.

invisa,</hi> as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> interpreteth it, but <hi>Tremellius</hi> hath it, <hi>Ex materia informi, Almighty Lord, thine hand hath created the earth or world, of an invisible or informed matter.</hi> And therefore, if of an invisible matter or substance, without shape; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that it is not of a negative or absolute Nothing. Also the Scriptures say in another place, <hi>Fide intelligimus aptata esse secula verbo Dei, ut ex invisibilibus visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia fierent;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 11.3.</note> 
                        <hi>We understand by faith, that the world was so made or adapted by the word of God, that of invisible things, such things as are visible were made</hi>; and consequently not of an absolute or negative Nothing. Moreover, if God had not produced and created all things essentially out of himself, but of a vain negative nothing, then creation would not appertain unto God, neither could it rightly be referred unto him, that is to say, if all things were not essentially of him, nor did take their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from him; then verily it must needs follow, that all were not made by him, but would have their existence from Nothing; neither would they consist in him, but in Nothing. But it is evident, that the case is otherwise; for the Creation is the work of God, and not the work and subject of Nothing; he is the entity of all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, the life of all the living, the beginning of all beginnings, and the fountain of all waters, of which heaven and earth were framed. To conclude, nothing ever came into being, or had its existence from any other, but onely from him, and by him, neither can any thing exist but onely in him. And therefore we may conclude, that God did beget, produce, make, and create nothing, but that which was eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in himself; which also the Apostle seemeth to verifie in these words, <hi>In Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto sunt omnia condita sive visibilia sive invisibilia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Colos. 1.15.</note> 
                        <hi>ipse ante omnes &amp; omnia in ipso constant, angeli, throni, potestates, dominationes, per eum &amp; in eo sunt creata qui est principium. In Christ are all things made and created. He is before all, and all, as well visible as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, consist in him. The angels, thrones, potestates, dominations, were by him and in him created, who is the beginning.</hi> But because this is more fully discussed in the first Book of my sympatheticall and antipatheticall History, I will say no more of it in this place, but proceed directly unto my purpose. As therefore darknesse is rightly termed <hi>potentia divina,</hi> so also is light called <hi>actus divinus,</hi> which the Cabalists ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press by <hi>Alephtenebrosum,</hi> and <hi>lucidum,</hi> as else-where it is declared. And therefore the Scriptures aver in another place,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.28. Colos. 3.11.</note> that God is <hi>omnia in omnibus, God is all in all.</hi> And again, <hi>Christus est omnia in omnibus, Christ is all in all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I say therefore, that the very same which is meant by <hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>dark abysse,</hi> and <hi>terra inanis, Job</hi> tearmeth <hi>umbra lethalis,</hi> because it is void of form and life; and for that cause he saith also, <hi>Aquilonem extendit Deus supra inane &amp; vacuum. &amp; suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit terram supra nihilum:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job. 26.7.</note> 
                        <hi>God spread or extended the north upon the void or inanity, and did hang the earth upon nothing.</hi> Whereby also it appeareth, that it was not the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative <hi>Nihil,</hi> but a matter that was <hi>in potentia ad actum, in the way to be inactuated,</hi> being destitute neverthelesse as yet, both of any form or act. But, <hi>Forma dat nomen &amp; esse, Form doth give unto each thing its name and being.</hi> And therefore it conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently followeth, that because this first matter was without form, it was justly tearmed Nothing, as having neither name or essentiall being, seeing it was onely something in puissance,<note place="margin">Pimander. 3.</note> and nothing in act. Therefore <hi>Hermes</hi> tearmeth it, <hi>potentia divina,</hi> the divine puissance. And again he saith, that in the instance of the appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of light, it seemed unto him to be a fearfull shaddow, saying, <hi>Umbra horrenda obliqua revolutione subterlabebatur;</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>ALL things were complicitely contained or comprehended in the divine pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issances, (as is already shewed) which, in the regard of human capacity, was without form, forasmuch as it was contained within one deformed or invisible water, which was therefore called, the Mother of the Elements, and Seed of all things; for as the whole plant or tree is contained in a small kernell, or little mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen seed, and is no way subject unto mans apprehension, before it sprouteth forth, even so all things were in the beginning in the water potentially, as also the water was an invisible thing, without form or shape, vailed over with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; for darknesse was upon the face of the abysse, which was termed the first matter, that had no formall act that man could imagine, and therefore was said to be onely in puissance. A wise Philosopher therefore, and deeply seen in the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call works of the Creation, speaketh in this manner: The first matter out of which the water did issue, was <hi>nihil,</hi> or nothing, and out of it was created the matter of the waters; and this ought not to be understood after an human manner, namely, that God did create the waters of Nothing; and yet it was spoken rightly, because that in the beginning, nothing was visible. But if wise men would elevate their thoughts above the vulgar capacities, to find out by speculation the originall of the waters, then would they not deny, but that before the creation of the waters, there was a certain matter in the highest mystery, that is to say, in the divine puissance, or dark and informed abyss, which was the catholick treasury or store-house, as we may say, out of which the waters did flow in the creation: and this is partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Scripture in divers places, for the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us in the place before mentioned,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.3.</note> saying, <hi>Fide intelligimus aptata esse secula verbo Dei, ut ex invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilibus visibilia fierent; We understand by faith, that the world was made or ordained by the word, so that things which are visible were made of things which were invisible.</hi> Whereby it is evident, that the things which fall under mans sense and kenning, were not at the first subject unto mans sense, and therefore were esteemed as if they were not.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 28.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> also in like manner saith, <hi>Deus eligit ea quae non sunt, ut ea

Whereby it is plainly argued that waters were the materiall principle being created or inacted by the spirit of the Lord, or <hi>Elohim Ruach</hi>: Forasmuch as they were nominated before the first dayes work. Secondly, that it was the said eternall wisdome, or spirit <hi>Elohim,</hi> who acting as it were the part of a mid-wife, did deliver, and bring forth this birth; and gave it act and form. Again we may learn out of the same Chapter of <hi>Moses,</hi> that the waters were the Subject of that separation, which was effected by the Spagirick or fiery-vertue of the said Spirit, or divine word. Thirdly that the heavens above were made of the purer brighter and more worthy waters; and the Elementary world beneath, of the grosser darker and viler sort of waters,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> and that there was a midle kind of them, which participating of both extreames was termed the firmament, whose main office was to devide and seperate the water from the waters. Then out of the lower wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by the same word or spirit, were the Elements proportioned and placed, their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57108:28"/>
severall regions, namely the Aire, the Seas, and the dry Land. So that we see how the spirit of the Lord did fabrick the whole world, and every member thereof, out of this humid spirit or aquatick nature, which also is most plainly verified by this Text of the <hi>Apostle Peter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.5.</note> 
                        <hi>Coeli</hi> (saith he) <hi>erant prius et terra, de aqua, et per aquam existens verbo Dei, The heavens were First and the earth, of waters, and by waters existing in and by the word of God.</hi> But the world is composed only of heaven and earth, and therefore it followeth that the whole world is made and existeth of the waters, and by the waters, consisting by the word of God; Now therefore since the Starrs of heaven are esteemed nothing else but the thicker portion of their Orbes, and again every Creature which is below, is said to be compacted of the Elements, it must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so follow that both the Starrs in the higher heaven and the compound-Creatures, beneath in the Elementary world; be they meteorologicall, or of a more perfect mixtion, namely Animal vegetable or minerall, must in respect of their materiall part or existence proceed from waters, the which, as they were brought unto light by the divine word; So also do they eternally consist, and are in their being sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in and by the same Spirit, as shall be plainly manifested unto you in this Chapter following.</p>

For this cause, this eternall infinitude, this all in all, and without all, is rightly described, first by the Apostle, and then by the divine Philosopher <hi>Hermes,</hi>

For as he seemed in the eyes of mans weak and fragil capacity to be <hi>Ain</hi> or <hi>Nihil,</hi> before he would create any thing, yet was he both unity and infinity unto himself, and therefore was complicite all in all in himself, namely, as he to our blinded fancy appeareth, <hi>Aleph tenebrosum,</hi> or <hi>dark and deformed Aleph.</hi> Also, though he shined forth of darkness, and by the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57108:28"/>
of his hidden wisdom or essence, made all things, as well visible as invisible, to exist formally, and so made dark <hi>Aleph</hi> to be changed into light <hi>Aleph</hi>; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, he remaineth all one in himself, and passeth not beyond the limits of his uniformity: for, (as it is already said) <hi>His darknesse unto him is as his light</hi>: Even no otherwise, than we see in the mind or divine mentall beam of man, that it is all one without alteration, when it willeth, and when it nilleth, namely, when it granteth or giveth, and when it denyeth. In like manner, whether the divine infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth shine forth from its center towards its circumference, or centrally contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth his acting beams within it self, yet it is all one and the same in its self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration of the essentiall identity.

In which Speech the Prophet confirmeth, that it is the Spirit of the Lord, who by his presence reviveth; that it createth and generateth, and by his absence or vacancy morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth or corrupteth it. And lastly, by his returning, or restoring of it again, caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both revivification and resurrection from the dead. The which three mysticall operations of one Spirit in this world, the whole Scriptures do handle at full, and therefore we will conclude the last Chapter of this Book, namely, that which succedeth, with this very Subject: which shall truly correspond unto that defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive treatise, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> maketh of generation and corruption. But before we come to speak of it, we must proceed a little further, in the opening of this present Principle. By this therefore that is already said, we may easily perceive, that the Catholick Act, or formall Principle, with his infinity of dilatations, or emanations, are in the hands and volunty of the Creator; who for that cause is said to operate by his Wisdome all in all, as is already declared. And therefore the Schoole distinction, <hi>de operatione mediata, &amp; immediata; principali seu primaria, &amp; minus principali seu secundaria,</hi> with many other such like evasions, forged out by the Ethnick Philosophers (being necessary instruments of the Prince of this world, forasmuch as they by their worldly discipline, do distract even Christians themselves, from Truth and Unity, by a multiplicity of confused distinctions) ought to be quite abolished, being that the only act and Catholick agent in all things is immediatly from God, and is all one in essence with God, and is essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in all things:<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.10. Wisd. 12.1. Wisd. 1.7.

Being that it is the immediate vertue and vivifying emanation from God, and consequently there can be no difference between the immediate act of God and the act of this Spirit, which must needs be immediate in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because, as it is present in it, so also it is most mobil and all-sufficient in it selfe to operate. Now therefore seeing it is evident, that this Spirit is God, and that the essence divine is indivisible, it must needs follow, that where it acteth immediatly, there God also must act and operate immediatly, and therefore all distinctions framed out after the inventions of men being laid aside, these words of the Apostle and <hi>Solomon,</hi> God worketh all in all, doth generally hold over all, and every particular, and consequently we ought to acknowledg no subalternate acting or efficient cause in this world, but onely one identity or divine essence, and that is he who worketh all in all, and vivifieth, informeth, and animateth, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, all things alone, without any assistance, as Scripture tells us in divers places, <hi>Ego IEHOVAH</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>faciens omnia solus,</hi>

Therefore it followeth, that there is nothing in this world which is Inane, in vain, or void and empty. This is maintained by this assertion of the Wiseman mentioned before:<note place="margin">Wisd. 11.18.</note> 
                        <hi>Manus Omnipotentis</hi> (saith he) <hi>mundum ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formi materia creavit: The hand of the Almighty created the world of a matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form</hi>: that is of an inane and void matter, and consequently of <hi>Nothing</hi> or <hi>Nihil</hi>: Forasmuch as it had no denomination, being it is form that giveth the name and essence. By this therefore it may appear, how vain the <hi>Vacuum</hi> or <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity</hi> of the Peripatetick is, in regard of that which by the true Wiseman, is held <hi>Inane</hi> and <hi>Vacuum:</hi> For they esteem their <hi>Vacuum</hi> to be a mere imaginary place in the aire, not filled by any bodily existence, no not by aire it self. But although it be apt to receive some watery existence, namely aire, water, or earth in it. And so they dream of an imaginary <hi>Chimera,</hi> which in verity is of it self absolute Nothing, being that it is impossible that any place should be formed in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, which can be after that manner void, and consequently not worth the dreaming after. But our <hi>Vacuum</hi> and <hi>Inane,</hi> is a potentiall matter, or earth, or Abysse without form, namely that which is only <hi>in potentia ad actum; In puissance to be reduced into Act,</hi> by the presence of Divine Light. It is no marvail though <hi>Aristotle</hi> did not think of this kind of Inanity, and Plenitude, being that in one place he saith, <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit: Of nothing nothing is made,</hi> and in another place he affirmeth Light to be an Accident, and therefore it appeared not unto his sense, that such an accident could take away Inanity or Vacuity, and fill all things essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially by his presence: But I will combate our Christian Peripateticks at their own weapons, who hold it for a Maxim, that <hi>accidentis esse sit inesse.</hi> I will therefore assail them with this Syllogism. <hi>If Light be an Accident, then the existence of it is to adhere,</hi> or to be in some Subject; but the existence of true Light is to exist without any adhesion unto matter or Subject, therefore it is no accident. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor is proved by <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s own Axiom: which is, <hi>Accidentis esse est inesse, aut ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerere subjecto alicui: The existence of an Accident is to be in, or to adhere unto, some materiall Subject,</hi> or else it cannot be. The Minor is maintained by the words of <hi>Moses</hi>: Light was created the first day before any creature, and therefore it had not any precedent actuall matter or Subject, to be in or adhere unto: Besides it is beyond imagination that God should create Accidents before any Essentiall or Substantiall creature. Again, God who is the Fountain of Light, is said to be <hi>Light in whom is no darkness.</hi>

For the property of the dark Nothing, or deformed abysse, is naturally to rest, and not to act or operate; and the reason is, because that all its appetite is to be conversant in, and about the center, beyond the which there is no motion or action, and not to dilate it self towards the circumference, as the Spirit of light, or God in his volunty, or patent nature, is accustomed to do. For this reason, the dark principle doth challenge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it self, by a naturall instinct, rest and quietness; and this property begetteth or produceth one essentiall vertue of its own condition, namely, Cold, the which, as it is elected for a champion to resist the assaults of her opposite, namely, of Heat, whose companions are motion or action, (for the restless antagonist and provoker of Cold is Heat); So unless it be roused or stirred up by the assaults of Heat, it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not, but seemeth to wait upon its drousie mother, Darkness and privation, whose children are fixation and rest, which sleep in, and cleave fast unto, the center, and therefore are unwilling to look forth towards the circumferen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God sendeth forth the snow as wooll, and scattereth the frost like ashes, casteth out the ice like as gobbits; who is able to withstand his cold? He sending forth his word liquefieth all these northern effects. So soon as he bloweth or breatheth forth his wind, the waters do flow again</hi>; that is, the snow, frost, and ice do melt, and are turned into water. Out of which words we may observe many notable things, namely, first, that God in his hidden or latent property, doth by his essentiall action of cold, contract unto the center those things, which were before dilated towards the circumference. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the property of cold is attributed or ascribed unto God, in his nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern action, and therefore it is said, <hi>Who is able to resist his cold?</hi> For which reason it is evident, that it is an essentiall vertue in the divine puissance. Thirdly, That it must be the act of unity in his dark, hidden, and privative property, both because it darkeneth things that are diaphan, transparent, and light; and then because it depriveth of life and motion, that which did act, move, and live, through essentiall heat. And lastly, because it is an utter enemy unto the action of heat, which at ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on the revealed, emanating, and vivifying divinity. Fourthly, that the effects of cold are undone by the act of the revealed nature of God, which is the word; for the Text saith, <hi>He sendeth out his word, and resolveth or melteth all these, namely, the snow frost, and ice.</hi> Fifthly, that all this is effected by one and the same spirit in essence, but of divers and opposite conditions, to perform the will of the Father which sendeth it forth. Again, that the cold property of the winde, is the essentiall depriving vertue, or stupifying and contracting act of God, it appeareth by this of <hi>Job.</hi>

                           <note place="margin">Sap. 7.24.</note> 
                           <hi>piercing through all things, by reason of his purity.</hi> So that as the other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative or Northern property, did produce rest and vacancy from operation, by attraction or contraction from the circumference unto the center; so in this his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive or Southern and Orient property, by dilating himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or sending out his active beam, brightness or emanation, from the center towards the circumference, he doth beget and procreate motion, being accompanied by the essentiall Act of Heat or calidity, which operateth continually upon the effects of cold, in resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dissolving, and destroying of them. So that this formall Champion of Light, namely Heat, warreth perpetually against the cold gardian of Darknesse: For the one can have no dominion in the Aire, untill the other by little and little be exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And therefore as the Light principle, with all his branches, is said to be the Father of posi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore the Prophet said in the Text, mentioned before: <hi>Emittens verbum suum liquefacit ista,</hi>

So also the heat of the Easterly wind destroyeth and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateth the watery effects of the Westerly wind, and therefore the Prophet saith, <hi>Postquam veniente Euro,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Hos. 13.15.</note> 
                           <hi>vento IEHOVAE è deserto, exaruerit scaturigo ejus &amp; sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catus fuerit fons ejus: Afterwards by the Easterly wind of the Lord, coming from the desert, his spring withered, and his Fountain was dried up.</hi> As if he had said, the water was changed by the heat of that wind into Aire by rarefaction or subtiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus have you understood how these two opposit Vertues, namely Cold and Heat do spring from one and the same Spirit in radicall essence, by which it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth actually and essentially by a double property: Forasmuch as they produce in the Catholick Element of the sublunary world, opposite effects, to effect the will of the Creator in the Aire, and upon the Earth and Seas. Now I will speak a word or two of the Procreation or Generation of such passive Natures, as are brought forth by the mutuall action and opposition of the two foresaid essentiall Vertues, which do spring and have their root or beginning, either in the Divine Nature's <hi>Nolunty</hi> and privative existence, or <hi>Volunty</hi> and positive emanation.</p>
                        <p>These passive qualities do essentially depend upon the former, and do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise belong unto them, then the female or passive do unto the male or active. And first I will tell you my mind touching the birth of Humidity, and afterward I will come to speak of Siccity. We must imagine, that when there was no formall Light to inact the deformed Abysse or Chaos, and consequently no Heat to act and make a division of Light from Darkness; then all the dark Chaos was inclining unto drouth and wet, congealed with cold: For cold hath an infinite power and dominion, where Heat is absent, as we see about the Northen Pole, all the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are frozen into a dry and cold clod or heap, by reason of the absence of the Sun's heat. In like manner where the Sun, or burning Easterly winde, doth send forth directly their spiracles of Heat, there Cold is banished, and the Earth is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a dry, thirsty, and spongy masse. Even so and after the like pattern, are those; or rather these after those patterns: For the Chaos was a confused, a cold and a dry heap, untill the Light did appear, and began to operate. Also the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57108:32"/>
Light of it self, as it was considered without any action upon the passive masse, was of a fiery condition, that is to say, heat and drouth did only appear in it: it followeth therefore; that, as cold in effect is nothing else but the act of the divine puissance made potent and evident by the absence of Heat: So also is drouth or dryness nothing else but an apparent passive nature, evermore accompanying the two foresaid active powers in their absolute intention, where moysture is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally absent. Now moysture is as it were a mongrell, begotten between the two opposite actives, which is proved thus. The North wind by his dominion turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Aire into Snow, Hail, Ice or Frost, that is, into a cold and dry Substance. But when the Southerly or Easterly wind, doth begin to have dominion, then their blasts do penetrate, by little and little, the said dry masses or substances, and undoeth them, and coverteth them into a moist or humid nature, according unto the tenor of those forementioned words of <hi>David: So soon</hi> (saith he) <hi>as he bloweth forth his wind, the waters flow. So soon as he sendeth forth his Word, they are liquefied.</hi> So that moisture is nothing else but a mixtion of heat and cold, in one solid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which is fluxible <hi>in potentia,</hi> and then by little and little doth the cold and drouth depart, and become faint, according as the power of the wind is more or less vigorous in Heat. For thus much we must observe, that as cold doth make immobil and fix; So it is an evident signe, that the Southern or Eastern Heat hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken possession of the Mass, when by their action it beginneth to moysten, to revive and move again: forasmuch as nothing doth effect that function but Heat. In the very same manner also, the increated and all-creating Spirit of Light, moving up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the dark abysse, did operate in it, and made the congealed Mass to relent, and then it was called by <hi>Moses,</hi> waters; and by <hi>Hermes, humida natura,</hi> or <hi>the humid nature.</hi> And so they continue unto this day, being altered from one nature unto another, according unto the will of God, which he effecteth by his Ministers, the Angelicall winds, causing the Spirituall waters to change, and wheel about from one nature into another. And we must observe in these chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that even the visible waters, were first made and derived from the invisible wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, according unto St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s doctrine before mentioned: For Heaven was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sea and Earth, which were as it were the feces, dregs, or grosser part of the catholick Sublunary Element.</p>

                        <p>Before we proceed unto our ocular demonstration, which shall be made in and by our Experimentall instrument, we must consider in the first place, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Aire or Sublunary Heaven, is the subtiler and more spiritual portion of those waters, which are under the Firmament, of which division <hi>Moses</hi> maketh mention, and therefore every particular thereof doth correspond unto the whole, and consequently the aire included in the glass of the Instrument, is of the same nature, as is that of the whole Catholick Aire; and therefore by reason of their continuity, as the excluded whole fareth, so also doth the included part. Again, as the Spirit which walked upon the waters did animate, vivify, inform, and dilate them giving them motion: So also by his absence, or by hiding its act or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting its emanating beames into it self, the waters are also contracted, condensed and darkned, as it appeareth by the Northern wind's property, which proceedeth from the privative or contractive action of this Spirit. But as the waters do by their existence fill the vaulted cavity of the world: So also doth the all-inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit fill every corner of them, insomuch as being it operateth all in all, but in a diversity of property, (and therefore it is termed <hi>multiformis Sapientia</hi>); so sometimes it operateth in its privative property in these lower waters, as is already told you, namely when it bloweth from the North and West, and sometimes in his positive nature; as when it breatheth from the South or East. In the first, by his cold action he contracteth from the circumference unto the center, as is said; by the last, namely by his hot property, he dilateth from the center to the circumference. Seing then that it is water, that is the Catholick passive, out of the which, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the common Subject of all things, the shape of the whole world, and every thing therein, was and is carved out and fashioned, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> telleth us and that the eternall creating and all-inacting Spirit of the Lord, is the universall acto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

fire, &amp;c. as in many places of Scripture we find it, it must needs follow, that he is the agent, as well in the contraction and dilatation generally, without the Glasse, as particularly within the Glasse. Wherefore as the Sun, the hot winds, the fire, or naturall heat of mans body, have their dilative property from his emanating and inacting vertue, and do alter by it the cold aire, the winds, and water from his privative disposition: So it followeth, that as well the dilatation of the aire in the Glasse, as contraction, is the immediate act of this Spirit's positive or privative property; for when this Spirit bloweth from the North or West, the aire is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted more or lesse into a narrower room within the Glasse, and that is proved thus, namely, because the water is drawn up higher into the neck of the Glasse, lest a corporall vacuity should be admitted in nature. And again, it is most apparent, that the aire in the Glasse is by so much the more contracted, by how much the Northern cold hath dominion in the outward aire, because it is gathered into a more strait place o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On the other side, if the hot winds, or Summer Sun, do inflame the externall aire, then the included aire will also dilate it self, and in its dilation require a larger space. That the aire is so dilated by heat, it is plainly demonstrated, in that the water is struck down by so many degrees lower than it was. Again, if one put his hand on the top of the ball of the Glasse, the water will sinke, for the aire will forthwith be dilated. Now that the spirit of life, which giveth this heat unto Man or Beast, is from this eternall Spirit, which (as the Apostle saith) <hi>doth vivifie all things,</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do in many places, above and hereafter mentioned, confirm. Again, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet calleth this one <hi>Spirit from the four winds, to breathe into the dead carcases that they might live again.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ezek. 37.9.</note> Thus you see it evidently confirmed by an ocular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, that cold doth contract, inspissate, and make gross the included aire, which is argued by the drawing up of the water, and straitning the aire. And again, that heat doth dilate and dissipate, by the enlargement of the aire in hot weather, or by laying of the hand on the bolts head, which is made evident by the beating down of the waters.</p>
                        <p>Note (I beseech you), ye that will not be over-partiall on the Peripateticks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfes, the two notable errours of the Aristotelians: whereof the first is manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in that they hold for a Maxim, that <hi>calidum</hi> doth <hi>congregare homogenea, heat doth congregate and gather together things of one nature.</hi> Now you see it here ocularly demonstrated, that heat doth operate the contrary; for it dissipateth and disperseth the aire, which is of homogeneall parts, and therefore it doth not congregate it: But it is cold that doth congregate, compact, and gather homogeneall things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well as heterogeneall. For you see, in our Instrument, that it contracts and gathers together the aire, yea, and water, in a straiter and narrower place.

                        <p>The other of their palpable errours is also described by this ocular experiment, for whereas they say, that the Sun, starrs, and Fire, yea, and all heat whatsoever, doth attract and draw unto it the vapours and humidity of the earth, waters, &amp;c. we find the contrary by this our experimentall Glass; for in onely laying the warm hand upon the Glass, the aire dilates it self immediately, and is so far from being attracted by the heat, that contrariwise it flyeth away from the hand: And that this is so, it appeareth by the striking down or precipitation of the water, as is said. Thus have we sufficiently mentioned, in this present Book, the estate of the first and second Principles of all things, and that but in brief tearms; because my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is, to touch them with a more large and copious style, in the first Book of my Sympatheticall and Antipatheticall History.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have made it (as I imagine) most plain and evident unto your understandings, as well by the testimony of the antique Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and infallible wisdom of holy Writ, as by ocular demonstration, that the common, or universall matter and subject of all things, was the Waters, which were inacted and created by the bright Spirit of the Lord, before all things: Which being so, and for that all Condensation and Rarefaction do regard a subject or materiall substance, wherein it should be performed or effected, it followeth therefore, that the onely matter which doth endure or suffer the act of either of them, must be water, or a humid and moist nature, being it is the onely substantiall stuff, which filleth all the vast cavity of the world, and consequently the materiall existence, of which both Heaven and Earth, and all things therein, are framed, and were originally sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out. This is therefore that main subject of Condensation and Rarefaction, by the means whereof, all things in this world are made to differ from one another, and are disposed and ordered by God, according to weight, number, and measure, in their proper rancks and places; that is, they are placed in a higher or lower regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according unto that dignity, which the catholick or eternall Actor hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon them in their creation. The common matter therefore of incrassation and subtiliation being thus made manifest, we are to finde out the universall actor or operator in this work. And I did signifie unto you before, that it was the sacred emanation of that divine splendour, which did operate from all beginnings, and doth at this present operate, and shall hereafter work all that which hereafter shall be effected, in the heavens above, and the earth beneath; which assertion of mine accordeth well with this axiom of the Apostle, oftentimes, and that not without a just occasion,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.6. Psal. 104.25. Wisd. 8.5. Heb. 1.3. 2 Pet. 3.5. Ephes. 4.10. Col. 3.11. Wisd. 7.24.</note> repeated by me, <hi>Deus operatur omnia in omnibus, God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all in all.</hi> And <hi>David, In sapientia omnia fecisti, Thou hast made all things in thy wisdom.</hi> And <hi>Solomon, Sapientia operatur omnia, Wisdom worketh all things.</hi> And the Apostle in another place, <hi>Christus portat omnia verbo virtutis suae, Christ beareth all things by the word of his vertue.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter, The heavens were of old, and the earth of waters and by waters, consisting by the word.</hi> Again, St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>Christ is in all, and filleth all.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Christus omnia est, &amp; in omnibus; Christ is all, and in all.</hi> Now this holy spirit of wisdom is said to be, <hi>omnibus mobilibus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilior, more swift and movable than any movable thing.</hi> And therefore he must needs act all in all, according unto his will and pleasure. Again, when he is pleased to withdraw his actuall beams within himself, he seems to rest, and the act of the creature doth cease, and then death doth ensue, namely, cessation from the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of life. Now being he is the most agil and moovable of all things, the vertue of heat doth evermore accompany the motions of his light, yea, and are essentially united unto the actor: even as we see in the Sun, (which <hi>Sydrach</hi> the wise-man compareth with Divinity, saying, that the body is likened unto the Father, the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57108:33"/>
the beams or emanation unto the Sun, and the active heat which issueth from them both unto the Spirit) that the beam is continuate unto the body of the Sun, as the emanation from the divine fountain, is one individuall essence with the fountain of eternall light; and the virtue issuing from the Sun and his beams, is in like manner unseparable in essence from the other two; even as we find, that the holy Spirit which is emitted from Father and Son, is one in essence with them both. For this reason therefore, the divine Philosopher <hi>Hermes</hi> saith, <hi>Mens ab essentia Dei ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaquam divisa,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pim. 12.</note>

I conclude therefore, that Rarefaction is nothing else, but the dilating of water by heat, which was first contracted by cold; and Condensation, on the other side, is a contraction, or sucking and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of those watry parts, which were dilated or dispersed by heat: So that the subject of both these actions is water, and the fountain, as well of the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as positive agent, is the Nolunty or Volunty, that is to say, the negative or affirmative will of that one eternall Unity, who is that all-informing and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Spirit, which acteth and accomplisheth his pleasure in all and over all, by his divers organs, as well angelicall as celestiall and elementary: which, according unto their diversity in disposition, are moved by this internall act, to operate in this world the will of the Creator, both positively and privatively, as shall be told you in the Chapter following.</p>

                        <p>How this Divine spirit or <hi>Ruach Elohim</hi> being but one in Essence, worketh both by his Angelicall, and Astrall organs in this sublunary world, after a four-fold manner.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Eternall spirit of wisdome, who is the initiall principle of all things; and in whom and by whom,<note place="margin">Colos. 1.16.</note> (as the Apostle teacheth us) <hi>the Angels, Thrones, pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states and dominations were Created,</hi> doth operate by his Angelicall Organs of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary fortitude, in the Catholick Element of the lower waters; both the effect of Condensation, and that of Rarefaction. And to verifie this out of the holy Bible's, testimony, we read first, that this one spirit is the arch- Lord and Prince of the 4. winds, or else the Prophet by the commandement of God would not have said; <hi>Come O spirit from the</hi> 4. <hi>winds and make these dead Carcasses to live againe.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 37.9.</note> Now that this one spirit worketh in, and by spirituall and Angelicall Organs, in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is effected by the property of the 4. winds, it is proved out of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps,</hi> where we find these words: <hi>I saw</hi> 4. <hi>Angels stand on the</hi> 4. <hi>Corners of the Earth holding the</hi> 4. <hi>winds of the Earth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 7.1.</note> that they should not blow on the Earth neither on the Sea, &amp;c. By which it is evident that these Angelicall Presidents over the 4. winds were the Ministers and Organs by and in the which the spirits or blasts of the winds were emitted or retained according unto the will of that eternall spirit, which guideth them when and where he list: But we find by daily observation that the essentiall vertue in the Northern spirit is cold, and therefore contractive or attractive from the circumference unto the centre, and by consequence a causer of congelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and condensation. By this kind of Angelicall vertue, the divine spirit doth work his privative effects, and acts of Inspissation and fixation in the sublunary Element, causing terrestriall and earthly effects. But contrariwise, we find that by and in the Southerne and Easterly Angelicall spirits, the all-Creating and operating power doth cause Rarefaction and Subtiliation in the said inferiour waters, through their essentiall action which is heat. And for this cause the said hot winds do undoe by rarefaction all that which the cold Northern winds did effect by congelation. Hence therefore it commeth, that of this potent Angell (who is said by the wise Cabalists to be the President and Governour of the Celestiall Sun, which some terme <hi>Michael quasi Quis sicut Deus,</hi> of whom we will speak hereafter, also touching his Angelicall organs in the 4. Corners of the earth,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> by which he useth to do his will) it is sayed, <hi>The sonne of man will send out his Angels from the four winds of heaven</hi>: and moreover, we shall find in the place before mentioned, that this imperiall Angell

did rise from the Easterly angle of the world, and did command the foresaid fowr Angels which had dominion over the four winds, as vassals unto his will. For the Text hath it;<note place="margin">Apoc. 7.2.</note> 
                        <hi>And I saw another Angell come up from the East, and cryed with a loud voice unto the</hi> 4. <hi>Angels unto whom power was given, &amp;c. Hurt not the earth, neither the seas, nor the trees till I have sealed, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby it is apparent that the 4. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the winds are subject unto that great Angell, who is the powerfull and potent Intelligence which moveth and ruleth not only the Sun but sustaineth all things by vertue of this word; and this Almighty Angell is esteemed by some to be the same mentioned in the first Chapter of the <hi>Apocal.</hi> Who said, I am <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 1.</note> Now that the Sun by vertue of this omnipotent Spirit, whose immediate angelicall organ or instrument the Angell <hi>Michael</hi> is, doth govern the airy spirit, both of the lower and upper world, the wise <hi>Solomon</hi> doth seem to acknowledge, where he saith,<note place="margin">Ecclus. 1.3.</note>

It appeareth therefore, that the increated spirit, which supereminently moveth in the angelicall creature, <hi>Michael,</hi> (and therefore <hi>El,</hi> or <hi>Deus fortis</hi> is annexed unto it) is that self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same Princely Spirit specified by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> (as is already proved) who dwelleth in the great Angel, who rising up from the East, commanded the 4. gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the winds, with their legions: whereby it is manifest, that they have all their act and power from it, and are ordained to be employed onely at his will, either to effect privation or position, and consequently to produce condensation or rarefaction in the world, at his pleasure; namely, position and information by his light; and heat, and privation or deformation by his dark and cold property.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57108:34"/>
and altered from the Originall copy, and therefore construeth the Hebrew thus: <hi>In coelis posuit Soli tabernaculum: He made for the Sun a tabernacle in the heavens.</hi> And <hi>Tremellius</hi> expounds it: <hi>Soli disposuit tentorium in iis: He made the heavens a pavillion for the Sun.</hi> Verily if we consider all things rightly, we must imagine that either the Text must be altered and corrupted from that Originall copy, which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> had, or else the reverend <hi>Jerom</hi>'s worth must of necessity be called into question, for so grosse a mistaking. Touching the petson; surely the whole Christian Church in his days, would not have made election of a man of mean skill in the Hebrew lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, to undergo a task of such importancy, being for the main good of the whole Christian Church, as was the translation of the Bible out of Hebrew into Latin. It would not (I say) have relied upon a man of small cunning, either in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew language or mysteries of divinity, to judge of the likelyhood or coherence of the Scripture's Harmony; and therefore the ability of the person, unto whose charge so great a business was committed, and consequently the fruits of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours could no way be undervalued, being compared unto either <hi>Pagnine</hi> or <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius.</hi> Again, that he was held for a person of holy conversation, the title of Sainct, which is attributed unto him, doth confirm and argue.

Again, no man can deny but that the Pope and whole Christian Clergy did assist him in this business, with all the antique books or manuscripts, which might direct him into the true way or sense of interpretation; so that he wanted not the consent of antique Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but could discern between the true and corrupt Text in his interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore that we may neither accuse the later interpreters for their expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, nor derogate from St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s labours, which deserve an everlasting monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we must rather impute the errour unto the corruption or alteration of the Hebrew Text, being that the whole harmony of the Scriptures, and main subject of the Psalm in which it is recited, do tend and incline rather unto the constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> as I will particularly prove and expresse unto you by these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments following.

Then from the resolution of the ancient <hi>Theologians</hi> with other circumstances belonging unto them. Fourthly, from an <hi>Astonomicall</hi> observation, and the dignity and excellency of the solar creature. Fifthly, from an <hi>Arithmeticall</hi> consideration. Sixtly, from the point and circle in <hi>Geometry.</hi> Seventhly, from the consonant of the greatest perfection in <hi>Musick</hi> or harmony. Eighthly from a Physicall or naturall regard. And lastly, by the asseverations of the wisest and divinest Philosophers, which accord exactly with the Symphony of Scriptures. Of each of those therefore in their order.</p>
                     <p>As for the first Argument, it is evident that the main Subject of this Psalm, doth touch the revelation of Divinity or God in his celestiall creatures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must as well be in this Psalm intended, that the divine Spirit doth plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and that essentially inhabit this illustrious palace of the heavenly Sun, as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57108:35"/>
there it is related that the heavens are full of his presence. But the same Psalm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth thus,<note place="margin">Psal. 19.1.</note> 
                        <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament the works of his hands,</hi> &amp;c. Where he expresseth that the glory of the Creator which is in the creature doth reveal the Creator in the creature; but where the glory is present, the essence is not absent: And thereupon it followeth justly, that this Creator which hath filled the Sun of Heaven, with his glory and beauteous influence of essentiall vertue and light, hath revealed himself unto all the world, out of his Sunny tabernacle egregiously and perspicuously, as by the Physicall and naturall effects it shall be declared hereafter in the eighth rank. Again, the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> confirms this more plainly where he saith:<note place="margin">Ecclus. 42.16.</note> 
                        <hi>Sol illuminans per omnia respexit; &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Domini plenum est opus ejus: The Sun shining forth looketh over all, and it is a work that is full of the glory of the Lord:</hi> that is to say, of essentiall Divinity, not that it is included in it, but that also it is exclusively in and over all, no otherwise then the Spirit of mans blood is said to have his principall tabernacle in the Heart, and yet is in all and every part of the Spirit and body. Again, it appeareth by these words, that the Eternall Spirit of Wisdome did elect the celestiall Sun, as a pure vessell or Subject, to operate and act in, for the vivification and animation of every creature.<note place="margin">Ecclus. 24.5.</note> And therefore she, in her own person, saith, <hi>Ex ore Altissimi prodii primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genita; in coelis feci ut oriretur lumen indeficiens: I came out of the mouth of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, being the first b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Touching the second, which dependeth on the cabalisticall enucleation of the Hebrew word, for the Latin word <hi>Sol</hi> or the <hi>Sun</hi> in English, is written thus in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Mem</hi> in the middle, which importeth a watry corpulency, for <hi>Mem</hi> is the SYmbolicall expression of the waters; as if we should say, that the humid nature of the heavens being contracted in their center, is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated with a double proportion of the divine emanation streaming down, or flowing from the <hi>Sephiroth</hi> or Cabalisticall numeration, called <hi>Tiphereth</hi> or pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritude and beauty. Whereby it is argued, that this heavenly mass is made a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle for the Spirituall Sun or beauteous and divine Spirit of Light, not that it includeth it, as is said before, but, as the Scriptures say, that the holy Spirit was in the carnall Christ abundantly, and yet it was not denied for all that to fill the earth and heavens.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Sap. 1. <hi>Resol. Theolog. Tract.</hi> 2. <hi>Pars</hi> 2. <hi>Port.</hi> 2. <hi>q.</hi>
                        </note>Concerning the third: The <hi>Theologians</hi> do affirm, that the Light which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansed over all the heavens, and did operate in place of the Sun, for the first three daies space, was at the fourth day congregated into the body of the Sun. But this Light which was so dispersed, was the immediate act of that Eternall Spirit which was carried on the waters; and therefore that Light which is in the Sun, doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate with divinity, as shall be more evidently expressed in the eighth and last Argument.</p>
                     <p>By the fourth, which is proved out of the Celestiall or Astronomicall dignity (which the Sun representeth) it is most evident that it comprehendeth in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion divinity, being that by how much the more perfection any thing hath in it self, and excelleth the rest in glory, by so much the more it approacheth unto divinity. For as much as <hi>Hermes</hi> doth rightly tell us, (not disagreeing in that from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ his doctrine) that <hi>Bonum</hi> and <hi>perfectum</hi> is onely God. Now the Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosmicall Sun's dignity and perfection is easily to be discerned, in that this Royall <hi>Phoebus</hi> doth sit in his chariot, even in the center or middle of the heavens, glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his golden hair, as the sole visible Emperour, holding the royall Scepter and government of the world, in whom all the vertue of the celestiall bodies do consist, as <hi>Jamblicus,</hi> and many other learned personages have confirmed. And <hi>Proclus</hi> averreth, that all the powers of the starrs are congregated and collected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one at the aspect of the Sun, the which are afterward disseminated by the fiery spiracle of the said Sun upon the Earth. Doth not the Wiseman also by reason of the glory of this heavenly vessell or organ, compare the brightness of the in-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirit or fiery emanation of divinity with it, by reason of his excellency in brightness?<note place="margin">Wisd. 7.24. Ecclus. 42.16.</note> And again, is it not proved before, by the Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> that the Fabrick of the Sun is full of the glory of the Lord? But I will say more unto this point, in the eighth and last Argument.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:57108:35"/>The fifth sheweth, how by an Arithmeticall regard, Divinity must needs dwell in the Sun; namely, as it is onely one unity, from which all the multitude of the starrs in heaven do derive and draw their formall essence, no otherwise than from the Arithmeticall unity, all numbers whatsoever are produced; for the number two hath but the form of one and the same unity, twice conceived, and then one unity more maketh three, and so <hi>in infinitum.</hi> In the very like manner as one candle lighteth another, and a third, and so proceedeth <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Even so, this one heavenly Candle informeth with light and beauty, all the starry candles in heaven, and yet it reserveth still, without any detriment, his wonted unity in perfection, power, and glory.</p>
                     <p>By the sixt Argument (which is Geometricall) in regard that the Sun is a most bright circular body, it must needs be, that it hath a centrall point unto his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, in the which all his illuminating power doth consist, being that the circumference is nothing else, but a semi-diametrall dilatation of a punctuall and essentiall vertue, from the center unto the circumference. And this is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Axiom in Philosophy, <hi>In medio consistit virtus &amp; veritas.</hi> Now if that wonderfull beauty, and clear brightnesse which is in the Sun, were not extended from the center, it would not proceed <hi>à principio interno,</hi> and then it must, like as the Moon doth, require some other externall corporall illuminator; but that is proved to be otherwise, being that there is not any body found in the world, that is equall in brightnesse unto it. And this is an argument, that it hath a centrall divinity, or divine vertue in it, which like unto the soul in the center of the creature, vivifieth or acteth from the center unto the circumference thereof, and so making the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the body a fiery and bright <hi>coloratum,</hi> causeth it, according unto the infinity of its centrall agent, to extend his beamy emanation to all the limits of the vast world. Hence is it, that God is said to be the center of all, whose circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is no where; that is to say, in and over all, and beyond or without all. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let it seem strange unto any, that I say, the in-created light is visible, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his tabernacle which it endueth, being that Scriptures do testifie, <hi>that he is a consuming fire.</hi> And again, that <hi>the spirit of wisdom excelleth the sun and starrs in brightnesse.</hi> And again it is said, <hi>He is attired with light as with a vestment.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, he is <hi>fons &amp; pater luminis,</hi> and therefore there can be no light, either visible or invisible in this world, which is not from it. Doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> seem to aver, <hi>that all visible things were first from things that were not visible</hi>; whereby is argued, that all visible light was first from the invisible, whose fountain is God, the which invisible light is continued in essence unto his like in the creatures, as shall be shewed anone.</p>
                     <p>The seventh is confirmed by an observation in Musick, namely, that the divine Spirit hath elected the Sun for his tabernacle, to wit, by reason of his position in heaven. For if we consider, that God, as he is said to exist in himself, is reputed by Scripture to be seated <hi>in the heaven of heavens</hi>; and in another place, <hi>in the highest heavens, and yet he respecteth and looketh down unto the earth</hi>; In that regard we may compare him (<hi>si sacra cum mundanis componere fas sit</hi>) unto an unison in Harmony; for if a string of a musicall Instrument be struck open, it soundeth a unity from the bridge of the Instrument unto the nut or head: So we imagine, that a chord may be extended from the worlds circumference, or highest heavens, unto the center or earth. Again, if we presse the chord of the Instrument just in the middle, then each half chord being struck, will sound in a <hi>diapason</hi> unto the whole, and will prove the center or perfection unto each end of the chord, which will then point out, as it were, the circumference.</p>
                     <p>Now the consonant <hi>diapason</hi> is the most perfect accord of all others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noteth, that the middle betwixt the light or heaven, and the earth, is the seat of the greatest perfection, which doth correspond unto the unison as 1 doth to 2, which is <hi>in proportione dupla, in a double proportion.</hi> It followeth therefore, and by effect it appeareth, that the Sun is placed in this centrall seat, which correspondeth unto the whole, as 2 doth unto 1. because it is the opinion of all Astronomers, that the Sun is placed in the middle, or center of the heaven. Now how this perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord was mystically shaped out of the divine and radicall unity, or unison, which said, <hi>Fiat,</hi> and it was done, I beseech you observe: Unity said, <hi>Fiat,</hi> and so this unison caused a divine emanation, which made 2. and had the self-same regard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unity, as the <hi>diapason</hi> or perfection hath unto an unison. Now this bright ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by the which all things were created and framed in true harmony, elected
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57108:36"/>
in this world the perfect seat of its royall regard unto all creatures, in the point of <hi>diapason,</hi> which is ever in the middle of the unison, and therefore in the center of the heavens. But it appeareth unto the eyes, that the Sun is ranked in the middle of the seven Planets; and again, it appeareth by the divine glory which shineth from it, that it is a seat of divine perfection: and therefore the Platonists have imagined, that the Solar orbe or sphear is the seat of their <hi>anima mundi,</hi> or <hi>soul of the world.</hi> Now as this royall and most consonant <hi>Diapason,</hi> doth comprehend in his capacity the other two inferior accords in Musick, namely, <hi>Diapente,</hi> and <hi>Diatessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> (for of these two united is the <hi>Diapason</hi> composed) it is likely, that the whole harmony of the heavens, and consequently of the world, are put in practise in this created organ, the actor or player whereon is the eternall Spirit, which soundeth out every minute from this his glorious Instrument, straines of life, vivification, multiplication, pacification or preservation, unto the creatures; for this is the office of the eternall Christ in this world, I mean, the divine Word, in the which, as the Evangelist <hi>John</hi> testifieth, is life. But of this, in the next.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, it is proved by a physicall or naturall regard: For we observe, and not we onely, but the beasts themselves; nay, the very herbs and vegetable plants of the earth, do feel, and as it were confesse, that the Sun is the chiefest treasury of vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and multiplication in this world. Whereupon it is apparent, that when the Sun approacheth near us, the herbs and trees which seemed as dead before, do now revive, put on their green coats, and flourish with their blossoms and flowers: But contrariwise, when it departs on the other side of the <hi>Aequinoctiall,</hi> they put off their flowers and green apparell, and begin to mourn, as it were, for his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But, saith St. <hi>Paul, Deus vivificat omnia, God doth vivifie all things.</hi> And therefore if the Sun by his presence bringeth unto the world the vertue of vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it is apparent, that it hath this gift from the Spirit of God, which is the Spirit of life, and being abundantly poured on it by God into this heavenly vessell, it doth effect these vivifying acts in the world, no otherwise, than the same spirit being affluently infused on <hi>Christ, Moses, Elijah,</hi> and other Saints upon earth, did effect wonders upon the earth, in healing, reviving from death, &amp;c. Doth not the sacred Text also aver, that <hi>Sapientiam Deus effudit supra omnia opera sua secundum da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum suum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccles. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>God hath poured out his spirit upon all his works, more or lesse.</hi> Why then should any man make any scruple or question, touching the Spirit's habitation in the Sun in abundance. This therefore is the chiefe subject of this Psalme of <hi>David,</hi> to expresse, that the glory of God doth palpably appear, out of the creatures of heaven, yea, out of every creature the eternall Spirit doth shine, or expresse his glory more or lesse, and is, according to the gift which is given unto him, to be discerned out of it: And thereupon <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>Coelos ornavit Deus Spiritu suo,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job. 26.13.</note> 
                        <hi>God hath adorned or beautified the heavens with his Spirit.</hi> By which words it is manifest that it is the essentiall spirit of God, which giveth by the abundance of his presence the lustre and glory unto the Sunne, which for that reason is termed, and that not erroneously, by the Platonists, (who therein have imitated the divine Poet <hi>Orpheus,</hi>) <hi>Oculus mundi,</hi> because that in and by it as in a certain clear and smooth looking glasse or mirrour, all things are seen and discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: And again the philosopher <hi>Heraclitus, Si solem è mundo sustuleris, quid est nostrum Corpusculum, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So also it appeareth by effect that the vertue, vegetation, and conservation of all things both inferiour and superiour, doth issue and spring from the Sun, forasmuch as it imparteth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spireth by his light, life, and heat unto inferiour things and bestoweth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall light unto the superiour. Now this light is a certain simple act, which converteth unto it self all things, by a vivificall or lively heat, which penetrateth all things,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.4. 1 Tim. 6.13. Act 17.25. Judeth. 16.17. Sap. 7.22. 1 Cor. 12. Sap. 7.24.</note> and conducteth their vertues over all, and withall disperseth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth away all darknesse and obscurity. Whereby it is apparent, that <hi>if the life in generall be in the word,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> saith; and if <hi>this catholick spirit of life vivifieth all things,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Judith</hi> affirm; and if the <hi>spirit of wisdom be brighter than the sun, and a simple and pure spirit, which is more movable and active than all things, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57108:36"/>
therefore operateth all in all</hi>; and if <hi>it penetrateth all things by reason of his purity,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, and all these properties are found in the solar vertue; What should disswade man from thinking, that the Hebrew Text was not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of <hi>Jerom,</hi> when he interpreted it, <hi>Posuit tabernaculum suum in sole, He put his tabernacle in the sun</hi>? Verily this was necessary for man to understand, being that unto this very hour, there are but few that will acknowledge, that the Spirit of God doth immediately operate and work in his organ the Sun, and by the Sun; but being rather seduced by the Ethnick learning, they will admit many subalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate agents, or efficient causes, <hi>per se,</hi> that is, <hi>of themselves,</hi> distinguished from the essentiall act of God, which is the reason of Idolatry, and worshipping of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the Creator, and neglect or ignorance of the Creator in the creature.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57108:37"/>
that his everlasting vertue and divinity is in the creatures, and that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth out of them. For his words import that the invisible things of him, are discerned by the things that are created, as also his everlasting vertue and divinity. And why not? being that in the Word is and was from the beginning life, or the vivifying Spirit, but life is in the creatures, Ergo the Word, and by consequence the incorruptible Spirit. But <hi>Solomon</hi> confirmeth the above mentioned place in this:<note place="margin">Wisd. 13.1.</note> 
                        <hi>All men are vain by nature who are ignorant of God, and cannot understand him that truly is, by such good creatures of his which they behold, nor acknowledg the workman by the consideration of his works.</hi> Wherby he argueth, that divinity in the creature may be perceived, in and by the aspect of the creature. Wherefore it is evident that the Prophet said rightly, when he did affirm that <hi>the heavens did declare the Glory and Majesty of God,</hi> by the beauteous apparition of that glorious Spirit, which did inact them, and adorn their beauteous Eie, I mean the Sun, with such divine vivifying and illuminating vertue, which in aboundance doth possesse and inhabit it. And therefore I conclude, that the Prophet said rightly, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctingly unto the ignorant world; that the bright Spirit of God did dwell in the Sun of heaven, as in a Tabernacle, and did impart and distribute his gifts of form, life, vegetation, and multiplication, unto every creature out of it.

And this is good doctrine which arrogateth all vivifying actions, as well immediate as mediate soly unto him, who wholly acteth, and effecteth all things, and consequently not unto the created organ, in which and by which he operateth: for in doing the contrary we shall derogate from the Creator, to ascribe that which indeed is not unto the creature. As for the later interpretation which saith: <hi>Soli posuit tentorium in coelis: He made the Sun a pavillion or tabernacle in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi> What profit (I beseech you) can that doctrine bring unto man? The first Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation teacheth man, that the Spirit of God is in this bright creature of heaven, and therefore teacheth us to adore the Lord, and not the palace, being that the ignorance of the divine Spirit's being, in the beauteous creatures, hath been the occasion of infinite errours in the world. And therefore it is an interpretation of especiall moment and instruction.</p>
                     <p>The Second is a thing so triviall, that it needed no such curiosity of expression to signify that the Sun hath his seat or place in heaven. Alass, what child knoweth not this by an ocular direction, without any such precept of the Prophet? And what is this pertinent unto the Text going before, <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. Why should he mention the Sun immediatly afterward? What? To tell us that the Sun was in heaven? A thing known unto every man. No, but that the heaven's beauty was derived from that glorious Spirit of God which had chiefly his abiding or dwelling in the sunny Tabernacle, that thereby blind worldly men, might discern that it was God, in that beauteous creature, and not the creature, which sent down so affluently those vertuous influences and lights, which were effused out of the vessell of the Sun; being that by the mistaking of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, so many of Gods creatures, which he framed out after his own Image, have been seduced into errour, and allured ignorantly to adore the Sun, and other Starrs, for Gods. Which in verity are nothing of themselves. <hi>Spiritu suo ornavit coelos</hi> (saith <hi>Job</hi>), He doth not say <hi>Sole,</hi> but <hi>Spiritu suo,</hi> which made the Sun its Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.

Yea verily, he is said <hi>to be a consuming fire.</hi> I conclude therefore, that <hi>Jerom</hi> hath translated that place according unto the true sense, and consequently we may gather the reason of Rarefaction and Condensation from the presence or absence of the the Sun, and confess, after the due examination of the case, that the onely Agent of these two operations in the waters or catholick Element, is the Eternall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's presence, action and emanation, or his absence and rest. And this is easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by our experimentall glass: for the nearer the Sun is unto us, and the deeper we are in Summer, the more will the aire in the glass be dilated, which is manifested therefore, because that in summer-time the water is beaten down, and precipitated lowest. Again, the further the Sun is from us, and the deeper we are in winter, the more is the aire condensed in the glass; and that is made evident by the elevation or exaltation of water in the neck of the mattrass or glass. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we say that the whole reason of Condensation and Rarefaction doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Spirit in the Sun onely, being that the same Spirit is as well present in this Elementary region as aethereall, and hath the power and life of the winds in his rule, by which both in the winter and summer, he exalteth or depresseth the waters in the glass, and consequently causeth Condensation and Rarefaction of the aire, as well included in the Instrument as excluded; and by that means caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a diuturnall change in the generall Sublunary Waters, or catholick Element of aire, after a four-fold nature, from one condition unto another.

                        <note place="margin">Heb. 11.3.</note> who teacheth us, <hi>that things visible were first of things invisible,</hi> we are instructed that both the visible bodies in heaven, and also all visible lights were first of invisible waters, and invisible formall Light, which hath its root in God, the bright eternall Unity of all created numbers; and therefore, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that <hi>Stellae</hi> are <hi>densiores partes sui orbis.</hi> So I say, that as the Substance of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens is invisible by reason of its rarity; in like manner are the starrs visible by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their density: For it was Condensation that caused visibility; and Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which is the occasion of invisibility. And yet for all this, it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that the starrs are the denser parts of their orbs, but rather Lights which were included in the spirit of the dark shadow of the abysse; which spirit in separating of Light from Darkness, sored upward by vertue of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Light, and so according unto the proportion of that eternall formall fire,

which it retaineth unto this day, as his corner-stone; it is sustained and elevated in its proper place, no otherwise then we see that the artificiall squib according unto the proportion of its artificiall and fading fire, with the ponderosity of its body, is, during the time of the gunpowders force, raised in the aire to a certain height, moving neither lower nor higher, then the form all vigor affordeth it vertue, and there remaineth untill the force of the corruptible and wasting fire be spent; and then it falleth down againe: But the Light of the star carrieth and raiseth up the spirituall body, according unto the proportion of the mounting Light, which soreth as high as its power and the ponderosity of the body will permit, and so it hangeth perpetually at a certain distance from the center; because the fire is of an eternall and incorruptible nature, and will not fade as that artificiall fire of the squib doth.

So there is none of all those Lights which are separated or divided in essence from that glorious and glittering Spirit, whose beams were dispersed over all the waters in the abysse, in giving of them life and being. For this reason therefore (because each Light had a diversity in proportion of formall brightness and measure of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulency) it is, that one celestiall body doth vary in his manner of vertue, motion, and influence from another; but because the extracted quintessence or purer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall essence of all the Chaos, with the purity of Light, that issued from the creating Spirit, were united into an Angelicall alterity, both of those natures in the figure of one masse, sored up out of the dark abysse into the heaven's center, where they challenged the Royall <hi>Phoebaean</hi> Throne, and that Sphaericall masse is to this hour termed the Sun of Heaven, which as from the created Fountain of Light enflameth and formally enlightneth all the rest of the Starrs in the heavens above, and the Element and elementated creatures below. So that after the universall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Light was effected the fourth day of the Creation, it was ordained to be that capitall Organ of life and vegetation in the starry world, which did send and showre down his influences and fiery spiracles of life, conservation, vegetation, and multiplication upon the sublunary earth and waters.</p>
                     <p>Thus therefore in few words, you have the reason of that Condensation and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction, whereby both the invisible heavenly Substance, and visible celestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were made. And it seemeth not to disagree from the opinions of the learned Theologians, <hi>Basil</hi> and <hi>Damascene,</hi> touching the causes of the divine Spirit's acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Condensation and Rarefaction, before the apparition of the Sun in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: Forasmuch as they will have the daie's Rarefaction, or cleare heaven to be occasioned by an emission of Light, ordained by the divine will or act of this Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Spirit: But they think that the night's Condensation, and the opake or condensed bodie in the heavens are effected by a contraction of Light, which was also caused by the sacred Spirit's volunty. Thus therefore we see out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of certain of the prime Fathers of the Church,<note place="margin">

                        </note> what was the cause of the cold condensing Night, and the hot rarifying Day, before the Spirit was congregated into the Tabernacle or quintessentiall substance of the Sun, which was extracted by the Spage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore this also must be the reason of Condensation and Rarefaction unto this day: For as the Spirit in the Sun being far from us, and as it were contracting his beames in regard of us, unto himself, or absenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from our Hemisphere, so that the cold waters do incline unto the nature of their mother Chaos, by reason whereof the night and darkness are long, and the light and day but short and faint in heat: So also in that season the common sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary Element is subject to Condensation and Incr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <note place="margin">Heb. 11.3.</note> who saith, <hi>Per fidem agnovimus quod semper ita actum sit cum mundo per Verbum, ut ex iis quae videri non poterant fierent ea quae possunt videri: We know by faith, that it hath been ever acted with the world by the word, that those things which can be seen, were effected or made of those things which could not be seen.</hi> And again, <hi>Solomon</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Wisd. 11.18.</note> 
                           <hi>that the world was made of a matter that was not seen.</hi> But besides these proofs, we are taught by chymicall experience, that earth is nothing else but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated water; nor visible water any thing else, but invisible air, reduced by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densation to a visibility; nor fire any thing else, but ratified aire. And, in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, all the sublunary waters were in the beginning, but an invisible, humid, or watry spirit, which we call by a common name, <hi>Aire</hi>; and consequently the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick sublunary element was in its originall, nothing else but one aire, being that heaven was made before the seas or the earth, as <hi>Moses</hi> teacheth us. And therefore by faith we must believe, according unto St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s doctrine, that all visible things, and therefore the seas and the earth, were first made or produced out of things not visible; that is to say, aeriall or heavenly: For it is one universall aire, that filleth the vast cavity or vault of the world, which by reason of its levity, tenuity, or invisibility, is called Heaven; as contrariwise the earth and seas are so termed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their gravity, density, and visibility. Since therefore it is evident, that the catholick sublunary aire, is the main materiall ground and substance of that, which the world calleth elements; and that it is altered and changed from one estate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, by the Word or divine Spirit <hi>Ruach Elohim,</hi> I mean, by the eternall wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; let us consider with our selves, how this potent Spirit doth effect in that one and the same homogeneall invisible, thin water or aire, such Protean trans-mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby there is an evident rotation made in it, out of one nature into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are therefore tearmed distinct elements.

By wisdom he giveth weight unto the aire, hangeth or ballaenceth the waters in it by proportion and measure, bindeth fast the thick clouds, so that they cleave not, giveth lawes unto the rain, and maketh a way unto the lightnings of the thunders.</hi> By which words we may conceive, that the invisible aire is the main subject on which the all-operating Spirit of God worketh, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the fore-named visible effects, and that onely by Condensation or Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57108:39"/>
which is insinuated, by giving weight unto the aire. For by Condensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he converteth the invisible aire into visible clouds, and then by a profounder degree of thickening, those vaporous clouds are condensed into raine, and the thicker and more unctuous part of the cloud is concreted into a hard stone or earth: So that out of the invisible aire, we see evidently by condensation produced three degrees of visible substance, namely, a vaporous aire, a thick visible water, which is rain, and a dense and ponderous earth, which is the stone called <hi>Lapis ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauneus,</hi> or Thunder-bolt, ingendred by the Spirit of God in that fight which is made in the conflict, between the liquifying nature of the fire, and congealing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the cold water. Again, on the other side, by rarefaction, the aire is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into fire, namely, into lightning; and all these receive their severall forms and changes, from the catholick nature of the invisible aire, into those shapes, in which after the alteration they abide. So that you may by this perceive, that all that which the antique Philosophers have termed Elements, are nothing else but a four-fold changing, and mutation of one and the same catholick element, or humid nature, unto the which, according as they in their changes do appear va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, have divers and sundry names, namely, of fire, water, and earth, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon them.

God sending forth his word upon the earth, it runneth swiftly; who bringeth forth the snow like wool, and disperseth the frost like ashes, and casteth down his ice like lumps; who is able to resist against his cold? Sending forth his word, he liquefieth or melteth all these, so soon as he bloweth forth his wind, the waters do flow forth, &amp;c.</hi> Out of which speech we may gather, first, that it is but one word or Spirit of God, which both by a northern contraction doth change the sublunary element into an earthly conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hard and visible consistence, namely, when he bloweth from the North, (and therefore saith <hi>Ab Arcturo egreditur frigus,</hi>

From the North commeth the cold, the mighty God doth bring forth ice by his breath, and coarcteth or straightneth the latitude of the waters</hi>) and also by a southern blast, doth melt and undo those terrestriall effects, which by his northern spirit it did produce and cause.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that the subject in which, and on the which it did operate, was the aire, which it did metamorphose and change from a soft, tender, light, volatil, transparent, thin, and invisible substance, into a hard, rough, heavy, fix, opake, thick, and visible masse.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that the word there is taken for the essentiall spirit of the wind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and therefore it is used as well to contract the aire into snow ice, or frost, as to dilate it. Again, the Psalmist saith, <hi>Angeli Dei faciunt verbum,</hi> &amp;c. Again, when he breatheth from the south, then this generall element becommeth vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, airy, humid, and hot, and will easily by the concourse of the northern forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, though in never so small a measure, be changed into clouds; for the southern blast is ever apt to undo the effects of the north, and so by their mutuall action, a middle nature of a westerly condition will be produced, namely, water, which is between aire and earth, as the western position is betwixt the south and north. But the southern blast of its own nature is hot and moist, as is the disposition of the catholick element of aire, or else the word being sent from that qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But when he worketh or operateth in his windy organs of the East, then they imprint upon the generall element a fiery character, and dilateth his substance into the nature and disposition of the fire, and then may it passe under the title of the Element of fire; as we have it confirmed out of many places of the holy Text, <hi>Praecepit Dominus</hi> (saith <hi>Jerom</hi>) <hi>vento calido &amp; urenti</hi>; or, as <hi>Tremellius</hi> hath it,<note place="margin">Jonas. 4.8.</note>

On the other side, the occidentall winds are found by experience to be opposite in nature and condition unto these; for they convert the hot aire or generall element into cold and naturall visible water, being that they are the procurers of cold raines: So that we may see by this, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall act in each Angell of the four corners of the earth,<note place="margin">Apoc. 7.1.</note> (of which the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> doth make mention) hath an essentiall vertue imparted unto it from God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto his volunty, at the instant of the Angels information; and therefore in that very property, doth the angelicall creature act in the common element, or lower waters, in the which the creating Spirit properly was, when he made it, so that the common element is daily informed anew, and altered, by the formall or essentiall act of the angelicall winde, which bloweth with dominion; insomuch as if the easterly angelicall wind informeth it, then it becommeth a fiery element, for it heateth and drieth by super-excellency: If a southerly, it is changed into that element's nature, which is called aire; and if a westerly spirit hath dominion, it is converted into the temper and proportion of water: Lastly, the Northern blast transmuteth it unto the consistence and disposition of earth.</p>
                        <p>By this therefore that maine doubt, which hath so long troubled the Peripateticks and hammered in their brains, and yet hath never been rightly resolved by them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day, may easily be undone and taken away; namely to find out the essentiall form of the Elements. For by this true Philosophy we find it to be an Angelicall Spiracle, or essentiall blast of wind infused by the Spirit of God diversly, into the aiery or spirituall vessell, to alter and change, according unto his will, the humid passive nature out of one condition into an other: Moreover the Catholick air being diversly so animated, bringeth forth and informeth a new, after the condition of his variety of animations, a multiplicity, and multiformity of <hi>Meteors</hi>: As for example the Easterly element brings forth children like it self. As are the fiery, and light <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors,</hi> namely Coruscations, Lightnings, Comets, and such like, according unto the nature of such Seminary influences, as shall descend from heaven at that instant. The Southerly, Vapours, Clouds, Lightning, with Thunders, The Westerly, Cold raines, and as it were Snowy resolutions. The Northenly, Frost, Snow, Ice, &amp; Hail.</p>
                        <p>But I know that this wil be objected against me, What then will you make of the Earth, and Seas? Are not these distinct Elements which have been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? I answer, that if they listen unto St <hi>Peters</hi> doctrine, he teacheth that <hi>the Earth was of waters,</hi> and therefore the waters were before the Earth; and again the heavens were made before the Earth, as <hi>Moses</hi> sheweth, and therefore the Earth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be the <hi>Foeces</hi> or the grosser part of the lower waters, and the visible wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the grosser part of the Ayre. For doth not the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> tell us in the Text
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57108:40"/>
before mentioned,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>that things visible were first of things invisib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>e</hi>? The change there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of all things visible or invisible, are effected by the Condensing or contracting faculty, and property in the all-acting spirit: And the reducing of them againe from a visible estate unto an invisible, is caused by the Rarifying or dilating act of the self same Spirit in essence, but differing in property: And therefore as air was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into water, and water into Earth, by the degrees of Cold; so also is Earth chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged insensibly into water, and water into Ayre, by the severall degrees of heat: for if this were not, how is it possible that so many waters falling from the Clouds, should not more and more augment the Seas, and diminish the Ayre? or why should so much Earthen Coals, and whole mountaines of wood, that are burnt not make the earth lesse in Consistence, if there were not an hourly supply, and transmutation of Ayre into water, and from water into Earth; which though this divine nature doth effect, secretly and insensibly, yet by effect it is proved true. For when the the wood and Coal is consumed, we shall find that their terrestriall Corpulency or bodily masse, is almost resolved by fire and heat; into watry smoke and fumish ayre. But the Philosophicall axiom is, that every thing is resolved into his first matter or principle; therefore it is apparent that both the water and aery smoke, which make up the Earthly bulk of a great Oake, or mountaine of pit-Coal, was first of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Ayre: Again, if these were not so, the brimstone, Stones, and dust, which, authority of the Bible and common experience teacheth to descend from heaven, being that they fall in one place or another daily, would increase the Earth more and more. But leaving these speculative proofs, I will descend unto such ocular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, as I have learned out of mine Experimentall glasse.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="demonstration">
                        <head>The Demonstration.</head>
                        <p>We find, that from the lower region of the Calender- or Weather-glasse, unto the summity or top of the head, there is nothing but a portion of the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible element, namely, the Aire within it: But we shall find even in this little modell of aire, strange mutations or alterations effected, by vertue of the four winds which blow in the open element; for when the hot Easterly wind doth blow, it dilateth and extendeth it self all along the neck of the Glasse, and beateth down the water unto the lowest degree, by reason of its extension, so that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth unto the nature of fire; for fire is said to be nothing else, but aire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly dilated, though indeed it is the abundant presence of the bright form which dilateth it so; but if the South-wind bloweth, then it will not be so extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dilated, but it will endue the mean nature of aire, and therefore it will draw up the water by certain degrees. But if it happen, that the westerly wind have the sole domininion in the sublunary element, then will the aire in the Glasse grow thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and for that reason it draweth or attracteth the water higher. For cold hath a great power in the said air, whose nature is to condense and thicken.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, if the cold northern winds do govern or dispose of this universall sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary element, then will the included aire be contracted or coarcted into a very strait room, which is argued in this, namely, because the colder the winde is, the higher will the water be elevated in the Glasse; and therefore it is made manifest, that by how much the more the aire is contracted, by so much the more it is thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and consequently it must be made ponderous, considering the proportion of place in which it is; for all the aire which weighed thus much in half a yard of Place, doth weigh at the least even so much in 2 inches of Space, after Contraction.</p>
                        <p>Thus you see, that in verity there is radically but one catholick sublunary Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though by the angelicall spirit that bloweth from the four corners of the heavens, it is four-foldly informed and altered, which made the Antients to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine in their phantasies, four distinct elements of an equall birth and beeing from all beginnings. But you see apparently by this that is said, that this position of the Peripateticks, and other sects, is false, though that it hath gotten an universall name and dominion in this world, among men as well of learning, as of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who ground their sayings on the doctrine of the learned of this world, who are corrupted and seduced from the truth, by the Ethnick discipline. I will now expresse unto you in the last place of this book, how all generation and corruption in this world is made; and that the lowest profundity, or <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> the motion of corruption tendeth, is but unto the simple element of nature; and then beginneth a new generation from that principle, being four-foldly altered,

according unto the nature of the four winds, and therefore when the dead carcas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses should live again,<note place="margin">Ezek. 37.9.</note> the Prophet said, <hi>Come from the four winds, O Spirit, and blow on these dead bones,</hi> that is inform and vivifie their Spirit with thy breath: for bones were made after a hard Northern and fixt manner, the humours after their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Westerly and Southerly property, namely flegm and blood; and lastly, the Spirit of life came from that all-vivifying fire, which <hi>Hermes</hi> calleth <hi>Splendorem Sanctum: The holy Splendor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To conclude, I will demonstrate the mystery of the worlds Creation, by way of an Arithmeticall progression, after this manner.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>Here we have the progression in the worlds Creation: where 1. signifieth the Unity which was before all things, which whilst it was in it self, and did not shine forth, conteined its inacting property within its potential <hi>Nolunty</hi> or Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and therefore was esteemed as nothing, in regard of mans weak capacity, although that in it self, it is all in all. Then the rank 2. sheweth the actuall ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the in-created Light, out of the potentiall Unity, at the presence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the humid nature did appeare out of the dark abysse 1. 0. in the shape of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, so that the light and waters as active and passive, are ranked next after Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thus,

then by the fiery Spirit of eternall love and union, those two opposit natures, are joyned together, into the nature of heaven, by a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all union, or composition: the which is termed by the Platonicks, the soul of the world, which the Philosophers have styled by the name of <hi>Quinta essentia,</hi> the quintessence.

which importeth the four-fold alteration of the catholick Element by the four Winds, which was and is effected by the Word the third day of the Creation, and this was nothing else but the generall sublunary or lower waters.</p>
                        <p>This therefore was the estate of the world in the Creation, and in this very state doth continue hitherto, and will do till it be refined by the fiery Tryall.

                        <p>The true Mystery of Generation and Corruption (also a touch of Re-generation or Resurrection) is, afer the doctrine of holy Scripture, herein Expressed.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <div type="topic">
                        <p>AS we have plainly, though in few words, expressed unto you a dark privative Principle, namely that which seemed before all beginnings to be without form, and therefore mortifieth and depriveth of life, and is as it were out of all existence, in regard of our capacity; by reason that the active vivifying light doth not shine forth, but is hidden in the center. So also have we manifested unto you another Spirituall Principle, which is Light, now shining forth of Darkness, and this is that only which informeth, vivifieth and animateth all things with life. I told you that all was but one essentiall Unity: For the three Divine Person was but one and the same in essence, and therefore that Light was unto him as Darkness, and consequently that he was the beginning of all beginnings; that is to say, he is as well the principle of Privation and Corruption, as of Position and Generation, whereof the one is the Act unto life, namely the in-created Light; and the other is the passive of life or death, and that is the waters; forasmuch as they were derived out of Darkness, and therefore by reason of their Darkness they partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in their passion, as well of the privative, as of the positive principle; and for that reason the Actor in both extreames is God, which is Unity, who by the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of his vivifying Spirit from the creature causeth death and privation, and consequently leaveth nothing in it but the characters of corruption and ruine: Contrariwise by continuing his incorruptible Spirit in the creature, it remaineth by the presence thereof without corruption. Also after that God doth withdraw his Spirit from the creature, then the creature dieth; if he sendeth again his Spirit of life into the creature, it reviveth and riseth again. This was the reason in one sense of the Resurrection of our Saviour, who for that cause was termed <hi>Primaevus resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectionis à mortuis: The first that risse again from death unto eternall life.</hi> And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other sense it was the cause, that <hi>Elias</hi> raised from the dead the child of the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; and that the bones of <hi>Elizeus</hi> caused the murthered <hi>Amalikite</hi> to rise again; as also that Christ caused <hi>Lazarus</hi> to revive when he was dead, as shall be shewed hereafter. I will therefore express unto you out of Scriptures, first that God (to whom the act of privation is as familiar as that of position, if we only consider the watery or passive composition, forasmuch as it participateth of both extreames) is the only Actor as well unto death and corruption, as to life and generation. And then secondly, I will briefly prove unto you, the manner how the self-same Unity in essence operateth thus contrarily in the watry or bodily Subject of all things.</p>

Lo here the essentiall reason and centrall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Generation and Corruption, is exactly described and set forth by the Psalmise, namely, that by the presence and benigne action of the incorruptible Spirit of the Lord, life is continued; and contrariwise, by the absence, or departing, or by taking of it away from the creature, it dieth and corrupteth; for so long as the incorruptible Spirit of the Lord acteth and worketh in the creature, it is not possible it should die or corrupt; but when it departeth, death and corruption must needs follow: also when it abideth in the body, but resteth from his action, or, as it were, withdraweth his active beams from the circumference unto the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (which the Prophet tearmeth, <hi>The hiding of God's face</hi>) then is the creature troubled, which is as much to say, as it is sick; but if it be totally taken away, then the creature is forced for want of it to expire and die. To conclude, if it return and shineth forth again unto the creature, then it reviveth again, as it did unto <hi>Lazar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

Whereby it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, how death is nothing else, but the absence of the essentiall form; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently it is made evident, that the vivificating form is immediately from God, and not that imaginary one which the Peripateticks have groped after; and I prove it evidently out of these places, though the precedent Text doth expresse it plainly enough,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note> 
                           <hi>Non permanebit</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>Spiritus meus in homine in aeternum quia caro est, eruntque Dies ejus centum viginti annorum: My Spirit shall not remain perpetually in man, because he is flesh, and his daies shall be a hundred years and twenty</hi>: Whereby is argued, that it is the Spirit of God which maketh man to live, and that by the absence thereof death must needs ensue. But because the curious will scarce approve of this translation of <hi>Jerom,</hi> saying, that the nature of the Hebrew Text is otherwise taken, I will maintain and confirm it by the like, and of the same condition in <hi>Job,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Job. 24.3.</note>

                              </gap>, all flesh would fail and die, and man also together with him would return unto ashes.</hi> So that we see, it is the Spirit of God which giveth life, not onely unto man, but also to every other creature: And that it is meant by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57108:42"/>
the reall vivifying Spirit of God, which giveth life unto man expresly, we have it confirmed thus by <hi>Job</hi> in another place.<note place="margin">Job. 33.4.</note> 
                           <hi>Spiritus Dei</hi> (saith <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>fecit me &amp; inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Omnipotentis vivificavit me; The Spirit of God made me, and the inspiration of the Almighty hath vivified me, or given me life.</hi> And therefore it followeth, that if the presence of this Spirit doth cause generation, life, and preservation, of necessity the absence of it must cause corruption, death, and destruction; for when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord is removed from the bodily masse of the creature, it leaveth it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and, as it were, another chaos, or <hi>terra inanis &amp; vacua,</hi> being that it is destitute of the Spirit of life, which did make it to act and exist in its specifick nature. And forasmuch as this incorruptible Spirit doth preserve the corporeall masse from corruption, by his incorruptible vertue and power, it followeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that when the Spirit is departed, or absolutely contracted in it self, without any externall act, the masse must of necessity forthwith die, and return unto a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative nothing.</p>
                        <p>Now the difference between the resurrection from death, or rather deadly sleep, unto a temporall life, (for the words of Christ were touching <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that he was not dead but slept) and that which is an eternall life, is this; for as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that hindereth death more, than the presence of the incorruptible Spirit, so also is there nothing which hindereth the perpetuity of living more, then a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible body, or a body subject unto death or corruption; and therefore that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy must die, that it may put off corruption, and endue incorruption, namely, by purification and separation of the corruptible additaments,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.36.</note> which is effected by a loosning of the tie of the alterable elements, and a freeing of the spirituall part of the corporall composition from its long captivity, that it may become pure and clean; which being done, then by the union of the incorruptible Spirit with it, all will be made spirituall; so that according unto the doctrine of St. <hi>Paul, That which is sowed,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.37.38.39.</note> 
                           <hi>will not be quickened except it die. And that which thou sowest is not the body that shall be, but God giveth it a body at his pleasure. And therefore as the body is sown in corruption, so it riseth in incorruption; as it is sown a naturall or elementary body, so it is raised a heavenly and spirituall body.</hi> So that the body must die, that it may put off corruption, that is, the corruptible portion of the impure element, that it being made spirituall, may abide with the Spirit of life for evermore. For this reason he affirmeth,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.50.</note> that <hi>flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> because in their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary nature they are subject unto corruption, and therefore cannot inherit the land of incorruption; but it is the pure spirit of the blood and flesh which rise (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have deposed their grosse tabernacle) unto incorruption, being animated by the incorruptible Spirit of the Lord, which onely causeth a temporall life in the naturall or compacted elementary masse, and an eternall one unto the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and refined body, which is contrary in condition unto the naturall body, as the Apostle doth justifie;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.44.</note> for by purification, it is changed from an elementary bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy unto a heavenly and spirituall one. Do we not see after the same example, how the very grain of wheat is so exalted in vertue, after it hath endured corruption, and hath been freed from the grosse elementary tie, that it would mount and soar upward towards the heaven, were it not that the spirit so set at liberty is detained by the elementary stuffe, which hinders it in its ascent; and yet neverthelesse it is so dignified after its corruption, that its vertue is augmented by many degrees, as it appeareth in the abundant multiplication which its dilated spirit doth produce, through the abundance of that incorruptible spirit which it endueth.</p>
                        <p>As touching the other resurrection, which is unto a temporall life, it is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the body is not corrupted, neither is there a loosning of elementary liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by dissolution, whereby the spirituall body may be purified, and clean se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from, and have no commerce with, the elementary dreggs, which do issue out of the lower waters; so that the occult spirituall body, cannot be at liberty to embrace the spirit of life with eternall tyes. Of this kind of resurrection was that which Christ effected on the widow's son, which was carried to be buried, when he said,<note place="margin">Luke. 7.14.</note> 
                           <hi>Young man, I say to thee, Arise; and he that was dead sat up.</hi> Also he caused resurrection in the like manner, to the dead daughter of one of the Rulers of the Synagogues, crying and saying, <hi>Maid, arise; and her spirit came again, and she rose up straight-way.</hi> Unto such a temporall life also, <hi>Lazarus</hi> was raised up. Again, by the prayer of <hi>Elijah,</hi> the widow's son was raised again: for the Text saith, that <hi>at the voice of Elijah,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Kings. 17.22.</note> 
                           <hi>the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.</hi> Whereby we ought to note two things, first, that these bodies were not wholly corrupted,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57108:42"/>
I mean the Elements of the composition, were not devided by resolution, and therefore though the Spirit returned into them, yet it brought their bodies but to a temporall life. And although it might be alledged, that Christ's body was not corrupted, and yet it had Resurrection from death unto eternall life. I answer, that the Text saith, that <hi>he would not suffer his Holy one to see corruption,</hi> and by that reason he had Resurrection the third day after he died,<note place="margin">Psal. 16.10.</note> being that his body was without sin, and therefore void of corruption. But I leave this mysticall doctrine to the research of the learned Theosophists. Secondly, we are to note that it is the presence of the vivifying Spirit of God, which causeth Generation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the death. And again, it is the absence thereof which induceth death and corruption: For the Scriptures say, that it was the soul of the child which came again into the child, to make it alive again. And the other Text saith, <hi>her spirit came again, and she revived.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Job 24.3. Psal. 104.29.</note> And therefore <hi>Job</hi> said, in the place above mentioned: <hi>If God should draw his Spirit or Spiracle of life from the creature, all flesh would expire.</hi> And <hi>David: If thou takest away their breath, they die: If thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they revive or are re-created.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now if we shall compare this our principle of Generation and Corruption, with that of the Peripateticks, we shall find as great a confusion in the one, as there is a plain explication of the other: for they define Generation, to be <hi>mutatio mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae à forma substantiali pristina in aliam formam substantialem: A change or mutation of matter from its wonted substantiall form into another form.</hi> Also they will have Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to be,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Velcur. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 13 <hi>Com.

                           <hi>mutatio &amp; amissio formae substantialis quae prius inerat materiae, sed nunc non inest eidem: The mutation or loss of a substantiall form which was first in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but now hath forsaken it.</hi> Thus you see how they nominate a substantiall form but what it is, and how it commeth into the body to cause Generation, or after what manner it departeth from it again, to cause death and corruption they relate not, and therefore we have <hi>ignotum per ignotius</hi>: when in verity it is the Spirit of God, which informeth and vivifieth all things, causing by its presence as well Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration (which <hi>Aristotle</hi> observed) and Resurrection (which he never knew or could discern by his worldly Philosophy,) as corruption, privation, and death, by its absence. So that in this change or passage of the creature from one estate unto another, we shall find that as it was made, and all things else out of one dark and deformed potentiall principle, by the shining forth of actuall Light, which informed, and by information created all things of Nothing, making them to live and exist, so also by the absence of that all-informing Light, each thing becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth dark, dead, and destitute of their essentiall form, untill a new Light do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest it self after a manner, which doth alienate the watery Subject from the form and shape it had at the first. So the body or carkasse of a dead man, is in the state of a deformed chaos, in regard it hath lost its wonted human substantiall form or act; no otherwise then if the Lord did take away his Spirit from the world, all things would return again to Nothing, or a deformed chaos or dark abysse, as it was at first: But when the effectuall act of a new form doth break forth out of the dead carcasse, causing the whole Mass thereof to become verminous, or full of worms, then may we say that the Corruption of the one is the Generation of the other, which evermore holdeth good, when the Elementary stuff is still present. So that Privation is the mean between them both, and as it were a vacuity, a <hi>Nih<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Now therefore that the progression or ranks of the worlds Creation, and his simple Members is shewed you, which consisteth of four ranks, in which estate the world must (as I said) indure till it be refined with fire, I will make my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression from these simple members of the world's existence, and proceed unto the order of degrees in composition, which have their beginning and foundation from them, namely from the first degree or rank in Generation or Composition, unto the Complement thereof. And as between the beginning of mixtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the perfection thereof, there must intercede a <hi>medium</hi> or mean, which must be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectè mixtum,</hi> or an imperfect mixtion: so betwixt a simple Element and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect body, an imperfect composition must needs intercede, namely such a one as is that of a Meteorologick nature. As for example, in the generation of a man, the beginning, which is founded on the catholick watery Element, and taketh his place in the first rank, is Sperm; for it is a watery or fluid Substance, but little altered: and as in the water the whole Fabrick of the world, and seeds of all things was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57108:43"/>
complicitly conteined, and yet nothing did appear externally but water. So in the seed or Sperm, though nothing do appear in the first degree explicitly but Sperm, yet the whole man, namely the bones, flesh, blood, sinews, and such like, are complicitly conteined, and will by degrees appear out explicitly, namely in the sixt rank: for it will be altered from humour to solidity, with a certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the three principall Members: in the seventh, to an Embrionall shape: and in the eighth which will make up a cube unto the materiall root 2. or the Square 4. (which is characterized in the catholick Element by the impressions of the four winds) into a perfect creature. In like manner, in the great world we see that the simple Element, namely the generall aire, appeareth externally plain simplicity, and an invisible Nothing explicitly, and yet it containeth complicitly, a clowd, water, or rain, Fire or Lightning, and a ponderous stone, with Salt and such like: which by degrees do explicitly appear through the vertue of the four Winds. So that a vapour possesseth the first rank, the cloud the sixt, the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and clowd the seventh, and the earthly Stone argueth an exact rotation of all the foure ventous forms into one mixtion, which represents the eighth's place in Composition or Generation. But when the man cometh to Corruption, then his parts proceed in resolution backwards, namely from 8. to 7. from 7. to 6. and from 6. to 5. untill it return unto the point of the simple Spermatick Element from whence it began, and there it beginneth a new Generation in another form: For the all-acting nature is never idle. So also the Stone is resolved into water, and water into a vaporous clowd, and the clowd into aire from when<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>that can be no otherwise: again, we esteem that as well voluntary as fortuit, or happening by chance, which may be otherwise.</hi> Now there hath risen and sprung up a great dispute among the Ethnick Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, whether God operateth in this world voluntarily, or of necessity, or as it were by compulsion: the greater part therefore of them are flatly of an opinion, that God acteth in this world, as well in the generation and conservation of things, as corruption of them, by necessity, and not by any voluntary motion; whereby it must follow, that he was enforced to do or effect what he doth from all eternity, by some other nature, which was either coeternall with him, or pre-existent; or else that he was excited or pushed forward against his will, to effect this or that, by some creature which he did make. All which, how erroneous and extravagant it is from the rules and center of truth, I will in few words expresse unto you: For first of all, What (I beseech you) is of greater antiquity than God, being that he was before any thing? What is in Geometry before, or in measure lesse then a point? or which among all the numbers of Arithmetick is of so antient a standing as is the unity? Wherefore it must needs follow, that God is free and voluntary in his actions, being that he was of himself, and did exist without any respect had unto any other, either precedent or coeternall principle from all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and therefore was sufficient in himself, and of himself, to work and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by himself from all eternity.</p>
                     <p>But the principall reasons of the foresaid Ethnick opinion, are two-fold; first, because God doth act and operate by his proper essence, and not by any acquired ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; then, forasmuch as the effects in the world seem to be necessary, and hereupon they conclude, that they cannot come or proceed from any contingent, that is to say, fortuit or voluntary occasion of another. Unto the first, me-thinks they seem to argue against themselves; for as he acteth by his proper essence or substance, it is evident, that he is moved of his own accord, and consequently not by any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall compulsion, or internall necessity. Moreover, in the latitude of unity, there can be no compulsion or coaction, because that Unity cannot suffer. Again, it is not possible that he should be urged to work by any externall or alien efficient cause, because that he remaining primarily fixed, and stedfast in himself, and of himself, worketh as the originall fountain of all things by himself, emitting his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57108:44"/>
formall and vivifying beams of life at his pleasure, and with-drawing them again when and where he pleaseth. Unto the second I say, that necessary effects do no way include any necessity in the first efficient cause, because that secundary causes (which <hi>Plato</hi> and other wise-men called Hand-maids or She-slaves) do act at the command and inciting of him, which is the unity of all multitude, and therefore all in all, or by a necessary order; so that a necessity in worldly created things, dependeth upon the volunty and command of him who made them, the which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he accomplisheth and finisheth at his pleasure: And therefore we find this written by the wise-man,<note place="margin">Wisd. 16.22.</note> 
                        <hi>Ignem mitescit nè combureret, modò ignem ille facit ardere inter aquas, &amp;c. He maketh the fire mild and gentle, lest it should burn; and now again he maketh it to burn between the waters, yea, and in the clouds of hail and snow, without melting of them.</hi> Again, <hi>He maketh the fire to forget his destroying property, that the righteous may be nourished by it.</hi> It was also an evident argument, that God worketh not of necessity in or upon this creature of fire, when the three servants of the living Lord were untouched by the fire of the Chaldean furnace, although it was heated three times. This also is confirmed by that History, where it is said, that in the time of <hi>Joshua</hi> the Sun stood still for a whole daies space; as also that in the daies of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the Sun was made to go backward fifteen degrees, in the Horologe or Diall, without any evident reason in nature. Moreover it is proved and verified in that wonderful Eclipse of the Sun, which happened at the death and passion of our Saviour, wherein the Sun of heaven was totally obscured, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so chanced beyond the expectation or capacity of the Astrologians &amp; Naturalists of this world; forasmuch as at the instant of that Eclipse or passion of the Sun, the Moon was neither in the head or tail of the Dragon, as <hi>Firmicus,</hi> that great artist in Astronomy, doth witnesse; and therefore it was effected against the common course of nature: all which events could never have fallen out, if God had acted of necessity in this world. It followeth therefore plainly, that God doth operate in this world of his own free will, not of necessity, to effect the ordinary or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall course of things, according to the lawes and necessities of nature, all which also he effecteth voluntarily, and of his own free-will, namely, as well for their creation and preservation, as finall corruption.</p>
                     <p>But come hither and hearken, O ye vain Philosophers, who would have God, which is the actor and ordinator of all things, to be bound up by the lawes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity; What honour and glory can any man justly attribute to God, for his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom justice, and clemency, if he were constrained of necessity, not onely to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate all things after this or that manner, but also to nourish and sustain them, and afterward to bring them to corruption? What thanks, or service, or adoration should we owe him, if what he did for us were of necessity? Wherefore, O <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> is it according unto thine assertion, that we should offer sacrifice unto the roots of nature? or what availed it for us mortall men, to pray and pour forth our supplications unto God, (the which duty neverthelesse <hi>Plato, Porphyry, Jambl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or wherefore did <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (the which, by the testimony of the Oracle, were esteemed the most sage persons of their time) use accustomarily to pour out their prayers unto God, if God were onely constrained to act and operate whatsoever he did in the world?

                        <hi>That God was onely to be called upon, and prayed unto,</hi> if there were any necessity in God to act in the generation and conservation of things? Yea verily, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to be demonstrated by this which is already said, that God, by the means of prayer, is accustomarily inclined to misericord and pitty, and that it is in his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to deal either in severity or clemency with the world, and the creatures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and consequently that he is not urged of necessity, to operate or bring forth effects, as certain vain Ethnick Philosophers have averred; amongst the which, I must nominate a remarkable personage, and a follower of <hi>Aristotles</hi> doctrine, namely, <hi>Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I am of another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: For I say, that Nature cannot do some things, and that God doth not attempt those things at all, but doth elect and make choice of the best of such things as he is able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Now since that it would be better, that the hair in the eie-brows should be alwaies equall in magnitude and numbers I affirm that it is not he that would have it so, and they were forthwith made, neither could he do it; and I say, that if he would a thousand times have them so, yet would they never be such, if they had been produced out of the soft skin.</hi> Lo how Atheistically he speaketh, and how he would restrain the Omnipotency of God, and limit his actions with the main clog of necessity, yea, and impotency in Power!</p>
                     <p>But there are certain other Philosophers, which do behave themselves more modestly in the beforesaid doubt. For <hi>Avicenna</hi> affirmeth, that these actions are neither of necessity, nor violent, but do consist in a mediocrity betwixt them both, and thereupon he concludeth, that it is in the volunty or will of the Agent. In the which resolution he seemeth not much to vary from Scriptures, which say, <hi>Deus castigavit nos propter iniquitates nostras,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tob. 13.5.</note> 
                        <hi>ipse salvabit nos propter misericordiam suam. God hath chastised us for our iniquities, he will save us for his mercy's sake.</hi> By which, this elected vessell doth intimate, that there is a free volunty in God to punish and to have mercy. But this is expressed in plain words, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Deus juxta voluntatem suam facit, tam in coeli virtutibus, quam in habitatoribus ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae: God operateth according to his Will,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>as well with the vertues of heaven, as with the Inhabitants of the earth.</hi> In which words, the Prophet doth evidently show, that every operation in this world is effected by the Will, and in or by the Word or Spirit of the Almighty, and therefore not of Necessity, as <hi>Aristotle, Galen,</hi> and many other of the Ethnick Philosophers have averred, to the derogation from God, and blemishing of his Omnipotency. But that there is an undoubted ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity in the Organicall causes, and in the effects which issue from God's Acts in them, it appeareth most evidently: Wherefore the Prophet <hi>Baruch</hi> saith, <hi>Deo obediunt per omnia, Sol, Luna, Sydera, Fulgur, Ventus, Nubes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Sun, Moon, Starrs, Lightnings, Winds, Clouds,</hi> &amp;c. do obey the Will and Command of God, that is, they are incited by his Word, and of necessity provoked to effect his pleasure: It followeth not therefore, that he that commandeth, must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to do or act in that imperious manner, being that he doth it as a first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, who hath not any other actor before it, or co-eternall with it, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doth operate of a free will, which is radically grounded in himself. And hereupon the Apostle:<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note>

                     <p>AFter that the Author had expressed the Originall nature of the two essentiall properties, namely of Heat and Cold, and had proved the main effects thereof to be Rarefaction and Condensation, whereby the Heavens and Elements were framed: He proceedeth now in this Book unto the mystery of Meteorologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call impressions, being the first degree of Composition, shewing that their Fabrick is the act of the Divine Spirit, effected in the catholick Element of the world's lower region, and consequently do not proceed from such accidentall and externall grounds or beginnings, as the Peripateticks do fasly surmise. For this reason therefore he hath compared the Meteorologicall doctrine of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> with that of the holy Scripture. And finally by producing the Pagan Philosophy touching these aiery impressions unto the Lidian tryall, or touch-stone of Truth, he findeth them to prove false spurious metal, yea and meer dross, in respect of the golden Truth.</p>

                        <p>Herein you shall find, in few words, a Repetition of the precedent Discourse: Also an Exposition upon the word <hi>Meteoron</hi> or Meteor. And lastly the Method, which the Author intendeth to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in this Book, is expressed.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my precedent discourse, I have briefly pointed at, first the Principles of things, namely the Root of every thing that was, <hi>viz.</hi> the Dark or potentiall unity, from which sprung forth the Light or actuall unity. And I told you, that both of them were but one thing in essence, forasmuch as Light was unto the eternall unity all one with darkness, though unto our weak capacities they are opposite in property. Then I signified, that out of the first obscure unity, by his other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest property waters did appeare, arguing thereby that of or from this unity, by this unity, and in this unity, are all things. After that, I shewed how waters were the materiall or passive Principle of all things, as the illuminating and formall Spirit, was the actuall and informing beginning of every being; both which issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (as I said before) out of one Root, which for that cause is rightly said to be all in all. Then I expressed unto you how that Cold was an essentiall adherent unto privative rest, and the stout of-spring and Champion unto darkness. As contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise, Heat was the immediate issue and companion, unto essentiall action or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the inseparable Champion or Assistant of Light. And then I told you how Humidity and Siccity, had their Originall from the mutuall presence or absence of the foresaid two active vertues or essentiall properties, Cold and Heat. Lastly, I declared unto you the reason and manner of Condensation and Rarefaction, and that the main matter or Subject thereof, was the waters, but the catholick Actor was and is the Word or Spirit of God, who acteth first in his Angelicall Organs, by the Starrs, and especially the Sun in Heaven above, and winds beneath, upon the generall sublunary Waters or Elements, according unto his volunty, altering of it after a four-fold manner, through the formall properties of the four Winds, and that either by Condensation or Subtiliation, into divers shapes and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now in this Book I will open unto you, after a true and infallible manner, (forasmuch as it shall in all points agree with the contents of the holy History:) how the blessed Word or sacred Spirit of the Lord doth by Condensation and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction produce and bring forth, in this our catholick sublunary Element, all Meteorologicall bodies. But before I enter into this my discourse, it is fit for me to tell you what the Antients do mean by this word <hi>Meteor.</hi> Those Apparitions
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57108:45"/>
which are seen in the aire, are by the Greeks called <hi>Meteora,</hi> not in regard of their naturall essences, but by reason of their sublimity in position. Others tearm them more naturally, Impressions; forasmuch as they are shaped and imprinted above in the catholick element, called Air.</p>
                     <p>But in respect of their essentiall consistence, they are properly called <hi>Corpora im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectè mixta aut composita, Bodies that are imperfectly mixed or compounded</hi>; and that either because of their unexpected generation, being that they are procreated and appear suddainly, and at a short warning, or else because their composition ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not to be according unto the mutation or change of substance, or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of quality; or else in regard they are not so exactly composed, as other anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bodies which are perfectly mixed. Or lastly, these impressions are so called, forasmuch as they have not attained unto any perfect form; neither seems there to be in this kind of composition any great alteration of parts; seeing that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the element so altered, are confused with one another. Howsoever, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that such names are assigned unto this kind of impression, after the fancy or conceit of this or that Philosopher, when in verity they are <hi>magnalia Dei</hi>; a mysticall body, I say, framed and fashioned by the finger of God, out of the bowels of the catholick sublunary element, to effect his will upon the earth, either to judgment or mercy, as shall be more at large expressed hereafter. So that in this sense they may rightly be tearmed, the characters or signes of Gods benignity and misericord, or vengeance and severity upon the earth. My purpose therefore in this <hi>Meteorologicall</hi> relation, is, to direct you into the path of true wisdom, for the better scanning and decyphring-out of so great a mystery, as is the meteorologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call act of the Spirit of God, and to lead you by that means out of the mire and puddle of Ethnick or pagan Philosophy, in which we Christians, even unto our immortall shame, do stick fast, and like brutish swine do willingly wallow. The which that I may the better effect, I will compare the absurdities of the false Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticall Philosophy, with the infallible verity of the holy Text, that thereby each Christian, pondering in the ballance of justice, the contradiction which shall be expressed between the one and the other, may open his intellectual eyes, and follow sincerely that which is good, and forsake the bad, betaking himself unto the truth, and flying from that which is prestigious and false, and may by that means at the last discern with open eyes, that main difference which is between the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Philosophy of this world, which in verity (for the Spirit of God hath pronounced it so) is meer foolishnesse, and that of God, which is the reall and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall truth. Thus therefore you may discern, and that in few words, the manner or order of my method in this Book, not determining with my self to be over-te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious unto you in it, but to finish briefly that <hi>Meteorologicall</hi> wisdom, which in regard of its own worth, deserveth to be enrolled in the everlasting monument of a far greater volume; and to be polished or burnished over with the lustre of a more elegant style, and refined manner of speech.</p>

                        <p>In this Chapter the true mystery of the Winds is discovered and set down, according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the intention of the divine Spirit's testimony; and withall, the false and presti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious spirit <hi>of Aristotle,</hi> and his Peripateticall adherents, touching that subject, is unmasked and made manifest.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THat I may the better expresse that difference, which is between the false wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and philosophy of this world, and that which, because it is of God, must be true indeed, nay, verity and truth it self, my minde and purpose is in the first place, to set down the opinion of the Peripateticall faction, and then afterward to compare and examine it with the touchstone of the divine Word or Scripture, thereby to make a tryall, whether it be right and sound or not; that is, whether it will bear water, or shrinck in the wetting. Now because (as I said) the four cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and collaterall winds of the heavens, with their angelicall Presidents, are the actors in the transformation of the catholick Mercuriall element, or Protean sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary waters, from one shape into another, I think it most necessary to begin this my story or discourse with the profound mystery of the winds in generall, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they are noted to be the principles of all the other Meteors. And first I
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57108:46"/>
will expresse what the pagan Peripateticks, and their Christian followers, have and do determine concerning them.</p>
                     <p>The Peripateticall Philosophers are of opinion, that the wind is a hot and dry exhalation, being difficultly enflamed, which ariseth out of the earth, and soareth up unto the middle region of the aire, from whence it being forthwith repelled downwards, by reason of the coldnesse of that region; and again it re-indeavouring upwards, doth partly in regard of its levity, and partly by other ascending exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which it meeteth in his violent and coacted descent; move laterally in the lower region of the aire, the which aire it doth ventilate and agitate, lest that for want of motion or stirring, it should putrifie. This is the sum of their opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the generation of the winds. I will therefore insist upon this Peripateti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or Aristotelian definition, or rather description of the winds.</p>
                     <p>First, because that the spurious Christian Philosophers, as if they were incited thereunto by a kind of unbridled madnesse, do not stick to defend, and by their best endeavours uphold this his opinion, as well in their publick Schools, and private negotiations or studies, as by their writings; and that with such an assured obstinacy, as if it had been divinely published unto worldlings, or uttered and pronounced by the sacred Oracle of truth it self.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, because the place wherein this imaginary exhalation is said to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered, and from whence it is derived, is by it esteemed to be the earth; and the seat unto which it coveteth to ascend, is (according unto their doctrin) the middle region of the aire, into the which, by reason of the cold temper thereof, it is not permitted to enter or penetrate, but the <hi>medium</hi> or mean (forsooth) in the which it moveth naturally upward, and by compulsion, or against nature, downwards; and lastly, by justling or strugling together, of other ascending exhalations, and the forcible descending fumes laterally, that is to say, towards the right or left hand, is the lower region of the aire.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, for that they seem to averr, as it appeareth by this definition, that the agent, mover, or efficient causer of this exhalation, as well downwards as lateral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is double or two-fold, namely, the cold of the middle region of the aire, which forceth and presseth downward towards the earth, that scarce imaginable fume, and the other is the troop of other ascending exhalations, or subtle smoaks, which successivly do rise out of the earth, which in their motion upwards, meeting with that fume which is forced to descend, do strive, and, as it were, wrestle with it, and consequently by that means do make a noise in the aire, which is called the Wind.</p>
                     <p>And this is the Peripateticall Philosopher's windy fiction, which in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, after a due examination, will prove to be but a bubble, or vain puff of wind; that is to say, meerly words, without any substance. Now the finall end or cause why their nature hath ordained these windy motions in the aire, is, (as their defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition doth testifie) that by this manner of ventilation, the aire may be preserved, cleared, and purged from all putrefaction, and corrupt disposition. But whosoever will give credit unto this Ethnick definition, especially if he be a true lover of wisdom, I counsell him, first, to examine every particular member of it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a diligent enquiry therein, let him see and discern, whether they agree with the lawes of true reason and wisdom.</p>
                     <p>In the first rank and order therefore, let us mark or observe, whether in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer member of his description, there be any probability of verity to be found: By it we are told and taught, that the materiall substance of the winde is a hot and dry exhalation, arising and surging out of the earth: But by holy Scripture (which all true Christians ought to credit before all things) we are taught, that the winde hath his originall or beginning from the Spirit or breath of <hi>IEHOVAH: A flatu narium tuorum</hi> (saith <hi>Moses</hi>) <hi>coacervatae sunt aquae,</hi>

And for this cause, St. <hi>Denis</hi> doth tearm the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57108:46"/>
                        <hi>Algamatha,</hi> that is to say, clear Mirrours, or looking-Glasses, which do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the splendour or light of God, and do represent his image. And therefore the Prophet, in the place above mentioned, doth describe both the hidden and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible winde, and that which is fiery, and doth manifestly appear in the form of lightning, to be an angelicall spirit, animated by the divine fire, or bright emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God. All which being rightly considered, we must either confesse, that the Spirit of the nostrills or mouth of <hi>IEHOVA,</hi> is a hot and dry exhalation, subject unto preternaturall passions, and arising out of the earth, (which would appear too profanely uttered out of a Christian's mouth) or that this member of the Peripateticall definition is most false and erroneous. But this shall be discovered more plainly in my enquiry, and laying open of the other members.</p>
                     <p>The second member of this definition doth intimate unto us, that the place wherein that exhalation, which is the materiall cause of the winde, is ingendred, and from the which it is derived, is the earth; but the place or seat unto the which it tendeth (saith it) is the middle region of the aire; and the medium and space in which that moveth, as well upward and downward, as laterally, is the lower re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the aire. In the which assertion of this Ethnick Philosopher, I will make plain, and prove evidently, that there will be found divers grosse errours, and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable absurdities. But that we may the better effect our enquiry, and hunt after the truth of the businesse, that is to say, for the exacter examinations cause, it will be necessary for us, to divide this member or clause into three parts; in the first whereof we ought seriously to consider, whether the matter of the winds be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of the earth or no. In the second, if that substance do onely soar up, and make his way unto the concave superficies of the middle region of the aire one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In the third, whether the place in which the wind moveth, be onely the lower region of the aire. To the former question or doubt we say, That either the sacred Bible (which is the fountain of truth) is false, or this particle of the second mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber must be most erroneous;<note place="margin">John 3.8.</note> for, saith St. <hi>John, Spiritus ubi vult spirat, &amp; vocem ejus audis, sed nescis unde veniat, aut quò vadat: The wind or spirit bloweth where it will, and thou hearest his voice, but thou knowest not from whence it commeth, or whither it goeth.</hi> Which being rightly pondered by wise-men, they must conclude, that either <hi>Aristotle</hi> saw further into the mysteries of God and nature, than the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, who was a true and sincere Christian Philosopher and Theosopher, and then St. <hi>John</hi> must be proved a lyar in his doctrine, which were a great impiety in any Christian to imagine; or else the assertion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> must clearly be found false, and in all things contradictory unto the truth. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that the matter of the winde doth move from the earth, and ascendeth into the middle region of the aire, and from thence is repelled downward. But St. <hi>John</hi> saith, that the winde moveth not constrainedly, that is to say, by coaction, nor any accidentall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, but voluntarily, and according unto its own pleasure and appetite; for his words are, <hi>Spiritus spirat ubi vult, It bloweth where it will</hi>; and that although the voice and noise of it be familiar unto the ears, yet neverthelesse it is not known from whence it commeth, or whither it will. This doctrine of the Evangelist, which so mainly differeth from that of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> is maintained out of divers places of holy Writ: for the royall Psalmist, with the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> saith, <hi>Depromit ventos è the sauris suis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 135.7. Jerem. 51.15.</note> 
                        <hi>He draweth forth the winds out of his treasuries.</hi> But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures prove, that the earth is not the seat or place of Gods treasure, where it spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thus, <hi>Aperiet tibi IEHOVAH thesaurum suum optimum, coelos, dando pluviam terrae suo tempore:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 28.32.</note> 
                        <hi>IEHOVA will open unto thee his best treasure, the heavens, giving rain unto the earth in his due time.</hi> He doth not say the earth, but the heavens; so that between these two there is a great difference, as between night and day. Wherefore it is evident, that the heaven or catholick element of air, is the secret cabinet of these <hi>meteorologica Dei magnalia,</hi> or meteorologick wonders. Hereupon it is said in another place, <hi>Januas coelorum aperuit pluens Manna, &amp;c. He opened the gates of heaven,</hi>

                        <hi>raining down Manna.</hi> Again, it is so hard a thing for a mortall man, that is not illuminated with the spirit of wisdom, to find out or discover this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane treasury of God, that JEHOVAH himself speaketh unto <hi>Job,</hi> though he were a just man, and one that feated God, much more he pointeth at the wise-man or Philosopher of this world, who never was acquainted with the divine Word, in this manner,<note place="margin">Job. 38.22.</note>

But to proceed unto the doubt, which is, Whether according unto <hi>Aristotles</hi> intention, the originall matter of the wind be of the earth, and his first motion from the earth into heaven? A man more learned and wise by far in the mysteries of nature, than <hi>Aristotle</hi> ever was,<note place="margin">Eccl. 11.5.</note> answereth in this manner, <hi>Venti viam</hi> (saith he) <hi>ignorat homo, ignorat homo opus ipsius Dei, qua via faciat haec omnia: Man knoweth not the way or path of the winds, man knoweth not the work of God, namely, by what means he effecteth these things.</hi> But <hi>Aristotle</hi> was a man, yea, and an Ethnick man, and therefore could so much the lesse judge rightly of such abstruse things, as are these; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore JEHOVAH seeming to deride the boldnesse of such a worldling, and as it were in reprehending of him,<note place="margin">Job 38.24.</note> speaketh in these words, <hi>Nosti nè ubinam sit via, in qua dividitur exhalatio quae spargit ventum super terram?

                           </gap>e</hi> seemeth impudently to answer God, and say, I know it well, for the way of this exhalation is from the earth upward, unto the middle region of the aire, where partly by an Antiperistasis caused of cold, driving it downward again, and partly by other exhalations, which are successivly ascending, the exhalation is compelled to move laterally upon the face of the earth, &amp;c. But I will shew the impossibility of this reason, by that which followeth immediately hereafter.</p>
                     <p>To the second and third part of this clause, I say, that the <hi>medium</hi> by the which the winds are carried or moved, is, by far, more vast and large, then that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> assignes unto it; for the winde doth not blow and act onely in the lower; but also in the middle, yea, and in the upper region of the aire. If therefore the winde do blow in the middle region of the aire, then will the vigour of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s definition be taken away, forasmuch as the efficacy thereof doth chiefly consist in this, namely, that such a hot and dry exhalation, as is the cause of the wind, is not permitted to penetrate the middle region of the aire, but is reverberated, precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and beaten down again, by the vertue of the middle region's cold, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth the heat of the sublimed exhalation. Now if there be any wind in the middle region of the aire, this cause of the winde will be taken away, forasmuch as then the exhalation will not be repelled downwards into the lower region, where it should meet other ascending exhalations to make a noise, and to be dispersed laterally on the earth; for the exhalation which causeth a wind in the middle region, will not be driven down by the cold, but is observed to blow, and to move the clouds and thunders in the middle of that sphear; yea, it is made manifest by daily experience, that as well the upper or higher clouds, which are white and yellow, and therefore more light and subtle, by reason of their fiery brightnesse, as the lower, which are grosser and more obscure, are driven and pushed by the winds, from any quarter of the world unto the opposite; for except the winds were also present in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they could never move as on the wings of the winds in that manner. Do we not also observe, that the south-wind bloweth from the southern horizon, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other from the next, which is northern, so that both winds have dominion in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the horizons, at all one and the same time, whereupon it often happeneth, that great and dark clouds, moving from each opposite quarter, by four of those contrary angelicall spirits, do meet in the point of each Horizon, and cause one masse or huge sea of clouds, serving as a Tabernacle unto the great spirit of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which worketh or causeth these things: whereupon there followeth great lightnings and thunders, by the concourse of opposite angelicall natures, being the messengers, ministers, and voice of the Almighty, which never could have

been effected, unless the winds by the will of the Almighty, had moved impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously the one against the other in the middle-region of the aire. And this we have also confirmed out of Scripture, where it is said: <hi>Ascendit fumus e naribus IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAE, carbones accensi sunt ab eo, inclinavit coelos, &amp; descendit, &amp; caligo sub pedibus ejus,</hi>

                        <hi>&amp; ascendit super Cherubin, &amp; volavit &amp; lapsus est super pennas venti, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit tenebras in circuitu suo latibulum, cribrans aquas de nubibus coelorum; prae fulgore in conspectu ejus nubes succensae sunt, tonabat de coelo Dominus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Smoak ascended out of the nostrils of IEHOVA, coales are kindled by him. He inclined or bowed down the heavens and descended, and darkness was under his feet, and he ascended upon the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubin, and did flie, and glide upon the wings of the wind. He put the darknesse round about him, to serve for to hide him, sisting out waters from the clouds of heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face; for at his presence the clouds were set on fire, and the Lord did thunder from heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Out of which speech we gather, that not only the Clouds, and Thunder, and Lightnings, are moved by the windy ministers or Angels of the Lord: but also that Divinity it self, being compassed about with dark clowds in the middle region of the aire, is carried upon the airy Cherubin, and useth the wings of the winds as organs to move on: Whereby each wise man may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the worldly wisdome or Peripateticall Philosophy is plain foolishness: being that it would falsly perswade the world, that such essentiall Acts, as are the Angelicall winds, (whose inward essence is the bright Spirit of the Lord) are caused accidentally, and are moved and stirred up by externall violence: when by the doctrine of the true wisdome, it is evident that they are indued with most essentiall internall Agents, and therefore do move where and when they list, according unto that before-mentioned of St. <hi>John</hi>: For (saith he) <hi>Spiritus spirat ubi vult: The Spirit bloweth where it lists.</hi> Which being so, as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that the wind hath <hi>actum, formam, &amp; principium internum: An essentiall and inward act, form, and Principle, at the motion whereof it is moved or caused which way the invard mover pleaseth,</hi> and therefore the Text saith, <hi>Spirat ubi vult: It bloweth where it will,</hi> and consequently it is indued with a volunty or will: whereby each man may see how extravagant from the Truth is the Peripateticks reason touching this point, who admit no essentiall and internall form unto the Winds, but make it a thing meerly accidentall: As for example, the Starrs by their heat stir or draw up a smoak out of the Earth, this smoak soring on high, is by the coldness of the place pushed down again, then by other ascending fumes it is forced to move side-long. I beseech you (that are wise and unpartiall) teach me which of all these externall accidents in the procreation of the winds, can be esteemed for that internall or essentiall principle, which can cause a volunty or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motion in the winds, or can produce any Angelicall act in the aire? For the Text saith, <hi>Spiritus spirat ubi vult.</hi> If there be no such essentiall volunty, or internall or centrall agent to be found or really imagined in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s fiction or fained wind; then let his breath that teacheth unto Christians such falshood, be as vainly esteemed, as his Doctrine is prestigious in it self.

                     <p>But I will proceed a little further in this my inquiry. <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticall Disciples aver, that the stormy and tempestuous wind, called <hi>Ecnephia,</hi> as also the Whirl-wind, are certain repentine or suddain winds, which are forcibly
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57108:48"/>
expelled out of the clowds, and yet forsooth he will not admit, that a hot and dry exhalation can penetrate into the middle region, by reason of the coldness thereof: but that we may dive a little deeper into the abysse of his absurdities, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that the cause of all fiery Meteors and Comets, is a hot and dry exhalation, which is terrestiall, crasse, fat, and unctuous, and therefore apt to be inflamed or set on fire: now he assigneth the place of Generation of comets, to be the higher region of the aire, and yet he denieth passage unto the exhalation, which causeth the winds, into the middle region, which is not inflamable, but thin and light. Can any man be so ignorant in naturall effects, as not to judge and imagine that cold will more suddainly resist, and withstand that which is inflamable and of an actuall fiery nature, as is the exhalation, which causeth the Comets, then that which is neither actually inflamable or fiery of it self, namely the fumes, which is said to be the Original of the winds? Again, it appeareth by his description of Comets, that their materiall substance is heavier, more terrestiall, crass, thick or compacted, then that of the winds, and therefore it must needs be less apt to ascend and penetrate (for as much as all ponderous things, by a naturall inclination, tend downward); then that of the winds, which is more light, subtill and thin, and consequently more apt to clime upward: wherefore it were impossible that the grosser fumes, which cause the Comets should ascend and penetrate into the upper region, as well by reason of their inflamable heat, as compact and ponderous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet the fumes of the winds, whose heat is not actually inflamable but light and penetrative, by reason of their subtility, should be debarred from pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing higher.</p>
                     <p>But I come unto the examination of the third member, and although I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spoken somewhat concerning it, yet it is fit, that touching this point I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my mind a little more at large in this place, because it is most pertinent unto our detection of this worldly wisdome's folly and errour. He describeth therefore in this member a double act of the wind, both which he but maketh accidents, as if a man should say, that they do not move from an internall and essentiall principle, but rather by externall accidents, namely by the heat of the Sun or Starrs, by the cold of the middle region of the aire, and the justling or encounter of other ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fumes: whereby he concludeth, that it moveth the aire allaterally and by consequence it happeneth by chance, and through externall means. What a glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and golden lie is this, much like one of those fabulous figments of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Poets: a thing, I say, which maketh a faire shew, but is, in verity, without substance: For by this assertion he maketh the winds nothing else but <hi>quid per ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens,</hi> when contrarily the mouth of Truth flatly contradicteth such a falshood, affirming that the wind proceedeth primordially, from the Divine Spirit or breath of God: yea, and it is termed by it an Angell, which is dilated and sent forth every where to effect the will of him that animateth it. <hi>Qui facit Angelos ventos</hi>: saith <hi>David,</hi>

Prince of our Philosophers will not blush (forsooth) to say, that the winde is a some-thing meerly accidentall, and that it hath his motion onely from externall principles, and not from that centrall and internall agent, which is the actor and operator of, and in all things, and consequently it could not blow or breathe where it listeth, nor yet to hear the voice of the Lord, when it was commanded to come from the four winds. He, according unto his fancy, saith, that this his fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is extracted out of the earth, when Scriptures say, that it is the most lively and agil creature of God, which he bringeth out of the heavens, (that are his treasure-house) for in this, both the Prophets, <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> do consent. But in this member of his definition, he concludeth, that the laterall motion of the winde is caused through that resistance and impediment, which is made by such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations as ascend. O poor argument of so mighty a Philosopher! as if such a ventall motion as that is, from the north unto the south, and so forth, could be so certain and direct in his course, being guided by so uncertain an agent, as is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall striving and contention made between ascending and descending fumes?</p>
                     <p>I beseech you tell me (my quaint Peripateticks) what manner of exhalation did rise out of the earth, and shoulder or shove and resist one another, in that emission of Spirit, which happened when the Prophet said, <hi>A quatuor ventis adveni, Spiritus, Come from the four winds,</hi>

                        <hi>O spirit,</hi> me-thinks that I see the Christian pages or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> to be clean mute, and destitute of tongues to answer; and if they should say, that it was a miraculous winde, and not a naturall, I answer, that I know no more efficient causes in nature, or out of nature, but onely one; and therefore it is said in the production of Meteors, namely, in the common course of this world nature, God bloweth from the north. God produceth by his breath frost, snow, ice. God thundereth from heaven. God melteth the thick clouds into rain. God sends lightning from his throne, and coles of fire out of his mouth. God maketh the dark clouds his hiding place. God commeth from the south in thunder. The voice of the Lord maketh the cedars of mount <hi>Libanus</hi> to stoop, and the hinds to miscarry of their young ones. God is a consuming fire. Who can stand or resist the cold of God? and so forth, in many places more, as well of the new as old Testament. And, to conclude, that God operateth all in all, and that he vivifieth all, &amp;c. But our Peripateticall Philosophers come with their School-tricks, and idle distinctions, and say, 'Tis true indeed, that he is <hi>causa effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens principalls</hi>; but there are many secondary and subalternate causes in nature, which do act of themselves. I say, Plain dealing is a jewell, and truth being one simple essence, hateth double dealing; let us imitate her in plainnesse and simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in understanding; which we cannot attain unto, unlesse we abstract our minds from the subtle multiplicity of worldly Philosophy, and vain fallacy, (of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth us to beware) for in multitude lurketh an infinity of errours, but in unity consisteth that unique verity, which is true wisdom. Why then should we distract mens thoughts from the simple sense of Scripture, by a multiplicity of distinctions, which seem to wrest it, like a nose of wax, a hundred waies. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures say, <hi>Of him, by him, and in him are all things. The holy spirit of wisdom filleth the world.</hi>

God is the Father of all, who is above all, and in all.</hi> And an infinite of other testimonies of Scriptures, which confirm the divine es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to be all in all, and to act all things universally without exception. And yet our Peripateticks will perswade us, that the creatures actions are divided from the act of God, so that they do and can act of themselves, through an active vertue given unto them by God, but not now of God; which assertion of theirs, were it true indeed, I will shew you how great an absurdity will follow, namely, that there must consequently be a division made in the divine essence, which axiom, true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity will never admit, for <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Creed doth teach us, that it is <hi>sancta &amp; individua Trinitas, the holy and undivided Trinity</hi>; and therefore what act the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath received, is not divided from the Giver, neither is there any such need, being the Giver of that formall vertue is by reason of that gift ever present, and not divided from the gift, and consequently acteth all in all, and that immediately. And for that cause it is rightly said by the divine Philosopher <hi>Hermes,</hi> to be the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57108:49"/>
center of all things, whose circumference is every where; so that it is in all, but not as a part of any thing, but as a composer of all parts, and a container of them. Wherefore let it suffice our Peripateticks, that the creatures are onely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicall causes, in which one onely catholick Spirit worketh and operateth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the variety of his property, which is annexed unto his will; and therefore he onely worketh in them, and by them, according unto his will, and that immediately and absolutely; and this is that which the Apostle intendeth, when he saith, <hi>Deus operatur omnia in omnibus, God worketh all in all.</hi> But to return unto my purpose. How deaf and surd had this invocation of the wise <hi>Solomon</hi> been, if the essence and life of the winds had been no other, then that which is set forth by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle: Evigila</hi> (saith he) <hi>Aquilo, &amp; veni Auster, &amp; perflahortum meum; Awake north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, and come thou, O south-wind, and blow upon my garden.</hi> To conclude, if the winds had been procreated after <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s invention or imagination, whence cometh it, that each winde is endued with a various and divers condition or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, insomuch as the one is hot and moist, the other cold and dry, the third hot and dry, and the last cold and moist? It were impossible that this difference and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety should happen, if all winds were framed and fashioned onely after one fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, if they did move laterally by compulsion, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> telleth the tale.</p>
                     <p>I come now unto the last clause or member of the Peripateticall definition, which doth touch the finall end or reason of the production or creation of the winds. His opinion is, that his nature doth produce this manner of ventilation, for the purging and purifying of the aire, and for the preservation thereof. But we are taught by experience, that this is not true, being that we with <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> do discern, that the southerly winds are contagious and pestiferous, forasmuch as they render the aire thick, and make it putrid and rotten by their malignant heat, and lax humidity: And this also we have confirmed by the sacred Text, <hi>Ne timeto</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>à lue seu daemonio vast ante in meridie,<note place="margin">Psal. 91.</note> Fear not the pestilence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tell us therefore essentially what is the winde, or how you define or describe it rightly, by the warrant of holy Writ? To this I answer, that it may be effected many waies, under one and the self-same essence: And first of all we may describe it, and that not impertinently, after this manner:</p>

The winde is an airy spirit, of a mean consistence, inspired and animated by the breath or inspiration of JEHOVA, the which he draweth forth of his treasury, to execute his will and pleasure, either by the way of malediction and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or of benediction and misericord.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Every particle of this definition is proved out of convenient places of holy Scriptures; and first, that his externall is aire, of a mean consistence, it is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, in that the words [aire, winde, and spirit] are expressed in many places of Scriptures, by all one Hebrew word, namely, by <hi>Ruach.</hi> Again, that his internall or moving soul, and centrall act, is the divine Spirit or inspiration, it is proved and confirmed by the places which are cited before: <hi>A flatu narium tuarum</hi> (saith <hi>Moses</hi>) <hi>coacervatae sunt aquae,</hi>

                     <p>Lastly, touching the use of the winds, or the finall cause why they were created, or sent forth,<note place="margin">Baruch 5.60. Psa. 148.8. Psa. 103. Psal. 104.

Moreover, he affirmeth in another place, that the wind, the whirlwind,<note place="margin">Job 38.8.</note> the ice, frost, clouds, and the lightnings, are ready at his command, whatsoever the will of the Creator is that they shall do, they are prepared to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, either upon the superficies of the earth, or for to punish and afflict the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or to shew mercy unto the righteous.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, I have expressed in the precedent definition, first, what is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall cause of the winde: namely, an airy substance of a mean consistency. Then I told you, that the eternall form, or essentiall act thereof, was the bright aspiration
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57108:50"/>
or spiracle of the Almighty, which did by his presence animate, agitate, and move the materiall aire. Thirdly, that the place wherein the winds are kept and reserved untill it pleaseth the Creator of them to employ and make use of them, was the heavens or aire, which is the cabinet of his treasures. And lastly, that the use and end of them was to accomplish the will of their Creator, when he did command them: and that either in their outward and airly estate, without revealing their centrall and formall fire, namely when the winds do blow, but are invisible; or else by emitting of their internall and essentiall light, as when they appeare and move in the form of Lightnings or coruscations: and this is proved evidently by the above-mentioned place, of the royall <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For these reasons therefore, and upon these grounds, we have framed out these Definitions of the wind which follow.</p>

                        <p>The Wind is an invisible aire or spirit, which is vivified and animated by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light, which issueth from the face of JEHOVA, as a breath out of his nostrills, to perform and accomplish his will and pleasure as well in Heaven above, as on the earth and waters beneath.</p>

                        <p>The Wind is a certain Angelicall Spirit, or subtill aire, which is inspired or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the fiery Spirit of JEHOVA, appearing sometimes visibly in the form of Lightning, and sometimes being invisible and occult, as when it is onely heard and not seen, and is ordained and sent forth by him from some corner of the earth, to effect and accomplish his will, either in his positive and benign property, or privative and destructive disposition.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Or thus,</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>The Wind is an invisible or occult Spirit, indued with a siery soul or form from above, and inspired by God in an Angelicall manner, the which is carried this way and that way, according unto the pleasure of him which inspired it, being moved or wafted on invisible wings, and carrying sometime their Creator on their airy plumes, to effect his will and pleasure.</p>

                        <p>The Wind is a certain Angelicall creature, being made and produced by JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVA, of aire, as being his matter agitated, and Light being his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and essentiall form, the which being derived or extracted out of his heavenly Treasury, is sent out this way or that way, either to plague and punish, or to solace and recreate the creature.</p>

Into the which practicall discourse, before we enter, I would wish each Reader to remember diligently, what hath hitherto been said, and to give an attentive eare unto this Preamble which I will set before it.</p>
                        <p>You ought seriously to remember, and consider, that the catholick informing Light, by which the Spirit of the Lord, that was carried upon the universall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters imparting unto them the Spirit of life, did inform, illuminate, and animate the catholick matter of the world, was by the consent of most of the antient Fathers, in <hi>Theology,</hi> said to be, the fourth day, contracted into the body of the Sun,<note place="margin">Ecclus. 42.</note> and for that reason it is said, <hi>Gloriae Domini plenum est opus Solis omnia illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strantis: The work of the Sun which inlightneth all things is full of the glory of the Lord.</hi> Hereupon also it may be understood: <hi>quod Deus induitur lumine quasi ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimento: God is cloathed with Light as with a vestiment.</hi> And in another place (the

                           <hi>He put his tabernacle in the sun</hi>: Whereby it is evident, that it was the pleasure of God, the Creator of all things, that this vessell should be rich and abundant in his Spirit, that from it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed in the center, heart, diapason, or perfect point of the world, it might by its vertuous harmony and life, order and govern the animall course, and temporall disposition, of generable and corruptible things on the earth, in the seas, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick sublunary element, namely, the universall aire, which as it is the vehicle of life in every sublunary thing, so also it is necessary to consider, that the aire is ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and inspired by it, as the higher angelicall natures receive their light and being from the Creator, before whose face they are alwaies present. I do not say, that the Sun giveth life, but the increated vertue in the Sun, which hath elected the palace of the Sun for his treasure-house, or cabinet of his vertue.

Now I would not that any man should mistake me, and think that I mean, that the whole Spirit of the Lord is included in the Sun; for, as I said, Christ was by Scripture reported to be rich and full of the Spirit. So God imparted unto the Sun abundance of his illuminating, positive, generative, and vivifying vertue; and yet neverthelesse he filleth all things, but not after one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, neither in one and the same property or proportion; for according unto that common course which he hath ordained, for the disposition or ordering of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall or yearly temper, where the Sun or his actuall tabernacle is more or lesse ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or far removed; there is the <hi>potentia divina,</hi> or the cold privative Spirit of God, more or lesse in operation, for there it acteth universally. As for example, When the Sun is absent, and under the earth, it causeth darknesse, coldnesse, dulnesse of aire, and a grosse spissitude to be present.

Now as these two have their dominion or depression by the presence or absence of the Sun, so also is the universall aire more cold, spisse, opake, and sluggish or stupid, when the Sun is farthest off; and again, more hot, subtle, bright, transparent, agil, and active, when the Sun is nearest. Mark therefore the properties of the aire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the glazen vessell of the Calender-Instrument, and remember, that it is but one and the same Spirit in essence, that worketh as well privativly as positivly; for it was one and the same Spirit which was called by the Prophet from the north and south, for the Text saith, <hi>Veni spiritus à quatuor ventis,</hi> &amp;c. wherefore this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is it, that governeth the universall sublunary aire, as well privatively as posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. And although this Spirit be most plentifully in the Sun, yet it being never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse every where, is able at all times, and in every place, to expresse himself in both properties. I come therefore unto the point or mark.</p>
                        <p>In the first Chapter of the first Book of this present Section, I have most clearly demonstrated unto you, that the aire included in the Weather-glasse, hath in every respect a relation unto the aire, or catholick element of the great world; where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it is proved, that the aeriall humid nature doth as exactly fill every place of the vaulted world, where the earth or water are not, lest any vacuity should be found in the cavity thereof, no otherwise than the dilated aire in the head and neck of the Weather-glasse doth fill the cavity thereof; and therefore as the aire included in the glasse doth work by dilatation at the presence of the Sun, namely, in the Summer-season, when the externall aire is hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ed; so also, and after the self-same manner, will the aire of this northern hemisphear be dilated, when the Sun is present, yea, and the nearer the Sun is, and the more perpendicular his beams are, the greater will the generall aire's rarefaction be, and consequently of that particular aire which is in the glasse. On the other side, when the Sun is absent from the Boreall hemisphear, namely, when it moveth beyond the Aequinoctiall, then will the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon aire in that hemisphear wax cold, and be contracted and condensed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the particular aire in the glasse will be contracted after the same propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which may easily be measured or conceived, by the degrees of ascent of the water in the glasse, as the rarefaction may be collected by the descent thereof. This therefore being well conceived or understood, and that the cause of this rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the presence of this divine act, in the sunny tabernacle, and that the reason of the condensation, is the absence or remotenesse of the said act, or operating and emanating Spirit, and consequently the presence of the divine puissance, which is darknesse; for (as we said) the absence of heat is the presence of cold, which is the essentiall worker in the divine puissance; and again, the presence of heat is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of cold. So also the absence of positive light conceiveth privative dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the absence of privative darknesse imparteth the presence of positive light.</p>
                        <p>We may easily hereupon collect the reason of the annuall winds, and perceive what their externall is; and how that aire is animated by the vivifying Spirit, which is sent out from the Sun. Consider therefore, that when the Sun is present with us, the Summer is created by his presence, the aire is calefacted by the bright beams of his Spirit, and by calefaction is rarified, and by reason of rarefaction of parts, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a larger place for his existency. As for example, We put two pound of Vitreol into a Retort, and fasten the nose thereof unto a huge Recipient or Receiver, stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the joynts fast, that the spirits do no way expire. We force out the Spirit from the Retort into the Receiver, and we find it tried by experience, that part of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treol being dilated into spirits, those spirits finding the ample Receiver not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to contain them, do violently break the Receiver into an infinity of pieces. Whereby it is made plain, that a thing which is condensed, will occupy but a small place: but when it is dilated, it will require a very large continent for his existence. All this is argued plainly by our experimentall Instrument; for when the Sun is present, the aire included is forthwith dilated more or lesse, according unto the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57108:52"/>
of the solar spirits, and winds that blow; but when it is dilated, it requireth by so much the more a larger place to be contained in, by how much the more it is dilated or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>arified; and that is proved thus, namely, because the water is thrust down by so many degrees lower, by how many the aire excelleth in rarity. So that it is evident, that the onely reason why the water is precipitated more and more downwards, is, because being by degrees subtiliated, it maketh it self a larger room to abide in.</p>
                        <p>Now that I have shewed you thus much, mark, that when the Sun commeth newly into an hemisphear, where winter did reigne, or had dominion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cold did incrass and thicken the aire, as for example, when it passeth from us into the southern hemisphear, to convert the winter estate of that part into summer; it doth forthwith begin to attenuate the aire of that part of the world, and that aire so rarified being animated, and, as it were, revived, by the operating beams of the Suns bright spirit, becommeth light-winged or feathered, wherefore it flyeth away from the south, and seeketh a larger place for his abode or entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being that the australl hemisphear is not sufficient to receive his dilated bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: For this reason, it is forced to pass a-traverse the Aequinoctiall, and to visit by a successive motion the northern hemisphear, and at its entrance therein, to make a windy noise, by reason of the thickness and coldness of the aire, which resisteth the hot vaporous, and lately dissolved or rarified aire, which is animated with the southern light, from whence it receiveth his agility. And this aire thus animated and forced by the divine act, in the Sunny tabernacle, to fly from the south unto the north, is that which we call the southern winde, which for this reason hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth so frequently among us in the beginning of winter, namely, immediately after the Sun hath passed the Aequinoctiall, that is to say, through <hi>Libra</hi> into <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>: This is the reason, that the southern winds (I say) are so plentifull among us in <hi>October, November,</hi> and <hi>December</hi>; and consequently, that we are saluted with such southern showers, by reason that the northern coldness doth condense the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive southern aire into clouds, as shall be told you in the description of the clouds.</p>
                        <p>All this is demonstrated out of the Weather-glass; for at the heat of onely a mans hand, being placed on the head of the Weather-glass, the included aire is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and so dilateth it self, and flyeth to an opposite Pole, namely, unto the heat of the cold water, the which it beareth down before it.</p>
                        <p>On the other side, the northern winds, and the ice and snow which are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in winter, are caused by that breath or spirit, which is sent forth from God in his potentiall and privative nature, the which he doth exercise or put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this world, when the treasure house of his actuall power is farthest; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath ordained the Magazin or store-house of his cold, in the poles of the world, being farthest off from the Aequinoctiall. For this reason, it is said in Scriptures,<note place="margin">Job 37.</note> that <hi>cold commeth from the north,</hi> and that <hi>before the cola of God who can consist</hi>? and that the <hi>breath of God maketh ice and frost.</hi> And again, <hi>Hast thou come into the treasure-house of the snowes,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Job 38.</note> 
                           <hi>or hast thou any knowledge in the treasury of the hail?</hi> Neither is Gods actuall light severed or distinguished from him, though he breathe at his pleasure from the north, in his potentiall or privative property; for darknesse unto him is as light. And for this reason also when he is displeased, he breatheth from the north as well in lightning and thunder,<note place="margin">Ezek. 1.</note> as in snow and hail. Whereupon <hi>Ezekiel</hi> said, <hi>Behold, a whirl-winde came out of the north, and a great cloud involved with fire,</hi> &amp;c. And yet both the cold, snow, hail, and frost, and the lightnings and melting heats, proceed but from one and the same spirit, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in properties,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.</note> which (as I said) was by the same Prophet called from the four winds, that is to say, one and the same word in essence, but multi-form in proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Of which the Psalmist, <hi>God sending forth his word upon the earth, by it he poureth down snow on the earth like wool, and disperseth the frost like ashes, who can resist against his cold? So soon as he sendeth out his word, it doth liquifie them; so soon as he bloweth forth his winde,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psal. 147.</note> 
                           <hi>the waters begin to flow, and the snow, frost, and ice to melt.</hi> Whereby it is evident, that God is ever one in himselfe, wheresoever he be, namely, be he in the north, where he operateth privation; or in the Sun, in which he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his actuall glory. Yet doth his Volunty as well as his Nolunty, that is, his positive property as well as his privative, accompany the unity of his essence. As for example, His negative property in his positive was discerned, when he made the Sun to stand still at <hi>Joshuah</hi>'s prayer, and to go backwards, or become retrograde,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57108:52"/>
for the confirmation of <hi>Hezekia</hi>'s belief. And his absolute privative; when at the death of our Saviour he contracted his manifested bright glory into the center: So that the Sun became as black as pitch. I conclude therfore, that when this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall property of the Divine Spirit doth move or act in the aire, the aire is suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked towards the pole or center, and so is made Frost, Snow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which space our experimentall Instrument sheweth a nature qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e contrary from the precedent: For after the imitation of the aire in the great world, it is contracted and sucked up into the bolts-head, as to the cold pole, and this then demonstrateth, that the catholick externall aire, doth also work after the same fashion. It appeareth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the reason of this emitted Spirit is occult, and not known unto any of us that are drowned in the abysse of Ignorance, but onely is made known unto him, who hath been so happy as to be instructed by the true Wisdome of God, which <hi>Solomon</hi> confesseth to be the worker of all things, and therefore the most faithfull Schoole-mistress to teach all mysteries.</p>
                        <p>But I will proceed further in the search and inquiry of this Ethnick Peripatetick man's skill in the Science and knowledg of <hi>Meteorology.</hi> And first, I will see what he can say, touching the Generation of the clowds and the rain.</p>

                        <p>How <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Doctrine touching the Generation of the Clowds, and production of the Drops of Rain, is found to be altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory unto the true Wisdome's Institutions.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE will now come unto our inquiry and examination of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s skill, in the watry Meteors: and because that the causes of mists, called <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulae,</hi> and thinner clowds termed <hi>Nubeculae,</hi> are comprehended under the title of <hi>Nubes</hi> or Clowds, I will onely insist upon the Mystery of the clowdy impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: For I purpose not to make any great Volume of words, to weary your eies with reading them over, but onely to touch with brevity such kinds of principall Meteors, as may in their generality include by their descriptions, every speciality that may be comprehended under them. I will therefore briefly begin with <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>'s opinion, and then compare it with the Testimony of holy Writ, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the essence of it may be examined with the fire of verity, to see whether it will indure the Test, or withstand the tryalls of Truth's touch-stone or no.</p>
                     <p>His opinion therefore with that of his Christian followers,<note place="margin">Aristotle<hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a Clowd.</hi>
                        </note> is, that, A clowd is produced of a vapour, which is elevated from the earth and water, into the middle region of the aire, by the attractive power of the Sun or Starrs, where it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and as it were congealed into the consistence of a visible clowd, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the extreame coldnesse of the place; the which clowd is afterwards partly by the heat of the Sun, and partly by the force of the winds, carried or forced this way and that way, through the middle region of the aire. Lo this is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Peripateticall definition of a clowd!</p>
                     <p>Now that we may the better gather and understand the truth of this business, and find out whether <hi>Aristotle</hi> be a true or a false Prophet in this his description; Let us here consider, what the Book or Bible of verity shall teach us concerning the Generation of a cloud, and how the members or clauses of this our definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do agree with the intention of it: which that we may more distinctly, and with the exacter method effect, we purpose in this place to compare their minds and senses together, that each person, though but meanly literated, may easily judge and determine of the case, as truly it standeth.</p>
                     <p>In the precedent Definition, he maketh the efficient and procreating cause, the heat or act of the Sun, saying, that by the attractive vertue thereof, the vapour which is the matter or substance of the clowd, is drawn out of the earth and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and sublimed into the middle region of the aire; averring also, that partly by the motion of the Sun, and partly by the winds it is moved this way and that way. Again, he surmiseth that the cause of the contraction, or condensation of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour into the consistence of a cloud, is the coldness of the middle region of the aire. So that unto the consistence of the clowd, he faineth that two Agents quite contrary in nature and condition unto one another, do concur and meet together, namely the heat of the Sun, and coldness of the middle region of the aire: but he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57108:53"/>
assigneth no internall cause of motion unto the clowd, esteeming it as a thing dead, and without an active spirit.</p>
                     <p>For this cause therefore, there do offer themselves unto each wise-man's consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, sundry doubts in this Definition to be throughly resolved and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of, before he will be able rightly to judge the verity thereof, namely, first whether the heat of the Sun do draw and attract vapours out of the earth and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, into the middle region of the aire, for the composing and shaping out of a clowdy Meteor. Secondly, whether the coldness of the middle region of the aire, be the occasion of the condensation, or thickning of a thin vaporous sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, into the consistence of a well compacted clowd. Thirdly, whether the clowds be only moved by externall efficient Agents, namely by the winds and Sun, as being destitute of any internall active principle or centrall Agent, or else if it be moved and animated by an internall Spirit. Unto either of these three questions or doubts, I purpose here to answer, in order as they are proposed.</p>
                     <p>Unto the first Objection therefore I say: That it is a most false and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tenent of the Peripateticks, that the Sun, Starrs, or fire, do draw unto them any vapours or exhalations: For it is proved by experience, that they rather expell and dissipate from them such things as are rarified by them, than draw and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure them unto them: neither is it true as most men falsly dream and surmise, that the Sun draweth fumes upward, or that the fire sucketh the vaporous substance of the attenuated water unto it; but their office is to rarify and subtiliate the waters and to reduce the moister part of the earth into vapour: And then it is naturally incident unto those light Substances, of their own inclinations, to ascend and mount upwards, without any other externall agent. But all this we have plainly demonstrated by our experimentall Instrument: For if you set your hand upon the bolts head or round glasse, on the top the aire will dilate it self, and presently fly away from the rarifying agent that dilateth it, and therefore much less will that agent suck or draw it unto it self. By which it is evident, that whereas it seemed in the eies of worldly wise-men, that because a vapour or fume ascendeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, therfore that motion from the Earth must needs proceed from the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive vertue of the Summer heat; now in the conclusion, it is proved to be stark false and erroneous, being that the nature of Heat and Light are clean contrary unto the attraction: forasmuch as they expell by dilatation, and do dissipate, and enlarge, which is contrary unto the condition of attraction, gathering together, and condensation, which are the properties of cold, as is mainfested by our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall <hi>Machin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now to prove that <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s grounds are most extravagant unto the Truth, who affirmeth that the clowds are made of a vapour drawn or elevated up into the middle region of the aire, we must understand, that the Opinion of the holy Scriptures is flatly adverse and contrary unto this clause or member of his defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or description, being that first it is easily to be gathered by this Text of St. <hi>Paul, That we ought to believe by Faith, that things visible were first made of such things which were not seen</hi>:<note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> and therefore it is neither the visible earth nor water, that can be the Originall of the clowds, but rather the invisible aire. And this is also maintained by divers plain Testimonies of Scriptures:<note place="margin">Job 28.24. Job 26.9.</note>

First, that God is the Father and Head, from whence this work, and all other, doth radically proceed; and the eternall efficient instrument, by which he acteth, is his Spirit of Wisdome: which also accordeth with this of the Apostle: <hi>Nobis est unus Deus Pater à quo omnia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp; unus Dominus Jesus Christus per quem omnia: To us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things; and one onely Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things.</hi> Secondly, That the aire is the main Subject as well of the watery as fiery Meteors, for by thickning or condensing of it, it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a consistence unto the clowds, and such-like Meteors, which are easily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward resolved into water and rain, and then by attenuating it extreamly, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh lightning: Not that I say, that the act of Lightning is of the Substance of the aire, but is rather an admirable Light, clothed with the aire as with a vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in the very same sense the Text saith, <hi>Indutus lumine quasi vestimento:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57108:53"/>
He is endued with light as with a vestiment.</hi> And again, the wise Philosopher, <hi>In lumine numen, in numine lumen.</hi> So that the thinner the aire is, the hotter it is, and consequently the richer in coelestiall fire, whose centrall act is divinity. Now that the aire is the substance or materiall subject of the watry Meteors, the precedent Text beareth it in these words, <hi>God by his Wisdom assigneth, or setteth by proportion, a weight unto the aire</hi>; that is, he thickeneth it into clowds, for the words following importeth so much, which are, <hi>Appendit aquas seu nubes in mensura, He hangeth or ballanceth the waters or clowds by measure, or attenuateth it into lightnings,</hi> as the words following do witnesse. So that he seemeth to aver, that the invisible aire is altered according to weight and measure, into the bodies or substances of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible clowds, which afterwards are resolved into rain, and fiery lightnings, which by compression do appear. Again, that it is neither the earth nor waters from which the existence or substance of a clowd is made, but onely the aire, we plainly do ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of these words in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 28.11.</note> 
                        <hi>Aperiet tibi IEHOVA the saurum suum op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>oelos, dando pluviam terrae tuae suo tempore: IEHOVA will open his best treasury, the heavens, giving rain unto thy earth in due season.</hi> Out of which words observe, first, that by the heavens is meant the Aire, for in the aire the clowds are procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and again, the aire is called heaven in many places of Scripture, as <hi>volatilia coeli, the fouls or birds of heaven.</hi> And therefore this is the <hi>sacrarium divinum,</hi> the divine treasury or treasure-house, out of the which God at his pleasure produceth and fashioneth the clowds. Secondly, that the aire is called his best treasury, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is out of it, that not onely he doth extract his meteorologicall creatures, but also that wise-men do enquire after their mysticall <hi>summum bonum,</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Philosophers that are well grounded, the character of the divine wisdom. Again,<note place="margin">Eccles. 43.17.</note> it is said in another place, <hi>Propterea aperti sunt thesauri, &amp; evolarunt nubes &amp; nebulae, sicut aves: Therefore his treasuries are opened, and the clowds did fly out like birds.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 37.21.</note> But this is made yet more evident, by these plain words of <hi>Job, Subitò aer condensabitur in nubes, &amp; ventus transiens fugabit eas: The aire will suddenly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densed or thickned into clowds, and the moving winde will drive them before it.</hi> By which words it is apparent, that the aire is the subject out of the which the clowds are compacted and framed, and that the heavens are the onely treasury, out of the which they are collected, and therefore neither the earth nor the water, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> would have it; which if it were true indeed, mark what an absurd impossibility must follow. For then whereas the Sun doth attenuate the aire in the summer-sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it would contrary unto reason condense it, by the continuall raising of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours; and then a greater absurdity would follow on the neck of this, to destroy <hi>Aristotles</hi> tenent, touching the generation of the clowds, for then we should have more clowds and rain in the summer, than winter, being that there are made more vapours at that season, by the Suns heat and emptying of ponds and rivers, then in the winter, which experience proveth false. And lastly, it is neither the heat of the Sun nor Stars, but the eternall Spirit of JEHOVA, whose dominion is over the angelicall winds, by which he moveth and operateth all these alterations in the air, and by the aire, as shall be told you hereafter. And therefore it was said, <hi>By his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he giveth weight unto the aire, and hangeth the clowds in measure, and assigneth rules unto the rain, and proportioneth a way or passage unto the lightnings and thunders, &amp;c.</hi> But I come unto the second Doubt.</p>
                     <p>To the resolution of the second doubt, I say, that there is another manner of reason, for the incrassation and condensation of an invisible vapour, or the aire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a cloud, than that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his followers have assigned, and set down; for whereas he saith, that this feat is performed, by the contractive cold of the middle region of the aire, it may be wondered at, why this effect is not wrought as well at other times, as when the winds do blow from their certain quarters of the earth; for when the southerly winds have dominion, then do we see clouds to multiply, and the rain to poure down in the greatest abundance. I would fain know of these Peripateticks, why the vapours should be raised so thick, just at that time when the wind bloweth from the south, to make a greater abundance of clowds in the aire, then at another season, namely, when they have no dominion? Or why should the cold of the middle region of the aire, be apter to coagulate or curdle va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours at that time, than at other times, being that the warm clouds, or dense aire, which is driven from the Aequinoctiall, do moderate the middle region's cold, through which they glide by reason of their hot temper? Verily I know, that they are ignorant what to answer touching this point, and therefore I will presse them
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57108:54"/>
no further. But I will tell you of an experiment of mine own, whereby I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced unto the truth, concerning the generation of the mists and clouds: When in my travells I went or journeyed from <hi>Venice</hi> unto <hi>Augusta,</hi> or <hi>Ausburg,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> as I travelled between the high mountains and rocks of the <hi>Alps,</hi> upon a certain day when the heavens were passing clear, and without any cloud to be seen in the Horizon, the Sun also (as in these times it must needs) being passing bright; I espied on the top of a steepy mountain, on the which the Sun-beams did strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beat, a certain fogg or mist by little and little to arise, and ever it thickned more and more, untill it grew from a sleight vapour unto a mist, and from a foggy mist at the last unto a thick cloud, and all this while the aire was every where clear, except only on that side the hill, from the top unto the bottom, which we beheld. It made me a little to marvell, and therefore alighting from our Coach, I took some grasse and flung it into the aire, to try which way the wind did blow, and I found it to be full upon or against that eminent hlll, which was advanced towards the heavens above his fellows. Whereupon I did streight-way gather, that the degrees of progression from a vapour unto a mist, and from a mist unto a fogg, and so forward unto the consistence of a clowd, was by compression of the common aire, which was chased before the winde by little and little, against the lofty rock or mountain, which hindering of it in its passage or flight, was the cause that the consequent-aire was added unto the precedent, and so by adding and compressing of parts of the aire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other parts, a perfect clowd, onely conformable unto that part of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, was made, which forthwith, when it became ponderous, and apt to endure the reflexion of the Sun, did resolve it self for four miles space on this side the rock into rain, all the rest of the aire remaining still clear, and without any clowd. Whereby I did forthwith conceive, that clowds were not ingendered after the manner described by the Peripateticks, that is, by the vapours rising out of the earth and waters, but by the inspissation or incrassation of the thin and invisible aire, into a thick, dense, and visible clowd, according unto the before-mentioned place of <hi>Job, Subitò aer condensabitur in nubes &amp; transiens ventus fugabit eas.</hi> But then I was a little troubled, when I remembred, that mountains and high rocks cannot by their resistance, and stopping of the fugitive aire, be alwaies the cause of the clowds; being that we find, that clowds do every where appear, yea, in the plain deserts, and open seas, where no hills are. Whereupon after that I had a little while considered, and well pondered this objection with my self, I did quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an infallible answer and resolution of this doubt, considering, that there is not a winde that bloweth in the heavens with dominion, but hath some opposite or transversall winde which bloweth with it, though it be not discerned by reason that the mightier winde doth darken or obscure the action of the weaker, even as in the open Sun a candle is scarcely to be discerned. Now that at one and the same time two or more winds do blow, I will prove it by common experience; for being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the seas, I have observed, that when the predominant winde hath fallen a little in his force by fits, and hath urged the sayl of the Ship but weakly, an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site winde hath immediately bewrayed it self, and moved the sail the contrary way, untill the other rising again, did replenish and fill up the sail towards our determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mark, which made for our purpose. But we have also Scriptures to testifie, that opposite winds do often blow at one and the same instant, for first, the self same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was evoked from the quarters of the four winds,<note place="margin">Ezekiel 37. Dan 7.</note> by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel, Ecce qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuor venti caeli pugnabant in mari magno, Behold, the four winds did fight together in a great sea.</hi> And <hi>Zacharias, Isti quatuor equi sunt quatuor venti coeli qui egrediuntur &amp; stant coram Dominatore omnis carnis:</hi>

                        <hi>These four horses are the four winds of the heaven, which goe forth and stand before the Lord of all flesh.</hi> Whereby it is evident, that not one or two winds, but many winds may blow in the heavens at once; for by their opposite blasts, clowds, whirl-winds, tempests, lightning, and thunders, are commonly effected. All which the profound Poet <hi>Homer</hi> seemeth to include in a few Verses, translated thus into Latin:</p>

                     <p>Where by <hi>Fratres, Boreas,</hi> or the North-wind, understandeth the Southern blast, and the other cardinall winds, the which when <hi>Boreas</hi> meeteth in the aire, do produce by their contentious struglings and wrastlings, thunder, whirl-winds, and such like tempestuous storms. And therefore we ought not to make any doubt, but that two or more winds do blow at one and the same time, either oppositely, or transversally in the open aire, whereby the intermediate invisible aire is by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression thickened, or condensed from the existence of a mean aire, into a scarce visible vaporous substance, and so unto a more visible misty corpulency; and lastly, into a most apparent and visible clowd, the which clowd neverthelesse is pushed and driven forward by that wind in the heaven, which hath the greatest dominion and denomination; for his power confirming in every point that which is spoken by <hi>Job,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 37.21.</note> and cited before, <hi>Subito aer condensabitur in nubes &amp; ventus transiens fugabit eas: The aire will suddenly be thickened into clouds, and the winde which moveth in the aire will drive them before it.</hi> So that it is easily to be gathered, that a clowd is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the aire after this fashion; The aire filling the whole vaulty heaven, and therefore the sublunary world is violently forced to move before the breath of one winde, and being encountered in its flight by an opposite winde unto the first, though of a weaker force, it resists the chased aire in its motion, and by that resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, aire being joyned unto aire, doth thicken by degrees, even as I told you the steep mountain or rock denying passage unto the aire, which flyed and eschewed the persecuting winde, was the cause of his condensation.</p>
                     <p>This therefore being rightly considered, it is apparent, that the Peripateticall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion is unjust and erroneous, forasmuch as it averreth, that a vapour raised out out of the earth and water, up to the middle region of the aire, is by the coldnesse of the place metamorphosed or changed into the form and substance of a clowd; the which also (as is already proved) is most improbable, because the southerly winds, which are the chiefest parents of the clowds, and rain in abundance, seeing that they are hot, by reason of the places temper from whence they are sent, would rather qualifie (as is already said) by their warmth, the coldnesse of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, through which they march or passe, and therefore would either disannull the effect of that property of cold, or else so weaken and dull the power of it, that if it produced any clowds, they would prove more thin and small ones, then any other of the cold winds; as also the winde <hi>Eurus</hi> would effect the same, by reason of his great heat. And yet we find all this quite contrary by experience, for the southerly winds do incrassate and produce clowds, that are in generall more moist and thick, then any of the other are accustomed to do; yea verily, the south winde doth so condense the aire by his presence, that (as <hi>Isidorus</hi> doth affirm) it maketh objects

                     <p>Touching the third and last doubt, which is, Whether the clouds be onely Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially moved by externall winds, and the heat of the Sun, as <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is, and not by any centrall agent, which ruleth it, as it pleaseth, and at whose Command the winds themselves are obedient.

Therefore it is said in one place: <hi>Nubibus densis obtegit Deus coelos,</hi>

In which relation of holy Writ, what I have spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is notably set forth. For first it is said, that God ascended or mounted on the Cherubin, which is an airy Angell; then that he did glide upon the wings of the wind: arguing thereby that the aire being animated by the Angelicall Spirit was made a wind, in the which the Word or Spirit of God did move: and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, he in and by the wind did shape out his dark Tabernacle: For it is said: <hi>He made darkness his hiding place</hi>; that is, he made the dark clowds his Chariot: For <hi>David</hi> hath it thus,<note place="margin">Psal. 104.3.</note>

That God doth move in the Thunders, speaketh out of the whirl-wind and clowds, and is at his pleasure a consuming fire; and that he operateth centrally in the winds, clowds, Snow, and Tempests, and that all these are effected by his Spirit of Wisdome; the Scriptures do here and there in most places express. And therefore it is vainly said that the clowds only move by the Sun-beams, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall pushing winds, caused of so vain impossible Principles as <hi>Aristotle</hi> telleth us, when it is the Tabernacle in which that Eternall Spirit is pleased to abide, or a Chariot in which he is delighted to ride, whose horses (as <hi>Zachary</hi> saith) are the

winds, or rather the Cherubinicall Spirits, which he doth animate. So that the volunty or centrall principle of the motion is in the clowd, but the Angells and winds are the Ministers or organicall Agents, which move according unto the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, wherefore though we proved before that the aire was thickned into clowds, and that the following wind did drive them before it, yet the willer and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this Generation of clowds by the winds, was the onely and essentiall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall principle or centrall mover in the clowds, which by his will made his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to move him,<note place="margin">Prov. 30.20.</note> where or to what purpose he pleased.

And therefore the cloud acteth not by the heat of the Sun, but by the Divine Light that is centrally in it, which, as an Emperour, sitteth upon the Cherubins, which are airy and windy Angels, as the Seraphins are fiery Spirits, and so moveth upon the wings of the wind or aire, which his Angelicall Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin doth animate.

It is (I say again) the all-creating Spirit, and not the created, which is the generall act, and onely formall mover in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, whom his Angelicall Ministers (which do ever stand before this Lord of all the earth, that I may speak with the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi>) are ready to assist as Organs or instrumentall causes to execute his will.

                        <p>A clowd is the reducing of the invisible aire, into a visible, thick, and gloomy consistence, which is by the will of God effected, through the concurrence or meeting together of opposite or transversall winds, for the accomplishment of his secret will and pleasure.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>In which definitions, or rather descriptions, the materiall substance seemeth to be a coagulated mist, or condensed masse or heap of aire, the formall cause is set out in the shape and form of the clowd; the efficient cause, or centrall agent, is the essentiall act of the divine wisdom, who employeth and exciteth his windy mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to work externally by the way of compression. We have also the magazine or treasury, out of which the substance of the winds is produced, namely, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens or aire, which is termed, <hi>Arca Dei thesauraria, The chist or cabinet of Gods trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</hi> To conclude, the finall cause is manifested in this, that the clowd is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to bring forth the effects, as well of Gods clemency and benignity, as of his severity and anger.</p>
                     <p>Now for the defence of the first part of these descriptions, we find it thus written, <hi>Deus sapientia suâ apt at pondus aeri &amp; appendit aquas in mensura, facit pluviae statuta &amp; viam fulgetro tonitruum, &amp;c. God doth by his wisdom proportionate the weight of the aire,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 28.25.</note> 
                        <hi>and hangeth the waters or clowds in measure, assigneth lawes unto the rain, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a way unto the lightnings of the thunder.</hi> That is to say, according unto the will and ordination of the divine Spirit, the aire or substance of heaven is changed from a lighter or thinner estate or weight, unto a heavier or thicker, the degrees of which mutation are expressed in the words following; for first it was aire, then clowds, then rain, or vulgar water. Also the Text doth seem to make the lightnings inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or formall light of the clowd, which is not revealed, but by the violation or ruption of the compound, and ablation of darkness. Again, it is said by <hi>Job,</hi> (as is already related) <hi>Aer condensabitur in nubes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ecclus. 43.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp; ventus transiens fugabit eas; The aire will be thickned into clowds.</hi> And touching the clowds of snow, <hi>Congregatio spiritus aspergit nivem, The aire being gathered together, doth scatter the snow on the earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching the efficient cause, it appeareth to be God, or the eternall Wisdom; and therefore in the precedent Text it is said, <hi>Deus sapientia sua aptat pondus aeri, &amp; appendit aquas vel nubes in mensura: God by his wisdom hangeth or ballanceth the waters or clowds in measure.</hi> And again, <hi>Nubibus densis obtegit Deus coelos, God cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the heavens with thick clowds.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 147.8.</note> But all this is sufficiently expressed before. As for the finall cause, set down in the foresaid definitions, it is confirmed by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in this fashion, <hi>Pro irrigatione fatigat Deus den sam nubem, &amp; dispergit lucem nubis suae,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 37.40.</note>

God wearieth the thick clowd for the watering of the earth, and he disperseth every where the light of his clowd, whatsoever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them to be done upon the earth, whether it be for a scourge, or else in favour and benignity,</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>NOw I think it most fit to demonstrate unto you, how the clowds are procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the opposite blast of two winds of a contrary nature, namely, of the Southerly wind in eminency and dominion, and a Northerly spirit which also bloweth, but insensibly. I told you in the Chapter, where I did demonstrate by our experimentall Instrument, the reason of the Southerly winds which happen in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that as the aire included in the Weather-glasse, did by the onely touch of a warm hand dilate it self, and in dilatation fly from the hand of the toucher, unto the cold region of the water, which was evidently proved and maintained, because the water did suddainly thereupon move downward: So also the grosse winter aire in the southern hemisphear, did at the approach of the Sun unto the parts beyond the Line, dilate it self, by vertue of that ever-acting and subtiliating spirit, which put his tabernacle in the Sun; so that the southern dilated aire posted apace, or flew ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily away, to seek a larger place; but comming into the northern hemisphear, (which by reason of the Sun's absence, became brumall or wintry) the constant aire of that region being now contracted by the northern cold, and the north-wind, by reason of the colds dominion, blowing more or lesse, though insensibly, it meeting with the warm southerly spirit, condenseth it with the rest into clowds; and this is the reason, that alwaies almost, (and that is, where no northern blasts are discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) that the southerly winds do bring abundance of clowds and rain with them, for that the hot southerly vertue of the divine agent, doth more and more subtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and rarifie the winter aire which it found there, till it had by rarefaction puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it, and reduced it unto the nature of a true Summer aire; so that the superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of the aire after rarefaction, were chased away (as is said) into the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern region, where it is condensed again, partly by the privative act of the divine puissance, and partly by the spissitude of the northern aire, which denyeth it free passage into the form of clowds: For the cold spisse aire of the northern hemisphear, agitated and animated by the northern blast or property, resisteth the hot vaporous aire, and so it condenseth by little and little.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, I could here set down the Aristotelian definitions of the snow, frost, hail, ice, and such like other meteors; and then check and contradict them mainly, by other true descriptions of them, proved by the testimony of holy writ. As for example, <hi>Aristotle</hi> seemeth to aver, that the snow is a clowd, congealed by the great cold, which before it be perfectly dissolved into water by a vaporous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, it is changed into a snowy substance. In which definition, because he is ignorant, as hath been proved already, in the fabrick of a clowd, we ought in no case believe him. Again, he digresseth from the tenour of Scriptures, according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mind whereof, we have defined the snow thus.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>The Snow is a meteor which God draweth forth of his hidden treasury, in the form of wool, to effect his will upon the earth, either by way of punishment or clemency.</p>

                     <p>Or thus.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>The Snow is a creature produced out of the air, or heavenly treasury of God, by the cold breath or blast of the divine spirit, in the form of wool, to perform his will on the earth.</p>

                     <p>Where the fountain of his originall substance is made the aire, or the matter of the heavens; and therefore the Text hath it, <hi>Congregatio speritus aspergit nivem, The gathering together or condensation of the spirit,</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>What <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s opinion is, touching the generation of Fountains and Rivers, and whether he in his opinion doth jump with the verity of the true wisdom.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>SInce therefore it is apparent, that <hi>Aristotles</hi> doctrine is erroneous and deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, touching the generation and essence of the winds and clowds, we purpose in the third place to bring his judgment and opinion, concerning the beginning and originall of fountaines and rivers, unto the touch-stone of truth, that thereby we may perceive, whether it will endure the tryall, and not shrink (as the proverb is) in the wetting.</p>
                     <p>The Peripateticks, as well Christians as Gentiles, are as much deceived in their meteorologicall grounds, concerning the generation of fountains and rivers, as in the rest, of which we have spoken before; and therefore their Master <hi>Aristotle</hi> (all things being well pondered in the ballance of justice) ought to be accounted of all true Christians, for a seducer and deceiver of the world; and consequently his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine touching this point, ought of right to be repudiated and rejected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristotle,</hi> with his peripateticall sect or faction, are of opinion, that being the belly or bowells of the earth is full of cavities, and hollow passages; vapours, to avoid vacuity, must needs ascend from the center or bottom of it, the which cleaving in their ascent unto the sides of the hollow vaults, and streighter passages or veines of the earth, do resolve into water, which distilling down by drops, do ingender fountaines and rivers.</p>
                     <p>In the which opinion of theirs they conclude, that the matter of fountains is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but a vapour arising from the bottom of the earth, and resolved, liquefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or condensed into water, through cold and heat together within the earth; no otherwise then after their saying, the clowd, rain, snow, and hail do arise, and are generated in the aire of a vapour, first condensed, and afterwards liquefied.</p>
                     <p>But if we shall duely examine every member of this their description, we shall perceive, that they require as well a double matter, as formall agent in this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of fountaines; for they faign, that the remote matter is a vapour, and then the near and immediate matter they imagine to be drops of water, which are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the concretion or condensation of that vapour. Also they make their two efficient causes, cold and heat; for, say they, it is the office of cold to condense and congeal the included vapour into water, and that it is the heat and cold together, which maketh the water fluxible and moovable. Let it therefore be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me (<hi>judicious Reader</hi>) to answer these Peripatetick Philosophers, with an over-worn axiom of their own, and consequently to fight with them at their own weapons. Their axiom is, <hi>Erustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora. That is vainly done or effected by many, which may be effected by lesse.</hi> Now if that this originall work in the producing of fountains, may be performed most conveniently by one and the self-same subject of water, without the altering of it, first, into vapour by subtiliation, and afterward by condensing again that subtle vapour into water; Then I make no doubt but you will conclude with me, that this Peripatetick defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition is vain, imaginary, and sophisticall, by their own rules. But I will make it apparent hereafter, by an ocular demonstration, that it is possible by a course in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture onely, that water without any alteration of his consistence, may by the secret veines, and close passages or conduits of the earth, be drawn or sucked up out of the huge seas, unto the top or summity of the mountains, after by his soaking through the sands, and pory substance of the earth, it hath left his salt nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it; which appearing evidently to every mans sense, the vanity of <hi>Aristotles</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention will soon be discovered unto wise men. Besides all this, the sterility of his reason or invention, which would faign, that these vapours cleaving unto the sides of the caverns or hollow places, and that there (forsooth) they must be converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to drops of water, which from thence must issue forth into rivers, will be palpable and manifest, if we consider, that these drops so made, are apter to circulate, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57108:57"/>
readier to fall down again into the bowells of the earth, from whence they came, by those self-same vaulty passages or hollow veines, through which they ascended, than to issue forth of the ground allaterally, because that every heavy thing is more prone to descend, then to move sidelong. And therefore it is likely, that either all the waters so made, or the greater part must needs return downward by the way it came or ascended in the form of vapour. But omitting these reasons for a while, we must see if the Text, which is conteined in the Book of Verity, do consent in this Opinion with <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his faction, yea or no.</p>
                     <p>We find in the first place, that it is not an accidentall and imaginary heat or cold, that acteth in this Meteor's Generation, but God who operateth by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Spirits, and solar act in the accomplishment of this business. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that in his action, as well privative as positive, cold and heat do expresse themselves as his Ministers: For the Text saith, <hi>Coram frigore ejus quis consistat: Who can stand against his cold?</hi> Yet it is his catholick positive act, which he extendeth out of his sunny Tabernacle, and hotter winds, and privative vertue, which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesteth in the longinquity and absence of his bright Tabernacle, from the region pointed at, and the propinquity of the polar seat of the colder winds, to alter annually the created Element. And therefore it is God which by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Organs, as well in Heaven above, as Earth and Water beneath, that operateth all things, and amongst the rest, produceth the Fountains of which the rivers are made.<note place="margin">Wisd. 1.</note> And consequently we ought to esteem it the Act of God's Spirit which filleth the earth, (as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith) and operateth all the naturall effects therein.<note place="margin">Psal. 104.10.</note> Which also <hi>David</hi> doth testify in these words: <hi>Qui emittis fontes per valles, ut inter montes ambulent &amp; potum praebeant omnibus animantibus agri, frangant onagri sitim suam: Qui irrig at montes è caenaculis suis, faciens ut ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minet foenum adjumenti, &amp; herbam ad hominis usum: Who sendeth forth the fountains through the valleys, that they may run between the mountains, and give drink unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry living creature of the field, that the Asse may quench his thirst, and that they may water the mountains from their cells, causing the grass to grow for the use of the Oxe, and the herb for the benefit of man,</hi> &amp;c. So that here we have the sole catholick Agent, and therefore the Operator of fountains as is proved by this Text. Again, here we have the finall cause set down, for the which they were created and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in succession by God, namely to water the earth; for the giving drink unto all cattell, and living creatures, and for the multiplying of grasse, herbs, trees, and fruit, for the use as well of man as beast. But will our Peripateticks say, we hear no news out of Scripture, for the contradicting of our matter assigned for the composition, or consistence of Fountains, which we say to be a vapour, and not water, in its naturall substance: Neverthelesse, to qualify this their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to make them behold the Truth without Spectacles, I counsell them to give eare unto this assertion of <hi>Solomon: Omnia flumina</hi> (saith he) <hi>intrant in mare, &amp; mare non redundat, ad locum unde exeunt revertuntur ut iterum fluant: All rivers enter into the Sea, and it is never the bigger, they return unto the place from whence they came,</hi>

                        <hi>that they might flow again.</hi> By the which Speech of the wise-man, expressing the materiall cause of Fountains, the foresaid definition of <hi>Aristotle</hi> is utterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, for this doth evidently prove, that it is one and the self-same water, and that in the plain form of water, without any transmutation of it out of water into vapour, and then from vapour into water again, as he doth erroneously alledge, which moveth from the Sea unto the Mountains, and from the Mountains unto the Sea again: Insomuch that for this onely errour, some of his earnest disciples have become Apostates, or renegado's unto his doctrine: For <hi>Joannes Velcurius,</hi> (a learned man in the worldly Philosophy, and one who hath sweat and taken great pains in the Aristotelian doctrine: insomuch that he wrote a Comment on his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks) when he cometh to speak of the Generation of Fountains,<note place="margin">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57108:58"/>
they return again unto the place from whence they came,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby it is plain, that he must accuse his Master of false doctrine, or else he must condemn <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Judgment. For if the one be contradictory unto the other, it ought of all wise-men to be chased away, or expelled from Christian mens remembrance: Now it were a foolish thing for any religious person to say, that the divinely-wise <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> lied, to save the reputation of the Ethnick of diabolically wise <hi>Aristotle.</hi> But if they would, yet will I teach them in the next Chapter, by an evident ocular demonstration, that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s assertion is most true, and that of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s most erroneous and fantasticall.</p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore, that I gather out of the aforesaid places of the Bible, that this following Definition doth best agree with the nature of a Fountain.</p>
                     <q>A Fountain is a continuated Flux of water, issuing from the Sea, as from his beginning, and flowing into bowells of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after that from the bowells of the earth, as from the mean by which it passeth, unto the upper or higher Superficies of it, by vertue of the divine act, in the mundan Spirit, as well positive or dilative, as privative and contractive; for the benefit and sustenance both of man and beast.</q>
                     <p>In which definition, plain water without any alteration of his shape, is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for the materiall cause, and is said to have its beginning from the Sea, from whence it moveth unto the Mountain's tops.

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Did advertise you (Learned Reader) in my precedent discourse, that Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth operate annually in the common Element of the Sublunary world, by a double vertue, whereof the one is dilative, which is effected in his positive, and manifest property, namely in his light, active, and warm disposition, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Treasury and store-house whereof he hath made the Sun: Forasmuch as his bright emanating Spirit of Wisdome, did elect that pure vessell for his Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. The other is contractive, which is effected in his privative, and secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, namely in his dark fixing and cooling disposition, whose principall treasury is about the poles: Forasmuch as it being contrary in effect with the first, is seated in the farthest quarters or points of the world from the Sun. So that as the vivify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit which is seated in the Sun, doth by his presence, operate onely by dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the common sublunary Element, in banishing of the Northern cold, and undoing the actions thereof, by the way of Rarefaction: In like manner by the absence of the Sun, the spirits of the Polar property, doth take possession of that portion of the Element, and undoeth by the way of congelation, all the subtill actions of the Spirituall and active solar vertue. As for example; all that in the winter time among the nations of the Southern world, that is to say, beyond the line, the Sun being then in the Northern Hemisphere, causing by his vertuous Spirit our Summer season, the Antartick pole's cold property doth effect, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thickning the aire; raising the Fountains or Springs, and multiplying the waters, producing the Snows, Frost, Ice, and Hail: mortifying the herbs, fruits, and plants, and such like, the Sun at his next visitation of those quarters, which will be in our Northern winter, by the vetue of that dilating and vivifying Spirit, from the Fountain and Father of Light, which aboundeth in it, will undo; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the thick aire to thin, striking down the Fountains more towards the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of the Earth, which were raised in the winter: dissolving the Snow, Frost,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57108:58"/>
ice, and hail, and of fix and opake bodies, making them movable and transparent waters, reviving the spirit of the trees, plants, and herbs, which were almost live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse through congelation, and renewing their mourning bodies with new green garments, blossoms, and flowers, and lastly, with wholsome fruit.

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> averred, that the seas, for all the comming in of rivers, are never the greater, so also, though fountains rise in one part of the world, and sinke in another; and although also the aire by attenuation, made by the active spirit of the Lord, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth from the warm or summer hemisphear, unto the cold and winter hemisphear, yet is the world no bigger or lesser in its existency, for all that. What therefore the winter properly doth operate in one hemisphear of the world, the summer-hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphear must needs act in the same proportion in the contrary; for if beyond the Line are made great raines in their winter, we must needs have great drought in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer on this side the Line. When it is hottest with us, it will be coldest with them; if it prove temperate with us, it will be so with them; as the Sun being in the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, maketh daies and nights equally long, and the season temperate to both hemispheares. These things therefore being considered maturely in the first place, I proceed unto my practicall conclusion: and my naturall observation thereupon is, that the aire included in the Weather-glasse is made Hybernall, or of the nature of winter, by the dominion of cold; for as soon as the head of it feeleth the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cold, the contained aire will immediately shrinck up, and contract it self into a little space, and consequently the aire is made more dense and thick: and that this is so, it appeareth by the mounting or attracting up of the water, for there is such a naturall tye betwixt the one and the other, that if the one contracteth it self in a narrower place, namely the aire, then the water will immediately mount up with it, and to it, because it is contiguous unto the aire. By this therefore it is apparent, that the contracting and attracting vertue of the northern spirit, or rather divine puissance, which is made manifest in cold, doth first attract, contract, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dense the dilated aire, and then the aire so contracted by the northern spirit, doth draw or attract the water from beneath upwards, and that without altering of that water which was beneath, in any thing from that which is above; so that in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, it is but one and the self-same water. Lo here therefore it is by this demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proved feazible and possible, that water may be sucked and drawn from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns of the earth, which is fostered and maintained by the sea, even unto the top of the high mountains, and that by a naturall means or operation, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of altering the form of the water into vapour, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth vainly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize, and that contrary unto his axiom, <hi>Frustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciora, That is vainly done by many, which may be effected by a fewer.</hi> Contrariwise we see and observe in the Weather-glasse, that if the dilative vertue of the present Sun or hot winds, doth heat the head of the Weather-glasse, or inflame the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aire, then the aire within the glasse will also dilate it self, and by its dilatation will strike down or precipitate the water, that the aire contracted by cold had sucked or drawn up; and again, the visible sinking of the water doth point at, and prove, the invisible dilatation of the air.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>That the actions of contraction and dilatation, and consequently of attraction and expulsion of aire in the Weather-glasse, with the effects of the elevation and depression of the water which are caused thereby, are most conveniently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto the aire and water in the world.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE must consider, (as I have said before) that the catholick air and water in the world, filleth the whole vaulty cavity thereof no otherwise, then the air in the Weather-glasse filleth the hollowness thereof; so that the fountains of all the world issuing from one sea, do seem to penetrate into the bowells of the earth, and fill the generall veines thereof, being sucked and drawn up unto them by that self-same reason, by the which the water is exalted into the uppermost part of the neck of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57108:59"/>
the glasse; and by this reason there is an evident relation between the fountaines of the northern hemisphear, and those of the southern, forasmuch as it is expressed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the southerly aire, which is on that side the Aequinoctiall line, is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in his homogeneall nature with that on this side the line: So that the flying dilated aire passeth from the south, and is condensed into clowds in the north. Wherefore it is apparent, that the matter which feedeth the fountains in the north, are more or lesse continuated unto those of the south, as the waters that are raised up into the highest degree of the glasse are continued with them in the lower all which is fed and maintained with the pot of water, which we compare unto the sea.</p>
                     <p>We conclude therefore thus, when the hot spirit of the Sun in the depth of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, doth marvellously rarifie the aire in our northern hemisphear, then that aire seeking every where to make place for her enlarged spirits, (as we see in the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the spirit of Vitriol, it breaketh the Receiver, to seek a larger place to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in) doth no otherwise depresse and beat down the northern fountains, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating it self, than the aire included in the glass doth the water that is therein. And again, the cold which at that season doth domineer in the southern part, by reason of the absence of the Sun, doth as fast suck, attract, or draw up the fountaines of that part, by the contracting of that aire, no otherwise, then the externall cold doth contract the aire in the Weather-glass, and by contraction attracteth and sucketh or draweth up the water therein. So that here we have two means of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and depressing of fountains, for as the spirits calefying act doth strike them down over all the northern hemisphear in the Summer; so the spirits cold act doth raise them up in the southern hemisphear, in which winter hath his dominion. So that there are two agents to pull it down, or to depress it in the northern parts, namely, the present northern Sun, or divine positive act, and the absent southern cold, or divine privative act. Again, when the Sun is removed from the northern regions into the southern, having passed the Aequinoctiall barr, the self-same effects will happen, but in contrary parts, namely, then the cold of the north will help to raise them in the north, and pull them down in the south; and again, the southern heat will depresse them in the south, and consequently help to raise them up in the north. This is demonstrated thus:
<figure/>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which figure, <hi>EFG</hi> is the northern hemisphear, where the Sun is absent, and therefore winter inhabiteth there, and cold hath his dominion. <hi>EHG</hi> is the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern hemisphear, where the Sun is present, and therefore summer dwelleth there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and heat hath dominion. <hi>EG</hi> is the Aequinoctiall line, which is as it were the barr, that divideth the northern region from the southern. <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B</hi> is the hollow vein
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57108:59"/>
in the earth, which continueth from the northern region to the southern, that there might be a relation between, or continuation in some measure, of the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern and southern waters, as well as of the northern and southern aire of heaven; for being the wide sea <hi>D.</hi> which stretcheth from north to south, is the head, from whence all springs and rivers do originally arise, I see no reason that it should seem strange to any man, that I say, the northern fountains have relation by a continui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of substance unto the southern, and therefore the southern unto the northern. Wherefore I conclude, that when the catholick northern aire of the hemisphear <hi>EFG</hi> is cold, it sucketh or contracteth unto it the aire in the vein of the earth <hi>A,</hi> the which aire being contracted, elevateth of the water out of the wide sea <hi>D,</hi> as is evidently demonstrated by the Weather-glasse; for when the cold externall aire hath contracted by congelation the aire in the head and neck of the glasse, (which head and neck I compare unto the veine in the earth; for the vein of the earth is close, and expireth no way) then the water is drawn up by the contraction of the aire, out of the vast water in the pot or basin, which I compare unto the sea. On the other side, in the summer or southern hemisphear <hi>EHG,</hi> where the Sun is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the catholick aire is subtiliated or rarified; and dilating of the aire about the fountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the cavity of the vein, beateth down and abaseth the water in the southern mouth of the vein in the earth <hi>B,</hi> towards <hi>C</hi>: so that oftimes in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the springs are found either dried altogether, or at the least-wise much depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Now therefore I say, that by reason of the depression of the waters in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly south, by way of subtiliation of the aire, and exhausting or drawing them up in the winterly north by the cold, the water is the apter to be raised in the cold north. Again, the elevation of the waters in the north, which were the summer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore depressed, is effected by the empty aire's contraction, which possesseth the place in the summer time in the vein of earth where the water was, as we see in the Weather-glasse, and by the dilation of the aire in the south, the water is easily there hid in the earth. So that it appeareth, that it is partly driven and pressed down in the south by heat, and consequently with the greater ease drawn up at the north, and partly elevated in the north by the cold winter: as if a chord were put into a hole of a great piece of timber, downward at one end, and did ascend upward at the other, thus:</p>
                     <p>If from the north <hi>A</hi> the chord be strongly
<figure/>
pulled up; and again from the south <hi>B</hi> it be as strongly pushed or depressed down, it will the easier sink by the south <hi>B,</hi> and mount in the north <hi>A.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The self-same will happen, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary order, when the Sun, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly summer is in the northern hemisphear <hi>EFG,</hi> for then the springs will be there depressed, and in the southerly parts exalted. The seas draining or soaking into the bowells of the earth <hi>D,</hi> being the <hi>commune medium,</hi> or cistern of both extreams, as well to receive the water pressed down, and distributing upward of that superfluity unto the surging, increasing, or winter fountaines.</p>
                     <p>Thus therefore do you see evidently,<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.</note> how <hi>Solomon</hi>'s saying is proved true, <hi>All rivers run into the sea, and the sea is not the greater; they return into the place from whence they came, that they may run or flow again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But let us examine <hi>Aristotles</hi> opinion a little better, that we may the more plainly expresse the absurdity thereof: If that it were a vapour which was sent up out of the bowells of the earth, it must proceed from some mighty heat which must alter that great mass of cold water, which is in the bowells of the earth, into that vapour; but admit that this were so, then mark what absurdities would follow: First, he confesseth, that the fountaines are colder in the summer than in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because the externall heat doth <hi>per Ant peristasin,</hi> or by a contrary act pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and keep in, and therefore multiply the inward cold of the earth; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, as it appeareth by the coldness of fountaines in the summer, then by that self-same reason, this fortified cold of the earth in the summer season, must needs also keep in, preserve, and fortifie in the center of the earth, that inward heat which causeth those vapours, which are the originall of fountains. Mark the conclusion, for if that be so, namely, that the centrall heat in the summer should be greater, then would the vapours be in greater abundance in summer, for the greater the fire is, the more will be the smoak. And again, by reason of the great cold in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57108:60"/>
of the earth, those vapours would be more suddenly condensed into watry drops, and consequently by that means, we should have higher Fountains, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Floods, and more swelling Rivers in the Summer time then in the Winter; all which experience teacheth us to be erroneous; and, to conclude, <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this must needs be false. But it will be (I know) objected, that it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested unto the eye, that standing ponds, and such like humid places, are dried by the Summer heat, and how can that be, but because the Sun doth attract the moisture and consumeth it by converting it into vapours? I answer: For the first, that the Sun doth not draw but onely rarify, and then the thing rarified doth tend upward. But that the Sun should spend all those moistures of Lakes and Ponds that way, namely by converting in into aire; If that were possible, I will tell you what absurdity would follow, namely that the Sun by reducing all the waters into vapours, should thicken the aire, when contrariwise our Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass teacheth us by that model of aire, which is contained in it, that it doth attenuate and rarify the aire and not thicken it. Again, a greater errour would fall foul on the neck of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Doctrine concerning the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of clowds, if this were so. For whereas his Opinion is, that a clowd is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from vapours extracted out of the earth and water, by the attractive force of the Sun and Starrs; it would follow then, that in the Summer-time we should have more clowds and more rain then in the winter: But this is as false as the rest. But I say rather, that because the aire is more rare and thin in the Summer, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the presence of the divine act in the Sun, which rarifieth and attenuateth the aire by his assidual action, and therefore we have fewer clowds in the Sommer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For (as I proved before) the clowds are made by the compression of aire, and the aire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain is by a circular course renewed, by the resolution of those Meteors it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into their first invisible matter which was but aire. I must confess that some part of the waters are subtiliated and by dilatation thrust into the winter Hemis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, but the greatest part doth sink down by the insensible pores of the dry and thirsty earth, which drinketh it up, and keepeth it in her bowells, till it be sucked out by the contraction of the aire, which filleth the pores and cracks thereof: which contraction happeneth by the cold of the winter following. For we see that if there be but a Hogshead full of water, it will indure a long time before the hot Sun will exhale it by subtiliation. Moreover, it is certain that what the Sun doth rarify in the day time, so that it riseth in a vaporous form upon the earth; in the night time, it falleth commonly again in foggy mists and dew. So that it is removed out of a contracted place, and dilated and besprinkled in mist and dew over the wide and spacious fields. Now that this is so, it is made evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we shall ever observe, that the Summer mists and dew is most frequent about Lakes and Rivers. I will for a conclusion of this Book and whole Section, onely examine our princely Peripateticks Opinion, touching the Lightnings and the Thunders, that we may perceive therein also the validity of his Physicall Doctrine.</p>

                     <p>HAving thus made a generall inquiry into the Philosophy of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Originall of the Winds, the Clowds, and Fountains, I cannot now but enter into his thoughts, concerning the wonderfull beginning or primary causes and admirable effects of the Lightnings and Thunders, being in verity they are Meteors of so great marvell, that they require the profoundest speculation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them justly and as they ought to be, and therefore I doubt not but that if a due examination be made of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s validity concerning the research and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of so great a mystey, it will be more faulty then all the rest. Let us then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in the first place, what his mind is touching the essence of the Lightnings. <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Opinion is, that the materiall cause of the Lightning, is, a hot and dry exhalation, drawn out of the earth, and elevated into the middle region of the aire, by the vertue of the Starrs: where partly by reason of a strong collision or concussion of clowds, and partly because of that <hi>antiperistasis</hi> which is had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

the heat of the exhalation and coldness of the region, that inflamable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so coarcted into the belly of the clowd is set on fire, and breaking out of his prison doth tend downward, by reason of his terrestiall and compacted dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and he concludeth that the violence of this eruption,<note place="margin">

                        </note> is, that noise which men do commonly call by the name of Thunder. This I say, is the summary of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s mind touching the Lightning. And verily, <hi>Aristotle</hi> seemeth in some sort to be excused, if he erre in this inquiry, being that it is a doubt not easily to be resolved, and therefore not only he, but also all other Philosophers almost have been in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>onstant in their resolutions, touching this point: Forasmuch as therein they have so staggered, and varied in this research, and have groped as it were by dark, for the finding out of the true light thereof. For <hi>Empedocles</hi> judged the Lightning to be caused by the interception, or stopping of the descent of the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames. But <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> would have it to be a portion of the aethereall or heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fire, which descended from above, into the concavity of the clowd, within the which afterward it was inclosed; and saith, that this light skipping and gliding out of the clowds, is called the Lightning, the effect of whose breaking forth, is, the Thunder. Others will have these flashes of fire to proceed from the dry winds; which being compassed about, compressed or coarctated within the clowds, these clowds are by them are set on fire, &amp; thereupon cometh that noise which followeth, that turmoile in the clowds. And again, many others have otherwise determined of it. So that we may justly say, touching this point, and that rightly: <hi>Quot ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, tot sententiae.</hi> And now concerning the Opinion of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> it is in it self so contrary and contradictory unto the authority of the true Wisdome, that some of his learned Christian Disciples, have in the plain field of the Peripateticall Combat against the Truth turned tayl (as the comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then, for that if the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy exhalation, which is light and more apt to arise and penetrate, by reason of its subtility, be denied passage into the middle region of the aire, much more must this kind of exhalation have his passage barred or hindered into that cold place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is (as he confesseth) grosser, more terrestiall and apter to be inflamed: But this impossibility will also be demonstrated by the authority of holy Writ,<note place="margin">Apoc. 4.

would by the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles, with such a boldness, be ascribed unto God's essentiall power, and to be derived from his presence? Nay, had it not been an impudency in them to say, in regard of the divineness of the thing, that God is a consuming fire, as we finde it written both in the old and new Testament? or would the Prophet testifie, that <hi>he made his angels winds, and his ministers fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fires</hi>? How basely might a true speculator into the divine mysteries judge, of the beginning of the Angells and spirituall lights, if their materiall substance were accidentall exhalation? Again, we are taught, that the heaven or aire is the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure-house, from out whose bowells the winds, the clowds, the snow, the hail, and lightnings, and rainbow is extracted, and proportioned by the Spirit of God to do his will.

                        <hi>facit pluviae statuta &amp; viam fulgetro tonitruum: God by his wisdom doth proportionate the weight of the aire, and hangeth the clowds or waters in measure, maketh lawes unto the rain, and a way unto the lightnings of the thunders.</hi> So that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the matter of all meteors, be they watry or fiery, is hewen by the word or wisdom of God out of the catholick aire, &amp; consequently not out of the earth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any such need of the starrs attraction or elevation in the business, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pure matter of the lightnings is evermore in the divine puissance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in his secret treasure-house, to be called or chosen out at his will, who hath created all things to work how and which way he pleaseth; for were it not (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you) a wonderous thing, that at an instant so great a quantity of exhalations could be drawn out of the earth, and elevated by the stars, as did suddainly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for, rain down fire and brimstone on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi>? But our Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telians will say, according unto custom, that it was miraculous. I answer, that for all that, the meteor was materiall, for it was fire and brimstone. Now I would fain know of them, out of what magazine or store-house it came, and whether the stars drew it up from the earth, and whether God did not collect it immediately out of his own aiery or invisible treasury or store-house? For St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that all visible things were first of things that were not seen. Secondly, touching the agent, he is more deceived in it then in the matter; for first, he maketh the agent which draweth up the exhalation, the attractive vertue of the stars; then he surmiseth, that the efficient cause which enlighteneth it, must be partly the dashing together of two clowds, and partly the contrariety which is between the heat of the exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and coldness of the place, which meeting together, do cause the accension of the exhalation. Good God, what a Gallimofry he would make, and what a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of externall actions, or efficient causes doth he fain? when there is but onely one indeed, which is most internall or essentiall, that moveth which way it lift, and operateth all in all. Are these superficiall, accidentall, and externall formall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, the primary movers and animators of the bright lightnings? And yet it is said, that God doth animate and vivifie them with his presence. What can we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians imagine of the Aristotelian doctrine, when it would faign the immediate act of God in his prime angelicall creatures, to be so poor and mean, as are the adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious elevations of fumes by the starry creature, and the concussion of clowds happening by chance, and a conflict betwixt heat and cold? Verily it was no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, if when his invention did fail in the research of so high a mystery, he was put to such weak shifts, as in the eyes of wise men are scarce probable: For when we behold the admirable effects of the lightning, how it pierceth the scabbard without any hurt unto it, and melteth the sword, entereth the purse, and liquifieth the mony, nay, pierceth the barrell or hogshead, and drinketh or consumeth the wine, the vessell not altered; yea, and what is more, that it hath understanding and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to punish wicked contemners of this wondrous work of God, as having an angelicall reason to correct the presumptuous; We cannot but say of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that he is onely embued with the wisdom of this world, and not with that which is from God, seeing that he doth foolishly imagine, that the lightnings have not an internall principle, and most essentiall agent, which maketh them to work and move at will where they please, even as the winde is said, <hi>spirare ubi vult, to blow where it list.</hi> The lightnings, I say) are agitated and carried when they will, and have consequently a volunty, being that their internall and centrall agent is that eternall Spirit of wisdom, which, as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith <hi>est omnibus rebus mobilior &amp; sole atque stellis praestantior,</hi>

And therefore it was but foolishly done of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> to assigne unto the composition and animation of the lightnings, onely externall and adventitious efficient causes, and no internall and essentiall causes. But I will tell you two famous stories of certain cases, which happened in our time, to manifest unto you, that there is a divine volunty in the lightnings.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Ireland,</hi> there were two wenches which came from the market, whereof the one had bought her a pair of new shoes; these two travelling on foot homeward, and passing through a field not far from a wood, it chanced in the mean time that they were overtaken by a tempest of thunder and lightning; The one of the wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches seeing the thunder to approach, ran fast and called to the other wench, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten and shelter her self under the trees. But she laughed at her, lagged behind, and scorning, like a gallant, the thunder, said, Let the thunder kiss my back-side (clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping her buttock with her hand); so as it hurt not my new shoes, I care not. Which when she had uttered, the lightning struck off onely her posterior parts, and spared her shoes, which were not touched; and so the contemner of Gods wondrous and fearfull works died (according as she had said) miserably. Loe here, you Christian Peripateticks, and see, whether there be not an intellectuall mover, and divine vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunty, in the lightnings, clean of another nature than your master <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath taught you. There was also a young towardly schollar, a great follower of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and a disputer in the Schools, a man (as it should seem) more confident in <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s doctrine, than in the documents of holy Writ: This man being born at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> and having been commended for his industry and learning, was elected Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the free-School there. Upon a time he having been at the Act at <hi>Oxford,</hi> did return home-ward in the company of some Merchants, or other travellers, being on horse-back. It happened, that as they travelled over <hi>Salisbury</hi>-plain, a great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest of thunder and lightning did arise; and whereas the company which were with this schollar was very much dismaid, he encouraged them, bidding them not to fear; For, said he, it is nothing but a naturall thing, caused of a hot and dry exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which being drawn up by the Sun, and being included in the cold clowd, is there kindled, and so breaketh forth, and this is the cause of the noise you hear. Which when he had said, he onely of all the company was by the lightning struck dead, and some of the rest somewhat astonished. Loe here, the loss of a miserable man, through his so confident an observation of the Heathenish doctrine! For if he had rejected that kind of learning, which is founded on the terrene and diabolical wisdom, and hearkened unto the instruction of the true sapience, he would, in lieu of that profane speech, have worshipped him that speaks in thunder, and joyned with his companions in prayer, beseeching him to divert his wrath from them, and to hinder his fiery ministers from harming them, and then no doubt, both he and they had passed free from dammage: Then would he, by rejecting the forgery of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> have known the power of God, by these authorities of holy Writ: <hi>Nubes spargunt lumen suum quae cuncta lustrant per circuitum,</hi>

The clowds were kindled at the brightness of his face, coles of fire did flie, the Lord did thunder from heaven, and the most high did utter forth his voice, he sent forth his arrows, and the Lightning did disperse them.</hi> By all which it is made evident, that there is no es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall efficient cause which is naturall, but onely God in nature and beyond na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture operateth all in all. For in the precedent description it is not said, that the clowds or winds sent out coruscations, or that fire came from the Sun, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heavenly bodies, but smoke went out of the nostrills of JEHOVA, and fire out of his mouth; neither that vapours and Exhalations did gather clowds in the middle region of the aire, but JEHOVA bowed down the heavens or aire, and collected them at his pleasure; neither the coldnesse of the middle region did accumulate them into a dark mass or heap by condensation: But JEHOVA collected and gathered together by his privative and condensing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that dark chaos or confused abysse; neither was it any Angelicall efficient, but JEHOVA mounting upon the Cherubin, did animate it to move according to his pleasure. Nor was it the winds, that moved of themselves, but the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Cherubin being first animated by JEHOVA, did excite the winds to move: neither was that exceeding darknesse made for a secret Tabernacle unto JEHOVA, meerly by the act of the Angelicall wind: But JEHOVA moving on the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, incited the Cherubin to cause the winds to collect, and gather together the clowds; neither was it the resolutive faculty of the Sun, that melted the clowds into rain but JEHOVA that did sift or cribrate forth water or rain out of them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it the collision or dashing together of the clowds, or <hi>antiperistasis,</hi> which was between the hot exhalation and the coldness of the place, which caused the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Lightnings or inflammation of the clowds, but the brightnesse and inexplicable light of his presence did set the clowds on fire; neither was it the contentious strivings which was made between the fire and water, in the cleaving of the clowd, which maketh the fearfull sound from heaven, but it was JEHOVA that did thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from heaven; it was the most high (I say) that did utter his voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and sent forth his Lightning as arrows to destroy the wicked. Which being so, what have we Christians to do to look after any naturall efficient cause, with the acute eies of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which (forsooth) must act and operate <hi>per se</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, without any consideration; when by the precedent Text it appeareth that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was no liar, when he said that <hi>God operateth all in all.</hi> And as for that Peripateticall distinction of <hi>causa principalis</hi> and <hi>secundaria,</hi> or <hi>subal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna,</hi> you see here that it is utterly disannulled by the Text before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: For the onely efficient cause as well in the first, second, third, and fourth Organ or Instrument, was God: For it was he that inspired the Cherubin; it was he in and upon the Cherubin, which did animate the winds; it was he in and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cherubin by the winds, that gathered the clowds together; it was he that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57108:62"/>
in and upon the Cherubin, by the winds, did sift out water and rain out of the clowds, and did set them on fire, by sending forth Lightnings from his Throne. And, in conclusion, though he use many Organs, yet the essentiall act which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth in and by them all, doth issue forth from one simple and sincere identity, which comprehendeth no otherwise all things in himself, then unity in Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick is assuredly reckoned for the father of multitude. Thus we see that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said young-man was lost, by his too too much presuming on the vain and prestigious doctrine of his Peripateticall Master: For whereas he taught unto the honest Christians which were his Companions, the false doctrine of his Ethnick Master, in their greatest need, namely when the angry hand of the Almighty was in the heavens ready to menace them, if they called not out for grace, from him who spake out of the clowds in time, and did wish them to abolish all feare, making them believe that the Lightnings were contingent things in nature, and made as it were by hap-hazard, and not indued with sense or reason, as being framed and shaped out, yea, and informed by externall and superficiall Principles; he with his companions should have remembred that saying, so often repeated by the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Timor Domini est principium Sapientiae: The feare of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom.</hi> If then both he and they had acknowledged that it was God that spoke in Thunder, being environed about with his potent Angells, they would then not have been so careless, but have prayed unto him hartily, have utterly forgotten this absolute acting-nature of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> considering that God is the onely Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Nature of Natures. I could tell you of many other wonderfull stories to my knowledg, but I will onely insist upon these two. About some five or six yeares since, there was one <hi>Piper's</hi> daughter of <hi>Colebrook,</hi> who being a gleaning of Corn after the harvest was carryed, in the company of her mother, and another young woman newly married unto a Glover in <hi>Colebrook</hi> who had been my servant: and also there was another daughter of the said goodwife <hi>Piper.</hi> The tempest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached when they were in the field, the elder daughter who had been, by their report, very disobedient unto her Parents, and would fearfully curse her mother oft-times, seeing the Lightning to flash about her, cried out, Fy upon these Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, I cannot indure them, I will go home: and when she was wished by the company to call on God, shee would not; but they hastned unto an high Oke, which stood not far from a Park-pale, against the body whereof she placed her back, and laughing she said, she feared not now: For (said she) I am as safe as in my mother's parlor. The new married wife that had been my maid, leaned her elbow upon her knee, being also sat down, and the sister sat a little nearer the Park-pale, the mother stood under another tree hard by, and, in a dry ditch under the Oke, another wench did shelter her self: But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o for all their imaginary safety, they could not fly the wrath of God: For the Lightning fell on the very top of that Oke, and the bolt plowed or made a furrow all along down the Oke, continually without intermission, and came directly upon the eldest daughter, that thought her selfe so sure, and struck her stark dead; and took away, for a time, the use of the new married wive's arme, that leaned on her knee that was slain, the wench in the ditch was struck in an amazement as if she were dead, the sister that sat more near the pale saw a globe of fire as it did descend the tree, and found her self so hot as if she had been in a furnace, but had no other harm; the mother under the next tree, having her foot set out towards the tree, where her daughter sat, was struck lame on that foot; the new married wife was struck in such sort, that in a kind of distraction she ran up the lane, crying out still as she ran, Lord open thy holy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Lord open thy holy heavens: At last they were all convayed with the dead maid in a cart from the Village unto the Town of <hi>Colebrook,</hi> where the rest did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover within a few daies. I saw the place immediatly upon this, and spoke unto the new married wife, that was my servant, and had all these things confirmed unto me at her own house, where also her husband did relate unto me a wondrous case befell him in the interim: For being very carefull of his new married wife, he perceiving the Tempest, did put on his new cloak, and took his old under his arm, and so went out into the tempest to meet his wife, and as he went through a field, great flakes of fire passed by him, whose fore-parts were blont, &amp; their hinder-parts shaped like fire-drakes, and on the suddain, as if it were by a great gust of wind, they blow off his hat from his head; which when he followed and stooped to reach up, he found a piece of his new cloke which he wore, so artificially cut out, and in so neat a Triangular form, that he did admire at it; and there he shewed me

                           </gap>tle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>-Castle, there I was advertised of a strange mischance which happened by lightening and thunder, about five weeks before my comming thither, some three or four miles from the Castle. I would needs go see the place, and in the company of my worthy friends Mr. <hi>Finch,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Thomas Thornborow</hi>; I took a view of the place, which was under a tall and well-spread Elme, upon a little hill, where it was related by the inhabitants which dwelled close by it, that two yeomens sons of good wealth, passed along with a load of hay, drawn with four oxen and two horses, which one of their fathers servants did drive: The tempest of thunder over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking them, he drew up the hill, and placed his load and cattle under the Elme, and himself stooped under his load of hay, and the two youths got upon a bench or seat of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>urf made round about the tree: at last there came a fearfull stroke of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, at which the husband-man, who stooped under the cart, said, Good Lord, what a crack was that! At which words, the boyes laught out aloud, and mocking of him, said, A crack! But immediately a noise was heard on the upper boughes of the tree, and a solid matter all on fire came down directly between the boyes, and struck the hair of one of them into the tree, and set the other so on fire, that the man under the cart, with others, were forced to run down the hill to fetch water to quench it; and when it was quenched, his skin was as hard as rosted pork. Thus they payed full dearly for their scoffs, and contempt of Gods judgments, when as indeed they ought to have prayed God, to have preserved them from the ministers of his wrath. It is a dangerous thing to sport with, and laugh at the Saints. There is the thunderer from above, who hath messengers, able to revenge his cause, if he but nod unto them, in the twinckling of an eye.</p>
                     <p>I know that some Peripateti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>k will reply, that it is but metaphorically meant, when Scriptures say, that God speaketh in thunder, and not really to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood as it is spoken; which if it were true, then is the plainest phrase in Scripture to be so also understood, namely, clowds, snow, hail, &amp;c. so that either it was a reall speech, or not reall; and if not reall, it would rather draw me to errour than truth. But Scripture is full of this kinde of speech, and therefore the whole harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of holy Writ doth take and construe it for reall. Again, others do acknowledge the speech to be reall but, say they, where God speaketh in thunder, that act is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, and not naturall. To which I answer with the mouth of the patient <hi>Job,</hi> saying, <hi>Pro irrigatione fatigat Deus densam nubem, &amp; dispergit lucem nubis suae; God doth weary the thick clowds,</hi>

sheweth, that the matter of them is the aire.

                     <p>To the last clause of his definition, wherein he seemeth to aver, that the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings move downward, because the stuff of it is of a terrestriall compacted nature. I answer, that this reason is over weak, considering the Gigantean author that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it; for it may in the self-same manner be inferred, that the Gun-powder, which is of a far grosser stuff then is that of the lightnings, must therefore strike downwards; and yet we see by experience, it riseth in spight of a mean resistance, by its naturall inclination upward, as we may perceive by places that are undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and squibs, which are violently carried upward. I come therefore unto such true definitions of lightning and thunder, as are maintained and allowed by the Book of Verity.</p>

                     <p>SInce therefore it hath been made manifest in the precedent Chapter, that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> hath utterly erred in his conceit, touching as well the materiall, as essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and formall cause of the lightnings, let me gather, as near as my weak capacity will give me leave, what should be the true nature, and originall essentiall cause of the lightnings, according unto the harmonicall consent of holy Scriptures.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Lightning is a certain fiery aire or spirit, animated by the brightness of JEHOVA, and extracted out of his treasury, which is the heavens, or catholick aire, to do and execute his will, for the good or detriment of the creature.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Or else in this manner.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Lightning is a shining brightnesse, proceeding out of the clowds, being the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion of JEHOVA, and is sent from the throne of God, even down unto the earth, covering the surface of the seas.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>But if we would describe the lightning with all his accidents, and consequently expresse the whole essence of the thunder, which is a mixed nature, we may effect it thus, out of the testimony of the holy Bible.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Lightning is a fire burning from the face or presence of JEHOVA, at the sight or contact of whose brightnesse the clowds do pass away, and the Almighty doth thunder and utter his voice from heaven, and sendeth forth his arrowes for the destruction of the wicked.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Or thus.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Lightning is a fire proceeding from JEHOVA, being sent out of his dark taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle from above, at the sight whereof, the waters or clowds, as being terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the abysse as it were troubled, do haste away; in which turmoil, the voice of his thunder moveth circularly, and the fiery or kindled coals are sent forth, as arrowes sent out from a well bent bow, to effect his will, as well for benediction, as for vengeance, both in heaven and earth.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Or in this sort.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Lightning or coruscation is a clear and pure light in the clowds above, the which the winde that passeth by doth purifie, &amp;c.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>By the first of these descriptions, the manifest materiall cause of the lightning is expressed to be a fiery aire; the place out of which it is drawn is the treasure-house of God, or the heavens. Also the formall cause is expressed, in that it is set down to be a fiery spirit or aire; the efficient cause (I said) according unto the truths testimony, to be the will or word of God, on which dependeth that spirit of wisdom, by which God operateth all things. Lastly, the finall cause is also noted, forasmuch as it is said, That it was created to do the will of him that ordained it, either for the pain or pleasure of mortall men. All which is evidently confirmed out of the places of Scripture mentioned before.</p>

                     <p>The members of the third description (out of the which also the whole nature of the Thunders is enucleated) are confirmed by the page of verity. For first, the materiall cause of the Thunder is pointed out in these words: That it is a burning fire or fiery aire: also in the description of it, his formall cause is selected: the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause is noted to be JEHOVA in his wrath; the immediate effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the exagitation of the clowds, and the lowd noise or voice of the thunders. Lastly, it concludeth, that the end or finall cause, is to exercise God's vengeance on the wicked.</p>
                     <p>The fourth and fifth description, in this: <hi>Jam non respiciunt homines lucem, cum nitida est in superioribus nub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As for the Thunder, I gather out of the Holy Scriptures; that it is to be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thus;</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>The Thunder is a noise, which is made in the clowdy tent or pavillion of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVA, over the which extending the beams of his Light, he covereth the <hi>superficies</hi> of the Sea, and illuminateth the earth, that thereby he may judge the people thereof, and give them meat abundantly.</p>

                     <p>To conclude, it is most apparent by this which is already said, that the opinion of the Peripateticks, as well Christian as Ethnick, is most inconsiderate and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, in averring, that the lightnings are hot and dry exhalations, extracted out of the earth, and elevated on high, even unto the middle region of the aire, by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive vertue of the Sun, and that they being included into a clowd, and kindled, partly by the collision or knocking together of other clowds, and partly by the coldness of the place, do by the eruption of their flames cause the thunders. I would have every wise Christian to observe duely, by what hath already been said, whether the mystery of a tempest and whirl-wind do consist and stand upon a thing of so small moment, and poor esteem, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> would make us believe; or if it arise not out of a far more profound and inscrutable abysse or profundity, seeing that the lightnings are reported by truth it self, to be such fiery lights of God, as issue or proceed from his throne, and the thunders are justly termed, the voice, word, and eloquence of JEHOVA. And for this reason, JEHOVA reprehending the boldness of these kind of worldly Philosophers which presume so far to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure his inscrutable actions, or to dive into the depth of his mysteries, touching the essentiall causes of these meteors, without the warrant and assistance of Gods Spirit, and falsly to make the world believe, that his hidden and abstruse secrets are effected after their vain imaginations, (which vanish in the conclusion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as nothing, because indeed they are grounded on nothing else, but foolish and self-conceited phantasies and vanities) seemeth to utter unto them these spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: <hi>Auribus percipite, &amp; considerate mirabilia Dei fortis.

I would request you, as a true Christian ought unto his brethren, to observe well, and attend with diligence, this admonition which I will for a Farewell bestow upon you, beseeching you not to scorn or reject my prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent assertion, whith hath told and sufficiently proved unto you, that the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and thunders, yea, and all other meteors, are the immediate works of Gods hand, being that by this endeavour of mine, you may not onely bring a comfort and consolation unto your soules, when you hear the terrible voice of the Lord, and make you to call to mind your passed sins and iniquities, and to pray him hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to pardon you,<note place="margin">Job 37.</note> and not to call your offences unto an account in his anger; but also give the honour and glory unto him, who thundering from above, worketh marvellously.</p>
                     <p>I would have you therefore to know, that the worldly wise-men of this our Christian world, who are, as it were, pages or followers of the Ethnick Philosophers, have hitherto blindly, or after the manner of lunatick persons, erred in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, forasmuch as they being instructed in the blind wisdom of this world, by their Ethnick tutors and doctors, will not be brought to believe, that God doth work immediately all things in heaven and in earth, onely by his word; but mediately, namely, by other necessary natural or supernatural means, as essential effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient causes; when as the holy Text doth in plain terms instruct us, that it is one &amp; the self-same essence, which doth act and operate all in all by his word, using each creature onely as his organ or instrument, wherein and by the which he moveth, and worketh his will. Is not this their tenet or assertion (I beseech you) altogether opposite and contradictory unto the divine authority, which saith, <hi>Though there be that are called gods,</hi>

But every man hath not that knowledge, &amp;c?</hi> Out of which words we may gather, that though we worldlings attribute this or that work unto angels, or stars, or winds, or a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated nature, according unto the doctrine of the Ethnick wisdom; yet such true

All which, although unto reall Christians it seemeth verity and truth, yet unto the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and wise men of this world, this kind of doctrine, issuing from the heavenly wisdom, is rejected and derided; And why? Forsooth because (as the Text doth teach us) <hi>every man hath not this knowledge</hi>; and the reason is, because they respect more the wisdom of this world, which is terrene and animal, and, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, meer foolishness before God, then that which is from above, namely, from the Father of light, <hi>Et sic evanuerunt in imaginationibus suis, And so they did vanish in their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> I heartily wish you therefore, which are brought up and made familiar in the holy Bible, and nourished spiritually, and guided by the law of our Lord Jesus Christ, to conceive seriously, and perpetually to revolve with your selves, that God created the first consistence of things, namely, the humid and fluid waters, by his word, and they remain in the word, and by the word, in the self-same humid or moist estate as they did, even unto this very day. Also he framed out of this catholick water the heaven and the earth by his word, (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith). Again, he did produce by his said word the light in heaven,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> the Sun, the Moon, the Starrs, the day, the night, and all other creatures, and did ordain them to serve for divers Organs, by the which he might variously act or operate his volunty, as well in heaven above, as in the earth and waters beneath. All which do move and work in and by the Word. And, in conclusion, God by his Word doth exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly and soly operate all in all, as the Apostle saith: which being so, I would fain know where is this Physicall nature of the Peripateticks, unto the which they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign an essential form of action of it self and by it self? Verily, it is most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that there is no such catholick actor,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. Ephes. Wisd. 1.

                     <head>The Argument of the First Book.</head>
                     <p>AFter that the Author had by diligent enquiry understood, that all Sympathy and Antipathy did spring immediately from certain different passions of the Soul, or vivifying Spirit, whereof the one is Concupiscible, and the other is Irascible; and yet perceived them by effect to be in Creatures, as well Vegetable and Minerall, as Animal; he was surprised with an especiall desire, to find out the radicall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or beginning thereof. And when he had well pondered and considered that eternall Unity, (which is the head and root of all things) in its simple and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute nature, he could discern no such diversity in its essence, seeing that it existeth for evermore, but onely one and the same Identity. For, according unto holy Writ, <hi>Sicut tenebrae ejus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Psal. 138.11.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>ita &amp; lux ejus; As his darknesse, so is his light.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gathered, that a two-fold aeviall effect or principle, clean opposite unto one another in condition and disposition, must needs spring and arise from these two severall properties, in that one entire essence; namely, Nolunty and Volunty, whereof the first was expressed by darknesse, and the other by light: For when this mentall Eternity, and infinite Light, in whom in verity there is no darknesse, wills not, it reserveth it self within it self, that is, it reflecteth his beams into it self, and so informeth nothing by his presence, but leaveth the universall Abysse or Chaos (which is said in this estate to dwell and exist in the divine puissance) dark, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, quite void, and destitute of its vivifying act, or resplendent brightnesse; and this his negative action is the perfect character of his Nolunty, the generall effects whereof are darknesse and privation. But when this abstruse unity doth send out the benigne and salutary brightnesse of its essence, (which is the expression of his Volunty or will) into the deformed Chaos, then deformity, or darknesse and priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are forced to give place unto their opposite corrivalls, Conformity, or Light and Position, which are the affirmative acts of life and essentiall existence. By this object therefore of his contemplation, he did gather, that the act of Volunty, and that of Nolunty, were in one essentiall Unity, which was all goodnesse, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that Nolunty in it, is nothing else but its Volunty, being that as it is one and all, so also is its Volunty but one Identity in it, and yet all and over all with it, <hi>for thereby it acteth or worketh its pleasure,</hi>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57108:70"/>
all in it is good, forasmuch as if is onely and absolutely good indeed in it self. As for the contrary effects, namely, the deformed and privative darknesse of the rude chaos, or undigested abysse, and the informing act or positive emanation of light, they indeed appear such unto the creatures, and seem to produce unto this world an infinity of contrarieties, which are esteemed by mortals to be either good or evill, according as by effect they find them. Howsoever, it seemeth most apparent unto the Author, that these two contrary effluxions, or extensions, proceeding in effect from one essentiall eternity, were the principles of all things, being that the dark Chaos did afford and produce out of her womb the waters, <hi>which was the onely matter whereof the world,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>2 Pet. 3.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>and consequently the heavens and earth were made.</hi> And the vivifying emanation or irraciation of the eternall light, did bestow on it form, shape, vertue and motion. All which, when the Author had discovered, and seriously pondered with himself, his reason did clearly thereupon inform him, that the world was compacted and framed of contrary stuffe; for how is it possible, but that opposite and discordant parents, should bring forth children disagreeing in condition from their kind? And yet such was the will of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that these two dissonant accords should, in the beginning and shaping forth of an Image like unto himself, be united into one Unison or unity, by the inviolable tye of his never-dying Spirit of love and concord, that thereby the matter (which is the substance of the dark waters) might serve as a female unto the formall and masculine eradiation, or illuminating spirit, which issued from him, and so make of that duality, or confusion of unities, a typicall Trinity in Unity, figured after the similitude of the Archetype, which being meerly spirituall, was the eternall life and formall being of the world, (it self remaining without any beginning) and for that cause, the world being its image, must also have a catholick life or soul, by which it may act and live, according unto the pattern from whence, as well the form of its essence, as the matter of its existence, did flow, and must for that reason be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the opposite properties of willing and nilling, or Volunty and Nolunty, and, by consequence, of amiable attraction, or odible expulsion. Hereupon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did observe, that both the internall and externall type, or typicall world, must needs be subject to contrary passions and alterations, proceeding from the like properties, namely, being sometimes apt to incline unto the disposition of darknesse, following therein by a naturall instinct, the condition and inclination of matter or water, which was the offspring of the dark Abysse or Chaos, over which the divine puissance hath dominion; and therefore in this condition, it endueth the character of unitie's Nolunty, and sometimes affecting and imitating the action and property of light, which floweth from the eternall and all-acting fountain of unity. And this is the vertuous effect of the sacred Volunty. For it seemed unto the Author, that by reason that the whole world was composed of these two contrary properties, namely, of formall light, and the humid dark matter, it must needs follow, that the catholick soul, or generall vivifying spirit thereof, and consequently every particular essence, or formall existence, which is derived from that catholick soul, no otherwise than beams from the Sun, must be obnoxious, subject unto oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site passions and alterations. From hence therefore springeth that originall love or hatred, which is known to be between the good Angels, and the evill Spirits; from hence do issue all those assiduall mutations and alterations, which happen in the aetheriall &amp; sublunary heavens, namely, by reason of the cross variety of the starry influence. From hence proceed those oppositions, and contrary effects, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, or breathed forth from the winds: From hence are derived the discord and concord of the Elements, with the diversity of natures in the meteorologicall Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions: From hence do flow the multiplicity of affections, the opposition of dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, the passion of spirits; and, in a word, the sympathy and antipathy which is observed to be between all creatures, as well simple as compound, be they animal, vegetable, or mineral.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="tcp:57108:70"/>The Author therefore concludeth upon these grounds, that it is but just and reasonable, to consent unto the opinions of the two notable and famous Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and <hi>Empedocles,</hi> touching this point, whereof the first hath exposed it as an infallible Maxim, <hi>Quod omnia fiant per litem &amp; amiciti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am; That all things are made and composed of strife and friendship,</hi> that is to say, Of hatred and love. The last hath pronounced it for an oracle of truth, <hi>Quod ex quatuor elementis,</hi>

                        <hi>&amp; ex amicitia &amp; lite composita sit anima; That the soul is composed of four elements, and of peace or concord, and contention or discord,</hi> signifying thereby, that contrary disposition which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the watry spirit, and the bright mentall beam, in regard of their originall: For by <hi>litem,</hi> or strife, he argueth as well the spirituall contention as the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, in respect of that contrary puissance and hability, which is between the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall light and dark matter, both in regard of the body, in the act of corruption, when the soul would part from it; and in the antipatheticall or irascible passion, in respect of the soul, in which the spirit laboureth and suffereth unnaturally. In these opinions of the fore-said Philosophers, they seem not to vary from that of the son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> speaking thus; <hi>Gemina sunt omnia, quorum alterum est contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um alteri, nec quicquam factum est quod mancum sit: All things are of a double nature, the one of them contrary to the other, and yet there is nothing made which is defective.</hi>

                     <p>These two principles of all dimensions whatsoever, since that they in order, rank, and antiquity, do precede and excell all others, did the expert Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans invent, after the typicall imitation or image of the most internall, centrall, and abstruse point of Divinity, or divinest and brightest Unity, remaining in that very estate in which it stood before the creation of the world, namely, when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served it self within it self, and remained occult and hidden from all potentiall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which it was pleased afterward, by the revealing of it self, or emission of its vivifying light, to inact and make manifest for its abode in its simple and absolute nature of unity, without having any respect or consideration to things which it would create: So that in this manner of this Unitie's being and existence, it could

To conclude, as Light is the originall of life, position, act, motion, and, in a word, of the Volunty of God in his revealed Nature: so also is this primordiall darkness, the head and well-spring of death, privation, rest, or vacancy; and in brief, of the Divine essence's Nolunty.

                        </gap> separated, but onely one Unity, indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall in his essence: For it is an easy matter to consider, that every inferior thing doth issue from a superior; every corporall thing from a spirituall; every vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible thing from an invisible; every temporall thing, namely which hath both a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and an end, from a thing that is aeviall, that is to say, which hath a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning but no end; and every aeviall thing from an eternall thing, to wit, that which hath neither beginning nor end, and therefore that eternall point or brightest Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which hath no beginning, and consequently no end, is the fountain from the which all aeviall and temporall things do essentially proceed, no otherwise then all <hi>numbers do flow from Unity,</hi> and are comprehended in Unity: For how far so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the number doth extend it self, evermore it hath an unity to begin it, and an unity to conclude it, and in verity it hath nothing bendes an unity to create and compose it within. But for your better instruction, you may observe by a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent insight into the cossicall numbers, how the Divine and Centrally formall Unity doth comprehend all creatures, as well before they were made, as since their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its self: For we must note, that there is nothing in the world, but it is either a root, or a square, or a cube, or some other such like figure, which is framed and composed of these. The root doth represent the beginning of all cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall proportions or magnitudes: the Square doth decipher the simple and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all principiated figure, which is created or made by the multipli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ation of that root: the cube is composed through the augmenting of that square or principia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted shape in its root; so that we may discern that the whole cubick body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the square is conteined in the root, and in conclusion, is nothing else then the root multiplied in it self or from it self. But that my demonstrations may yet approach a little nearer unto our purpose, let us I pray you with diligence consider the nature and property of this Divine Monady or Unity, as it is in its simple and sincere existence, and then we shall find it, and that without any egression from his own punctuall or centrall profundity, to comprehend complicitly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it self the three foresaid cossicall Dimensions, and consequently all other things which it hath now by Creation explicitly made evident, in this typicall world, and that is proved easily by this Arithmeticall demonstration: For if we shall multiply an unity as a root, in it self, it will produce but it self, namely an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for a square, the which being again remultiplicated in its self, will bring forth a cube, which is all one with the root or square; to wit, a simple unity: Whereby it is evident, that though we have here three various branches, which seem to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in their formall progression, I mean a Root, a Square, and Cube, yet in the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall verity and reality, there is but this one Unity or Indentity, in the which all things remaine potentially, and that after a most abstruse manner.

Then Pimander said, I am that light, the mentall spirit, that is thy God, of a greater antiquity then is the humid nature, which did shine out of the dark shaddow: but the brightsome germe of the mentall spirit is the Son of God, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby it is evident, that by the mentall unity is meant the absolute divine Monady in it self, without any respect had unto creation. By the Divine Puissance, is understood the dark principle, beginning, or Chaos, out of the which light or the divine emanation did spring. At the issuing of Light,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57108:74"/>
the word was made manifest out of the dark and deformed Chaos; from which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the humid nature or the Abysse of waters did spring, or proceed into action by the creating emanation: this humid Mass was nourished and vivified by the word, and framed in the Elements, as is said before. And therefore it is apparent, that the darkness, the light, the word, the waters, and Elements were complicitly contained all in the mentall puissance and abstruce reservation of the sincere Identity of <hi>Pimander,</hi> or God in himself, before they were created. But I will yet pass a little further, and confirm all this more rationally and demonstratively, by the authority of Holy-Writ: <hi>Job</hi> saith: <hi>Revelat Deus fundamenta è tenebris, &amp; edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit in lucem umbram lethalem: God revealeth the foundations of the world out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and he discovereth or bringeth forth into light the deadly shadow,</hi> &amp;c. Where, by the foundations he understandeth the waters, which were secretly contained in the dark and misshapen abyss, of the which afterward the heavens, and the earth, and consequently the whole world was framed by the Word, according unto the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetypicall pattern: So that we here perceive, that two principles of a clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary nature, do issue or proceed from, and out of one and the same Identity or Unity in Essence, namely a deadly darkness, and as it were the shadow of death, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable vivifying light, whereof the one was the matrix or receptacle of form: And the deformed bowells of the other, contained that matter without form, whereof afterward the world was framed, and therefore the wiseman saith: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus omnipotentis mundum ex informi materia effecit: The hand of the Almighty hath made the world of a matter without form.</hi> And according unto this tenent also, <hi>Job</hi> in an other place: <hi>Aquilonem extendit Deus super inane &amp; vacuum, &amp; suspendit ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram super nihilum:</hi>

                        <p>How that amiable and bright emanation of vivifying Love, shone forth from the Fountain of all goodness, and displaced Litigious and odious darknesse from the Throne of the obscure Chaos or dark Abysse: that thereby a World might be made of nothing that was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and beautified by the formall presence thereof.</p>

                     <p>IT is a wondrous thing, and passing all humane understanding, that out of one Unity in essence and nature, two branches of such an opposite nature should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise and sprout forth, as are Darknesse (which is the seat of error, deformity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, privation, or death) and Light, which is the vehicle of truth, beauty, love, position, and life. It is not for nought, that the Sect of the <hi>Manichaeans</hi> did
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57108:74"/>
so stifly hold that there were two coeternall principles; whereof they made one to be God whom they termed the Prince of Light, and the beginner and Author of life, health, and all goodnesse: the other they attributed unto the Devill, whom thy entitled the Prince of Darknesse, and the originall and principle of oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, death, sicknesse, and all evill. And they esteemed the Devill or Prince of Darkness therefore coeternall in being with God, because there can be no goodnesse which hath not relation unto his contrary, namely badnesse: For this reason they will have, forsooth, the God of evill and naughtinesse, to be of a coeternall existence with the God of goodnesse. By which means they would not onely exclude the Devill out of the list of creatures, but also banish Unity out of the bounds of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and justle Diady or duality (which in verity is nothing else but a confusion of Unities) in its place. And verily this point did seem so ticklish and diffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ult to be scanned and resolved, that there were some of the wiser sort of Poeticall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers that did incline unto their part, as it appeareth by such mysticall and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall expressions as they did aenigmatically rowl up or bewrap in their fabulous discourses. Amongst the rest, we find that the Poet <hi>Pronapis</hi> in his <hi>Pro o-cosmus,</hi> averreth that <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> (by which is meant the greatest of the Gods) was gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or incircled about with Eternity and Chaos. And that on a time whilst he was in his majesty, he did perceive a great tumult and troublesome motion to be stirred up in the bowells of the Chaos: Whereupon to help her in this her travels and ease her of her trouble, he put forth his hand, and performing the office of a Midwife, did suddenly deliver her of the foul and deformed Monster <hi>Litigium,</hi> or strife, the which after such time as it had moved great storms and troubles, and had ambitiously attempted to sore or fly upward, was forthwith by <hi>Demogorgon</hi> cast down into the deep. But when he yet perceived her to travell and be oppressed miserably with fervent sighs and dropping sweats, <hi>Demogorgon</hi> would not in these her agonies remove his hand from her, untill she was delivered of <hi>Pan,</hi> with his three Sisters, which were called the <hi>Parcae</hi> or Des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>inyes, and when <hi>Demogorgon</hi> was much affected and taken with the beauty and excellent form of <hi>Pan,</hi> he made him the Ruler of all his familiar businesses in the world, and commanded his three Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as his Hand-maids and Ministers, to obey his behests and will. It followeth, that Chaos being over burthened and oppressed, with the weight of so great a heap or Mass as she travelled with, and now being delivered and freed from it, did, at the perswasion of <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> place her Son <hi>Pan</hi> upon her Throne. This is the Parabolicall fable of <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> and Chaos, familiarly told by the Poets. Their Allegory importeth, that the generation and procreation of all things, did spring from the highest God or Creator, which they signify by the name of <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> unto whom Eternity is joyned, by an inviolable link in one essentiall society, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that he onely is truly to be called Eternall, who is, and ever was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or primary cause of all things. And they fain also that Chaos made a third in that endlesse Society: forasmuch as she is, by <hi>Ovid</hi>'s relation, the common mixed and confused matter or stuff of all things in the world, and therefore the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did affirm her to be eternall with God, as being a rude Mass or dark abysse, out of which <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> as an universall Father and Work-master, did according unto his will procreate and fashion out all things, and therfore they esteem this catholick Substance or matter of all things, to be the generall Mother, on which, and out of which, the universall Father did beget and frame out every thing; for the which cause they concluded, that there were two generall Parents of things, from endless antiquity; whereof the one was the Father and the other the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But they consented that God was their chiefest cause, and they would have the Chaos serve onely as his passive companion to engender on. And although it may appear, that the wise and divine <hi>Plato</hi> doth seem in some sort to verify that the Chaos was God's companion from all antiquity; yet he doth intimate to us well, as many other of the like profundity; that though she be termed a companion with God in the Creation, yet did she issue from him by a certain eternall generation or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, and that God did afterward frame all things out of Chaos: For which cause they conclude, that it did spring from God and is never divided from him; as also it serveth God as a female companion, for procreation and generation, no otherwise then <hi>Eve,</hi> being framed out of <hi>Adam,</hi> was called a companion unto <hi>Adam.</hi> This is the opinion of both the Heathen Philosophers and mysticall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balists. But to proceed in this Allegorie's exposition. The hand of <hi>Demogorgon</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth the Divine Puissance. The first-born of Chaos, namely <hi>Litigium,</hi> with a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57108:75"/>
foul shape, signifieth the true Prince of Darkness, the Author of opposition, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of discord; and therefore for his presumptuous attempt, against the Prince of Light, and the Lord of Life, he was cast down into the abysse. By the Second birth of Chaos, namely <hi>Pan,</hi> they point at the universall nature of the world, and the peaceablenesse and accord of contrary Elements, arguing thereby, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that great discord which was in the first opening of Chaos her womb, concord did follow in the second place, which was as beautifull and acceptable unto God in the later birth, as deformed discord was foul and odious in his sight in the first. Thus you see how in the first beginning of the world, all the Elements were at strife in the bowels of the Chaos: The three <hi>Parcae</hi> or Sisters of Destiny, <hi>Clotho, Lachesis,</hi> and <hi>Atropos,</hi> which were born with <hi>Pan,</hi> do signify the three orders of time, namely the time present, the time past, and the time to come. <hi>Clotho</hi> hath the care of the present time, and her office is to twist the thread of life: <hi>Lachesis</hi> is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendrix of the time to come, and looketh to the flax or hemp which is not yet spunne nor twisted: And <hi>Atropos</hi> doth import the time past, which is irrevocable, and therefore she doth finish and cut off the thread now spun. I infer upon this parabolicall relation, that though the Chaos or dark abysse be with God before the world's creation, yet did the infinite and sole eternall Unity or radicall Essence create it, and produce it out of its self: For that Eternall Unity saith: <hi>Ego Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus &amp; non est alter,</hi>

                     <p>It is evident therefore, that out of one and the same radicall Unity, existing before all antiquity, both the matter and form of all things do proceed, and that they appear in regard of their being or births but aeviall, that is, having a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning but no end, though in their essentiall Root, they are Eternall in God, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse Monady or Unity of all things: So that as the dark Chaos, and the bright informing Spirit, are two principles opposite and contrary to one another, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and property, (for from the dark principle, discord, evill, cold, congelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rest, death, privation, negation or Nolunty, do proceed; but from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is the type of beauty, and grace, namely the bright beginning, light, concord, goodness, heat, resolution, motion, life, and position, or Volunty, are poured out into the nature of the world, to cause it to exist and live:) so also both these are but main branches, arising from one and the same essentiall Unity, which when they cannnot pass or exceed the limits of their infinite fountain, are in him light and darkness, and no way differing in essence from their Root, which is all in all,<note place="margin">Psal. 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In these two actions, we may observe but onely one effect wich is laudable, in this one simple and absolute unity unto the petitioner; for though I grant, by the friendly and pitifull emanation or emission of my mentall beam, so that it is according unto the petitioners wish; or though I deny his demand, contrary unto his desire, and so it appeareth to be a great evill or mischief unto the demander; yet unto my mentall spirit, both the affirmation or negation appeareth good, and are founded upon good reason, and therefore are indeed but one thing, though they seem divers to the demander. In like manner, in the eternall and archetypicall mentall unity, whose type or similitude, the beam of our understanding is, as well the act of Volunty as Nolunty, is all one, and that is goodnesse; for he that is all goodnesse, hath in it self no contrariety, although in the creature, which is subject unto the effects, either of his privative or positive will; his privative or dark action is esteemed for evill, as contrariwise his positive and light emanation, that is full of love and benignity, is received for good, and therefore embraced with joy.

Thus have we confirmed, that the two members of an opposite condition or disposition do spring out of one eternall root, and that they operate in this world by clean contrary effects, and consequently, that since the mass of waters, whereof (as St <hi>Peter</hi> doth testifie) the heavens and the earth were made of old, did come out of the dark chaos,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> and was, as it were, her second birth, which the Poets feigne to be <hi>Pan,</hi> or the universall nature, it is easie to be considered by the wise Philosopher, that this passive portion of the world is by a naturall instinct inclined to darkness, and unto all the privative conditions thereof; so that if it were not for the formall portion of the world, which proceeded from that bright spirit of wisdom, (which <hi>Solomon</hi> calleth,<note place="margin">Sap. 7.24.</note>

                     <p>This therefore being well observed, we may by the detection of these two ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struce and mysticall principles, I mean, of Light and Darknesse, attain unto the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall knowledge and originall of the true sympathy and antipathy, being that it is evident, that the first proceedeth from that concording and vivifying love, which ariseth from the benigne emanation of the Creator, which desireth to be joyned with his like, and seeketh to preserve his like by union; and the other issueth from that discording, privative, and hatefull affection, which darknesse and deformity doth afford unto the children of light and life, and to all the beautious offsprings thereof. By this therefore it appeareth, that as before the separation of these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent properties, or effects of one unity, namely, of light from darknesse, which was brought to passe by the divine word, all things were one and the same without distinction and difference, and that unity or one was no way to be numbered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those things which were created, so that light was darknesse, and darknesse light, and neither of these discernable; nothing was really distinguished, but all were one in the first matter of all things, which was in the eternall unity: So that then there was neither light nor darkness, nor day nor night, nor heaven nor earth, nor spirit nor body, nor good nor evill, nor pure nor impure, nor generable nor corruptible, nor this nor that; and yet nevertheless all these, as well spirituall as corporall, proceeded from that potentiall subject, which remained complicitely in that infinite Unity, which both was, and is, and ever shall be, all in all, and over or without all. O admirable wisdom of God in all his works! All things (I say) proceeded from one matter, the which nevertheless was nothing of these things which were made. All things were abstrucely hidden and in secret, but, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto our Saviours words, nothing was so occult and obscure, but was to be revealed, and made to appear unto sighr, by the penetrating operation of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable word <hi>Fiat,</hi> by whose divine spagericall action or vertue, that one thing was divided into two contraries; upon the which, names, well befitting their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, were imposed; for the one, as I have told you, was called Light, and the other Darkness; the first also was tearmed Day, the last Night; and thus was the pure se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the impure. Hence therefore it commeth, that all the world was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally divided into two contrary Kingdoms, that correspond unto these two ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall branches of one unity, by the which relation it is easie to express, what in verity is light and darkness, what day and night, what goodness and what badness, what is heaven and what is hell, what is truth and what is falshood, what is humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and what is pride, what justice and what injustice, what is gladnesse and what is sorrow, what is sweet and what is bitter, what is action and what passion, what is life and what is death, what is generation and what corruption, what is pure, and what impure, what is wholsom and what pernicious, what is a medicine and what a poison, and, to conclude, what is amiable and what is odious, what is concord and what is discord, and, by consequence, what is sympathy and what antipathy, in an infinity of creatures in this world.</p>
                     <p>That the whole world, and every creature thereof, is composed of these two contrarieties, or opposite natures, we find it justified as well by the sacred autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as testimony of Ethnick Philosophy; for the son of <hi>Syrach</hi> saith, in the place before specified,<note place="margin">Ecclus. 42.</note>

should condemn me for making so long a discourse upon these two contrary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, proceeding from one Root, I thought it most fit to certifie each judicious person, that the true knowledg thereof is of an especiall importance, because that the two foresaid principles are observed to be the reall and onely foundation, both of universall Philosophy and Theology.

But it behoveth the zealous to refer all this unto the time when these secrets shall be discovered, which will come to pass, when the seventh Seal shall be opened: for then that high mystery, which is the finall cause, why and for what end Gods Providence will by these two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posits reveal it self, and clean extinguish all enmity out of the world, shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. As touching nevertheless the end of this dissonancy, the Apostle saith, that it will be, when the Son hath delivered the Kingdom unto God the Father, and when he hath evacuated every Principality and Potentate, and Virtue, he must raign untill he hath made his enemies his foot-stool, and the last enemy that shall be destroyed is Death. So that as two contrarieties or discords, proceeded from one Unity or unison, namely Light and Darkness from one Divine Essence; So also these two dissonant branches or confusion of Unities, will at the last be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or return again into one harmonious Unity, in which there will be found no dissonancy, namely when these words of the Revelation are accomplished: <hi>Ecce omnia nova facio:</hi>

And the Philosopher <hi>Democritus, Orpheus,</hi> with divers of the Pythagoreans, do not much differ from this opinion of these <hi>Rabbi's,</hi> but in variety of name onely: for they imagine that all things are full of gods, and therefore they offered divine Honours, Praiers, and Sacrifices unto them in the creatures, and did worship each of them with a divers fashion of ceremony.

But because there is not any bodily substance that is viod of a soul, and that the world and every part thereof doth consist of a body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore there is an intermediate spirit betwixt this soul and body, which they neither call a soul or a body, but a mean substance, participating of them both, to reduce both extreams together into one.</hi> The wiser sort of Alchymists, do make the Soul a certain infinite nature,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Arte chym. c.</hi> 4.</note> or power in all things, which doth procreate like things of their like: for this nature doth engender all things, yea, and multiplieth, and nourisheth, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staineth them: and they also style it, the <hi>Ligament,</hi> or <hi>bond of the elements,</hi> since by it they are fastned together with the Symphoniacal accords of peaceable harmony, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of themselves, that is in regard of their matter, they are dissonant. Also it is termed the true virtue, that mingleth and proportionateth every thing in this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary world, allotting unto each specifick creature a convenient and well agreeing form, that thereby one thing might be distinguished and made to vary from another: and, in conclusion, the mysticall <hi>Rabbies</hi> do averre, that this occult fire is that Spirit of the Lord, or fiery love, which when it moved upon the waters, did impart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, a certain harmonious and hidden fiery vertue, without whose lovely assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and favorable heat, nothing could be generated of them, or multiplied in them.</p>
                     <p>Thus you may discern the manifold opinions, as well of Christian as Heathen Philosophers touching this <hi>Anima mundi,</hi> or <hi>soul of the world,</hi> which will appear to vary little or nothing at all from the tenent of Holy Scripture in sense, but in words onely; Neither are these their opinions so hainous or abominable, as some more superstitiously zealous than truly understanding Christians of this our Age will make them, if they will scan the matter wisely and with moderation: for then they shall really perceive, that it doth concurre with the Bible of Truth: And to confirm what I now say; my purpose is in the first place, to expresse unto each learned and well minded Reader, the harmony of the Scriptures touching this point, and then I will compare every one of the foresaid opinions, with the sense and grounds of the said harmony, that each wise man may thereby the better conjecture and guesse at the truth of the business, before he shall rashly enter into the censuring of that deep and profound mystery, which concerneth the Divine action in naturall effects.</p>
                     <p>I told you, in my precedent discourse, that the Eternall Unity, which is the God of gods, and Beginning of beginnings, did cause by a double property in one essence, two divers principles to issue out of himself, whereof the one was potentiall, and no way as yet inacted by the brightnesse of his emanation, and in that respect is termed Darkness, privation, Nolunty, opposit to Light, and a friend unto death and rest: The other was actuall, and nothing else but a pure ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick form and brightness, which is tearmed Light, Position, Volunty, and in nature opposit to Darknesse, and a friend unto life and action, or motion. And then I signified unto you, that by the bright appearance of Eternity, or the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Spirit of Wisdom, (which I termed with the Scriptures, the radiant emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or effluxion from the Almighty, which is all one with him in essence) the deformed waters were inacted and made manifest, out of this dark Principle or Chaos, that is, reduced from <hi>Potentia Divina,</hi> or <hi>the Divine Puissance,</hi> without form, in which they abode, into <hi>Actum Divinum, the Divine Act:</hi> and because all the humid and passive catholick nature,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> of which both the heavens and the earth were framed, did issue from this Mass of watery matter, which the Poets call <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> or the second birth of Chaos, we must imagine it to be that spirituall matter of the world, which was made fertill and multiplicable, by reason of that hidden active and formall Light or invisible fire, which this increated emanation impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto it, immediatly before the creation of the heavens and the earth.

The earth and water did lie so intermingled together, that the face of the earth was no where overflowed or drowned by the waters.</hi> Whereby it is evidently proved, that this thin spirituall water, or humid nature, in it self is no more than mans spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the vivifying act of life; for as in the soul of every creature that liveth, there are two things chiefly to be required, namely, an Agent and a Patient; so where the one of these are wanting, there can be no created soul: for if that the world's life was onely the essentiall breath of God, without the vehicle of the created hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid spirit, which is the matter of heaven; then that life would be simple identity, and of one and the same property, and consequently there would be neither varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of action, neither any contraction or dilatation of systole and diastole in things, and therefore no action or passion in the soul; for without a passive nature there can be no action, and also without an active nature there can be no passion. Now matter which proceedeth from water is the subject of all passion, as here, mother <hi>Chaos</hi> was the female or passive, unto the action of <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> or God. Also act or form, which proceedeth from light, is the subject of all action, as its father Eternity, or the bright emanation of the spirit of wisdom from the fountain of light, was the male or agent. From hence therefore it is an easie thing to gather, first, what the soul of the world is, and therefore of what parts it doth consist; for we must consider, that as every creature hath his interior and exterior, so also we must exquisitely search after an internall and an externall, in the soul, being it is a creature; and again, that it is a creature, it is most certain, because it is not Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,

but Alterity; for if it were Identity, it would be the divine unity or essence, and consequently it would not be created.

So that the mighty question, so often revolved by the Peripatetick Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and so slenderly by them resolved, may hereby be fully determined, and enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleated, if it please the wise and impartiall Reader rightly to consider things, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they do stand; for by this, it is easie to express and distinguish <hi>mentem divinam,</hi> or the <hi>divine emanation,</hi> from <hi>anima,</hi> or the <hi>soul</hi>; and again, the <hi>anima</hi> from <hi>spiritus,</hi> or the <hi>spirit</hi>; being that it is evident, that the mentall radication, is the eternall and formall emanation, which is given or sent out by the Creator in her positive property, to create the world, and consequently the earthly body and heavenly spirit thereof, of nothing, or non-actuall existence. The spirit is that inward created spirit of the world, or subtle substance of the waters, or humid nature, simply considered in its self, which is animated and illuminated by that Archetypicall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manation; and the soul, or <hi>anima,</hi> is that union, which is made between this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid created spirit, and the increated formall emanation, which doth inform or create. So that by this we may discern, first, what the <hi>forma informans,</hi> or <hi>natura naturans,</hi> is; then what the <hi>forma informata,</hi> or the <hi>natura naturata</hi> is. The <hi>forma formans,</hi> or <hi>natura naturans</hi> is God, or the divine emanation, which created all things; the <hi>forma informata,</hi> or <hi>natura naturata</hi> is the created light, or the spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed or illuminated, by the presence of the bright increased Spirit; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created Spirit clothed with, or enduing that created spirit, is said to be <hi>vestitus,</hi> or <hi>amictus lumine quasi vestimento,</hi>

That the soul of the world, or <hi>Mens divina in mundo,</hi> simply taken, is the divine mentall emanation absolutely in it self, being distinguished from the created spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, this Text in Scriptures doth warrant: <hi>Animam &amp; Spiritum dividit &amp; discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit sermo Dei vivus: The Word of God doth devide the soul and the spirit,</hi> &amp;c.

Now if we shall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine all these delineations, of the essence and properties of this <hi>Anima,</hi> as well in her freedom from the body, as when it is included in it; we shall find it not to vary one jot from the tenor of my precedent assertion. For first, we shall observe it to be in its essentiall virtue, the off-spring of the eternall emanation, which came immediatly from God, for the inacting of all things, and then that it hath for its substantiall Vehicle, the thin subtile created spirit of the world, which maketh it <hi>alteritatem,</hi> or a composition of two, namely of the bright emanation from the eternall Fountain, and therefore in the foresaid definitions, it is tearmed in regard of this its interior, in the first, a Spirituall Substance, flowing from the divine Fountain: in the second <hi>mens divina</hi>; in the third, the Image of similitude of the divine Wisdome; in the fourth, a divine Light, after the Image of the Word, the substance of God whose character is the Word; in the fifth, the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Holy Trinity, coaequated unto the divine Glory. Secondly, it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates of the mundane spirit, and therefore it is by the sixth and seventh tearmed (in regard of its substance) a spirit that breatheth in the body, and it is the Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the formall act, which is in truth the divine mentall beam: being conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in it self, as the substantiall and materiall spirit, in its simple nature, it is that which participateth with the created spirit of the world. The union of these two, is called <hi>anima,</hi> so that <hi>anima</hi> includeth <hi>mentem</hi> and <hi>spiritum,</hi> or the divine and created nature in one, which filleth all, and animateth and vivifieth all things,

according to the assertion of such Gentile and Ethnick Philosophers, as I have ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, which I will prove no way to dissent or vary from the testimony of the holy Text. And to make this the plainer, I will compare them in order. And first, I will begin my relation, with the Cabalists great Angell, whom they call <hi>Mitaitron</hi>: which by interpretation, is <hi>Donum Dei, the Gift of God,</hi> which (as they say) is the catholick intellectuall Agent, from the which all peculiar forms do descend.

Thus you see that the Cabalist's <hi>Mitatiron</hi> or <hi>Donum Dei,</hi> whom they make the catholick intellectuall Agent, is nothing else but that universall Spirit of Wisdome which God sent out from this Throne (or as the Text hath it) even out of his own mouth, as the greatest gift and token of his benignity unto each world, and the members thereof: to reduce them from deformity, and non-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, into act and formall being, and to endue them with lively feature, and to tender life, and being unto them explicitly, which before was but complicitly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and comprehended, in the dark and gloomy shadow of death, I mean out of the deformed Chaos, into a beautifull shape; out of deadly sleep and dark rest,

And in the first place, it deciphereth the Symphoniacall Degrees of the Soul of the world, as shall be told hereafter: For first, after the example of the <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type</hi> from 1. issued 2. which is termed by the Pythagoreans, the confusion of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and therfore it is the radicall or incipient imperfect number, which is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his confusedness and imperfection in the same relation unto Unity, from whence it sprung, as the bright eternall Unity is unto the dark Chaos, which is, <hi>rudis indi gestaque moles, a rude or confused and indigested heap</hi>: And it is rightly tearmed Imperfect, because that the eternall emanation which is all perfection, had not as yet made it perfect: and for this reason also, the watery matter that issued out of it, is of it self imperfect, no otherwise then the number of 2. is esteemed in regard of that of 3. because all perfection consisteth of 3. tearmes, namely a beginning, a middle, and an end. So that if you take one of the Unities of 2. for the beginning, and another for the middle, then there wants an end. If you put an Unity for the beginning and an other for the end, then you have two extreams, but no mean or middle, and therefore it is this way also imperfect: Or if you place one Unity for a mean and the other for an end, here also you have imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, because there wants a beginning. In like manner, if Unity had not emitted his actuall emanatiom as a bright Unity of life, the 2. or deformed matter of the Chaos had stood in his duall, confused, or imperfect estate; that is, without the form, or shape of any perfect thing, I mean a plain <hi>Nihil</hi> or <hi>Aliquid in potentia &amp; non actu: Something in puissance and not in act.</hi> So that matter (I say) before it was informed by the Unity of Light (which maketh the third Unity) was <hi>Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um &amp; inane, Vacuity and inanity,</hi> because it wanted the presence of the informing Unity, or actuall emanation, to endue it with the title of goodnesse: for after the bright emanation was made, then vacuity was changed into plenitude; puissance into act; darkness into light; and a deformed matter, into well formed, and vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied waters, and, in a word, imperfection into perfection. And thereupon it was said, that God saw that it was good, that is, it was replenished with his virtuous Essence, who was all good and onely goodnesse. By this reason therefore, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the addition of the formall Unity, the manner of confusion and of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which is the materiall duality, that doth Symbolize with the Chaos, which is the mother of matter, perfection is brought into the world, which by anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the purest and subtiler waters, doth unite the mentall Light with the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, in an Angelicall essence, which doth afterwards animate and inform all things. And this formall Union is Symbolically expressed, by the figure 3. which for this cause is termed, the first number of perfection, and the number of the Soul or the radicall number of form in the course of nature: henceforth therefore it cometh, that the Platonists and Pythagoreans do expresse matter, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in it self, by eaven or imperfect numbers, and according as in the Achety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall world, defigned by 1, 2, 3. in form of the sacred Trinity, there appeareth to be three Ideall dimensions in one divine nature, or eternall essence, which present in their manner of progression a Root, a Square, and a Cube, which import a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream soul, a spirit and body of the world, Ideally painted out in the Archetype and that these three seem to be raised out of one 1. or Unity (for multiplying 1. by the root 1. doth produce 1. and its self which makes 2. or a simple Ideal square, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying it again by 1. there riseth but 2. and 1. which make 3. or a Cube, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth the perfection of the Ideal world, which was in God, if we take the two radical compounded numbers for roots, we shall produce after this pattern the created or exemplar world, namely we shall find out three dimensions; to wit, longitude, lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and profundity of the matter, by the inquiry or searching out of the Root, Square, and Cube of matter, the root of matter therefore was 2. for though the supream unity had multiplied or dilated it self in 2. arguing its first-born issue, yet because the holy Spirit of Illumination shined not forth, all was dark <hi>quoad nos</hi>: wherefore we must imagin, that the multiplication of matter in the world, is nothing but variety of penetration of formall light into the watery abysse, or materiall multitude: For the thicker matter is, the nearer she appeareth unto her root 2. or the dark Chaos. Again, the thinner it is made by the opulency of the formall emanation's bright presence, the nearer it appeareth unto the root of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Unity This mystery (I say) being rightly understood, all science even in the abstrusest Philosophy, may easily be decyphered. The root of matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which is 2. imports the dark Chaos, the root of form which is 3. imports that the root 2. or the dark waters, is animated by the formall or bright emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

And the formall square 9, being joyned with the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall square 4, doth animate the heavens, which by inspissation or multiplication are made corporall or cubicall; so that all bodies are made of those thin substances, by multiplying of each square in his root, whereupon the cubicall form wil be 27, and that of matter 8, which argue every elementated or compound matter: and as the more the matter is multiplied in it self, the darker and thicker will it be; so the more that light is multiplied in it, the lighter, thinner, and more spirituall will the creature be. Insomuch that the formall root, and square, and cube import the essence and souls of creatures, as well super-celestiall, as celestiall and elementall, which are more or less dignified with form; for according unto these multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in form, the more will the creatures be exalted in excellency. You see now how far, and by what proportions, as well spirituall as materiall, the Platonick harmony of the world extends it self, and may observe, that where this harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proportion between form and matter is not, there must needs be as well spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall as corporall dissention, or discord, and consequently antipathy. We see also, that the root of life is fixed in the angelicall composition, which is of simple, light, &amp; pure spiritual matter, so that the eternal sapience, or essential soul, is the act of the Angels; the aevial angelicall spirit is the act or essential life of the starrs, or heavenly influence; and the starry influence is the soul and life of the winds, the spirituall emanation from the winds do fourfoldly inform the catholick sublunary element, or lower waters; the element doth animate the meteorologicall impressions, and of these are the compound creatures compacted, which draw from the divine foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of them all, being one spirit in essence, but multiform in regard of the variety of organs, by which it worketh variously in the world. So that it appeareth, that God animated immediately the Emperiall heaven, or the intellectuall spirit, which is the seat of Angells, and this we compare to the root; the emperiall heaven ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the stars, or aethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Verily, not onely the abstruse Cabalists, but also the profoundest Philosophers, have made an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting memory of this perfect and formall root, or ternary number, with his triple dimension; I mean not that which is taken for a mercatory number, or such an one as the vulgar Arithmeticians do use in their Algorism, but as it is a spirituall and essentiall character of numeration, proceeding from a certain circular revolution and square, and cubick multiplication: And therefore the Learned have founded on this subject their formall and mysticall <hi>Arithmet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon this foundation also, the <hi>Rabbi Zoar</hi> said, That there are three things which correspond unto one another in this ternary dimension, forasmuch as they are framed or formed after the pattern of the Archetype, and radicall Idea, namely, the Tabernacle of God which <hi>Moses</hi> erected, the Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and mans Body, according unto the three manner of numbers which were applyed unto them, namely, the vocall or operative, which is the extract of the measure unto the elementary world; the formall, which is extract from the vocall unto the celestiall; and the rationall or divine, which is extracted out of the formall unto the intellectuall. I will make all this plain by the reall description of the Tabernacle: This Tabernacle did symbolize with the three worlds in his parts, for the former of them was uncovered, and was exposed unto the winde, rain, hail, snow, and all other impressions, which are ingendered in the sublunary world, with perpetuall alterations and changes; and unto this part, the common sort of people, as also the beasts, in an assiduall vicissitude of life and death, did resort, by reason of the continuall sacrifices which were slain and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this place. And therefore this region importing the cube of matter, is rightly referred unto the elementary world, which is composed of the grosser wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as of a substance fluid and unstable; and for this reason it is properly called, the world of darkness, wherefore the Evangelist in one place styleth the devill, the Prince of darknesse; and in another place, the Prince of this world. This region al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hath his relation unto the body of man.</p>
                     <p>The second part of the Tabernacle, which was burnished over with gold, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated with a Candlestick of seven lights, doth decypher out the starry heaven, and his seven erratick lights of Planets; and this heaven, as it is in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two extreams, namely, between the bright fountain of the formall or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall heaven, and the obscure and dark abysse of matter, or elementary world; so also it doth participate of the two extreams, namely, of water and fire: And for this reason the heaven is called of the Hebrewes <gap reason="foreign">

Thus we may see, first, why this region of the world is tearmed Heaven, or sphear of equality, namely, by reason of his mixtion in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall proportions, of form and matter; also, why it is called the sphear of the soul of the world, by reason that it is composed of the pure spirit of the waters, which is female and passive, and the bright fire or act of eternity; for the mentall divinity doth by and through this humid nature, which is his vehicle, act and shew forth his vivifying and emanating property, in and by this spirituall organ; and therefore doth all life consist, <hi>ex cali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The third part of the Tabernacle was the <hi>Sanctum sanctorum,</hi> and doth represent the super-celestiall, or intelligible soul, or emperiall spirit, forasmuch as his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57108:83"/>
is almost light and fire and it is thought to be the seat of the Angells, which are the ministers of their great Prince the Lord of light: And this is argued by the presence of the two Cherubins, or fiery Angells, which with their wings do sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow the propitiatory. This heaven hath his relation unto the intellect in man, which the Hebrews call <hi>Nessaniah,</hi> and the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Latins <hi>Mens,</hi> or the mentall beam, which hath the dominion in mans soul. So that we may discern, that in the great world, the angelicall heaven being most formall and fiery, is as it were the soul of the aetheriall heaven, for by it, and from it, this region receiveth his life's motion and being; as also by the like proportion the celestiall or aetheriall heaven is the soul or agent of the elementary region. For by means of the Sun, Moon, and Starrs, which dart down their beams and influences upon the earth, as arrowes against a butt, the earth, and water, and all things therein, do act, and live, and generate, and multiply; so that the heavens are esteemed by all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to be the Male, and the earth and other elements the Females, between the which, all generations are made in and upon the earth, and in the sea; for the earthly body cannot operate without a heavenly touch, yea, even man himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth for his generation the heavenly act and aid: and therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that <hi>sol &amp; homo generat hominem, the sun and man doth ingender a man.</hi> Again, all Philosophers in generall agree in this, namely, that <hi>superiora agunt in inferiora, more maris in foeminam; the superior bodies do operate upon the inferiors, as the man upon the woman.</hi> And the Maxim of all such Cabalists, as are conversant in the mysticall Theology,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reucl. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>De arte Cab.</hi>
                        </note> averr, that <hi>omnes res inferiores sunt representativae superiorum; &amp; sicut fit inferius, sic agitur superius; All inferiour things are representours or images of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours; and such as the inferiours are, such also are the superiours.</hi> And in verity, a notable person, and well seen in this abstruce learning, doth aver, that the aeviall or angelicall heaven, is framed after the pattern of the eternall and ideall world, and the temporall elementary heaven or region, is the image of the celestiall or aetheriall; so that the images and the actions of the darker world, have their ideall shapes in and from the lighter and starry world; and the starry world's shapes and actions were first delineated in the intellectuall or angelicall one, and they again proceed originally from the radicall pattern without beginning in the Archetype.</p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore, that both Theology and the mysticall Philosophy do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that God is well pleased with the holy ternary, which is the first odd num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Arithmeticall progression; for we Christians honour a Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in one Deity; and <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, That we are instructed by a naturall kind of instinct or habit, to honour God after the number of three; and he speaketh in this but reason, being that in the ideall world there was three properties extracted out of one unity, after whose example the reall world was afterward made; so that the Trinity in Divinity was the root of all the worlds formall composition. For by the root 3, the intellectuall or angelicall world was deciphered; by the square 9, the celestiall world; and by the cube 27, the elementary, as by the Platonick lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we may gather. But as for the Cabalisticall Rabbies, they consider the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative proportions of this Ternary after another manner; for as the cube of three consists of three 9, so they take these three 9, &amp; order them in this ternary position, 999, which makes nine hundred ninety and nine. So that after the rule of Algo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism, the first 9 towards the right hand is a simple digital number, which because of its simplicity, formality, and essentiality, is attributed by them unto the nine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Angells, which belong unto the intelligible world. The middle 9, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so many Tens, doth seem to partake one way of form or simplicity, and on the other hand of matter, and therefore they allot it unto the nine orbes or sphears of the starry heaven. The third 9, which is the place of Hundreds, importeth a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and more materiall composition, belonging unto the elementary world, all which do at the last terminate in Man, who is as it were a passage after the figure of unity from them unto celestiall things, and from thence unto intellectuall. To conclude, unity, in whom the Philosophers <hi>Leucippe</hi> did place the soveraign good and happinesse, being added unto the three novenaries, will make a compleat thousand, which is the cube often, and the end of all numbers, according to the Hebraick calculation. Also the square of 3, which is 9, by addition of <hi>Aleph,</hi> which is 1, produceth a Denary, or the number of 10, beyond the which, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> averreth, no man hath ever found any number. After the foresaid type there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or image, the antient Law did make a partition of the fruits and goods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the earth, ordaining the centenary number, as being more material and

But to return unto our purpose. The said Cabalists have adapted and fitted the name of their great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, which they take for the soul of the world, unto this very triple ternary, or formall proportion, namely, 999. arguing thereby his radicall, his square, and his cubicall extention, or emission of his divine form unto the profundity of matter, and consequently that he is <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This was therefore indeed the true catholick <hi>donum Dei,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wisd. 12.1.

And therefore in regard of the office, and as he was an emissive Spirit, so was he not unworthily named by them, the great or catholick Angell, had not Scriptures in plain tearms seemed to intimate so much.</p>
                     <p>I could also demonstrate, that the world, and his soul, or life, was shaped after the image of the Archetype in this manner: From 1, which was all light, in whom is no darknesse, did 2 issue, which was <hi>quoad nos,</hi> darknesse, or the dark Chaos, so called, because unity did not as yet shine forth to inform them. Betwixt these two extreams is 3 interposed, as a peaceable or charitable unity, between meer light and darknesse, or the Spirit of divine love, who resting in the midst between these two principles, uniteth the divine formall fire with the humid materiall nature, or spirit of darknesse, making a union of two opposite natures, so that both natures do remain in one sympatheticall concordance; and therefore this formall ternary is called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now where the intersection is made between the two principal concurrences, I have framed a piece of a circle, which circle, because the portions of the formall Pyramis, and materiall, are there equall, we therefore with the Platonists do call <hi>Sphaeram aequalitatis,</hi> or <hi>the Sphear of equality</hi>; or, as they in another respect tearm it, the orbe or sphear of the soul of the world, which is just in the midst of the star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heaven, called for that reason <hi>Aether, quasi igneus aer,</hi> a fiery aire, as who should say, an equall portion of the spirit of the waters, and of the formall fire descending from God or Unity, (as I have expressed before). And therefore as we placed in the precedent demonstration the 3 in the center or middle of the line, between the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine illuminating unity 1, and the dark Chaos, or deformed duality 2; so in the world was the spirituall body of the visible Sun of this typicall world placed, in which the invisible and increated Sun of the Archetypicall world did put his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle: and for this cause it is rightly tearmed of the Platonists, the sphear of the soul. And verily by effect we find, that all vivification doth potently spring from the solar or Sunny influence: and as for the excellent beauty of the creature, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in respect of the vivifying act thereof, it is an evident argument, that it aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with the blessed sparks or vivifying beams of divinity. Again, that it is the bright organ, by which he that vivifieth all things, doth impart and pour forth the showre of his benignity, or divine Nectar of life, continuall experience teacheth, even the meanest plowman. Now that this most excellent and perfect concord of life doth remain principally in the midst of the line, drawn from unity, or the fountain of form, to the earth or duality, which is the fountain of matter, I prove it thus by the accords of Musick: The perfectest consonance in Musick is <hi>Diapason,</hi> and of all the other symphoniacall accords, it approacheth nearest unto the sacred Unity in Divinity, for it is half unison, and therefore it is rightly compared unto the blessed emanation of life which came from unity; and for that reason it is
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57108:84"/>
rightly tearmed the Idea or image of a unison: And as the unison like one essence in Divinity, doth comprehend three Persons, importing the three accords in the Archetypicall harmony. So also the <hi>Diapason</hi> comprehendeth in it the two other accords besides it self, namely, <hi>Diapente,</hi> and <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>atessaron.</hi> Now that this most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect consonant of <hi>Diapason</hi> is planted in the midst of a unison, and doth, as it were, beget in it self two perfect chords, or <hi>Diapasons,</hi> which be contained within it self, I prove it thus: Take a Lute or Bandora, and strike any of the strings open, and then stop that same string exactly in the middle of it, and each half will sound a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apason</hi> unto that open unison; so that the unison which is made by the striking of the whole string open, will be divided into two <hi>Diapasons</hi> or most perfect conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants unto the whole; which is an evident argument, that the perfection of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apason</hi> is in the seat of the Sun, and consequently, that the formall and lively ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of all the world, is no otherwise in that centrall or middle place, then the heart, which is the seat of life, is in man: And yet by the beams of the Sun, this life of the world is made catholick, and filleth all, no otherwise than the vitall blood doth universally expanse it self in the Microcosm, by the channells of the arteries. But I fear I have followed this point too far, to prove and maintain the soul of this world; wherefore I leave it, to come directly unto the point, being that in my Mosaicall Philosophy, to wit, in the fourth book thereof, I have fully proved and maintained that Translation of <hi>Jerom</hi> to be right, namely, <hi>Posuit tabernaculum su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in sole, he put his tabernacle in the Sun.</hi> I will proceed therefore unto the second opinion of the Philosophers.</p>

Chaos, and therefore apt to move unto darknesse, by a naturall inclination; and of an increated active which seeketh to Deify this Spirit, if it do adhere or incline unto it, and to exalt its light.

                        <hi>But God is the beginning and the comprehension of all things.</hi> And again, he speaketh thus else where, in a generality: <hi>Deus est Cosmi Pater, cosmus vero eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, quae in Cosmo; &amp; cosmus quidem Dei filius, &amp; jure Cosmus appellatus est, quia omnia veritate generationis exornat, necnon indesinenti vitae operatione, perpetua necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis celeritate elementorum commistione ordine genitorum. Cosmus quaecunque ab ipsa origine suscepit, à Deo perpetuò servat: God is the Father of the world, the world is the father of them that are in the world, and the world is the off-spring of God, and it is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Cosmus, because it adorneth with verity every kind of generation, and also with a never ceasing operation of life, and a perpetuall celerity of necessity in the commixtion of the Elements, which by order are brought forth, &amp;c.</hi> In all this he varieth not from Scriptures: For that in the beginning, God is said to have made the world of a matter without a form, and to have adorned his humid nature or the heavens with his vivifying Spirit, which filleth and operateth all in all, (as I have told you before) and that from the breath of the self-same Spirit of life, all the creatures of the world are animated, and from the substantiall Elements in the world they receive their matter. So that as God by the pouring forth of his bright vivifying and all-acting Spirit, did make the humid and passive nature of the world to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and that so animated Spirit which is mixed, <hi>secundum totum &amp; in qualibet ejus parte, in all and every part,</hi> with his increated Animatour, is rightly called the Soul of all the Universe; So we ought to make no question at all, but that every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Soul in this vaulted machin of the world, doth depend and is procreated, preserved, and multiplied from that catholick Soul, because it is an axiom infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble among Philosophers, that the whole doth comprehend each part, and again, each particular hath his existence and being from the whole. But the world's ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick materiall Spirit is inacted and preserved by the catholick Eternall Spirit, sent out from the Fountain of life, to inact and vivify all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirit of life is indivisible in essence, and therefore as it doth actually from his immense fountain of life, send down or breathe forth the influences of life, after the manner of an infinity of beams, from one Sun, unto an infinite sort of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to inform them and make them live: So are those beams of life, thus sent out, no less continuated and indivisible, from that fountain or spiritual and indivisible Son of life, then the visible beams can be divided from the visible Sun: Neither was it sufficient for <hi>Adam</hi> to have indued a Microcosmicall body, namely a masse of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57108:85"/>
earth for his materiall, had not this exalted formall essence, sent by God into the world, as not divided from divinity, added a lively force and activity, by breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Spirit of life into him. And therefore <hi>Hermes</hi> spake not amiss, when he said that the world was the Image of God, and man the image of the world: being that as God created and vivifyed the watery Spirit of the world, by adding unto it his creating Spirit of life, so that Spirit of life (which is all one in essence with the Father) being sent into the world, and filling the Spirit of the world doth vivify, multiply, and preserve, not onely man, but also every other animal, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, and minerall, that is in the world. This being therefore in the first place to be considered, I proceed thus.</p>
                     <p>The variety of the Species upon the earth, did radically proceed from the very act of creation, when the word <hi>Fiat</hi> was spoken, and immediatly the will of the speaker was accomplished by his Son, which, by the way of emanation, was sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to do the will of his Father. And there are some that will not shrink to say, that all the Species or kinds of creatures, were expressed in and by the 22. Hebrew letters, not those externall ones which are vulgarly painted out with Ink or Art, which are but shadows; but the fiery formall and bright spirituall let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which were ingraven on the face or superficies of the dark hyles, by the fiery word of the eternall Speaker in the beginning, and therefore they are tearmed ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally <hi>Elementa quasi Hylementa,</hi> or Elements; as engraven in the forehead of the dark abysse or Hyle, and by reason of the essence of that divine Word, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the mystery of the Typicall creation, and did trace it out after the Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>typicall patern, and delineated it in characters of formall fire the language which was framed out of it was called <hi>Lingua Sancta, a language</hi> (I say) much spoken of by the learned <hi>Rabbies</hi> of our age, but little known or understood by them, and yet of an infinite importance, for the true enucleation as well of sacred My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, as of all true Cabalisticall abstrusities. But to proceed: According to the tenor of the divine Word, and his formall characters, the effects whereof pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unalterable into the world, each species or kind was framed; and again, every individuall of each kind was made divers, and distinct from others as well in shape and proportion, as condition and and property. Now, as I said, that this Spirit of the Lord did effect the will of his Father, in creating every thing thus different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being in it self but one and the same essence; So also did it, and doth still continue and keep every one of these Species or kinds by multiplication or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, in their successive estates, and preserveth every individuall, during the time of his being, as well by an elementary as aethereall kind of nutriment, which according to his spirituality doth descend, as it were from heaven, to nourish the spirits of each individuall, according unto his kind. For you must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that as the catholick soul of the world is generall unto all; So is the aire made the chest or closet of his golden treasury or spiritual food, which while it swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth occultly like a golden vapour, showred down from heaven in the aire, filling and replenishing all: So, whilst it is yet in the open aire, it is as apt to sustain and multiply the life of a serpent, a sheep, a fish, or a foul, an oake, a herb, or such like, as of a man: For so soon as the magnetick power or virtue of the creature, which causeth every minute a refection from this heavanly Nectar, hath drawn in a portion of this catholick Spirit or nature, it leaveth his catholick or generall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and worketh specifically; that is to say, according unto the individuall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that kind which receiveth it; that is to say, it converteth it self, being in a dog into his nature; in a whale into his nature; in a man into his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in an oake or myrtill into his; in wheat into the proper nature of wheat, and so in all other kinds, and consequently it is the cause that every creatures spirit is nourished and sustained it it self: For this was the Creator's Ordinance, that by what spirit the creature was first created in his kind, by the same it should be maintained, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and multiplied. Hence it was, that the Philosopher breaketh forth into this speech:<note place="margin">

I am the bread of life which descend from heaven.</hi> In this word therefore is life onely, and in no food else; and it is this in the aliment which nourisheth, and not the creature alone; for in the word onely was life. And for this reason it was said, <hi>Et vidit quod omnia quae creavit essent bona</hi>; that is to say, not <hi>vacua aut inania, void and empty</hi>; but full of Gods essentiall being, which is onely God; for it was he who by his presence made the creature good <hi>participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> or by participation. I will tell you what some of the Ethnick Philosophers say touching this point, who, in verity, (and the more is the pitty) had a greater insight into the divine mysteries of God in nature, then some of this our age, who entitle themselves Christians, and yet indeed are steril in the true grounds of a true Christian, being apter to judge and condemn the old Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and adiudge them for reprobates, and reserved (as they say) for damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that onely for not bearing the name of a Christian, then to observe the beam which is in their own eye, which maketh them so blind as to judge rashly of their brethren, when indeed the judgment concerning that point belongeth unto God onely: They forget the Apostles saying, which averreth, <hi>that all men are of Gods generation.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> But to the purpose. This is the reason that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher <hi>Zeno</hi> did call the vitall soul in a man, <hi>Ignem naturalem</hi>; and <hi>Prometheus</hi> tearmeth it, <hi>Ignem coelestem homines vita ditantem, The celestiall fire that enricheth man with life.</hi> And because this <hi>Prometheus did obtain the full possession of it,</hi> the Poets feign, that he is punished by <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s command, for stealing of this celestiall fire.

We infer by this which is already said, that the elementary aire is full of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of life, vegetation, and of the formall seeds of multiplication, forasmuch as it is a treasure-house, which aboundeth with divine beams, and heavenly gifts. Neither doth this our assertion onely touch the animal Kingdom of composition, but also that of the vegetables; for by this spirit they do vegetate, by this they do multiply into infinity, and, in conclusion, by this they exist and have their beeing: For in mine own ocular experience I am witnesse, and, if need be, I can quickly demonstrate, that in the vegetable is a pure volatil salt, which is nothing but the essentiall aire of the specifick, which is wheat or bread; this volatil salt is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous liquor, as white and clear as crystall; this is inwardly neverthelesse full of vegetating fire, by which the species is multiplied <hi>in infinitum</hi>: for it is a magneticall vertue, by which it draweth and sucketh abundantly his life from the aire, and sunne beams, which is the principal treasure-house of life, forasmuch as in it the eternall emanation of life did plant his Tabernacle, (as in the fourth Book of my Mosaicall Philosophy I have plainly demonstrated). I have seen this volatil salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter of this vegetable, being freed from his elementary bands, and being in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous nature in form of a liquor, I perceived him so desirous of the beams of life, which lurked in the aire, and were darted from the sun, that in the space of three houres, it became from a white crystaline colour unto a bloody ruby: whereby I was easily taught the reason of formall multiplication, as well in animals as in vegetables; for by this reason, a grain of Wheat is multiplyed unto a million. Again, no true Philosopher can be ignorant, that the salt-peter of every thing, which is but aire, by vertue of that mysticall spirit which dwelleth in it, doth attract aire as well as the celestiall form, unto it, being the form cannot be inspired but by the means of his airy vehicle; and by this very means also, the quantity of the airy substance, as well as the formall quality, is augmented, which maketh as well ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation as multiplication. By the strong magneticall attraction of the celestiall tincture, which hovereth in the aire, or volatil salt, which is of the substance and nature of blood in the animals, it is easie to know, how blood in the animals body is transmuted from a white chylous substance into a rubicund and ruddy blood. By reason of his vegetation and multiplication in substance, it is an easie matter to guesse the manner of augmentation and vegetation, and also of the quantitative multiplication, by way of generation, of the animal: For verily, I have observed so worthy an experiment in this vegetative salt in the Wheat, of which the blood of man by eating of bread is full, that we need not to make any doubt, but that it is the onely substance of vegetation, as well in the animall as vegetable: For on a day, when I had cast away the faeces, or superfluous part of the substauce, out of which I did draw the salt liquor, into a large Pipkin, and covered it with a thin plate of iron, within three weeks or a months space, I found it to have struck up out of the pot quite through the plate of iron, and to make above a thousand blades like an iron-coloured saffron to grow up out of the superficies of it, which argueth the admirable vegetative property that it hath in it. But letting this suffice to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the occult puissance of this secret fire of God in nature, in all vegetables, mineralls, and other animals, I will now convert the file of my speech onely unto that wondrous act and operation, which this admirable Spirit effecteth in the little world or man.</p>
                     <p>The spirit of life was by God so inspired into man, that he was made a living creature, no otherwise then when <hi>Elohim Ruach</hi> was breathed on the waters, they were animated and vivified, and became a great world, which the Platonists for that reason called, <hi>Magnum animal, A great living creature.</hi> But as the world was made after the image of God, before man was made, and afterwards man by the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the world, was framed by the Word, after the pattern of that Spirit of life, and the substance of the waters, which were in the great world. Therefore we must conceive, that man hath the vivifying means of his sustentation, preservation, and multiplication, by generation from the soul of the world, and his elements. Wherefore <hi>Hermes</hi> doth not unadvisedly expresse the descent and ingression of the worlds vivifying spirit into man,<note place="margin">

Again, after that nature hath received and drawn-in into her well-adorned, and subtilly adapted still-house or laboratory, I mean the heart, this aereal Spirit, with his concealed or occult treasure, she beginneth in it to anatomise, and sift or search the bowels of of this attracted aire; and separating the celestiall nature, or true vitall treasure, of the invisible fire of life, from the grosser and most inutil portion of the aire, it

reserveth onely the purest, which is nothing but a subtile volatile salt, adapted to serve as a vehicle for the divine fire of life, or true vivifying Spirit, in the aethere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and quintessentiall nature, and then, as for the selected Spirits of life, she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closeth them in her large arteriall store-house, called <hi>Aorta</hi> or <hi>Arteria magna, the great Artery,</hi> sending immediatly the more superfluous fuligions and inutil part of the aire back again the way it came, by exspiration. And this expulsive action is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the contraction of the transverse <hi>fibres</hi> of the heart, and the relaxation of the straight: for by this means, the heart is also contracted or compressed; which action of motion, is called by Physitians <hi>Systole.</hi> And we must understand, that for the better preservation of this golden treasure of life, within his arterial treasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>house God in nature hath so ordered, that there is a triple valve or gate like three half-moons, to close it in, and to keep it securely for the bodies necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, lest it should fly away by the passage it came in, and therefore this three-leaved gate is fashioned after such a manner, that it doth open within, and is closed without; so that what gets into the great Artery cannot return back again: as in like manner, at the mouth of the venal artery, there is a double gate compacted of two valves, and they do open without, and shut within; so that fresh aire may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter, but the treasure included, after the expulsion of the fuliginous vehicle or superfluous aire, may be retained.</p>
                     <p>Now will I'm few words, expresse unto you the action of this heavenly Spirit. After it is thus included in the arteriall trunk, it is certain, that it doth dilate it self, through the branches or divided channells thereof, over all the body: For by those branches called <hi>Charotides,</hi> a refined portion of it doth ascend unto the brain, by those smal conduicts; (I say) the super-celestiall part of this Chymicall extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, (forasmuch as it is in dignity the most super-excellent of all the fountain of life,) doth challenge unto his seat and possession, the noblest and loftiest region of this micro-cosmicall palace, and as it were his Emperiall heaven; for hither soar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the mentall beam in his rationall vehicle, electing this place for its chief ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle or <hi>coelum coelorum</hi> yet so, that the beames of his power, are reflected unto every branch of his divided <hi>Arterial</hi> cabinet: For this reason therefore, all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians as well Ethnick as Christian, have concluded, that the voluntary humane action, hath his seat in the brain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being the region of the animal virtue or faculty; whereas the other two actions of man, namely the vitall in the heart, and naturall in the liver, seem to be subject unto this, being that they are <hi>actiones involuntariae, unvoluntary actions,</hi> and this is the reason, that the Brain is the seat of reason and understanding. Then, in the second rank, that portion of the introducted Spirit, which in the forge of man's nature, is framed out and found fit for the action of life, is convayed into those branches of the great Artery, which are called <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicales, Humerariae,</hi> and those which assigne life unto the region of the Chest or breast, where it doth indue and take on it that impression of spirituall vivacity, which belongeth unto those parts; as also the <hi>Coronariae</hi> do assume unto them the internal or ideal shape of spirits belonging unto the heart, and so forward touching the other Arteriall branches, and their contained heavenly treasure: So that this invisible spirit lurking, and (as it were) swimming in the thin substance of the airy spirit, doth not onely expanse and dilate it self, to the vivifying of each mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the body, but also by a contraction of it self into a spermatick cloud, (the which happeneth in the act of copulation, through a certain magnetick virtue, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by divine love) this spirit is miraculously convayed into two preparing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall spermatick vessells, from every member, but especially from the three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalls: and there this celestiall Spirit full of divine fire, after the Image of the radicall Archetype, in whom all things were first spiritually and ideally delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before they were, in the regard of man (even as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> did glory in that he had wholly received the image of the Temple, described by the hand of God, which afterward was put in act) containeth the invisible of that humane body, which shortly was to be inacted, and really to be delineated, and brought forth unto man's sight; that is to say, it did ideally possesse the shape of the inward or spiritual man; as also the image of the externall or corporall man, being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of the four Elements, proceedeth from the visible sperm, which issued from the two venall spermatick vessells.

And the spirit entred into them, and hey lived again, &amp;c.</hi> By the which file of speech we may gather, first, That it was the divine vertue which fashioned out the externall man, before it had a living spirit; and then afterward, that the spirit of life was breathed into the externall man, from the catholick spirit of life in the great world; for he said, <hi>Come O spirit from the four winds.</hi> And again, that the world hath a catholick spirit, by which it liveth; for the four winds had their breath and life from this one spirit, by the which the universall sublunary element seemeth to live, and is changed from one complexion unto another, and doth most lively operate diversity of effects, in the compound creatures of this lower region of the world; for experience doth teach us, that the common aire is of an earthly nature when the North winds bloweth, and of a cholerick, when the East wind hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now touching the manner of the shaping out of the specifick individuall, it may be demanded, why this catholick vivifying spirit of the world, being but one, doth bring forth every fruit or birth according unto his kinde, and not all one. I told you before, that each specifick creature was radically created in his kinde, distinct and different from one another, according to the will of the Creator, and was by the same spirit maintained and multiplyed, evermore reserving the shape of the species or kinds which was allotted him in his creation; and it should seem, that God appointed, as it were, a certain secret mold to fashion out the potentiall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, before it came to act. And for the better understanding hereof, we must know, that there are four spermatick preparing vessells, namely, two and two on a side, whereof the one is a venall vessell, and it issueth out of the <hi>vena cava,</hi> and from hence commeth the bodily sperm, made of the refined subject of the four ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the body, and is therefore the principle or root of the Infants externall or body, and it is visible, and is called <hi>Sperma.</hi> And the other is an arteriall vessell, and this is the well-spring of the inward man, for it is the invisible fire of life, and it is called <hi>Semen,</hi> which when the mixtion of both is made, doth dwell no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise centrally in the visible sperm, then mans soul doth in the body. We must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve therefore, that as there are two vessells on a side, the one spirituall, the other elementall, so these two in their descent towards the resticles, do make by their subtle implication of the one with the other, that admirable and pleasant web or plex to behold, which the Greeks do call <hi>Ana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rs. By the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation therefore of the rules and axioms, as well of the holy Scriptures, as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Hebrew and Aegyptian Rabbies, he hath gathered, That the eternall or divine and archetypicall world, which hath neither beginning nor end, doth radically spring from one simple and catholick fountain of Light, and doth effuse a decuple emanation, endued with a ten-fold property, into the Aeviall or Angelicall world, which hath its beginning from the eternall one, but no end. And the aeviall world doth in like manner pour out these divine effluxions, or emanations of light, by angelicall vehicles, into the temporall world, which hath both a beginning and an end. So that the etheriall or celestiall region of the temperall world, is made the store house or treasury of the divine influences, from whence they are more or lesse, according unto the will of him who sendeth them out, distilled down into the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary

world, to effect his command or pleasure, either for the good or welfare, or harm and dammage, of the elementary creature. By this degradation therefore he perceived, that God sent out one essentiall emanation by his word, of a multiform and sundry condition, that things might vary and differ in this world from one another, and that the variety of properties in the manifold emanation, or flowing forth of the divine vertue, establisheth an angelicall creature, or spirituall organ, of a differing act, whereby and in the which it doth operate centrally, by a diverse nature. And consequently he finds it evident, that, being in the divine emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there are properties of a contrary fortitude, it must needs follow, that there are differing Angelicall spirits, which correspond in nature and condition unto each divine property, under which they do administer in this world; so that by these spirituall organs, or angelicall instruments, the beams and brightnesse of the eternall influence do descend, first, into the starry region of the temporall world, and afterwards are shoured down into the elementary sphears, and penetrate even into the bowells of the earth and dark abysse, to operate the will of that eternall and radicall essence which sent them forth; by which means, the spirit of sapience is rightly said to be in the heavens above, and in the abysse beneath, and to fill or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish all, and lastly to operate all in all. And lastly taketh into his consideration some special particular object, well known unto the world, that by the experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enquiry, or searching out of his hidden nature, he might practically maintain and ocularly prove that unto the incredulous world, concerning the mystery of Sympathy and Antipathy, which before he had onely expressed and verified The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orically, or by speculation. The Loadstone or minerall calamite therefore, is the mark at which he aimeth, or subject which he electeth for this purpose, being that the effects of its secret and occult properties, do most aptly correspond unto those of the animal, vegetable, and minerall. Wherefore he prepareth in this Book a way, by the anatomization and ripping up the fardell of this marvellous stone's oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult nature, that thereby he might with the better speed make his entry unto such experimentall conclusions and comparisons, between the one and the other, as shall be at large described and set forth in the third Book of this History, that thereby the nature and condition of the animal may be discovered, and demonstrated by that of the minerall. And lastly, for a conclusion unto this Book, he sheweth the folly of such persons, as being masked or overlaid with ignorance, do imagine, that any magneticall action can be effected essentially, by the devills artifice or power; averring confidently, that the devill is able to effect nothing, but by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall means, which also is rather ordained for the use of man, then of the devill; and consequently, that man which useth the naturall creatures, which the devill hath practised on to work wickednesse, is no way culpable of <hi>Cacomagy,</hi> as vain men would have it, being that the righteous use of the creature, for which God did ordain it, is not therefore to be rejected, because the devill with his adherents do unrighteously abuse them by converting them to mischief.</p>

As for example: All creatures that participate of those benigne emanations or beams, which are sent out from God, by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Organs into the orbe of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> are from thence emitted down to the earth, and are conferred upon a multitude of creatures, that were created under this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; which, for that reason, do shine forth and emit their beams unto one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here upon earth, lovingly and joyfully, namely because they proceed all from one root, which descendeth unto <hi>Jupiter</hi>: also such as are friends to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or like unto him in condition, send down influences in creatures, which are acceptable unto such as live, from their nativities, and are sustained and have their complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary faculties from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and therefore they send forth beams of friendship or benignity unto one another, as are also <hi>Venus,</hi> &amp;c. But contrariwise, where the influences which are adverse in property, or of an opposit divine emanation, are sent down unto the Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> which is enemy to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and from thence are poured out on creatures beneath, there will be ill and unwelcome encounters made between the secret emissions of those creatures beams: So that one by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall instinct doth seek to fly and escape the encounters of the other, or to resist and fight against the other, as shall more largely and plainly be expressed unto you hereafter. But because the generall cause of all Sympathy and Antipathy, is a hidden and secret emanation, or shining forth by emission of beams from one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto another, it will be most requisite for us, to unloose the fardle of this profound business, that we may the plainlier behold and contemplate the fountain and root of all beames and eradiations in generall, and thereby unfold and lay open the mysticall reason of their difference, and follow their extensions, even from the root, unto the trun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But all this is excellently expressed by the learned Cabalisticall Rabbies, in the description of their <hi>Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall</hi> or <hi>Sephiroticall</hi> Tree. You must therefore understand, that as the mysticall Theologians did observe but ten speciall names or attributes, which were ascribed unto God in the Hebrew Bible, <hi>a proprietate</hi>; so they did perceive, that each of these did import a diverse operation to be effected; so that the Hebrewes did call upon this or that Name of God, mentioned in the holy Text, according unto the nature of the severall necessity they had of Gods assistance. And though they col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the word of God, that as the Divinity or Godhead is but one internall immutable essence, and therefore hath but one onely essentiall title to be expressed by, namely, <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> or <hi>Jehova,</hi> which is his unseparable name, forasmuch as it is appropriated unto him onely, for it includeth (as <hi>Rabbi Moses</hi> the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath it) and argueth by a pure signification, the substance of the Creator, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect or participation that it hath unto the creature; yet neverthelesse they found, that the other names ascribed unto him in Scripture, do note or sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify God, as he participateth with his creatures, or as he hath relation unto things that are created, and consequently are known by the effect of his works. As touching his essentiall name, it was had amongst the Hebrewes or Jewes in that high esteem and reverence, that it was never uttered but in the Sanctuary, and that by such Priests, as were consecrated and made holy onely unto the Lord; and then it was pronounced in that Benediction which the High Priest uttered in the day of fasting. For this reason that name was had in that honourable regard, that it was never rashly spoken or uttered, because (as the said <hi>Rabbi Moses</hi> saith) <hi>denotat De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um esse &amp; fuisse super omnem essentiam quatenus, antequam ullares esset, existeret: I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The first name therefore of the Divine Attribute is <hi>Ehieh,</hi> and this Attribute importeth the fountain or originall of all creatures, and the foundation of miseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and clemency, because the effluxion or eradiation that springeth from this head, is full of grace, and spareth all; for it argueth the Father of pitty and miseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and the God of all consolation, unto whom our Saviour bids us pray in this form, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven, &amp;c.</hi> And hereupon it is else-where said, that <hi>the Father <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Could any thing exist which thou wouldst not have to be? or could it be preserved, if thou didst not send it the means of its being? But thou sparest all things because they are thine, O God, which art the lover of souls.</hi> Lo this is the fruit of the name <hi>Ehieh,</hi> namely, to create and beget all things as a Father, and to have a care of their preservation in his paternall affection. For this reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is the President of the Capitall or radicall bright port, gate, branch, or numeration, called <hi>Cheter</hi> or <hi>Corona,</hi> which is the root of the whole Tree, by which, and through which, the clear beams, or lucid and sacred emanation of JEHOVA, in his creating effability, or positive volunty, doth descend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the creation of all things. For <hi>Ehieh</hi> signifieth the father and root of all creation.</p>
                        <p>The second cognomination of JEHOVA in the divine numeration, or spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Tree, is <hi>IAH,</hi> which imports the blessed and gratious emanation of the world, and extraction of the humid or created nature, namely the waters out of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57108:92"/>
womb or bowells of the dark and deformed Chaos: and therefore the Cabalisticall port, by which these active and all-operating beams do descend into the world, is called <hi>Hochma</hi> in Hebrew, <hi>Sapientia</hi> in Latin, <hi>Wisdom</hi> in English. And <hi>Solomon,</hi> meaning of this Divine Emanation,<note place="margin">Prov. 8.</note> speaketh thus: <hi>When JEHOVA did frame and fashion the heavens, when he did establish the fountains of the Abyss, when he gave limits unto the Sea, and did appoint a foundation unto the Earth, I Wisdom was with him as a helper to compass all things.</hi> And we must note that this name <hi>Jah,</hi> whose influence or emanation is <hi>Sapientia</hi> or <hi>Wisdom,</hi> appeareth sometime to be conversant as well about the effects of severity, as clemency, although it happen but seldom. And therefore JEHOVA said of the Angell, which was appointed for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting of the <hi>Israelites</hi> through the Desart.<note place="margin">Exod. 25.</note> 
                           <hi>Ne exacerbes eum; quia non feret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionem vestram, quoniam nomen meum est in eo: Do not displease him; for he will not endure your defections or errours:</hi>

                           <hi>for my name is in him.</hi> Whereby it is evident, that this princely Angell, which is taken for this Emanation from <hi>Jah</hi> elsewhere, hath a double property; but his greatest inclination is to preserve the creature which it made.</p>
                        <p>The third cognomination is <hi>Elohim</hi>: and the bright port through which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting beames of his property do stream forth, is called in Hebrew <hi>Binah,</hi> in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>Prudentia,</hi> in English <hi>Prudency.</hi> And this name <hi>Elohim,</hi> according to the Cabalisticall interpretation, doth signifie fear, and terror, because they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that by this property or attribute of God,<note place="margin">

                           </note> there happeneth unto each world, punishments, and stratagems: for under this denomination JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VA doth exercise his power, as well for the sudden alteration of the world, as unto the punishment of the wicked. And therefore the Spirits which do receive this divine influence, are called <hi>Been Elohim</hi> the sons of <hi>Elohim,</hi> which are his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments in the Elementary world, for the effecting of his will in this property. By virtue whereof, also the commotions of the waters were made in the first cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and the production of them out of the dark Chaos: which was not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but by the extream contradiction and oppugnancy which happened between the fire and the water, and consequently not without the dreadfull dissention and warre of the Elements, causing terror and many thundering commotions in the dark abysse or deformed waters, when each word <hi>Fiat</hi> was divinely uttered: For it was by the Spagericall or high Chymicall virtue of the word, and working of the Spirit, that the separation of one region from another, and of the distinction of one formal virtue from another, was effected or made: of the which business the Psalmist meaneth where he saith:<note place="margin">Psal. 36.6.</note> 
                           <hi>By the Word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the Spirit from his mouth each virtue thereof.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ye may therefore perceive, that the whole power of the Cabalisticall Tree, is comprehended in these three first branches, no otherwise then the typicall world is comprehended in the Archetype, which consisteth in a triple property, most aptly referred unto the Trinity of Persons: For therein the intelligible world doth import, that which seaven doth in this materiall and watery world: For 2 is the root of Matter, as 3 is the root of Form. As therefore 1 is the formall root unto three, and the materiall root unto 2: So verily is 2 the materiall root unto 4; and therefore 4, which is the Symbole or character of matter, and 3, the figure of form, being added together, produce the universall substance of the world, consisting of form and matter: we must therefore with diligence observe, that those three first denominations, do belong unto these properties, whereby JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVA did create the three first daies work, wherein the whole world, with his heavens and elements were cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        <p>The seaven following branches of the Sephiroticall Tree, do appertain unto those various alterations or mutations, as well propitious as unfortunate, unto the creatures, which do befall them in this world, being thus compleated and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the virtuous properties of the three precedent emanations or streamings forth of the divine beames. Wherefore the fourth branch of this Tree, hath for his President the gentle and mercifull attribute of God or JEHOVA, called EL; whose bright port, numeration, or channell, by which it poureth forth its beames into the world, is for that cause styled <hi>Chesed</hi> in Hebrew, which in Latine is <hi>Clementia,</hi> in English <hi>Clemency,</hi> because the divine influence which shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth out of it is full of grace, benignity, life and goodness, as by the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it shall appear. For it is the fountain, from the which the good and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Planet <hi>Jupiter</hi> receiveth his benevolent Emanantion or beams of life: this
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57108:93"/>
name therefore <hi>Moses</hi> used, for the healing of <hi>Miriam,</hi> when she was made leprous for her disobedience, saying: <hi>El na rapha na la: Deus gratiae, quaeso sana illam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fifth name, which is assigned unto the first branch of the Cabalisticall Tree, is called <hi>Elohim Gibbor,</hi> and it is an attribute which sendeth malevolent and unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some influence down unto the creatures, making disturbances and troubles in the world, by Thunders, Lightnings, Comets, Warrs, Contentions, Anger, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, and hot diseases, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the celestiall magazine of this influence is the Planet <hi>Mars</hi>: for this reason therfore the port or channell, through which this fiery influx doth immediatly stream forth, is called in Hebrew <hi>Gehurah,</hi> which importeth power, force, violence.</p>
                        <p>The next branch or numeration being the sixth, hath for its Lord, the name <hi>Eloach,</hi> whose influxion or emanations are full of life and golden beauty, and therefore the trunck or port by which it passeth, is tearmed <hi>Tiphereth</hi> in Hebrew, which noteth, Grace, ornament, beauty, and delight. By the golden emanation which floweth from this channell, the visible Sun of this world receiveth his bright beauty, and is adorned with that admirable vivifying virtue, which by effect doth manifest and testifie it self unto the whole world. And this is that Grace and ornament of which <hi>Job</hi> meaneth, when he saith: <hi>Spiritu suo ornavit coelos: He adorneth the heavens with the beauty of his Spirit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The seventh divine cognomination or attribute is JEHOVA <hi>Seboath,</hi> which is as much as to say, the God of Armies, the God of jubilation, rest, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; &amp; therefore the port or channell, by which his beames or irradiations do pass, is called <hi>Netzeth,</hi> which signifieth triumph and victory: as also Justice, Charity, and Love: and therefore the influence of generation, and multiplication, and delight issueth from this emanation, which maketh the rowling Globe of the celestiall <hi>Venus</hi> his store-house.</p>
                        <p>The eighth name is <hi>Elohim Saboth</hi> or <hi>Deus exercituum,</hi> the God of Armies, and his port or channell by the which he sendeth forth the influxes or beames of this his property into his celestiall treasury, which is the Globe of <hi>Mercury,</hi> is called by them <hi>Hod,</hi> or praise, honour and formosity; by which afterwards he operateth in this property, by his will on the earth by changeable and mutable effects.</p>
                        <p>The ninth, <hi>Elohai,</hi> that is the Living God, or <hi>Sadal,</hi> that is, the Omnipotent God: and his numeration, or the gate or channell by which he sendeth down his bright influences, is called <hi>Jesod,</hi> that is to say, the basis or foundation, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or rest; and these are received by the Sphere of the Moon, which is as were the celestiall earth: unto the which all the influences in generall do fall, and this is the reason that it is subject to so many and divers mutations. The effects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as well to generation as corruption, is observed on the Earth and in the Sea.</p>
                        <p>The last name or attribute is <hi>Adonai,</hi> or <hi>Dominus</hi>; and his port or gate by which he sendeth forth his illuminations or the active beames of his nature, is tearmed by the Hebrews <hi>Mulchut,</hi> that is, <hi>Regnum</hi> or <hi>Imperium.</hi> And this numeration im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth severity and servility unto the creatures, through Gods anger and wrath; and his influxion is directly into the Elementary world.</p>
                        <p>By which collections and observations of the wisest <hi>Rabbies,</hi> we find that in these Ten generall properties of God, signified by the ten attributes unto the Divine Essence, all things in the world, be they esteemed good or evill; or positive and primitive; or concordant, and aimeable, or discordant, or odious; or in a word either occultly or manifestly opposit, or else concurring in nature or quality un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an other, do originally descend from this fount<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

For if once the ten names of God, which produce ten divers ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, of different conditions, which are sent by the ten foresaid numerations, or sephiroticall ports or channells, do breed contrary effects, both in heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and in earth beneath, it followeth by the foresaid testimony of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> that there must be so many angelicall vehicles, to conduct them into the lower world, as there are Cabalisticall ports and channells; and consequently as many diversities of the divine properties, proceeding from the variety of his will, as also varieties of vehicles to conduct them. For I would have each judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to conceive, that the Hebrew Doctors did judge of the nature and property of each Name or attribute ascribed unto God in holy Writ, by that self-same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which it produced, after the uttering or expressing of it therein, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than the Philosopher useth to judge of the nature and property of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion by the aspect of the Physiognomy; or as by the signes whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Now (as I have proved before) if it be the divine influence of light, which animateth and informeth each angelicall spirit, it must needs follow, that every one of these angelicall conductions, or vehicles of these influences must have also a divers property; because the formall influences which do animate these intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences which carry them, are different<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore they will be naturally prone and enclined to operate the will of the Creator, according unto the nature of emanation, or beams of that property, which it receiveth from his proper port.</p>
                        <p>As concerning therefore those angelicall receptacles, or organs, which are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to receive the divers kinds of divine influences, or irradiations, I purpose briefly to expresse them in the first place, for the better understanding of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with the channell they do belong unto; and then the order of Angels which doth first receive them. After this I will set down the celestiall Orbes or Stars, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57108:94"/>
the which, as unto their particular store-houses, they are conveyed. And lastly, I will speak somewhat of the effects that these influences, which are conveyed down from their starry treasury, into the elementary world, do effect, both in the aire, seas, or water and earth. Touching therefore the Names or attributes of God, as also their emanations, or streaming forth of beams, with their peculiar proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I have in few words written them, in the precedent Chapter; as for the rest, I would have the Reader to know, that those ten severall divine emissions of ten se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall lights, out of so many Sephiroticall or Cabalisticall spouts or channells, into the vast cavity of the world, to accomplish the will of the Creator, have their particular angelicall waggoners or conductors; for in this, the best Theoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers agree, that as the upper Order of the Angels, do receive their light and bright emanations immediately from God, so do they emit them and manifest them unto the inferiour Orders; and for this reason they are called Mirrours, because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their light from the face of God, or his eternall catholick emanation, which (as I have proved before) is the head and fountain of all these Angelicall lights. And again, as the secret Theologians have, by their serious observation of the holy Bible, espied ten distinct properties, as also ten divers cognominations, or Names of God, appropriated unto them; so they perceived, that there was a singular An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel appointed to receive each of these emissions of beams, endued with the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same property or condition, as the lights which they receive do possesse, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as these Spirits do live, and are animated by them, being that as the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the Angell is a spirituall aire, so the internall of it is the formall irradiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or emanation, which is according unto Gods will emitted into it. And this is a generall note amongst all the secret Theologians, unto whom <hi>Bartholomaeus</hi> and St. <hi>Dennis</hi> do adhere, touching this point, that no Angell can intermeddle with anothers businesse, or take upon him the work that belongeth unto another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be such inferiour Angels, as are destinated to serve under their Arch-angels in the same function or property, as shall be said more at large.</p>
                        <p>We must therefore understand, that the office of the great and catholick Angell <hi>Mitattron,</hi> was so universall, that it was employed first about the information of the whole world, and the division of light from darknesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as also, for the vivifying of the watry spirit of the world, and the diurnall rouling about of the heavens: And therefore it is said, and not without a good cause, That it was the divine and generall Emanation, that is the eternall Sapience, which for this reason is said to be created before all things, by whom afterward all things were made or created. And for this reason it is said, That this Angel doth contain in it all the angelicall perfection, no otherwise than the universall beams of the Sun are comprehended in the body of the Sun. Wherefore we do with the Hebrew Rabbies justly apply the essence of the first emanation unto <hi>Mitattron,</hi> which emanation is said to enter by the royall port or gate <hi>Cheter</hi> or <hi>Corona.</hi> For know, that this catholick Angell is said to be the first creature, because it importeth the spirit of the world, which did first receive the first-born son, or the Emperiall emanation, from the Attribute of God called <hi>EHIAH,</hi> which is a name of eternity, for that it containeth and doth respect the time past, the time present, and the time to come. For this cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth this great Angel style it self, <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the end. The first influence therefore which was of universall life and essence, is received by the Angel <hi>Mitattron,</hi> which is for this reason called <hi>Donum Dei,</hi> after it was shouted down from the port <hi>Cheter,</hi> into the highest order of the Angells, called <hi>Seraphin,</hi> which by reason of their propinquity unto the throne of God, are said to burn, or be set on fire with divine love. And hereupon these have their excellent beauty and clearnesse, by reason of this sacred influence, which is so full of the loving benignity of the Father of light. From thence this potent angelicall nature conducts the beams of this light into the convexity of the aetheriall heaven, and there bestowes it as in a generall magazin or store-house; which place it afterwards informs or vivifieth, insomuch that by the admirable action and motion thereof, it is called <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> or that sphear which moveth first in the heavens, and by his motion it turneth the naturall or temporall world round about, from the East unto the West, in twenty four houres. The mover is this catholick Angel of the world, full of this eternall emanation, by which it animates the world. Therefore also is <hi>Sapientia</hi> said to be <hi>omnium rerum priùs creata, the first of all creatures</hi>; and, <hi>Fluxus virtutis Dei, &amp; emana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of God, and the shining forth of his brightnesse, which is the most movable of all things, penetrating all things by his purenesse, and being one in essence, reneweth all things, that is, it reviveth every thing.</hi> By which it is plain, that this catholick emanation is the soul of the world, having endued, or put on, the universall angelicall spirit, and therefore is called by the holy Text, a Creature; so that the catholick created spirit of the world is the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> for by this first-born emanation from God, it is animated and moved, as by the swiftest mover in the world; and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is tearmed <hi>Primus motor,</hi> both together; or called <hi>Mundi anima,</hi> which therefore is defined to be, in respect of the created spirit thus animated, <hi>Primum mobile, spo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this work is therefore assigned unto this sphear, with the legions of intelligences, that are derived from, and created there by their catholick head, which is the said grand Arch-angell, as beams from one Sun, partly to hinder the starry lights, which were after created, from burning the elementary world, or working by their long continued impression, too violent and unnaturall alterations; as also to make a proportionable day and night unto the earth. To conclude, by this angelicall act, the whole spirit of the world was generally inacted.</p>
                        <p>The divine emanation, which issued from the second Sephiret or port, called <hi>Hochma,</hi> which is sent out by the Attribute <hi>IAH,</hi> passeth into the order of the Cherubins, (which signifieth the plenitude of Science, and abundance of the gifts of Wisdom) and is received of the Arch-angel <hi>Zophiel,</hi> which, by the etymology of his name, argueth pulchritude, as being replenished with an infinity of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar beams of life: But another calleth this keeper, and conductor of these beams, <hi>Ruziel,</hi> who immediately doth direct them into the firmament or heaven of the fixt starrs, and principally into the broad girdle of the starry heaven, which is called the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> arguing by the etymology of his name, that the beams of this emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do chiefly work, and fashion out ideally, the liniments of an infinity of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities in the elementary world, as shall be demonstrated hereafter.</p>

Thus therefore were all creatures in the world, as well spirituall as corporall, composed; and thus were they vivified and animated by beams, the one either contrarie unto the other, or else by reason of their concordance, and likeness of nature, rejoycing greatly when they meet together, by irradiation of all one influence. And we must know and understand, that although each creature had his radicall information by these Emanations, yet in their generations and multiplications, they may vary from the condition of their created or generated Parents, by the uniting together of two different irradiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at the hour of their birth; So therefore cometh it to pass, that a man both in shape and condition, may be unlike unto his Parents; a horse more fierce or sluggish then his sire; a plant or fruit more lax, waterish, or unwholsome then the stock from whence the seed or sap came, and consequently by the application of Angelicall beams of an opposite nature, in the birth of a man, it may happen, that the radiation of a plant, or flower, or beast, or such like thing, may for ever An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathise with this man, which did aptly agree and Sympathise with another. And whereas the opposition which is made between the contrary Elements, is apparent and manifest, namely in respect of the fight or discord, which is made betwixt dissonant qualities or natures, as are cold, and heat; moisture, and drouth; So that in this case the Sympathy and Antipathy of Elements are well known to every one, namely betwixt the water and fire; and betwixt the earth and the aire; We must know that there is yet a more latent, and internall cause of Sympathy, and Antipathy in things, which by some is ascribed unto the occult natures of the Starrs; but in verity it proceedeth from those Angelicall influences, which do invisibly and after a most occult manner, stream out of creatures that are born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a discordant Emanation, which <hi>Reuchlin</hi> doth passingly well describe in these words:<note place="margin">

                           </note>First, I must have you know, that the most internall and profound Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers are of opinion, that every star of heaven hath a nature or condition appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated unto it self, in which the projection of his beams with others is contained: and as every one of them hath a proper nature, which is not totally found in any other, wherein the emission of beams is comprehended, so these beams are observed to be of a divers condition, even as the stars themselves are divers in nature; for every star hath his scituation in the heavens, clean distinct and different from another. And therefore it followeth necessarily, that each of them hath a respect different from one another, and unto all other things or places contained in this world. Now it is certain, that the variety of the aspect doth vary the effect of the beams, as also divers other properties of the stars perform the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where upon it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that each star doth operate otherwise, and effecteth another thing in divers places and subjects, how little soever, or how smally different, being that the whole operation of the stars doth proceed of the beams, which do vary in every diverse aspect in themselves. For the beams which issue from the center of the star, unto the center of the earth, are found, and by experience are justified, to be the strongest in the manner or kind of their operation; but the beam which is eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated or emitted obliquely, is debilitated and weakened in effect, according unto the proportion of his oblique motion, unlesse it be strengthned and comforted by the concurring beams of other stars, in the same place or point: for each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar star casteth his beams to every place. And therefore the diversity of beams be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing collected or gathered together, doth alter the content of each place or sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon it happeneth, that in every place, and at every time, diversity of individuall creatures are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this world; all which, the celestiall harmony is said to effect, by the proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of beams into this lower elementary region, which do continually vary and diversifie themselves. By this therefore it is evident, that the eradiations of all the stars, have divers operations in the things of this world, according unto the divers properties of the things; forasmu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreover we ought to note, that the condition of the heavenly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> harmony is such, that since all the stars are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers natures, and by reason hereof, all their beams are of divers effects in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary world, it happeneth, that the beamy operations are assisted or aided about the same matter or subject; and again, in another matter, are hindred of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Moreover we must observe, that over every thing in this world, there is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a predominant star. And again, there is some celestiall Signe, that in the work and government of the same thing, beareth the rule above all other. Out of this condition therefore of the starry beams between themselves, there ariseth so great a difference and diversity in things of this world, that there can be hardly found two thing or more, which are alike in all respects unto one another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though human sense be not in some cases sufficient, to apprehend the difference.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, the celestiall harmony worketh so differently in divers places and times, that now it generateth or produceth like of like, and at other times it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth things that are unlike. Also it produceth like things at this time by a like motion, and at another time unlike by an unlike motion: now by a slow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then by a swift motion. Thus therefore we see, that by innumerable kinds of other waies, the things of this world, and their motions, are observed to vary, according unto places and times.</p>

Thus far I have expressed the opinions of the learned <hi>Astronomers,</hi> touching the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall radiations, and thereby also it is manifested unto us, that each creature in the Elementary world, is not onely informed by these celestiall beames, which have been poured out upon them, but are preserved by assi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For we must know, (as I proved in my Radicall Inquisition) that the essentiall beams descending from God to the Angels, and from the Angels unto the Starrs, and from the Starrs unto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are continuall because indivisible: For there is no formed Virtue issuing from God, that can be separated from its Fountain; which being so, it must needs follow, that they shine forth out of the body in which they are, unto other lights, which are sent out from other creatures, no otherwise then one star of heaven, doth behold another, in this or that aspect: Wherefore mark me well, what I now say: I told you that each star in heaven, hath his friend, and he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hath his enemy; I told you that the reason of this opposition, as well among the Angells, as starrs of heaven, was the diversity of the Volunty of God, which was the cause of such opposite Attributes, as are by the Hebrew Text (which the Cabalisticall Rabbies do approve of) expressed and avouched; I proceed therefore thus, and say, That if in the heavenly harmony it happeneth, that there is a potent aspect or streaming forth of beams, which concurreth with the irradiation of the aethereall or starry Lord of life, of the thing generated or produced, being animal, vegetable, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narell; And that if by Emanation the star so partaking with the Lord of Life, be an utter enimy unto the Lord of Life, then will the spirit of that creature so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated or made, be subject to discordant passions, as fear, anger, sadness, and suspition; and that especially when the enemy unto the Lord of Life, being more potent in the celestiall Scheme or Horoscop, doth apply unto the Lord of Life, being any way debilitated by an evill aspect; So that this way happeneth a kind of insensible antipatheticall perturbation unto the spirit of the thing so generated or produced. Also if the thing produced or generated, do begin his nativity, when the enemy was most potent in heaven, then when his proper Lord, and he be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the first Lord, in any bad aspect, if at that time that creature be brought into the presence of that other creature, which was first mentioned, there must needs be an antipatheticall distast in the spirit of the first, because the Genius of the last is timorous and affraid of the Genius of the first, which is his enemy, being more powerfull; and therefore the two earthly subjects of these different starrs being present, and emitting the beams of their nature, those beams must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity work antipathetically with one another, and the strongest must prevail no
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57108:98"/>
otherwise, than the two starrs of heaven, which made the mixtion of beams were enemies. But you must note and observe, that though the stronger beams be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipatheticall unto the weaker, it followeth not that the weaker beams be antipathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall unto the stronger, being alwaies that the stronger passion is in the weaker, as the action remaineth in the stronger. But if the Subject of a star in heaven be brought in on earth unto the subject of his enemy in heaven, if there was not in the nativity any aspect between them, they operate not antipathetically with their beams being present, and yet their natures or beams will be by so much the more inclined to actuall opposition, if at the time of their meeting, the enemies aspect on one another with an evill aspect in heaven. As for example; If that <hi>Jupiter</hi> be Lord of the nativity, or production of the thing, and <hi>Mars</hi> do aspect him in a quadrat or opposit aspect; and this creature, suppose it be a Man, doth meet with a Cat, the Lord of whose nativity is <hi>Mars,</hi> most powerfull in heaven, aspecting <hi>Jupiter</hi> with a malevolent irradiation, then will the sight of this Cat be unpleasant unto that Man. But the truth is, that there may be some fixt star, which is the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed originall, or protector of the cat or animal of what nature soever, which may be antipatheticall unto the fixt star with the Planet in it, that have dominion over the cat. But contrariwise, if the beams of two Planets or signs, or more, do meet, or concurre in one, and the same generation or production of a thing, where the star which hath most dominion is Lord of the thing, be it animal or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, or mineral, and these Planets are friends to one another, then if any other Subject present it self, which is fashioned by the beams of the other Planet, these two Subjects emitting their beams upon the earth, will love each other, and sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetically agree with one another, and so much the greater will their Sympathy be unto one another, by how much they accord unto one another in nature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and benevolence of aspect, in the instant of their nativities or beginnings. As for example: If <hi>Jupiter</hi> be Lord of a man's nativity, and aspect <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> him, in a Sextil or Trine aspect; and again, <hi>Venus</hi> is the most powerfull in the nativity of a cat or dog; and hath a relation by his beams unto <hi>Jupiter</hi> in a good aspect: then I say, that there will be a reciprocall affection in Sympathy betwixt both creatures, Also, if the like friendship be made in heaven, at the bringing forth of any vegetable, the man or beast will be well pleased at the presence, view, and tast of that vegetable; and if he eate of it, it will well agree with his nature. And all this is to be understood in things, which from their Creation were not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained quite opposit and antipatheticall unto the creature, as are vermin and such like; the which nevertheless are made by these concordant irradiations of heaven, more amiable and less harmfull; yea, and more convenient for the use of mans or beasts bodies. Also there is since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> enmity set between the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and Man; and yet by the like confluence in heaven, some affect Serpents or Snakes; some by the concurrence of contrary beams, do loth and fly from them, with an exceeding detestation, and do abhorre them beyond all measure. But to return again unto the root of this business, the evident cause of Sympathy and Antipathy of things, proceedeth from the radical Mystery of the opposite Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes or properties in God, which have the originall of their Emanation, from the secret and hidden Volunty of Eternity, as I have told you here before. And yet these <hi>Astrologians</hi> have such reasons from their starry experiences, that they all take their Originall of Sympathy or Antipathy from them.

the whole world, which I said before to be that <hi>Anima mundi</hi> of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> which did animate every particular thing, by sending out of an infinity of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall beams; we may perceive, that these mysticall Hebraick Theosophers did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that very power,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.</note> which the Apostle doth in the place before mentioned assigne unto our Lord Jesus Christ. Being that as they made this: <hi>Mitattron</hi> the catholick Angell, or <hi>Praefectum universitati,</hi> the ruler of the world, proceeding by emanation from <hi>Ensoph</hi> or Infinity; so the Apostle saith, that all forms, and what else, proceedeth from God the Father, and have their being from our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>To our purpose therefore. As God ordained from his infinite fountain of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, two principles of a clean contrary nature, namely, Light and Darknesse; so the first-born of Darknesse was <hi>Litigium,</hi> or the Prince of darknesse, which was termed Sathan, and his rule is in darknesse, and over all dark things, or privative proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and he hath his four-fold Angels or Demons of a different nature, which have their dominions over the winds and elements, and are ready to effect their Prince his behests, in a businesse of darknesse, and therefore of discord and privation, be it of the property of what winde that bloweth, according unto that of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps, I saw four angels standing upon the four angles of the earth,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Apoc. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>being presidents over the four winds of the earth, unto whom it was granted to hurt the earth and the seas, &amp;c.</hi> Now each of these Angells have many divisions, and subdivisions of legions under them, who do then act at their volunty, when they have dominion to blow and trouble the aire. All these are animated by the influences which are sent down from the Olympick spirits, as they likewise have their animation and times of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion appointed them, by the Emperiall Arch-angell: And these are the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate dispensators of the will of their eternall head and well-spring. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son therefore, as we ocularly behold that the Sun-beams do illuminate wholly what object soever the same looketh upon, being enlightned, by reason of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of beams which are united in and upon it: So also all emanations which are carried down unto the stars, do fill them with an infinity of beams, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of subdivided Angells, having the nature of all that whole emanation which did animate the stars. And therefore all the Olympick spirits of each star are alike in property. The self-same reason also there is, from the angelicall beams which issue from each wind, and fill the whole aire, and water, and earth, with an innumerable number of hurtfull spirits, of their nature. And yet it is sure, that as God made all things to exist and be, (as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith) he had a care to appoint over the winds as many good Angells,<note place="margin">Sap. 1.</note> with their inferiour spirits, which arise from their good beams, to over-rule the malice of the bad spirits, with their subjects, which also have their abidings in the aire. And, that each of these hurting or harmfull angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Presidents of the winds have a master to curb his malice, it appeareth by the consequence of the foresaid Text,<note place="margin">Apoc. 7.</note>

Howsoever, it was that empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Angell that had victory over the Dragon and his Angells, and therefore hath them his vassalls. So that as Satan is the Prince of darknesse, and an enemy unto light, and therefore unto Christ and his creatures; so this great Angell, in whom is JEHOVA's Name, (as the Scripture affirms) in which is life, and in whom is light without darknesse, is the Prince of light, and hath power over light, position, and life, and therefore an utter enemy unto darknesse, with the Prince thereof. And for that cause, as Satan hath his armies scattered in the aire, by the four winds; so also hath the emperiall and victorious Prince of light, his conducting Angells, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed over the face of the earth and waters, and in every place over the catholick element of the aire, to resist the violent and subtle or invisible assaults of the army

or spirits of darkness; which good spirits also are under the conduct of four good Captains, of the nature of the four winds; which Captains are full of goodness, and grace. Therefore the Mysticall Theologians and Cabalists do aver: <hi>Quod ut in exercitu Dei quatuor sunt Ante signani,</hi>

                        <p>By reason of these spirits of a contrary fortitude in the aire, sometimes good and propitious events befall the creatures of this lower world, namely when the good spirits raigne, and wholsome winds do blow, which happen, when the benign starrs and Planets have dominion in heaven, and consequently their influences below; and again, somtimes bad and dysastrous accidents, armed with privative and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive effects, befall the creatures of this Elementary region, by reason of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere emissions of beams from the winds, which animate those evill spirits, that in infinite multitudes do hover, though invisible, in the aire; who are rejoyced and revived at the blasts which issue from the stations of their cruell Princes, and are as it were summons and all-arms to stir and excite them unto wrath, and to blow the coles of their sleeping malice.

and all this chanceth in the lower habitation, in the which we are,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby he signifieth, that the whole air is replenished as well with spirits of darknesse, as with spirits of light.

the dark Chaos, (which act was effected by the spagerick vertue of the bright ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or word of the eternall Unity) the humid or watry nature of the world was created; that is to say, essentially informed, by the lively presence of the said all-informing Spirit; so that through that union of two contrary natures in one, namely, the informing essence, or naturating nature; and the informed substance, or the nature naturated; the spirit of the world was animated, and afterwards by the wisest Philosophers termed the <hi>Anima mundi,</hi> which is that angelicall compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of two, called therefore by the Sages <hi>Alteritas,</hi> as God in his simple nature is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Identitas.</hi> Now the passive portion, of which alterity was made, is said to be the humid created nature, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The union of these two maketh the catholick soul of the world, called in respect of the simple, creating, and vivifying emanation, <hi>Mens</hi>; in regard onely of the spirit informed, <hi>Spiritus</hi>; and, as these two are united in one, <hi>Anima.</hi> Lo here the third degree of the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patheticall and antipatheticall progression, from the simple root of eternity, namely, the created matter or spirit in the soul of the world, being the child or off-spring of darknesse, or the dark Chaos, which is therefore naturally prone unto the negative or privative effects of darknesse, and consequently apt in its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to receive any discordant and antipatheticall impression, which the ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall spirits of darknesse shall imprint upon it. For as the sacred light, which ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the humid spirit of the world, and consequently the whole masse of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whereof the heaven and the earth was made, (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> doth justifie) is the most movable, agill, and active of all things; so on the contrary party, the matter that is informed, and therefore the created body and spirit, is most degenerate from it, in that it is no way enclined of its own nature unto motion or life. For the Philosophers words are, <hi>Materia est per se ad motum inefficax, &amp; ab ipsa anima seu luce degenerans.</hi> Wherefore of its selfe it endueth its mother <hi>Chaos,</hi> or <hi>Hyles</hi> her condition, and is enclined to rest, immobility, darknesse, cold, spissitude, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation: For this cause therefore it suffereth the impressions and characters of both oppositions, to wit, sometimes it enclineth unto darknesse, and then it groweth spisse, opak, cold, immobil, thick, and ponderous, and tendeth in that his property downwards to the cold center, or the seat of darknesse, which is its mother; and then it is in rebellion and opposition with light, motion, and heat, and so it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipatheticall unto the actions of light and life; as we see the airy spirit of the world, which is clear, light, diaphan, thin, movable, and soaring upward, by the operating power of the descending light, becommeth by the Northern cold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed, opak, spisse, and immobil, or fixed into snow, hail, ice, frost, and such like. So that by this antipatheticall accession of the cold characters of the dark abysse, it is discordant from the loving union, and symphoniacall accesse, which it had unto the region of light. Contrariwise, the bright form of the soul, which is the essence of that eternall emanation, doth give the matter or spirit of the soul's life, action, motion, hear, tenuity, and diaphanity, and that more or lesse, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it hath power and dominion over it. And we must note, that the more the spirit approacheth unto the nature of light, the firmer are the bonds of its sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall accords. For as sympathy doth consist of things of a like nature, so the nearer the spirit approacheth unto form, the greater is the sympathy and accord, the surer the tie, and the more virtuous the effect; for the more that the created spirit is illuminated, the lesse it remembers that naturall inclination and love, that it had unto its dark originall; insomuch that by such an extream purified exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it becommeth as it were deified: And therefore <hi>Plato</hi>'s opinion is, that if the middle spirit, which is between the mentall beam, and the dark bodily substance, doth more adhere unto the divine or mentall beam, than the dark body, then it will become a good Demon or Angel; but if it respect the body more than the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine beam, it will descend unto the nature of a Cacodemon, or spirit of darknesse. Also by Scripture we are taught, that by adhering unto this divine light, namely, unto Christ, we shall be transformed into the same image, to wit, if we forsake this dark world, and the lusts of the obscure body or flesh. But to return unto the soul of the great world. If the airy spirit be given over unto the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it becommeth bodily, and turnes into the same image, namely, frost, snow, hail, &amp;c. but if the hot effect, or the formall act of light, prevail a degree over the stupid cold of darknesse, it leaveth his opake quality, and becommeth diaphan, and

returneth from an earthly, fixt, and obscure nature, unto a clear, transparent, and fluxible substance; and by another degree of the divine act, it is made more subtle, more dilated, more invisible and pure, and it is called Aire; by a third it is purified unto fire; by a fourth unto aether, when it loseth all the appetite of mutation, and forgetteth the privative stock from whence it came: by a fifth it becommeth angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or emperiall; and so it is exalted more and more in dignity, according as it is more and more obedient unto the actions of the eternall and catholick influence of form, which shineth forth from the fountain of infinity. For we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the whole inclination of the eternall emanation, is to reduce this child of darknesse unto eternall light, unity, and life; as contrariwise, the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the potentiall darknesse, which is the stamp of Gods <hi>Nolunty,</hi> or privative nature, are clean contrary. So that all the end of the creating light's action, is to unite all by the symphoniacall band of love and unity, and consequently of sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, namely, by making the catholick child of darknesse like it self, and therefore to make two to compassionate each other. But contrariwise, that of darknesse is evermore enclined to make duality of unity, and to breed discord, by violating the bands of concord, and so to procreate a new antipathy and hatred, thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the fruits of love. So that the spirit which light hath redeemed out of the dark Chaos, is the intermediate subject betwixt both the extreams, that is to say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween light and darkness: and therefore is the passive subject ordained by the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, to endure the impressions of each opposite extream, whereupon it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth sometimes the subject of sympathy, namely, when it is obedient unto union and light; and sometimes of antipathy, to wit, when it rebelleth against that light. Thus do we see the true subject of all passion in the soul of the world, and this was the onely reason, why the Philosopher <hi>Heraclitus</hi> avowed with such confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, That all things were composed of strife and friendship; and <hi>Empedocles,</hi> That the soul was made of amity and enmity. I will now therefore expresse unto you that concordant order, which that eternall love, who shined out from the Father of light and love, hath put and placed in each region of this world, to distinguish the two different natures from one another, by placing between them an intermediate subject, which doth agree with each extream. And first I will speak of the orders in the universall spirit of the world, and lastly, of every particular vivified, and inacted spirit, as well in the intellectuall or emperiall, as vitall or aetheriall, and naturall or elementary heaven, and that in order.</p>
                           <p>We must place the two opposite principles in this world, in the two extreams of the semidiameter thereof; and first, we imagine the seat of the God of light, or of the divine act, to consist in the convexity of the higher and purer Orbe of the Angells, or Emperiall Heaven, (I speak unto the vulgars understanding) that is in the circumference of the vawted world; and then we deem the throne of darknesse, or the divine puissance, to be in the center thereof, as the furthest place from its opposite in nature, which is light. Here you may see the two principles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and discord, of love and hatred, and consequently of sympathy and antipathy, of the effects whereof all the Scripture and each member of Philosophy, is full. The catholick matter which was originally extracted out of darkness, namely, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which was made the materiall substance, (of which the heavens and the earth were framed by the divine word, doth occupy all that space which the world containeth) was by the celestiall Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore this portion of the waters was ordained for the seat of the good Angells. The lower waters contrariwise, as being fecall, gross, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, and therefore more rebellious unto light, and obedient by participation unto darknesse, were placed next unto their dark beginning, namely, the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and did possess all that space between the starry heaven and the earth, which is called Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, and for this cause is subject to all changes of generation and corruption: And this was ordained to be the seat of Satan and his angels, which is for that cause called the Prince of this world,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.

To conclude, that middle spirit in the world, called the Firmament, which divideth both the extreamly-differing waters from one another, and is that intermediate spirit of the world, which doth equally participate, and behold each extreme, is the Centrall mansion of that eternall Spirit, which emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his beams from his stately Solar, or sunny palace, even unto the Center of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and extendeth his emanation even unto the seat of Light, which is his root: for his brightness is emitted from the attribute ELOAH, by the beautifull or glorious port, or gate TIPHERETH: which importeth, grace, beauty, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritude, by the Angelicall order of the Virtues, into that purified pallace of the Sun: So that by his emanating presence, he penetrateth every where, and fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things by his presence, and vivifieth all things by his Virtue, and is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of life, vegetation, multiplication, and preservation, and hath made his seat in the Center of the heavens, that by one most perfect Consonant, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a spirituall Diapason, he might illuminate the Angels above, and the stars round about him, and that by a more material Diapason, he might penetrate into the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the elementary world, to communicate his perfection to each creature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that they might be beautified by his bright presence, and vivified by the pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating beams of his essence, and consequently that the imps or spirits of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness may be debilitated by the appearance of his Glory; as if one chord were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended betwixt the Fountain of Light and the abysse of darkness, which being struck, made an unison, but being pressed down and divided directly in the middle of it, each part will render, being struck, a double diapason, unto that unison, importing a double perfection, proceeding from the bright catholick Emanation; whereof the one respecteth the adorning of the lower waters, with life and virtue, and the other maketh an accord of friendship among the higher. Now as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Sun, and substance of the Aether is of a middle or mean spirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or consistence of the waters, it is evident, that it also is subject to be altered by passion, as well Antipatheticall, as Sympatheticall: For else it would not be the immediate receptacle of those opposit and contrary Emanations, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from the differing Attributes: But by effect we find the contrar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that is, of contraction by the property of matter, and dilatation by the Act of the formall Light; So that the nature of matter, is to draw by contraction from the Circumference unto the Center: but the condition of the formall essence is quite contrary unto it: For it doth dilate or emit his beams from the Center to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore this augmentation of Light, mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the frozen waters a little, and did make them fluxible and transparent: So that he partly by reason of the continuity of his matter, with that of the earth, and partly because of its cold nature, it is a temperate friend of the earth, and taketh his place next unto him; So that it is not so cold as the earth, nor so moist as the aire: For it is not enough subtiliated, till the bright Agent of the world bestoweth on the dark watery abysse, above the water, three portions of his Light; So that it converted part of the gross lower waters, into a thinner and more light shape, than was the watery Element; and it was the aire which by reason of the triple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of formall light was hotter, and more dilated, then was the water; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the water was cold, (but not so cold as the earth,) and moist, (but not so moist as the aire;) So the aire is hot, but not so hot as the fire; and moister then the water. By reason therefore of his moisture, this portion of the catholick Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is friendly to the water on the one side, and on the other side unto the fire, because of his heat. Lastly, that in-created Spirit of life did yet multiply a part of those waters, by an other or higher degree, of subtility and purity; So that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the most subtil and highest portion of the generall Elements, and is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hot and dry; wherefore by reason of its drouth, it agreeth on the one side with the earth which in circulation is next unto him, and on the other side with the aire, in respect of his heat; but it is hotter then the aire, and not so dry as the earth. Lo here you see the effect of that Sympathy, which the Peace and Love of God, did put among the discordant enemies of this world: For thereby the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as a friend to both the aire and earth, becometh a stickler, and mediator of peace between them. The aire, as a friend unto the two enemies fire and water, is made an indifferent judge betwixt them both; So that the one contrary is kept from strugling and tugging with the other, by the super-celestiall and golden tie of peace.<note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> Thus you see, that this Spirituall Christ doth (as the Apostle saith) <hi>bear and sustain all things by the word of his Virtue.</hi> And as <hi>Hermes</hi> said, <hi>the humid na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the assistance of the world,</hi>

water doth cruelly invade the limits of the fire, and all will be out of order, and in a destructive war with one another, were it not for the presence of this Lord of misrule. Thus, as you see, will Dyscracy and Antipathy reigne by their turnes, in the neather region of the world, when the tye of the elements are loose. Thus will friendship be quickly changed into hatred, when JEHOVA is pleased to send forth his altering winds, and to corroborate and animate by his influence from above, the ministers of his wrath here below, against the sublunary creature.</p>
                           <p>Now come I to prove, that all sympatheticall and antipatheticall effects, do proceed from the secret and occult actions of the ministring spirits of this world. That there is a mighty difference amongst the Angels, no man of wisdom can deny; for though all Angels were at the first united unto the divine Unity, yet by reason of the rebellion and ambition of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that knot of union was broke; and then the waters were divided from the waters, that the good Angels might be separated and distinguished from the bad, by the interposition of the firmament, as a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma or middle bar, between each of their habitations: So that the dark Angels were enclosed in the lower, or dark, fecall, and dreggy waters; and the light An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were lodged in the higher waters, which were illuminated and dignified by a super-celestiall light and glory.</p>
                           <p>Thus you may see, that the very Angells of heaven, forasmuch as they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of aire, or the humid spirit of the world, (which is their externall) and the bright emanation from Unity, (which is their internall) are subject, by reason of their materiall sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is referred unto the nature of the firmament, which is the region of life and salutary love; and the last unto the angelicall and intellectuall heaven, which doth discern between things that belong unto the lower heavens, or regions of the world. Whereupon it appeareth, that from her rationall property, every sense be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto the soul of man doth proceed; as, from the other two, every affection, motion, or passion of the minde, doth arise and spring. Now there are known to be four affections of the soul, whereof two do proceed from her concupiscible power, namely, Joy and Hope, (for at that which we love, we rejoyce and are glad; or, we hope for and expect, that which shall rejoyce us or make us glad) and the two other issue from her irascible faculty or vertue, namely, Grief or Dolour, and Fear; for now we grieve at that which we hate, or we fear that which would make us grieve, or be dolorously affected. And verily, we shall, after a due inquisition, find, that these four affections of the Microcosmicall soul, are not onely the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and common matter or subject of all morall vices or vertues, but also the originalls of Metaphysicall or occult, and Physicall or elementary, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sympathy and antipathy, as well in the little as in the great world, and every creature thereof. For I would not have you ignorant, that being the soul in man is derived from the vivifying emanation, dwelling in the words spirituall vehicle, it must follow, that that soul in the great world must needs have in it the faculties, which the little worlds soul hath; for, <hi>Quod facit tale, est magis tale.</hi> But these facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the soul of man were derived from the great world, and the eternal soul that vivified it. Wherefore it followeth, that there is a rationability, a concupiscibility, and an irascibility in the soul of the great world, though not made manifest unto us: First, because that it hath attributes of irascibility and displeasure; for from his Attribute <hi>ELOHIM Gibbor,</hi> he sendeth down by the port <hi>Geburah,</hi> the fiery beams of his displeasure, by his Archangell <hi>Samael,</hi> into the globe or sphear of <hi>Mars,</hi> who is for that cause President of the irascible faculty of the greater world;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57108:103"/>
wherefore his influences do cause wrath and angry effects in the aire and earth, as thunder, lightnings, comets, and other wrangling accidents, which (as Scriptures tell us) are the arguments of Gods wrath and vengeance; also war, famine, and pestilence; and augmenteth the angry nature and spirit of men and beasts. And again, Gods Attribute <hi>IEHOVA Sabaoth</hi> poureth down the beams of concupisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, by the Arch-angell <hi>Anael,</hi> upon the globe of <hi>Venus,</hi> according to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Astronomers, who for that reason, being moved thereto by experience and observation, have made this star the president and rectrix of the concupiscible faculty: As the Attribute <hi>EL</hi> doth pour out the beams of reason, justice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yea, and naturall vegetation and life, into the sphear of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally this naturall faculty is rained into the soul of the world, by the Attribute <hi>IAH,</hi> through his port <hi>Sapientia</hi> or Wisdom. The second reason is, because the great world hath an intellectuall or rationall heaven, and a concupiscible property manifested in every creature; and an irascible, which is apparent also by reason of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and horrour, which appeareth between one thing and another. Also, that there is an irascible quality in the elements, that deadly hatred which is betwixt the fire and water, and the aire and earth, doth manifest. That also there is a love and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence between things, it is evident, because one nature rejoyceth in his like; and therefore by a naturall inclination, every thing doth move and convert it self unto his like, by all possibility; but especially it is most inclinable unto it self. So we see, that fire doth naturally affect and move unto fire, water unto water, and earth unto earth. But above all, the vivifying spirit of every living thing, which is celestiall, and therefore exceedeth the place of the elements, doth with fervency affect and thirst after his like, and is rejoyced at the presence and concurrency thereof. And for this cause, this passion of what creature soever, will be the more truly sympatheticall; and the sympathy between things will be so much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of more force, by how much the nearer the spirits of the things, either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or dispersed, are in nature and consanguinity to one another. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, If that both be of one minier or thing, in number; also like specifick individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, though they differ in number, as the <hi>Uznea,</hi> fat, or blood of one man do sympathise with another, <hi>ad distans</hi>; the Load-stone of one Mine may affect har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monically the Iron of another, <hi>ad distans</hi>: And I told you before the true reason thereof, as well radicall as immediate, namely, because both the natures belong unto one divine influence, or proceed from angelicall beams or an emanation, sent forth from one and the same star, as well fixed, namely, of the firmament, or eighth sphear, as erratick and planetary. For I told you, that there is not one ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, or vegetable, or mineral upon the earth, or in the seas, which hath not a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar star, that poureth out upon him his proper influence, as well to produce and generate its like, and to continue it in succession, as to preserve and maintain it in essence. Now each angelicall nature hath his appropriated beams, from the radicall emanation of some divine Attribute, which conveyeth it to his destinated or star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry store-house; and from the Olympick spirits of that star, it is sent down unto such spirits in the elements, as are their inferiour ministers, which operate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the self-same nature in each specifick, and every individuall there. As for example, The stars in the <hi>Ram</hi> or <hi>Aries</hi> of the Zodiack, have chiefest influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over such like cattle on the earth; and the <hi>Scorpion</hi> over the like creeping things thereof: the <hi>Crab,</hi> over such like creatures of the sea; for we finde by experience, that if the Crab be taken when the Sun and Moon do joyne together, according unto the Longitude or degree of the Aequinoctiall, in which the great star of the celestiall Crab's claw is found, it is of mighty vertue and power against poyson; and if it be collected or taken at another time, it will have but small effect. Again, we must note, that each fixt star, or constellation of the Zodiack, hath his proper Planet, whose peculiar House he is, which concurreth in the fortification and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of that influence. For the diversity of application of other Planets unto it, doth cause a variety of operation, even in the same animals sperm, or plants, seed, and mettles secret spirit. And yet howsoever, they do more or less agree and sympathize in nature, as the beams of each Planet, so applying unto one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will give them leave; for if the concurrence be between friendly Planets, and of one and the same triplicity, namely, where their Houses are of friendly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then the sympathy will be the stronger.

Whereby he argueth that the catholick Angelicall spirit, which vivifieth the world, in whose Diviner part cosisteth the Sephiroticall power or Virtue of all the Divine Attributes, in which also (as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> testifieth,) is contained the virtues of the four wind, is the main actor, who by his severall subdivided emissions, of diversly condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned beams, doth operate in and by his starry Organs, all these occult and hidden effects below, which cannot fall into the Sphere or capacity of a common man's understanding, though by effect we find it to be thus and thus; So that there is not a particular beam, that is emitted from it, which hath not a secret disposed act, no otherwise varying from one another than, by ocular experience, we find the effects of them to differ: For whatsoever was originally decreed in the secret Counsell of the Archetype, is effected from a generality unto many Specialities, and from each Speciality unto an infinit number of individuall particularities; So that the aeviall or Angelicall effect, is the image of the eternall <hi>Idea,</hi> and the temporall world, is the similitude of the aeviall; and again, in the temporall or typicall world, every stellar shape is the likenesse or paterne of the Angelicall <hi>Idea</hi>; and again, the Elementary things are the shadows of the spirituall shapes or Images in heaven: Wherefore as God sendeth out his Emanation, which is his Image, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Angelicall world, in a diversity of fashions, and multiplicity of respects; So the Angelicall spirits do send out their severall different Lights unto each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, namely every order unto his inferior, and every upper Sphere unto the Spheres which are below them, and so from the starrs, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence therefore it cometh, that the children of Light, which are grafted unto this catholick illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated spirit, do flie, as from a pestilence the children of darknesse and their works. And the reason is, because this humid created spirit, finding now the pleasure, volunty, and felicity of its illuminated estate, is affraid least the privative beams of darkness, or the dismall Emanations of God's wrath, should dimm their light, and obscure the brightness of life; that is to say, lest they should turn their Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing passions of joy and gladness, into the Antipathizing storms of sadness and mourning, by sucking or contracting the beauteous Emanations of joy, love, and gladness, from the Circumference into the Center of the Spirit, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive it of that salutary and sprightfull irradiation of love and life, by hiding of God's face, which he did emit from the Center to the Circumference of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

                              </gap>s from it, and it lost its beauty, and became dark, against the common course of nature; So that the pleasant Sympathy which it produced by its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence unto the creatures beneath, and in the heavens above, was quite changed into Antipathy for a while. This therefore was a privative passion in the heart of the great world, or as a man may say, a Syncope or swooning of the world, when <hi>ELOAH</hi> did abstain for that season, to pour forth his influence of beauty by the port of TIPHERETH: Also that palpable darkness which happened in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was a privative passion, caused by the hiding away of God's face, or by the contracting the beams of light within himself. Such privative passions also are menaced unto the Sun, Moon, and Starrs, towards the latter end of the world: For if the world was made by the sending forth of God's bright Emanation (for by the Spirit of the Lord the heavens were adorned, as <hi>Job</hi> telleth us) it followeth, that by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it away, all will return again unto darkness, and plain nothing or deformity, even as it was before. But this producing of good and Sympatheticall passions, by emitting of light from the Center to the Circumference; and again, the effects of Antipatheticall passions, which do oppose the concord and Sympathy of life, is excellently described and painted forth, by the due examination of the vital action in man: For as there are noted to be in generall, two severall active Virtues in man's spirit; whereof the one is voluntary, which is the Prince over the other, and commandeth and moveth the inferior actions, even as the Divine Angell <hi>Mitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron</hi> doth in the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> of the great world, which is referred unto the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunty, and moveth by it the celestiall orbs, and Elementary world; so in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosmicall Fabrick, the first mover is that Divine mentall beam which is the head of man's soul; and the other kind is involuntary, because it is commanded and ruleth after the will of the intellectuall or rationall beam, no otherwise then all the lower Orbs are constrained to move, after the will of the mover in the <hi>Primum mobile</hi>; So the vitall action in man, is one of those branches, which is involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and no otherwise subject unto the Volunty of the mental beam, then the star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heaven; (which is the seat of life, forasmuch as the Sun which is the heart of the world, hath his residence there) is commanded by the Emperyall Spirit.</p>
                           <p>Now as we find, that according unto the will of the Divine essence poured out into the heavens, and consequently here below, as well joyfull and compassionate effects do spring from the positive and dilative property of Unity, to recreate and stir up volupty and pleasure in the creature; as also trist and sad effluxions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the contractive Virtue, whereby God hideth the face of his benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from the creatures, and thereupon as well concupiscible as odible or irasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble passions are caused in the world: Even so we find it manifested, as well by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, as by the observation of the learnedest in Physick and Philosophy; that the vitall action, which is over-ruled according unto the mind of the superior Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunty, either is opened or enlarged by the dilative property of the first movers will, and thereby openeth the cabinet of the heart, to produce in the vitall spirit those good passions, which Sympathize with life and light, namely gladness, hope, confidence, love, miserecord, and affability; or it is contracted, and thereby ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth together also the spirits in the heart, whereby is engendred in the vitall spirit such bad privative passions, as do antipathise with those good ones, which rejoyce and comfort the life, and these passions are termed Antipatheticall, because they are wholly contrary unto the nature of those which are good; of which number, proceeding from the hearts contraction, are sadness, care, dispaire, fear, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, anger, furor, bashfullness, and so forth; So that as by the former, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by dilatation did look up unto the Fountain of Light, and did rejoyce to see the volupties and pleasure thereof; So by the later, the spirit was forced by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, to be deprived from the vision of light, and to look p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>To conclude, how this mentall beam receiveth the behests or influxions, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity or severity from above, is expressed in my precedent discourse, namely, by permitting of bad spirits of darkness to reigne and have dominion, or helping the good spirits to execute their offices of joy and delight. Lo, here is contained the sum of all mysticall and hidden sympathy or antipathy in the world, which some do therefore, by reason of the profundity and difficulty in the inquisition thereof, justly attribute unto the secret act and operation of an angelicall power, which is a middle vertue betwixt God and the creature. And for this reason (as is said before) an Angell is defined to be, <hi>Tanquam inter Deum &amp; Naturam virtus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, à qua fiunt operationes in rebus quas vel natura eoram non faceret, non vel sic faceret: quas ali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that we Christians, after we have travelled, and made our peregrination of life and studies in the world, think it sufficient in the end to say, <hi>Aristotle, Plato, Galen, Hippocrates,</hi> and, in conclusion, this man, or that man, said so; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is so: When Scriptures do teach us a truer Philosophy, which is quite contrary unto theirs.

Others having long steered the Helm of their Bark this way, or that way, for to find out the abstruse seat or habitation of this Stones vertues, have scarce dashed their vessell against her rocky Island, but have thereupon returned with wondrous relations, of what they have by that means collected, and, in fine, have proved their new imaginations but as superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as the effects of their search have been; and, in conclusion, all have proved but conjecturall. Others have so far been guided and directed in their search, by the Pole-star allurements, that they have stuck fast in the frozen seas, and have gone no further; but, at the resolution of the ice, they have returned with imaginary wonders, conceived of magneticall Mountaines, and iron Castles, even by eight degrees above the Moon, that is, in the eighth Sphear; yea, and others soar above that place also.

In conclusion, every one hath his opinion somewhat differing from another; and that you may know all this to be true, I will express and recite some of their newes, touching this enquiry, which after their long voyage they have made in the suddy seas of their serious contemplations, and registred them in their written monuments, as in the Chronicles or Histories of their studious adventures, or speculative and spirituall travells. Amongst the which, some foar upwards, and call the heavens for witness, to confirm their assertions; some sail unto the hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boreall mountains, others unto strange northern Islands, to find out the grounds of this miracle; others send their spirits of enquiry down unto the bowells of the earth, and find it to be the universall starry form thereof; some will make the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall to spring atomically out of the stone and subject to be attracted. But amongst all these rationall persons, I dare scarce rank one of another kind; forasmuch as this man surely is to be numbered among those Elders, which have travelled in the ship of fools, being that he, much like an other <hi>Gryllus,</hi> or as the eighth wise Master of <hi>Greece,</hi> will have this vertue to be Cacomagical, or the act of the devill.</p>
                        <p>Now amongst such as have travelled in their spirits unto heaven, to find out this mystery, one will have the reason, for the direction of the Load-stone, to be sought for out of the Tail of the celestiall <hi>Bear</hi>-star, affirming, that the vertue of this starry <hi>Bear</hi> doth prevail, and hath dominion over this Stone, and is transferred from it into the Iron; and that is <hi>Marsilius Fic nus.</hi> But I reply, That this is not so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause experience teacheth us, that Iron of it self hath his Poles, as well as the Load-stone, and will by a due adaption seek out, and by its own naturall instinct turn and direct it self, unto the station of his proper Poles. Of this opinion also is <hi>Petrus Peregrinus,</hi> who following the rules of Frier <hi>Bacon,</hi> have sought the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the magneticall directions out from the Poles of the heaven. Also <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> will have the immediate cause of the variation of this Stones vertue, to spring from the rising of the star in the <hi>Bear</hi>'s Tail; <hi>Lucas Gauricus</hi> is also of their opinion, but he joyneth also the vertue of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in this negotiation,

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57108:106"/>
D. <hi>William Gilbert,</hi> for his Magnetick skill, and deep search as well contemplative as experimentall touching this Subject: His mind is, that this attractive virtue in the Load-stone, doth spring from formall actions, or originall and primary Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues or vigours: For he concludeth, that the Magnetick force proceedeth from a particular or singular form, differing from that formall and specifick cause in mixt bodies, mentioned by the Peripateticks, but (saith he) it is a certain form, which is the proper entity and existence of the starry Globes, and their homogeniall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted parts, which he calleth the Primarie, radicall, and astreall Form, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such a one as is in the Sun, the Moon, and other celestiall Stars. And he averreth, that after a like manner, there is one in the earth, which is that true Magneticall Puissance, which is called the first act or vigor. And this he saith, is not derived from the whole heaven, affirming, that it is procreated by Sympathy, through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, or occult qualities; neither is it from any peculiar starre: For it hath its Magneticall virtue from the earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is my learned <hi>quondam</hi> Fellow-Collegue his opinion, whose pains and industry in the research of this Subject's practicall conclusions, as I cannot but commend and extol; So on the contrary side, reason will not permit me, to consent unto this his speculative foundation or root of the Load-stone's virtue in all: For who can believe, that the earth it self, much less the particulars thereof, can have any Virtue radically from it self; when it is evident, that as well the earth as the heavens, came radically out of the waters? And therefore as the heaven was before the earth, it must needs follow, that the formall Virtue of the earth, did totally descend from heaven, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the earth had no such property from it self. But of this hereafter more at large. Among the Ethnick Philosophers <hi>Plato,</hi> and of the Christians <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Fernelius,</hi> do think, that the cause of this Attraction is Divine and from above; but how, and after what manner they express not. And therefore though in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality they have spoken the truth, yet in these common words they seem to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, they know not what. In particular, I will conclude with the last opinion, which is the most idle and insufficient of all the rest, and therefore is worthy to be made the last and most unworthy part, namely the tayl, or excrement of them. <hi>Franciscus Rucus,</hi> maketh a great doubt, concerning the wonderfull property in the Load-stone, and because (forsooth) the pitch of his capacity can attain no higher then unto Superficiall things, and such as are subject unto sense; therefore he judgeth all effects beyond his reach, to be Cacomagicall, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he maketh a doubt, whether the cause of these actions in the Load-stone be not an impostury or subtill slight of the Cacodemons or evill spirits. And yet this man is more to be born withall, then such as do boldly averre, that the act and wonderfull effects of the Weapon Salve is cacomagicall: For he speaketh not absolutely as they do; who without any farther doubting, do seem to attribute all hidden effects unto the Divell, and so deprive God of his due; but onely this man maketh a doubt, whether it be so or no.</p>

                           <p>In this Chapter, the Author's Opinion touching the originall, intermediate, and immediate Action or Virtue of the Load-stone is enucleated and set down at large.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Am sure you do remember how in my precedent discourse, I have demonstrated, that God in a generality doth operate all, and in all, and then after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the self-same Unity in the Divine essence, is manifested in its property, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the multiplicity of his sacred Volunty, which is therefore proved to be manifold, because the particular effects of his actions, which are not put in execution but by his Volunty, are infinite in Variety. And for this cause I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you, that there are attributed unto one and the same sacred essence, Ten severall denominations or Attributes, whereof some send out emanations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation and extension, by the which the waters were expansed and spread abroad by subtiliation, and shaped into bright, clear, and transparent heavens: and of such kind of influences, are those which are emitted and infused into the world by HOCHMA through JAH, or by the Spirit of Wisdome; and those which spring forth from ELOAH, by the Port of TIPHERETH (which importeth beauty
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57108:107"/>
and brightnesse) into the Sun, who by dilatation doth clarifie and subtiliate the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the world, and expelleth darkness; and this action doth proceed from the center to the circumference. And contrariwise, there are other emanations, which pour out beams of attraction or contraction, as doth <hi>ELOHIM</hi> by the port <hi>Binah</hi> or <hi>Prudentia,</hi> into the globe of <hi>Saturn.</hi> By this therefore, the Spirit of God in his prudency did tie and hang the heavens, as it were lincks in a chain of gold toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and did bear up the elements in their places, and sucked or contracted the grosser part of the waters, from the circumference unto the center, and there did confirm and fix them in a dark and gross manner. So that the fountain of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive and contractive property, is in the divine Attribute <hi>ELOHIM,</hi> which for reasons that I have told you before, is the head of the northern property, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of cold, drought, opacity, congelation, incrassation, and rest, which is caused in the center, because it is the <hi>terminus ad quem, the point unto the which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction or attraction is chiefly made, beyond the which, there can be no further penetration.</hi> And for this reason, the centrall vertue which is in the bowells of the earth, doth draw and allu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This therefore is the reason, that the earth doth attract unto it the formall shapes, which descend down from above, and burieth them within its womb with delight. For heaven is affirmed by all true Philosophers and Cabalists, to be the masculine, and the earth the feminine. Neither can I but consent with <hi>Lucas Gauricus,</hi> the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logians opinion, where he saith, (as is recited before) That the star in the Tail of <hi>Ursamajor,</hi> or <hi>the great Bear,</hi> is President of the Load-stone; as also, that <hi>Saturn</hi> is the Planet which is allotted unto him; and lastly, that it hath an speciall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the Constellation of <hi>Virgo,</hi> and the rather, because <hi>Virgo</hi> is that Signe of the Zodiack, which possesseth the very self-same Longitude that the said star doth, and for that it is of an earthly, stiptick, and attractive nature, as also of the condition of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> All these reasons have been strong motives to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me, that these are principall celestiall agents, in the Northern disposition and property of this lower world, and consequently in the attractive motion of the terrestriall northern Pole, and every particular thereof.</p>

Whereby we may learn, that the earth was a thin water first, but by the breath of <hi>ELOHIM</hi> it was turned into an earthly substance, by contraction; and therefore as long as it is earth, it hath the property of that spirit, which by congelation made it earth. For by vertue of this <hi>ELOHIM Ruach,</hi> the dry land did appear out of the waters, as <hi>Moses</hi> telleth us; and every member of the world, I mean, each heaven, and each element, were tied and fastned together; so that as by the property of <hi>IAH,</hi> (which argueth the immense benignity of <hi>Ehieth,</hi> the Father of all things) namely, the emission of beams by the port <hi>Hochma,</hi> the catholick created spirit of wisdom
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57108:107"/>
did illuminate and create the waters in generall; but the division of them, which was also made by the word <hi>IAH,</hi> were fastned in formall ties by the properties of <hi>ELOHIM,</hi> or the vivifying Spirit of the Lord. And therefore <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>Verbo Domini firmati sunt coeli,</hi>

<figure/>
globe of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the fixt constellation of <hi>Virgo,</hi> whose totall attractive and retentive nature is contracted in the Pole-star, as it were the whole basis of a Pyramis, into the point of the Cone; and therefore by contraction of the dilative privative vertue, the power is the stronger; as we see, that a broad River gathered into a strait betwixt two Rocks, is the more swift and violent; or as the Bugle-maker, by blowing the whole flame into a point, maketh that point of such power, that it is able to melt glass. And these two fixt Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are assigned, as principal ministers unto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> being ordained for the distribution of his stiptick influxions, joyned with a concupiscible desire unto the neather world; and therefore the Astronomians have assigned them both all one nature, because they perform all one act, namely, that of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> as is said.

                        <p>I told you before, that the eternall Unity, everlastingly One in essence, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or transforming it self by property into Trinity, did shape out or describe ideally, the archetypicall or internall world, according unto whose example he did afterwards delineate or frame out the typicall or externall. Wherefore it must follow, that if the typicall or naturall world was framed after the idea in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall or mentall world, then what parts or properties are made evident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our capacity in this world, were also the same in the archetype; for, <hi>Quod facit tale est magis tale.</hi> There was no house that the Carpenter or Brick-layer builded, but it was first delineated in the idea of his intellect, and then drawn forth super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially in paper, and so afterward put into a solid execution; so also <hi>David</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that he had the Temple, which <hi>Solomon</hi> erected, first drawn forth ideally by Gods finger. Now when that God had in his divine counsell, thus ordered and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out an ideal world in himself, to put it in execution, and, as it were, to make it to appear unto mans sense, he emitted himself out of himself in the form of an eternall emanation, called his Image, which was his wisdom, by which the generall world, and every particular thereof, was produced according unto the ideall pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, which was in it self. This therefore being so, and being that the divine essence can no way be divided, howsoever it varieth in property, it followeth, that every particular beam which shineth out diversly from that catholick emanation, to create differing things, is one indivisible essence with the whole emanation; and therefore he is said <hi>to fill all, and to be all in all. And that the incorruptible spirit is in all things,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Wisd. 12.1. Wisd. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>and that he filleth the whole earth.</hi> I proceed therefore thus: If the created world have his shape, his members, and every particular property assigned unto it, by that formall and vivifying world, which is described and imprinted in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and all-sufficient and creating emanation; then consequently, all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, properties, and natures in this world, are graphically or curiously painted out in the supernaturall one, it remaining nevertheless one and the same in essence. And therefore as in him, the catholick image of the outward world is contained, so every beam or emanation that issueth from him, but is not divided from him, containeth the shape of the world. And for this reason, the wise Philosophers have said, That each creature enjoyeth a proportion of the great world, by which it is shaped and made in it self a little world, as shall be demonstrated by the Load-stone more plainly hereafter. And again, man is called, <hi>Omnis creatura,</hi> as he doth participate of all; so that his soul is said to be, <hi>Ad imaginemtotius sapientiae facta, omnium in se gerens similitudinem: Made after the similitude of all wisdom, bearing in it self the likeness of all things.</hi> And therefore it is tearmed of another, <hi>Omnium si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudo, The likeness of all things.</hi> And the reason is, because it is one Unity. Hereupon also it is reported, to be a certain divine and individuall substance; <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindus</hi> in his Book, <hi>de Radiis,</hi> speaking after an Astrologicall manner, seemeth to aver so much in these words,<note place="margin">

Whosoever doth comprehend the whole condition of the celestiall harmony, he may fully know the whole elementary world, with every content of the same, in every place, and at all times, as the effect by the cause. Also if he understand any thing of this world in his totall nature and condition, the celestiall disposition and condition will not be hidden from him, but will be discovered unto him, as the cause is by the effect. For every thing in this world, how little soever it be, that acteth, is the effect of the whole harmony of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> By which words, <hi>Alkindus</hi> being deeply seen in the mystery of nature, seemeth to aver, that as there is a descent from unity unto multitude, so all that multitude is in that unity as also that unity filleth all the multitude; so is 1 in 2, and 2 in 3, and 3 in 4, and 4 in 5, &amp;c. and yet that unity which is the beginning, is the end, and all in all. So light enforms the angelicall creature, the angelicall the starry creature, the starry creature the elements, and the elements the compound crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Wherefore open the compound creature, and look upon the elements, divide
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57108:108"/>
the Elements, and you shall find the starry and quintessentiall nature; open these and you shall conceive the subtill alterity of the Angelicall spirit, in which is the Divine act or immediate beam from God. In this work therefore there concurreth in the separation of the first a sensible aspect; in the other, we must behold with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall eies; So that you may observe, how all is in every thing, and every thing in all. Hereupon it was also that <hi>Hermes</hi> said, (speaking mystically and not after the common sense) <hi>Qui fornacem cum vase nostro construit, novum mundum conflat: He which maketh our furnace with the glass to it, he maketh a new world.</hi> But what needs more words, when we find all this confirmed by demonstration? For we know that the Load-stone is but a part of the Earth, and yet it hath all his Circles, and both his Poles, yea, and that very nature in all respects, between each Pole, and Circle, that the whole Earth hath, and thereupon it is termed <hi>Terrella,</hi> or a little Earth; and so may the whole earth be tearmed <hi>parvus mundus,</hi> being it containeth the Poles, circles, and astrall, yea, and Elementall natures of the great world; no otherwise then the great world doth in all those respects, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Archetype, which is carved out intellectually in the all-working Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wisdom, or sacred Emanation; yea, and we go yet deeper into our diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: For if a piece of Iron rod, which naturally aspecteth the North and South, be brok off, that small piece will have also as exactly his North and South Pole, and consequently his circles as the whole rod, and nevertheless the rod keepeth still his North and South point as before. The like in the Load-stone will happen, as experience shall hereafter make it appeare more plainly.</p>
                        <p>That we may come a little nearer to the explication of this Mystery, ye must understand that this eternall catholick Emanation, is the essentiall and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all rock, out of which, first the great world in generall, and then all particular things therein, were carved or framed by generalities: first, according unto the Ten generall Emanations and their properties, which the Ethnicks in some sort referred unto their Ten generall Predicaments; and this again had their specialities or subalternate degrees of many ranks and orders of dignities, all which were at last made apparent by the infinity of individualls, which they did in their kinds produce according unto those divers beams of the multiplicite Will or Volunty of God, which this eternall Emanation poured out into them. All which particular beams, more or lesse, being not divided in essence from the universall Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the Spirit of Wisdome, which made all things, are the spirituall Corner-stone, on which every creature as well particular as universall, doth formally or essentially consist; and this Corner-stone, is that internall essence in every thing, which as it giveth life; so also it is all and over all the things that it inacteth with life, and therefore also the soul, whose Center this Corner-stone is, is said to be in all and every part. I will leave to speak of its action in other creatures, and will onely insist on our main Subject in hand, which is the earth and her off-spring or progenie, amongst the which the feminine Load-stone, and his ferruginous mass, are chiefly reckoned. Divine Philosophy teacheth us, that the Globe of the Earth is sustained by this Corner-stone, and consequently hath her manifold Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues from it, <note place="margin">Job. 38.</note> 
                           <hi>Ubinam eras,</hi> (saith JEHOVAH) <hi>quando fundebam terram? quis disposuit mensuras ejus, aut quis extendit super eam lineam? Super quo bases ejus defixae sunt?

                        <p>Lo here an axiom of Divine Philosophy, proposed by the Creator himself, how unworthy are the Aristotelicall rules concerning the structure of the earth, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of this Divine Oracle's rudiments and doctrine, which is founded on the true Corner-stone Jesus Christ:<note place="margin">Colos. 2.8.</note> For this cause the Apostle justly biddeth us <hi>not to be deceived by Philosophy, and vain fallacies, according unto the tradition of man, and after the Elements of this world, and not according unto Christ, in whom dwelleth all the plenitude of Divinity corporally; who is the head of all Principalities and Powers.</hi> And elsewhere he giveth a reason,<note place="margin">Heb. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                              </gap>leth the whole earth.</hi> Wherefore as no essential virtue, which issueth from it, can be divided from it; So each particle of the earth must be indued more or less, with the property of the whole, being that it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all upon one spirituall line or axil-tree, (as <hi>Job</hi> seemeth to averre,) which by a twofold property, differeth according unto the two principles proceeding from the Divine Unity, namely his <hi>Nolunty</hi> or privative and contracting nature (for it operateth by a privative, contractive, cold, congealing disposition, which is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected less or more, according as it approacheth unto each Pole; that is to say, unto the North or South): and his <hi>Volunty</hi> or positive, dilative, and dissolving nature; forasmuch as this spirituall centrall Sun, doth in the middle point of the axis, emit his beams from it to the circumference, no otherwise than the celestial Sun, and his eternall Agent doth dart forth his beams from the <hi>Aequinoctial,</hi> which is the circumference of the middle point in the axil-tree towards the Poles thereof; but approacheth no nearer the Poles, then the limited Tropick of each Hemisphere. And this is the reason of that Antipathy, which is noted to be as well in the Iron as the Load-stone: For if you devide the Load-stone in the middle betwixt both his Poles, namely in his <hi>Aequinoctiall</hi>; and then afterwards, if you put the part of the middle of one Hemisphere, namely of the Northern C, unto the South Pole
<note place="margin">Look for this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment 1. Book of Dr. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</hi> c. 5.</note>
                           <figure/>
B thus, it will abhorre and fly from it, as being clean contrary in condition unto it. For the one is the seat of the dilative property, and the other is the naturall place of the contractive; the one hot, the other cold; the one attractive, by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from the Circumference unto the Center; the other expulsive by dilating of its beams from the Center to the Circumference: contrariwise the Sympathy in the Load-stone is there, where like is fitly applyed unto its like, as well in order as condition: For if you offer to joyn the <hi>Aequinoctiall</hi> of the one Hemisphere, unto that of the other, they will forthwith close and unite one with another: For, by the continuation of the spirituall Axil-tree, one Pole sucketh the Hemisphere which is next unto it, namely B draws the North Hemisphere C, A; and the North Pole C, sucketh reciprocally unto it the South Hemisphere B, A; and they both joyn in A. Also the two Poles do agree together in harmony: For the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons above mentioned; So that if you put the North Pole unto the South, they suck and draw also one another, and make a Union: Whereby each wise Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator
<figure/>
may discern the reason of Sympathy and Antipathy, in all things; as also the manner of attraction and dilatation in every creature; and how each nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth properly unto its nature, but flyeth or inclineth naturally from its contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and all proceedeth from the opposit properties in one radicall essence, as I will prove here immediatly, by a more familiar experience.</p>
                        <p>In the Weather-glass, which I have described in my precedent Philosophicall discourse, you may discerne two points, corresponding unto the two Poles, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the mattras head above, resembling the Northern Pole; and the water below, compared to the Southern Pole; the aire interposed betwixt them, unto the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57108:109"/>
heaven, or sublunary spirit, which is betwixt these two Poles, the middle of which in the figure 1. the Aequinoctiall doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ut, as being in the mid-way betwixt the two Poles. We find evermore, that when the aire, included in the top of the Mattras, or bolts-head, is cold, namely, when the northern blasts are sent forth, it will be contracted, and consequently will suck or draw up the water, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we are taught the reason of the attractive nature, not onely in the northern or septentrionall winds, but also in the Load-stone, and all other things, which by contraction of the aire do draw and suck unto them, namely, that they have that property from the power of Gods Spirit, which, by his angelicall organs doth blow from the north. By this also it is made evident, why one Pole doth suck and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the other, in the Load stone, namely, by the continuity of the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all axle-tree, which is made and animated by one corner-stone, or essentiall and centrall spirit, as is said, though of two opposite conditions, in which also it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth after many diversities of degrees: and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> tearmeth it <hi>simplex</hi> or <hi>unicus,</hi> simple, or one, in regard of his divine nature; and <hi>multiplex,</hi> in respect that it worketh and operateth after a manifold manner: for as it worketh about the poles of the axle-tree, by attracting and sucking unto it by cold and drought; so about the Aequinoctiall, and that more and more approching from the poles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Aequinoctiall, it varieth in ten thousand proportions more or less in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation, by reason of the manifold degrees of heat, which this centrall Sun of life imparteth unto the aire: And this is not onely manifested in the foresaid Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-glass, forasmuch as we find, that by how much the more the heavenly Sun, with his divine centrall agent, approacheth unto us, by so much the more the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall aire, being dilated by his heat, doth also dilate the aire, contained in the neck of the mattras, or bolts-head, and driveth down the water, that is, it repelleth back the cold of winter, which came in by showers of rain, sent from the south unto his proper pole. So that we see, as the nature of the cold pole is to draw or suck unto it by condensation, which is effected by contraction, or made by a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnine</hi> faculty, so the nature of the hot Aequinoctiall, and his adjacent parts, is to expell his opposite by dilatation, which is effected by a subtiliating heat. And this is the reason, as is already demonstrated, that the Aequinoctiall of the Load-stone detesteth to be joyned unto the pole; as on the contrary side, the pole abhorreth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally the Aequinoctiall. Also this is the reason, that in the pole of the said stone, there is so great power of attraction, and that it sucketh the iron unto it, <hi>ad angulos rectos,</hi> that is, <hi>after a perpendicular manner</hi>; and then the nearer the needle, or piece of steel, or iron-wier, approacheth unto the Aequinoctiall of the stone, the more will his obliquity in coition or conjunction be with the stone. So that when it commeth directly unto the Aequinoctiall, it will lose all angular contact, and lie flat, as it were, on its belly, as you may see by this true observation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

                        <p>But because these demonstrations may seem unto the vulgar somewhat intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, as being ignorant of the centrall sun of the earth, which the Philosophers call <hi>Archaeum naturae,</hi> or, <hi>The master-workman of nature.</hi> As also it will be difficult for them to conceive, what an axiltree of the earth may be, and what his poles. And again, the right use of the Load-stone, or practise in the Weather-glass, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known unto many a man. I will proceed unto a kind of proof and explication of this matter, which is familiar unto each person of what degree soever. It cannot be gainsaid, but that Man, and all other creatures, as well vegetable as animal, are composed of a living soul, which is internall, and a body, being his externall: The self-same also we ought to judge of the earth, for it hath an inward spirit, whereby it operateth diversly; And again, as there is no animal nor vegetable, that can exist
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57108:110"/>
without the aire, forasmuch as by it each thing liveth and existeth, by inspiration, (for by that means they suck in the celestiall influence) so also the aiery element doth feed the inward spirit of the earth, and conveyeth from above all the heavenly influences into her body, and maketh her the mother of all mineralls and vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. I told you before, that all inferiour things, with their operations, are the types or similitudes of things above; and that God did animate the Angels, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels did inform the stars, and the starry demons, or olympick spirits, send down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences unto the winds, and the winds do inform the catholick element of the aire four-foldly, that is to say, according unto the nature of the four winds; which four-fold information doth give or assigne a name unto the four elements. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the catholick aire, there is but one onely substance in essence, yet it varieth in nature after a four-fold condition, according unto the will and property of that one Spirit, which onely is the efficient actor or agent in this metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, or Protean transmutation, from one nature or form unto another, although he useth as well angelicall as starry organs; and is said, to ride upon the cherubins, and to glide upon the wings of the winds. For this reason therefore the Prophet saies,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.</note> 
                           <hi>Come, O spirit, from the four winds, and breathe upon these slain bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that they may live.</hi> He said not, Come, O spirits; but, Come, O spirit; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he argued, that it is but one Spirit which bloweth essentially from the four winds, and consequently, that this one spirit in essence, is but onely one thing, though four-fold in regard of his property; and that as in this archetypicall spirit, the whole world was ideally divided into poles and portions, distinguished by spirituall circles; so also in all the regions of the world, he observeth constantly the self-same character of position, namely, in the starry world, as in the airy; and in the airy as in the water and earth. For in the heavens, the northern pole is poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at, and marked out with the starry character, which is found in the Tail of the great <hi>Bear</hi>: in the aire it is manifested in that very point, from whence <hi>Boreas</hi> or the north-wind bloweth, which doth exactly correspond unto the pole-star. Again, that the earth observeth the very same order in the direction of her pole, is confirmed, by the conversion of the Load-stone and Iron, unto the north-star. Thus you see, that it is one onely spirit in essence, that worketh all in all. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed therefore thus to my demonstration, which is so familiar to each person, that not any one who is in his senses can deny it; for I am sure, no man can be ignorant, that when the north-wind bloweth, the aire is of nature cold and dry, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is converted into the condition and consistence of earth, namely, from a clear transparent light, subtle, dissolved, and dilated consistence of aire, into a troubled, opake or dark, gross, ponderous, and contracted substance; for experience doth teach us, that it is transmuted into snow, hail, frost, and ice; that is, from an aery spirit, unto an earthly and sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>d body; from an invisible and mobile estate, unto a visible and fixt disposition. And, in conclusion, the whole aire is changed into a spirituall and corporall earth; and this transmutation it hath from that cold, dry, and attractive form, which it borrowed from the northern wind, or septentrionall property of the divine spirit, which ordereth all things, and altereth them from one form unto another, by the breath of his nostrills, (as Scriptures allegoriously speak) or by those windy emissions, or angelicall emanations, which it sendeth from the four corners of the earth. So that by his breath from the north, he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth that property in the lower world, by the which he draweth or attracteth from the circumference unto the center, and so congealeth, inspissateth, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth soft spirits, by contraction and coarctation of those parts, which before were porous and dilated. But some will perchance reply, and say, How is it likely, that the emanation or emission of spirits, from the port of <hi>Binah,</hi> under the Attribute of ELOHIM, or the streaming forth of the breath or blasts from <hi>Boreas,</hi> and his two collateralls, can harden by contraction, or suck and draw in spirits, from the circumference unto the center, when their emissions are straight from the north southward, and make no reflexion, whereby any such motion, <hi>à circumferentia ad centrum,</hi> should be made? I answer, That this is effected after a wonderfull fashion, and worthy to be pondered by the choisest wits. We must consider therefore in the first place, that the property of the Attribute ELOHIM, was before all beginning ordained, to indue the negative or contractive nature of the eternall Unity's <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunty,</hi> namely, of darkness; for when God will not shew the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he reflecteth his light in himself, that is, he withdraweth it from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference to the center, and leaveth onely darkness unto the creatures. This
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57108:110"/>
property of God is antipatheticall unto such parts of the world, as also unto all such creatures, as have their life from a naturall heat, which heat had its beginning from Gods benevolent emanation, that is, from the act of unity, by an emissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or dilatation from the center unto the circumference, I mean, from unity into multitude. It followeth therefore, that though the emission of winds from the north be streight, yet their essentiall property, proceeding immediately from Gods angelicall organ, is contractive and attracting from the circumference unto the center, seeing that it is an emission, which, by the divine Spirits emanation and action in the nature of ELOHIM, is cold, dry, coagulative, or congealing, and apt to rest, and is therefore antipatheticall and oppugnant unto the disposition of the air, forasmuch as it is hot and moist, and consequently is animated by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative action, which the catholick spirit sendeth or breatheth out of the celestiall Sun, and other vivifying stars, as are <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> And for this cause it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that when the Boreall spirits are sent forth into the aire, it must needs succeed, that, at the antipatheticall contract of these cold spirits, the naturall heat or life of the aire flyeth, or with-draweth it self from its circumference unto its center, and so partly by that contractive motion in it self, caused <hi>per antiperistasin,</hi> or by reason of the antipatheticall occurrence, or meeting of his contrary, and partly by mingling of a new terrestriall form, it is congealed, and falleth to the earth as if it were dead, because unmovable, in the form of snow, hail, frost, and ice. In like manner we see, that the aery life in other creatures, whose formall bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing consisteth of Gods dilating property, is forced to fly from the circumference unto the center, leaving the externall parts chil, cold, and apt to a deadly congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or lethall repose, which we observe not onely in animal creatures, but also in vegetables, seeing that their blood, (as I may tearm it) or vitall suck, is congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by the winter and northern cold, and is, as it were, liveless, untill by the vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and dilative sorce of the ensuing Vernall, or Springly and Australl vertue, it is resolved and melted again, and the severe tye or icy knot of the northern nature undone. For this reason therefore you may discern, that there is but one catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick element, which is partly subject and obnoxious unto the privative and dark contracting, and consequently attracting property of Gods Spirit, and partly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to endue his positive and light dilating disposition; and that this common subject is the spirit or aire of the sublunary world, which by lesse inspissation or contraction, caused by the west winds, is made water; and by more compression and constriction, caused by the northern and winter blasts, becommeth snowy or icy earth: And contrariwise, by lesse dilatation and subtiliation, is made aery or vaporous, caused by the spring season, and south wind, and by a greater rarefaction and exaltation it is made fire, by the dominion of such spirits as are sent out from the east, and summers heat; and both these main, two-fold, divided properties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto one and the same Spirit, as is before related. Verily, this common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration can deceive no man, being that the very unreasonable creatures are moved by a naturall inclination, either to sympathize and rejoyce with the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and comfort of the one property, or to fly from or eschew the severer as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults of the other, which do antipathize with their nature. But to our main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. It is manifest by that which is already said, that the northern breath is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, attractive, inspissative, and apt to darkness, immobility, and rest; and that the south-winde, or rather the winde from the Aequinoctiall, is contrary in nature unto it, as being ready to undo all that the north winde did effect, namely, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the congealed aire, which was made snow, frost, hail, ice, into water, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into aire, to make transparent that which was dark, and render thin that which was before thick: And therefore between these properties there is no more sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, then I have shewed you to be between the Load-stones Aequinoctiall, and the Pole. And again, that both these opposite natures proceed, and spring from one and the same divine and catholick spirit, which operateth all in all, every where, and consequently as well in earth as in heaven, this testimony of the true Philosophy doth manifestly confirm and import:<note place="margin">Psal. 147.</note>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57108:111"/>
dissolveth all these; so soon as he breatheth forth his wind or Spirit, the congealed waters begin to flow and move.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that the Word or Spirit of God congealeth by one property, and dissolveth by another: and consequently as God is all one in essence; so it is one and the same Spirit that effecteth these four-fold alterations, in one catholick spirit of the world, which are by the Ancients called distinct Elements; because they cuold never as yet throughly determine, what was the essentiall form of the Elements. But if they had well considered the four Elements, of the which they spake so much, and, as it should seem, understood essentially but little, or had they well conceived that heaven and earth were made of water,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> and by water by the Word, as Sacred Philosophy teacheth us, then they would have known also, that the common substantiall Subject of them all, was but one created watery spirit; also that this spirits four-fold information, was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by one increating formall essence or Divine Word, acting and informing that universall Element by a four-fold emanation; so that the will of one creating Spirit, effected by, and working in, four Angells of an opposit nature, maketh disposeth, or changeth every day this one spirituall watery Subject into this or that Element, according unto the Will of the Creator. All which is evidently demonstrated by the wether-glass: For the aire therein inclosed, doth by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or dilatation, convert it self into the form of any of the Elements, and is altered therein, according as the nature of the Macrocosmicall blast or wind that bloweth. Now whereas it may be objectively demanded, From whence then came the earth and waters, that are resident perpetually here beneath? I answer, That they are the effects, which the winds by the Will of God or ELOHIM RUACH did originally produce, and these were framed first out of the aire, namely by thickning it by one degree into water, and ingrossing it by another into solid and fixt earth, as it appeared by the third daies Creation, where it was said, that <hi>Aridum apparuerit ex aquis: Dry-land did appear out of the waters.</hi> But the Divine Philosopher St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth confirm all this, where he affirmeth, that <hi>we ought to believe by Faith, that those things which are visible, were first of things invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and unseen.</hi> And again, if that the two lower bodies did not resolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by little and little, though insensibly into aire, it would not be possible that the earth or the water could hold that abundance of Water, Stones, Brimstone, caused of Lightnings, and such like, which falleth from the aire; and yet we see that neither the aire, nor water, nor earth, are at any time found bigger then their naturall accustomed proportions. By this therefore I have sufficiently expressed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, the attractive and contractive property of the Northern Pole in the aire; which inferreth thus much, that as the Northern blasts are enemies unto life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they contract from the circumference to the Center, which is contrary unto the act of man's life, therefore all things that are reduced into a chill, cold, and Northern property, be they airy, watery, or earthy, they draw strongly unto them, as it is proved by the weather-glass: For the included aire being animated, by the effects of a strong and obstinate Northern wind, sucketh and draweth the waters on high, namely from the <hi>Aequinoctiall</hi> point of the glass, unto the Center of the North Pole, which is assigned by the head of the mattras; and also by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son congealed spirits in any earthly substance, do suck or draw from the exteriour to the interior; as we observe that <hi>Bole Armoniack</hi> sucketh moysture unto it; and also all other earth when it is throughly dry, and that in his own naturall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely because it being of the quality of the North, it sucketh and draweth strongly a watery moysture; but this is by reason of his drought; the attraction therefore in the Load-stone is otherwise. For it having the essentiall nature of its mother Earth, and the virtue of the North in his Pole, draweth the masculine Sulphureous spirits out of Iron greedily, and that with a feminine appetite by reason of the propinquity, and likeness of one nature unto another. The like regard also hath the Pole star unto the Load-stone, as the Load-stone hath unto the Iron, which is his like: For <hi>Natura Natura suá gaudet &amp; laetatur: Nature is glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in her like nature</hi>: as <hi>Empedocles</hi> doth truly testifie. But both the Iron and the Load-stone are of one myne, one vein, and one nature, seeing that both of them are of an earthly and boreall disposition, and therefore the Load-stone and his formall included spirits, being more encombred with superfluities, then the refined Iron, doth as it were (either for their assistance, namely to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that incombrance) draw unto them their like, out of the purified Iron or Steel, by a wonderfull appetite, and in this action suck unto it the Iron,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57108:111"/>
who (as unwilling to leave its formall spirit) doth follow by a naturall continui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the motion of its formall beams, or else for comfort and consolation, yea, and formal refection's cause; no otherwise then the cold materiall female doth the more formall male, to be refreshed by the masculine seed or sulphureous Form, which they both received from that generall Agent's ideal Northern nature, that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staineth and animateth the earth. I will prove it by a similitude, but in a vegetable substance. We observe, that the grain of wheat, not participating with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the earth, that is, so long as it is above ground and not sown, attracteth not his like from heaven; but when it is committed unto the earth, and the earth by corruption hath unloosed his bands, his spirits suck down from above the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, and celestiall influences of his fixt constellation and erratick Planet in quantity; that thereby it may be delivered, and rise again by the celestiall beams of his own nature, that descend from heaven, and principally from the Sun; so that like being added to his like, becommeth the stronger in ascention: For experience teacheth us, that the celestiall included form or vitall beam creepeth out of the earth upwards, tending by all his appetite unto its ethereal native home, from whence it came; but because the Element of fire is contiguous unto the aethereal spirit, therefore it will not permit these aethereall or sunny-beams, to ascend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and because the aire is a near-cleaving and continued neighbour unto the fire, therefore it will not permit the fire to ascend without his presence: and again, the water challengeth the self-same priviledge, namely to ascend with the aire: and lastly, the earth will not let the water move upwards without her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as being next of her race, and therefore will have the self-same prerogative with the other three. But because the earth is ponderous and cannot ascend, she holdeth it fast below, and will not permit the spirit to sore higher; and so those beamy spirits which seemed to descend, for the freedom of their brethren, are by these Elementary ties, or rather the four-fold disposition of one Element detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and made to hover, and hang in the aire; where insteed of flying upwards to heaven, they do multiply into many graines. And I have noted by mine own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, namely by anatomising of corn, with the fiery knife of distillation, that the female in corn, which sucketh down the celestiall influences of the like nature, is a pure volatil Salt, of a refined or aereall terrestrial condition; but rich in cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall fire, and therefore made volatil and airy by the union of both extreames; so that it is this female, which allureth and draweth down magnetickly, beams from above, and holdeth them fast to multiply its own nature; even like the fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, that maketh use of a captived bird, to allure others of the same kind unto his netts. But as for the female mineral nature, because the body of it is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, and not corruptible; it sucketh unto it for the self-same reason, namely by the attractive virtue of his stiptick and attractive salt, the essentiall beams of Iron, as from a star of his own nature, to solace and redeem his spirits, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently with the spirit it sucketh also the masculine body; forasmuch as the one cannot be well devided from the other, and when it hath them it retaineth them; partly for a consolation and corroboration; and partly for a multiplication of his essence. And therefore those Philosophers are deceived, which averre, that the Load-stone doth not secretly feed upon the formall spirits of Iron, because though its force was preserved by immersing or burying of it in a bag of filings or scales of Iron; yet because neither the Load-stone was augmented, nor the Iron dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in waight, they conclude that it doth not nourish. But they ought to know, that the formall beams in the aire, doth adde no more waight unto it, then the light of a candle doth to the glass, or water in which it shineth; and yet it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth formally, that is, it multiplieth in formall essence, though not in materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all substance or quantity. To conclude, as the externall cold, causeth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall heat in the aire to contract it self, in flying and retiring it self, from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference unto the Center, to eschew the assaults of his adversary; so also the externall cold, doth compact it into a more solid space by an antiperistaticall rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, and contraction, caused by the Northern cold's penetration. But in the Load-stone the spirit is Saturnine, and doth not otherwise suck in his like, by the assistance also of a Saturnine body, animated by the drouth of a Martial nature, which also is by some ascribed unto the North: But moreover, it affecteth his like in the Iron, and therefore by a sympatheticall desire is the more animated unto that business of Attraction. And it should appear, besides all this, that there is an attractive property also in the body of the Iron, which sucketh unto it the spirits
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57108:112"/>
of the Loadstone, no otherwise than the male or <hi>Mars</hi> doth in his nature covet and affect <hi>Venus</hi>; but because the female, by reason of her coldness, doth most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and desire the company of the male, the spirituall beams of her affection doth with the most fervency desire and covet, and therefore draw and allu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e the beams of the male, (which is of a hotter, and for that reason of a more perfect nature) unto her; and this is observed in the Iron, which I take for the male, for though it, of it self, without the Load-stones assistance, doth convert his poles, by a naturall inclination, unto the poles of the world, yet we observe, that it is more slowly, and with the lesser appetite, and therefore more formall than materiall.</p>
                        <p>I collect therefore, upon that which is already said, that two like things, which are of the nature of the Aequinoctiall and temperate Zone, do affect and embrace one another, by a sympatheticall emission of beams, from the center unto the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference; and such is the love of those creatures, which live by the property of a positive emanation, as are animals, which are of a hot disposition, be they dry or moist; and therefore they do not sensibly draw one spirit unto another, but work by the union which is made by a conjunction, or concurrency together of lights, after an emission of their formall beams. And these have a reference unto the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits property, which issueth from the east and south winds, whose natures are to dilate from the center, and therefore not to contract from the circumference. Contrariwise, two like natures, which embrace the property of the Poles, and cold Zones, do affect and hug one another by contraction, namely, by sucking and drawing of each nature from the circumference unto their center, even as we see one Load-stone divided in the middle, will draw and suck another unto it self, till both parts of it be fitly joyned together, in the very place or equinoctiall of their division; and after this fashion also is that attractive affection made, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the iron and the Loadstone, which are creatures subject unto <hi>Saturn, V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>From these Physicall and Astronomicall assertions of ours, the Chimycall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation varieth not much; for if in that kind of speculation, we do observe the nature of the Load-stone, we shall find it not to spring from any naturall, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a monstrous birth or generation, forasmuch as it is noted to proceed from unequall and unlike parents, as the Mule doth; for if we observe well the manner of its composition, we shall finde, that his mother, or passive corporeall masse, is a common, stony, and earthly <hi>Mercury</hi>; and that his father, or active form, is a metallick, or sulphureous Martiall spirit: And, in conclusion, we shall perceive, that their mixtion is effected in this manner: The Mercuriall liquor of a stony, earthly, or Saturnine nature, being as yet in its first matter or shell, as it were, and being a near neighbour unto the <hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> (for these two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are most commonly found near, and in company one of another) did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and for this cause, acquire unto it self, a light transmutation, and so do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be joyned together by a streight, contiguous, and almost continued union; so that the composition doth obtain a mean existence, between the nature of a Martiall mettle, and a Saturnine stone, and may well be tearmed a <hi>Mercury,</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosed by halves, or a kind of a Hermophroditicall Saturnine-<hi>Mercury</hi>; into the which, when the Sulphureous Martiall spirits, as the metallick form, do enter, it receiveth those Martiall spirits, and conserveth them in its womb, as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per passive and mother; and by that means, the mass is coagulated into a stony body.</p>
                        <p>Now since every spirit, and consequently this of the Load-stone, desireth to be nourished by that which is nearest and likest unto his own nature, the which nature or spirit is onely found in Iron, it happeneth for this reason, that the inward martiall spirit of the Load-stone, doth draw the body of Iron unto it, and after an occult manner, doth seem to suck his nourishment out of it; I conceive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the fixt salt in the Iron or Load-stone, is partly of a hot and dry Martiall nature, and consequently of a fiery earthly condition; and partly of a cold and dry, stiptick, and Saturnine faculty, which also it receiveth from its earth; and therefore there concurreth two testimonies of strange attraction in the Load-stone. And because <hi>Venus</hi> is said to be the female friend, and companion unto <hi>Mars,</hi> she doth add a strong concupiscible desire unto the attraction, and bridleth the irascible and odible property in <hi>Mars,</hi> by her feminine embraces. If we look seriously into the inward nature of Iron, or steel, we shall find all this to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested by effect, for I have with a certain familiar <hi>Menstruum,</hi> reduced all the body
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57108:112"/>
of Steel into a kind of Copperis or Vitriol, which nature of minerall salt is fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with, as well to Copper as Iron; for Vitriol is by the same reason extracted out of Copper. Now we shall find in Vitriol or Copperis, a hot burning corrosive nature, and an earthy attracting sulphur, which sucketh unto it as <hi>Bole Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,</hi> or <hi>Terra Sigillata</hi> doth moisture: whereby it is evident, that as well a Martiall and Saturnine, as Venerian condition, concur in the magneticall or ferruginous salt. Again, we shall find, that the influxions of <hi>Mars</hi> do mingle themselves na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally with the northern wind, and agree well with the nature of the earth, by reason that in the circulation of elements, the earth doth, in regard of her siccity, consent and sympathize with the fire. Again, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> doth ascribe those Aquilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary winds, which are violent, unto <hi>Mars</hi> his influences; moreover, that <hi>Mars</hi> his spirit is the cause of the attractive vertue, in each corrosive salt, and gum that is subject unto it, it is well manifested in <hi>Euphorbium, Scamony, Laureola, Flammula,</hi> and hot corrosive Venomes; for these (as <hi>Hermes</hi> telleth us) are subject unto <hi>Mars</hi> his Constellation. Hereupon we finde, that Vitriol is cold, acid, and stiptick in his externall; and yet hot, caustick, and corrosive in his interiour. And again, Iron (which is called <hi>Mars,</hi> because it is subject unto <hi>Mars</hi> his influences) is Vitriol or Copperis in his interiour; as also Copper, (which is a minerall subject unto the Constellation of <hi>Venus</hi> and therefore is called <hi>Venus.</hi>)</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the excellency of Man in the Animal Kingdom, and of the admirable nature of the Load-stone in the Mineral.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I May well presume to compare the Load-stone in disposition with Man, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the admirable vertues and dignity of the one in the Animal kingdom; and the miraculous operations, and mysticall properties of the other, in the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral region. As for Man, (for dignities cause I will speak of him in the first place) there is such a super-eminent and wonderfull treasure hidden in him, that wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have esteemed, that the perfect wisdom of this world, consisteth in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a mans self, namely, to find out that secret mystery, which doth lurk within him. For man is said to be the center of every creature, and for that cause he is called <hi>Microcosmus,</hi> or the little world: <hi>Centrum &amp; miraculum mundi, The center or miracle of the world,</hi> containing in himself the properties of all creatures, as well celestiall as terrestriall, and consequently of the Load-stone. He is <hi>Templum Dei, the Temple of God; Corpus Christi, the Body of Christ; Habitaculum Spiritus sancti, the Habitacle of the holy Ghost,</hi> (as the Apostle hath taught us). Neither verily may it be imagined, that God would make choice of an unworthy dwelling place. And therefore in the consideration thereof, and our enquiry after so great a mystery, we had need to proceed with our exactest discretion and judgment, from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible things of man unto the invisible, that is, to penetrate with the sharpest edge of our wit by demonstration, <hi>à posteriori</hi>; or from the externall man, into the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells of his secret, mysticall, and internall beeing; wherefore we proceed thus: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Man is rightly reported by <hi>Hermes</hi> to be the Son of the world, as the world is the Son of God, being that it is framed after the image of the Archetype, (for which cause he is tearmed the little world) It will be requisite to understand, that he is in like manner divided into a heaven and earth, as the great world was, and consequently containeth in it self no otherwise his heavens, circles, poles, and stars, than the great world doth. And also as we find, that the spirituall image of the heavens, with their circles and poles, are delineated also in the earth, and every particular thereof, (as it appeareth in the Loadstone and Iron) so the character of the inward man is deciphered and pourtrayed out in the outward man, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, than we may judge of the fashion of the sword by the scabbard, or the kernell by the shell. Concerning the re-search or enquiry after the worlds poles in man, there hath risen no small difference amongst the Philosophers; <hi>Pythagoraes, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> have ordained the east part of the world to be his right hand, and their reason is, because the diurnall motion of the heavens, which proceedeth from the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> is effected from east to west; and consequently the west must be his left hand, or sinister portion: and in placing man according unto this posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his face must look unto the north, and his posteriors unto the south. But
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57108:113"/>
                           <hi>Empedocles</hi> opposeth this opinion, affirming, that the Aestivall Solstice, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> is the right hand of the world; it followeth therefore, that the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emall station of the Sun, or the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> must be the left; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto this direction, man's face must behold the west. As for mine own part, mine opinion is adverse unto both their minds, forasmuch as I, being moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for reasons, as well Theologicall as Naturall, would rather adapt mans face un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Orient, or eastern quarter, and then his posteriors shall respect the west, and so the north pole will correspond unto his left hand, and the south unto his right. That this position is not onely naturally, but also divinely, befitting the Microcosm, we prove it thus: The Patriarcks, Prophets, and Apostles, in their devoutest prayers, did use to convert their faces unto the east, which is an argument, that this quarter of the world was by the Creator alloted unto mans anteriour part. And in <hi>Matthew</hi> we read,<note place="margin">Matth. 14. Numb. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whence it appeareth, (and that, as I think, without further controversy) that the direct disposition of man, according unto the situation of the great world, is, when his face is disposed unto the orient, or east angle of the earth. And for this reason are the two eyes of man disposed in the frontispice of his fabrick, as also of all other creatures, that they might after a long nocturnall darknesse, behold with delight the orientall Sun, that by the presence thereof, they might adore the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator thereof, in whose power it is, by his golden aspect, to banish the presence of the gloomy night, and consequently to salute it, as being the visible type of the eternall Sun's invisible beauty; who also (as Scriptures hath taught us) will appear at the last day from that easterly point, to renovate and purifie by fire the corrupt world. If followeth therefore, that mans right hand, or right part, must respect the south, as his left hand the north. All which are by so much the more apparent, by how much they agree and concord with Philosophicall reason: For the Liver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the right side of man, doth most conveniently sympathise with the southern nature, being that it engendereth by its vertue warm aery blood, and sendeth it forth by the channells of the veins, every where, over the microcosmicall earth, to make it to vegetate, even as the southern wind produceth tepid or madid showers, to water the microcosmicall earth, that thereby the plants and he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>bage which groweth on it, may encrease and multiply by vegetation. The left side, or left hand, is rightly compared unto the worlds Boreal quarter, or the Arctick p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>le: for as in that angle, the aire, water, or earth, is cold and dry, apt to congelation, &amp; of a contractive and stiptick, or restrictive nature; so also we find, that the spleen which lyeth in the left part of mans body, is the receptacle of melancholy, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed, cold, black, sowre, and earthly humours; and as the northern blasts of the macro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap>, namely, of joy, mirth, and gladness, which the beauteous sun-shine of life procureth unto man, it bringeth forth dark passions, as are, sadness, fear, dispair, and such like; yea, and causeth the heart to suffer the effects of syncopes, and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitations. Thus therefore you see the two opposite poles of the little world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to concur in effect, and that in all respects, with that of the great world, counting the southern pole from the Aequinoctiall. For if we divide the Load-stone in the middle, that part in the Aequinoctiall which is next the north-pole, will serve and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57108:113"/>
stand in place of the South Pole; and if again, that half be divided in the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> the division about the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> will be his South Pole. But to look more internally yet into the little world, we find that it consisteth on that spirituall Corner-stone, by which the world was made and the earth sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and consequently in which the world, and every point thereof, was ideally delineated from the beginning, before it was made after the manner of the earth, which is said to be full of the Spirit of Wisdom. Hereupon it is termed the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, the body and members of Christ, and the habitacle of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, (as is said before). For this cause therefore we must think, that there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Poles, circles, and starrs, assigned unto man, as well spirituall as corporall, no otherwise then there is unto the earth, and every Magneticall portion thereof; So that in man is the properties of the Macrocosmicall winds, and consequently in it may passions be bred, and produced, which are as well Antipatheticall as Sympatheticall.</p>
                        <p>Now verily, if in the second place, we shall duly observe the nature of the Load-stone, we shall not a little admire at the rare and singular properties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; yea truly, we shall find it almost to passe man's reason and understanding, that a hard mineral stone, unmoveable, and stupid, should neverthelesse be possessor of such spirits, which are able insensibly to display and transmit their occult fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and virtues, quite through or a travers the hardest stones, the most solid and closest grained wood; the thick and intranspirable plates of mettal; yea, the impenetrable glass it self, and other such compacted stuffe, which have not any sensible Spiracle or porosity, and that it should work on it self, and on Iron; and that it should behold the Pole Arctick at so long a distance, as there cannot be a greater in our regard, namely from the earth unto the highest heavens, or the eighth Shpere, the which is almost incommensurable, I mean unto the Pole-star. I dare boldly say, that all the Schoole of the Peripateticks, who made profession to give a reason of all things, and to be ignorant of nothing, that toucheth the most oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and intimate secrets of nature, would find themselves much troubled and puzzeled, and as it were inclosed in a confused Labyrinth of phantasticall ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and Chimerian surmises, before they could discusse and unvaile this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty business, or unrip the fardill of so profound a riddle; that is to say, ere they could hit the mark, or attain unto the wished end of this inquirie, which is onely pointed at and demonstrated by the finger of a far truer, and diviner Philosophy, whose main Subject of all actions and power, is the spirituall Corner-stone Jesus Christ, in whom is the plenitude of Divinity, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us. Is it not wonderfull, that this spirit can pass like that celestiall one in Man, where the aire is not able to penetrate? Is it not an evident Argument, that it is of an aethereall race, which is able to operate these effects quite through such solid bodies? Wherefore let not <hi>Plutarch</hi> make his brags as he hath done, where he striveth to undo this intricate Gordian knot or tye, reputing it a shame and defect in such lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, as have medled herein, and have not dived into the depth thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that at last he himself sheweth palpably herein his error, after he had made so strict an inquisition: For he concludeth, that the insensible emanations or emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or effluxions which issue out of the Load-stone, and produce his attractive effects, are gross and flatuous; whereas, if he had a little better considered the businesse, he would have found that the subtilest, and most rarified aire, is not able to find any porosity or spiracle to breathe through thick compacted boards, or smoothed and polished stones, or plates of silver and gold; much less can any pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage be admitted unto gross and flatuous spirits, to breathe or expire through. But to return again unto the straight line of our History.</p>

                           <p>Of a double attractive disposition in Man; and how the one agreeth with the nature of the Load-stone; and the other is different from it. Herein also the Reason, why the dead carcass of a Man is indued with a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick power or attractive nature, is discovered.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AS in the dimension of the Load-stone, there is observed to be a multiplicity in kinds or manners of attraction, (for the attraction of it is otherwise ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57108:114"/>
at his Poles, namely perpendicularly, than it is on the <hi>Aequinoctial,</hi> which is flatling; so also there is a great difference between the attraction, which is made in man: For the Spleen being of the property of the North Pole, sucketh unto it by the <hi>Ramus Splenicus</hi> his like, namely Melancholly or terrestriall juices, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a Saturnine virtue, and the Gall attracteth, by a Martiall Sulphureous or fiery terrestriety, choller unto it; and the Liver by a Southern or Aequinoctial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation, disperseth the blood which it hath rubified, by veiny channells through the whole Microcosmicall earth. But first, it attracteth by his porous Organs the like unto it from the guts. All which manner of attraction it would never effect, were it not by the incitation of naturall heat, which though in it self it rather dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipateth by dilatation, then attracteth by contraction; yet it inciteth and anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth certain corporeall instruments, ordained by nature for attraction's cause, namely to draw and suck by contraction, and to dilate again by relaxing or dilating of themselves. And for this reason is the Heart, the Stomack, the Intestines, or Guts, the Veins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made or compacted of fibers direct for attraction, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse for retention, and oblique for expulsion. Again, the attraction of the aire by the <hi>Aspera Arteria</hi> and nostrills, could not be effected, but by the aid of the Pulmones or Lungs, the which would not move or work but by the animation of a dilating and vivifying heat; so that, in this case, all attraction of externall aire, which is made by the Pores, into the fleshy parts, and by the Lungs into the Heart, and by the nostrils into the brain, proceedeth from the dilatated action of heat, and is effected by instruments, and that properly by the lungs and heart: Even as we see that the Syringe or Squirt being pulled out, attracteth or draweth aire; but being thrust in, it emitteth or expelleth it again; and yet both these opposit actions in one Organ or instrument, proceed from one dilated humane spirit which acteth. We must understand therefore, (as I have expressed before) that man is composed of Matter which is his Patient, and Form which is his Agent; and as matter did first proceed of the watery Subject, which did issue out of the dark Chaos, and therefore is of it self inclinable unto a Northern and privative disposition, namely to rest, cold, mortification, and immobility; so it is this Matter, that maketh contraction, as well in the heart, and consequently in the Pulse's motion, as in the other parts of the body; that is to say, the naturall inclination of Matter in man, is apt to contract spirits from the Circumference unto the Center; when contrariwise Form being derived from Light, is busie in dilatation, and therefore in animation, and exagitation of Matter, which would otherwise be sopified, and as it were mortified, by her mother's Northern cold. And this is the reason of <hi>Systole</hi> and <hi>Diastole,</hi> in the hearts motion, which commeth of that action and passion, or operation and resistence, which is made between the Light, heat, or Aequinoctial form, and the dark and cold, or polar matter in man's composition; whereby it is apparent, that as the great world is said to be composed <hi>ex lite et am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, of hatred and friendship</hi>; so also the little world, is rightly averred to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted of contraries, namely of the children of Light and Darknesse. Now in this therefore, a live-man's attractive power, differeth from that of the Load-stone, because the Load-stone is not so appearing lively as man is; but may in some sort be esteemed dead, because it is divided from his ferruginous vein in the earth; and again, he attracteth not by any dilatation, made of a vivifying heat, through any organicall Substance or assistance, but by an earthly and Centrall, contracting dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. And for that reason, his greatest power of attraction consisteth in the Pole. The live man's attraction proceedeth therefore from a dilatation of lively heat, from the Center unto the circumference, which causeth materiall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ordained as well for attraction as retention or expulsion to effect their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and yet sometimes it operateth chiefly to contraction, that is in motion from the circumfere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ne unto the Center, when it receiveth by the permission of God the beams of a privative Emanation, as when the heart is contracted: whereupon bad passions, as sadness, melancholy, dispair, envy, fear, and such like do follow, as we have told you before. Sometimes the naturall heat reflecteth, for the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses repose and rest, his beams inwardly, as in the action of sleep, which is a type of death and darkness: but contrariwise, it dilateth its self from the Center unto the circumference, when it will have the animal spirits to watch and operate in their functions.</p>
                        <p>By this therefore we may imagine, that the Load-stone's attractive nature is from the circumference unto the Center, being as it were to man's externall view
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57108:114"/>
half dead, and by that manner of attraction it draweth unto it his like, namely spirits out of the Iron or steel, which by reason of its refination and homogeniety in nature, as being cleared from all his stony <hi>Mercury,</hi> which was heterogenious unto it, we may compare unto a live man, which is replenished with lively ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating or dilating spirits: For I would have every man to know, that there is not a creature on the earth, which hath not his Astrological or starry influence, which (though we cannot discern it) doth shine forth, and maketh his aspect unto the like of his kind, namely unto such creatures, as are of condition with the starrs of heaven, from whence the creature's influence doth descend: But if the two crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be dissonant in nature, then the one doth Antipathetically divert or reflect his beams from the other. The Iron therefore like a vivified mass, meeting with the Load-stone, doth easily emit his beams of love unto the Load-stone, who doth as greedily suck or draw them, by means of his inward earthly Martial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, even unto her Center, and by the attraction of the Iron's formall beams, draweth with it all the Iron body, that possesseth the starry or Martial influence. In like manner a strong Magnet, is as it were a female unto a weaker. No otherwise is it with a live man, and the dead carcass of another; For though that many bodies appear to be dead, yet shall the naturall Magician know, that in his flesh and bones there abideth admirable spirits, which operate no less wonders, yea, and far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then those of the Load-stone. And therefore I would have each self-concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted person, that are so apt to envy against the Mysteries of God in nature, to learn more discretion and experience, before they so vain-gloriously do judge the strange, and marvellous effects of man's royall nature, and pronounce so boldly without hesitation, or sticking, that there are no spirits in any amputated mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or portion in man, no nor in the dead carcass, as <hi>Casman</hi> and <hi>Foster</hi> aver: Nay that the Devill himself can not conferre any into them or it: For I would have both them and other temerarious and bold Judges to know, that as the Load-stone, though appearing a dead mass, is observed to suck and draw Centrally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, with a lively appetite the beams and body of the Load-stone; and that all and every member divided from the Load stone, will do the like in its proportion: Even so I can prove it, and confirm it by an ocular demonstration, that by a right application of the fleshy parts of a dead man's carcass unto a live man, (if the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication be long) it will make the live man faint and feeble, the which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a while after the materiall or corporall Magneticall Mummy be removed, will receive again his wonted strength: Moreover, lest this relation may seem to Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> and the rest of his Cabalisticall Sect, a figment or Chimerious fancy: forasmuch as he may alleadge, that the application of the thing may work in the live man's imagination, and cause him to perswade himself that he is faint, and that without any true ground, and that there can be no externall effect to prove it. I answer: That it will suck or draw forth of the live man the spirituall Mummy in a visible manner: For by the coldness of the part, the spirituall Mummy so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, will condense it self on the superficies of the corporall Magnet, even as aire into a cloud, or a cloud into Manna; so that it may be gathered and converted into a very pretious and wholsome <hi>Panacaea</hi> or generall medicine (if the party out of which it is extracted, be sound, and of a wholsome complexion)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it may prove as corrupt and Antipatheticall a medicine, where the body out of which it is drawn is infected with any venomous or contagious disease, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly French Pox, Plague, Leprosie, and such like, as shall be more at large expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the next book. Now the reason of this act and operation in the dead man's Magnetick parts, is, that as when the body was alive, it was animated by light, and enjoyed all the properties of light, to wit, it was hot, active, moveable, dilative, and, in conclusion, of an Aequinoctiall or Southern condition; so that naturall fire being extinguished, it indueth the properties of darkness; for it is mortified by cold, and is congealed, potentiall, fix or immobil, contractive, and, in fine, of the rigid zone's, and frozen Pole's nature; So that whereas before whilst it lived, it did emit his beams from the Center to the Circumference, and did enjoy the blessings of God's vivifying and positive Emanation, now it indueth the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his contracting, privative and mortifying Emanation. And yet I would not that wisemen should think, that because the lively body is turned into a dead carcass, therefore it is void of all spirits of life, being that Scriptures confirm, that the incorruptible spirit is in all things, and consequently as well in those that are dead, as in those that are alive: For this incorruptible spirit according unto the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57108:115"/>
variety of his property in the four winds, is sometime in motion from the center of the thing in which it is, unto the circumference, for so he vivifyeth, and causeth the creature to act and live, by a southern or aequinoctiall faculty; so (I say) it operateth from the center of the celestiall sun, to the animation of inferiour crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, namely, by evocation of their incorruptible spirits, (which were repelled by the winter or Boreal cold into their center) from their center unto their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, as it appeareth by such vegetables, which seem, for that reason, as it were dead all the winter season, because the spirit of life leaves and forsakes the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the plant, and betaketh it self unto the center, to retire from the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults of cold, which is its opposite, as far as it can. But when it perceiveth its fountain of light to approach, and to send them forth succours, they begin by little and little to spring again, from their center unto their circumference; and being united unto the externall beams which are come unto their aide, they expel dark privation, and congealing cold, from out their tabernacles, and do proceed to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and act unto vegetation and multiplication; as also we see in the corn which is buried in the earth. Even so, (I say) and no otherwise, the Load-stone's Martiall nature being originally, by a Saturnine spirit, contracted into his center, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agitated and stirred up, and with like joy doth suck unto it the formall beams of the Iron, from whose Martiall sulphureous spirit they did originally spring. And even so also, the spirits of the dead body being by mortifying cold driven from the circumference unto the center, and resting there at repose without any action, maketh the body and every part thereof fixt and unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable; but when they are applyed unto the lively circumference of their species or kind, they spring forthwith and in their watery spirits towards the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, (as if they were almost famished in the center) and rejoyce to meet with their like in the live man, which doth, as it were, dilate it self, and issue forth of the pores in a streaming manner, for their assistance; and they being partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed in the center of the dead member, do with a greedy appetite suck them in with the spirituall Mummy, which is their vehicle, towards their centrall abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to endue it with life as it was before, and to recreate it with their presence; but the unctuous spirituall Mummy, being full of bright spirits, resting upon the superficies of the live man, inspissated with the cold and mortifying contact of the dead flesh, or part of the carcase, is forthwith congealed, and may be reserved for a private use. But can we (I pray you) better confirm this, than with the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, restrictive, or congelative vertue of the fumous excrescence, issuing from the salt contained in the dead mans bones? for by applying it, I mean, the Uznea or masse, which groweth on the dead mans bones, unto the irruptions of blood or haemorrhoigy in a living man, the warm blood, as it were, moved by an antipathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall affection, returneth back again, and is denyed passage by the congealing and binding operation, of these northern effected excrescences.</p>
                        <p>But leaving these conclusions, touching the dead mans magnet and its vertues, for a while, what will you say, and there may be a microcosmicall Magnes or Load-stone, which may be selected and gathered out of the living man, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment or prejudice unto his life, whose vertues, both in regard of its monstrous and unnaturall generation, being composed of unlike parents, and being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of two substances different in kinde, as the Mule is, namely, of an earthly Mercury, and cholerick sulphureous human spirits; as also in his manner of attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the spirituall Mummy out of the living man; yea, and what is far more admirable, by the transplantation of it, either to the animal or vegetable kinds, it worketh after a strange fashion, either sympathetically or antipathetically. I know, that these newes will streight way be esteemed by some, who are apter to judge amiss, than rightly to scan, to be diabolicall: And why? Marry because they passe the sphear of their capacities. And yet I know this to be true, and know them which have put it in execution, not without the wonderment of many; yea, I know this Microcosmicall Magnet, and the use thereof, the which when it is tryed by wise-men, and well pondered by them, will appear as naturall, as the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will seem strange, and the reason abstruse. But if that which I have said before be well understood, and seriously pondered, the cause hereof will not seem so hidden, as that it should exceed the limits of nature. Of this kind of magneticall action, as well sympatheticall as antipatheticall, I purpose, by Gods grace, to discourse more at large, in the third or last Book of this Treatise or History.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Foster</hi> hath sufficiently expressed the shallowness of his Philosophy, where he averreth, That because the light of the Sun and Stars cannot penetrate the thick clowds, and opake bodies; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the formall essence of a man is not able to pierce and penetrate directly in his course, without being stopped or hindred by Castles, Hills, Woods, and such like. But had he been a little more profoundly seen, or immersed in the bowels of true Philosophy, he would have known, that the Etheriall sperm, or Astralicall influences, are of a far subtiler condition, than is the vehicle of visible light: Yea verily, they are so thin, so mobile, so penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and so lively, that they are able, and also do continually penetrate, and that without any manifest obstacle or resistance, even unto the center or inward bosom of the earth, where they generate mettals of sundry kinds, according unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the influence, as the antient Philosophers do justifie. The subtlety therefore of this spirit, <hi>Plotinus,</hi> according unto <hi>Plato</hi>'s minde, doth fully expresse in these words, <hi>Tanta est Aetheris tenuitas ut omnia corpora penetret universi tam su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera quam infera, &amp; cum ipsis conjunctus aut implicitus, ea major a minime reddat, quia spiritus iste interior cuncta opera eorum mole minima nullum prorsus augmentum reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piente, alit atque conservat. The tenuity of the Aether is such, that it doth penetrate all the bodies of the world, as well above in heaven, as below on earth; and this heavenly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance being joyned and mixed with them, it maketh them not a jot the bigger for all that, because this inward spirit doth nourish and preserve all bodies, without adding any thing unto their weight, or encreasing of their substance.</hi> And by reason of this heavenly natures purity or subtlety, the heaven, or <hi>coelum,</hi> is called by the wiser Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and mysticall Poets, the Husband unto the earth, which they tearm <hi>Vesta</hi>; yea, and the very stars of heaven, among the which the Copernicans ranck the earth, are likened unto his wife, being that they are extracted out of the aetheriall substance, no otherwise than <hi>Eve</hi> was out of the side of <hi>Adam</hi>; for they are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be the thickest portions of their orbs, by reason whereof, they are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the members of heaven, and consequently there is nothing so thin, subtle, and piercing, as is that spirit from whence by condensation they are derived. This is the cause, that the true Alchymists do tell such wonders of their <hi>Coelum,</hi> which they call their <hi>Quintessence,</hi> arguing, that by reason of its purity and subtlety, it is able to penetrate all things. And the Philosophers say, that it is their nature, which they define to be,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>De Arte Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>Vis quaedam rebus infinita, omnia permeans entia, cunctas ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerans res, easque augens alensque &amp; ex similibus similia procreans. A certain infinite power in things, which penetrateth and passeth through all things, ingendring every thing, and augmenting and nourishing them, and procreating like things of their like.</hi> And verily, if you will be pleased to consider really what I have spoken before, you will remember how I told you, that the angelicall vertue proceeded from the archetypicall emanations, and are the types of the divine Idea. Again, that the aetheriall spirit was filled with the angelicall influences, which had their essentiall root from God. So that in verity, it is not the starry light which penetrateth so deeply, or operateth so universally, but that eternall centrall spirit, with which his divine and unresistable essence, penetrateth all things, both in heaven above, and in the earth and waters beneath. And all this the mysticall Philosophers see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to verifie, though darkly, when they called <hi>Saturn,</hi> which was the father also of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or the head of the catholick emanation, the father of <hi>Coelum,</hi> or Heaven, arguing thereby, that in the emission of the spirit of wisdom, he produced created, or informed the heavens, according to that of <hi>Job, Coelum ornasti Spiritu tuo, Thou didst adorn the heavens by thy Spirit.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Job. Psalm.</note> And <hi>David, Verbo Domini fimati sunt coeli &amp; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu ab ore ejus omnis virtus eorum: By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by his Spirit each vertue thereof.</hi>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57108:116"/>
immediate vehicle of so unresistible and emanating influence must be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it in purity and subtility which is the informer, who is said by the wise <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to be <hi>Omni re mobilior &amp; subtilior &amp; attingere ubique propter suam munditiam,</hi>

                           <hi>&amp; innovare omnia &amp; implere orbem terrarum: To be the most active and moveable and subtill of all things, and to penetrate and pass everywhere, by reason of his purity in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and to renew and refresh all things, and to fill the earth with his presence.</hi> This therefore was it that made some,<note place="margin">Wisd. 1.</note> even of our Christian Philosophers, to break forth into these speeches: <hi>Deus est Natura, &amp; Natura Deus: God is Nature, and Nature is God.</hi> Whereby they ment, that the naturating or radicall informing nature, was the eternall emanation, which made and informed the humid nature of the world; which for that reason was called <hi>Natura naturata, or the Nature which was made naturall,</hi> namely by the presence of the Naturating nature or Spirit of the Lord, which moved upon the waters, and imparted unto them of his fiery informing Vigor or Essence, as we may find partly by Sacred Testimony, and partly by the confirmation of St. <hi>Austin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We must therefore after a due consideration of this which is said, infer, that if the influence be compleatly animated by the incorruptible Spirit of the Lord, then must it be indued with the properties of that Spirit or Divine Nature, and consequently it must be the most subtill, quick, movable and penetrating of all spirits, and in that respect will be able to pass through all solid bodies without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, and also to ingender, augment, and nourish all things; and being incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated or specificated, it procreateth like individualities of their like; and again, it hath in regard of our capacity, an infinite extension, and therefore cannot be limited. All which I purpose by experience or ocular demonstration, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate in this manner. We find in practice, that the Load-stone by virtue of his subtill spirit, which doth internally animate it, is made so potent through it, in his attractive virtue, that it is able without resistance to display and transmit the beams of his active virtue quite atravers the hardest stones, the most solid and finest grained wood, through thick plates, copper, tin, silver, or gold: yea, and to penetrate quite through the impenetrable glass it self, and other such like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted stuff, which have no sensible porosity or spiracle, which is an evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that this spirit is of a far more peircing and subtill nature, than the sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary aire: forasmuch as it is denied passage through the slightest paper-skin or blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In the like manner man's inward or celestiall spirit, which is the vehicle of this vivifying beam, is so subtil in it self, that nothing is able to resist it, when the inward mentall beam doth aime at any mark, how far or how inaccessible soever it may be esteemed in the fleshly mans conceit. For being this celestiall or aethereall spirit in man, is made after the pattern of the Divine Image which it beareth, it must also resemble it in its actions. Now the subtilty of the Divine act in man's spirit,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pimand.</hi> 4.</note> is expressed by <hi>Hermes,</hi> in these words: <hi>Quicunque hac Dei Naturà fulti sunt, intelligentià suâ cunctà complectuntur quae in terra sunt, &amp; in mari, &amp; siquid est praeter ea supra coelum, atque adeo scipsos erigunt ut ipsum quoque bonum intue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur: Who soever do rely on this Divine Nature, may comprehend by their understanding all thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now as we
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57108:116"/>
see that every Astrall influence in the creature doth by a naturall inclination, and that Sympathetically, aspect the star or celestiall Fountain from which it did spring; and likewise that star in heaven, by a paternall respect, doth send down his influences to feed and nourish his like filiall fire or form in the creature here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and both of them by a mutuall relation do rejoyce together at the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall presence of each other, (whereupon it is said: <hi>Naturá natura laetatur &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam continet; O natura coelestis veritatis, naturas Dei nutu multiplicans: Nature is rejoyced in nature, and containeth nature; O celestiall nature which by the Will of God doth mul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ply natures,</hi>) so likewise each kind or species which is indued with all one influence, doth, because of his likness to another, send forth by a sympatheticall consent, beams of one nature, making an harmonious Symphony in the concourse of their beams, by which they do agree in union of love. And for this reason the axiom of the Philosophers before mentioned runneth in this strain, <hi>Natura ex si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milibus similia procreare solet: Nature doth use to procreate like of like.</hi> And this is the cause why each specifick Form doth rejoyce in its like, and is ready to produce his kind, and doth not use to passe the limits of his kind, as for example: A Man's nature produceth a Man, a Horse a Horse, a fenel-seed fenel, a bean a bean, wheat produceth wheat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And also the nature of each thing so created is most amiable unto the nature of his like, and sendeth forth the amiable and Sympathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall beams of his affection, to concurre with the like beams, which are emitted from his like; so that both of them do easily consent and rejoyce at each other, and by contraction of beams, they indeavour to cause a union: For this reason therefore the Load-stone rejoyceth at the aspect of its like; for if one Load-stone meeteth with another, each will aspect the other by their Saturnine Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous spirits, and embrace each other: For by their applications, they will Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trally suck and draw the one to the other, with a Sympatheticall imbracing. Also because that the Iron is subject unto the self-same constellation, and hath his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall star in all points correspondent unto the Load-stone, (for which essentiall consanguinity, they are both found in the self-same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>errestriall vein, therefore they both are observed so lovingly to entertain and hug one another: For experience telleth us, that the feminine Load-stone above all measure embraceth as a luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous harlot the masculine Iron, and not the Iron the Load-stone, as <hi>Averroes, Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger,</hi> and <hi>Cusanus</hi> the Cardinall, have erroneously surmised; affirming that the Iron moveth unto the Load-stone, as unto his beginning and matrix from whence it came: for, by that reason, the North Pole in the Iron should move of it self more swiftly unto the Pole-starr, which is the fountain of both their Centrall influences, than the Magnet: all which is by experience proved quite contrary.</p>
                        <p>Now to confirm the infinity of the extension of these Centrall beams in two like bodies unto one another, let us first be capable of some Theory, that we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the better descend unto Practice. <hi>Radius</hi> (saith <hi>Alkindus</hi>) <hi>quia centro stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae ad centrum terrae procedit fortissimus esse probatur in operationis suae specie:</hi>

But forsooth, our externall Philosophers, which will onely be guided by their sense, do dream of a certain limited sphear of activity, and do ascribe bounds unto the action of this mysticall nature, as they please, or according unto their exterior sense's observation: As for example, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Load-stone draweth the Iron but at half the distance of a table, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they think and conclude, that the vivifying act of his vertue penetrateth or exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it self no farther, than at that distance in the aire, and consequently being led by their corporall eye-sight, they limit, after this externall and visible action, the Load stones spirituall extension. But if they would duely close their corporall eyes in this inquisition, and look, as true Philosophers ought, in the re-search of so abstruse an action, with the aspect of their mentall intellect, they would find, that the extension of the beamy spirit in the Load-stone, doth equalize that of his proper celestiall star, being that they are both of one essence; as also is the like spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the Iron, and every scintill or spark of fire hath the properties of the whole, as is said of the Load-stone. But there are many things, which may hinder the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent effect in the Load-stone, namely, the ponderosity of the body of the Iron, and therefore it will not draw it beyond the circle of his sensible emanation; and another thing is the dispersing and dilating of the union of beams in the Load-stone: for the beams, after they are emitted, are the more dispersed the farther they pass, as it appeareth by this demonst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

is upon the Iron, for which cause it attracteth its spirits forcibly, because, <hi>vis unita est fortior.</hi> But when the Iron is planted at a further distance, namely, in <hi>C,</hi> the greatest portion of the basis of the spirituall triangular-emission, passeth by the Iron, without any streight encounter, and so his effect or vertue is made too weak, to draw so ponderous a thing at so far a distance. But because his celestiall star doth meet and embrace his emissions, and doth fortifie them, therefore it is evident, that the pole-star doth act in the Load-stone, to stir up and animate his like vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in it; and the Load-stone being so vivified, doth correspond unto the action of the star, penetrating, by all one sympatheticall and symphoniacall consent, even to the center of his fountain, which is easily effected, being they are all of one essence. Do we not perceive this by an externall apprehension to be true, when we observe the northern pole of the Load-stone, in a kind of naturall duty, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and behold with a stedfast constancy the pole-star, which is so far off from the body of the Load-stone, though near and conjoyned in the beamy affection of one essentiall spirit? That this is so, we may perceive by the needle touched. Do we not gather by Astronomicall practise, that the distance of these two bodies, I mean, the celestiall star, and the terrestriall stone, is so great, as there cannot be esteemed a greater extension in our regard? namely, seeing that the space is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the starry heaven, or eighth sphear, in which the pole-star is; and the earth: And yet we find them to concur and meet in aspect, and to operate and sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with each other. What! and must this abstruse spirits action be limited by any phantasticall and imaginary sphear of activity, figured out by persons little skilled, and too too superficiall in the occult treasure, and arcane or centrall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God in nature? In like manner there must needs be a sympatheticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of occult beamy light, betwixt the Iron and the Load-stone, because they have both centrall stars, or beamy influences of one nature, and from one and the same fountaine, whose occult emanations pass, God knoweth, at how far a distance, although the effects do accidentally appear unto our sense, no more than the celestiall influences which descend from heaven, upon the Minerals, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, and Animals. Nevertheless, if we will believe the relations of History, we are told by <hi>Serapio, O aus Magnus,</hi> and the Moors, that as well in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as towards the northern pole, there are Rocks of this Stone, which suck and draw ships unto them at a far distance, and pull the iron nailes out of them, which is a cause, as they say, that they fasten together the plancks and boards of their boats and ships with wooden pins.

Verily, it is a great distance, that this magnetick Rock is able to operate upon the Iron, if that were true, namely, from the Aequinoctiall unto the frozen point of the North-pole; for unto the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall line, the Mariners make use of the Needle, to find out what altitude they are in. And although some do think this strange, yet for all that, many learned men, seen as well in Geography and composing of Sea-Maps, as delineating the description of the world, do firmly adhere unto this opinion. Whereby we see, that wise and learned men do confirm, that the limited sphear of activity, ascribed unto the Load-stone by the Peripatetick Philosophers, and Christian School-men of his sect is vain and frivolous.</p>

Then I was forced to send my dog back to look out, and after he had been absent half an houre, he brought the bouget in his mouth, which is strange, considering that I was on horse-back, and that he could not discern any footing of mine; and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> nevertheless he came to the bouget which I desired, and finding by it a sent of me he brought it again. But that I may come more pertinently to the business. A friend of mine being in my company lost his dog in the night-time, we came into a private house where he never was before; and being in a chamber, the doore being fastned, about half an hour after the dog came, and did violently scrape and bounce at the dore, to find out his beloved: whereby it is evident, that the beams of his affection, did in the absence of his Master not forsake his Master's beams, which guided him unto the unknown place so directly, that he found him out. Is it not also a wonderfull Sympatheticall Emanation, that the Pigeon called the Carrier, doth make unto the place or dove-coat wherein he was bred and fostered? Which for that reason, it doth so dearely affect and love, that though he be conveied 500 miles from his noursery in an enclosed basket, yet he will fly directly back again with a letter about his neck? Which is an evident Argument, that it is justly and straightly guided by the emitted beam of his affection, which is contiued, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a spirituall manner, with the place it doth most delight in. What shall we say in two persons; whereof the one doth love and affect without all reason, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prosecureth with the beam of his affection his beloved, though she or he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together either abhorring or neglecting, and not corresponding with the like beams
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57108:119"/>
of affection, doth not reciprocally embrace, but rather refuse and avert the beams of his or her Love. But where two do joyntly affect by a Sympatheticall Union, there the action will spiritually be furthered at a far greater distance; as when two starrs of heaven send out their beams semidiametrally, and concur in one harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious point of affections. Nay verily, as we behold, being taught by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that there will be a great Antipathy between the slain bodie's contracted spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the murtherer; insomuch that the lively spirit of the dead, being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted after death by cold, into its Center, doth through an angry Antipatheticall passion move again from the Center unto the Circumference, as it were to resist the deadly enemy; and doth cause the congealed blood to flow and move, as if it would meet with and assault afresh the murtherer's emitted spirit; So we must surely confess, that where one spirit concurreth in Sympathy with another of the like nature, the power must be the greater, and the action performed at a larger di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as is evidently expressed in the abstruse operation which is in the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick cure, effected between the weapon or ointment, and the wounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> person: of which I have spoken so much, in that hot encounter, which hath been between Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> and my self, in the Book where I was provoked to squeeze his Sponge; and farther do purpose in this present Treatise to enlarge my self a little better touching that point, by way of a comparison made between the Magneticall vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in Man, and that of the Load-stone.</p>
                        <p>The Argument of Mr. <hi>Foster,</hi> consisteth upon the impossibility of that operating virtue at so large a distance, as is propounded by some, to be effected by the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or rather of the lively blood's Emanation and emitting forth of his exciting spirituall beames or influences, unto the dead or congealed blood; which impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, if it were true indeed in the Animal kingdom, which is the most dilative and less bound with bodily bonds: I wonder that it should not be far more impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and unfezible in the mineral bodies, by reason of the firm and close solidity of them, which are therefore apter to retain their influentiall beams, then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which are made lax, and porous. Besides all this, the Animal body is hot and fiery, and consequently the readier to dilate, and send forth his virtue the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but the minerall is cold, and therefore the less active and powerfull in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his beams. And yet for all this, experience teacheth us, that the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone looketh towards the North-star, sendeth forth his spirituall aspect unto it: as also the star doth at the like distance send out his beams unto his Northern mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall mark, at an unmeasurable distance, as is said before; which being so, why should not (I beseech you) the Animall star derived from his celestiall Fountain, send out also his beams unto the frozen and chill blood, in his unctuous earth, I mean the Weapon-salve, or unto the blood's invisible spirit, sucked into the Iron by his attractive Sulphureous nature? For experience teacheth us, that though no corporall blood be found on the Iron, yet if the place of the weapon that wounded the person be anointed, it cureth by a like Sympatheticall aspect: For country-Chirurgions have made tryall, when they durst not search the wound with the Probe, and found by experience, namely, by putting the weapon into the fire, that the part of the sword or weapon will discover it self, which wounded the party, being that it will change colour from the rest; whereby they perceive how deep the wound is, by the observation of that part of the weapon which did penetrate. And therefore this is an evident argument of the ingression of the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy spirits into the wounding instrument, and consequently it argueth, that there are essentiall spirits, which emanate or issue forth of the blood, quite forsaking the body: whereby also it is expressed, against Mr. <hi>Foster,</hi> that if the grosser spirits of the blood are able to pierce the close-grained steel, its finer and more subtil spirits are able to penetrate without any resistance, all other things in manner of an influence. But wee'l approach a little nearer to our purpose, and will remove ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> argument from the minerall demonstration, unto the vegetable, that thereby we may express like by like, in our animal subject. I will therefore insist upon the Grain of Wheat, which being dead and putrified in the earth, is suscitated by the beamy influences of the Sun. For like doth draw his like by a magnetick power, and like rejoyceth in his like, and like is suscitated, and revived and quickened, or evoked from his rest or center, by his evoking, and alluring, or embracing like; and by this means, the beamy spark or atom of sunny influence in the grain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing idle, and doing nothing in the center thereof, is stirred up by his externall like, to act and operate his own delivery out of the elementall mire, or the slimy band
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57108:119"/>
of the elementary compound: And therefore, as it was before contracted from the externall cold into the center, it is now by the presence of fresh solary irradiation from above, exsuscitated, as is were, from death unto life; and so by the assistance of those celestiall beams, it passeth beyond the limits of the corrupted grain, and soareth above the earth, and seeketh by all means to ascend unto his native region, from whence it descended; but being cumbered in his ascent by the sublunary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the importunate elements, which enclose it on every side, it is beset with the volatil salt of the aire, and insteed of mounting into his desired place, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to multiply in his kind and to have companions, namely, other graines, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created like it self. In like manner the microcosmical Sun of life, raigning (as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do teach us) in the blood, doth emanate and send out his spirituall beams which are inseparable, by continuity joyned unto, and continued with, the spirit of the congealed blood, which is sucked into the iron, or other weapon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it; for, so pure, worthy, and subtle is the spirit of man's life, that every creature doth by a naturall instinct affect to participate with it;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>F sellus de De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
                           </note> yea, the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills are said to affect a dwelling place in mans body, by reason of the excellent temper thereof. Neither would I have any man to scorn this saying of mine; for there is a concupiscible passion even in the very stones and minerals themselves, as in the Load-stone and Iron it is made manifest; and the spirit of the Iron, though it be minerall, is of the same condition in his catholick nature, that all other spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are. And therefore marvell not, though I say, that the universall spirit affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the animal, being that for the same reason there hath been noted to be both a sympatheticall and antipatheticall condition between, as well the mineral and vegetable, and the mineral and animal, as between the animal and vegetable. But I will produce unto you a probable demonstration: There was an Earl (of whom, in my Book, intituled, <hi>The squeesing of Parson Foster's Spunge,</hi> I made mention) that had his Gardiner cruelly wounded in his hand with a syth, as he was mowing of grass the wound bled shrewdly, and could not be stenched: They went up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Lord, and signified so much unto him, and implored his assistance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to have some of his weapon-salve. He commanded, that forth-with the syth should be knocked off from his wooden handle, and conveyed unto him. The wounded fellow hearing so much, took a hammer himself, and holding it with one hand, he struck hard upon the weapon or syth with the other, and immediately (a wondrous thing to tell, and yet far from any suspition of diabolicall art!) the blood stenched, and he bled not one drop after it; as if the mineral spirit, which retained that of the animal, were terrified, and, as it were, in awe of the animal spirit that struck it, and thereby lost all the faculty of attraction; or that the spirits included in it, which did consent in harmony with the spirits of the bleeding man, had rejoyced in a kind of revenge which was taken on the weapon: For know, that there is a sympatheticall and antipatheticall irradiation, as well between the animal and the minerall, as between the animal and animal, or mineral and mineral. But mark, I pray you, a second notable observation, touching this point; Sir <hi>Bevis Thelwell</hi> told me, that for triall upon a Wheelers ax, that had wounded him grievously on his leg, after it was anointed and wrapped up, the wounded person that could not sleep for pain in five nights before, did sleep immediately after the oyntment, and was at rest; which when Sir <hi>Bevis Thelwell</hi> espied, he would needs make triall of a thing, which he had heard confirmed by many: He opened the anointed Ax, and scraped off the oyntment at one corner of it, and forthwith he was advertised, that the party complained of a grievous pain, which he felt just about that part of the wound where the ax was bare by scraping; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon also he anointed that protion over again, and suddainly the party felt ease. The same experiment was made and found true by the said Lord, Captain <hi>Stiles,</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas Gilbourn.</hi> I can also say upon mine own knowledge, that in the Church-yard on <hi>Bred-street</hi>-hill, a widow-Gentlewoman having a box of this oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cured many of the Tooth-ake, by pricking the pained tooth with a sharp stick, till it bled, and putting that stick into her box of oyntment. Among the rest, one of her neighbours, a contentious woman, having the tooth-ake, made means unto her for her cure, or to have ease. Her teeth were pricked, and the stick put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the oyntment, and she grew well. But within three or four daies after, she fell out with the Gentlewomans maid, and gave her Mistress but bad language; all which the maid did certifie her Mistress of. The Gentlewoman being merrily disposed, said, She would make her repent it, and went unto the box, and took away the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57108:120"/>
stick belonging to this woman out of the pot, and put it into a bason of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and immediately the woman had such pain, as she was forced to sue to the Gentlewoman, and she receiving another stick which had pricked her teeth anew, it gave her immediate ease. Which accidents, when I had well contemplated, I thought with my self, that the included spirit had his chiefest comfort from the oyntment, by keeping them warm; and that if the oyntment was removed, the cold aire, which is an enemy to the activity of the bloody spirits, was potent over it, and did congeal them; and so by consent of the beamy influence of life, emitted from the wound unto the included spirits, and continuated ever unto them, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable, (for it was one and the same spirit, according unto <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in two severall properties, that blowed from the north-wind, and the south) what distemper befalleth the included and congealed spirits in the weapon, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, by effect of remission of evoked beams, and, as it were, by a report, unto the wound of the patient. Again, we must consider, that the separated blood hath in it each respect of the Microcosm, no otherwise, than a portion of a whole Loadstone, being divided from the whole, hath in it all the proportions of the World, namely, the Poles, Aequinoctial, and so forth, as well as the whole in it; so that the Idea of the wounded member, is in the spirits of the emitted blood, and maketh his relation to every part thereof, no otherwise, than the poles of a piece of the Loadstone do unto the whole. As also there is the like occult attraction and emission of beams, between the little blood emitted, and the whole bulk of blood retained in the veines, as is between the small amputated Load-stone, and the whole. I conclude therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that as the congealed bloody spirits in the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, or amputated blood, do by vertue of the homogeniall heat, and unctuosity of the salve or oyntment, ripen and exspire out by little and little unto his fountain, no otherwise than the spark in the grain of corn, being kept and preserved in the earthly matrix from the cold crude aire, doth aspire upward to the heavenly Sun; so also by little and little doth the wound heal, and mend in the wounded crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And thus much for the manner of action, between the wound and weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salve. Now a word or two touching the intervall, or longitude of distance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the wound and the oyntment.</p>
                        <p>The distance betwixt the Pole star and the Load-stone is unknown, and yet the one doth operate in the other, by sending out their reciprocall beams upward and downward; therefore here can no certain limited sphear of activity be assigned unto their action. The Sun and the spirit in the grain of wheat do operate in like manner, by a continuation of one and the same nature. Lo here, is the limited sphear of activity also abolished, being no man can justly determine of the extensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the solar influence, of whose nature, the beam in the grain doth participate no otherwise, than one small Load-stone cut out of a great one, hath his parts, or poles and circles, in every respect corresponding with those of the great one. Man hath a most subtle influence, or vivifying spirit of life, sent down and infused into him by divine inspiration, in which is the property of the four winds, (as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> telleth us) and consequently the Idea of every nature; but the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of this spirit is indivisible, and therefore the vivifying spirit sent from it into man, hath all the properties of the spirit that infused it, no otherwise than a lesser Load-stone, cut out of the greater, hath in every respect the property of the greater. And consequently, the spirit of the one is no more divided from the other, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And why I pray? Why, because they cannot dive into the depth of her activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by whom they themselves do live, move, and have their being. Yea, and to limit her activity with bounds, according unto their pleasure, who (though they know not so much) have their life and volunty from her, which limiteth them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as she pleaseth, who is infinite in her being; for so much as she is a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not divided from that Divine Emanation which is infinite in his extention. It is evident therefore, that this vivifying Spirit can send forth its action unto any mark in the world, from any specifick nature, but especially from the Microcos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall creature; and the rather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the mark be of the same specifick condition, and the vehicle of the spirit, namely the effused blood, measuring first the distance between the wound and the Ointment. Moreover, we shall find this confirmed by other of her operations, effected in the same Microcosmicall Mine, from whence it emitteth its beams, at an unlimited distance. As for example: It is found by experience, and that by naturall means, without any suspition of Cacomagicall devices or superstitious artifices, that if a persons urine that hath the Yellow Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, be conveied at the distance of a hundred miles (as by an honourable Person of no small rank, and entire in Religion, I am informed, who hath often times made the tryall hereof) unto a place where a composition shall be made of the urine, and ashes of a certain tree, commonly known and had in this Kingdom, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine blades of Saffron, (as hath been told you in my Book, entitled <hi>The Squeezing of Parson Foster's Sponge</hi>) it often-times cureth that disease, when the best of Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call experiments have failed; and this Medicine misseth seldom, where the disease is curable. And now I will relate a true story, which befell this last yeare 1630, upon a Chirurgion's wife, who dwelled not far from the Tower of <hi>London</hi>: She fell desperately sick of the Yellow Jaundis, and had sick gripings, and shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The fellow was sent by me with a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter four miles into the country, and when he came unto the house, he found two that were there to give thanks for their recovery: For by that means they were cured. The urine was received for my sake, and the fellow sent away: But mark the consequence; so soon as the fellow was parted with the urine, the sick woman was tatled unto by demure Gossips, and told that it was done by witch-craft and the devill, and therefore dangerous for her soul, which made her rage and cry-out upon witch-craft, and was much discontented; which when I heard, I came no more unto her, esteeming her ungratefull, and sent suddenly to the Earl, to request him to undo the business, and break the clods; which he sent me word he would do, but told me it was to late: For (said he) it will work the effect howsoever. Indeed the woman mended immediatly after it, and no doubt did ascribe the cure unto some other inefficacious Physicall trash, applied per chance unto her by some Mountebank. All this I spake to my knowledg; and I am not ignorant of the manner of the cure: For it pleased the Noble Personage to impart unto me the manner; yea, and the Ladies his daughters have cured many of this disease; aswell rich as poore, who have made some means unto them for this cure. And this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Lord did assure me, that he had cured at an hundred mile's distance. I cannot chose but make you acquainted with another cure, which he effected upon a noble Lady that was my patient. She had extreamly the Jaundis, and though I did in some sort remove them for a while, yet it returned again. I then requested the Noble Knight her husband to send her water unto the foresaid Honourable Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and promised him to write my letter by him. All was done as I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled, and the Countess her self took it into her care to dispose of the water; and the rather, because the Lady that was sick, was of a Noble Parentage. Somewhat i wrought with the disease, but not to our purpose: Whereupon I did visite this Noble Man, and told him of the small success that his Medicine had. He willed
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57108:121"/>
me to send her water once more; and told me, that a Lady was with him in the foresaid noble patients behalf, the day before. I sent again her water, and from that time forward she mended apa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the reason of this cure is no otherwise effected, then that of the weapon-salve; for the spirit of the blood in the infected person, hath a continuated relation unto his salt, yea, and its habitation is in the aereall salt of the blood, which being a subtle earth, in the center whereof is the spirit contracted, and being partly dispersed in the urine, which is the whey of the blood, it sucketh and draweth unto it his like from the infected body, whereby it being, as it were, resuscitated, and newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, it emitteth new beams to meet, comfort, and correct the infected beams, emitted out of the sick body.

Whereby it is evident, that by one and the same medicine, the spirit in the urin's salt, and that in the sick-man's blood, are both sympathetically refreshed and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and the flame of the evill infecting spirit of the disease as well as in the urine as sick body, is antipathetically quenched and annihilated. In this respect therefore, we compare the composition of urine, ashes, and saffron in this cure, unto the weapon-salve, in the consolidating of wounds; and the urine carried from the sick unto the mass so compounded, unto the blood or spirit on and in the weapon; and the exsuscitating of the congealed spirit in the salt of the urine, unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivifying and exagitating of the spirit in the dead blood, or sucked up by the po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore then he proceedeth after this manner: He boreth a hole in another Oke as before, and keepeth those pieces which in the boring came out of the Oke, and bruiseth them, and quilts or stitcheth them up in a bag, and applyeth them to the member grieved; and this he doth just three daies before the new Moon: Then in the very hour of the new Moon, he taketh away the bag, and taketh out the bruised wood, and putteth it into the hole of the tree, and rammeth it in with a peg or pin of the same Oke. And if for all this the Gowt shall be perceived within three three months after, then he cutteth off the hair and nails of the feet, and tyeth them unto the back of a Crab-fish, and casteth it into the running water, and the gowty person will be cured. This Doctor of Physick doth professe in a certain Book of his, set forth by him in the German Tongue, that he hath cured many by the first experiment, and many other by the first and second, one after another; and lastly, many desperate ones by the first, second, and third. And he saith, that this manner of cure is commonly found cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in those Gowts, which happen of a sulphureous cause; but in those Gowts which rise from a Mercuriall and salt nature, it often faileth. And therefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this magnetick manner of cure, he betaketh himself unto a more externall kind of remedy.</p>

To conclude, it is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that seeing the spirituall Astralicall vertues, in each inferiour creature, do descend from celestiall stars, and are of one continued nature with them, as the Sun-beams which are here below, are not divided or separated from their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of light, it followeth, that they emit their beamy influences unto one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even as the two stars do in heaven, from whence they are animated: so that if the two stars in heaven be friends, they both do sympathize in the occurrences of their emanations with one another; but if they be enemies to one another in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they will, in their applications of beams, antipathize and decline from one another.

                        <p>WE read in many places in Scripture, that the devill maketh use of Gods creatures, to bring to pass his secret devices and stratagems against man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: as for example, Satan, to impoverish and ruinate the fortune of patient <hi>Job,</hi> did make use of the winds, and did call (as the Text saith) the fire of God from heaven to consume his cattle. God forbid, that we should esteem for this reason these creatures of God to be cacomagicall and diabolicall, because God made them act to accomplish the will of the devill: He made him also a Prince of the aire, insomuch as he hath power to stir up tempests in the seas, and storms in the elementary heavens; and therefore the aire by some is called, The Synagogue of Satan: What! must we therefore abhor the aire and winds, because the devill doth at sometimes act by and in them his mischievous feats? when as the aire is cleared and purified from all corruption (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith rightly) by agitation of the winds, for if it were not excited and moved by the winds, it would putrifie, as the standing waters doth. Again, if we should fly from, and loath the aire, how should we live? when the airy spirit is the spirituall seed of our life. We read also in Scriptures, that God causeth the Sun indifferently to rise upon the good and bad, and that the Sun and Moon do harm or hurt some, as again they are comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and propitious unto others;<note place="margin">Psal. 121.5.</note> and therefore <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>The Sun shall not harm thee by day, nor the moon by night.</hi> The Moon, which is termed by the Poets, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57108:122"/>
and that Satan also taketh his advantage on the diverse positions of her, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions and applications with other as well fixt as erratik starrs to work his feats: for he is an old beaten Souldier in Astrology, and knoweth the effects of every si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the heavens, and therefore can take the advantage of their strongest influences, upon animal, vegetable, or minerall creatures, which are subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, he knoweth the due times when they are poured down upon them, and is expert in their virtues, which are then onely of greatest efficacy and force, when the powerfull point of their proper constellation striketh upon them, and stirreth up their Centrall spirits, to shew forth the uttermost of their occult or arcane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and conditions, and then at the very instant, he collecteth the herb or stone, or maketh use of the Animal's members, or teacheth such as are Sorcerers to do it, without knowing the mystery of the constellation's concurrence or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication at that time of the collection with the naturall creatures so colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; So that when they attempt to make use of the same Simples at another time, they find them weak and of none effect; because the spirits of every herb, animal, or minerall, are weakest, when the starre which is their nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing celestiall mother, hath least power or dominion in heaven. All which the true Astrologicall Philosopher knoweth right well by experience, to be true: For gathering of a Simple at the point, when the constellation, as well fixt as erratick, which hath the essentiall dominion over it, is in his greatest dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and power in heaven, he findeth an admirable efficacy in it, as well in his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult as evident property; when contrariwise, if it be collected at a season, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the heavenly Patron is weak and feeble, they will appear as it were faint and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most dead in their power: Whereby it is most apparent, that it is the naturall creature's, which by their own essentiall natures work, even as well those sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall as antipatheticall effects, which the devill doth make use of to perform his devices, even as the Physitian, Philosopher or naturall Magitian doth, to effect their own ends.

Is it not God that worketh such effects in these his creatures? Did he not by his Word bestow such virtues on them in their Creation, and continued it in their sucession by generation? Why then is it not as possible unto Man, who is framed after God's Image, to know the true time of the collection of these creatures, with the uses and virtues thereof, as well as the devill? What? because, forsooth, he since the fall <hi>Adam,</hi> is blinded with ignorance, and cannot see or distinguish light from dakness? That <hi>Adam</hi> knew the virtues of the starrs and of every particular earthly creature subject unto every one of these starrs, we partly gather out of Scripture: For else could he not have assigned a proper name unto each of them, agreeing to his nature. But if the sucession of <hi>Adam</hi> is blind, and cannot distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of colours, and therfore is ignorant also in these hidden treasures of God; How, I pray you, came the devill to have so deep an insight in them, being that he fell for his rebellion, farre deeper than Man, and is clogged with a darker vayl than he, and therefore is called the Prince of darkness. Oh, you reply, the devill is a spirit without body, and therefore is able to discern the hidden things of God in nature, sooner and beter then Man, who is a gross bodily creature. And again, Man dieth every Age, but the devill by reason of his long continuance, is of great experience. I answer: That though Man die and continueth not long; and though he be obscured in his understanding by reason of his Fore-fathers fall; and though he be clad or indued with a dark and combersom body, yet hath he the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Truth, and a discovery of the abstruce mysteries of Naturall things first from God, bequeathed and left unto him by succession; that is, by a Cabalisticall tradition, even from our Fore-father <hi>Adam,</hi> and by the revelation of God's Wisdom,<note place="margin">Sap. 7.17.</note> or the good Spirit, which he hath bestowed upon the Elect: For by it (as <hi>Solomon</hi> himself doth restifie) he came to know the disposition of the Earth; the virtue of the Elements; the beginning, end and middle of times; the change of manners the division of times; the course of the year; the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57108:123"/>
in the mysteries of all Plants, even from the lowly Hysop, unto the lofty Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar of <hi>Libanon.</hi> Was it then a diabolicall action in <hi>Solomon,</hi> to look after, and to practise upon the abstruce natures of Plants and Animals, and to find out by his skill in <hi>Astrology</hi> the proper starrs, which are their true Patrons and charitable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in heaven, and to make election of their due times and seasons in gathering of them; being that the Divine Wisdom that made them, operates in them, and by them, taught him this skill; because the devill also is by his acute observation made partaker of their knowledg, and doth make use also of all these things to serve his own turn: What? because, I say he, hath this knowledg to elect every Simple, in his force and season, by observation of that reference which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the starrs and them; Therefore must not Man be partaker of their natural virtues, or be made cunning in the skill of collecting them, but by the aide and revelation of the devill? When in flat terms the Scriptures say, that God made them all for the use of Man, must they be esteemed diabolicall in all that use them, and therefore be forbidden, because the devill doth sometimes serve his turn with them? As who should say, that God should create any thing, onely for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's use, and not to serve man in each necessity, and that according unto his free will, being that it is said, that He gave man power, and made him Lord over all his creatures.

But besides all this, as there is nothing in the world, that worketh more effectually by Sympathy and according unto nature, than one wholsome and sound nature doth with another; So verily is there nothing, that operateth more Antipathetically, and contrary to nature or destructively, than the corruption of an empoysoned or infected spirit, doth with a wholsome spirit of his like Species. And the reason is because it coveteth and desireth by an earnest communication of his beams, to receive (as it were help and succor in its distress from the sound spirits, unto the irradiations whereof, it applieth it self for relief: as we see in the time of contagion, the spirit arising or emanating from the infected person, applieth his infected beams greedily unto the emanating spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his wholsome like; and so by a continuation of one unto the other, the fiery venome of the one impoysoneth and co-inquinateth the salutary nature of the other, and that onely with his specifick like: For commonly the Plague, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar unto Men, doth not stick or cleave unto the spirit of beasts, namely unto that of Sheep, and such other. As in like manner, the Murren in beasts, infecteth not Man's spirit; but the like specifick nature is evermore aprest, to embrace and apply his beams unto his like: For this cause therefore it is evident, that as our of a wholsome Man, there may be had a spirituall Mummy, which is wondrous healthfull and salutiferous unto mankind; in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57108:123"/>
were forced into his mouth; and so hung up and exposed unto the hot Sun, with a silver bason under his mouth, to receive that which dropped from his mouth; of which (as he related unto me) the <hi>Jew</hi> made a kind of poyson so deadly, that it did surely kill where it touched; affirming that he sold it at an excessive rate. The like was effected, (as I was told by the Pope's Apothecary, dwelling in <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>; and since, it hath been confirmed by others, that came from <hi>Rome</hi>) by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cardinal, who immediatly after he had got his red-headed Mistris with child, and nourishing her with all the delightfull dainties that might be, till she was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, did in a secret Court in his Pallace bury her, armes and all, unto the paps, and so let loose unto her two hungry Asps, or, as a <hi>German</hi> heard it related, two deformed Todes, the which making immediately unto her dugs, sucked, and in sucking bit her, and impoysoned her dugs; and when the Todes were full, that milk became (as he said) so venomous and deadly, that it infected any one that touched it, it was so subtle and piercing. And besides, (as the former story goeth) the woman was taken up, and after her back was broken, was hanged her legs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward against the Sun, to receive that venomous liquor which distilled from it into a silver vessell, wherewith he intended to have poysoned that Cardinall, which stood as a block in his way between the Popedom and him. But all was discovered, and he, according to his merit, did endure the fiery triall for it. And the reason why the red headed man or woman is elected most fit for this purpose, is, because they are subject by their nativity unto the influences of the Sun, and therefore are the more capable of, and obnoxious to corruption; wherefore their spirituall Mummy being contaminated by the animal poyson, is after his fermentation and putrefaction, made admirably subtle, and exceeding malitious. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the sympatheticall desire be in the specifick Mummy, to be joyned with his like, yet by reason it is infected, and intoxicated by that antipatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call spirit of the invenomed beast, which hath got the mastery over it, it cannot embrace his like sympathetically, but it infecteth it also by his antipatheticall additament, and so the accidentall venome converteth them both into his nature.

Moreover, it is a common thing, amongst them and the Necromancers, to frequent the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and to visit the graves of such as are dead, either for some part of them, or else for a piece of their winding-sheet, or of the coffin wherein they were buried, by reason of the spirituall Mummy which sticketh unto them, to effect their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and naughty devices. It hath been confessed by a witch, that destroyed a Noblemans children of this Land, that she could have no power over one of them, till she had recovered an old glove that it wore, and afterward she had power over it: the reason was, because of the relation which the spirituall Mummy of the child, that entered by sweat into the glove, had with that of the body; no otherwise than that spirit upon the weapon hath, unto the spirit of the wounded body; so that as that fareth, either in hot or cold distempers, so also it fared with the spirit in the wound, as it appeared, when the ax or weapon was uncovered by chance, the wound would be dolorous and distempered with cold; and when of purpose part of the oyntment was pared off from the weapon, that part of the wound which corresponded unto it, would ake and be troubled; so also the witches, applying their naughty venom unto the Mummy in the glove, shooe, or other part of the worn-shirt, smock, sock, or such like, do produce their venomous effect afar off.

The influence and light of the heavenly Sun, in the which is the spiracle of life, being ill received, doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time breed unnaturall effects, yea, the devill himself maketh use of it, to serve his use at severall seasons; and yet neither it, nor his vertues, can for all that be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med diabolicall. In like manner, if we descend from the animal sphear, unto the vegetable and mineral, we find, that the notorious Enchantress <hi>Medaea,</hi> made speciall use in her enchantments, (as also the same is related of other sorcerers and witches) of herbs, stones, and mineralls, without the help of which naturall things, neither they, nor their devill, which revealed unto them their secret ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, could effect or accomplish their desires. And for this purpose, (as <hi>Ovid</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the story) she searched the lofty tops of <hi>Ata,</hi> to find out herbs for her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. Many operate their feats by the vertuous property of stones, which the devill doth deliver unto them, though they themselves know neither the starry influence that giveth the force, nor yet how they should be prepared for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of such strange effects: As for example, There was a witch in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who

at her arreignment did confess, that by the property of a stone which was taken from her, she could discover any thing, namely if a thing were true it would sweat, and if it were false, it would not sweat; and also it would reveal other things unto her by changing colours. And again, when they desired to see some conclusions from her, she said, that if they would let her have her stone, she would shew them some: But they fearing that she would escape by that means durst not let her have it, but did burn her at the Queens Ferry in <hi>Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then they find these plates to be of a strange effect, in many Magical executions. What? And because the devill knoweth the virtue and properties of these naturall things, and can instruct his minsters in the evill usage of them; therefore doth it follow, that <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the wise Magitians of the East, and many other good and godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, do not know their virtues, their times of collection, and their manner of application in goodness; yea, and if they see a just cause in a contrary sense, and that without the transgression of the bounds of naturall and lawfull Magick, whose true subject is the Spirit of Wisdom, which is the Basis or foundation of true Naturall Philosophy? What make we of the means which <hi>Moses</hi> used, when he by dispersing of ashes, brought the botch over all <hi>Aegypt</hi>? But some will say, that this was supernaturally done: Let them but look into the occult Secrets in the nature of other animals, vegetables, and mineralls, and they shall find as great mysteries as these contained naturally in them, all suspition of commerce with the devill being set apart. Was the reverend Father <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> a Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magician, because he reciteth the abstruce, occult, and mysticall virtues of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, Plants, and Stones.

Or must these be the pupills of the devill, because they know the times and houres of their collection, and manner of preparation, though they kept that secret unto themselves? No verily, for they had it from tradition, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the mysticall and profound Philophers or naturall Wisemen, such as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Hermes,</hi> and the wise men called <hi>Magi,</hi> or naturall Magicians of the East, which revealed them unto the worthy, by succession from one Age unto another. Was it not a wondrous propery in <hi>Gyges</hi> his ring, that cold make him, by the naturall property that it had, to walk invisible?

And secondly, That it is the same Spirit that made those virtues in every specifick thing, namely in the starrs above; and in the animal, vegetable, and minerall kingdoms beneath. Which being so, what can the devill, being but a reasonable creature as well as man, do, in the creating of these essentiall virtues by which he worketh his feats, more then man? Or why should we attribute that unto him, which doth rightly belong unto the all-creating and acting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the internall creature? If man please, he may attribute the wickednesse of the action unto the devill, which instigateth man to evill, and teacheth him the means to effect his bad intent; that, verily, doth of right belong unto the devill: For he was created for a destroyer, as the Prophet <hi>Isaias</hi> testifieth to us; and to effect it he maketh use of God's naturall creatures; for he used the fire of God from heaven, to destroy <hi>Job</hi>'s cattle, and the corrupt aire to kill with the Plague or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence the <hi>Israelites</hi> for <hi>David</hi>'s sins: Neither was it ever observed, that he could do ought against man of himself, saving onely in temptation: but he opera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for example: <hi>Claudaea, Fellea, Joan, Banno</hi> and <hi>Nicola Piscatrix,</hi> with all their Society, in <hi>Lorraine,</hi> confessed the 9. of <hi>May</hi> 1581. that they had delivered unto them by the devill, subtill powders of three natures, the which were distinguished in colour: For (said they) that of a black colour killeth, being strewed on meat, or rubbed on the body, or sprinkled on the apparell; and that of an ashen or reddish colour, causeth diseases: but the white Powder did cure those diseases. And <hi>Odella Boncuriana</hi> being arraigned the 18. of <hi>January</hi> 1586. saith that it was the manner of the witches of his faction, to strew a poysoned powder in the way where they should pass, on whom they would work mischief. And <hi>Francis Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> confessed the 4. of <hi>November</hi> 1588. that an herb was given her by the devill, to be laid in the way that <hi>Riberianus</hi> (who did beat her for stealing some of his peares) did pass, which caused him suddenly to fall sick. <hi>Francis Follers,</hi> and <hi>Marget Warny,</hi> and <hi>Jacobit Equine,</hi> confessed the 15. of <hi>January</hi> 1584. that they had Ointments, by which they anointed rods and whips; So that if they touched therewith, but the vestments of any one, he died not long after. Also they said, that if they anointed their hand with this Magicall Ointment, if they but touched any one's garments, they died within a small space after. Thus you see how the devill cannot work but by naturall poysons: For nothing proceedeth meerly of himself, but prestigious apparitions, namely those which seem, but indeed are no more in effect, then a painted image is in regard of the true substance.</p>
                        <p>And therefore let not the devil's ministers make their braggs, that this commeth from his invention: For the true Alchymists speak upon their own experience, that their Matter when it is in rotting and black, is more destructive then the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous Tyrean or Serpent, and therefore it killeth suddenly; wherefore they warn the operatours to beware of their Fumes: but when it appeareth in decoction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween white and black, it reduceth the Patient into a straight between death and health; that is, into a sickly constitution; and the white, which signifieth perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of maturity, causeth health, and cureth infirmities, and preventeth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, that the black and ash colour bring with them; So that you see the devill can do no more of him self then man is able. Again, for strewing of the destroying powder, the same was effected by man's wicked invention in <hi>Millane,</hi> the yeare 1629. And for the Ointment which killeth by an immediate contact, the <hi>Jew</hi> and the Cardinall knew that wicked craft, namely to abuse God's creatures as well as the devill: for whosoever it touched, it killed; and again, the Hermit effected the same business by anointing the hammers of the doores, and had his <hi>Alexipharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> or counter-poyson for it, as well as the devill; So that you may see that the wicked-minded man, that abuseth God's good creatures, as well as the devill, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering it from the true sense, for which it was created by God, for the benefit of Man; may rightly be rancked with the devill, and be termed justly, a devill incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, in that without the devil's furtherance; he can effect many devilish waies, to destroy, as well as the devill, without flesh and bones. I conclude therefore, that it is a great absurdity; yea, and a gross foppery or madness in ignorant men, so lightly to adjudge and censure the abstruce <hi>Magnalia,</hi> or occult Mysteries of God in Nature, as to affirm them to be actions or inventions of the devill, though their effects were bad, much less when they are good, and salutiferous; as is that of the Weapon-salve, when it is commonly known unto God, and all truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding men, that it is the animal, vegetable, or minerall creature, which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth the one by abuse, and the other in the true property and virtue; that is, for the use, for which it was created by God: For God created all creatures good, and consequently for a good use; but it is the malice of the devill, that diverteth it from his true use; which also is evidently confirmed by the Wiseman in these words, <hi>Creavit Deus ut essent omnia, &amp; sanabiles fecit nationes orbis terrarum, &amp; non est in illis medicamentum exterminii,</hi>

                        <p>We see therefore, that all occult operations proceed from the hidden vertue in naturall things, which were discovered by Gods Spirit, as well unto mankind, as conceived by the sharp-witted observation of Satan. Unto good men, I say, they were detected by the good Spirit, to do good, and prevent evill; for except the evill be known, a counter-poyson will hardly be found out: Unto bad men, they were administred to execute mischief and iniquity. I will reckon up some of these secret vertues, in each of the three kingdoms of compound creatures, namely, Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral.</p>
                        <p>First therefore for the Animal. The Owl is said by <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> to have many notable vertues; For, saith he, if his heart and right foot be put upon one that sleepeth, he will forthwith tell what he hath done, or any thing that you shall ask him; and he saith, that it hath been tryed by some of his brethren to be most true. And again, if one do but put it under the arm-pit, no dog will bark at him. Also the Goat's blood is reported by him, to turn glass into a soft and malleable temper, if the glass be sod in it and vinegar, that one may handle it like paste, so that if it be cast against the wall, it will not break. And if one maketh an oyntment of the same composition, and do annoint his face with it, things will appear hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and terrible unto him. And if the said composition be put in the fire, and there be present one that hath the falling-sickness, and a Loadstone touch him, he will presently fall into a fit as dead, and if some cold water be given him to drink, he will recover. So (saith he) if a candle be annointed with the Camel's blood, all men in the room will seem to have Camel's heads. And thus he proceedeth in his History, with a description of admirable wonders, which are effected by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult properties of beasts, vegetables, and stones. If Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> and his adherents shall say, that all these are lies, I reply, That it was a learned Philosopher, and famous Theologian that relateth them, who, no doubt, would, if he lived, tell him, That he should learn to understand the hours of elections, the stars that have dominions on the earth, and their times of exaltation or fortitude on the earth. And lastly, over what creatures in the three compound Kingdoms they have their proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences. For my part, I know admirable secrets in man and beasts, for the which the Peripatetick Philosophy can yield no reason; as for example, That the Pike or Jack-fishe's guts dried, should mightily provoke urin; the sucking of blood from a Mole, whose nose is cut off for the same purpose, will cure the falling-sickness, and that after the taking of it, it maketh the party exceeding sick; as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath taught us, by the cure of a Lady in <hi>Kent,</hi> who was cured thereby: Also, that it being burnt unto powder, it should, by an occult nature, expell the cholick. That the heart and liver of the Frogs should be approved, for the falling-sickness. That a Snake's skin should accelerate and hasten a woman's delivery. That the menstrues in a woman should cause a Leprosie. That the Toad dried should stench blood, as also the Spider, being applyed unto the nostrills of him that bleedeth, as I have often tried.</p>
                        <p>As for other occult miracles in stones, mettles, herbs, and animals, the true schollars unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> I mean, <hi>Hermes, Plato, Albertus Magnus, Diascorides,</hi> and such like, are full; and doubtlesse they would not prove so sottish and indiscreet, to publish lies, and to write things of impossibility, averring them to be effected in their knowledge, and so by that means, lose that reputation, which they have

For being it is the catholick love which imparteth it self unto every particular existence, to give it action and motion, to attract his like nature, for a convenient nourishment, assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and consolation; so also it maketh the organ in which it acteth, to resist and expell all such emanations, as either in order, quality, or essence, do disagree, and are opposite or harmfull to the specifick existence or conservation. For this reason therefore it endueth the creature with a double affection, namely, with a concupiscible desire, and an irascible hatred, whereof the one doth rejoyce or sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with his like, and therefore allureth or draweth it unto him, to consolate and assist him in his beeing; the other doth eschew and drive away, by an antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall and odious aspect, that which may be harmfull and noysome unto it. And this is the act of that all-creating and sustaining Wisdome, which made each crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by a kind of successive preservation, which it sucketh from his like in the world, to be and exist; and consequently hath given it an irascible faculty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it self, from that which is contrary unto it: Whereby we may see, how this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vifying spirit doth moderate all things with an unpartiall hand, insomuch that though it hath framed all things by opposition, namely, light and darknesse, and therefore in mans regard both good and evill; yet he ordained, that each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall should have the faculty, to eschew with an irascible and antipatheticall
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57108:126"/>
disdain, that which unto it is contrary either in order or nature, or both: untill the time be accomplished, in which after he is exalted, he shall expell all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and discord out of this world, by making a sympatheticall union amongst all things, which also St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth argue in these words: <hi>Cum evacuaverit om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Principatum,</hi>

For this reason every like particle in the animal or vegetable kingdom, that worketh after the same manner, are justly tearmed Magneticall. Hereupon the well experimented Doctor, <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> when he writeth of the mysticall Mummies, as well corporal as spirituall, and of the attractive means or manner to extract them, as well out of the living as dead bodie; He, for the better instruction of his Schollers, and such as he termeth <hi>filios Artis, the children of Art,</hi> expresseth examples, drawn from the Load-stone and the Iron: For by it he doth sufficiently declare the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of extracting the said Mummy, and consequently doth open after his fashion, what the Microcosmicall, or Animal Magnet is, by means whereof it is extracted out of the body, namely that it is a corporall or substantiall thing, as he seemeth to justify in these words: <hi>Spiritualis Mummia non operatur nisi per corporalia me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia: The spirituall Mummy worketh not but by corporall means.</hi> Where he intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by corporall means, those secret Magneticall bodies, which suck it forth of the living animal, and make it to operate, as well at home by an immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract as abroad, namely in or at an unlimitted distance; that is to say, by a naturall and convenient transplantation. He therefore who is wise and profound in these mysteries of Nature, and unto whom the Sympatheticall Concordance, abstruce properties, nature, virtues, and originall of the Load-stone, and the Iron, is well known, will know that their example may fitly be applied unto man: For by it he may easily discern the Microcosmicall Magnets, and understand the manner of their extraction of the spirituall Mummy out of man, and withall conceive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end and usage thereof. That thetefore these things may be the better dilated and enucleated unto the well-wishing Reader, I think it fit in the first place, to touch a little the same string of one symphoniacall Concordance, that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the nature and Originall of the Load-stone, and the Iron, which we have more fully mentioned in the precedent Book of this our discourse, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may with the greater facility, gather what the Microcosmicall Magnets are.</p>
                        <p>As I told you before, in the third Chapter of the second Book of this Treatise, that it was evident, that the Load-stone, otherwise called the Calamite, or mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Magnes, proceedeth, not of any naturall beginning, but rather of a monstrous birth and originall, forasmu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And again, the Iron finding the like spirits in the Load-stone, doth covet as fast to be possessor of them, by an equall coition or desire, and so a conjunction or union is made no otherwise between them, than between man and wife. But because the Loadstone is fuller of the Saturnine stony Mercury than the Iron, which is purified from it by fire, and consequently more near unto the property of the male, therefore it sucketh not the Load-stone so greedily unto it, as the Load-stone doth the Iron. For it is an old confirmed axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om, That Matter doth desire and long after Form, and as eagerly doth draw and allure it, as the female doth the male. But that the Iron is in lieu of the male, it appeareth, in the strength that it addeth unto the Load-stone, for if the Load-stones pole be capped with steel, it doth so far animate it beyond his own proper nature, that it causeth it to draw unto it a far greater proportion of Iron, then otherwise it was able. This therefore being rightly considered, we may with the greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility collect, what that micro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> did teaeh us, <hi>Quod sit sapientis celare rem, It is the part of a wise man to hide the thing.</hi> And the wise Philosophers in their Writings, did so considerately express the secret of nature, that they might hide it from the ignorant and uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vulgar, and yet speak plainly to such as are the children of art, and sons of true learning. But this is not all, for I would have you to understand, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the magnetick microcosmicall work is so universall, that it sheweth the way, as well to infect the Mummiall spirits of man with a venomous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious antipatheticall nature, as to extract it in its wholsome and sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patheticall condition, whereby it may be employed in good and salutary usages. And for that reason, namely, because evill-minded persons, as well witches and sorcerers, whom the devill hath instructed in the abuse of this excellent mystery, as also wicked minded-men, I mean incarnate devills, may do great mischief in the world, by the publick revelation thereof; for most men are proner unto mischief, than inclined to do goodness; I think it to be the wisest part, not to name the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall microcosmicall Magnet openly, but onely to express it in more generall
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57108:128"/>
tearms. I would have therefore each wise man to understand, that the magnetick nature, as well antipatheticall as sympatheticall, of all things, consisteth onely in the sulphureous vertue of the vitall spirits, which by reason of their incarceration, are apt to attract their like unto them, by contracting of it self from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto the center: Even so the animal, vegetable, and mineral salt, which is the immediate receptacle of this sulphureous spirit, that by reason of its pure, Saturnine, Mercurial earth, sucketh and draweth by the act of the included spirits their like from the circumference, whereby they vegetate and multiply, both in their airy volatill salt, which by a Saturnine or northern condition, is like snow or frost condensed, and in their aetheriall or celestiall fire. And again, the sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous spirit flyeth back, or reflecteth his beams into its centrall salt, after it did emanate unto the circumference of the body by northern accidents, namely, by externall cold, as it appeareth by the fiery or heavenly seeds included in the aire, that is retained within the Weather-glass, which when the north-wind bloweth is contracted, by reason that the expansed spirits of the celestiall sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phure, or the heavenly fire which is in it, flying from his cold opposite, betaketh it self unto the center of the aire, compassing, as it were it self with a clowd, or making it a house, to resist the northern blasts inclemency. For (as hereafter I will shew you in my magnetick demonstration) that the sulphureous Aequator is an enemy to the cold Mercurial poles. Also in mans body, when a northern or stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid fear possesseth it, the sulphureous spirits contract themselves, and leave the externall aspect pale, blewish, and wan, and in so doing, contract the internall spirits of the body unto the center; but this motion is antipatheticall, and caused by unnaturall passion. Again, those sulphureous included spirits being at liberty, they dilate and expanse themselves into the open aire, as having no evident magnet to attract or contract them into a narrower room. To conclude therefore, the microcosmicall Magnet must issue and be ingendred from the microcosmicall sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous spirits in his proper salt, which is his form, &amp; from a more strange Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which by his vicinity and propinquity, is most familiar with it, and, as it were, akin unto it by adoption, and this is his passive matter. Wherefore of these two microcosmicall portions, I mean, the formall and materiall, our secret Magnes is framed, by the which, the spirituall Mummy is extracted out of the living man, by means whereof, admirable cures, and pernicious harms may be effected, as well <hi>ad distans,</hi> or afar off, as near at hand, or by an immediate contact or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration. Moreover, the same internall Magnet, or attractive salt in man, in whose interior the sulphureous vivifying spirit doth dwell, and of whose condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and root, our foresaid microcosmicall Magnet is, will perform the self same salutary effects, and many other rare experimentall conclusions, if it be conveyed into the blood by transplantation from the alive person by an effluxion; or in the nails and hair, separated from him to another subject. There is also another mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosmicall Magnet, which is taken from the dead man, by the means whereof, the spirituall Mummy may be drawn out of the living man, and applyed for mans health, as well by an immediate administration, as by transplanting of it into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable plant, herb, or tree, as in the progress of this Book shall be more amply declared. But because the order of these things in our demonstration, <hi>à posteriori,</hi> or by progression from the effect unto the originall cause of these things, will be most convenient for the common and vulgar capacity, I will begin to ascend in this mine explication from grosser elements, unto more subtle, intricate, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struce things, as if by proportionate degrees I should mount from the earth into heaven. I purpose therefore first to express and demonstrate unto you, those things magnetically, which are onely wrought by the corporall contact of two severall bodies of the same naturall condition. But before I will begin with the Mummy, which is taken out of mans dead body, I think it in the first place most necessary, to entreat of the dead carcase his mystery, that we may proceed the more metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically in our intent.</p>

                           <p>That there are four sorts of corporall Mummy, whereof one onely is usefull and necessary for salutary purposes. In this Chapter also is set down an experiment, with certain ocular Demonstrations, confirming the magneticall or a tractive vertue of the Basamick spirits, which are in the usefull Mummy.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>SUch as have profoundly considered, and deeply respected, as well the externall as internall nature of man, have perceived, that the microcosmicall Mummy is of two conditions, namely, corporall or spirituall; of the first, I purpose to speak in this present Chapter; the second shall be handled hereafter, and that at large. Touching the corporall Mummy, it is either naturally sympatheticall, or unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally antipatheticall. We find therefore by experience, that the naturall Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is onely medicinable and salutiferous, after his due preparation, which is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected chiefly by his own magnetick property; the rest are apter to breed diseases, and to infect such persons as are in health, than to afford them any salutary relief or consolation; for, as according unto the nature of the four elements, there are four kinds of corporall and substantiall Mummyes, so also are they distinguished according unto those elements, whose natures they have endued; of the which, three of these are corruptible, and inducers of death and sickness, namely, the earthly, the watery, and the fiery; and onely that which is airy, is util to mans life, and amicable unto his nature. Concerning those three kinds of Mummy which breed corruption, the reason why they prove corruptible, is this: We must hold it first for a generall axiom in Philosophy, <hi>Quod corruptum corrumpentis naturam in se induit, That the thing corrupted, doth endue the nature of the thing corrupting</hi>: As for example, If the dead carcase of a man be corrupted in the earth, it is changed and passeth into the nature of the earth, and becommeth inutil for mans health, and indeed rather destructive then constructive or wholsome. Again, if the corruption be made in the water, then the corrupted flesh or dead body will acquire or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due a waterish and masseluginous disposition, which also will prove very incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious or unprofitable, for the conservation of the vitall spirits. And lastly, by the inordinate violence of fire, the spirits in the Mummiall body will be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, wasted, or expired. Now the reason why these said corporall Mummie's in those estates, are inconvenient for the conservation of health, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Because the foresaid three do so destroy and corrupt the body of them, that they make and constrain his earth, his water, and his fire, to return unto their first matter; so that whereas the earth and the water are ordained, to be the recepta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>les of two vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vifying elements, namely, of fire and aire, which onely can be conserved in a body that is incorrupted, it must of necessity follow, that in the three foresaid Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, those vivifying spirits must needs vanish and fly away, for want of a naturall body, which is now become corrupted and destroyed, and therefore unnaturall. Seeing therefore nothing is required in the true Mummy, more then that which is apt and proper for the conservation of life, yea, for life it self, which is the aire, which is banished and expelled from the three forsaid Mummies, therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be extracted out of them, but sickness, death and destruction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently antipatheticall effects; so that if a sound, murthered, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> strangled body, do rot under the earth, or in the water, it is not fit or proper for the wholsome use of mans body. The very self-same regard is to be had unto such bodies, as die through infirmityes and diseases, and although they are not visibly corrupted by the three foresaid externall elements, yet nevertheless it happeneth so, that a certain invisible corruptible influence and impression, is made or caused from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall elements, into the internall. From hence therefore proceedeth that intestine war in mans body, whereby the elements do kill and corrupt one another, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a divers fashion, namely, otherwise in one body than in another, according as one element or elementall alteration, is said to have dominion or rule over the other. And this is the reason, that such variety of diseases do haunt mans body: as for example, The Dropsie commeth of the strong impression of water, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick or burning Feavor of fiery insultations, and the Leprosie of the dominion of earth, &amp;c. And therefore also, where any such elementary corruption happeneth unto the body, there the wholsome spirit of the corporall Mummy, with his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitacle or dwelling mansion, is utterly overthrown, and the spirit is forced to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57108:129"/>
depart, and consequently contrary Mummiall spirits, do dominere, and are ready to operate antipathetically as shall be expressed in the second member of this Book.</p>
                        <p>But if the sound body, that is, not haveing any infirmity be killed onely by and in the Element of aire; that is to say, through strangling or by hanging, then there will be found no impression of the foresaid Elements in the corporall Mass of mans carcass. And for that reason it will remain incorrupted, and will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any Elementall resolution, so long as it is conserved in the aire. If therefore the body or tabernacle of the spirits, and vital Balsom remaineth entire, then that aereall vitall Balsom is not compelled to depart from his lodging, so long as the body is not resolved by nature or art, But if it be resolved, then it will forsake the body, as the soul doth; as also the animal astral spirit, which did reconcile the one with the other. But the vitall, vegetable and Balsamick spirit, remaineth in the incorrupted body: It followeth therefore, that this airy kind of Microcos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall Mummy, is most proper for the conservation of vitall spirits in the living man, being extracted, prepared, and rightly after preparation to be applied, I will therefore come briefly unto our Magneticall Experiences, touching this Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miall Subject.</p>

                           <head>The Proposition.</head>
                           <p>If this salutary kind of airy Mummy, with his vehicle or Magneticall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be taken, or chosen, or selected rightly, it will indue by reason of the absence of actuall life, and the dominion of cold, the condition of the Northern pole, and consequently by that reason, those airy included spirits, which were whilst the body was living, of an hot aequinoctiall nature, and therefore more dilative from the Center of the Circumference than attractive, are now by death made to act from the Circumference to the Center, if they be excited by their like spirits, which are aequinoctiall and lively, and then they become attractive of the aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall Mummy, namely by contracting themselves into the Center, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this airy microcosmicall Mummy, must be indued with the Magneticall property of the Northern pole, and therefore by a contactuall application of it to his like the living man, it will suck and attract greedily his like nature; and having drawn it in, will retain it; So that it may, by a due preparation, be made sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patheticall, and reduced into a singular medicine for mans health and conservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Or it may be so contaminated, and made antipatheticall with the impure and infectious Mummy, of the infirm living creature, that it may free the infirm, by extracting out the poyson which did infect it, and infect a wholsome and sound bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, unto the which it shall be given inwardly.</p>

                           <p>I collected a portion of this Northern Mummy, namely of the flesh of a man strangled in the aire, in which the spritual Mummy, was Centrally contracted by cold, and I applied it typically unto the part of my body, which was nearest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it in naturall position. I found it in the contact passing cold, and as it were ice and Northern. After it had remained on, a certain time, I found, that in the exciting of his frozen and Northernly contracted spirits, by the aequinoctiall heat of my body, they drew off my Mummiall and vivifying spirits greedily, and at some times, and as it were by fits, I felt them in their Magnetick operation sensibly, and after a kind of dolorous fashion, to tug and pull some adjacent parts close about it; in conclusion, after a certain time I took it off, and found it much altered in smell and view, by reason of the quantity of my spirits, which they attracted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; both which Mummiall spirits, so Magnetically congregated together, I extracted, and prepared after my manner, for the use of mine own body. But because my assertion will perchance be of little credit, I will prove the feisibility of it, and probability of every particle or member hereof, by many and sundry examples or Demonstrations.</p>

                           <p>To prove and demonstrate, that the airy spirit of the Microcosme, is apt to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57108:129"/>
take any polar impression, as well as the aire of the Macrocosm, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is more Magneticall, or attractive in his Northern or cold property, than in his aequinoctiall or Southern habit. Look considerately upon the aire included in the Wether-glass, which served as a catholick demonstration unto my precedent Philosophy, and you shall see, that when the aequinoctiall, namely the Eastern and Southern winds do blow in the aire, the particular included aire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the universall Element of air excluded, is less Magnetick or attractive, than when the Northern winds do blow. The proof is made evident, because that when those winds do blow, the externall aire, and therefore the internall, is more apt to be dilated, by reason of the Emanation of the Sulphureous or celestiall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which are included in each airy spirit, from the Center unto the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, making thereby a certain expulsion, or rather expansion of airy parts, by ratifying of the body of it. And therefore it is observed in the Instrument, not to draw the water higher then the figure 1. but to repell it down lower: Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise when the North winds blow, the dilated and mobil aire is by attraction or condensation, contracted into immobil snow; that is to say, into an earthly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, So that we see that the aire in this estate is admirably contractive, as it is expressed to the life, in the demonstrative Instrument or Wether-glass: For the included spirit attracteth the ponderous water upward, and contracteth it self out of a large room or place, into a narrow Angle or space, as it appeareth when the Northern Snow and Frosts, have had long dominion in the Macrocosmicall world, by a Northern breath, at which time we shall find the water against his nature, to be sucked up unto the upper figure 7. The reason whereof I have shewed you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, namely because the occult Sulphurous nature or spirit, which is the Sun of light, and the actor in life, being carried in his airy vehicle, flieth from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting cold, which is his adversary, and armeth it self about in the Center, with a condensed aire, to hinder or break the universall assault of cold, which is the impe of darknesse, and therefore hath his seat at the pole, which is furthest off from the presence of the Sun. In like manner, the dead and cold Mummial spirits being for this reason Centrally contracted, and as it were mortified and congealed by appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it to the lively Spirits, as the cold Northern aire, or spirit unto the aequinoctiall or Southern Sun then reviving, and incited by the living man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tactuall or contiguous presence, do greedily draw them in, as imploring their aid against their cold adversary, and having the possession of them seemeth better satisfied. I will prove this to be so by this demonstrative Example, taken from the Load-stone.</p>

Also, a worthy Gentlewoman of mine acquaintance, had (as she telleth me) raw beef applyed unto her neck, for to divert the rheum from her eyes; but she confessed, that it drew so strongly unto it, that she felt her eyes, as it were, sucked or drawn into her head, and will not be perswaded to this day, but that her eyes are deeper in her head than they were. Whereby it is argued, that by far greater reason, the experiment above mentioned is in every respect demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to be true, being the Magnet of it, is composed of subtle aire, Mummiall spirits, coagulated by an internall and centrall vertue, in the magneticall mass.</p>

                           <p>Against the time that I was to read my publick Anatomy in the College, I had (as our custom is) a certain body of one that was hanged, to be anatomized at my house privately: at which time I was sollicited by Mr. <hi>Kellet,</hi> the Apothecary, to permit a Gentlewoman, who had a Scirrhous tumor in her belly, to be touched and stroked with the dead man's hand, because experience had taught it to be very effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, for the abolishing of the like horrid protuberation in others, as they averred. The Gentlewoman, with her husband and brother, came unto my house, and, as they desired, things were effected. Within a while after the Apothecary, with the Gentlewomans husband, came to give me thanks for that courtesie, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring me, that it had done his wife good, and taken away the tumorous swelling. Now this doth shew, how the contact of this northern Mummy in the dead mans hand, did cause the southerly growing and vegetating tumour, which did more and more send out its beams from the center to the circumference, to decrease and diminish, and caused it to rot and moulder away, by the centrall continuation or union of the northern spirit in the dead, with that which did vegetate unnaturally in the living, and that at a far distance.</p>

                           <head>A third Experiment, to expresse the self-same effect.</head>
                           <p>It is evident, and often approved by common people, that if Warts be rubbed with a piece of fresh beef, and the said beef be conveyed into a field, and buried under the earth, that as the beef wasteth and rotteth in the earth, so will the warts languish and pine away. In like manner it hath been oft observed, that if a piece of bacon be rubbed on warts, and afterwards be nailed on a post against the Sun; as the bacon doth waste and diminish, so also will the warts fade and waste away. Also a dead bodies hand touching warts, they will dye.</p>
                           <p>Whereby is evidently proved, that as things are sympathetically maintained in their being, that is to say, in their increase or vegetation; so also, by an antipatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call aspect, or spirituall continuity, between two remote natures, after a corporall contact is made between them, whereof the one is Boreall, the other Southern or Aequinoctiall, the one which touched, will cause it to fade and vanish, after the nature of the toucher. So that as the northern property is an enemy unto life, and southern heat; so by his contact it causeth unnaturally-growing things to fade away by a like property, in changing the vegetating nature of the thing touched, into his decreasing, contracting, and mortifying nature. The experimentall Glass doth teach us, that the action of cold is quite contrary unto that of heat, in one and the same spirit. And Scripture tells us, (if we will not stand unto experience) that the self-same word in his southern property, doth undo and destroy the snow and ice, which it did make in his northern condition.</p>

                              <hi>Johannes Rhumelius Pharamondus,</hi> cureth the Gowt by the very self-same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of transplantaion in this manner. He cutteth off the hair from the feet, legs, and thighs; and also he pareth off the nails of the feet. Then he maketh a hole in an Oke, even unto the very Center or pith of the body, and pulleth into it the hair and the nails, and afterward he stoppeth up the hole with a peg or pin, framed out of the same Tree; and lastly, he daubeth it without with cow-dung. This Author saith, that by this Magneticall experiment onely he hath cured many. But if it chance (saith he) that the Gowt shall for all this return again, within the space of three months, then it is an Argument that the Oke is insufficient to draw Magnetically: and then he proceedeth thus, namely he boreth another like hole in a second Oke; and after this, he taketh the peeces, of the Oke, which fall out in the boring of the hole, and bruiseth them, and sticheth them in a little bag, and applieh it unto the dolorous or infected member. And this he doth three daies before the New-Moon. Then in that very hour, that the New-Moon is in, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth the bag from the part affected, and thrusteth it into the hole of the same Tree, and stoppeth it with a pin of the same wood, as before. And he affirmeth, that by this second practice, when the first hath failed, he hath cur'd many. But if it happen for all this, that the pain doth return within three other moneths; then he cutteth of the hair, and pareth the nails, the second time, and tieth them upon the back of a Crab, or Crab-fish, and so casteth it into the running waters, and the sick will be cured. He concludeth there, that he hath cured many by the first; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others by the first and second; and many, by the first, second, and third Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments.</p>

He taketh a new laid Egge piping hot (as they say) and he rubbeth the Gowty place with it often, but gently: then he taketh away the bark of a good big tree, and with a great auger, he boreth a hole so big, as that the Egge might easily enter into it; then doth he lay on again the bark as before, stopping well the hole there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with it, and anointing or daubing it with tree wax or caement. All which busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses must be effected in due order and time. And he telleth us, that when the barks

of the tree do grow together, then also will the <hi>Hernia</hi> and rupture also close up. But if it happen that the <hi>Hernia</hi> be not cured within one moneth, then bore a hole in an Oke, and take the pieces that fall from the hole, bruise them, and stick them in a small bag, and apply it to the grief as is said, about three daies before the new Moon; and then about the hour of the new Moon, put it into the hole, and do in all things as is told you before. He telleth many other observations, as well touching the time, namely if the <hi>Hernia</hi>'s first increase, were in the Moon's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease or decrease; which for brevity sake I here omit: Lastly, if the <hi>Hernia</hi> be not for all this so dered or glued up, then he boareth a hole in the Oke, and puts in the nail and hair of the Patient's hands and feet; as also the hair of his privy parts, stopping it as is before said: For he affirmeth that when the hole will be grown up, the <hi>Hernia</hi> will be also closed. There also he sheweth the reason, that he is forced to use more or less of these operations in his cure, according unto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Hernia,</hi> namely to the incipient <hi>Hernia</hi> one operation will serve; to the inveterate more will be required. And he saith, that in this cure is chiefly to be obserued the time, the measure of the tree, and the depth or profundity of the hole.</p>

And therefore it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that there is a Balsamick virtue in these kind of Excrescences; though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ignorant they appeare but of little value.

                           <p>We may rightly compare the mass of these superfluous Excrescences, unto a lesser Load-stone, capped with steel: For when it is transplanted into the Plant, it becommeth of a greater force of attraction: For as the Iron being added unto the pole of the Load-stone, though it be but weak; yet it doth fortifie it, and maketh it able to attract a far greater weight; for the Iron giveth it strength. In like manner, if Magnetick Excrescences, be grafted in the body of the Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Tree; then that Tree will suck and draw his like, namely the spirit of defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive limbs more strongly unto it; making them to become vegetative, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and grow, which before did pine and wither: For the spirit sucked and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by dilatation, from the member unto the vegetative nature of the Tree, doth indue the like nature; and doth by a continuity animate the fading spirits in the member, to increase, and vegetate, or prosper in his growth.

Make a piece of cork round, and as big as a hazel-nut, and pierce it through the center with a reasonable big piece of wier, till the middle of the iron be in the center of the corck: put it into a quiet water to swim in, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it unto its other end very near; but so, that it toucheth it not, the end of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther piece of wier; and you shall see, that the piece you hold in your hand shall draw the other in the cork, so that as you move the one, the other shall slowly follow. And this must be effected by the application of such of their ends, as shall agree in their pole. The Demonstration is this:

                           <p>By these examples therefore it is made evident, how the two spirits of like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, or rather of one identity of nature, are apt and prone by a naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57108:138"/>
to covet and embrace their like, and that at a distance, or space between each body, and consequently, that it is not the bodies that acteth. For they are divided and distant from one another; but the formall spirits, which by an astrall emanation do sympathetically and lovingly, first aspect one another, and then by an equall attraction, do, as it were, kiss and hug together. And therefore it cannot seem strange or impossible unto wise men, that the bloody spirits in the oyntment, and those in the wounded person, should at a far distance meet and apply together, by a sympatheticall aspect, being that they are but one continued and indivisible quintessentiall spirit, though altered in elementary property, even as the northern aire is by the north wind made to differ from the south, though all is but one essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and indivisible aire.</p>

                           <p>Now that the vitall spirits of the wounded animal, do penetrate in the very moment of the stroak into the weapon, and that the weapon doth greedily suck them in; it is proved by this following observation.</p>
                           <p>Some Country Chirurgions, not daring to search some deep wounds with a Probe, do use to take the weapon that made the wound, be it sword, dagger, knife, and such like, and put it into the fire; and though before you saw no difference in the colour of the weapon, yet after it cometh out of the fire, you shall see the place of it that wounded, altered in colour from the other, by reason of such spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits as it did imbibe. This is commonly found true by experience.</p>
                           <p>Another proof to maintain this, is, that if a Viper or Adder be cut with a sword or knife, in peeces, the venomous, odious, and irascible spirit of the Serpent will penetrate into the substance of the steel; which is confirmed by this, namely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that if a man be afterward wounded by this weapon, that did cut and divide the Adder or Viper, it will so invenome the wound, that it will be made incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, except an Antidote made of Adder or Viper be applied: So also the Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being bruised and applied unto the wound, that is made by the Scorpion, will cure it; as also an Oyle made of the same.</p>

                           <p>This is sufficiently proved, by the ocular Demonstrations, recited for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the first member; but more especially by the second Demonstration of the eighth Chapter of this present Book: where I have shewed you, that if a
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57108:138"/>
long Load-stone be divided in the middle, between the two Poles; that is to say, about the aequinoctial line, and each of these divided parts be put to flote in his small vessell or bark on the still water. The influentiall spirit, which is one in essence, and continued between them, doth desire and covet to unite the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded minerall bodies, whose limbs are by a wound or Solution of continuity se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and to reduce them into the naturall estate, they were in at the first; and for that cause B, and C; whereof the one is Meridionall, namely B; and the other Septentrionall, to wit, C, which were at the first continuated parts, but now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, are by that unseparable Spirit, which giveth life unto both the parts, reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, sucked, and drawn together, and reduced unto the estate of their pristine continuity; that is, of two stones they are made one; so that the portion of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in C, draweth and attracteth the bodily B, unto it, and the proportion of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in B, sucketh and inticeth C, unto it: For we must note, that the unity of spirit, doth evermore desire and effect the unity of the body, in which it dwelleth; for the quintessentiall or formall spirit, delighteth not in the variable disposition of the airy spirit, and therefore coveteth to inhabit the close specificall house or pallace, which it did possesse immediatly after his discent from his celestiall starry parents. This is the reason, that one specifick spirit is most easy, yea, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth to communicate with his like; but especially one and the same spirit must needs act with, and never be absent from the other; and therfore when the frozen, Northern, and as it were congealed nature is incited and stirred up, by the aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall or Southern property, if it be rightly adopted; and the Southern Iron's property is touched with the Magneticall North-pole of the other, they will effect attraction the better; and to this purpose speaketh this Problem.</p>

And as we see, that by the concourse in the macrocosmicall aire of the north-wind and the south, both spirits are united into one form, and are magnetically, with their airy vehicle, contracted into a clowd, which containeth in it a formall fire or lightning, and a watry body: So the two emanations do cause a contracted aery spirit in the place of their concourse or application, which doth in his contraction attract the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samick spirit which the oyntment doth send forth; even as we see in the Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass, that the contracted aire sucketh up with it the masse of the water, and yet the aire so contracted is not for all that visible.

                           <p>It is rightly then said, that the Load-stone doth move the Load-stone, and doth both dispose of one another by their primary form, which it receiveth from his starry fountain.

                           <p>Whereby, although it may be replied, that this Act of the Load-stone with the Load-stone, or it with the Iron, doth by effect seem to be limited, within a certain dimension, and therefore what I say, proveth not much as yet, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded dimension of the Magneticall bodie's emanation. I answer, That the sensible act, which is between the Load-stone and Load-stone, doth not argue, that because the two ponderous bodies, have their motion but at such a distance, therefore their spirits can extend themselves, or apply their beams no further: For it is one thing to operate sensibly, by a violent attraction of a heavy mass, and another thing for one Form onely, to embrace and concur in a naturall rejoycing sympathy with another. And this alteration, is verified even of such as are well pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in the Load-stone's property, by this following Problem.</p>

                           <p>Whereby is acknowledged, that the virtuous extention of the Magnet, is farre beyond the limits of the Orbe of visible Magneticall motion.

As for example: Let there be a long Load-stone prepared, and directly in the middle upon the aequinoctial B, where the Axis runneth, plant an incited needle, and it will look directly unto the North-pole A. Also if within the Orbe you place another incited needle without the Stone in C, it will also look directly upon the said Pole: whereby we may discern, the long distance which is between the aspect of the Magnet, and that of the incited body, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 90 Degrees.</p>
                           <p>Again, each part or fragment that is divided from the Magnet, (be it animal, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, or minerall) hath therefore the self-same dimension, because it is as well indued with his polar virtues, as the whole.

                           <p>Whereby it is apparent, that if every portion or fragment of the Load-stone or Iron, have his pole as well as the whole, then the spirit which is within, hath his relation or application with the Northern pole-star of the great world; and doth also behold the Southern Virtue, with his South-pole; for except there were the Scintil of the <hi>Anima mundi,</hi> which is in it and operateth in it, according unto the small proportion of it, no otherwise then it doth in the great world, it could not aspect each Pole, as it is observed by experience to do; and consequently as the actions of the <hi>Anima mundi</hi> are so catholick, that they cannot be limited; so are the spirituall, quintessentiall, or astralicall Emanations.

                           <p>Wherefore it is made manifest, that the extention of the Load-stone's spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or formall Emanation; as also that of other Magneticall bodies, is not to be limited, being that they do act and apply their beams, unto the very state of the Pole-star, and the Pole-star by his like emitted influences, doth operate reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and apply unto or aspect the Load-stone, and so make a continuated Spirituall union betwixt them, being that we ocularly discern, that both it and the Iron, doth diligently, and with a manifest Sympathy aspect, and actually move unto the said star. And then, after this is well considered, let us but think and ponder the distance, which is between the Pole-star and the Magnet, namely betwixt the eighth Sphere, and the earth, and he will perceive it to be in a manner infinite and incommensurable, and consequently the emitted beams of the Load-stone, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any phantasticall Sphere, of sensible and sensuall Philosophers, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended or limited. But if the act of the Pole-star on the Magnet be denied. And <hi>Fracastorius</hi> his opinion, with that of many other learned men, be received, namely that the Load-stone, the Iron, and the needle touched, do tend unto the North-pole, by reason of the attraction of certain Rocks of Load-stone, which are in the <hi>Hyperboreal</hi> mountains; if this opinion (I say) were admitted to be true, yet may we see by it, that the act of the Magnet, and the actuall respect, which the Magneticall body beareth unto it, is not to be limited; being that so they will be observed to co-operate from the aequinoctiall, unto the Northern Hyperborean Rocks. But this opinion hath been proved false by us in another place, and shall hereafter be demonstrated by us to be so. We will now come to our Application, touching this first Article.</p>

                           <p>The first and second Problem teacheth us, that there is such a celestiall or astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall subtle spirit, in all magneticall bodies of the earth, as is in the heavenly ones, and consequently, that the beams of each of them may penetrate as far, though they be not discerned by sense, as the beams of each star. By this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may be assured, that mans heavenly spirit being of a more pure and subtle a stuff, than is that of the Load-stone, may send forth the astralicall beams of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, not onely to the mark that the Load-stone aimeth at, but also unto the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est throne of divinity. Again, hereby it is argued, that the spirit in the transplanted blood, is able to operate at any distance on the wound; and the beamy spirit of the wound again, to co-operate, and have a continuated union and respect unto one another.</p>
                           <p>The third instructeth us, that though the oyntment and blood in it do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear mobil or movable at a far distance, yet they may co-operate and be conjoyned with the spirit of the wounded, at an unknown proportion of space,</p>
                           <p>By the fourth and fifth we learn, that the extension of the northern bloods as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect unto the southern, may be so far, as the aequinoctiall is from the pole, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 90 degrees. But, I say, that as the northern and southern emanation of the soul of the world, filleth all the cavity of the world, so also by it, and in it, may this act of that soul in man extend it self, far beyond the capacity of flesh and blood and therefore is onely intellectually to be understood.</p>
                           <p>By the fifth, that each particle of mans blood, or spirituall Mummy, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from the whole, hath all the parts or proportions in it ideally described, that the whole hath, and therefore doth operate as well with a northern, as southern aspect, and consequently draweth down from the heavens a like property, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is given: For so this one Spirit is said to come from the four winds, and yet it is but one spirit in essence,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.</note> though four-fold in property; for it was by the vertue of it, that the dead, mentioned by the Prophet, did rise again. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so far as the north wind or south winds extension may be, so far is this spirit in man able to send forth his spirituall beam.</p>
                           <p>I will come now unto the proof of the second.</p>
                           <p>Touching the second Article, which sheweth the acute penetration of this spirit, and that it is effected without any impediment, contrary unto some igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant persons opinion, who think, that castles, stones, woods, hills, and such like, may hinder the penetration of this subtle and all-penetrating spirit: The proof is made by these problematicall demonstrations.</p>

                           <p>By this it appeareth, what near reference there is, between the body of Man, which we compare rightly unto the Earth, and the blood which issueth out of the veins of the Earth referred to the Load stone, and the Ointment indued with a bloody spirit, and which was extracted out of blood: For the fat and the Uznea, and Mummy were of blood: For Scriptures tell us, that the Soul of the flesh, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently of the fat and bones, is in the blood. Whereby we may see, that though these three do differ in bodily Substance, yet they agree in the homogeniety of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And therfore it is no marvel, though there is a continuity between the spirit of the bodily blood, and that transplanted; neither also ought we much to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the naturall commerce, which is between the bloody spirits, and the Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that so sudden a union should be made between them, and that it should forthwith become a Magnet, adopted onely in his Balsamick and sanative operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for the wound, being that it is guided and directed by these bloody spirits, which are transplanted in it, and, after animation, did convert the beams of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto his like, being as near in spirit and property unto the wounded man's blood, as is a piece of Iron, or Load-stone, which is broken from off the whole, which accordeth in every respect with the spirit of his Father, from whence it sprung.

                           <p>By a like relation, the weak spirits in the transplanted blood being imbibed by the animal unguent, which hath the self-same relation unto the spirituall Mummy in it, as the oyl of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> hath unto the weak spirits in the Load-stone, will be revived and recreated in his magnetick vigour, and being mingled with his unctuous like, will make a compounded Magnet, which will draw his like spirits more strongly by far, then it could before. Again, as the small or weak Magnet doth recover force, by being buried in the dust, or ferruginous earth, which is of his nature; so also the bloody spirits being interred in the unctuous earth of his own nature, doth by the attraction of his like from the fountain of blood, and of the salutary spirit from the oyntment, so unite it self unto the oyntment, that it createth by emanation a fit Magnet, which communicateth his balsamick nature unto them both, and by attraction of the spirit of the wounded member, it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth it self medicinable; so that by a continuity and integrity of spirit, it confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, through an immediate spirituall contact, the balsamick spirit of the Uznea, and other unctuous ingrediences, into the wound. Do we not observe, that the water which passeth or runneth by a heap of salt, doth endue wholly the vertue of the salt, though the stream of it be long, and doth communicate that nature from one extream unto the other: And much more the aire will carry the nature of the place it passeth by afar off, and yet all that aire so animated, will be continuate, and therefore much more that subtle celestiall spirit which doth inhabit the aire.</p>

                           <p>By this Example it is proved, that the formall Mummy of the blood, operateth in the very like manner with the Oyntment; which is to it, as the Iron is unto the Load-stone; so that as the Load-stone by touching the Iron, maketh it after the imbibition of his spirituall vigor a Magnet; So also after the imbibition of this bloody spirituall Mummy, the unguent becommeth a Magnet: Forasmuch as it is throughly animated with a Magneticall vigor.

And therefore by the externall air's cold, it sucketh spirits from the wound, and leaveth it distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and dolorous, it being by that kind of attraction deprived of some naturall heat.

                           <p>In the Weather-glass, so often mentioned before, you shall find between the bolts-head or mattras above, and the water below, a continued aire in the neck of the glass; and you must imagine, that such included aire is not without his sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous spirits, which by dilatation of themselves, do also dilate the airy vehicle they are in, and with the dilated vehicle the water is stricken down; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of themselves, the airy vehicle is also contracted, and the water is sucked up. And yet we see, that the aire which is between both extreams, is all one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued aire from the one extream unto the other, and therefore much more the occult and celestiall sulphureous spirit, which dwelleth and acteth within it, and is as the soul in a body, <hi>in toto &amp; in qualibet parte,</hi> and that indivisibly, or not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated into parts. And because this included acting spirit being but one in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is derived from the soul of the world, Look as the generall worketh in the great world, namely, from the north or from the south; even so also doth this member of the generall operate in his included aire: For if the catholick spirit of the world acteth or breatheth from the north, and bringeth forth in the air, congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and contractive effects, then the centrall spirit in the glass doth operate likewise after the same manner, for it contracteth his vehicle, and sucketh up the water: But if the world's catholick spirit bloweth from the south, then is the aire, before contracted, now again dilated; and then also will the included formall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the glass operate after the same fashion, and dissipate or extend out their airy vehicle in a larger proportion or manner, as by ocular observation you may discern in the said Instrument.</p>

But this emanating spirit from the north to the equinoctiall, is one and the same spirit in essence, although in property it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth in his parts.

                           <p>We conclude therefore, that the spirit in the wounded man's blood, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted, and that in the blood exhausted, is all one spirit in essence, howsoever it vary in property; and therefore being continuate and indivisible in essence, it is no marvell though it acteth from one extreame unto another diversly, namely Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically and attractively from the Oyntment: for there by reason of its absence from the Southern or lively blood in the body, it indueth a Northern nature, and sucketh or attracteth his like, being emanated in the aire, and the Southern-pole or aequinoctial point by dilatation, sendeth out his spirit to be attracted; and so there is made a communication betwixt the Balsamick nature, and the wounded, the self-same spirit operating diversly. And I will express unto you a notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the great world. When the Sun is beyond the aequinoctial Southward, (which happeneth in the winter) then is the Northern nature most powerfull in attraction, congelation, and inspissation on this side the aequinoctial. As contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise, the Southern nature is most vigorous, and efficacious in dilatation, disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and subtiliation; and yet you shall plainly discern, how one and the same Spirit in the world, doth operate from the one extream unto the other: For when the Sun in the South, doth dilate the aire and the waters there, which the precedent winter had thickened and incrassated by attraction of cold, and by dilatation doth dissipate it, then that aire and water so dissipated, requireth a larger place, and fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the aspect of the Sun Northward. And again, the Northern propertie of the same spirit, being now in the winter time most potent, doth by attraction suck and direct Magnetically, those spirits, which are chased from the South; and the nearer it draweth them unto the pole, the more suddenly it condenseth them into clouds; which by reason of the Sulphureous nature, which it bringeth from the Summer or aequinoctial, do immediatly dissolve themselves into rains. And this is the reason that the Southern winds are so rife among us in the winter, and consequently, that we have so much rain in that season; So that we may see how the double property of one and the same spirit, doth operate at one and the same time, about the effecting of one and the same thing, in one and the same catholick aire of the world: as I have told you before in my foregoing Discourse, As also, in the ascending or descending of fountains in each Hemisphere, the like is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. All which is most lively demonstrated and performed in the Weather-glass; as I have expressed before. Whereby it is confirmed, that being the Microcosmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call spirit is all one in condition, with the Macrocosmicall.

                              </gap>t though the body of it be divided, yet the spirit remains indivisible, and can dilate and contract it self at any extention; as is proved by the properties of the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds, whose spirit is continued from both extremities; and by the small pieces in the Load-stone, which have their compleat poles as well as the whole. Also by this, a man way see, that this spirit's operation, is not to be limited by any of the Peripateticks imaginary Sphere of activity, and consequently that it may work at any distance, being directed and guided by a right and homogeniall Magnet; that is to say, agreeing at the least-wise in speciality, if not in individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality or both; as the blood of the wounded, which is transplanted, and that in the body, both which are identity in nature; and also as is the <hi>Uznea,</hi> and Mummy in the Oyntment, which is of the same Specifick, though not of the Individuall.</p>
                           <p>You see therefore (Learned Reader) how plainly this business, or the fore-said Proposition, hath been demonstrated, as well by the Load-stone, as the naturall practise in the great world, and in practise of the Weather-glass; which I term

                           <p>It hath been observed, in the cure of wounds, by the Weapon-salve, that if there happen in the time of the cure, any issue of blood from some other part of the wounded man, as bleeding at the nose, pissing of blood, or by some other wound; or else if he have to do with any menstruous woman in the mean time, the force of the Ointment will be diverted, and the efficacy of it will stand but in little stead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the reason that I can give, is, because the Southern bloody spirit, which, raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the veins, did emit and direct his beams unto the Oyntment, was easily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and imbibed by the Oyntment: but when that spirit is diverted and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned another way, and is attracted by a contrary Magneticall Subject; then will a divorce, as it were, be made by the second Magnet, betwixt the emanating Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the attractive in the Oyntment.

                           <p>Thus you see, how fitly these two do concur, namely the fore-recited animal act, with these of the mineral. I end this Chapter with this Assertion. Spirits that have their subtiliation and action from natural heat, do act livelily; so long as they abide within the sensible Orbe of Light's calefacting beams, being stirred up <hi>a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro ad circumferentiam.</hi> But if the said Spirits depart or wander out of the Orbe of Light, and are environed by the cold act of darknes, then they contract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Circumference unto the Center, and so resting in the Center, do cease to act except they be incited or provoked by the virtue of heat, which doth subtiliate, and by subtiliation make both extreames alike. As is proved by the Weather-glass, and by blood issuing out of the wound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is said before. Wherefore I will boldly conclude, that the spirits of the blood, conveyed either in the body of the blood, or sucked up into the wounding weapon, or in a stick, knitting-needle, probe, or such-like; may be evoked, extracted, or revived, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto his fountain; partly by preserving it from the externall aire's inclemency, till it be dissevered by comfortable warm heat of his kind; and partly by the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coition, or concurrence, and conjunction of his like, by a favourable and salutary aspect. I have been (I fear me) too tedious in this Chapter; and yet not longer than the business doth rightly deserve; considering how the world hath been puzzelled, and all Philosophers put to their wits end, about the due search and enquiry of this curing exploit: Forasmuch as they in the concluson, were able to say so little, and to demonstrate less to prove this manner of cure to be naturall; that they gave way without controlement, unto the rash and temerarious cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of such self-conceited persons, as would (forsooth) have this kind of cure, to be onely Cacomagicall, and Diabolicall; which they insultingly go about therefore to maintain; because great appearing Philosophers, which did write in the defence of this Subject, could say so little, and to so small purpose unto the contrary. I will speak a few words concerning some other Histories, which are, and may be referred unto the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same manner of cure.</p>

                           <head>An experimentall history to confirm this.</head>
                           <p>There is a Noble-man of no mean ranck, and very wise, religious, and one of the best esteem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who useth commonly to cure the yellow Jaundies at the distance sometimes (as he hath related it unto me) of an hundred miles, and that onely by means of the sick parties urine translated unto him, and the manner is this: He taketh the ashes of a certain Tree, commonly known among us here in <hi>England,</hi> and mingleth the urine with it, and causeth his man to mould it up in the form of a paste, the which is divided into lumps, which he causeth to be framed up into 3, 7, or 9 balls, and in the top of each of the said balls he maketh a hole, and puts a blade of Saffron into each hole, and so filleth up the hole with the said urine; and then he putteth or disposeth these balls into a secret place, where no body may meddle with them, and immediately the Jaundies in the patient, be he further or nearer off from the place of the medicine, will by little &amp; little fade and wear away. And this experiment hath been tryed on above a hundred poor and rich, and many of them were such as Physitians have dispaired of. This not onely he, but also the noble Ladies his daughters, who, for Gods sake, have in this case done good to many poor people, do affirm to be true. And thus much I can affirm my self, that being called unto a Chirurgions wife, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1637. after that other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors had been with her, but to little purpose, who was filthily infected with this disease; and having used some medicines, but to little purpose, at her request, I sent her man into the country with a Letter unto that noble personage, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his help: But in the interim that the urine was sent, the woman was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by some sincere fools, that it was witch-craft, which made her half mad, and to rave, and to use her man hardly at his return: Whereupon I sent a messenger forthwith to desire his Lordship, to undo what he had caused to be done, because of the ingratitude of the woman. He sent me word, that he would; But, said he, it will be but in vain, for it will cure her, do now what I can: And indeed she mended immediately upon it. Also there was a noble Lady, daughter unto a Lord, who was much infected with the same disease, and finding that usuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies in Physick did her little or no good, I sent her water unto the said noble Earle, who did his endeavour: But when I found, that the disease did stick still upon her, though her urine did amend in colour, I took horse, and did certifie that noble personage of the small effect the medicine had. He wished me to send it again, and the sick Lady did send her water the second time, and did forthwith begin to mend, and within a few daies was perfectly well. There is another, who, unto my knowledge, hath cured forty of this disease, by boyling of their water or urine away on a gentle fire; things (God he knoweth) far enough from either su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition or witchery.</p>

                           <p>And therefore much more the serous matter which is separated from the blood, because the essentiall vegetable salt of the blood in the specifick, in which are some scintills or sparks, is mingled with it; and by vertue of them, there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuated sympathy or respect between the salt and sulphure in the balls, and the infected blood: For (as I proved in the precedent Chapter) the spirit in the urine is as continuated with that in the blood, as was the spirit of the wounded and the oyntment; so that by a continuity and union of consent, the curative faculty of the vegetable ashes doth operate spiritually, as well upon the infected blood in the body, as upon the urine; and therefore that is the reason, that as the salt in the ashes do work on the salt in the urine, so do both of them communicate their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by a mutuall consent, through the reason of the same continuity, unto the blood; so that as the vertue of the plant with the Saffron do kill and poison the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the urine; so also, by the mutuall consent which is betwixt the two infecting extreams, namely, the blood and the urine, the infection also in the blood is observed by little and little to dye, wither, and decay.

                           <p>I need not to say much more for the proof hereof, being that the precedent Chapter doth fully confirm, and that by relation had unto the Load-stone, and Weather-glass, in every particle of this Proposition, being that as blood is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted from the wounded parties fountain of blood, and, as it were, grafted on the oyntment; so also is the urine with bloody spirits, transferred from the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fountain in the icteritious person, and is planted or placed in a bed of salutary ashes, from whence it operateth no otherwise in the living blood, then the blood or spirits in the oyntment do, in the veins of the wounded person.</p>

                           <p>We term this the Microcosmicall Magnet, because it hath the properties of the Minerall Load-stone. And it may therefore easily be conjectured and guessed, by such as are wise in their apprehension, what it is, by comparing the animal Magnet with that of the Minerall: For as the Minerall Magnet is not of a naturall, but monstrous birth, for it is not engendred of like and equall Genitors; but is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten after the manner of the Mule, being that her mother or passive corporeal mass, is a common Saturnine and stony <hi>Mercury</hi>; but his Father or active Form, is a Metalline, Sulphurous, Martial spirit; So also this our Microcosmicall Magnet doth consist of a Sulphurous Martial spirit, being as it were his Formal Father; and of a strange or forrein <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is nevertheless, a near neighbour in position, and condition unto the Microcosmicall <hi>Mercury,</hi> as his passive or Mercuriall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

                           <p>As for the manner of its application, it is this; We take the Magnet so prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and, if we would extract the Animal's Mummiall spirits, we must apply it unto those places, which are aptest for their evacuation. As for example: If we desire the Mummy of the vitall parts, then we must adapt our Magnet to suck at that place, which nature hath ordained to purge the vitall region. Lastly, if we would have the naturall spirituall Mummy, we must apply it unto that place of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, out of which nature is accustomed to send forth the spirituall fumes, or swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty evacuations from that member, namely from the Liver. To conclude, if you would make a generall Medicine, which should respect the animal, vitall, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall parts, all at once; then must your Magnet be applied unto them all, and after that it hath sucked a sufficient proportion, then ought you to reserve it, for to make your Transplantation.</p>

                           <head>The Act of Transplantation of the Spirituall Mummy.</head>
                           <p>Touching the act or manner of Transplantation: <hi>Paracelsus</hi> saith, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted spirituall Mummy doth not ooperate unto health and preservation, but by mineral, vegetable, and animal means. And therefore it is necessary, that the spirituall Mummy attracted, or extracted out of the body, by the virtue of the Animal Magnet, must be introduced into a vegetative nature; whereby the said Mummy, not being of it self vegetative, may by adoption as it were be introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into, and be indued with a vegetative nature or condition.</p>
                           <p>We ought therefore to mingle a proportion of this imbibed Magnet, with a certain proportion of his mother-earth, and sow in this composition the seeds of such herbs, as are proper for thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for example: For the Lungs in the vitall region, when the disease is the Ptifick, sow Line-seed or Juniper, in the naturall region; when it is Dropsy, Pimpnel or wormwood; in the bruising or contusion of parts, <hi>Hypericon</hi> or Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; in tumour or wounds, <hi>Persecaria,</hi> or the great or lesser Cumfry; in Salt diseases as are the tooth-ach, pain in the eies, and flowing Menstrues, <hi>Persecaria maculata,</hi> and so forth. The herbs must grow in this compounded earth, and that in the open aire: and as the herb or plant groweth, it will sympathetically and Magnetically extract the imbibed Mummiall spirits out of the Magnet, and will by that means cause the Mummy extracted out of every particular member, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto his condition, to be fit to cure the infirmity of his proper member.</p>

                           <head>Of the Use and Virtue of the Transplanted Mummy.</head>
                           <p>Lastly, as concerning the manner how to use this Transplanted Mummy, now that it is changed into a vegetable nature or condition:</p>
                           <p>If the disease be dry and of a combust nature, as is the yellow Jaunders, the Ptisick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and you would cure it or expell it out of the body; then take the herb with his Magnetick earth, and cast them into the running water, and the disease will fade and die, by little and little.</p>
                           <p>But if the disease be moist, then you must burn the herb, with the Magneticall earth. Again, if the disease be more temperate, namely between the extremities of water and fire; then hang up the herb in the aire, or smoak, to dry; and the disease will languish by little and little, as the herb doth fade. If you shall give the herb or fruit unto the beast that is of a stronger nature than the sick, then the beast will be infected with that disease, and the sick will be free. Also if the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Mummy so extracted, out of some peculiar member of a sound Man, be
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:57108:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conserved in his continuall vegetation, if you take of his fruit, and transplant it into a sound oken tree, by that means the member out of which the Mummy was extracted, will grow continually, and continue in his naturall and robust pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of vegetation, without defect. After this manner also, are the Willow trees, but that they increase so suddenly, and by reason thereof, they are not so fit for this purpose, lest the member should grow too hastily, for by that means, many inconveniences may follow: As for example, If after that manner the hair of a person be shut up into a willow-tree, they will grow so suddenly and so copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, that unless they be removed thence, or the Willow be burned, the eyes and brains will indure dammage and detriment, as dolours, fluxes, &amp;c. namely, by the suddain increase, or too much humidity of the Tree. And therefore according unto the proportion of the person, there must be a proportionate tree found out, into the which the Mummy is to be transplanted; but the Oke is to be elected before all others, because it increaseth and groweth but temperately and strongly, and a mans life will not easily exceed the daies of an Oke.</p>
                           <p>By this mysticall kind of attraction, the true and wise naturall Magician, (for so I may call the true Philosopher, that operateth, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did, by the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of naturall things) may bring to pass such things, which in wonder will excell (as I said) by many degrees, the power or act of the weapon-salve; for by it, wise men have procured friendship &amp; love, between such as have been utter enemies; &amp; again, by the use of it, grace and affection may be recovered from another, whose favour is desired. <hi>Paracelsus</hi> speaking darkly of this Mummiall faculty, doth shew, how the Ape and the Snake (betwixt the which, a naturall antipathy, or strife and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, is ever observed to be) may be made friends, and familiar unto one another. But to our purpose.</p>
                           <p>If the members out of the which the second Mummy is extracted, are to be corroborated, then you must make the extracted Mummy to vegetate, as before, by transplantation temperately, and according unto the naturall proportion in the Oke, or other such like sound tree. But if the members be too dry, then let their extracted Mummy vegetate in the Willow tree, and from thence again be transplanted into some other temperate Tree. So also in a humid complexion, it may for a time be transplanted into a hot and slowly growing tree, as is the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper; onely observing, that the fruit in which the Mummy is transplanted, be preserved from all externall dammage.</p>

And therefore, for the manifestation of this hidden action, by a relation of natures, I refer you unto that very place also, where the salve is compared unto the vegetable and Magnet, the bloody spirits unto the spirituall Mummy, the manner of application of beams from the Mummy to the sick member, unto the application of the transplanted bloody spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to the wounded member; the keeping the spiritually-growing spirit in the oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from cold, unto the preserving the vegetable fruit, in which the Mummy is planted, from externall damage.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is certain, that like doth naturally affect his like; for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth rejoyce at the presence of his nature, and nature doth correct and corroborate his nature, if it be sound, and full of vivifying and wholsome spirits: So also nature, if it be poysoned and infected by a venomous nature, will, by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it self unto a sound and wholsome nature, quickly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and inquinate it, and so by such a kind of abortive and depraved union, antipathy is placed insteed of sympathy. Now how this is possible in nature, I will in few words relate unto you. As na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth magnetically effect and allure unto it her like; so, if that like which it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ucketh unto it be inquinated with corruption, the said attracting spirit, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so sound, will quickly taste of the bitter with the sweet, namely, of the poyson, and so will also be corrupt equally with that spirit, which is homogeneall unto it, in which the infection dwelleth, being forced unawares to entertain strife, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention, and antipathy into his tabernacle unawares; even as we see a sound spirit in the Animal, which thirsting after his like spirituall celestiall food, which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth occultly in the aire, to be refreshed by it, doth unawares draw in an enemy with it, namely, a pestilent and corrupt fume, whereby it is oppressed and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a putredinous fire; so that it was not the appetite or desire of the sound spirit to draw in that poyson unto it, but the spirit like it self that was poysoned. And again, each spirit which is incumbered with any antipatheticall and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall accident, desireth to shake off contentious antipathy, and to re-assume that peacefull sympathy which it enjoyed before; but finding it self unable, it is apt to cleave and adhere unto good and sound spirits for its relief, being that <hi>vis unita fortior</hi>; and if more sound spirits of his like were joyned unto it, then might it the easilier conquer and expell his antipatheticall adversary. So also we see, that one blear-ey'd person, by darting his infectious beams for relief at a reasonable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, becommeth a flame, which setteth on fire the sound spirit unto the which it applieth: for spirituall poysons are like secret flames of malignant fire. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as spirits are by union joyned together and multiplyed, like oyle added unto oyle, so doth the infectious flame increase, and feed equally upon them both: For as the sound spirit desireth the society of his like, to comfort it, and the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted spirit so desired, doth also covet the sound spirit to assist it against his enemy. So corruption is sucked in by them both, and antipathy is forced to roust among them, and forsaketh them not, untill it hath penetrated and gnawed into even their bowells, and poysoned their very entralls. And we must note, that there is no poysoned spirit that doth sooner take hold of a spirit, then such as is specifick,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57108:152"/>
and of a homogeneal nature: For that is the reason, that one Mans spirit being infected with the Plague, doth so multiply it in his kind chiefly; as also the Murren doth chiefly rage in the spirits of Sheep, and medles not with the spirits of Men. Do we not commonly see, that a like nature being altered by putrefaction, is most deadly unto his like? So worms avoided out of the body, and dried to pouder, do by inward administration kill the worms. Spitle that is avoided from the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi> cureth after preparation, the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The stone of the Kidney or Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by calcination cureth and dissolveth the Stone. The touch of a dead man's hand cureth the schirrous tumors. The Scorpion being bruised, or his body mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in oyle, cureth the wounds of the Scorpion; and the oyle of the Viper; as also the trochises of his flesh, the bitings of the Adder or Viper; dead and congealed blood, and the salt excrescence out of man's bones, is antipatheticall unto the flowing blood: In conclusion, there is nothing that is more powerfull to check or correct an impediment in a spirit, then by applying of the same Specifick spirit, being altered from his nature by a contrariety; So also there is nothing that infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth a sound nature sooner, than a nature homogeneal unto it self, which hath indued corruption; and that is the reason, that the infirm and corrupted Mummy of one man, is so apt to putrify and corrupt that of another, as we may not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discern by these words of <hi>Paracelsus: Corrupta Mummia, corpus etiam sanum quod attingit,</hi>

My answer is, That all these things, though in themselves they are venomous, yet being rightly handled and used by wise men, they are made passing medicinable. And I would have them know, that God created all things good; but it is the Divell and his instruments, who by ill imploying of them do make them odious, and detestable unto mans nature: For as by their right use and application, they may produce sympatheticall effects: so by their abuse they produce nothing else but antipatheticall actions, and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conflicts with man's nature: God, I say, ordained them for a good use, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for man's health; but the Divell doth apply them destructively, and malitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which also the foresaid wise naturall Magician, <hi>Solomon,</hi> confirmeth in these words:<note place="margin">Sap. 14.2.23.</note> God created all things that they should exist and be; and he made all the Nations of the Earth sound and durable; so that there was not a destructive medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in them. Also God created Man inexterminable; but it was by the malice of the Divell, that death entered into the world. And the wicked imitate him and are of his seed. Whereby it is plain, that it was the Divell, and naughty men, which are his instruments, and indeed true Divells incarnate, which do adapt that for a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked use, which indeed is good and righteous in it self: What shall I say more? what? because that the Divell doth apply a good thing unto a bad use, must that thing for ever be abhorred and eschewed of wise men? And must for that reason the good use thereof be excommunicated out of man's society, and be for ever after reputed for Cacomagicall, damnable, and diabolicall? As for example: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Divell and his adherents, I mean the witches and Necromancers, do by the Divel's instructions, apply the Mummy of man as well corporall as spirituall, about their pernicious and destructive inventions: Therefore must all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57108:153"/>
the evill which the properties of naturall things may effect, by an unnaturall or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipatheticall adaptation, needs put that evill in execution unto the prejudice of mans health? Verily, if things are rightly considered, the knowledge of good and evill in the creatures, do well befit the science of a Physitian, for except he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the evill as well as the good, how is it possible to cure the harms which are effected by the bad, being that except the cause be known, the effect wil hardly or never be cured. As for example, If the nature of the spirituall philtre which infecteth, be not discovered, how should the cure be performed, or the cause be extinguished or taken away? The true Magitian doth not intrude into the science of the Simples venomous nature, to do harm thereby, but to discern the counter-poyson which should prevent the mischief thereof, as the Scorpion cureth the Scorpions, the Viper the Vipers harms. Must every man that hath a sword needs kill, or do a mischief with it? May he not defend another from being killed or harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? So also it followeth not, that he must therefore poyson his patient, because he knoweth the poyson, and the manner how to correct or amend his malice, which hath deprived his patient of his health. Except the poyson be known, the <hi>Alexipharmicon</hi> or counter poyson will hardly be had. If the Hermit of <hi>Aix</hi> (of whom I have spoken before) had not known the especiall antidote to cure those, which he had poysoned and infected with the pestilence, many of those which he afterwards cured would have died with the rest.

There are Saints as well as there are devills on the earth, who being acquainted with the impious inventions and devices of these devills, with their arch-master Satan, are able to challenge and combat them at their own weapons. Schollars learn of <hi>Aristotle</hi> the art of sophistry and fallacy, not that they should deceive, but that they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent deceipt and the honest, and most skilfull and faithfull Physitian, prieth into the mystery of the most spirituall poyson, not with an intent to poyson, or do any evill by it, but that he may with the greater assurance, and vigorous efficacy, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the cure, and take away the cause after it is known; for the nature of the poyson being well understood the cure will be the more certain. The venomous wound of the Viper (as I have said) is cured by the Theriacall antidote, into whose composition the flesh of Vipers doth enter; the oyle of Scorpions, or the Scorpion of it self being bruised, doth cure the sting of the Scorpion, and that by a magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall attraction of his like. All which being so, why should not the wise Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian look into the nature of spirituall venoms, as well as the spirituall counter-poysons that are in man. When we find, that the venom that woundeth, is, by reason of his homogeniety in nature, the perfectest Magnet to suck and draw unto it his like? If by the sound Mummy in man, I can cure or take away the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or venom, which his like nature hath accidentally imbibed, is it not a fit and convenient thing to know the one as well as the other.</p>

From this experiment, many egregious abuses may and would be effected by wicked men, if this manner of diverting the creatures vertue from good to bad, were known unto them; for by it, they may disseminate agues and the pestilence over a whole Country: for the plant will suck out the spirituall Mummy of such persons, as are infected with such venomous diseases, by reason of its vegetating activity.
