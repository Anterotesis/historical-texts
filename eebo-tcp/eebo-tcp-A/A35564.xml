         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have by the help of a Friend, lately received your
Letter to me, which you have publiſhed with
ſome other pieces of yours. Had I apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
any difficulty in the buſineſs, I could have
found an excuſe, from my preſent indiſpoſition
of body, which hath been upon me this long
time. But I think I ſhall not need much Study,
to anſwer you; this Letter, I mean. I will not
inſiſt upon perſonal things, which do not at all concern the cauſe it
ſelf, no further than civility doth oblige me.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you challenge me (ſo I underſtand you) of ſomekind of
<hi>breach of friendſhip.</hi> A great crime, I ſhall acknowledge it, if truly
guilty. But the truth is: Now that you have put me in mind by
thoſe circumſtances you mention, I remember well, when Bp.
<hi>Morton</hi> (of Reverend and Bleſſed memory) lived in <hi>Durham-houſe,</hi>
(which was at the beginning of the late Troubles) there was a civil
Gentleman in the Houſe, (whether in the quality of <hi>Chaplain,</hi> or <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,</hi>
I do not remember) with whom I did walk ſome time: but
what our communication was, about <hi>Religion,</hi> or any thing elſe, I can
give no account. It ſhould ſeem by your Letter, you are the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
But whether this may be called <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> or <hi>Friendſhip,</hi>
I know not. For ſince that time (ſo many years ago) I never
heard of you, that I remember: neither did I think my ſelf by any
<hi>Law of friendſhip</hi> (ſuch as this) obliged to inquire. If your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of me, and my name, hath been more tenacious; I wiſh you much
good of it: I have often grieved, that mine is no better. If it were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101247:3"/>
your kindneſs, to think of me, when I did not of you; I am behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you for it. But how I ſhould know, 20 years after, that <hi>S. W.</hi>
the Author of SCHISM DISPATCHT (now turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>I. S.</hi> in <hi>Sure Footing,</hi> &amp;c. which I proſeſs I do not underſtand:)
was the party whom I had ſeen in <hi>Durham-houſe,</hi> eſpecially after
ſo much trouble of body, and mind, which thoſe times did occaſion,
I will leave it to your further conſideration, I proteſt to you ſeriouſly,
that neither by any information I have had from any body elſe; nor
by any ſuſpition of mine; I never had the leaſt thought of any ſuch
thing.</p>
            <p>Before I enter into the cauſe; I will make an end of this buſineſs,
of our <hi>acquaintance.</hi> You charge me at the end of your Letter, that
I was acceſſory to your <hi>change.</hi> Truly Sir, becauſe I acknowledge
we did talke together, but can give no account of particulars, in any
thing that I think, (as my mind and my apprehenſion of things then
was; which I remember very well:) could poſſibly proceed from
me; ſo far I may and will, in civility believe you: But to believe that
I ſaid any thing to you, wittingly and willingly, which I knew to be
falſe and fictitious, contrary to my ſenſe and judgement; and this too,
to no end at all, that is, without any provocation, or inducement, but
to do my ſelf hunt; when, for ought I knew, what I ſaid to you,
might probably come to the knowledge of that Reverend Prelate,
a zealous Proteſtant, and who entirely loved me; you muſt pardon
me, Sir, if I believe you not in this, but abſolutely deny it, and offer
my ſelf to take my oath to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I am not willing to believe, that you willfully <hi>deviſe,</hi>
but rather, that your <hi>memory</hi> hath deceived you; I will ſee what I
can do to help you.</p>
            <p>Firſt then you ſay, I told you, <hi>They were mad, who read the antient
Fathers, and ſaw not, that they meant Chriſt was as really in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember it was once, by a Jeſuite, laid to my Fathers charge pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely;
that he ſhould write ſomewhere, in the margin of a book writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by a learned Proteſtant, where he treateth of the Euchariſt: <hi>Omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamus
Patres: nam corum authoritate velle uti ad noſtram ſententiam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmandam,
eſt exquiſitiſsimo genere inſanioe inſanire.</hi> Though the words
might be juſtified (being written haſtily too) if by <hi>noſtram ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101247:3"/>
we underſtand them, who make a meer figure of the Sacrament.
Yet I ſhall not need to fly to that; in caſe it be granted, theſe words
were written by my Father. For there was a time, (and I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
it, in a book dedicated to King <hi>James,</hi> that learned and
religious King, above 40 years ago:) when my Father, who then
followed other ſtudies, was very much ſet upon by Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi>
in matters of Religion: neither could he avoid it, becauſe it was by
order from the King. What opinion you, or any others now, have
of the Cardinal, I know not: but he was then generally accounted
the greateſt Wit, and moſt Eloquent man of his time. And I can
ſhew, how at that time my Father did write many things from his
mouth, (ſo expreſly acknowledged by him) for his remembrance;
which afterwards, upon further peruſal and conſideration, himſelf, in
the ſame paper, condemned and conſuted. I have at this time by
me, a very conſiderable Collection of ſuch <hi>Notes;</hi> and had them
when I anſwered the Jeſuite. No wonder then, if he had written
ſuch words at that time; who afterwards, at more leiſure, took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
pains to ſatisfie himſelf about that matter, having examined all
the Teſtimonies of Antient Fathers, and Records of all Ages, of
that Argument, with great accuracy; which Work of his had been
publiſhed ſoon after his <hi>Exercitations,</hi> if he had lived. No wonder
then, I ſay. However, I had no reaſon to believe it then, upon his
report, whom (the Jeſuite, I mean, before ſpoken of) in other things
I had found very bold, and partial; to ſay no more. But afterwards,
it was my luck in the King (now <hi>Charles</hi> the Second our Gracious
Lord and Soveraign) his Library, at <hi>St. James's,</hi> (where for ought
I know it is ſtill) to light upon the book, and I do acknowledge, I
found the words there. Now the thing being in a manner publick
already, though not, perchance, ſo publickly known; it is poſſible
I might ſay ſomewhat of it to you, (the word, <hi>mad,</hi> makes me think
I did) who, probably, being before reſolved, were willing
upon very little ground, as I conceive, to make ſome advantage
of it.</p>
            <p>And how much leſs, I pray, as to the matter of the Euchariſt,
doth <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf ſay, in that paſſage by me produced in the book
you mention; <hi>Subſtantiam</hi> vcri corports &amp; ſanguinis Jeſu Chriſti utì ex
utero Virginis illam ſemel accepit, Proeſentem eſſe in cana tam ſidelibus,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101247:4"/>
               <hi>quàm infidelibus,</hi> which paſſage is out of his Epiſtles? But many
other, to the ſame purpoſe, may be collected out of his other works,
as that, <hi>Idem Corpus, quod paſſum eſt pro nobis:</hi> and, <hi>Subſtantia Chriſti,
manentis in coelig;lo, arcanâ vi nobis communicatur:</hi> and the like. So
that you have no reaſon to except againſt <hi>Calvins</hi> interpretation of
the <hi>reality,</hi> except you deny God that power, (for <hi>Calvin</hi> makes it
a great Miracle) to exhibit the body and blood of Chriſt, truly and
really; and yet ſpiritually which, I think, is not more incredible;
than <hi>a corporeal</hi> preſence, and yet <hi>inviſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sure I am, and can ſhew it under his hand in more then one place;
my Father was well pleaſed with <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine, in this point.
Judge you therefore, how likely it is, I ſhould tell you, your ſecond
objection) that either Father or Grand-father, did hear <hi>Calvin</hi> ſay,
<hi>He would willingly cut off one of his fingers, on condition he had never
written what he had written, concerning that Sacrament, or that kind
of Reality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſay you, if I can help you in this alſo? I am very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
I can. For this I can ſhew you, or any body elſe, written with
my Father's own hand; that a Perſon of Credit and Integrity, as
he believed, and one that had been very intimate with Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi>
had heard him ſay, <hi>Dolere ſibi vehementiſſimè, quod uſus exhibendoelig;
Euchariſtioelig; morientibus eſſet ſublatus. Et affirmabat (idem) ſemel
audiviſſe Calvinum, orto ſuper eâre ſermone, dicentem, Optare ſe ut
ſibi unus è manu digitus eſſet proelig;ciſus et ille uſus eſſet reſtitutus; ſed ſe
reverentiâ earum Eccleſiarum, quoelig; uſum bunc damnant, impedirl,
quò minus de eo reſtitaendo cogitaret.</hi> Here, you ſee, <hi>Calvin</hi> doth
profeſs his grief, wiſhes one of the fingers of his hand cut off, on a
<hi>condition:</hi> gives a reaſon, why he cannot help it: All this, you
have. Your miſtake is about the <hi>Subject:</hi> you ſay, <hi>reality;</hi> which was,
according to the true Relation, <hi>the denying of the Sacrament to dying
perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, you ſee how willing I am to ſave you from ſuſpition of wilful
falſhood. For otherwiſe I might have thought it enough abſolutely
to deny, what you lay to my charge. I might have done it with a
good Conſcience; and I think my <hi>negative,</hi> with impartial judges,
would have carried as much ſhew of probability as your <hi>affirmative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The matter of friendſhip and private talk anſwered; your next
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101247:4"/>
charge is, that I have ſhewed my ſelf <hi>an abſolute ſtranger to Science;</hi>
and withal very <hi>uncivilly injurious,</hi> without any need or provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Firſt, <hi>an abſolute ſtranger to Science</hi> (if I miſtake you not)
becauſe I ſlight ſo much your way of <hi>infallibility,</hi> in matters of <hi>faith;</hi>
which you ſo much extoll, as grounded upon <hi>ſelf-evidence,</hi> upon
principles of <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>nature;</hi> ſo demonſtrable, that nothing in the
world can be more.</p>
            <p>Then ſecondly, <hi>injuriouſly uncivill:</hi> in what? Firſt, in the <hi>harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of the <hi>terms,</hi> whereby I expreſs my <hi>Judgment:</hi> and ſecondly,
in wrongfully, or ſtanderouſly <hi>impoſing</hi> upon you things, or words
which you never wrote, you ſay. Now, ſir, will you pleaſe, laying
aſide all paſſion, as I ſhall endeavour in this anſwer, to hear what
I have to ſay my ſelf: and it may be you will be of another
Judgement. I will not tye my ſelf to your <hi>order;</hi> but as neer
as I can, I will not leave any part of your <hi>charge</hi> unanſwered.</p>
            <p>Firſt then I ſay: Your book <hi>Schiſm Diſpatcht,</hi> came to my hands
from a learned Gentleman, who deſired me to look upon it at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
intimating that it was much cryed up by ſome men of your
ſide. He was pleaſed to give it me, and tied me to no time. At
laſt, the time came; I was at leiſure. You may believe me, as you
pleaſe: I ſhall onely deſire, if you think it reaſonable, that you
will not judge till you have read all. I have naturally a great
antipathy to <hi>Fanaticks</hi> and <hi>Fanatick</hi> opinions. I look upon them,
as the great enemies of mankind; that is, of true religion, and
civil government. You know what this Kingdome hath lately ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by them, and how neer it came to utter deſtruction. When
I had read your opinion, of <hi>Orall Tradition,</hi> (a thing, as you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
it, I had never met with, nor heard of before:) <hi>upon which</hi>
you would have us to ground our <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>without which</hi> you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
no <hi>right Chriſtianity;</hi> I profeſs I took you for either a
right <hi>fanatick;</hi> or one, who cunningly did endeavour to undermine
all religion. But of the two, rather, I thought, a <hi>fanatick.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I had any juſt ground for ſuch an opinion, or ſuſpicion ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
I ſhall by and by further ſatisfie you: in the mean time, think
of me as you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>I could not but think the worſe of you too, for handling that pious
worthy man, againſt whom you write, ſo unhandſomely. An ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101247:5"/>
man, would love worth: and a good Chriſtian, piety even in
an enemy. I know you give him ſome good words in your
firſt <hi>Chapter:</hi> but in your Preface; in you: <hi>book</hi> generally, and at the <hi>end</hi>
of your book, where you pretend to reckon his faults; truly, Sir,
though confidence, I know, and high language goes a great way
with them, that cannot judge; and might be proper enough to
your end; ſuch ſcorn, ſuch petulancy, did not become you.
Theſe two conſiderations, without any particular grudge, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation;
made me, I confeſs, ſomewhat beyond my ordinary
ſtraine, or <hi>genius,</hi> to expreſs my ſelf, in delivering my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now, in the next place, give you ſome <hi>reaſons</hi> for
my Judgment. But I will firſt ſee how I can acquit my ſelf from
impoſing upon you, and miſ-relating your words. Before I wrote,
what I have written, (where you are mentioned:) I had read
(in part, for it is a great book, you know:) Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> his
anſwer, intituled, <hi>The Diſpatcher Diſpatched.</hi> I ſuppoſed he had
read you more at leiſure, (indeed I never did, but here and there
by parcels:) than I had done. Beſides, I found ſome others, to
whom you referr us, and from whom you profeſs to have learned;
mentioned by him; and their words often quoted, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with yours. I had them not; never ſaw them; much leſs,
read them. That he would or could miſtake, or miſrelate you;
or them; ſo candid and judicious a man, as he was; I had not
the leaſt ſuſpicion. This made me leſs heedfull, whether I uſed
your own words, <hi>preciſely;</hi> and in your <hi>own order,</hi> or <hi>method;</hi> ſo
as I ſet down nothing, but what was <hi>your ſenſe</hi> and <hi>meaning;</hi>
clearly to be gathered from your own words. Sure I am, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it no otherwiſe; and I am yet very confident, if I have laid
no more to your charge, then Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath done, to you
and to thoſe others, which concurr with you in the ſame opinion;
I have done you no wrong. For, as I take it; the queſtion is
not, Whether you <hi>proteſt againſt</hi> your <hi>abſurdities,</hi> ſometimes;
and ſeem to diſclaim them, in words: (which is ordinary enough,
to writors; eſpecially, when they have an uncouth opinion, or
aſſertion, to make good:) but, Whether you have <hi>poſitively decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
your ſelf, this, or this, to be your <hi>opinion;</hi> and, Whether that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101247:5"/>
be not the <hi>principal end,</hi> and <hi>ſcope</hi> of your <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> To maintain
ſuch an opinion. If therefore you take the advantage of any
words, caſually miſplaced; or of pages miſ-quoted, to criminate:
this is not to <hi>criminate,</hi> properly; but to <hi>cavil.</hi> Give me leave
therefore to remind you, (for I profeſs I did partly rely upon him,
and upon thoſe grounds I have mentioned, I thought I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſo to do:) how he (Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>) upon accurate examination
of what you had written, and ſome others had written, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
your opinion: and it was ſome argument to me, that you
did not think your ſelf <hi>wronged</hi> by him, becauſe I never heard of
any <hi>anſwer</hi> that you had made. However, it ſhall be upon this
condition, that if I cannot make good my <hi>charge</hi> to the full, from
what you have written, and <hi>I</hi> have read, ſince; <hi>I</hi> will make no
advantage at all of his words.</p>
            <p>Firſt then; the main buſineſs, as <hi>I</hi> conceive; what you mean
by <hi>Orall tradition: Orall Tradition is that, (faith Mr. White;</hi> they
are Doctor <hi>Hammonds</hi> words:) <hi>which the mothers flatter into their
children: and is the moſt ſweet and connatural way that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
to beget a firm and undoubted aſſent: and this,</hi> (faith Doctor
<hi>Hammond,</hi> from you both) <hi>if not excluſively; yet, comparatively,
ſo, as to carry it clearly from Scripture, and Fathers, which are but
dead letters, and mute writing in compariſon of this, which alone he
looks on, as Gods living word.</hi> This then is your opinion. That
all the aſſurance we have of our Faith, and the onely thing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
ſtands upon, is by this teaching <hi>of flattering mothers;</hi> or
in your words, <hi>of fathers and mothers of families.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>
faith; <hi>if not excluſively.</hi> But whatever you do in <hi>Schiſm Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht:</hi>
(where nevertheleſs you plainly enough exclude Scripture
and Fathers, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> doth elſe where tell you:) it is apparent,
that in your <hi>Sure footing,</hi> you do very poſitively exclude both Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Fathers: as when you ſay, <hi>There is no arguing againſt Tradition,
out of Scripture:</hi> and that <hi>none canin reaſon oppoſe the authority of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Councils, againſt Tradition.</hi> Inſomuch that you will not allow
Chriſts <hi>promiſe</hi> to his Church, (which both Proteſtants and Papiſts, if
true Chriſtians, have ſo much relied on, and found ſo much comfort in:)
to bear <hi>any part in the Rule of Faith:</hi> that is, (what elſe you mean;
<hi>by Rule of Faith: I</hi> cannot tell) to be truſted to, as certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101247:6"/>
without your <hi>Tradition:</hi> Nor allow us to ſay, that
<hi>Tradition</hi> is certain, becauſe Chriſt hath promiſed it; no further
than can be made good, or demonſtrated by principles of nature,
and ſuch <hi>Mediums</hi> as you call <hi>intrinſecal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> particularly, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> doth give us this
account, that never any <hi>Romaniſt, Jew, Heathen,</hi> or <hi>Mahumetan,</hi>
hath <hi>attempted</hi> the like againſt them, to bring their credit down;
as <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> hath done in his <hi>Dialogues,</hi> to eſtabliſh this <hi>Oral
Tradition,</hi> which you maintain. And if the ſame (though truly <hi>I</hi>
do not ſee what can be done more, by any) be not done, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
by you: yet you are anſwerable for what is done by <hi>Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
in thoſe <hi>Dialogues,</hi> becauſe you refer to him, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
and that both are engaged in one cauſe, which doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
you, if not to ſay, yet to think no leſs.</p>
            <p>Another thing which doth much add to my wondring and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
is, the <hi>newneſs</hi> of your way: the conſequences whereof
is, that if this way have not been known to former ages till this
late diſcovery, it muſt of neceſſity follow, (and your <hi>Corollaries</hi>
acknowledg it) that Chriſt hath had no Church all this while:
no people, or nation upon Earth, that could be called <hi>faithfull.</hi>
You indeed, for the moſt part, cunningly hide, as much as you
can, the monſtrouſneſs of your Doctrine, under the generall
word of <hi>Tradition;</hi> which you know both <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>
under ſeveral notions; or in the ſame notion, with
ſome limitations; do own and acknowledge: though you ſtill
underſtand but one thing, by that word: that is, <hi>the teaching
of flattering mothers,</hi> in every age. Of mothers, <hi>I</hi> ſay, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, it ſeems, you moſt rely, becauſe Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who
hath read all your books, doth moſt keep to thoſe terms; but, of
<hi>Fathers and Mothers of Families,</hi> if you will, as you expreſſe it.
So you tell us in a place, <hi>this way (of Tradition) is the way
every Catholick in the whole Church, none excepted, holds and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</hi>
your way therefore, not a new way: as if a man would prove,
that a dogg is a man, becauſe both dog and man, are Animals. All
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> hold <hi>Tradition;</hi> therefore they hold the <hi>Tradition of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Mothers;</hi> that, and none but that, as the onely <hi>foundation</hi>
of their <hi>faith:</hi> for ſo it muſt be underſtood, or elſe you ſay nothing.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101247:6"/>
Now, by Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> account (as I find in Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>) the firſt
invention, or beginning of this, was <hi>in a ſleight familiar conference</hi>
(afterwards exalted to no leſs, then <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> or <hi>Inſpiration;</hi>
you ſhall know what I mean, by and by:) which made Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>
ſay, that this Diſcovery of Mr. <hi>Whites, as it is the greateſt bleſſing,
the richeſt jewel; ſo it is the greateſt riddle and myſtery in the world.</hi>
And again to propoſe it to his Readers conſideration, <hi>Whether it be
credible, that ſo great a Jewel as this pretends to be, ſhould be withheld
from the Chriſtian world for above 1600 years, and at laſt brought
forth, not onely by one man that pretends not to inſpiration,</hi> (then he
did not, it ſeems) <hi>but alſo in a ſleight familiar conference, between
two Kinſmen.</hi> So that if Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who made it his ſtudy, and
had read all your Books, (as was ſaid before) did not ignorantly
<hi>miſtake,</hi> or wilfully <hi>falſifie,</hi> as you charge me; what can be more horrid,
and monſtious? And then again, by your own <hi>Corollaries; That
body of men, who adhere to Tradition, (Oral</hi> ſtill, that is <hi>the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Fathers and Mothers of Families:) can evidence clearly and
plainly, who are truly faithfull, who not,—who are of the Church,
who not:</hi> pag 97, 98. And again; <hi>No company of men hang together
like a body of a Chriſtian Church, or Common-wealth, but that which
adheres to Tradition:</hi> p. 99. By theſe <hi>Corollaries,</hi> I ſay, it is clear,
and muſt of neceſſity follow, that till this way of <hi>Tradition</hi> was hatcht,
(whether new, or old) Chriſt had no Church, no faithfull People in
the World.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Conſequence</hi> of your Doctrine is <hi>horrible;</hi> ſo the <hi>Doctrine</hi>
it ſelf, both at firſt hearing, and the more a man looks into it, (if
he have the patience) with reaſon and judgment, no leſs <hi>prodigious,</hi>
and <hi>incredible.</hi> The Doctrine of <hi>Faith,</hi> on which Gods Catholick
Church is founded; true <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> on which depends Eternity of
bliſs, or miſery; to be preſerved in every Age, ſound and entire;
and ſo conveighed from Age to Age; by <hi>Fathers and Mothers of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies?</hi>
This, the way, and the onely way God hath appointed,
and Mankind muſt truſt unto? It is far from my thoughts, in this
ſhort <hi>Anſwer</hi> to your <hi>Letter,</hi> to reaſon the caſe with you, by way of
<hi>Confutation;</hi> there be ſome about it, you tell me, who I hope will
make you ſenſible, how miſerably you are miſtaken in your grounds.
Give me leave onely to inſiſt a while, on the <hi>monſtrouſneſs</hi> of your
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101247:7"/>
               <hi>Opinion,</hi> as it doth appear unto me. You know the World is much
amended generally, in point of <hi>knowledge,</hi> within theſe hundred, or
two hundred years. Who hath not heard of that admirable
or <hi>regeneration</hi> of Learning, by all kind of Writers, ſince, or
about that time, ſo much extolled and magnified? Let Pope <hi>Leo</hi>
the X. who then was, and his Cardinals, have a great part (under
God) of the thanks, if you will; I am not againſt it: though by
the <hi>averſneſs</hi> you ſhew frequently to <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> I doubt
you will be more ready to <hi>curſe,</hi> than to <hi>bleſs</hi> them for it. But durſt
you, even now, undertake, that every twentieth or fiftieth man, or
woman generally, among you, is able to give an account of their
Faith? I will not ſay <hi>rational,</hi> but <hi>reaſonable,</hi> ſo that they may
deſerve the name of <hi>ſound Chriſtians,</hi> in the main <hi>Fundamentals,</hi>
wherein we, for the moſt part, agree? <hi>England,</hi> I think, I may
ſay, (not to diſparage others) is furniſhed, and hath been theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years, with as able Miniſters, as any Nation can boaſt of in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
I have been a Miniſter and Preacher here theſe Forty years,
and above: I know what I have found, to my grief, in more places
then one. We may thank the <hi>Puritans</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> if it be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
whoſe endeavour hath alwayes been in all places, to ſet up
their <hi>Lectures,</hi> and <hi>Pulpit-Preaching,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Catechiſing;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Three moneths right <hi>Catechiſing,</hi> will make more Chriſtians, I
am confident, then Forty years <hi>Pulpit-Preaching.</hi> Do not think, I
pray, to take any advantage of this, and tell me, Though it be ſo
among us <hi>Hereticks;</hi> yet, you thank God, it is otherwiſe, among
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> as you call your ſelves: For I could tell you ſtrange
things, from your own Writers, men who never were ſuſpected, in
the leaſt degree, to favour <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> concerning your Preachers;
what manner of men they are commonly: how able, or how carefull
to diſcharge their duties. I will name but one to you, (till you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
more) <hi>Laurentius Villavineentius, Doct. Theol. De reite formando
ſtudio Theol.</hi> which Book (though not that particular paſſage of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters)
he did almoſt <hi>verbatim</hi> tranſcribe out of <hi>Hipperius, a Proteſtant;</hi>
though otherwiſe, a virulent inveigher againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as any I
have read. Read him there; but eſpecially, <hi>De ſacris Concioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
formandis,</hi> Lib. I. c. 2. and I think you will ſay, you have
your belly full. So now: Will you have a fight of <hi>former times,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101247:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from unqueſtionable <hi>Records?</hi> In the dayes of <hi>Alfrid,</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the ignorance of the Land was ſuch generally, that himſelf
complaineth in his <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Gregories</hi> Paſtoral, <hi>Chriſtianity was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an empty name, without any ſubſtance, or reality.</hi> And <hi>Aſſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
one of his Maſters, in his life, doth relate that it was a long time
before he could read, becauſe he could get none to teach him; though
he much deſired it. Some ſix or ſevenſcore years before, when
<hi>Cuthbert</hi> was Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> King of the
<hi>Mercit,</hi> or Middle-land Counties, a Synod was held at <hi>Clyff,</hi> by
which it was ordained, that (for the time to come) <hi>All Prieſts ſhould
learn the Creed, and the Lord Prayer, that they might be able to teach
them to others.</hi> So in <hi>England:</hi> How elſewhere? In the dayes of
<hi>Charles</hi> the Great, in <hi>France,</hi> there were ſo many ignorant Prieſts,
that a Law, or <hi>Capitulum,</hi> was made for the <hi>rebaptization of ſuch, as
had not been baptized in the Name of the Father, the Son,</hi> (a hard
Leſſon, it ſeems, for the Prieſts of thoſe dayes) <hi>and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
Yet we deny not, but the worſt dayes afforded ſome men of worth:
but what the generality was, we may gueſs by theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>I have read a Book intituled, <hi>Fragmenta Caroli Magni,</hi> printed at
<hi>Antwerp,</hi> A. D. 1560. in a place it treateth of the <hi>ancient manner,</hi>
as the marginal Note doth import, of chooſing Biſhops. Firſt he
is choſen, <hi>à Cleroſen Populo;</hi> that is, <hi>by the Clergy, and the People,</hi>
according to the language of thoſe times: Then he is preſented to
the <hi>Apoſtolick:</hi> (that is, the Pope) for conſecration. Then faith
the Record, (<hi>Pontifex jubet inquiri de quatuor Capitulis Canonicis;</hi>)
<hi>Inquiſition is made concerning the four Canonical Articles;</hi> by which it
ſeems, the capacity or incapacity of men, for ſuch a degree, was wont in
thoſe days, chiefly, or in the firſt place, to be judged: The firſt is;
Whether he had not been <hi>Arſanoquita,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>a Sodomite?</hi>)
The ſecond, Whether he had not lain with a Nun? The third, with
a Beaſt? The fourth, Whether he had not married one, that had
been married before; or a Widow? <hi>Et de his inculpabilis inventus, &amp;c.</hi>
and being found innocent in theſe, he further takes an Oath, he will
be ſo for the time to come. Some few more queſtions being asked,
(among which I find none, except it be included in <hi>Dimiſſoria ab E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopo;</hi>
concerning his ſufficiency, in point of Learning:) he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
the next day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:101247:8"/>
I could tell you of <hi>Italy,</hi> and other places. But, by this, I hope,
you will give me leave to ask you; What you think of the <hi>Fathers
and Mothers of Families,</hi> of thoſe times; in what a capacity they
may probably be ſuppoſed to have been, to <hi>preſerve</hi> and <hi>tranſmit
ſound Chriſtianity,</hi> without any further helps of <hi>written Word,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi>
unto poſterity? Ordinary <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> I know, when they are
put to it, about the Popes <hi>Infallibility;</hi> they fly to Chriſt his <hi>Promiſe,</hi>
and peculiar <hi>Providence:</hi> which is a good plea, could they prove by
<hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>true Tradition,</hi> (that is, the conſent of <hi>Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>)
that ſuch <hi>infallibility</hi> was ever promiſed by Chriſt, unto the
<hi>Pope:</hi> Which to ſay, your friend, and <hi>Maſter</hi> (as I find him ſtiled,
in Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>) Mr. <hi>White, doth reſolve to be Heretical;</hi> yea, <hi>archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heretical;</hi>
where, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> will tell you, <hi>p.</hi> 263. for I have not
the Book. But a plauſible plea, however, I ſay, as it pretends to
ground upon Chriſts <hi>Promiſe,</hi> but not your plea, becauſe you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
Chriſts <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and all plea of a peculiar Providence, as a
principle to be grounded upon: Is not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to you?</p>
            <p>One thing I muſt grant to you, that <hi>your way,</hi> though few <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi>
I think, will acknowledge it their way; is no <hi>new</hi> way, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.
For it was indeed the <hi>Heathens way,</hi> as is objected unto them
by ancient Fathers; which they made uſe of, to uphold their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm,
againſt Chriſtianity: and what thoſe Ancient Fathers
thought of that way, you may read in them, or may be told by
others, in due time. It was alſo the very way the <hi>infidel Jews</hi> uſed,
as by others hath been obſerved, by which they endeavour, to this
day, to juſt fie their infidelity. I cannot ſay, it is the way of the
<hi>Mahametans,</hi> as yet: they have ſomewhat elſe to plead for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<hi>Succeſs,</hi> and <hi>Multitude.</hi> But this I can ſay, whenever it ſhall
pleaſe the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> to make uſe of this way, who now can plead
above a thouſand years <hi>Oral Tradition;</hi> you leave us no way how to
deal with them; how to confute them. And have not you well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
of Chriſtianity?</p>
            <p>But again; do not we ſee that a great part of the Chriſtian world,
(the greater part I may ſay, if you allow them not Chriſtians, who
are not under the Pope;) where once Chriſtianity flouriſhed, hath
already failed, notwithſtanding Tradition? Thoſe flouriſhing Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

What ſecurity have you from principles of Nature, which you onely
allow of; that the ſame may not befall theſe Churches alſo, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
pleas of Divine Promiſe, or Providence, being laid aſide, as
you would have them?</p>
            <p>Sir, be not offended, I pray, with my plain dealing. I have no
deſire to anger you. What I thought of your <hi>Opinion</hi> before, I have
told you. But ſince the reading of your <hi>Sure footing;</hi> what I did
but ſuſpect, before; ſeems now to me, very apparent and viſible.
Firſt, I conſider your <hi>language,</hi> ſuch as this, for example: [<hi>Seeing
by this time, that my Diſcourſe, by ſtooping from my firſt principles,
while I applied them to my buſineſs, ſeem'd immerſt in matter; and by
the blunder of many more and more particular Terms, then were in the
meer Principle, forcibly taken in, began to look with a contingent Face;</hi>
(<hi>though indeed I ſtill perch'd upon the ſpecifical nature of things, and
ſo never flagg'd below the ſphere of ſcience,</hi>) <hi>therefore,</hi> &amp;c.] Then
ſecondly, your <hi>Confidence,</hi> as though, if your opinion ſhould not
prove true, the whole courſe of Nature were in danger to be turned
back, and the Elements to return to their original Chaos: for to this
purpoſe, you often expreſs your ſelf. And then: <hi>I fear not the gates
of Hell;</hi> (for which you chooſe rather to truſt to the ſtrength of
your own wit; than to Chriſts Promiſe:) and, <hi>Hence I ſet</hi> TRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DITION
<hi>on her Throne;</hi> and the like. Thirdly and laſtly, your
<hi>Science, certain ſenſe, ſelf-evidence, intrinſecal mediums, connexion
of cauſes, demonſtration, principles of Nature,</hi> and the like; which
you inculcate in every page, as though <hi>ſcience</hi> and <hi>demonſtration</hi>
were <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> and <hi>ſleep</hi> to you, and you lived by nothing elſe;
Whereas (let me be accounted mad, I am willing, if it be not true:)
all that you ground upon; your principles; (as you apply them:)
your reaſons, your conſequences, are ſo ridiculous, and childiſh, and
ſenſeleſs, that a man may with as much probability undertake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all Story, all Truth, all Religion, to <hi>Eſops</hi> Fables; as to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
your Doctrine to Senſe and Reaſon. Believe me, Sir, theſe be
ſhrewd Arguments of a diſtemper, which is not ordinary. I could
tell you of pregnant inſtances, but I doubt you would not thank me.</p>
            <p>But above all things, Mr. <hi>White,</hi> (whoſe Scholar you have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
your ſelf. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> doth tell me, in this new Device;)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101247:9"/>
let his caſe awaken you, and make you (if it be not too late) ſenſible
of yours. It cannot be unknown to you, I believe: but becauſe this
<hi>Anſwer,</hi> (as your <hi>Letter</hi>) may come to the hands of others, who
know it not; give me leave to ſet it down here. This good man then,
(a rational man otherwiſe, it cannot be denied: what he hath written
againſt <hi>Apparitions,</hi> and falſe <hi>Miracles,</hi> not to ſpeak of his other
Works, which I have not ſeen; ſhew him to be ſo:) being, it ſeems,
highly conceited of his parts and performancess, fell into a conceit,
That God himſelf, by immediate inſpiration, had inſpired him in all
he had written; of <hi>Religion,</hi> eſpecially: and moreover, that God,
to the end all men ſhould know and believe he was indeed inſpired,
and by what they now ſaw, might judge of his other Works by him
publiſhed; had wrought a great miracle (upon himſelf) viſible and
apparent, able to ſatisfie any rational man. I ſay <hi>miracle.</hi> Yet true it
is, and I muſt take notice of it, leſt I hear of it afterwards, as a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator;</hi>
that Mr. <hi>White,</hi> where he doth begin his ſtory, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
ſomewhat, which he cunningly foreſaw, might be objected; doth
ſay ſomewhat, to decline the preſumption of a <hi>miracle,</hi> as not ſo
proper in this buſineſs; but, how agreeably to the reſt of his tale,
and to his concluſion, <hi>Quod ſupereſt, tibi conſule, &amp; oſtentum à coelo
ad te delapſum, ne contemnito;</hi> let the indifferent Reader judge. Now
the <hi>miracle,</hi> (or <hi>oſtentum,</hi> which you will:) as himſelf relates it. is;
That whereas, neither by Books, nor by Maſters, he never had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
himſelf to the ſtudy of <hi>Geometry,</hi> ſo as to think himſelf, or to
be accounted by others, a man of <hi>skill</hi> in the Art of Science: God,
on a ſudden, had made him a perfect <hi>Mathematician:</hi> ſo perfect a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician,
that he took upon him to reſolve greateſt doubts in that
Art, which had poſed the wits of greateſt Mathematicians in all Ages;
as particularly, the <hi>Quadratura Circuli.</hi> With what ſucceſs, I will
not take upon me to judge: but one of his own profeſſion, in point of
Religion, hath told him and others; in an <hi>Anſwer,</hi> titled, <hi>Querela
Geometrie:</hi> who, <hi>pag.</hi> 40, 41. doth conclude in theſe words: That,
<hi>whereas Mr.</hi> White <hi>aimed to be accounted a perſon, whom Almighty God
particularly deſigned to uſe as his inſtrument, for the governing of his
Church, in this preſent conjuncture; and to this effect, to have received
great light, and infuſed knowledge from him; (as we heard him ſpeak in
his Preface:) he hath now given ſuch a Character of himſelf, that it is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101247:9"/>
impoſſible any man ſhould be ſo ſimple, &amp;c.</hi> Who alſo, for the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
further ſatisfaction, hath reprinted Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> whole <hi>Preface</hi> to
his Book, titled, <hi>Tutela Geometrica;</hi> both in <hi>Latin,</hi> at it was written,
and in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> tranſlated by himſelf; where the Reader, if he pleaſe,
may find ſuch expreſſions of deepeſt <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> or <hi>Infatuation;</hi> as
can ſcarce be parallelled out of any Book, now extant, and written
by a Chriſtian; that I can, at this preſent, call to mind. Of any
Book, I mean, written and publiſhed by the Author, or <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi>
himſelf. For otherwiſe, ſtories of <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> their high language,
great brags, and confidence; yea actions, and deportment, ſuitable
to their words, even unto death; we have good ſtore. Whether
Mr. <hi>White,</hi> ſince that, become to himſelf again; (as to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
I mean. For a man may be out of <hi>reaſon;</hi> out of his <hi>witts,</hi> I will
not ſay; in ſome one particular, through much <hi>intention:</hi> who yet
in other things, may be very ſober and rational: it is a known caſe
among Phyſicians:) or indeed, whether alive or dead, I know not;
you do, I ſuppoſe. Me thinks this <hi>example</hi> ſhould be a <hi>warning</hi> to
you, to make you ſenſible of your caſe; more then thoſe <hi>great Wits,</hi>
you ſo often tell us of, (who perchance look upon you, as a <hi>crazy
man,</hi> and think it Charity not to offend you:) their applauſe, to
confirm you in your diſtemper. If I had ſo much intereſt in you, as
ſome have; I know what advice I would give you: if, that <hi>mentis gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimus
error,</hi> (as the Poet expreſſes it) which ordinarily doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
ſuch diſtempers, have not taken too deep root. To tell
you truth; that whole paſſage of yours in your <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>Advice</hi> to
your <hi>Anſwerer, p.</hi> 14. <hi>I eaſily yeeld to thoſe great diſcourſers,</hi> &amp;c. I do
not like. Your language is modeſt enough, were it in another cauſe:
but in ſuch a cauſe as this, (your opinion, I mean:) ſuch ſtudy,
ſuch ſedulity, yea ſuch zeal, as you there mention; muſt needs do
you great wrong. Sir, the worſt I wiſh you, is, that, you may be
ſenſible of your caſe, before it be too late: and the beſt I can wiſh
to our cauſe; were it lawfull, or charitable, to wiſh hurt unto any,
that good may come of it; is, that all <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who meddle with
<hi>Controverſies,</hi> were of your mind and opinion; which I make no
queſtion, but all men truly rational, on either ſide, would look upon,
as the <hi>ultimus conatus,</hi> (a pittifull one, God knowes) of a dying Cauſe:
as to reaſon, I mean, and <hi>good authority,</hi> either of <hi>Scripture</hi> or of <hi>Ancient
Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:101247:10"/>
Now I come to particulars, in the order I find them. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
you ſay (the Popes perſonal <hi>Infallibility</hi>) is not the
thing you <hi>build</hi> upon: and therefore not very ſollicitous, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of it. You do not, it may be; and Mr. <hi>Whyte</hi> doth not:
but <hi>others</hi> of your <hi>profeſſion,</hi> both for number and account, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
the greater part, (who perchance will think I do them
wrong, to call you <hi>a part:</hi>) tell us otherwiſe, and make it their <hi>chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Article.</hi> Of this, ſomewhat hath been ſaid by me, in my late
booke; and it is the opinion of divers others, <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>
that it is the main point, or Controverſie: till you have
diſproved this, I need to ſay no more. Now if you, and Mr. <hi>Whyte,</hi>
and ſome more, whom you think conſiderable, or a conſiderable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
be of another opinion; and think it <hi>Heretical,</hi> or <hi>Archihere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi>
to maintain the contrary; what occaſion you <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have
to boaſt of your good <hi>agreement,</hi> who are of ſuch <hi>different</hi> beliefe, in
main <hi>fundamentals;</hi> I leave to you to conſider.</p>
            <p>But was not this a ſufficient ground (which you call my miſtake)
ſince you diſpaired, and gave over <hi>this,</hi> which others of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<hi>built</hi> ſo much upon; to make you, (ſince you would not be
ſo ingenuous, or had not ſo much light yet, as to acknowledg your
error, and return to us) to make you look about, I ſay, to find
<hi>ſomewhat elſe,</hi> that you might <hi>build</hi> ſo many ſtrange practiſes, and
opinions of your <hi>Church</hi> upon; for which you know, and partly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
you have no ground at all, or at leaſt, not ſufficient
ground, either in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or what we call <hi>Tradition;</hi> that is,
the <hi>conſent</hi> of <hi>Ancient Fathers?</hi> I ſay no more.</p>
            <p>In the next place, you endavour to countenance your <hi>new way</hi> though
not under the notion of <hi>new</hi>) by the temper of the times, which
hath produced ſo many <hi>attempting witts.</hi> Truly, Sir, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
but your opinion or way, hath much of the temper of the times;
be it ſpoken without any diſparagement, or diſreſpect, to any
of reall worth; whether you call them <hi>Witts,</hi> or otherwiſe. Not
to ſpeak of <hi>England,</hi> leſt I may be thought, to aime at any,
particularly; you cannot but know, by report, and by books,
that in ſome places beyond the Seas, there is a ſect of men, who take
upon them to be the onely <hi>Witts</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and glory in that
title; whoſe chieſeſt <hi>Witt</hi> is, to make a <hi>mock</hi> of all <hi>Religion,</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101247:10"/>
to <hi>ſcoff</hi> at the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> which the dulleſt Complexions, if they
make it their ſtudy, are very capable of; and indeed, rather deſerve
the name of <hi>Boufons</hi> (ſome, naturally have a faculty that way, who
are good for little elſe) then <hi>Wits.</hi> You might better have forborn
that word, (which you often uſe) when you tell us of men of <hi>real
worth.</hi> I am not ſo addicted to <hi>old things,</hi> though you make me ſo;
but I can embrace <hi>new,</hi> with thanks and congratulation, when I ſhall
ſee juſt cauſe. Their attempt, or project, I profeſs, I do not like,
who to make themſelves the more admired, trample over all, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ages, which produced ſo many excellent wits, had in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
and eſteem, under the notion of <hi>Learning,</hi> or Science. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
though ſome innovation in matter of humane <hi>Learning,</hi> or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
may be born; yet in ſuch a <hi>fundamental</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> as you
make your <hi>way</hi> to be; no man truly ſenſible of Religion, but will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr
it. It is the ready way to no Religion at all; or, to any; and
you know many account them the onely <hi>Witts</hi> ſhall I ſay, or wiſe men
of the world, that are of that temper. I will not ſay, it is your <hi>end;</hi>
but that it will be the <hi>effect</hi> of your <hi>new</hi> way (give me leave to call it,
as I find it:) ſhould it prevail, (which God forbid) I have much
reaſon to believe. As for the reſt, that you object; I have ſaid it
before, but I muſt repeat it: You play the Sophiſter too groſly, and
abuſe your Reader ſhamefully, when you tell us, Your <hi>way</hi> is not <hi>new,</hi>
becauſe the ancients of <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis,</hi> I have given you a
particular account; I wonder you would name him:) maintain <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
There is as much difference between that <hi>Tradition,</hi> which
they maintain, and that which you do; as there is between a brute,
and a man, though both be <hi>animalia.</hi> Neither will that help you;
to ſay they maintain (ſome may ſpeak ſo) <hi>Tradition, unwritten;</hi>
therefore, <hi>oral</hi> For it may be ſo called, in regard of the firſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
or Authors; though, ſince that, recorded, and atteſted by
multiplicity of Authors. And though there were no ſuch atteſtation
extant, (which cannot be ſaid of true <hi>Tradition</hi>) yet ſtill you are as
much to ſeek, to bring it to <hi>Fathers and Mothers of Families</hi> in your
ſenſe, which ſeem confident, never came into any mans mind, till
you, or Mr. <hi>Whyte</hi> dreamed it: of all other inventions, in this kind, the
moſt ridiculous, I ever heard of. So much of <hi>miſtake,</hi> laid to my charge.</p>
            <p>Now to the <hi>injuries</hi> you complain of. The firſt is, That I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101247:11"/>
my ſelt <hi>a ſtranger to</hi> Ruſhworths <hi>Dialogues;</hi> and that I make
ſome doubt whether <hi>Schiſme Diſpatcht,</hi> and <hi>Ruſhworths Dialogues,</hi>
might not be of one Author, though under two names. Your deſcant
upon this, is, <hi>my genius doth not incline me to trade in books, that
pretend to reaſon.</hi> You do <hi>pretend,</hi> indeed, and ſo do moſt in your
caſe, with as much, or more confidence, (ordinarily:) though the
matter appear never ſo ridiculous to others, and falſe; as the moſt
rational, in beſt cauſes. <hi>As in our Engliſh ſtory, he that could not
confirm his new Revelations by miracles,</hi> (Mr. <hi>White's</hi> miracle, it
ſeems, you do not much truſt to:) <hi>endeavoured to do it, by ſtrong
aſſeverations, and from thence proceeded to Oaths and Execrations,
againſt himſelf, if it were not true: &amp;c.</hi> ſo D. <hi>Hammond</hi> tells you, you
know where. You are not come to <hi>Oaths and Execrations,</hi> I am glad of it:
for then we ſhould be forced to ſtop our eares: inſtead of them, we hear
of ſtrong <hi>aſſeverations,</hi> of <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>nature;</hi> and <hi>connexion of
cauſes.</hi> and <hi>demonſtrations:</hi> theſe we may hear, and laugh. The
Doctor, it ſeems, by this application, began to ſuſpect ſomewhat,
which I do more then ſuſpect. But <hi>I</hi> believe had he ſeen your
<hi>Sure footing,</hi> and theſe pretty <hi>Corollaries;</hi> he had never taken ſo
much pains to conſute you, as he hath done. But he alſo I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
made ſome queſtion, whether <hi>Ruſhworths Dialogues,</hi> the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi>
and the <hi>Diſpatcher,</hi> were three, or one.</p>
            <p>The next injury; I charge you, <hi>you make nothing of, and diſclaim
the teſtimonies of Popes, and Prelates,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay ſo; you ſay, you do
not; in that very page, it may be; but all that you have written, doth
tend unto this, and you do it eminently, in your <hi>Corollaries,</hi> page
100, 101. Still provided, that <hi>Tradition</hi> be taken in your ſenſe, for
<hi>orall tradition,</hi> (that is, the inſtruction and catechiſing of <hi>fathers</hi> and
<hi>mothers of families</hi>) in oppoſition to <hi>written.</hi> And ſo you explain
your ſelf, <hi>Schiſm Diſp.</hi> p. 47. <hi>To Stop the way againſt the voluntary
miſtakes of mine adverſaries, I declare my ſelf to ſpeak here, not of
written tradition, to be ſought for in the Scriptures and Fathers, which
lyes open to ſo many cavills and exceptions; but of orall tradition.</hi> All
the reſt of your accuſation, is but words, and impertinencies; which I
will not ſpend time upon.</p>
            <p>To this may the third alſo, (which you call <hi>injurie</hi>) be referred;
That I charge you, <hi>you ſlight Scriptures, Fathers, and Councils as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101247:11"/>
and call them in ſcorn, wordiſh teſtimonies.</hi> It is not your bare
profeſſing, you reſpect and honour them, in ſuch and ſuch a ſenſe,
that will ſerve the turn. The greateſt Rebell in the world may tell
his King, he doth <hi>honour him;</hi> as he is a Man, perchance; Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
made after his Image, &amp;c. when he hath a knife in his hand,
to ſtab and murder him, as a King. So you deal with the <hi>Scripture,</hi>
you caſt upon it all the dirt and ſcorn you can; as <hi>Scripture,</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral:
you call it, a <hi>dead dumb letter</hi> (what do you think of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
in the mean time?) you make it to be of no uſe at all, as <hi>to the
rule of faith,</hi> or deciding of controverſies of <hi>religion.</hi> But if <hi>fathers
and mothers of families</hi> tell you; that underſtood (in points of <hi>faith</hi>)
in this and that ſence, it is good Scripture, and the word of God; then it
ſhall be Scripture with you, and not till then. As for other uſes, which
godly people might make of them (ſo highly recommended unto all
people by the Ancients, upon that ſcore:) thoſe uſes you take away
alſo, whilſt you forbid them to read them. But this, you will ſay, doth
not concern <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> properly: in ſo doing, you do no more,
then other Papiſts. But then I muſt tell you, it doth not a little ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
the caſe, that <hi>flattering mothers</hi> ſhould be truſted by you for
the conveyance of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> (ſound and ſincere) and the true
ſence of <hi>Scripture,</hi> (in things controverted) to poſterity and ſo many
brought up to learning, and ſo much more rational and intell gent, not
allowed (where the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> reigneth, eſpecially:) the uſe of them,
for fear they turn <hi>hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I proceed; you charge me, I call ordinary <hi>Citations, teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
though many <hi>citations</hi> have nothing in them of a <hi>teſtimony.</hi> True;
but he that cites, commonly, doth intend his <hi>citation,</hi> as a confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſomewhat that he ſaith, and ſo it becomes a <hi>teſtimony,</hi> in a larger
ſence, as the word is commonly taken in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> for example, and
others, <hi>Teſtimonia Patrum;</hi> any words of theirs, are ſo called though
never intended for ſuch by the authors; nor attired in the formality
of a <hi>teſtimony. I</hi> wonder you ſhould ſtick at ſuch a thing: but you may
as wel' wonder, I take notice of it.</p>
            <p>The fourth <hi>injury;</hi> I ſay, <hi>the onely thing you place infallibility in, is Oral
Tradition and the Teſtimonies of fathers of families.</hi> Have not you told
us many times you admit of nothing, to have any part <hi>in the rule of faith
but Oral Tradition?</hi> Do not you upon that account, exclude Chriſts
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101247:12"/>
               <hi>promiſe</hi> to his Church? Do not you forbid your adverſaries, to uſe
<hi>dead teſtimonies,</hi> (that is, <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils:</hi>) <hi>or ſome book granted
to be ſacred?</hi> yea, elſewhere, expreſsly, any <hi>kind</hi> of teſtimony, either
from <hi>Scripture, Councils, Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> except your <hi>Oral Tradition</hi>
be firſt granted to you; which granted, all teſtimonies become uſelſs?
Is not this your buſineſs every where, that <hi>tradition</hi> (your <hi>tradition</hi>)
is the onely thing, againſt which nothing muſt be heard, and which
onely gives credit unto all other things; ſuch credit, as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of? You would make a man hope ſometimes, that you begin to
be ſenſible of the abſurdity of your doctrine, which makes you ſo often
ſay, and unſay, and contradict your ſelf. But I fear, it is not ſo well,
but rather, that you are afraid to offend your party, and therefore
write ſo variouſly and inconſiſtently. You ſay, you place <hi>infallibility</hi> in
other things too, though you make that the greateſt. Either you
<hi>aquivocate</hi> in the word, <hi>Infallibility;</hi> and abuſe your Reader: or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
contradict your ſelf, and overthrow your own grounds. But
<hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi> are <hi>maſters of families</hi> alſo, you ſay, and therefore
have a part, or bear a ſhare in your <hi>Tradition.</hi> I could anſwer, that <hi>flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mothers</hi> is the word in Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> reply all along, or moſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current,
not without ground, certainly: and in the very <hi>manner,</hi> or <hi>nature</hi>
of this <hi>Tradition,</hi> as it is explained; it is certain, they muſt be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part, incomparably. But if we take in <hi>Fathers,</hi> as well as <hi>Mothers,</hi>
(which I ſuppoſe is your intention:) then <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> may come
in, I will grant you; but then it muſt be, in the moſt literal ſenſe, as they
are fathers of children, as well as other men, though they have no wives.
For though he may be called <hi>Pater familias,</hi> I know, that keeps a houſe,
though of <hi>ſervants</hi> onely: yet <hi>ſervants, men</hi> and <hi>women</hi> at large, are not
for your purpoſe, as you explain the buſineſs of <hi>Tradition;</hi> but ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who were taught by their <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers,</hi> when <hi>Children:</hi> neither
are others mentioned by you, that I remember. Yea moſt of your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
fall to the ground; as natural affection, and the like; if others be
admitted, beſides <hi>Children.</hi> If therefore you take in <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi>
as partners, or actors in your <hi>tradition:</hi> it muſt needs be, you preſuppoſe,
they have <hi>Children,</hi> all, or moſt. Which though it may be true enough;
yet whether they will take it well, at your hands, to acknowledg it ſo
publickly, <hi>I</hi> know not. But all this granted; yet it is but little, that you
grant to <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Prelates.</hi> For you ſay, <hi>they are a part, and the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenteſt
members;</hi> that, is ſomewhat: but you add, (and indeed could
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101247:12"/>
not avoid it, by your grounds:) <hi>pag. 333. in proportion to their number</hi>
and what is that, among ſo many millions of other men?</p>
            <p>The fifth <hi>Injury:</hi> I charge your way, or Doctrine, with many <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
ſuppoſitions, and impertinencies.</hi> I have ſaid enough to this, which
I ſhall not need to repeat. I ſhall onely add; I underſtand by you, ſome
body is appointed to anſwer you. You know what Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath
done already, whom I think you never anſwered. But by your <hi>Sure foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
firſt and ſecond part, I perceive <hi>you,</hi> or rather indeed your <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> or
<hi>deluſion,</hi> hath made a great progreſs. If therefore it ſhould ſo fall out,
that you have been miſ-informed, and your dreams are not thought ſo
conſiderable as to deſerve an anſwer; pray for my life, and health, (for it
may do you good, and I look upon you ſtill, as an ingenuous man, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this hath happened to you;) and I will promiſe you, very <hi>mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically,</hi>
and <hi>ſcientifically,</hi> (as great an enemy as you take me to <hi>ſcience</hi>) to
examine all your grounds; and to make it appear clearly, to your ſelf, if
poſsible; but to all men that have but <hi>eyes and ears,</hi> (to uſe your own
expreſsion) that nothing can be more contrary to the courſe of <hi>Nature,</hi>
and to <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> grounded upon certain and approved <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>
of all <hi>Ages;</hi> than what you ground upon. What you may
think of it, I know not: but I do not conceive that there is any thing
of bragging in this undertaking: elſe, it would not become me, and I
ſhould be ſorry for it.</p>
            <p>In that which followeth, by <hi>Ours</hi> and <hi>Yours;</hi> I know not what you
mean, whether <hi>Poepiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in general; or whether you,
and me particularly: but I think, and it is more probable, <hi>Papiſts</hi>
and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in general. However, it is apparent, you do brag
and vapour egregiouſly, as if you intended to put your adverſaries out
of countenance, by calling them <hi>cowardly rogues;</hi> and by telling them,
what brave things you have done; when in very deed, it is but a
dream, and pure imagination. Put this is, as all the reſt, <hi>Tradition
on its Throne:</hi> and, <hi>the gates of Hell, &amp;c.</hi> it is no good ſign.</p>
            <p>But I have ſaid, (or indeed <hi>ſuſpected,</hi> I ſay no more; but I will
not ſtand upon that) you are <hi>no friend to ancient books, or learning:</hi>
Truly, Sir, I think a man may gather ſo much by your own words
and profeſſion. What mean you elſe, when you ſo often tell us of,
<hi>wordiſh learning; aicry deſcants and diſcourſes; knacks of humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Grammar and Criticiſms; bookiſhneſs, and much reading;</hi> and
the like: But if it be granted, all this may come from a man that is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101247:13"/>
a <hi>lover</hi> of true <hi>learning,</hi> but <hi>impatient</hi> to ſee how much it is <hi>wronged</hi>
by many <hi>falſe pretenders;</hi> (which is true enough:) yet if <hi>Fathers and
Mothers of Families,</hi> who, I think, generally, do not pretend to
much learning, are able and <hi>ſufffcient,</hi> nay the onely <hi>ſure means</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God, to <hi>preſerve truth,</hi> in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi>
what further uſe have we of all <hi>books,</hi> ancient and late, that have been
written on that ſubject? You know, Sir, that ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> and
<hi>Councils,</hi> and other <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Writers,</hi> their <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> and
what hath been written upon them, by ſundry learned men, will
make a great part of that, which we (Divines, at leaſt) call <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
that ſuch Books, in greateſt Libraries, take up moſt part of the
room. It is not enough to ſay, a man may read them, for his <hi>recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
if he will, and we are not bound to <hi>burn</hi> them: You need to
ſay no more, but that there is <hi>no need of them:</hi> what will follow,
ſhould you be believed, generally, by men in Authority; any man may
foreſee, without the gift of Propheſie: in this age eſpecially, ſo much
addicted to <hi>new knacks,</hi> and <hi>inventions;</hi> ſo fiercely ſet, to diſgrace and
cry down whatſoever former ages have moſt eſteemed, and reverenced.</p>
            <p>Your diviſion of Books into ſeveral <hi>Claſſes,</hi> and <hi>ſentiment</hi> of them
ſo divided, I have no mind to quarrel at, or examine, becauſe it is
not much to the purpoſe, or main buſineſs. That many <hi>deſerve</hi> no
better then to be <hi>burned,</hi> even of them that fill <hi>Catalogues</hi> and <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
I ſhould eaſily yield: ſo it were done by them that could <hi>judge</hi>
of Books indeed, not <hi>by ſelf-conceited men,</hi> or by men addicted to one
kind of ſtudy, who are apt to think all needleſs, that comes not within
the verge of their cogniſance, or capacity. But I do not like your
counſel of <hi>abridging:</hi> for that hath been the deſtruction of beſt Authors,
in all Ages, and hath brought many a curſe upon the <hi>Abbreviators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among them that deſerve to be burned, it would not much trouble
me, if Dr. <hi>Dee's tedious Legend about his Spirits,</hi> were one. And becauſe
you tell me of him, I am very willing to take this occaſion to acquaint
others, (in caſe this paper be ever printed) how I came to have to do
with him. I know, I have ſaid enough elſewhere; but becauſe many
have heard of the Book, by relation, who never ſaw it; and becauſe
ſomewhat is come to my knowledge, ſince, which I did not know then;
I hope it will not do amiſs here.</p>
            <p>When I lived at Sir <hi>John Cottons,</hi> (where, beſides the comfort and
honour of that truly noble and learned Gentlemans company, I had the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101247:13"/>
uſe of a <hi>choiſe Library,</hi> as any <hi>England,</hi> for the number, doth afford) in his
Father, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> (then living) his houſe, at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> I had not been
there many months, but Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> did mention theſe papers of Dr. <hi>Dees</hi>
unto me; adding, that my Lord of <hi>Armagh</hi> had ſeen them, and wiſhed
them printed; not for their <hi>worth</hi> or <hi>exellency;</hi> but becauſe he found in
them ſo much of the humor and language of the <hi>times,</hi> as that he thought
many would be <hi>convinced</hi> by the book, from whence, either, (<hi>Canting
language,</hi> and <hi>affected Sanctitie</hi>) did ſpring. When I had peruſed them,
my anſwer was, I was very fully ſatisfied of the reality of thoſe things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
the book related: that I knew Dr. <hi>Dees</hi> hand very well, (I did know it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I had divers books, which had been his; among others, a <hi>Simleri Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliotheca,</hi>
where Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> had written, in the margines, the names of divers
Manuſcript books, in <hi>England, Greek,</hi> and others, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he had ſeen in ſeveral
places: I know not how I came to part with it, as I did with many others,
for which I have been very ſorry ſince:) and was ſure it was his hand; and
made no queſtion, but the <hi>Devil,</hi> or <hi>deluding ſpirits,</hi> (whom he thought to
be good) had appeared to him, in that manner, as is there related. But for
the <hi>printing,</hi> I doubted ſcarce any man would adventure upon it, becauſe
it was ſuch mad uncouth ſtuffe, for the moſt part. So the buſineſs reſted,
halfe a year, more, or leſſe. After that, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ſpake to me a ſecond
time, and ſeemed very deſirous that the Book were printed. I told him I
would look upon it again, and if I found, as I had done before, I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
a <hi>Preface</hi> upon it; and then we would try, what could be done. This
was done, and the book (ſo it fell out) printed. What I have ſaid of it, in
the <hi>Preface,</hi> for which I have had thanks from many, who were not much
pleaſed with the Book; I retract not. If the Book hath not given content
unto all men, I have no great reaſon to wonder at it. Onely this, by your
good leave, I ſhall add, to confirm the reality of the relations, that are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Many other papers of Dr. <hi>Dees,</hi> ſince that Book was printed, came to
my hands; containing more <hi>Viſions</hi> and <hi>Revelations;</hi> with many <hi>Letters</hi>
from great Princes, and particular tranſactions; by all which (for the hands
and ſeals, with many other circumſtances, will ſatisfie any rational man of
the ſincerity of the Records) it doth further appear, in what <hi>credit</hi> he was
then, in the World; what <hi>uſe</hi> he made of his <hi>Spirits;</hi> or rather, they of him;
and that ſome <hi>great matter</hi> was attempted by the <hi>Devil</hi> in him, &amp; by him,
but that God diſappointed it. Among thoſe papers, there is a particular
relation of a Conference they had, (Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> and his mate <hi>Kelly:</hi>) with a
great <hi>Prelate,</hi> (Biſhop, or Archbiſhop, I do not well remember:) in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:101247:14"/>
but not a <hi>German;</hi> in the concluſion whereof, becauſe the Biſhop would
not yield theſe Apparitions were true, (that is, from <hi>God,</hi> and by <hi>good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>)
<hi>Kelly</hi> in a great rage challenged him to go down with him to the
open fields; He ſhould pray, and he would pray; and they ſhould know,
which of them God did own for his, and which not. Which the Biſhop
refuſed, but gave him very good <hi>Reaſons,</hi> (ſuch as became a ſober grave
Chriſtian, and Prelate:) why he would not. That relation, I think, is
in <hi>Latin.</hi> I conclude; What you ſay in ſcorn of that Book, doth not
concern me. If you have any thing to ſay to the <hi>Preface,</hi> I will anſwer
you. Theſe late Papers I have mentioned, if you deſire to know, are
to be found (with the permiſſion of the worthy, and honourable Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
there, from whence the others, now printed, came.</p>
            <p>And now to return to you, Sir; it doth offend you, that I ſaid <hi>Atheiſm</hi>
and <hi>Mahometiſm</hi> would get well, by <hi>your way,</hi> How can it be otherwiſe,
when all <hi>faith,</hi> all <hi>chriſtianity,</hi> practical, and other, neceſſary to ſalvation,
is reduced to ſuch <hi>Authority?</hi> You have already been told, that you juſtify
<hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſm:</hi> it is the way that the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> anciently took,
to uphold their cauſe; and the <hi>Mahometans</hi> may, when they pleaſe: now,
they need it not. Neither, may you be ſure, will ever be converted by your
principles. And for <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> in very deed, I cannot phanſie them, (I
will except you; <hi>I</hi> conceive yours is a different caſe:) much better then
<hi>Atheiſts,</hi> that build their faith upon ſuch a ridiculous (good ſport to
<hi>Atheiſts,</hi> or atheiſticall men:) ſenſeleſs foudation.</p>
            <p>The ſixth, and laſt <hi>injury,</hi> which, you ſay, you account the worſt; That
I ſhould write, <hi>Others of approved worth and abilities, had met with you, who
I thought had done you more credit, then you deſerved.</hi> I am ſorry I ſhould
expreſs my ſelf, which I avoid as much as <hi>I</hi> can, ſo obſcurely, you ſhould
be ſo much miſtaken in my meaning. But when you know my meaning,
whether you will like it better, I know not. However, I will tell you: My
meaning was, that Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> a man of approved worth and ability,
had already anſwered you: who I thought, had done you, (your <hi>book,</hi> not
your <hi>perſon;</hi>) more honour, by ſo long and elaborate an <hi>anſwer;</hi> (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>I</hi> did wonder at) then you had deſerved, by that book of yours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> have done with all that concerneth me. Nothing now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth,
but that, as obliged, if by nothing elſe, yet by your example I
ſubſcribe my ſelf, Sir,</p>
