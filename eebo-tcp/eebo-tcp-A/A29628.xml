            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS plain diſcourſe having mett with great encouragement by your ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, and favourable approbation of it, doth now preſume to ſhelter it ſelf under your Wing, as not knowing any better <hi>Aſylum</hi> to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to then your protection, whoſe exemplary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Loyalty, as they have endured im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably the greateſt ſhocks of Fanatick rage and malice, ſo are they chiefly able to ſuccour ſuch Perſons, who are likely to fall under the ſame diſmal fate, and to ſuffer perſecution from the malevolent Tongues of thoſe Foul-mouth'd Animals, who were never acquainted with any other civility but that of railing.</p>
            <p>How farr this diſcourſe may provoke the cholor of ſome Men, I ſhall not much concern my ſelf; being reſolved to follow the advice of the wiſe <hi>Philoſopher, Not to kick againſt ſuch Aſſes whoſe chief Talent hath</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105490:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>been found to lye moſtly in their Heels, and have for a long while ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a Delirium in their upper parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if ſome of their own party ſpeaks true, (and 'tis hard not to believe but that ſometime they may doe it,) that what was here utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was delivered with ſo great modeſty and little Paſſion, that it muſt needs be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by all unprejudiced Men, they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged rather to give me thanks, then to pick a quarrell with me for endeavouring to undelude them.</p>
            <p>And that this was chiefly the deſign will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear throughout the whole ſeries of it, which is to make Men truely ſenſible of all Seditious Principles and Practiſes, and to ſhew them what an Hainous crime it is to Act a <hi>Ravillac's</hi> part under a <hi>True Proteſtant</hi> diſguiſe, or to hide a Dominican Dagger under a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Cloak, that it was farr more adviſeable to expiate the guilt of a late Murdered Sovereign before they enter upon a new Tragaedy, and embrue their hands in the Blood of his ſurviving Sons; and that to ruine three Kingdoms twice in one age, is to
<pb facs="tcp:105490:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
render themſelves the moſt inſatiable ſort of <hi>Cannibals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine all that this diſcourſe would put them upon is to repent of what is paſt from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of their Hearts, and to promiſe to do better for the future without any mental reſervations, and by their Loyal Practiſes to evince the true ſincerity of their intentions: And ſurely this ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted no unfriendly Office by them to reminde them of ſuch things as are chiefly wanting in them, when 'tis a moſt excellent and ſeaſonable <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi> Authoriz'd by that great Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, put them in mind to be ſubject to principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers to obey Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>But Gentlemen, leaſt whilſt I am preaching <hi>Memento</hi>'s to others I forget my ſelf to you, give me leave to declare, that how plain ſoever the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was in Preaching, the Publication of this Sermon is chiefly owing to that abſolute power which your commands have with me, where it will be as impoſſible for me to reſiſt their force, as to denye thoſe manifold obligations ſo frequently devolved upon me: And if it meet with any frowns of the Fanatick Tribe it will be a ſufficient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
<pb facs="tcp:105490:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that it hath paſs'd the Pikes with you, whoſe candid and unbiaſs'd Judgment will be able to buoy it up againſt the blackeſt aſperſions: In a juſt deffiance to which I humbly lay it at your feet, with a due acknowledgment that I am</p>

                  <p>The wicked Plotteth againſt the juſt, and gnaſheth upon him with his teeth.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT hath been truely obſerved in the revolutions of the World, that thoſe Perſons who have been realy the moſt profeſs'd Enemies to all Religion, themſelves have been for ſupplanting its true Profeſſors, and for hindring its further growth and entertainment with other men; and this is little to be wondred at, that they who are only guided by the principles of Atheiſm ſhould puſh forward Irreligion; and endeavour to undermine all oppoſers of it: But for men who pretend to the height and purity of Religion, at the ſame time to ſtrike the greateſt blow againſt it by their practiſes, is ſuch a rank piece of Hypocriſy as never any but this age could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Parallel.</p>
            <p>Indeed 'tis too too common with the <hi>Pope</hi> and his cunning E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſariſs, to conſult the Intereſt of the <hi>Triple Diadem</hi> above the Crowns, and make the Laws of Religion no further uſefull and obliging then they are ſubſervient to the deſigns and Policies of his State-Engineers; 'tis no news to hear him quarrelling with the greateſt Emperours and Princes, and thundring out his ſevereſt Bulls and Anathema's againſt them, if they will not tamely ſubmit to his Uſurpations and Encroachments: To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Kings, and abſolve Subjects from their Allegiance, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Sedition, and cauſe Inſurrections, to ſet Kingdoms in Flames, and draw People into Arms; this is a meritorious piece of ſervice amongſt Jeſuites.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:105490:5"/>
But then for <hi>True Proteſtants</hi> to quarrel at the <hi>Pope</hi> for his Bloodineſs and cruelty, and yet write after his Copy in the ſame Charactars of Blood, to afright People out of their ſenſes with the hideous noiſe and amuſement of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Maſſacres and Conflagrations, and yet at the ſame time privately to ferment the Nation into Rebellion, and to prepare <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes to doe the ſame bloody Execution with <hi>Popiſh</hi> Knives and Daggers; I ſay, to make a mighty ſplutter and huge outcry againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and yet at the ſame time to take the very ſame <hi>Popiſh</hi> meaſures of Ruine and Deſtruction: This is a new way of ſupplanting and beating down <hi>Popery,</hi> which was never known in the World, till the <hi>Saints</hi> of the laſt Edition Chalk'd out the ready way for it, and prov'd by ſuch practiſes as theſe, That their only means to become the beſt Chriſtians was firſt to commence the moſt flagitious and bloody Villians.</p>
            <p>And that this was not true either in <hi>Theory</hi> or <hi>Practiſe,</hi> it were well for them that have of late been Styled publickly, not only the briskeſt and tighteſt part of the Nations Friends, but even the very <hi>Anti-Papal</hi> Guardians and Saviours of it: but (alaſs) theſe are the Demure and Sober party amongſt us, who have ſow'd together the Fig-Leaves of <hi>Sanctimonious</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to cover the moſt Horrid and Execrable Impietys, and under Holy <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Prophetick Mantle have fobb'd of all their Satanical deluſions amongſt the Multitude.</p>
            <p>Theſe are they, who under a deſign of deſtroying all thoſe whom they are pleaſed to call <hi>Baals Prieſts,</hi> have approved themſelves zealous for thoſe of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and by the moſt poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Libells that were ever hatch'd by a brood of <hi>Sanguinary Conſpirators,</hi> have been promoting the true intereſt and wellfair of the Nation: Theſe are the men who with lift up Eyes and ſanctified Lips; call God a Thouſand times to witneſs the Integrity of their Hearts, and the Loyalty of their Intentions, whilſt upon pain and perill of another <hi>Meroz-Courſe,</hi> they were ſecretly calling out the People to the help of the Lord; to the help of the Lord againſt the Mighty: Nay, whilſt they were ſolemnly proteſting with the moſt bitter Aſceverations, both
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105490:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in their <hi>Pamphlets</hi> and Diſcourſes againſt all <hi>Proteſtant-Plotts,</hi> and <hi>Aſſociations</hi> againſt the <hi>Government,</hi> they were even at that time more eager and hott upon the Sent of it.</p>
            <p>Thus whilſt they were wheadling us into a good Opinion of their Actions, they were then at work with the moſt Helliſh Contrivances, and the <hi>Saints</hi> in the <hi>Conventicle</hi> prou'd Devils in the <hi>Caball.</hi> For King and People were there appointed as <hi>Sheep for the Slaughter,</hi> and <hi>Church and State</hi> both deſign'd a Sacrifice to their Cruelty and Revenge: And what Malice ſo implacable, what Rage ſo inexorable as <hi>Fanatick Rage? Nunc Cinna pius Cinna &amp; Sylla, Marius</hi> and <hi>Catiline</hi> were men of Mercy to theſe, Maugre all their Republican Principles and Maſſacres at <hi>Rome;</hi> and even <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> had theſe mens villanys ſucceeded, would have abhorr'd their very memories as the prodigies of Humane Nature, and a ſhame to all Mankind.</p>
            <p>But God who ſets bounds to the Tempeſtuous Waves of the Sea, and ſaith,<hi> Hither ſhall ye go and no further, </hi>hath put a Hook into the Noſtrils of our<hi> Republican Leviathan's, </hi>and hath as yet ſtopp'd them in their Career by diſcovering their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy;<hi> and though the Wicked plotteth againſt the Juſt, and gnaſheth upon him with his Teeth, </hi>yet God,<hi> who ſitteth in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, ſhall Laugh him to Scorn, for he ſeeth that his day is Coming.</hi>

               </gap> which we tranſlate plotteth is more ſignificantly rendred by the Latins, <hi>Contra jus &amp; fas ſuperſtitioſe obſervat,</hi> which implies an illegal and unlawful, or any overcurious and even ſuperſtitious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and taking notice of, and miſconſtruing the Actions of another to his detriment and prejudice, a prying ſo far into them as to be able to Obviate and Countermine them, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from purſuing thoſe ends to which they were direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So that the malicious deſign of the wicked againſt the juſt, which <hi>David</hi> ſeems to decipher, is this, <hi>That he is ſtill making it his buſineſs privately to do the Righteous Man the greateſt miſchief, by miſrepreſenting his Actions to the Publick, by taking ſuch malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>

            <p>And hence ariſe evil thoughts, and falſe ſurmizes, and wrangling debates, and perverſe diſputings by men of corrupt minds, who turn <hi>Faith</hi> into <hi>Faction,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> into <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and all <hi>Government</hi> muſt bee <hi>Aboliſh'd</hi> that is not of their Mold and all Humane Appointments <hi>Abrogated</hi> that are not ſtamp'd with their Mark; and if <hi>Governours</hi> will not be huff'd out of their Authority by their demands, then all their Actions muſt be immediately miſrepreſented to the Croud, and the People muſt be forthwith harangu'd into mutiny and ſedition, and <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> muſt be the laſt refuge of the <hi>Saints</hi> to ſet up <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Kingdom</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Caeſars.</hi>

            <p>That theſe have been the proceedings for ſome years in this Kingdom, I think none ſo great a Recluſe to be ignorant of at this day; for who ever more perſecuted by ſeditious Boute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feus then our moſt Gracious King? What ever more haraſt'd by Factious Spirits then our Apoſtolical Church? Was not our Sovereigns Reſtauration very wonderfull and Miraculous, and hath not God atteſted his care and protection over him ever ſince that time by ſuch a ſeries of Deliverances, as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his Enemies (one would think) that he is above the reach of their malice, and the very darling and favourite of Heaven it ſelf? And yet for all this, have they not taken all advantages to ſtuff the Pillow of his Crown with Thorns, and to make the Throne totter, and become uneaſie to his Majeſty? Did not an ungratefull <hi>Abſalom</hi> endeavour to ſteal away the Hearts of his People from him, whilſt a falſe and trecharous <hi>Achitophel</hi> did form and marſhall them into Clubbs and partys againſt him? Did not the railing <hi>Shimeis</hi> and bawling <hi>Rabſhakah's</hi> of the party endeavour to blaſt his reputation with his Subjects, whilſt the canting <hi>Sheba's</hi> by blowing the Trumpet of ſedition did <hi>Alarum</hi> them all into another Holy Warr? And whilſt they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring up ſuch Hurricanes againſt the King, was not the Church to be involv'd in the ſame general calamity, and both his and the Churches Friends doom'd to the ſame portion of ſufferings,

under which for ſo many years together they had once ſo found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmarted?</p>
            <p>Alaſs, theſe tender-hearted and purely conſcientious Perſons, could by no means away with the harmleſs Rites of the Church, but were preparing their <hi>Swallows</hi> again for its goods and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and though one poor ſmall Ceremony might by no means go down for fear of choaking them, yet a <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have been a very pleaſant morſell for a break-faſt, for Church-lands never yet came within their motion of Sacrilege; and though decimating and ſequeſting and plundring was out of faſhion, it had been a Trade which prov'd formerly ſo benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the <hi>Saints,</hi> that they began to grow bigg with hope of renewing the <hi>Monopoly.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And ſo from the <hi>Plott</hi> it ſelf, I ſhall proceed to the ſecond thing, and conſider the grounds and Original of this and all other Plotts and Conſpiracies in the World; which I ſhall reſolve into three general Cauſes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And firſt they are occaſioned by ſpreading dangerous Poſitions and Seditious Principles amongſt the Multitude: For when the People are taught that they are the <hi>Supream Power,</hi> and all civil
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105490:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Authority is derived originally from them, that there is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual compact between a Prince and his Subjects, and that if he perform not his Duty they are diſchar ged from theirs; why, 'tis only giving out that the Prince hath forfeited his Truſt, and is accountable for the breach of that power with which he was Entruſted; and then the next thing by courſe follows to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or Murder him, and he falls juſtly too by the Sword for thoſe, which they call, his Crimes and Miſdemeanours.</p>
            <p>Again, what greater Encouragement can poſſibly be given to conſpire againſt a <hi>Government,</hi> and contrive its utter Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then when men are told publickly that ſelf preſervation is ſuch a fundamental Law of Nature as ſuperſeeds the Obligation of all others which ſtand in competition with it, and that it is Lawfull for their own defence, and the defence of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to enter into what Leagues, Covenants, or Aſſociations they pleaſe, even againſt the will and conſent of the <hi>Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate?</hi> And can there be any higher incentive to <hi>Rebellion</hi> in the world, then to Preach amongſt the Rabble, that the Doctrine of the Goſpel concerning patient ſuffering of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is not incompatible with taking up <hi>Arms</hi> againſt our <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and that Reſiſtance of <hi>Superiours</hi> is a thing very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, where our <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> are invaded by them?</p>
            <p>Nay once more, when <hi>Rebellion</hi> grows proſperous, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies</hi> are Crown'd with ſucceſs, when <hi>Victory</hi> flyes to the ſides of Oppreſſours, and Kings are led in triumph for a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to the Multitude, tell the People but then, as it was taught them in the late Warrs, that Poſſeſſion and Strength give a right to Govern, and ſucceſs in a cauſe or enterprize proclaim it to be lawfull and juſt, and to purſue it is to comply with the will of God, becauſe it is to follow the conduct of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and I defye any better method to inſtigate them afreſh then this will prove, for it puſheth them forward upon new attempts, and it makes them ſo daring and deſperate in that Cauſe, which they believe God himſelf hath own'd ſo provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially, that they will Caball and Plott, and Mutiny and Fight againſt all who ſhall oppoſe them in their Reſolves and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105490:8"/>
Deſigns, being ſtill fluſh'd with hopes of a glorious ſucceſs; and tha t God will never deſert that People or that cauſe, for which once he did ſo ſignally interpoſe his mighty Providence.</p>
            <p>Thus where men have once ſuck'd in ſuch dangerous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as theſe, they ſcruple not to act according to thoſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and they muſt needs prove very pernitious in order to the undermining the Peace and proſperity of that State where they are entertain'd, becauſe they are the very bane of all Obedience and Loyalty, and transform men into ſuch horrid monſters of <hi>Anarchy</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> as are unfit to live in any <hi>Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,</hi> being like the <hi>Plague</hi> that poiſons all places with their infectious Contagion; as wee have felt by too woefull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in theſe three flouriſhing Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, nothing doth more occaſion miſchieveous Plotts and Conſpiracies then needleſs fears and jealouſies about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Government: till but the People in plauſible cant, that the King is ſetting up for Tyranny and Arbitrary Government, and that he is reſolved to Sacrifice all their lives and liberties to his unbounded ambition and avarice; though above twenty years experience doth fully atteſt the contrary (a Reign where Law and Juſtice were never ſtretch'd unleſs to mercy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; a Reign where too eaſie forgiveneſs, and receiving his pardon'd Enemies the warm ungratefull ſnakes too near into the boſom of Majeſty, and too high into his truſt and honours has been the only fault in his Throne) yet this imaginary <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan</hi> of arbitrary power ſhall raiſe ſuch panick fears, that thoſe very ſhadows and <hi>Chimaera's</hi> like ſo many <hi>Igens fatui</hi> ſhall miſlead deluded ignorance into diſtraction and rebellion, whilſt the great Knaves trail the Carrion, and the little Fools hunt after, as one Phraſeth it wittily to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Again let it be but given out though with all the incoheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cys and abſurditys imaginable that the <hi>Pope</hi> is advancing with his Holy Banners into this Kingdom, and is reſolv'd to make a reprizal of all his loſt ground amongſt us; tell them that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> are <hi>Penſioners</hi> to his <hi>Holyneſs,</hi> and are reſolv'd to open both their Churches and Treaſuries to readmit his <hi>Sacred Train;</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:105490:8"/>
'tis not all theſe mens Proteſtations, or Teſts, diſcourſes, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Sermons can be able to undiſguiſe the deluded rabble, or gain them any reverence from theſe their profeſſ'd Enemies; but they muſt be hollowed out of the World with the common crye of the multitude, <hi>Away with theſe fellows it is not fit that they ſhould live:</hi> thus Chriſt muſt ſuffer by the decree of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> leaſt <hi>Heathen Rome</hi> prevail, and the <hi>Romans</hi> come and take away both their place and Nation, though the very death of Chriſt brought in the <hi>Romans</hi> to deſtroy them; and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> muſt be voted down by our <hi>Phariſaical Diſſenters,</hi> leaſt that proving an inlet to <hi>Popery</hi> the modern <hi>Romaniſts</hi> by that means take an occaſion to root them out; when indeed the caſe is plain, that if ever they ſhould again prevail to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of our Eſtabliſh'd Church, <hi>Rome</hi> would pay them quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the very ſame coine, and they but haſten their own Ruine, by the contrivance of ours.</p>
            <p>Let not then any fooliſh fears or jealouſys, that are conjured up, affright us out of our Loyalty and Obedience to our <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi> for thoſe are only the <hi>State-Tools</hi> of <hi>Hot-ſpurd Bigots</hi> and <hi>Incendiars,</hi> and are always uſed as Boys doe Vizors to fright every body but themſelves that wear them: And though there is not the leaſt ſhadow or appearance for ſuch ſurmizes, and all is rank <hi>Forgery</hi> which they ſcatter amongſt the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; yet becauſe they know the Temper of moſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, that they fear nothing which they ſee, but all things that they hear, which if unpleaſing, and ungrateful doe preſently ſet them a kicking and madding againſt the <hi>Government;</hi> they grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their fooliſh humours in this affair, and after they have muſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered up a whole legion of publick Grievances in the Nation, they magnifie theſe very Annuſances with ſuch artifices of Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the People are induced to believe theſe imaginary Caſtles and Scare-Crows to be real and ſubſtantial Truths, and ſo run into confuſion and an oppoſition of that <hi>Government,</hi> which were it not for theſe men they would quietly acquieſce in, and think it the greateſt happineſs to live quietly under, withall Obedience and Submiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:105490:9"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But a third thing which makes men aſſociate in <hi>Leagnes,</hi> and <hi>Plotts,</hi> and <hi>Conſpiracys,</hi> is an uneaſineſs under <hi>Government,</hi> and an itching deſire after new changes and Alterations: Though after all the mighty heats and debates amongſt <hi>Politicians Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies</hi> have at laſt been Voted for the beſt of <hi>Governments,</hi> and one <hi>Tyrant</hi> (if ſo it happen) more tolerable then thirty at <hi>Athens,</hi> or a greater number in <hi>England;</hi> Yet ſo beſotted are ſome <hi>Bigors</hi> to Common-wealth principles and practiſes that a <hi>Solomon</hi> upon the Throne ſhall be made impeaceable at their tribunal, and they who perhaps <hi>Alphonſus</hi> like could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd the World better, had they been admitted Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors with God Almighty at the Creation, no doubt are ſo opinionative as throughly to be perſwaded that they can Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the World better too then Gods Vice-gerents who are at the Helm, might their meaſures be taken in the adminiſtration of Government.</p>
            <p>But what are the meaſures which theſe men of Policy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? Why, if the Prerogative was but little more paired, and <hi>Church-government</hi> new modell'd, and ſquar'd more exactly to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> cut, you ſhould perhaps have theſe Mens witts leave off working for a while, till the next Moon cauſ'd a new Fermentation in the Brain; and when their <hi>Lunacy</hi> did return, new projects muſt be ſet on Foot, and down goes <hi>Presbytery</hi> as too ſevere and Tyrannical, and a <hi>Jus divinum</hi> muſt be enſtamp'd with a <hi>Nemine Contradicent</hi> upon Independency; till at length the Moon changeth again, and then it being thought too much to <hi>Monopolize</hi> true Chriſtianity to any one particular ſect of Men, at laſt comes out a Toleration, and like <hi>Noahs Ark</hi> takes in all clean and unclean Creatures within the Pale of the Church, till our Hereſies grow as numerous as the very Letters of our <hi>Creeds,</hi> and the Church it ſelf become realy, what <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> once falſly traduced it to be, a Sanctuary for all the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Villanies, and moſt horrid Diabolical illuſions in the World.</p>
            <p>And theſe are the true Fruits and miſchiefs of unneceſſary changes in Government, which ſhould make us utterly deteſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105490:9"/>
all Abettours of them, and to dread the very thoughts of any further Reformation, until they could all agree upon a better then is eſtabliſh'd: For 'tis the duty of Reformers to provide themſelves of a ſure remedy before they take notice of the wound, and that Chyrurgeon deſerves to be puniſh'd who firſt opens the ſick Mans Vein and then runs for things to cloſe it: And they that would bleed the Kingdom in the <hi>Baſilick</hi> Vein, (as in their own Phraſe to their eternal infamy hath been once done allready,) and would heal the diſtempers of the Nation without having better remedies at hand, which are more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and expedient then at preſent are applied, is ſuch an impracticable way to cure it, as none but State-Quacks, and Bloody Empiricks would pretend to, and are therefore to be puniſhed as ſuch unskillful miſcreants whoſe proper work is not to cure but to ruine that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And now having Briefly acquainted you how farr the malice of wicked Men prompts them forward to commit the greateſt outrages by their curſed Plotts and Conſpiracies; and what is the ſource of all ſuch Deviliſh Machinations; it will be requiſite in the third place to deduce from thence ſuch practical conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as may be ſufficient to deterr men from ſuch vile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous practiſes againſt either Church or State.</p>
            <p>In order to which I deſire it may be conſidered,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that nothing is more deteſtable in the ſight of God,  then ſuch evil projects and treacherous deſignments againſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours: All obedience to Man is for the ſake of God, and they who by any contumelious Act vilifie their Superiours, reproach God himſelf who gave them their Authority: <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 15.</note>
               <hi>If by God Kings Reign, and Princes do decree Juſtice,</hi> to wound their Perſons is to ſtabb God in Effigy, nor can their Honour be Eclipſ'd without leſſening Gods too: He that quarrels with his Prince quarrels with God who hath beſtow'd upon him all his Regalia of Kingly power, and he that endeavours to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine or betray his Sovereign out of any ſelfiſh principle, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſt and deſign, was our Bleſſed Saviour now upon Earth, would <hi>Judas</hi> like venture his Soul to betray him too,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105490:10"/>
was he but ſure to come to a good Market for him.</p>
            <p>Hence the <hi>Gyants</hi> of old who warr'd againſt <hi>Jupieter</hi> are a very true Emblem of all Seditions Rebels; for to raiſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt Kings is to wage Warr with Heaven, whoſe Vice-Gerents they are, and what greater affront can be given? what more open violance offered to the King of Kings? To be ſtill carping and repining at all Publick adminiſtration of affairs is to queſtion Gods wiſdom in the choyce of his own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and in plain Terms to tell him, that he is much to blame in beſtowing Crowns upon Fools or wicked men: But methinks what <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid concerning <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> who was more diſquieted in his thoughts then he needed to have been concerning the confuſed ſtate of things in his days, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendus est</hi> Philippus <hi>deſinut eſſe Rector Mundi,</hi> is very applicable to our purpoſe at this preſent time: Every hot-brain'd Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick is duly to be admoniſhed that he would ceaſe to take upon him the Government of the World, as if he knew how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it to a better Lieutenancy then the Almighty; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that the Brethren would once be perſwaded to leave all their Mutinuſs and Seditious Practiſes, their raillery, and detraction, their Plotts and Aſſociations againſt Kings and all that are in Authority, becauſe God looks upon it as a contempt and a defiance given to himſelf, and therefore doth aſſure them, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</note>
               <hi>that as Rebellion is as the ſin of Witch-craft. So they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again God is pleaſed to declare his utter diſtaſt and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all ſuch practiſes by the Providential diſcoveries he ſo frequently makes of the greateſt conſpiracies in the World: And indeed there is no greater argument for the Providence of God againſt the rankeſt Atheiſts living, that he doth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take cognizance of all affairs of Sublunary beings; nor is there any ſurer Teſtimony of Gods mercy and loving-kindneſs to the Sons of Men, then the great care he hath taken for the preſervation of his People, and the wonderfull deliverances which in all ages of the World he hath wrought for the Church, maugre all the powerfull and Politick attempts of Men or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105490:10"/>
to undermine and deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>And if upon this account God owns any cauſe by making it ſucceſsful, which I ſhew'd you before it was the Doctrine of Fanaticks, what may they judge of our cauſe now, by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and happineſs of the late diſcovery? For if this argument be true, the Gates and Turrets of the City, who now groan under the Heads and Quarters of the late Executed Rebells, will Proclaim to all the World the gratious Succeſs on our ſide, and that God hath viſibly eſpouſ'd our Cauſe againſt thoſe Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall and Anti-Epiſcopall Zealots who did oppoſe it?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2,"/> Secondly, nothing is more inconſiſtent with the deſign of  true Religion, and the doctrine of Chriſtianity then ſuch vile Plotts and Conſpiracies, which make reſiſtance againſt Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours a thing Lawful; and conſequently that can be no true Church were ſuch Practiſes are allow'd of or countenanc'd by the chiefeſt members: Now that theſe things have been ever juſtified by the <hi>Fanatick Fraternity</hi> is as demonſtrable as to ſhew you where they have been look'd upon as Antichriſtian, and I defye any one to point me out the time where ever they were yet publickly diſown'd by a joynt concurrence of all their Sanctified Tribes.</p>
            <p>Read over, if you can think it worth your while to puddle in ſo much filth and impiety, ſome of the Books or Sermons of <hi>Calamy</hi> or <hi>Baxter, Owen</hi> or <hi>Goodwyn, Jenkyns</hi> or <hi>Marſhal,</hi> and of diverſe others who were the Heads and the very Oracles of both the Sectarian parties, and you will find the greateſt Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies countenanc'd, the horrid'ſt Blaſphemies vented, the deepeſt Treaſons encouraged, and the moſt execrable mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the late King himſelf juſtified in their Pulpitts and Preſſes, which have been the accurſed Fountains of all our deplorable calamities: Or if you pleaſe to take an infallible Antidote againſt them all, read over the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſayings, publiſh'd on this very account by the true Heroick <hi>Atlas</hi> of our eſtabliſh'd Church, and you will meet there with ſuch a Farrago of wicked principles and opinions flowing all immediately from the ſame ſink of Fanaticiſm, as indeed is no where elſe to be

They tell the people on the one hand that it is the will of God to have Kings put to death, Altars profan'd, Temples demoliſh'd; whilſt they treat the dreadfull Majeſty of Heaven on the other hand as if he himſelf was to come in for a ſhare in the next Crown or Church-lands that fell: They bleſs God for ſucceſſes, and pray for bleſſings that carry damnation along with them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the motions of Hell to the very breathings of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe things were not done privately in a Corner, or ſhrouded up cloſely in the ſhades of darkneſs, but were publiſh'd boldly and openly in the face of the Sun, as doctrines fit to be propagated and eſpouſed by all true Chriſtians; nor were theſe the particular ſentiments only of ſome private men, but the approv'd opinions of all their principal Teachers, ſome of which were Aſſembly-men, urged with all the Zeal, and inculcated to their People with all the vigour imaginable, and ſome of theſe Perſons are alive at this very day, and we find them Men of the ſame Kidneys ſtill, for they have not yet retracted any of theſe Seditious principles, nor recanted for their dangerous opinions and tenents, nor given the State any reaſonable ſatisfaction to believe that they are ſorry for what they have done, nor declared any viſible reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or regret for all their former miſdemeanours, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in a Fanatick being as great a Miracle as converſion in a <hi>Jew.</hi>

            <p>Now 'tis impoſſible that Men who are poiſon'd with ſuch Unchriſtian ſentiments as theſe can ever be Members of a Church truly Chriſtian: And I never read of any Rebells that were Canoniz'd for Saints by thoſe who did believe themſelves to be the beſt and <hi>Trueſt Proteſtants,</hi> till Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> firſt placed them in his <hi>Saints Everlaſting Reſt;</hi> for Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity

truely primitive, never own'd any ſuch principles or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the World, but lays down other Maxims of another ſtamp and nature; it commands us Love and Peace, Unity and Obedience, and abhorrs all Schiſms and Factions and Diſſenſions as Plagues and Fire-brands; it obligeth us to be ſubject to the higher powers and to obey for conſcience ſake, and to ſubmit our ſelves to froward and cruel as well as to mild and Gentle Governours; it allows us not, though ſurrounded with Storms of perſecution, to take our meaſures of obedience from our ſtrength or our numbers, for the primitive Chriſtians were more in number and greater in power then their Perſecutors, and yet <hi>nunquam conjuratio erupit,</hi> faith the Father, there never was any uprour or hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-burly amongſt them, but in reverence to their Maſter and his example, <hi>Interimi ſe a paucioribus quam interimere patie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur,</hi> they rather ſuffered themſelves to be kill'd by a ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler number then themſelves are: And St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> cryes out, <hi>Nemo noſtrum quando apprehenditur reluctatur, quamvis nimius &amp; copioſus noſter populus;</hi> none of us when we are apprehended ſtrive or endeavour to revenge your unjuſt violence, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our People are very many and more numerous then you are; and <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives the reaſon, <hi>Occidi licet occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere non licet;</hi> God hath made it Lawfull for us to ſuffer our ſelves to be kill'd, but not Lawfull for us to kill.</p>
            <p>And indeed the doctrine of Reſiſtance was never taught in the Chriſtian School, till the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Jeſuites</hi> layd down plainly the Text, and our <hi>True Proteſtant Scotch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> new upſtart <hi>Theologico-politici</hi> began to lick up the Venom, and were pleaſ'd to raiſe their Holy comments upon it; and it was quite beaten out of countenance, till of late an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate <hi>Julian,</hi> allmoſt as bad as <hi>Julian</hi> whoſe life he writes, did endeavour again to bring it into reputation with the Mobile: Sure I am that the whole life of our Saviour was a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſuch vile Practiſes, his rebuking St. <hi>Peter</hi> for raſhly <note place="margin">St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 52.</note>uſing the Sword, was a plain diſcountenancing ſuch unevangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal principles, the ſufferings of all the Apoſtles and primitive

No hereſy is more pernitious then this doctrine of Reſiſtance, the whole Stream of Apoſtolical Men running quite counter to it, both in their principles and practiſes.</p>
            <p>So that till men learn to be more peaceable and quiet, more ſubmiſſive and obedient, leſs mutinous and refractory, leſs cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious and ſeditious, till they leave off pleading conſcience, for not doing that which a Goſpel-conſcience tells them they are obliged to do, and never take up Arms, raiſe any inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, or confederate in any private leagues or aſſociations againſt their Governours; let them liſt themſelves in what Congregations, and Church themſelves in what Aſſemblies, and pretend to what meaſures of Saintſhipp they pleaſe, I darr aſſure them (if the Goſpel be true) that they are not yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll'd in the Catalogue of Gods true Saints, who never as yet held up one hand in adoration to God Almighty, and with the other rebell'd againſt and endeavoured to murder his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.</p>

On the other ſide where theſe get the upper hand, what Maſſacres and Murders, what Blood and Rapine, what Ravages and Sacrilege do immediatly enſue? No reſpect then to Perſons, no reverence to Gray Hairs, no tenderneſs for Children, no piety for Infants, no compaſſion to the moſt lovely and charming Flowers of beautifull youth it ſelf.

            <p>That this is all Romance or but barely ſpeculation I wiſh our late unhappy times did not fully contradict, but (alaſs) we then ſo dearly experienc'd the miſchiefs of Sedition, and what direfull conſequences enſued when the Rebels were in the Saddle, that the leaſt apprehenſion of ſuch diſmal revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions may reaſonably affect as at the greateſt dread and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the burnt Child may juſtly fear the Fire a ſecond time.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> But in the laſt place let me reminde you to adhere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably  to that Church which remonſtrats againſt, and utterly abhors all <hi>Rebellious Principles</hi> and <hi>Practiſes:</hi> Now what Church that is, is Conſpicious to all the World by that indelible mark of Loyalty which is her proper badge and honour; I mean that <hi>truly Primitive</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical Church,</hi> the <hi>Church of England</hi> as now Eſtabliſhed; which never yet beſtowed the Kings ſupremacy on the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor huff'd him out of his power to beſtow it upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: It by no means can allow an entrenchment upon prerogative, and it as much deſires that property ſhould be ſecured by all honeſt and lawfull means: It ſues for mercy of the Prince, but it would not have the Subject abuſe it to ill purpoſes; and though it doth allow them a liberty in a regular way to do that which they judge to be beſt for themſelves, yet it by no means gives them leave to tell their Prince what he muſt do, or to thruſt themſelves in as ſpyes upon, or judges over his Actions: In fine it enjoyns us to obey him in all things that are lawful and honeſt, and if he commands us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it permits us not to Rebell, but bids us patiently ſuffer for what we cannot freely comply with.</p>
            <p>This is the avow'd doctrine of over Church (for which her fame may be juſtly celebrated our all the Chriſtian World) in which let us all with one conſent reſolve to live and dye; for where can we be taught better, or in what Communion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105490:15"/>
can we hope ſooner to gain Heaven then in this, whoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are ſo ſound, whoſe doctrine ſo pure, whoſe Rites and Ceremonies are ſo few and decent, and whoſe practiſes are all ſo agreeable to the firſt and pureſt ages of Chriſtianity. Which if once ſeriouſly conſidered would not only confirm us in this Faith, and make us firm to our Church, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade others too to enter again into the boſom of it, who have ſo perfidiouſly without any juſt grounds revolted from it.</p>
            <p>For why ſhould they any longer ſuffer themſelves to be deluded, and why ſhould they not ſuſpect that there may poſſibly be ſome corruptions in their Churches as well as any in ours? Now that there are both in principle and practiſe amongſt them I have undeniably demonſtrated, and would they but themſelves weigh both ſides impartially, and without prejudice lay things to Heart, they would be judges againſt themſelves and embrace our Communion: For what corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can be greater then thoſe that proceed from rebellious principles and Treaſonable practiſes, which their Churches ſtill do moſt certainly maintain, and never did yet by any publick Aſſembly or Remonſtrance diſclaim or openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce: and why then ſhould any be ſo ſcrupulous to hold Communion with our Church for fear of ſome imaginary cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and yet cleave to ſuch Churches as are viſibly more corrupt?</p>
            <p>Return then, O <hi>Shulamite,</hi> return, and if there be any ſtraglers now amongſt us, let me earneſtly begg of them to return to this our fold, that we may be all but one Flock under one Sheepherd Chriſt Jeſus: For 'tis now high time for men to ſee their errours, and if ſuch Treaſons and Conſpiracies as theſe, will not ſatisfie their conſciences that thoſe who are the Leaders and Abettours of them are falſe Teachers, and Wolves in Sheeps-cloathing; Heaven it ſelf cannot work ſuch mens converſion.</p>
            <p>But we heartily entreat you for the Kings ſafety, whoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105490:15"/>
life you all pretend ſo highly to value, and yet can never be ſecure, whilſt you ſo nicely diſtinguiſh betwixt his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and his Authority; for the Intereſt of theſe Kingdoms, in whoſe wellfare muſt needs conſiſt your happineſs, and yet your mutual Feers and Animoſities do dayly leſſen and undermine; and for the peace and comfort of your own ſouls, and that Faith and conſcience, which you lay ſo great a claim to, and yet ſo conſtantly Shipwrack by your obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Schifm and Separation, to believe theſe things to be really true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to become at laſt ſenſible that by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing theſe Loyal principles which our Church teacheth you, you will be certainly in the faireſt way to promote your beſt and chiefeſt Intereſt, that is, to do well and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per here, and to attain far greater degrees of felicity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; whereas all other Seditious Tenents expoſe men to certain unavoidable dangers, penalties, and misfortunes in this life; and hazard their eternal Salvation in that which is to come.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude all with that of<hi> Moſes, Deut. </hi>30. 19.<hi> I call Heaven and Earth to record this day againſt you, that I have ſet before you Life and Death, Bleſſing and Curſing, therefore chuſe Life that both thou and thy Seed may Live.</hi>
