            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Many old Manuſcripts and ruſty Records I turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over, but all in vain; at laſt I was informed by a Gentleman (whoſe Anceſtors by the Gift of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, enjoyed a <hi>Monaſtary</hi> in thoſe parts) that he had in his keeping ſome ancient Writings which would in that point ſatisfie my deſire, were they not ſo injured by Time, as now not legible to Read; however, I not deſpairing to find out their meaning, with much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity deſired to have a ſight of them; which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained, I took of the beſt Galls I could get, beat them groſly, and laid them to ſteep one day in good white-Wine, that done, I diſtilled them with the Wine; and with the diſtilled Water that came off them, I wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted handſomly the old Letters, whereby they ſeemed as

               </argument>
               <p>IN the Second Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, which was in the Year of our Lord One thouſand Four hundred Eighty and ſix; there lived a Woman called <hi>Agatha Shipton,</hi> at a place called <hi>Naſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> near the <hi>Dropping-Well in York-ſhire.</hi> She came of poor Parentage, who died and left her to ſhift for her ſelf, at the Age of fifteen. After their deceaſe, ſhe ſtill inhabited in the Old Houſe; but being now deprived of thoſe helps ſhe formerly enjoyed conducible to a lively-hood, ſhe was conſtrained to ſeek relief from the Pariſh? which ſhe did, but with ſo much regret and grief, that ſhe ſeemed in her begg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather to command Alms, then in an humble manner to deſire it. At length ſhe arrived to that paſs, that ſhe was upon the matter ſtarving, rather then ſhe would be beholding to the charity of any.</p>
               <p>The Devil looking on her poverty to be great, and knowing her evil inclinations by her completion (for you muſt underſtand, that the Devil is a great Scholar, well read in all things, and much acquainted with the conſtitutions of all ſorts of perſons.) I ſay, perceiving that ſhe was willing to accept of any propoſition to change her condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He one time as ſhe was ſitting Melancholy under a Tree by a River ſide, accoſted her in the form of a very handſome young man, well apparel'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55255:5"/>with all things ſuitable to a youthful garb. Pretty Maid, (quoth he) Why doſt thou fit ſo ſad? Thy age is too ſlender for thy head to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with cares of the World; come tell me what is the matter, and if it lie within my power to aſſiſt thee (as I am ſure it doth) thou ſhalt not want a friend of me.</p>

                  <hi>Agatha</hi> caſting up her eyes, and there ſeeing a face ſo lovely, could not ſuspect a Devil bid in that comely ſhape; whereupon in a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tone ſhe expreſt all that troubled her, informing him of her great wants, and that knowing not how to work, ſhe could not provide what her neceſſaries required: Piſh (ſaid the Devil) this is nothing, be ruled by me, and all ſhall be well; ſhe told him ſhe would; hereupon be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her to meet him at the ſame place the next day, and he would bring ſome friends along with him, for he told her he reſolved to marry her; ſhe promiſed him ſhe would, and accordingly they met. He came riding upon a ſtately Horſe, with a pillion behind for his Spouſe, attended by a great many Gallants (as they appeared) well mounted, and in a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble equipage.</p>
               <p>His Devilſhips attendants ſoon conveyed his Miſtris behind him, as ſhe imagined; not in the leaſt doubting the reality of all ſhe ſaw.</p>
               <p>They needed neither ſwitch nor ſpurr to haſten them forward, the Iades were fiery enough of themſelves, and ran with that ſwiftneſs that the wind could not over-take them in their full ſpeed; ſoon they arrived at their journies end, where ſeemed to be a very ſtately Houſe, with a great pair of Gates, which at their approach opened by a Porter with his ſtick, in his Livery-gown: Alighting, ſhe went in, where ſhe ſaw a great many ſervants, which ſeemed at the ſight of her and their Maſter, to ſhow much reſpect and obeiſance.</p>
               <p>Now did the Devil command rich Garments to be brought, which ſhe was immediately cloathed with, and being, thus richly attired, ſhe was uſhered into a great Hall, where was a long Lable furniſhed with all the Varieties the whole world could afford; at the upper end of which table ſhe was placed, next her the Friend her intended husband; all the reſt of the gueſts did place themſelves as they thought fit. As they had the choiceſt cheere, ſo had they the beſt of Wines, and ſweeteſt Muſick.</p>
               <p>Dinner being ended, they fell to Dancing; and now could my leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Devil ſtay no longer, but he muſt needs walk a co<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55255:5"/>ſimple Girle conſented, and ſo they both went to bed together, with the Ceremonies of Marriage. His touches (as ſhe confeſſed to the Midwife that delivered her of her Deviliſh Off-ſpring) were as cold as ice, or ſnow. After they had lain a little while together, he told her what he was, and what ſhe muſt do hereafter, if ſhe intended to live hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and delightful days. Firſt, he told her that he was no Mortal, but a Spirit immaterial, and not burdened by a body, nor hindred by any material thing; So that I can when I pleaſe pierce through the Earth and ranſack its Treaſures, and bring what precious things I pleaſe from thence to beſtow on thoſe that ſerve me. I know all rare Arts and Sciences, and can teach them to whom I pleaſe. I can diſturb the Element, ſtir up Thunders and Lightnings, deſtroy the beſt of things which were created for the uſe of man, and can appear in what ſhape, or form I pleaſe. It will be too long to diſcribe my power, or tell thee what I can do; but will only tell thee what thou ſhalt do. That being done, I will give ſhee power to raiſe Haile, Tempeſts, with lightning and Thunder; the Winds ſhall be at thy command, and ſhall bear thee whither thou art willing to go, though never ſo far off, and ſhall bring thee back again when thou baſt a mind to return. The hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den treaſures of the Earth ſhall be at thy diſpoſe and pleaſure, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be wanting to compleat thy happineſs here. Thou ſhalt moreover, heal or kill whom thou pleaſeſt; deſtroy or preſerve either man or beaſt; know what is paſt, and aſſuredly tell what is to come. Here note by the way, the Devil is a Lyar from the beginning, and will promiſe more by ten millions, than he knows he is capable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, to the intent he may inſnare and damn a Soul.</p>
               <p>This poor ignorant wretch eaſily believed what this Grand Deceiver of Man kind told her; and being raviſh't with the thoughts of being ſo highly prefer'd, ſhe condeſcended to all the Devil would have her do: Whereupon he bid her ſay after him, in this manner: <hi>Raziel ellimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham irammiſh ziragia Pſonthonphanchia Raphael elhaveruna tapino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tambecaz mitzphecat jarid cuman hapheah Gabriel Heydoncurris dungeonis philonomoſtarkes ſophecord hankim.</hi> After ſhe had repeated theſe words after him, he pluckt her by the Groin, and there immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately grew a kind of Let, which he inſtantly ſuckt, telling her that muſt be his conſtant Cuſtom with her morning and evening; now did he bid her ſay after him again, <hi>Kametzeatuph Odel Pharaz Tumbagin Gall Flemmngen Victow Denmarkeonto.</hi> having finiſht his laſt belliſh

Whilſt ſhe was thinking what courſe to ſteer in order to her return, two flaming fiery Dragons appear'd before her tied to a Chariot, and as ſhe was conſulting with her ſelf what was beſt to be done, ſhe inſenſibly was hoiſted into it, and with ſpeed unimaginable conveyed through the Air to her own poor Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>

                     <hi>How the Devil conſtantly viſited her, in what Forms and Shapes; what ſtrange things ſhe did to thoſe that offended her, harming ſome, and making ſport with others; and at length brought to Bed of a Child, which is commonly called,</hi> Mother Shipton.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEing come home, the Neighbours flockt about her, having miſt her two or three days, ſhrewdly ſuſpecting ſome miſchief had befallen her; but when they beheld her face they were all amazed, to ſee ſuch a ſtrange alteration in her countenance, in ſo ſhort a time; and here the Proverb was verified in her: <hi>She lookt as if a Hagg had rid her.</hi> Before ſhe met with this wanton Devil, ſhe lookt plump and freſh, which were all the good quallities ſhe had in her ill featured face; but now that red plumpneſs vaniſht, and there was nothing to be ſeen but a pale ſhriveled skin on her cheek, which for want of fleſh ſeemed to fall in her mouth, to be devoured by her hunger-ſtarved jaws. Thoſe about her which were charitable minded, pittied her, comforted and gave her monys, which with a great deal of diſdain and ſcorn ſhe threw them, ſaying, ſhe wanted not, nor ſtood in need of their Alms; for look ye here (ſaid ſhe) is many enough, plucking her hand out of her pocket, the people drawing near her, diſcovered that what was in her
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55255:6"/>hands, was nothing elſe but ſome <hi>Aſpin-leaves:</hi> and notwithſtanding, they endeavoured to perſwade her that ſhe was miſtaken in ſuppoſing that to be money, yet would ſhe not believe them; ſo ſtrong a Power the Devil had gotten over her already.</p>
               <p>In fine, ſhe did bid them all be gone, for now ſhe began to take little delight in humane Society: It was not long that they had left her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Devil (with whom ſhe made a Helliſh Contract) came in to ſee her, in the ſame handſome young form as he firſt appeared unto her, telling her that he came to ſupply the company of thoſe ſhe had wiſely diſmiſt, that ſhe needed not the Society of humane creatures, for he would not fail to he conſtantly with her; always bringing with him what ſhould not only ſerve for a bare Livelihood, but her Delight, Pleaſure, and Satisfaction: Hereupon by the Devil's command, there inſtantly appeared ſeemingly, a compleat noiſe of Muſick, with Diſhes of Meat, great variety of the choiceſt and moſt pleaſing ſort: which ſo raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Agatha,</hi> that ſhe fell to the ground in a very profound and deep trance. One of her Neighbours coming in this while, wondered to ſee <hi>Agatha</hi> lying on the floor motionleſs; however out of pity and commiſeration, ſhe kneeled down, and having croſt her ſelf, and ſaid a ſhort prayer, ſhe endeavoured to waken <hi>Agatha,</hi> but uſing what means ſhe could, it all ſignified nothing; ſhe ſhook and pincht her, and pulled her by the noſe, yet ſtill ſhe lay inſenſibly: This Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring-woman being ſtrangly amazed and ſcared hereat, ran out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt of the Neighbours, crying out, that poor <hi>Agatha Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was ſuddenly ſtruck dead, and ſo deſired them to go into the houſe with her, and they ſhould there be the eye-witneſſes of the truth thereof; whereupon ſeveral went and found what this woman had ſaid, to be ſeemingly true: but one wiſer then the reſt ſtooped down and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that ſhe breathed, ſpake aloud, Friends, ye are all miſtaken, <hi>Agatha</hi> is not dead, but in a trance, or elſe ſhe is bewitched; ſhe had ſcarce uttered theſe words before <hi>Agatha</hi> began to ſtir; and ſoon after, raiſed her ſelf on her leggs, crying out in a very diſtracted tone, What make ye here, vile wretches? Cannot I enjoy my pleaſures, but ye muſt be Ches-dropping? get ye gone, as having nothing to do here, and hereupon ſhe fell a dauncing, which they wondered at becauſe they could here no Muſick. At length <hi>Agatha</hi> turning about, and ſeeing they were not gone; ſaid, if ye are reſolved thus to diſturb me, and will not go, I will make ye: this ſomething affrighted them, for they now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55255:7"/>verily believed ſhe was a witch; and as they were haſtning away with all imaginable ſpeed, a ſudden ſtrong wind boiſted them a great height into the air, falling all to the ground again without the leaſt barm, only ſome ſhame to the women, for they deſcended with their heads downwards, their coats over their ears, their lower parts appearing all naked to the aſtoniſhed ſpectators; the men were ſeen like over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown Goats with larg horns on their heads, and women riding on their backs: which ſights as they produced inexpreſſible wonder, ſo amidſt their amazement, they could not but burſt out into exceſſive laughter.</p>
               <p>This wonderful and unexpected exploit, was inſtantly noiſed all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Countrey, which occaſioned a great reſort of people to the place where <hi>Agatha</hi> lived; which ſo perplext her by their undeſired viſits, that ſhe reſolved within her ſelf to be revenged on ſome of them; which by the Devils help ſhe effected; miſchieving ſome in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, others in their cartel, and others in their credits: one had a Horſe that dyed ſuddenly, and being opened, there was found in his ſtomack fiſh-books, and hair, inſtead of Hay and Dars. Another go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſit down at Table with perſons of good quality at dinner-time, and thinking himſelf very ſpruce and fine, had in an inſtant his Kuffe pull'd off, and the ſeat of an Houſe of Office clapt on in its place, he that ſate next him, breaking out into a great laughter at the ſight thereof, was ſerved little better; for his Hatt was inviſibly conveyed away, and the Pan of a Cloſe-ſtool which ſtood in the next room, put on inſtead thereof; A modeſt young Gentlewoman which did ſit at the Table at that time, on no other errand but to ſee this young witch which was ſo much talked of; looking on theſe two worthy ſpectacles of laughter, endeavoured all ſhe could to refrain laughing, but could not, and withal continued farting for above a quarter of an bour; this made them all laugh ſo extreamly that the Maſter of the houſe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum'd (below) therewith, and being deſirous to ſhare with his Gueſts in their mirth, came running up ſtairs as faſt as his legs would carry him, about to enter the door, he could not, and no wonder, ſince the oldeſt man living, never ſaw a larger pair of horns then he had on his head: Whilſt they were gazeing one on another as more then half diſtracted, they were all reduced to the ſame condition they were in before; after which there followed a noiſe, as if an hundred perſons were laughing together, but nothing at all was ſeen.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55255:7"/>
               <p>Theſe perſons fearing ſomething worſe might befal them if they ſtaid any longer, made all the haſt they could to be gone: <hi>Agatha</hi> knowing their intent reſolved to take her farwel of them by ſerving them one trick more, which was thus; As they were about to mount on Horſe-back, they were pelted with rotten Apples, Dung, and ſtuff that ſmelt worſe then can be imagined. As they rid through the Town, ſuch men as thought they rid ſingly, were all obſerved to have behind them a deformed old Woman; and as their Faces differ'd all one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo did their habits, which were all tatter'd and ragged, and patcht with a hundred colours, fear, ſhame, and the hooting of the people, made them put ſpurs to their Horſes, neither did they forbear the ſwitch, nor any thing that might add ſpeed to their Horſes heels, ſo that it may be ſaid, they rather flew then rode; how could it be otherwiſe? <hi>for needs muſt he go whom the Devil drives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Coming home, they declare what wonderful things they had ſeen performed, though by a young one, yet as they believed the greateſt witch in the world: this news being ſo generally ſpred, came at length to the ear of the Iuſtices, who now thought it high-time to queſtion and bring into examination a perſon that was ſo much talked of, and might, if let alone, do a great deal of miſchief.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How <hi>Agatha Shipton</hi> was apprehended and brought before a Juſtice; what her Confeſſion was, her Mittimus being made to be ſent to Priſon; how ſhe eſcaped by the help of her friend, the Fiend; ſhe is retaken, and being found with Child, is bail'd.</p>
               </argument>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agatha</hi> is now no longer ſuſpected, but plainly known to be a witch, doing ſomething or other daily which was very remarkable; ſhe hath been frequently obſerved to walk alone muttering to her ſelf, and having been watcht by ſome, they have ſeen her ſtamp upon the ground thrice, then wound her hands over her head, laſtly, ſhe ſpake one word thrice, and in the twinkling of an eye, the sky hath been dark and gloomy, though clear before, which belcht out nothing for half an hour but flames, thundring after a moſt hideous manner.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:55255:8"/>
               <p>But now the time draws on, wherein ſhe muſt give an account for what ſhe hath done, and in order thereunto, ſhe is apprehended by two reſolute fellows, who were not a whit daunted when they entred the houſe, though Toads, Adders, and ſuch like noiſome creatures crawled up and down the houſe, but could not chuſe but be much ſtartled when they ſeiz'd her and were carrying her, to hear ſuch a terrible crack of thunder, the houſe at that time reeling too and fro like a Cradle.</p>
               <p>However they carryed her before the Iuſtice, where being brought, ſhe was ſtrictly examined by him; ſhe not a jot daunted, told him that ſhe had more authority then he, and that notwithſtanding his power, ſhe could command one that could over-rule him when he liſt; That ſhe was a Princeſs, and could have at her beck a thouſand Spirits of the Air, and as many of the Earth and Water; That ſhe could raiſe a Tempeſt preſently, that ſhould overturn his houſe about his ears; and that you may know, it lies not in your power to detain me, three words ſhall procure my liberty: hereupon ſhe ſaid <hi>Updraxi,</hi> call <hi>Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicon Helluox,</hi> ſhe had not ſcarce uttered the laſt word, before there came in a horrid winged-Dragon, which immediately took her up, and carried her away from the amazed Iuſtice and Attendants about him, half dead with fear.</p>
               <p>This ſo affrighted all that heard of it, that none would undertake to meddle with her more; ſo that ſhe had a conſtderable time of reſpire. But ſhe now began to be more admired than before, being diſcovered by the great ſwelling of her Belly, to be with Child: The people could not tell what to think, or who ſhould be the Father, concluding that none would be ſo vile and wicked, as to have Copulation with a Devil incarnate; neither could they believe a Spirit had either deſire or power, to generate with any humane Creature; while people were generally paſſing their verdicts on <hi>Agatha,</hi> ſhe was once more taken and brought before a Iuſtice, and amongſt other queſtions, was asked, whether ſhe was with Child, ſhe acknowledged it; nay further, that it was begot by no mortal Wight: The Iuſtice gave no credit to what ſhe ſaid, as looking on her as an ignorant ſeduced Woman; and ſo askt her what Bail ſhe could produce, intending to deferr the buſineſs till ſhe was Delivered; in this very nick of time two Gentlemen as they appeared by their habits, voluntarily proffered themſelves, which as ſoon as accepted for Baile, vaniſh't preſently, however <hi>Agatha</hi> had permiſſion to go home.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>What kind of ſhape</hi> Mother Shipton <hi>had when ſhe was born: How ſhe was put to Nurſe at the charge of the Pariſh; and what ſtrange things were ſeen in that Houſe where ſhe was Nurſt, during the time of four years.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THe uſual time of forty weeks being expired, her Mother, after many ſtrange and horrible Torments which ſhe underwent in her Travil, was at laſt delivered (by the rare skill and induſtry of her Midwife, and others of that Sir) of her which is now called, <hi>Mother Shipton,</hi> which proved the concluſion of her miſerable Life. But her entry into the world was ſuch a terror to all that beheld her, that ſeveral credible perſons then preſent, have ſeveral times confeſt that they never beheld the like: Such ſtrange and horrible noiſes, that the perſons concern'd about her, could ſcarce find ſo much courage in themſelves as to continue in the place where ſhe was, much leſs when they beheld the ſtrange and unparrallel'd Phiſtognomy of the Child, which was ſo miſhapen, that it is altogether impoſſible to expreſs it fully in words, or the moſt ingennous to Limn her in colours, though many perſons of eminent qualifications in that Art have often attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, but without any ſucceſs; therefore according to the beſt obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her, take this true, though not full account of her features, and body: ſhe was of an indifferent height, but very moroſe and big hon'd, her head very long, with very great goggling, but ſharp and fiery Eyes, her Noſe of an incredible and unproportionable length, having in it many crooks and turnings, adorned with many ſtrange Pimples of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours, as Red, Blew and mixt, which like Uapours of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone gave ſuch a luſtre to her affrighted ſpectators in the dead time of the Night, that one of them confeſſed ſeveral times in my hearing, that her Nurſe needed no other light to aſſiſt her, in the performance of her duty: Her Cheeks were of a black ſwarthy complexion, much like a mixture of the Black and yellow jaundies; wrinckled, ſhrivelled and very hollow; inſomuch, that as the Ribs of her Body, ſo ſhe impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55255:9"/>of her teeth were eaſily to be diſcerned, through both ſides of her face, anſwering one ſide to the other, like the notches in a Ualley, excepting only two of them which ſtood quite out of her mouth, in imitation of the Luſhes of a wild Bore, or the Tooth of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, a thing ſo ſtrange in an Infant, that no age can parallel: Her Chin was of the ſame Completion as her Face, turning up towards her mouth, and ſhreeks being heard, from an unknown cauſe, as if there had been a more than an ordinary correſpondence between her Teeth and it.</p>
               <p>Her Neck ſo ſtrangely diſtorted, that her right ſhoulder was forced to be a ſupporter to her head, it being propt up by the help of her Chin, in ſuch ſort, that the right ſide of her Body ſtood much lower than the left; like the reeling of a Ship that ſails with a ſide winde. Again, her left ſide was quite turned the contrary way, as if her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had been ſcrew'd together piece after piece; and not rightly placed: her left ſhoulder hanging juſt Perpendicular to her Fundament.</p>
               <p>Her Leggs very crooked and miſhapen: The Toes of her feet look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards her left ſide; ſo that it was very hard for any perſon (could ſhe have ſtood up) to gueſs which road ſhe intended to ſtear her courſe; becauſe ſhe never could look that way ſhe reſolved to go.</p>
               <p>After ſhe had remained under the care of her Nurſe, for the ſpace of a Moon, or there abouts, her Mother being unable to provide for her, ſhe was put out to Nurſe at the charge of the Pariſh, to a poor Woman hard by in the Town, where ſhe continued for the ſpace of half a year or there abouts, the houſe not being any waies diſturbed at all, till at laſt her Nurſe having been abroad amongſt ſome of the chief of the Pariſhoners, either to procure ſomething of their Charity for her ſubſiſtance, and the maintainance of her Family, or elſe to fetch her money from the Overſeers of the Poor, for Nurſing the Child; and returning home to her Houſe, ſhe found her dores unbard and wide open, whereat ſhe much amazed and affcighted, ran to her next Neighbour, and acquainted her that ſhe was quite undone, for her houſe was brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en open and robbed; the man immediately riſeth from his Dinner, carrying his bread and Cheeſe in his hand, accompanied with his Wiſe and another labring man; approaching the door, endeavoured to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but before they could all get quite in, there was immediately a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange noiſe heard in the next Room to them as if it had been a conſort of Catts, which ſo affrighted them, that they all ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55255:10"/>the door endeavouring to get out again but it was in vain; for at their approach there were great long yoaks about their Necks, in the form of a Croſs, or turned ſtile; ſo that they could not poſſibly return; and while they were thus ſtriving and crying out for help; their yoaks at laſt fell off, and a cou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After they had got a diſcharge from this their new employment, the houſe being now quiet, and they a little recovered their ſences and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the women, they ran further into the houſe, where at laſt they found them lying flat upon their bellies, their clothes being turned backwards over their heads, two great black Catts were playing <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Pocus</hi> upon their poſters, which the men in vain attempted to drive away, untill at laſt their own ſtavery procured the womens freedom from that employment, though they changed not much for the better, for as they were coming out of that Room, in the next their ſtood a pair of Yarwingles, made in the form of a Croſs, uppon which wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men uſe to put great skains of Yarn, that ſo they may wind it off with more caſe and leſs trouble: Theſe being placed in the middle of the Room, the two men and two women were forced to take the four ends the e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ANd now <hi>Mother Shipton</hi> beginning to grow Famous in the World, for her notable Iudgment in things to come: There reforted to her Houſe a number of people, of all ſorts, both old and young, rich and poor; Eſpecially, of the Female Sex <hi>viz.</hi> Young Maids and Wenches, who have alwaies a great Itching deſire to know when they ſhall be Married; as alſo, what manner of Husbands they ſhall have; to which ſhe gave ſuch ſatisfactory anſwers, both for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and time; that no ſooner could a young Maid get into the Teens,

One day there came a certain young Heir thither, whoſe Father was ſick, to be reſolved by her, whether he ſhould live or die; but <hi>Mother Shipton</hi> could by no means be wrought upon to tell him any thing; whereupon he proffered the Maid great ſtore of Money, if ſhe could by any means perſwade her Dame, to fulfil his requeſt; the Wench greedy of Money, promiſed him fair; and that if he would come the next Morning, he ſhould be certain to be reſolved; in the mean time, ſhe importuned her Dame with the moſt cunning Rhetorick that ſhe could invent; but ſhe was deaf to all entreaties, and would by no means be induced thereto, whereupon the Wench reſolved with her ſelf, rather than to loſe the money, to give him an anſwer of her own intention; which the next morning ſhe performed in theſe words.</p>

               <p>Very remarkable was the day in which the Protector dyed, being the Third of <hi>September</hi> Anno <hi>1658,</hi> wherein the wind was ſo violent, that it overthrew many Houſes, tore up many Trees by the Roots, tumbled down Chimneys, and unreav'd Barns and Stables; but as it is a very ill <hi>wind that blows none good,</hi> ſo with all the burt this wind did, it made ſome recompence, in blowing this bloody Tyrant away, which made the people ſo little ſenſible of their loſſes, that they thought their private harms not to ſtand in competition with this general good.</p>
               <q>Confuſion ſhall a while bear ſway.</q>
               <p>Spoken in reſpect of the Confuſion of Governments we then had: Firſt, a Rump Parliament, then a Protector, next a Rump Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agen, then a Fools Bauble, called a <hi>Committee of ſafety,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Rump Parliament agen; now thus, then that, a great many Governments, and none good.</p>
