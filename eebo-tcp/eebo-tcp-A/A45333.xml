            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my Exposition on <hi>Hosea,</hi> I had occasion to consult the Prophet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> who was <hi>Hosea's</hi> Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary; and finding that Dr. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> Lady-<hi>Margaret</hi>-Professor in <hi>Oxford,</hi> had commented on that Prophecy; upon perusal I found that hee had expounded onely the three first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; whereupon, I finding the fourth to bee very suitable to our times, I onely set upon that, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to go any further; for the clouds thickned so fast over us, that I despaired of proceeding to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Chapter; but being incouraged by some to go on with so useful a work begun, I made a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Essay, and by a good hand of providence, have brought the work (totally beyond my own expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to a total perfection, having finisht the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the whole Prophecy.</p>
            <p>Many Posthumous works have had Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators surpassing their Predecessors, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee expected here. All that I can promise thee is this, that I have not baulkt any doubt or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
<pb facs="tcp:58817:4"/>
but have as fully and faithfully explained the Text as possibly I could; I have spared for no cost or pains, I have spent both Purse and Person freely in the work. 'Tis for the Lord, and I have not offered to him of that which cost mee nothing.</p>
            <p>I have studied brevity, the times will not bear long discourses, besides I naturally affect brevity, and love to see much matter compact together in a little room.</p>
            <p>Here thou hast Practicals, Polemicals, References, and what ever else might compleat the work.</p>
            <p>Here wee have a Glass wherein wee may see the Misery of Security, the Downfall of Sensuality and Idolatry, the Sword, Plague and Famine pursuing an obstinate and incurable people to destruction. Here wee have the sins that ruined <hi>Israel, viz. Oppression and Cruelty,</hi> Amos <hi>2.8.</hi> and <hi>8.6, 7. Bribery,</hi> Amos <hi>4.1</hi> and <hi>5.12.</hi> Notorious <hi>Lust,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos <hi>2.7.</hi> Odious <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> Amos <hi>2.9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</hi> Wilful <hi>Ignorance,</hi> Amos <hi>3.10. Hating of Reproof,</hi> Amos <hi>5.10, 13. Formality,</hi> and a Ceremonious Religion, <hi>Amos 5 21, 22. Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> in dealing, <hi>Amos 8.5.</hi> And <hi>Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of Gods worship, <hi>Amos 8.5</hi> And if these be <hi>Englands</hi> sins, these will be likewise <hi>Englands</hi> ruine. Parity of sin will bring parity in suffering. All the Symptomes of Iudgements approaching are

upon the Land. <hi>1</hi> Good men fall, <hi>Psa. 12.1. Isa. 57. 1. 2</hi> Ill men rise, <hi>2 Chron. 19.2. Psal. 12. ult. 3</hi> Gods Vine, the Church, is grown wilde and luxuriant for want of pruning; Professors are turned Blasphemers, and instead of the Grapes of Obedience, they bring forth the wilde Grapes of Apostacy, Idolatry, Security, Pride and Hypocrisie. Wee grow weary of Mannah, and long to be at our Garlick and Leeks, and Onions in <hi>Egypt</hi> again. It was the great sin of <hi>Israel,</hi> that when the Lord had brought them out of <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage into <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet then they cryed, <hi>Come let us make us a Captain, that so wee may return into Egypt again,</hi> Numb. <hi>14.4.</hi> Such horrid Apostacy alwaies ends in misery, <hi>Isa. 1.4, 7. Ezek. 9.9. Heb. 10.38.</hi> Besides, the sad divisions and subdivisions which are amongst us fore-tell some approaching Iudgement. Wee cannot gratifie Antichrist more, than to weaken our selves by our divisions. <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is like a great Animal (as the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> hath well observed) and cannot dye unless she help to kill her self. Like a Diamond, she is not so easily broken with hammers and swords, as she is cut in peeces with her own dust. 'Twas our divisions at first that brought in the <hi>Romans, Normans,</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> into this Land; what they may do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, a little time will shew.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58817:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>Many amongst us have run round to Popery, and therefore 'tis just with God to make that the scourge, which so many have made their refuge; and after the Rod hath done its work, then hee'l burn it; God is letting Antichrist loose once more, to hasten his fall; the more blood he sheds, the greater will the cry be against him. The measure of <hi>Babylons</hi> sins will be made up in blood before her final ruine; and when she shall have once more filled her self with the blood of the Saints, she shall have blood given her to drink, for she is worthy.</p>
            <p>The good Lord awaken us, and humble us all for our own sins, and for the sins of the times we live in, and make us to mourn for the things wee cannot mend, and inable us to receive the Truth in the love of it, and make us at last to serve him with gladness of heart, in the abundance of all things, that wee may not provoke him to make us serve our enemies in want and misery.

            <p n="2">2 We have the Judgements denounced against them for those Sins, set forth by a double Metaphor, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Here is the confirmation of this threatning. 1 By the Oath of God, <hi>I have sworn by my Holiness, saith the Lord,</hi> that I will bring evil upon them; and secondly, their Sins have justly deserved it: for 1. They are a People given up to Idolatry, and hypocritical worshipping of me, <hi>vers.</hi> 4.5. 3. They were indurate, impenitent, and incorrigible under variety of former judgements, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. to 12. The Prophet names Six.</p>

            <p n="5">5 Seeing their incorrigibleness, the Prophet goeth on to denounce a sorer and sharper Judgement than any yet had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln them, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. <hi>Therefore thus will I doe to thee O Israel.</hi> The Judgement was so dreadful that the Prophet seems una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to express it, and therefore he doth as 'twere draw a Vail over what he could not in words express: with a <hi>Thus will I doe unto thee</hi>; q. d. since nothing will move thee, I will bring upon thee some direful desolation, and utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,

            </p>
            <p n="6">6 He concludes the Chapter with an Exhortation to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, calling upon them to prepare to meet the Lord, by unfeigned Humiliation, and Reformation, that so they might prevent those Judgements which were yet coming upon them, <hi>vers.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The better to awaken them he useth two Motives, the first is drawn from the dreadfulness of the impending Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which since they were not able to resist, hee exhorts them to prevent, considering also the advantage they had of a Covenant yet in being betwixt God and them, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. The second is drawn from the Majesty and Power of God, who was marching in wrath against them.</p>
            <p>In the first Verse the Prophet prosecutes the Charge which hee had begun (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.9, 10.) against the Rulers and Judges of <hi>Israel,</hi> for their cruelty in oppressing the poor and needy. These usually are ring leaders in sin, their examples incourage others in wickedness, and therefore the Prophet begins his Charge against them; and after descends to the Priests and People, who were confederate with them in their wickedness.

               <hi>Yee Kine of Bashan.</hi> Thus he calls these wicked, wealthy, wanton Rulers, who managed the affairs of the Kingdom for the King, and did abuse their power to the oppressing of the poor; those feasted and fatted themselves with the spoyls of the poor whom they opprest in judgement; and therefore the Prophet calls them not men, but Beasts, and fat Bawsons, whose hearts were fat as grease: and their eyes star'd out with fatness; they were stupid, and therefore he useth sharp ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, the better to awaken them; he speaks to them in the feminine Gender (not because they were Women, as some conceive, for the sins which he reproves are more proper to men, especially the Rulers of a People) but because of their effeminate, wanton condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given to their bellies,<note place="margin">

            <p n="2">2 He calls them Kine of <hi>Bashan,</hi> because of the plenty of fat Cowes, and rich Pastures in that Country; hence we read of the fatlings of <hi>Bashan,</hi> Ezek. 39.18. and Rams of the brood of <hi>Bashan,</hi> Deut. 32.14. now the Rulers of <hi>Samaria</hi> were like the Kine of <hi>Bashan,</hi> loaded with fatness, secure and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with worldly wealth and pleasures, insomuch as they sleighted the Word of God, and contemned the Prophets which publisht it unto them, and so became like fat Beasts fitted for the slaughter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caution.</hi> The Lord doth not here simply condemn them for their Riches (which are blessings simply considered in themselves) but for the abuse of their riches and power. 1.

               <hi>Q<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Are we not forbidden to revile the Rulers of the People, and commanded to give no offence to any, and therefore</hi> Paul <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all things to all men that hee might win them,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.32, 33.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We are forbidden <hi>reviling</hi> of Rulers, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 28. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.5.) but never <hi>reproving</hi> of them, neither is this an offence <hi>given,</hi> but unjustly <hi>taken</hi> by them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We must distinguish between private reproaches, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical reproofs; for a Minister in the name of the Lord to reprove men for their open enormities is no rayling, nor revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but a faithful discharge of that duty which God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted them with, and strictly under severe penalties enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.33. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20. and all the Prophets, with Christ and his Apostles, did practice it. Now <hi>Amos</hi> was a Prophet of God, and so by vertue of his Office might doe that which a private person who wants that Call, may not doe; besides, he being called extraordinarily, he had an extraordinary measure of the Spirit, hee knew the projects and practises of these ungodly great ones, and so might the more boldly reprove them. Hence <hi>David</hi> calls wicked men <hi>Doggs, Lions, Bulls,</hi> Psal. 22.12, 13.21.22. and <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son calls wicked Princes hungry Bears, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.15. and <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Nero</hi> a <hi>Lion,</hi> and Christ calls <hi>Herod</hi> a

               <hi>Fox,</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi> here calls them fatted <hi>Cowes.</hi> This down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Prophet being not bred at Court, nor coming from the <hi>Hall,</hi> where men use silken words, and lofty titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but coming from the <hi>Stall,</hi> according to his blunt and rustick language, he calls a Spade a Spade, and such as neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected their duties to pamper their Carkasses, he calls Beasts, not men; <hi>q. d.</hi> their flatterers look upon them as so many Heroes, and Gods on earth, but I that have seen their loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some lusts, doe look upon them as so many fat Bulls, filthy Swine, and unruly Heifers, that will not bear the yoke of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To that of the Apostle, in becoming all things to all men; 1. It was in all lawful things, and such as rended to the edification, and not to the destruction of any, 2. It was only in such things as are left indifferent by the Word of God, and in this sence only the Apostle became all things to all men, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19, 20, 21, 22.) amongst the Gentiles hee walks, as one that was not under the Ceremonial Law, that he might win them, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.19, 20. and amongst the <hi>Iewes</hi> he obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Ceremonial Law, that hee might not offend them, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.3. &amp; 18.18.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It is the favour of men which is gained by flattering and unlawful means, which the Scripture condemns, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Doe I seek to please men? then should I not bee the Servant of Christ</hi>; the Interrogation is a strong Negation, <hi>q. d.</hi> when I was a Pharisee I pleased men, and followed their Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but now I desire in singleness of heart to approve my self to God.</p>
            <p n="5">5 When the favour of men is sought in the first place, this cannot stand with sincerity, but when it is cast in upon us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a faithful discharge of our duty, wee may thankfully and joyfully receive it. It is said of Christ that he grew in favour first with <hi>God,</hi> and then with <hi>men,</hi> Luke 2.52. and it was <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Honour, that <hi>he had a good report of all men, yea and of the truth is self,</hi> 3 Joh. 12. It is possible for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian so to live that he may approve himself both to God and man; Christ walked so convincingly, that the Pharisees com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that <hi>all the world went after him,</hi> (Joh. 12.19.) and no wonder, since all the world was made by him; it is prudence therefore for a Minister so to live, and so to act; that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58817:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if it be possible (without detriment to the truth, and a good conscience) he may have peace with all men. A free, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and prudent discharge of his duty is the only way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this.</p>

               <p>THe Prophet continues his Threatning, as appears by the Copulative, <hi>And, yee shall goe out of the Breaches.</hi> Hee amplifies their calamity by that fear and consternation which should surprize them; the walls of <hi>Samaria</hi> being broken down, those Grandees which before went in great state and order, should now confusedly, like so many frighted Beasts, flee out at every breach to save themselves; so that in this Verse we have, as in the former, 1. <hi>A Commination,</hi> or Judgement threatned, <hi>Yee shall goe out at the breaches.</hi> 2. A confirmation of this Commination, <hi>saith the Lord.</hi> The bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to awaken them he adds this again, that they had not to doe with man, but with the Almighty, who will not be mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor dallied withall.</p>
               <p>The Prophet goes on in directing his speech to the Nobles, Judges, and Counsellours of the Land, though he spare not the inferiour sort, yet because the Rulers were the ring-leaders in sin, therefore he bends his speech principally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Every Cow at the breach which is before her</hi>; that is to say, any way, for they had neither Gates nor Walls whole. Valiant men keep their ranks and files in despight of all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.7, 8. but faint-hearted, fearful sinners shift for themselves, and take the next gap to run out at. As beasts when chased, run on heaps disorderly, so these fly from their enemies tumultuously, and confusedly, without any respect to their companions; seeking only to save themselves, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.14, 15, 16.</p>

               <p>THe Prophet goes on with his Charge against <hi>Israel,</hi> and that the justness of Gods Judgements, which he threatned to bring upon this people might bee made apparent to the world, he comes to set forth their gross <hi>Idolatry,</hi> together with their obstinacy and induration therein, insomuch as no Punishments could work upon them; this makes the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with a most biting and bitter Sarcasm, saying, <hi>Goe to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel and transgress.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prophet had before charged them with <hi>cruelty,</hi> now he upbraids them for their Idolatry, and false-worship, set up by <hi>Ieroboam</hi> their first King, augmented by many of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings, and endured so long as the Kingdom endured; till at last it brought them into Captivity,<note place="margin">In my Com. on <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.16</note> as I have shewed at large elsewhere.</p>
               <p>The Prophet here by a <hi>Prolepsis,</hi> prevents an Objection, whereas they might think to escape Gods Judgements by their Sacrifices, and Idolatrous services; the Prophet tells them, that this is so farre from pacifying Gods wrath, that it incens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him the more against them, and therefore to express his great indignation against them, hee sarcastically bids them, <hi>Goe to Bethel and transgress, &amp;c.</hi>

Goe on also in your Hipocrisie; and the Worship which I have appointed to my People, that doe yee imitate, bring your Morning Sacrifices which are due to me, and offer them to your Idols; and that which the Law required of you, for the maintenance of my Levites and the Poor, viz. to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the Tithes of every third year for pious and charitable uses;

The <hi>Macedonians</hi> had Families to provide for, yet they relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved others beyond their ability (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.3.) though they had but little themselves, yet out of that little they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give somewhat.</p>

The Lord <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> had but one thousand pound <hi>per annum</hi> (which was but a mean estate to maintain a Lord and his followers) yet out of that hee spared one hundred pound <hi>per annum</hi> for pious uses.</p>

Hence the Lord commands his people, to <hi>leave some gleanings for the fatherless and the widow</hi>; Why so? <hi>That God may bless thee in the work of thy hands,</hi> Deut. 24.19, 20. all thy carking and caring is but lost, if God give not his blessing; many have scraped abundance of pelf together for a prodigal Heir, that hath in a trice consumed all.

Wee see the Wheel turns round, and those that have been on the top, as <hi>Bajazet</hi> and <hi>Belisarius,</hi> have been brought to the bottom; we should therefore improve our Talent while we have it, to our Masters praise. God hath much dishonour done him by miserable, unmerciful men; we should help to take off those dishonours by our pious, merciful, and munificent walking; they instead of giving bountifully, give basely to the poor, mouldy-bread, stinking meat, that one would scarce give to Doggs; yea their horses many times have more and better Corn than poor wanting Christians.

               <p>IN this Verse the Prophet continues his Sarcasm, and bids the <hi>Israelites</hi> goe on in their superstitious practices, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Gods people in their choysest Sacrifices, <hi>viz.</hi> in their Eucharistical, Votive, Free-will-offerings; but withall he lets them know, though this please them, yet it displeaseth God, as appears by those several Judgements which hee had
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58817:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
already laid upon them, and yet further threatens against them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Offer a Sacrifice of Thanksgiving with leaven</hi>; q. d. imitate Gods people, who in their Sacrifices of praise did offer leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread according to the Law (<hi>Levit.</hi> 7.13.) so doe yee in the VVorship of your Idols, what Gods people did holily at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to the true God, that doe yee hypocritically at <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Gilgal,</hi> to your false gods.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But here a doubt ariseth, whether this people did sin in offering leaven with their Sacrifices of Thanksgiving?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Some learned men conceive they did sin, and that their Sacrificing here with leaven was contrary to the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 2.11. But as learned men on the other side say, they did not sin in so doing; for though the Lord did forbid leaven in other Sacrifices (<hi>Levit.</hi> 2.11.) yet in Eucharistical and Thank-offerings, as here, they might bring leavened bread, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.13. The Lord therefore doth not blame them here for offering with leaven,<note place="margin">

                  </note> for himself had so appointed it, and in these external circumstantials they were very diligent; but the Lord blames them because they offered those Sacrifices of praise which were due to him, to their Idols, and that in the Temple of Idols.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But why did the Lord forbid leaven in other Sacrifices, and yet command it in Eucharistical ones?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Sundry Reasons might be given.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Lord might enjoyn it, to intimate unto us the due preparation of our hearts before we praise him; for so wee finde <hi>Leaven</hi> to be used, sometimes in Scripture in good part, for the secret working, preparing, and fitting of the Dough for baking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> making it rise and heave, which else would bee sad and heavie (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.33.) so doth Gods Spirit prepare and raise our spirits in love and thankfulness to God for his mercies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 108.1. to 6.</p>

               <p>WHen God would convert a People, he useth Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and Curses, Mercies and Judgements, one or both of which usually work upon all ingenuous natures, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. &amp; 30.1, 2. God had tried all conclusions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this people, he had tried to reclaime them by Mercies, (<hi>Amos</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. &amp; 3.2.) but these being ineffectual, he now tries what Judgements will doe; and therefore sends his three Arrowes of Famine, Pestilence, and Sword amongst them to convert them (if it might be) and not to destroy them, as appears by that Emphatical Epistrophe annext to every punishment; <hi>yet have yee not returned unto me, saith the Lord.</hi> Not only his Mercies, but his Menaces; not only his favours, but his frownes and rods were all ineffectual upon the hearts of this impenitent people. As a tender father will use all means to reclaime his rebellious Son, so God had used all means to reclaim this People from their Idolatry, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy, but all in vain, for they were so wedded to their lusts, that they had rather lose their Land and Lives than part with them; so that this is the third Sin which the Lord

by his Prophet chargeth them withall, viz. <hi>Obstinacy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibleness</hi>; no cords of love could draw them, nor judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drive them. The Lord had wasted all his <hi>rods</hi> on them in vain, five or six he mentions here, <hi>viz.</hi>

This Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in part fulfilled in <hi>Elijahs</hi> and <hi>Elishaes</hi> dayes, when in <hi>Ahabs</hi> reign there was a three years famine, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.1. and in the dayes of King <hi>Ioram,</hi> for the Idolatry that then reinged, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.38. yet some conceive that the Prophet here speaks of some latter famine which was then fresh in their memories.</item>

                  <p n="2">2 Obs. <hi>God payes Sinners many times in their own coyn.</hi> As men deal with others, so God deals with them. These Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous <hi>Israelites</hi> kept Gods faithful Ministers hungry, and spent all on Idols, and false Prophets, and now God keeps them hungry; they like fat Beasts were luxurious, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their food, and now they shall be kept short, and want food; they abused their Wine; and now they shall want Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and though Great men many times escape in times of

famine, yet God can smite them with such Diseases, that they shall neither eate nor drink, <hi>In quo quis pescat, in eo puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.

Such is our corruption that we seldome know the worth of Mercies till we want them, <hi>Carendo potius quam fruendo,</hi> when wee want food, health, wealth, peace, and the Gospel of Peace, then wee begin to know the price of these mercies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Obs. <hi>The principal end that God aimes at in our correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is our conversion.</hi> He corrects us for our profit, that wee might be partakers of his Holiness,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Dyke</hi> on Afflictions, p. 342. &amp;c. at the end of his Com. on Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon.</note>

They are as senseless of what is spoken as the Pillars which they leane to, or the Seats which they sit upon; so that many men come short of the very faith of Devils; for they beleeve there is a God, and that all which he hath spoken in his Word is true; they beleeve the Power, Justice, and Wrath of God so far as to tremble at it, and herein they goe beyond most wicked men, who never goe so farre as to quake and tremble at Gods threatnings, yea the Devil hath taught them a lesson which he cannot learn himself, <hi>viz.</hi> to mock at Gods threatnings, saying in their hearts they shall never come upon us.<note place="margin">See this Point very well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, by Mr. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How many are corrected, but not amended; beaten, but not bettered; this doubles mens sins and makes them out of measure sinful, when neither the Word nor the Sword, neither Mercies nor Menaces, neither Promises nor Threatnings can work upon men; when sin is grown too strong for that means which God hath ordained to suppress it, they are nigh to utter destruction. This plainly appears by this people of <hi>Israel,</hi> after their defection and Apostacy from the Worship of God, they never Prospered but had one Judgement after another till they were quite destroyed. We are apt to wonder at <hi>Israels</hi> induration, and yet this is <hi>Englands</hi> Sin.

                     <p>And I also have with-holden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the Harvest; and I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to raine upon one City, and caused it not to raine upon another City; one peece was rained upon, and the peece whereupon it rained not, withered.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THe Prophet descends to the enumeration of new Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, two of which were the <hi>Causes of the Famine.</hi> The first was Drought, and want of Rain, <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 8. The second was Blasting, Mil-dew, and the Palmer-worm, <hi>vers.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>This People were like Clouds without water, and yeelded no obedience to God, but followed Idols; and now his clouds have no water for them. When God is against us all are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us; so that here we have a second Scourge, where-with the Lord chastised this people that he might bring them home to himself, <hi>viz.</hi> Drought and Barrenness; he had before pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht them with Famine, and want of Bread, now he punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them with Thirst, and want of Water. Thus the Lord tried all conclusions to better them, but in vain, as will appear by the sequel.</p>
               <p>In this Verse we have 1. The efficient cause of this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Manang, cohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bui, prohibui, coercui.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I have with-holden the rain from you, viz.</hi> the latter rain, which that hot Country had most need of, I have forbidden it to fall upon you, saith God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Here is the continuance of the Judgement, it was not for a week or two, but for three months, even till the fruits of the earth withered and were destroyed, and this the Lord did, the more deeply to affect them with their sins. One months want of rain, in that hot Country especially, should have startled them, two months should have astonisht them, but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58817:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
three months should have fully awakened them, yet such was their gross senslesness and stupidity, that they laid it not to heart. And therefore the Lord the better to set forth his patience, and this peoples impenitency, sets forth his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings particularly with them, and tells us how he brought the <hi>Famine,</hi> the <hi>Drought,</hi> the <hi>Palmer-worm,</hi> and the <hi>Pestilence, &amp;c.</hi> upon them. He came not suddenly upon them, but gave them space to repent, and time to consider their wayes, and the tokens of his displeasure against them. But such was their obstinacy and malice, that nothing could work upon them, their Disease was too strong for the Physick, and their Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for Gods remedies, his labour was lost upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Here is the juncture of time when this rain was with-held from them, <hi>viz.</hi> three months before Harvest, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>March,</hi> for about the latter end of <hi>May</hi> in that hot Country was their Harvest; this was called <hi>the latter rain,</hi> and was very needful to fit, fill, and ripen the Corn for Harvest. For the better understanding of this, we must know that the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was not like the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> they seldome or never had any rain (<hi>Zech.</hi> 14.18.) for the River <hi>Nilus</hi> did once a year over-flow the greatest part of their Country, and so did mellow and soften the earth for all the year after. But <hi>Canaan</hi> was a mountanous place, and could not be so watered, and therefore the Lord took more special care of it, and watered it with rain from Heaven, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 11.10, 11.) In this Land there were two more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special seasons for rain, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>former rain</hi> about <hi>September,</hi> when the Seed was sown, that it might take the better root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the <hi>latter rain</hi> in the Spring time, when the Corn was grown up and earing, to fit it for the Harvest; and this was called the <hi>latter rain,</hi> which is said to fall in the first month, that is, in <hi>March,</hi> which with them was the beginning of the year, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.23. Hence are those frequent expressions in Scripture of <hi>the former and the latter rain, Deut.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Zech.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.7. for in Harvest it seldome or never rained in those hot Countries, and therefore when <hi>Samuel</hi> by Prayer had obtained rain in Harvest, they looked upon it as a prodigious thing, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.16, 17, 18, 19. now the want of either of these rains was sad, but speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the latter, when a man shall see his Corn sown, grown
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58817:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
up, and then when he expects a Harvest after all his pains, for want of rain to have it wither and dye before his eyes, this must needs be grievous to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Here is the accurateness of Gods Judgements, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth between City and City, Feild and Feild, <hi>I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to rain upon one City, and not upon another.</hi> As hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Sun to shine on <hi>Goshen,</hi>

               <p n="5">5 Here is the effect of this Judgement, it makes them run from City to City for water (<hi>vers.</hi> 8.) but in vain, for they could not get enough to satisfie their necessities. They were sensible of bodily wants, but insensible of Spiritual wants, and therefore</p>
               <p n="6">6 The Lord concludes with the usual Epostrophe, <hi>Yet have yee not returned unto me, saith the Lord.</hi> Though they were thus sadly afflicted, yet were they not bettered, but remained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable under all corrections.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Want of seasonable rain is a punishment for sin.</hi> When God is angry with a People, then hee with-holds the former and the latter rain from them. God hath rain enough in store, but it is our sins which keeps in from falling upon us; his hand is not shortned that it cannot save, but it is our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity that turns away good things from us; these shut the Heavens, and make them hard as Iron, so that they cannot heare the earth, when (in its kind) it gapes and cries for rain, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.23, 24. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.9, 10. it is obedience that brings rain. Those Cities that were rained upon in the text, some conceive to have been godly Cities which hated Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and worshipped the true God, though the text will not bear such a glosse, for God makes his Rain, which is but a common Blessing, to fall in the Wilderness (<hi>Iob</hi> 38.26, 27.) and upon the unjust as well as upon the just; yet it is most certain that Piety hath the promise even of Temporal blessings, and such as are faithful with God in Spirituals, shall

                  <p n="2">2 Obs. <hi>Rain falls by appointment, and not by accident; by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and not by chance.</hi> It is not the Sun, the Moon, the Starres, or any other Natural cause, much less any Idols that can procure raine; but it is the Lords Prerogative Royal to give and order rain, <hi>it is he that makes it rain on one City, and not on another.</hi> The <hi>Clouds</hi> are Gods Servants, hee bids them goe rain here and not there, and they exactly obey his commands (<hi>Iob</hi> 37.11, 12, 13.) hence they are called <hi>His Clouds,</hi> (Job. 26.8.) 1.

Hence God is called the Father of the rain, <hi>Iob</hi> 38.28. &amp; 36.27, &amp; 37.6.2. They are his Clouds in respect of <hi>Subserviency,</hi> they are no sooner produced but they are presently acting in their sphere, and region for their Lord and Master, one while raining on this Country, and anon on that; These are Gods Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots with which hee waters the World, the <hi>Bottles of Heaven,</hi> (<hi>Iob</hi> 38.37.) out of which God sends rain to refresh the earth and make it fruitful; he crowns the year with his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, when he makes his Clouds to drop down fatness on us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65.12. The earth is as it were Gods Garden, the Sea his Cistern, and the Clouds his Bottles to refresh the earth, and mollifie it, and make it fit for our service. This is a great mercy, let not the commonness of it take away the sense of it; but let us fear to offend him who gives us rain; God takes it ill when we slight his Providence in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5.24. neither say they, let us fear the Lord, who giveth the former and the latter rain <hi>q. d.</hi> what a strange thing is this that the sweet showers of rain have not softned

Such Atheistical practices may justly provoke the Lord to blast thy Corn indeed. Little better is that of the Popish Processions about the Fields, with Flaggs, and Banners, and Bables.

               <epigraph>
                  <q>I have sent among you the Pestilence after the manner of Aegypt, your young men have I slaine with the sword, and have taken away your horses, and I have made the stink of your Camps to come up into your nostrils; yet have yee not returned unto me, saith the Lord.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN this Verse we have a Fourth and Fifth Rod, where-with the Lord chastned this stubborn people, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pestilence,</hi> and the <hi>Sword.</hi> Before they were smitten with the <hi>Famine,</hi> which rich men many times feel not; now follows the <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Sword,</hi> as usual Concomitants on the former; hence all these three are so oft joyned together in Scripture. These meet with the rich, as well as the poor; yea the Sword ayms prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally at rich men; Souldiers doe not use to enquire, where dwells the poor man, but where dwells the Vsurer, the rich Oppressor, &amp;c. the poor scape best many times in such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustions, <hi>Ier.</hi> 39.20.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>The Question will be, what</hi> Pestilence <hi>this was, and when it fell upon</hi> Israel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is conceived that the Pestilence of <hi>Aegypt</hi> here meant, was not any one particular Plague, but a complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Plagues; and specially the Fifth and Tenth Plague of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which brought <hi>Murrain on the Cattle, and Mortality on men.</hi> First, there was so great and so grievous a destruction of Cattel, that all the Horses, Asses, Camels, and all the Cattel of <hi>Aegypt</hi> dyed (<hi>Exod.</hi> 9.6, 9.) 2 All their first-born dyed, there was not a house in which there was not one dead, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.29. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.50, 51. so it was amongst this people, there was a sore slaughter both of men and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. The Prophet seems to allude to the dayes of King. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoahaz</hi> King of <hi>Israel;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See my Com. on Hos. 13.16. p. 143.</note> when the King of <hi>Syria</hi> made so great a slaughter amongst them, that of the whole Army of <hi>Israel</hi> there were left but fifty Horse-men, ten Chariots, and ten thousand Foot, all the rest were destroyed, and made like the dust by threshing (2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.7.) Hereupon the Air was corrupted, and the loathsome stench of so many dead Bodies, helpt to bring the Pestilence amongst them.</p>

                     <note place="margin">See more in my Com. on Hos. 13.16. p. 68.</note> Blasting, Mildew, Palmer-worms did not work upon this People, and now comes Pestilence and Sword, Gods great Rods to destroy them utterly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Obs. <hi>Iudgements, especially great ones, seldome goe alone,</hi> Sword, Plague, Famine, often goe together. As men multiply Sins, so God multiples Plagues; and as they have variety of sins, so he hath variety of punishments, as I have shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on Vers. 8. Obs. 2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Obs. <hi>Parity of Sin, brings parity of Iudgement.</hi> The <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> were obstinate Idolaters, no Plagues could work upon them, therefore God destroyed them. And this was <hi>Israels</hi> case, they were obstinate Idolaters like the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and now God follows them with Plague upon Plague as hee did them, <hi>I have sent upon you Pestilence after the manner of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> They were incurable and incorrigible like the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and now God smites them with <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Plagues, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that threatning, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.61. <hi>I will cause the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of</hi> Aegypt <hi>to cleave unto thee.</hi> Sin hardens Gods heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his people, and makes him deal with them, as hee useth to doe with his enemies. It turns him, who is our best friend, into the saddest foe. That power which he used in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying his peoples enemies, if his people forsake him, and rebel against him, hee will exert that power in destroying them. Thus the Lord used here the same weapons of his wrath against his people, as before hee used in destroying the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And may not <hi>England</hi> now fear, lest that power, which the Lord hath shewed in the saving of us from the hands of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable men, should now bee turned against us for our Blasphemies; and Apostacies? and as we have partaken with <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manies</hi> sins, and <hi>Polands</hi> sins, and <hi>Irelands</hi> sins; so wee

should be made like them for plagues. Wee have given the Lord just cause by our provocations to turn his hand against us, and to consume us after he hath done us good. (<hi>Iosh.</hi> 24.20.) And as hee hath made us the head, so now hee might make us the tayl; and as he hath made us the terror of the Nations, so now he may justly make them a terror to us for our ungrateful, dis-ingenuous walking towards him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Obs. <hi>The Pestilence comes more immediately from God</hi>; It is his Messenger, it is commanded and commissioned by God, to goe to such and such Families, Towns, and Persons, that so if any one ask, How came the Pestilence here, why <hi>I sent it said God</hi>; it is a servant of his sending, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.15 and an Arrow of his shooting, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.5. with this hee wounds, kills, and consumes his enemies, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.16, 17. The Plague is not <hi>Casual,</hi> but <hi>Providential,</hi> there is a Divine hand of immediate Providence in this Judgement; as there is no evil of affliction in the City, so much less this signal evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it comes from God, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. It is he that decrees it, he increaseth it, and he removes it, how and when he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Hence it is called his <hi>Sword,</hi> 1 Chron. 21. <hi>ult.</hi> it is not the sword of a weak man, but of an Almighty God, which none can resist or fly from; it is his <hi>Hand</hi> out of which none can deliver us, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.14. <hi>Moses</hi> tells <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that if he refuse to let <hi>Israel</hi> goe, behold <hi>the hand of the Lord,</hi> i. e. the Plague shall light on thy Cattel, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.3. this hand of his will finde out all his enemies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 21.8. this is a sign of Gods great Wrath.

                  <p>As 1. <hi>Idolatry.</hi> This is a God-provoking, and a Land-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Sin, and brings the Plague upon a Land, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.29. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.2, 11.</p>

                  <p n="6">6 <hi>Prophanation of holy things.</hi> This brought the Pestilence (as it is conceived) upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.30. he will be sanctified of all that draw nigh unto him; in <hi>mercy</hi>

                  <p>Wee should therefore be careful by unfeigned Repentance and Humiliation to remove Sin which is the cause, and then the Plague which is but the effect will soon cease; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, all Physick, flying, washings, burning, &amp;c. are but vain. Till God bee appeased, the Plague will never bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased; till we humble our selves before him, he will not heal us, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.13, 14. till by <hi>faith</hi> we fly unto him, he will not hide us from the Pestilence, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.1. to 8.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 This speaks <hi>Terror</hi> to the wicked and impenitent; they have not to doe with men in this Judgement, but with God, who is a consuming fire, and from whom there is no flying, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.1. to 5. when men oppose men, they may make some resistance; but when <hi>Omnipotency</hi> comes against <hi>Impotency,</hi> and the <hi>Creator</hi> against the <hi>Creature,</hi> whose heart can be strong, or whose hands endure? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14.

                     </note> A man may not goe into the Fire, nor cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the Water, or goe meet a Lion or a Bear, because God hath determined how long we shall live. Christ would not tempt God, by casting himself down from the Pinnacle, as the Devil would have had him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.6, 7. As God hath ordained the end, so he hath ordained the means to bring us to that end; as God hath determined our dayes, so he hath determined that wee shall fly dangers, and hurtful things which may shorten our dayes. When <hi>Saul</hi> threw a Javelin at <hi>David</hi> he fled from him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.10. wee see men fly from Sword and Famine, and why not from the Pestilence when God gives us an opportunity?</p>
                  <p>Nature teacheth every Creature to preserve it self from danger, and if the Lord should reveal it to us, that we should be safe from the Plague, yet we must use the means. <hi>Noah</hi> knew he should not be drowned in the Floud, and yet hee builds an Ark; <hi>Paul</hi> knew that God would save him, and his Partners in the Ship, yet they must use the means, and row towards the shore, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.34, 38, 39, 40.</p>

Hee that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that I should not kill another, commands also that I should not kill my self. The Plagues of God are terrible, and not to be played withall. In the time of the Law we see how careful the Lord was of the safety of his people, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15.45. he commanded that the Leper should bee separated from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he sets down signs how they should know it, hee must wear a different garment, and must cry, <hi>I am unclean, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean</hi>; now if in the Leprosie which was a less infectious disease, and not deadly, such care was to be used, how much more in the Pestilence.</p>

How many Midwives, Physitians, and renders of infected persons, some of which have laine in the same bed with infected persons, yet being called by God to the service, have been preserved from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

                     <hi>Caution.</hi> Not that a Magistrate or Minister is bound in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to goe visit infected Persons, for then he makes himself uncapable of Publick imployment and the Ministers Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors will be afraid to come hear him; so that in this case the Publick good must be preferred before a private, and a greater good before a less.<note place="margin">

                     </note> That good man <hi>Bullinger</hi> going to visit one infected with the Plague, brought it home to his family, so that his Wife and two Daughters dyed of it. The Church of God, and our own Families, are to be preferred before any private person; Publick persons are set over a Society, and not over one or two. Hence when <hi>David</hi> would have gone out with his Souldiers to battle, the people answer, <hi>Thou shalt not goe, for thou art worth ten thousand of us,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.3. But private persons who are free, and have no publick tye by duty or charity to stay, they are free, and may for a time ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselves if they please.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Obj. <hi>I am a godly man, and God hath promised that such shall not dye of the plague,</hi> Psal. 91.10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> God hath no where promised an absolute freedome to his people from the Pestilence, but only conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> so farre as it shall be good for them; indeed he alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves his people from the evil of it, so that it shall never be a Plague, or a Curse, but a fatherly correction to them; and so the Promise is fulfilled. <hi>There shall no evil befall thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall the Plague come nigh thy dwelling, viz.</hi> as an evil or curse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.10. The evil is alwayes taken away from the godly, and the sting pulled out, and God makes it up to them in some better kind. By it he takes them away from greater evils, and makes the Pestilence like <hi>Elijahs</hi> fiery Chariot, to conveigh them more speedily to heaven. In respect of outward afflictions, all things come alike to all. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.2. the same Sythe cuts down good corn and weeds, but for a different end and purpose. We may not therefore censure them all as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men that are visited with the Plague, for God may try his dearest Servants in this kind. <hi>David, Iob, Hezekiah,</hi> and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are conceived to have been visited all in this

But now, <hi>thus will I doe unto thee, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Here is the <hi>Author</hi> of this subversion, viz. <hi>the Lord,</hi> I have overthrown some of you as God overthrew <hi>Sodom,</hi> q. d. As I overthrew <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> so have I overthrown your Cities. God speaks of himself according to the Hebrew Dialect in the third Person, setting forth thereby his Honour, and his power in this signal Judgement. The like expression we have, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.24. <hi>The Lord rained fire and brimstone upon Sodom from the Lord</hi>; that is, from himself. It is an Hebraism, when a Noun is put for a Pronoun, the more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically to express that it was not by Accident, or any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary course of Nature, but by the immediate and almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power of God, that such showers of Fire came upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Here is the dreadfulness of this subversion, it was like the destruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> As God made them examples of terrour to all the wicked in succeeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by consuming them with fire from Heaven (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Iude</hi> 7.) so the Lord brought those <hi>Israelites</hi> to the very brink of utter ruine and destruction.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wee read of no Cities in all the Scriptures, that ever the Lord destroyed with fire and brimstone immediately from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but only</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>upon whom he brought the saddest and most stupendious destruction that ever we read of; how then are these Cities said to be destroyed like them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is an Hyperbolical speech, frequently used in Scripture, to set forth the most terrible desolation, and dreadfullest devastation that can befall a People, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58817:53"/>
when the Holy Ghost would set forth the signal Wrath of God against a place, he tells us it was like the destruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> Thus it sets forth the destruction of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> Isa. 13.19. &amp; Jer. 50.40. and so of <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Zeph. 2.9. so that it is a Figurative speech, and must not be taken Literally,<note place="margin">

                  </note> but Allusively; <hi>Sodoms</hi> destruction is put for dreadful and extream desolation, and doth denote ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the measure of Gods displeasure, than the manner of the punishment, so <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Ier.</hi> 49.18. <hi>Hos.</hi> 11.18. <hi>Israel</hi> here was brought so low, and to such extreamity by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that their destruction seemed like that of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and those that escaped out of those great trials were so few, that they seemed like a brand pulled out of the fire. This seems to relate to that time when God raised up <hi>Hazael,</hi> and the <hi>Syrians,</hi> who smote <hi>Israel</hi> in all their Coasts, burnt their Cities, laid wast <hi>Gilead</hi> and <hi>Bashan,</hi> killed their young men, slew their Children, ript up their VVomen with Child, opprest them in their Estates and Persons, so that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like the dust by threshing, that is, very weak and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, their strong Holds were lost, and they had no Humane helper; they had but fifty Horse-men left, and ten Chariots, and ten thousand Foot, a poor Guard for a Kingdome. To so low an ebbe were they brought, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.32, 33. &amp; 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.3.7, 20, 22. &amp; 14.26.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Here is Gods mercy to <hi>Israel,</hi> set forth by a kind of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or mitigation; yee were indeed like <hi>Sodome,</hi> yet not altogether like <hi>Sodome,</hi> for all their Cities were burnt and none escaped; but the Lord hath spared your Metropolis, and chief City <hi>Samaria, and pulled some of you as a brand out of the fire,</hi> q. d. when you were in a very low and lost condition, being like a peece of Timber half burnt, yet then had I pitty on you, and remembred my Covenant, and rescued you out of your present misery by the hand of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the second, the Son of <hi>Ioash,</hi> even as a brand out of the flame, and saved a remnant of you from the sword (2 <hi>King.</hi> 14.25.) To pull one as a brand out of the fire is a Proverbial speech,<note place="margin">

               <p>The sum of all is this, <hi>That I might leave no means unassay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (saith the Lord) to reclaim you, I have added this to all the rest of my Iudgements, that I have overthrown some of your Cities, and brought you so low, that you were almost like</hi> Sodome <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>and you of</hi> Samaria <hi>were left out of the common destruction, as a brand taken out of the sire, yet all this hath not moved you to return unto me, saith the Lord.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1 <hi>If the Word of God work not upon mens hearts, neither will Iudgements work upon them.</hi> These people had <hi>Elijah, Elisha, Ionah, Ioel, Micah, Hosea, Amos,</hi> to preach to them, but their Ministery was ineffectual, and now wee see that no Judgement can work upon them. Those that are <hi>Sermon-proof,</hi> and will not beleeve the Word of God, will quickly be <hi>Iudgement-proof,</hi> and contemn Gods Sword. Those that have <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and yet will not beleeve them, neither will they beleeve though one should arise from the dead, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> If a man should come roaring from Hell, it would affright men, but it is easier to fright men out of their wits, than out of their sins. <hi>Lazarus</hi> rose from the dead, yet the Pharisees were so farre from being bettered thereby, that they grew madder against Christ. So at the Resurrection of Christ, many arose, and appeared to many, and no doubt but they told them, how it was with those that were dead, and yet it could not work upon them. He that cavils at the Word, will also cavil at Miracles, as the Pharisees did at the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Christ.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Qui adeò in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duratus est, ut Scripturae non credat, nec mortuis resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentibus credet Stella.</hi>
                     </note> He that will not beleeve the Spirit of God speaking in the Prophets, will not beleeve a man pretending that he came from the Dead, and telling what the Damned suffer there. How should he beleeve a Creature, that will not beleeve the infallible testimony of his Creator?</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures are a surer ground for us to build upon, than an Angels voyce (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.) No revelations are to be compared to them, God will never set in with wayes of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58817:54"/>
mens invention, when they despise the waies of his own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. The blind world which is weary of true Doctrine, is apt to think, that if an Angel from Heaven, of a Ghost from Hell would come and teach them, then they should bee converted. These are like <hi>Saul,</hi> who contemned the counsel of <hi>Samuel</hi> living, yet desired to speak with him when he was dead. But, 1. why doe you not beleeve Christ who dyed, and is risen from the dead, and speaks daily to you by his Ministers? 2. Why doe you not beleeve the Prophets, who being dead yet speak to you, and have left us a more sure word of Prophesie? 3. Suppose one should come from Hell all in flames, and tell you what the Damned suffer there, yet how is it probable that this should doe you good, when God tells you the same thing in his Word, and yet you will not beleeve him? It is most certain, that those who despise Gods Ordinance, will never beleeve a report from a doubtful and erring authority. Desire not therefore Miracles, or Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Enthusiasms, this is a tempting of God; but suffer God to teach thee in his own way, by his Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; so did <note n="*" place="margin">

The conversion of a Sinner is not so much from the excellency of the means, or the abilities of the Speaker, as from the power of Gods Grace, which teacheth us to profit, and maketh the means effectual to us.

                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:58817:56"/>1 The Illative Particle, or the note of Inference, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>; The Lord draws a conclusion against them from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Premises, <hi>q. d.</hi> since none of my former Judgements will reclaime you, I am now resolved, that you shall reap the fruit of your disobedience, you shall no longer be my People, but I will cast you out of Covenant, and send you into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Land; so that yee shall not only lose your Land, but your Religion too; not only your Soyl but your Souls to boot; not only your goods but your God. I have sent out my Foot-men (saith God) and you have contemned them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with them; I will now see, what you will doe with Horse-men (<hi>Ier.</hi> 12.5.)

He doth not tell them how, or in what kind he will punish them, but leaves them to imagine the worst, thereby intimating that he would bring upon them sadder evils than they could imagine. <hi>Thus</hi> terribly, <hi>thus</hi> severely, in a more furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner than formerly, wil I deal with thee.

                  </note> full of clemency and consolation, telling them that he is yet their God in Covenant, ready to receive them, if they will but truly repent, and come in unto him; and therefore he counsels them speedily to prepare (for where no time is exprest, there, as the Debt, say Lawyers, so the Duty, say Divines, is presently to bee performed) to meet him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 21.12. return and come, but when? why present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is implied. So here, <hi>prepare to meet thy God</hi>; but when? why presently, before the decree bring forth, and it be too late, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 21.2. The Lord having told them what he would doe to them, now (such is his goodness) that hee shewes them what they should doe, to prevent his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>viz.</hi> prepare to meet him. Since he was ready to cast them off, he adviseth them to cast themselves down, and to implore his mercy, and make peace with him.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But what is meant by preparing to meet God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> To meet one hath various meanings in Scripture; 1. Sometimes we goe to meet Persons, that we may honour them, thus <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> went to meet the Angels, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.1. 2 Sometimes we goe to meet Persons, that we may scoff and jear at them, as <hi>Michal</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Saul</hi> did <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.20. 3 Sometimes we goe to meet Persons to fight with them, as <hi>David</hi> did with <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 Sam. 17.48. And thus some take the words in the Text for an Ironical taunting speech, as if the Lord had said, Since I am coming against thee, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your selves to meet me,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Te pares ad sustinendum impetum irae meae; aut ut occurras mihi vera resipiscentia &amp; emendatione. Drusias.</hi>
                  </note> and see if yee bee able to encounter me, and keep me back, who am coming against you as an enemy; come on, and meet mee with your hardned hearts, muster up your Armies, recollect your Forces, call in to your ayde all your Creature-confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58817:57"/>
and see if they can deliver you from my hand, and save you from my wrath, which is even ready to seize upon you. But this sense is very harsh, and contrary to the scope of the place; for all along the Lord calls upon them, not to stand out against him, but to submit unto him, and therefore he so oft complaines, even five times, <hi>Yet have yee not returned unto me, saith the Lord.</hi> Besides, there is no meeting of God with Armes and Armies, or any warlike Forces; what can all the hosts in the world doe against the Lord of Hosts, or who ever hardned himself against him and prospered? <hi>Iob</hi> 9.4. let the Potsheards strive with the Potsheards of the earth, but woe be to him that striveth with his Maker.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Sometimes we goe out to meet Persons to humble our selves before them, and to submit to them, as <hi>Shimei</hi> did to <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 19.16. and thus it is in the text, <hi>Prepare to meet thy God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Praepara ut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voces Deum tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. Septuag. Syriac, Arabic. Vers.</hi>
                  </note> viz. by Prayers and tears, by humble supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and real humiliation for sin, by forsaking your Idols, and cleaving to Gods true Worship, and by amendment of your lives run to meet him, that you may prevent the execution of his wrath upon you, &amp;c. This is the most proper meeting of God which is here called for, this is the genuine and true scope of the place; for the words are not a challenge, Come out and meet me; but a precious <hi>direction,</hi> shewing us what we must doe to appease and pacifie God, <hi>viz.</hi> not meet him in a way of <hi>Opposition</hi> and rebellion, for this were to set Bryers and Thorns in battle against a consuming fire (<hi>Isa.</hi> 27.4.) but meet him in a way of <hi>submission,</hi> as <hi>Abigail</hi> met <hi>David,</hi> when he was coming to destory <hi>Nabal</hi> and his house, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32. So here, since the Lord hath taken up this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to punish thee, O <hi>Israel,</hi> and is resolved to bring some greater Judgement on thee, therefore prepare thy self (saith the Prophet) by unfeigned humiliation and repentance,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Carrat poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia, ne prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currat senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia. Chrysologus.</hi>
                  </note> that so thou maist prevent the execution of the sentence. Put on thy mourning weeds, take up a lamentation, make ready thy Petition, goe forth upon thy knee, and beseech him to spare thee, that so thou maist prevent thy utter destruction which is now at hand.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But why doth the Lord call upon his people to prepare themselves, when their hearts were hardned, and he tells us that the way of man is not in himself, and that the preparation of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58817:57"/>
the heart is his work, and not ours.</hi> (Psal. 10.17.) <hi>Besides, he had decreed here to carry them into captivity, and hee tells them as much, and therefore all their repentance was but vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Lord had some elect and hidden ones both called, and to be called amongst them, and to these he prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally speaks; for all Gods commands are effectual in beleevers: they are not an empty sound, as they are in the ears of unbeleevers, but there goes forth a power from god inable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to obey; if he command them to beleeve, hee ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them so to doe. If he command them to prepare to meet him by repentance, there goes forth a power from him which inables them so to doe. As when our Saviour comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Lazarus</hi> to arise, there went forth a power from him that raised him, <hi>Moti movemus, acti agimus,</hi> when the will is regenerate and made pliable, then it readily obeyes all Gods commands, be they never so hard or harsh to flesh and bloud; yet they can doe all things Evangelically through Christ that strengthens them. God gives them his preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, assisting, co-operating, persevering grace, <hi>Iob</hi> 11.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Such commands as these shew us our duty, not our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and must make us in the sense of our own inability, prepare our selves to sue unto him for preparation.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Such commands make the wicked more inexcusable, who had power in <hi>Adam</hi> to obey all Gods commands, but they in him have lost it, and by their daily obstinacy, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from God, and his wayes, they have justified that grand Apostasie of our first Parents.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The threatnings of God are not alwayes absolute and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable,<note place="margin">See more in Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> on Job 23.13. p. 436.</note> but for the most part they are conditional, and to be understood with this exception, <hi>viz.</hi> except they repent and amend; and this condition is sometimes expressed, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.7, 8. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.13, 14. and sometimes suppressed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, as <hi>Ionah</hi> 3.9. <hi>Yet forty dayes and Niniveh shall bee destroyed</hi>; that is, if they repented not. So here, though <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> case seemed desperate, yet the Lord bids them turn, and he would be propitious to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Admit the Judgement be irrevocable, and Gods people must notwithstanding their repentance, bee Captives to the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58817:58"/>
                  <hi>Assyrians,</hi> yet their repentance had not been fruitless, for they should have escaped eternal misery.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In this Life, the punishment of such Penitents is oft mitigated, though not totally removed. Hence we usually see, that in times of publick Calamity it goeth best with the best men; to them these are but fatherly Chastisements, when to the wicked they are fore-runners of greater wrath. A <hi>Ieremy, Ezekiel, Daniel</hi> may goe into Captivity, but it is for good, as the Lord said sometimes of his People, I will send them into the Land of <hi>Caldea</hi> for good, <hi>Ier.</hi> 24.5. such mourners shall be marked for Mercy when Judgement comes. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Here are the <hi>Persons,</hi> to whom this Exhortation is applied and directed, and that is, to the ten Tribes, who are often called by the name of <hi>Israel,</hi> as being his off-spring, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.32. hee names them twice, and ingeminates the title, the better to awaken them, and quicken their attention, as also to shew his great affection to them, as <hi>David</hi> named <hi>Absolon</hi> twice, whom he loved. So our Saviour speaking to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> doubles the title, <hi>O Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, Ierusalem,</hi> Mat. 23.37. to awaken them, to shew his tender love and compassion to them, and to shew his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against their sins, he Pathetically cries out, <hi>O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, which killest the Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> q. d. <hi>Thou that hast been the place which God hath honoured with his special presence, and chosen above all the places of the earth for his habitation, to fix his name there, art thou become a den of Devils and Murderers?</hi> So the Lord here, the better to rouze these <hi>Israelites</hi> out of their security and impenitency, by an Epanodos, doubles their name, saying, <hi>Thus will I doe to thee, O Israel, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I will doe thus unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Since we are backward and averse to this duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, he backs his Exhortation with a double Motive.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The first is a <hi>drawing Motive,</hi> taken from the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods readiness to pardon Penitents. Hee <hi>is thy God,</hi> prepare to meet thy God; hee is thine by Profession, though thou hast walkt unanswerably to it. And 2. he is <hi>Thy God</hi> in Covenant with thee, and so ready to receive thee, if thou wilt but truly turn to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:58817:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>The second is a <hi>driving Motive,</hi> and is drawn from the consideration of Gods Almighty Power (<hi>vers.</hi> 13.) who was now marching against them. This power (the better to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them) he sets forth by six Royalties.</p>

Prayer is as it were the Midwife to bring great Blessings into the world, and remove great Judgements from us; and therefore when the Lord would destroy a people, he commands his <hi>Ieremies</hi> to forbear praying for them, they must not meet him in this kind to mediate or intercede for them, (<hi>Ier.</hi> 7.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.11.) thereby implying, that he cannot deny the Prayers of his people.</p>

So let us put ropes about our necks, as signs of our acknowledgement, that we are worthy of death; and the rather, because the God of Heaven is a merciful God, (1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.31.) Rising and raging at Gods Chastisements like a wilde Bull in a net, when men are full of the fury of the Lord (<hi>Esay</hi> 51.20.) this is the way to provoke God, to goe on in wrath against us, and to double his strokes upon us, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.24. If a Potent Prince should raise a great Army against us, and we had no strength to oppose his strength, the only way is to meet him with humble, submissive Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and so make peace with him. So, when ever we find, that the great God is angry with us for our sins, let us lay down the weapons of our rebellion; submit unto him; judge our selves, and then he will not judge us; accuse our selves, and he will acquit us; be sharp, and severe with our selves, and he will be merciful to us; let us accept of the punishment of our iniquity, and justifie him, in all that he hath done unto us, and then we have his promise for pardon, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.40, 41, 42. wee know, it is not for Gods honour to trample upon worms. The Lion will not seize on a yeelding Prey, the Maftiff will not fall on the little Dogge, that lyes on its back, turns up all four, and cries quarter. The bending Reed is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, when the stubborn Oke is pluckt up by the roots. It is the proud and haughty, whom God resists; he sets himself in Battle array against them, and delights to manifest his power in their subversion, <hi>Esay</hi> 2.12. to 18. But the humble are his habitation and delight. Let us therefore meet him sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively, considering wee are not a match for him. Sinful Nations are too weak for God, how much more are single Persons, <hi>Esay</hi> 40.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.22. It is God, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns Kings and Kingdoms at his pleasure, hee hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown Kingdoms that stood like firme Rocks.

Love is our best affection, and therefore most fit for God who is our best friend.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Hatred of Sin.</hi> There are two Affections especially which set themselves against sin, which are, Hatred and Grief. Hatred respects the nature of sin, and Grief respects the nearness of sin. If we had no sin we should hate it, but if it were not near us, we should not grieve for it. There are many, that hate sin but never grieve for it, but we must meet God with both these affections in us; wee must hate sin as to its owne nature, and grieve for it as it is our owne sin, and as we offend God thereby; and this is to meet God with grace in our hearts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 We must meet God <hi>with Christ in our armes.</hi> There is no seeing his face, unless we bring this our elder brother with us. God is holy, and we are unholy, so that he will not treat with us without Christ, nor can wee think of God out of Christ, but with extream horrour; besides, God will have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for sin past, before he treat for the time to come; now Christ is our Atonement, and our Mediator, and wee can expect no good from God without him, therefore let us meet him with Christ in our armes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 We must meet God with true <hi>Repentance.</hi> Sorrow befits a Sinner, as a garment doth the body. The garment of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance was made for sinners. Had we never sinned, we had never sorrowed. Repentance is Gods delight, it is his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, which he comes down from Heaven to salute and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, <hi>Esay</hi> 57.15. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20. Sin armes God against us, but repentance disarmes him; he cannot with-hold Mercies
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58817:61"/>
from the penitent, his promise hath given repentance power to prevail with him, it is the way of his owne prescribing, when he would have his people to find mercy in his eyes, hee bids them take this course, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 55.7. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. <hi>ult. Ezek.</hi> 18.31, 32. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.8, 9, 10. This is a never failing remedy, it alwaies obtaines either the blessing sought for, or some better thing; as we see in <hi>Manasses,</hi> the <hi>Ninivites, Mary Magdalen,</hi> the <hi>Prodigal, Paul,</hi> the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> Judg. 10.15, 16.</p>
                  <p>Yea, the very shadow of repentance can doe something for the removal of a temporal Judgement; as we see in <hi>Ahabs</hi> hypocritical humiliation, and <hi>Rehoboams,</hi> 2 Chron. 12.6, 7. The <hi>Israelites</hi> that cried unto the Lord only in their trouble, yet were delivered out of their distress; and if the shadow can doe so much, what will not the substance doe? Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance qualifies the soul, and fits it for Mercies Temporal, and Spiritual. It makes the heart soft, tender, flexible, and ready to receive any impression from God, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.6. This is that <hi>Panacea,</hi> that <hi>Catholicon,</hi> that Universal remedy against all maladies, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.7, 8. These tears and waters of repentance are very medicinal, and can prevail with God, when no others can, to extinguish the fire of his wrath, which is now gone forth against us. <hi>England</hi> is now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her <hi>Sick-bed,</hi> and we have great cause to fear, that shee is upon her <hi>Death-bed,</hi> and will scarcely recover; wee shall shortly see whether she will live or dye, her critical hour is now at hand, and we may justly suspect her death; and that because God hath cast his dealings with us into so many moulds and forms, and tried us every way, and yet we do not prepare to meet him. God hath been pleading with <hi>England,</hi> this hundred years by his <hi>Word,</hi> for his Worship, for his Day, for his Discipline, and for the power of godliness, and yet we have not prepared to meet him.</p>

hear it; it is a sign that we are either deaf, or dead. God hath spoken to us with anger in his countenance, and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his voyce, will yee still prophane my Holy things? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in your formality? and goe on in your rebellion against me? and yet we turn the deaf eare to him, hating to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And now when we thought all Gods Judgements were buried, and the memory of them was almost obliterated, yet they seeme to revive, and to be raised out of their Graves again. We are now dying and know it not, gray hairs are here and there upon us, and we take no notice of it (<hi>Hos.</hi> 7.9.) God cries to us by his Judgements, <hi>To day if yee will hear his voyce, harden not your hearts</hi>; while it is called to day make your peace with mee, before the night of warre, dearth, and death surprize you. God hath set forth a <hi>Third Edition</hi> of Warre, he hath printed his Wrath in Capital let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, his Spurs stick deep in our sides, and our lashes are heard over all parts of Christendome; and yet how little are we affected therewith, and how careless are we to prepare to meet the Lord. With what a horrid stupidity are wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed? the Plague of <hi>Lots</hi> Wife hath fallen upon us, and we are turned into Stones and Pillars; so that as our Saviour wept over <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> so should we weep over <hi>England</hi> for its induration, and not knowing the day of her Visitation. There is a dark and dismal cloud of wrath hangs over our heads; there is but one way left to prevent its falling on us, and that is, 1. <hi>Personal Repentance,</hi> every one to amend one. 2. <hi>Domestical Repentance,</hi> every Family apart must humble themselves for their family sins, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.12. 3. <hi>National Repentance,</hi> when the Magistrate shall command the whole Nation to humble themselves, for the crying sins, and great provocations, which have been daily committed in the midst of us. Till this be done, I shall never expect that truth or peace should abide long amongst us. Let us then every one fall heartily to this work, which must of necessity be done, or else we are undone, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5. let us humble our selves, and then God will raise us up, <hi>Iob</hi> 22.29. <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.10. Let us weep now, and we shall have joy when troubles come, <hi>Iob</hi> 5.22. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.16. Our sins are the <hi>Achans</hi> which have troubled our <hi>Israel</hi>; our sins are the <hi>Ionahs</hi> which have raised these storms and tempests amongst us; our sins are
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58817:62"/>
the <hi>Sheba's</hi> that have raised rebellion in the Land, it is our malignant sins, which have raised up against us malignant ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; let us then stone these <hi>Achans,</hi> and our troubles will cease; drown these <hi>Ionahs,</hi> and our storms will over; cut off the heads of these <hi>Sheba's,</hi> and our troubles will end; let us destroy our malignant sins, and God will soon destroy our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant enemies. If men would but judge themselves, they should not be judged of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. Let us then set upon this Soul-inriching-work of <hi>Self-examination,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See this Point excellently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, by Mr. <hi>Ant. Burgess,</hi> in his Treatise of Self-judging</note> 
                     <hi>and Self-judging.</hi> Let us arraign our selves, and set our selves as in Gods presence, before his bar. Let us examine, and take a view of our selves, in the Glass of Gods Law, and when wee have found out our corruptions, let us with shame and sorrow confess them, and spread them before the Lord, to move him to shew pitty to us. Let us judge our selves worthy to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed for them, humbly imploring pardon, in the name and mediation of Jesus Christ. Doe but this soundly, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and it will qualifie thee, for mercies Temporal, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and Eternal; and give thee title and interest in many gracious Promises; as <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.40, 41, 42. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.9. The Lord is now upon his march against us, it is time therefore for us to meet him with our Prayers, and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie him with our Tears, considering our own inability to grapple with him; Can dust and ashes contend with the God of Heaven and Earth? Can we with ten thousand Lusts, meet the Lord with twenty thousand of Angels? Can impotency vie with Omnipotency? O no.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Consider, we cannot run from God (<hi>Psal.</hi> 139.7. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> 9.2, 3.) we can goe no where from God, but we must fall into his hands. Let us therefore run from him, to him, <hi>Ab irato ad placitum,</hi> from him as an angry God, to him as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled Father. Bloud-letting is the cure of bleeding, and to close with an enemy is the way to avoyd the blow.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Consider, <hi>If we goe not to meet God, he will fetch us.</hi> He will either fill our souls with terrours, or else send outward afflictions to arrest us. When <hi>Ioab</hi> would not come to <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> he commands his field of Corn to bee fired, and then <hi>Ioab</hi> arose and came, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.30, 31. Physicians some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to cure the Lethargy, doe cast into a Feaver; so doth God, oft cure us of one evil by another. If the Word cannot,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58817:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Sword shall fetch us in, or else doe that which is worse, send us to Hell. Let us then learn to prevent blows; hearken to counsel and you may be safe, else rods are prepared for the backs of fools, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.3. If we come not in of our selves, let us expect some sad Messenger to fetch us; therefore while the sea is calm, and the weather fair, let us set out to meet our God. What the Lord said of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> is too true of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that he rendred not according to what he had received; so we are much behind hand with God, we receive much, but we return little; the Christian World is turned Bankrupt, and God is now issuing forth Process to seize upon Body, Goods, and Life. Hee cannot have what he would have, he will therefore have what he should have. He is now setting us as low, as we have hitherto set his love. Long-suffering is now at an end; God will have all paid now, or else Justice will set abroach our bloud. O <hi>England,</hi> then repent, and prepare to meet thy God; and to incourage us, know, that if wee will goe to meet God, he will come to meet us; he will meet our sorrow with his sense of it; our Prayers with his presence, and propitious answers; and our tears with his handkerchief. Nay, he will meet us with embraces, as the father of the Prodigal did his returning Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20. Let us then goe to him, with humble acknowledgements in our mouthes, and say to him, Father, we have sinned against Heaven, and before thee, we have abused thy Mercies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised thy Judgements, despited thy Spirit, and have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto thee. Let us thus in humility fall down at Gods feet, and he will fall on our necks, and embrace us in the armes of his love. Seeing therefore God will doe thus unto us, let us prepare our selves to meet our God.</p>

God made them out of the rude Mass, and confused Chaos of earth, when he gathered the Waters into one place, and the dry land appeared, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.9. and it is apparent, that the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were in being before <hi>Noahs</hi> Floud, for it is said, that <hi>all the high Mountains were covered with waters</hi> (Gen. 7.19.) they were then in being, before they are said to be fixed, and setled by God (<hi>Prov.</hi> 8.25.) and framed in weight and measure by him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.12. He hath made the Mountains strong and stable, high and unmoveable, for his own glory, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 148.5, 9.) and the good of Mankind. (<hi>Psal.</hi> 65.5.) By the Mountains the violence of the Winds are broken, and kept from hurting us, and so they are for <hi>Muniment.</hi> By them the Universe is adorned, and made more glorious and wonderful, and so they are for <hi>Ornament.</hi> By them the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are kept warm, and inriched, by them they are watered
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58817:64"/>
with Springs, and showers that run down from them (<hi>Iob</hi> 24.8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.10.) To them men run for shelter and defence in times of trouble, <hi>Psal.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.38. By them Cities are defended under God, against their enemies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 125.2. upon them growes Grass for the sheep, and beasts of the field, and here they feed, <hi>Iob</hi> 39.8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 148.9. <hi>Isa.</hi> 18.6. Here many Treasures of Mettals and Minerals, of Lead, Iron, Brass, Stone, Silver, Gold, &amp;c. are hid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.9.</p>
               <p>This should make us, 1. <hi>Love</hi> the Lord, who hath so curiously formed, and framed the Universe for the good of man.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It should make us <hi>fear</hi> to offend him, who by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power hath created these mighty, massie Mountains, and before whom they tremble, and melt like Wax. These obey God, and praise him in their kind (<hi>Isa.</hi> 44.23.) and if the Lord of these Mountains be against us, no Mountaine can fence or shelter us, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.20. A due apprehension of Gods Majesty, will make us perform all our Duties with fear and reverence, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29. We should take shame to our selves, for our hardness of heart, and great insensibleness, when we consider, how the Mountains, and inanimate Creatures tremble at his presence; how much more when he is <hi>angry</hi>; and if these be overthrown by God in his anger, <hi>Iob.</hi> 9.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.9. much more shall wicked men, those metaphorical Mountains, which exalt themselves against God, and his wayes, bee overturned by him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64.1. <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Hee createth the Wind.</hi> This is the second Prerogative Royal of the great God. By creating the Mountains and the Wind, two mighty things (under which Synecdochically are comprehended the other Works of God) the Prophet sets forth Gods Omnipotency, for it would have been too much to have enumerated all the rest of God glorious VVorks, and therefore he pitcheth on some chief ones, and leaves us to conclude of the rest. Before he had spoken of the creating of the Mountains, now he comes to speak of the VVinds, which arise (as some conceive) out of those Mountains. These two differ in nature, for the one is gross and unmoveable, but the VVinds are of an airie, thin substance, which cannot be seen;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58817:65"/>
and yet such is their power that they toss the Seas, overthrow the strongest Trees, cast down Houses, yea and overturne Mountains, when these VVinds are shut up in their bowels. The word <hi>Ruach</hi> is <hi>Homonymous,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p n="1">1 Some read it thus, he createth the Soul or <hi>Spirit. Calvin</hi> conceives that the Prophet speaks of the spirit of man, though he excludes not the VVind, and his reason is because of that which follows, <hi>viz. The shewing to man his thoughts.</hi> But if this way of reasoning were valid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ab ordine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum nulla est argumentatio.</hi>
                  </note> we may better say <hi>(Salva semper reverentia tanto viro dignissima)</hi> that he speaks of the Natural VVinds, because immediately before he spake of the Mountains, from whence Philosophers conceive that these VVinds proceed, and the word <hi>Ruach</hi> is oft put for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural VVinds; as <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.13, 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.10. <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Caryl</hi> on Job 28.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 28.25.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The <hi>Socinians</hi> and their followers take this word for a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that Spirit to be the Holy Ghost; this they doe to destroy the Deity of the Holy Ghost. See here what windy, idle, addle conceits Hereticks have, and what feeble, sandy foundations they build upon; they catch at any chrotchet which may please their humours: For it is plaine here that the Prophet speaks of the created VVind, or if they will needs read it Spirit, yet it is a created Spirit, <hi>Hee createth Ruach the Wind, or the Spirit.</hi> But the Holy Ghost is not made or Created, but proceedeth from the Father, and the Son, and is <hi>God blessed for ever</hi>; as is <note n="*" place="margin">See D. <hi>Chey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> on the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, chap. 4. p. 31.

               <p>As for the Natural causes of the VVind, Philosophers dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; Some conceive that the Sun drawing up Vapours and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, and they falling down again by violence, become Winds by the coldness of the middle region.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Others conceive, that the aire being pent up in the Vaults and Caves of the earth, having a vent doe break forth,

But God himself, who hath made the Wind, tells us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we know not whence it comes, nor whither it goes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.7. we may therefore well be ignorant of that, which God in his wisdome hath hidden from us. An humble igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in deep Mysteries, whether Natural, or Supernatural; whether in the works, or the Word of God, is better and safer than proud curiosity.</p>
               <p>VVe have many Reasons to bless God for the <hi>Wind.</hi> It is indeed a common Blessing, but yet we could not live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 If the Aire be thick, dark, and unwholsome, the VVind cleareth and <hi>purgeth the aire</hi> for the health of our Bodies, and for the preservation of the Creatures. They dispel noysome Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and therefore are called <hi>Scopae mundi,</hi> the worlds Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms, with which God sweeps his great House, the world.</item>
                  <item>2 If we want <hi>Rain,</hi> the Winds carry the Clouds, and bring us rain; at the Prayers of <hi>Elijah,</hi> after three years drought, the Heavens were darkned with Clouds and Wind, whence came a great rain, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.45.</item>
                  <item>3 They <hi>cool the Aire</hi> in the heat of Summer, and help to refresh us.</item>
                  <item>4 They help our <hi>Ships to sayl,</hi> and bring Commodities from all Nations to us; and help our Mills to grind our Corn.</item>
                  <item>5 They serve for the <hi>Miraculous help</hi> of Gods Church and People. When the Lord had brought <hi>Israel</hi> by a strong hand out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> hee caused the Sea to goe back by a strong East-wind, and made the Sea dry land for his people to pass thorough, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.21.</item>

Ascribe not then great VVinds to Conjurers, Witches, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, &amp;c.

               </list>
               <p n="3">3 This is not all, for the Prophet descends to man, and tells us, that since God made him, he also can <hi>tell him his thoughts,</hi> meditations, and purposes. He can tell what Language men have in their hearts, and what they talk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themselves, as the rich fool did, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.17. Our words are not so intelligible to men, as our thoughts are to God. Christ knew what was in man, hee knew their thoughts (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> and therefore he answered his enemies many times, not according to their words, but according to their thoughts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.20. yea God knows our thoughts before we think them, and our conceits before we conceive them, hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands them afarre off, <hi>Psal</hi> 139.2. he being <hi>intimo nostro intimior,</hi> nearer to us than our flesh is to our bones; hee knowes our thoughts <hi>in Posse</hi> from all eternity; so great is his Omniscience! As a man that knoweth what Roots he hath in his Garden, though there be no flower appearing, yet he can say, when the Spring comes, this and this will come up. So it is here, God knowes our frames, our Principles, our Projects, and what the issue will be, nothing is hid from his All-seeing eye. The words are diversly read.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Some refer the <hi>Affix</hi> to God, thus, Hee declareth to man his owne mind and meditation, and tells him what hee intends to doe (<hi>Esay</hi> 41.26. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.7.) thus he revealed his mind to <hi>Abraham</hi> before hee would destroy <hi>Sodome,</hi> and Christ reveals his secrets to his Disciples, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Septuagint mistaking the Original, read it thus,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58817:66"/>
He declareth unto man his Christ, <hi>Meshicho, Christum, vel Unctum suum</hi>; but the word is <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Quid sit cogitatio vel meditatio sua, vel eloquium suum, nam Suach est secum cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, vel secum colloqui. Sanctius.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Masecho,</hi> what is his thought. But the proper scope of the Text, is to convince the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> that they had not to doe with men, but with the Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent God, who searcheth the heart, and trieth the reins, and knoweth the hidden things of man, even the most secret turnings and windings, ploddings and purposes of the Soul, so as he cannot be deceived, neither will he be mocked. A man may know much by himself, but God knowes more; our Consciences may accuse us of some things, but God is greater than our Consciences, and knoweth all things.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But how doth God declare unto man his Thoughts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Divers wayes. 1. Sometimes he discovers and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoints the most secret aymes, and intentions of men, and so makes their thoughts visible to the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2 By his Ministers, they opening the Word of God, which is a Soul-searching Word, doe discover to men the thoughts, and intents of their hearts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Sometimes without the Word, God by his Spirit checks men, and convinceth the Conscience of the vanity, and sinful imaginations which are in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He maketh the morning darkness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prophet goes on still to shew the Almighty Power of God, who can turn the brightest morning into dreadful dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the most glorious day into a dismal night. If he be angry:<note place="margin">How the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract doth augment the signification, see my Schools Guard. Rule 36.</note> he can make the morning not only dark, but <hi>darkness</hi> it self in the Abstract; that is, exceeding dark.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Others read the words thus, <hi>He maketh the morning and the darkness</hi>; that is, he maketh both Day and Night. God shews his Power, not only in creating the World, but also in gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the whole course of Nature continually, exactly order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Vicissitude and change of Day and Night. It is he that makes the Light and the Darkness, in the morning he makes the light to arise out of darkness; and in the evening he makes the darkness to follow the light. This sense is good. But the first I look upon as most genuine from the text.</p>

The Lord trieth the heart, as the furnace trieth the gold; when Mettals come to bee put into the Furnace, there is a great deal of dross in them, so that the Mettal sometimes can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be discerned by the Artificer, till the Furnace hath separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the dross from the mettal; so the All-seeing eye of God, which is compared to a flaming fire (<hi>Revel.</hi> 1.14.) search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and separateth good from evil.

will not acknowledge this, <hi>Psal.</hi> 94.8, 9, 10, 11. Every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer knowes best the thing that he hath made; a man that makes a Watch, knowes every wheel of the Watch, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pin, which another cannot discern. Known to God are all his Works, <hi>Acts.</hi> 15.18. but the chief of Gods Works is Man, and therefore mans heart must needs be known to him: and if the spirit of man knowes what is in man (<hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11.) then God who hath made that spirit must much more know what is in man, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.24, 25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 He takes the wise in their owne Plots, which hee could not doe if he did not know their hearts, <hi>Iob</hi> 5.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19. Of all men God delights to befool the grand <hi>Polititians</hi> of the World; he takes them in their owne traps; and blowes them up, as it were with their own Gun-powder. As a man that will goe beyond a man in discourse, hee must know the Arguments which he will bring, that so hee may bring other Arguments beyond them; so God out-shoots the <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phels</hi> of the World in their owne bow. <hi>Haman</hi> was a subtile man, and thought he had made all sure, but we know how the Lord turned his Plot upon his owne pate. In the thing wherein he dealt subtilly, and proudly, the Lord was above him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.11. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a subtile Persecutor, yet see how God takes him in his owne Net, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.10. hee would work wisely, and will kill all the Male-Children of the Hebrews, yet see how God blasts his Project, for amongst them he saved <hi>Moses,</hi> yea <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter shall bring him up at Court, who shall be <hi>Pharaohs</hi> destruction. Many Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titians walk in the Clouds, as if the Lord should not see them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 94.7. but they must know, that the Lord is a God of knowledge, and all their actions are weighed by him, 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 2.3.</p>

How should he distribute Rewards and Punishments according to mens demerits, if he knew not the intents and thoughts of their hearts? If God did not search the heart, how many secret sins would goe unpunished, and many secret wrongs done to the godly and innocent man goe unrevenged? The Lord therefore searcheth the heart, that hee may

give to every one according to his works, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.3. <hi>The heart of the King is unsearchable, how then can God search the heart?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He speaks in respect of men, God useth many times to endue his Vice-gerents with such depth of wisdome, that it surpasseth the ordinary judgement of Subjects to finde them out; but it doth not surpass Gods knowledge. God could not turn Kings hearts if he knew them not, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.1. When we are to deal with a man whose disposition wee are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withall, we know not what Motives will perswade him; whereas if we have to deal with one that we know, then we know what Motives will perswade him; so the Lord that made the hearts of Kings, he knows how to perswade them, and win upon them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 This searching must not be taken properly, but figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; as for man he must search, and by discourse and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one thing to another, labour to finde out a matter; but it is not so with God, who is perfectly wise, and knowes every thing in it self without discoursing, God is all eye. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a mans whole body were an eye, he need not then to turn himself to see things, for he would see on every side; but he that hath but one eye must turn himself about to see things. But God who is all eye, and seeth into the nature of things, needs no turning about to discourse, and so to search out things as we doe; and therefore one said well, Things that are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after the manner of men, must be understood according to the Majesty of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 This Metaphor of searching, is taken, 1. Either from <hi>Students,</hi> who when they come to a hard point, they are put to a great deal of pains to search out the matter before they can know the depth of it. Or, 2. From <hi>Refiners,</hi> the Lord tries the heart (<hi>Prov.</hi> 17.3.) not only as a Load-stone, but like a Furnace to separate the gold from the dross; when God comes to search the heart of his Elect, he hath a power beyond all other refiners, for look what is good, hee makes it better, and what is nought hee takes away, and makes it good. He turns the vilest earth into the purest Gold, and the vilest Mettal, a proud heart, he turns into an humble heart. Hee casts a Christ-despising-soul into the Furnace, and it comes out a high-prizing soul of Christ.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> There is so great a difference between Creatures knowing of the hearts, and the Creators knowledge of them, that ours is nothing in comparison of his.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 They differ in respect of their <hi>Original</hi>; God knows the heart of himself, and needs not that any man should tell him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> But Angels and Men know by revelation from God, or revelation from others. Thus God revealed to <hi>Samuel,</hi> which was <hi>Saul,</hi> that should bee King of <hi>Israel,</hi> 1 Sam. 9.15, 17. Thus <hi>Elisha</hi> knew the covetousness of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazi,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> the Hipocrisie of <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira.</hi> Thus the good Angels know what is in us by Revelation, and the evil ones by the working of our fancies, they know what will take with us, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In respect of <hi>Certainty,</hi> we know things but conjectural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, darkly, and by halves; but God knoweth all things exactly, and perfectly; he knowes us better than wee know our selves. Christ knew <hi>Peters</hi> heart, when hee knew it not himself; and God knew <hi>Hazaels</hi> heart, when himself could not beleeve the wickedness which was there. Thus hee knowes our thoughts afarre off (<hi>Psal.</hi> 139.2.) men may see the thoughts of others near hand, when they begin to break out, and bewray themselves in the face and countenance, in gestures, words, and looks; by these we sometimes pump out what is in men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.5. But this is but conjectural, and we are oft deceived, as we see in <hi>David,</hi> he thought <hi>Absoloms</hi> purpose had been sincere, in going to fulfill his Vow at <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron,</hi> and that <hi>Achitophel</hi> had been a faithful Counsellor. Thus the Disciples took <hi>Iudas</hi> to be like themselves, and therefore when Christ said, <hi>One of you shall betray mee,</hi> every one asked, <hi>Master, is it I?</hi> But God did most certainly know <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soloms</hi> Hypocrisie, <hi>Achitophels</hi> Policy, and <hi>Iudas</hi> his Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In our thoughts there is the object which we think on, and the impress of it, as it lieth in our fancy; and this the Angels being Spirits may know, and see what is in the fancy. But now to make up a full thought, there must be an act that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58817:70"/>
on this object, that carrieth with it an Affirmative, or Negative, for an hundred men may think on one and the same object, and yet they may act diversly; now because the mind of man may work several ways on one and the same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the Angels cannot certainly know the hearts of men, which made the Devils Oracles to speak so ambiguously, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they knew not certainly what should come to pass. But God hath a clear and exact knowledge of all things, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knowes all the turnings and windings, all the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and thoughts of our hearts, whether good or bad, sudden or deliberate, past, present, or to come, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Iob</hi> 42.2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.21. He knowes our thoughts before we think them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.21. though men have fair words, yet hee knowes they have many times foul hearts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.28, 29. God takes notice of every wanton thought which is in our hearts, which made <hi>Iob</hi> (ch. 31.1.) to make a covenant with his eyes, that he might not so much as think on a Maid, least he should sin against God, and displease him, who takes notice of all the motions of our hearts. God took notice of <hi>Sauls murderous thoughts</hi> towards <hi>David,</hi> when he was playing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he thought to have murdered him; and of <hi>Felix</hi> his covetous thoughts, when he sent so oft for <hi>Paul,</hi> thinking that money should have been given him. But God in goodness to us, hath lockt up the hearts of men from the knowledge of men, for the preservation of Humane society, for man is a sociable Creature; now if there were a window made in the Soul of every man, to know what is in him, there would bee no living one by another, so vile and fierce we are by nature, (<hi>Titus</hi> 3.3.) every one hath several ends, and if we could see whose heart opposeth us in the pursuit of them, we should hate them. Besides, every man hath secret fins, which if all the world should know, we should be ashamed to look one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in the face, and afraid one of another.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Woe then to <hi>Quakers,</hi> who assume to themselves Gods Prerogative Royal, of knowing the heart, How oft have they told us, that they know mens hearts (when it may bee they know nor their names) so soon as ever they see their faces; they know who are Hypocrites, or prophane, at first-sight. But it is no wonder, that those who have printed that they are equal to God, as holy as God, as just as God, as good as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58817:71"/>
God; if they also say, they are as knowing as God. These high-flown Atheistical ones assume more to themselves, than the very glorified Saints or Angels dare doe.

                  <p n="2">2 This must <hi>humble</hi> us in all our approaches before this Omniscient, Heart-searching God. We have not to doe with men, but with the All-seeing God, who cannot, and will not be mocked. We are apt to think highly of our selves, but God knowes that by us which we know not by our selves. Wee know but in part, but he knowes us thorowly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if our Conscience doe accuse us of something, yet he is greater than our Conscience, and knoweth all things. Men may <hi>secretly</hi> and <hi>subtilly</hi> hide their sins from men, but nothing is hid from God, he sets our secret sins in the light of his countenance. It is dangerous to plot any thing either against him, or any thing which relates unto him; for as he sees mens sins, so hee hath power to punish them. Woe then to such as oppose Gods Truth, these oppose God, and rob his people of the choycest purchase. 2. Such as oppose his Embassadours doe oppose him, he accounts the indignities done to them as done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. 3. Such as abuse his people, and despise them for their purity, despise God who made them so.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It must make us serious and <hi>sincere</hi> in all that we doe, since we have to doe with a God that searcheth the heart, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the spirits of men, and if they be but a graine too light, his beam will soon discover it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.2. Did we but set the Lord alwaies before us, it would keep us from falling, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the right hand, or on the left, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.8. <hi>David</hi> kept all Gods Precepts, because he knew that all his wayes were before him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.168. So <hi>Iob</hi> 34.21, 22. There is much in the eye of men to keep us from sin, and quicken us to duty, how much more in Gods All-seeing eye, <hi>Iob</hi> 24.17. He looks upon Sinners with a Vindictive eye. It is said of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and some others, that they had such sparkling eyes that they terrified men, so that they durst not look upon them. This is most true of God in a Spiritual sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he but look on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Host, it puts them all into terror, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.24. yea if he but look upon the earth, which never sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it trembles before him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 97.4. Men may dissemble
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58817:71"/>
with men, but there is none can deceive God. No Sinner is more hated of God than the Hypocrite, because no sin is so directly opposite to his Nature. <hi>Iehu</hi> his zeal was, to settle himself in <hi>Ahabs</hi> Throne, but God sees through such Tiffany-designs, and sayes to such, as the Prophet said to the Wife of <hi>Ieroboam, Come in thou Wife of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>why feignest thou thy self to be another than thou art</hi>? God will one day smite such painted walls. <hi>Esau</hi> a cunning Hunter, may get the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison of this World, but it is plaine, sincere, single-hearted <hi>Iacob</hi> that gets the blessing. Let us therefore alwaies walk as in the presence of God, as <hi>Enoch</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24.) <hi>Abraham,</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1.) and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, <hi>Esay</hi> 38.3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 This should make us to keep a strict watch over out <hi>Thoughts.</hi> God is a Spirit, and he more especially eyes the bent of our spirits. It is not so much our words and workes, as our hearts which the Lord ponders. So that what the Apostle saith of our <hi>words,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">But of this at large, in my Comment. on 2 Tim. 3.2. p. 28, 29.</note> is most true of our <hi>Thoughts</hi>; he that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth not in thought, the same is a perfect man. He is right indeed, who is right within. When the Lord comes to search men, he ransacks the heart, and observes what imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and thoughts lodge there, and judgeth of men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It may inform us, that the holy Scriptures are the Word of God, because of that lively, powerful, heart-searching excellency that is in them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12, 13. Mens words are dead, but here is living water; sharp and quick, discovering the very thoughts and intents of the heart; wee should not then quarrel with the Word, when it nakedly discovers our selves unto our selves, but fall on our faces and worship God, confessing that he is in his Ministers of a truth (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25.) We must bless, and not blaspheam, as some that say, <hi>The Devil is in the Minister, he hath some Familiar, else how could he know my thoughts?</hi> when it is not we that know your thoughts, but it is God who searcheth your hearts, and by his Word doth discover the secrets of your hearts, though wee know not your faces. It is the Lord who directs the Word to the hearts of his people. <hi>Austin</hi> reports of himself that when he had been Preaching to his owne people, he fell from the subject he intended, to confute the <hi>Manichees.</hi> When hee came home, he said to those at dinner with him, Did you not

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter wee have the summe and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the fourth Sermon of the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> which contains a Lamentation for the Captivity, and utter desolation, which was coming upon the Kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> for their obstinacy and Idolatry.</p>
            <p>Where wee have 1 A short <hi>Exordium</hi> to quicken atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, verse 1. <hi>Hear this word which I take up against you.</hi>

            <p n="2">2 Here is a Commination and denouncing of Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against them. 1 More briefly, vers. 2, 3. 2 More amply and Rhetorically, vers. 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 27.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Here is a Catalogue of those enormities and crying sins which brought these Judgements upon them: As

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The summe of the Prophets Argument is this, <hi>That people which is unrighteous, obstinate, cruel, hypocritical and Idolatrous, shall perish; But such are you, O ye house of Israel: Therefore yee shall perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 Here is an exhortation to Repentance, repeated again and again, to make the deeper impression upon their hearts, that so they might prevent the Judgements approaching, and this is done partly for the Elects sake that they might not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with the wicked, and partly for the wickeds sake that they mighr bee left without excuse.</p>
            <p>Here wee have the two parts of Repentance. 1 The <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus à quo,</hi> from what they must turn, <hi>viz.</hi> from Idols which cannot help in a day of wrath, vers. 5. and from the evil of sin, which brings with it the evil of punishment, vers. 14, 15.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> to whom they must return, <hi>viz.</hi> to God, which is oft repeated to shew the great necessity of it, vers. 4, 6, 8, 14, 15, 24. Seek yee the Lord, seek goodness, seek righteousness.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Here are Motives to inforce the duty. The first is a <hi>drawing Motive</hi> taken from the benefit which attends Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>viz.</hi> life and salvation, vers. 4. <hi>Seek yee me, and yee shall live,</hi> and with all the gracious favour and presence of God, vers. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>The second is a <hi>driving Motive,</hi> drawn from the evil which will necessarily follow the neglect of it, God will bee to them a consuming fire, vers. 6. <hi>Seek yee the Lord, lest hee break forth like fire in the house of</hi> Joseph, <hi>and devour it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third Motive is drawn from Gods power, which is seen in the <hi>works of Creation.</hi> Hee maketh the seven Stars and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vers. 8.2 In his works of Providence, <hi>Hee strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong.</hi>

               <p>IN this Chapter the Lord goes on with his charge against <hi>Israel,</hi> and the Prophet as his Atturney-general doth man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the charge against them. Hee opens the case, shews them their sins, and Gods Judgements coming on them for those sins; yet withall puts them in a way to prevent them, by perswading them to reform the things amiss amongst them.</p>
               <p>In this first Verse the Prophet makes as it were an O yes, calling for silence and attention. <hi>Hear yee this word which I take up against you.</hi> Hee had called for audience twice before <hi>Amos</hi> 3.1. &amp; 4.1. but this people had stopt their ears, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their hearts, they were become Sermon-proof, and Judgement-proof, nothing could work upon them, yet the Prophet calls a third time, if by any means hee might work upon them.</p>
               <p>This Verse is as it were the Preface to the Sermon, and is set in the front to quicken attention; where we have, 1 The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be attended, and that is the word of the Lord published by the Prophet <hi>Amos.

               <p n="2">2 Here are the persons against whom this Sermon is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and that is the ten Tribes, here called, <hi>The house of Israel, q. d.</hi> I speak not against strangers, but against you, O house of <hi>Israel,</hi> and therefore it concerns you to attend.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Here is the nature of the Sermon, it is a <hi>Lamentation,</hi> or lamentable Prophesie of the utter destruction of <hi>Israel, q. d.

               <p>IN the precedent Verse the Prophet tells us of a <hi>Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> given him by God to publish against <hi>Israel.</hi> In this Verse he comes to tell us exegetically what it is, <hi>viz.</hi> the fatal and final overthrow of the whole Kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> set forth in emphatical termes, and variety of words to assure this unbeleeving people of the certainty of those Judgements which they should shortly feel. In the words wee have the summe of this Funeral <hi>Lamentation,</hi> or <hi>Samaria's Epitaph</hi>; The <hi>Virgin of Israel is fallen.</hi> Where wee have,
<list>
                     <item>1 A Judgement threatned, and that is a fall. <hi>Israel</hi> is fallen, <hi>viz.</hi> into the hands of the <hi>Assyrians.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 Here are the <hi>persons</hi> upon whom this judgement shall fall, and that is <hi>upon the Virgin of Israel,</hi> or the ten Tribes.</item>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Kingdomes and Cities are called <hi>Virgins</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on several accounts: As 1 when they flourish in riches and renown, and remain unconquered, and unaccustomed to any yoke of servitude;<note place="margin">

                  </note> now such in Scripture, though they bee Heathenish and Idolatrous, yet are called Virgins: As <hi>Tyre,</hi> Isa. 23.12. <hi>Babylon,</hi> Isa. 47.1. and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> Jer. 46.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In respect of their Effeminacy, Delicacy, and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness, priding themselves in their Beauty and Bravery,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58817:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and tricking themselves up like Virgins;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Israel vocatur Virgo, non prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intégrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, sed prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ornatum &amp; pulchritudinem. Estius in Loc. difficil.</hi>
                  </note> and thus <hi>Israel</hi> was effeminate, living daintily and deliciously, giving themselves up to feasting, mirth, and musick, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. priding themselves in their wealth, and ornaments, and in this respect they might be called Virgins.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In respect of their weakness, and unableness to help themselves; so <hi>Israel</hi> shall fall, and be like a poor, helpless, forlorn Virgin, that sits alone in distress without any helper; she shall now be deflowred, and wasted by the <hi>Assyrian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Israel</hi> is here called a Virgin after her Apostacy, but this is in relation to former times, before they were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, as in <hi>Davids</hi> time (before the division of the ten Tribes) when they served God in purity, without the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of humane inventions; and likewise in relation to their <hi>duty,</hi> shewing what they should have been, and not what now they were; and in this sense <hi>Iudah</hi> is also called a Virgin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Apostasie, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 31.21. they had both the name of Virgins, but were indeed Idolaters, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence Adulteresses, that broke the Covenant of their God.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The City of <hi>Samaria</hi> was a maiden City, it was never subdued or conquered by any Nation, before the <hi>Assyrian</hi> King <hi>Salmaneser</hi> brought it under the yoke of Servitude, and carried the ten Tribes captive into <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Media</hi>; and in this respect it might be called a Virgin.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Here is the <hi>certainty</hi> of this Judgement set forth in the Present Tense,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The Virgin of</hi> Israel <hi>is fallen</hi>; that is, shee shall as surely fall as if it were already done; and this is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with the Prophets, to signifie the certainty of a rhing, by putting it in the Present, or praeterit Tense.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen</hi>; that is, it shall suddenly sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and irrecoverably fall, <hi>Isa.</hi> 21.9. <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.2. So <hi>Iude</hi> 14. <hi>The Lord cometh,</hi> that is, he will as surely come, as if he were now coming to Judgement. This was about forty years before the final overthrow of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that the Prophet fore-told this; yet since God had decreed their fall, he tells them, it shall as surely be effected as if it were done this day; and it is usual with all the Prophets to speak thus assertively, not only because of the certainty of what his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58817:78"/>
denounced, but because from the first denuntiation the plague begins, though not discerned, nor sometimes accomplisht till many years after.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Here is the aggravation of her fall;
<list>
                     <item>1 She shall fall so that she shall never rise again.</item>
                     <item>2 She shall be forsaken in her own Land.</item>
                     <item>3 There shall be none to raise her up.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Many fall but they rise again, but when a Kingdome shall fall from its former splendor and dignity, and never be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again, that is very sad; yet this was <hi>Israels</hi> case, they were carried Captive into <hi>Assyria,</hi> and the body of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and generality of the People never returned again; nor had they ever the face of a Kingdom more, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.5. When the remainders of <hi>Iudah</hi> returned out of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> some few of <hi>Israel</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themselves with them, and are reckoned with <hi>Iudah,</hi> the rest of the ten Tribes being scattered, and dispersed up and down the world, degenerated into <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and some of those dispersed were converted in the Apostolical times, as appears by the inscriptions of the Epistles of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But we read in our Saviours time of the lost sheep of the house of</hi> Israel, <hi>Matth</hi> 10.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.24. <hi>and that</hi> Nicodemus <hi>was a Master in</hi> Israel, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.10. <hi>and therefore some conclude, that the Kingdom of</hi> Israel <hi>was not totally ruined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The word <hi>Israel</hi> hath many significations in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but that in <hi>Matthew</hi> hath relation to the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> for in Christs time there was no other Kingdome of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> extant but that, and that also was very low when Christ came, as I have shewed on <hi>Amos</hi> 9.11. and by a Master in <hi>Israel</hi> is meant no more but a Teacher in the Church of God, for the Church is oft called Israel, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115.12. <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.16.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>It was fore-told, that the ten Tribes should be made one with</hi> Judah, <hi>and should returne with them,</hi> Ezek. 37.16, 17, 19, 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is spoken of Gospel times, and implies a Spiritual, not a Corporal returning of a remnant of those despised and dispersed ones in the dayes of the Messiah, who should be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to <hi>Iudah,</hi> and by the preaching of the Gospel be brought into the unity of the Church.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:58817:78"/>Shee is forsaken upon her Land.</q>

                  </note> and now all desert and forsake her; she had laid Piety and Justice in the dust, and now God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to lay her in the dust, she shall be smitten to the earth, and dasht against it by the <hi>Assyrian</hi> with such force, that like an earthen pot it shall never be sodred together again.</p>
               <p>And which greatly aggravates their misery, all this should happen to them in their own Land, they should want men to help them in their owne Land, as appears in the next verse. They should be afflicted and brought low, not in an enemies Country, but even in their owne; they should be slaughtered and enslaved in the sight of their owne Country, which had been like a Mother and Nurse unto them, and was dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of them. It aggravates a Virgins misery, to be slaine in the sight of her owne Mother.</p>
               <q>There is none to raise her up.</q>
               <p>God will not, and then Creatures cannot. Shee shall fall without any help or hope of restauration, no neighbour Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall once reach out an helping hand to raise her out of the dust, but there let her lye, like one that is felled to the ground, and not able to rise of himself, and forsaken of all others must needs remaine as he fell; so <hi>Israel</hi> should never recover his pristine splendor, and flourishing condition, though some remnants should remaine, or as it followes in the next verse.</p>

every tenth man. But the Lord goes further here, being incensed against <hi>Israel,</hi> hee tells them, that by the Sword, by Captivity, by the Pestilence and Famine, hee would make such a slaughter amongst them, that the City which went out by a thousand, should bee brought to an hundred, and an hundred to ten; that is, of a great multitude very few should return. Such a woful decimation there should bee amongst them, that very few should escape. The like Threatning wee have set forth under another Metaphor, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.12. <hi>As the Shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the Lion, two legs, or the peece of an ear, so shall the children of</hi> Israel <hi>bee taken out of</hi> Samaria, <hi>&amp;c. q. d.</hi> as a Shepherd when a Lion hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring his flock, findes some mangled remains of a leg, or an ear; so shall it bee with <hi>Israel,</hi> some one or two shall escape the general slaughter and Captivity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The City that went out by a thousand</hi>; that is, The City which had a thousand Inhabitants passing to and fro through the gates thereof; or more genuinely, The City which sent forth a thousand able men to the Wars, or that could furnish, and set out a thousand men fit to bear Arms, shall have but an hundred left. The Prophet seems to allude to that of <hi>Moses,</hi> Deut. 1.15. where the people are divided under Captains over thousands, and Captains over hundreds.</p>
               <p>This Threatning was partly fulfilled in the three years siege of <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 King. 18.10. and partly after, when there was a great devastation of men amongst them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, To assure them of the reality and truth of all that hee had spoken; hee brings in the Lord asserting it, <hi>Thus saith the Lord God, q. d.</hi> You have not to do with impotent men, but with an Omnipotent God, who both can and will execute his judgements upon the heads of the wicked.</p>
               <p>The summe of all is this, <hi>So few shall bee left alive after the long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hard sieges of the Assyrians, that in those Cities of</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>out of which a thousand able men had wont to go forth to War, now there should be left but an hundred, and an hundred shall be brought to ten, saith the Lord who doth this.</hi>

that go out by thousands to return by hundreds, and reduceth their hundreds to tens. Wee use to complain of such as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people Towns and Villages; sin is the Arch-depopulation of Towns and Cities, it brings the Sword, Plague and Famine upon Nations, which sweep men away by thousands. As obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience multiplies a people, and makes them like the sand of the Sea for multitude, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.20. So disobedience makes men few in number, which were before as the Stars of heaven for multitude, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.62. We should therefore unanimously rise in arms against this Cut-throat sin; if an enemy should come to Town that had killed our fathers, mothers, wives and children, and robbed us of all our pleasant things, with what indignation and fury would men, women and children joyntly rise to ruine such an enemy? Sin is this adversary, it robs So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns of their subjects, Pastors of their people, and robs us of our dearest relations. We should therefore do by it as the <hi>Iews</hi> did by <hi>Paul</hi> (whom they lookt upon as their adversary, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.27, 28.) <hi>when they saw him, they stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, saying, Men of Israel help, This is he that is against this people, and against the Law, and against this place.</hi> So should we encourage each other against sin, and suppress it, saying, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, Ministers, men and brethren help, this is that which destroyes our people, wastes our Cities, unpeoples our Towns, opposeth the Laws, and brings confusion every where.</p>

               <p>THe Prophet having shewed this people their misery, and affrighted them with the Threatnings, hee comes now unto the <hi>Remedy,</hi> and shews them how they may prevent all that misery which like a flood was rushing in upon them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for their Idolatry, and that is by Repentance, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking their Idols, and turning to the Lord.

               <p>The Precept is short, but very comprehensive. It is indeed a brief of the whole body of Religion, or a summary of the whole duty of man. The Scripture doth in many places epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomize our duties, reducing them sometimes to eleven heads,

as <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. Sometimes to six, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 33.15. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.2. Sometimes to three, <hi>viz.</hi> Justice, Mercy, and humble walking with God. <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. Our Saviour hath epitomized them, and reduced them all unto two, <hi>viz. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thy self.</hi> But our Prophet here comes and summes them all up in one, saying, <hi>Seek the Lord.</hi>

                  </note>The word <hi>Seek</hi> is emphatical, and signifies not a bare wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or woulding, or some cold velleities, but an earnest, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, exquisite inquiring after God, and his wayes; and therefore the Septuagint render it by a compound word which signifies to seek out with earnestness and diligence till wee finde the Lord.

               <p>The word implies labour, industry, and constancy, wee must never rest till wee have found the Lord, as the woman that had lost her groat, continued seeking till shee had found it, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.8.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Here is the causative particle, <hi>For,</hi> which may bee ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>therefore,</hi> and then the sense will bee more current, thus, <hi>q. d.

               </p>
               <p>Yet some make the particle redundant here, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it onely as an expletive particle, oft so used by the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</hi> The sense is here entire without it.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Here is the object of our seeking, and that is <hi>God, Seek yee mee,</hi> Excellent things are the object of our desires; now there is none like God, and therefore none to bee desired like him. Hee is our Creator, Redeemer, Preserver, ours in all sweet Relations, our Father, Husband, Lord, King, &amp;c. and therefore to bee sought and served by us in an especial manner. One of these obligations call for observance and duty, but when all shall concenter, and meet in one, how great should our observance bee.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This seeking of God implies a sincere turning to him, a loving him with all our heart, a seeking him simply for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, it notes a trusting in him, a fear to offend him, a forsaking of all Idols and false wayes (as it follows in the next verse) delighting only in his pure word and worship, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.10.
<pb facs="tcp:58817:81"/>
and praying to him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7.

These are those things above, which we are commanded to seek, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3.1.</p>

               <p>

In the foregoing verse, the Prophet sets down positively and affirmatively whom wee must seek, and to whom wee must turn, and that is <hi>to the Lord.</hi> Hee comes now to shew us negatively, what wee must not do, and what wee must not seek, and that is <hi>Idols.</hi> Seek the Lord, but seek not Idols. God puts a But and Block in their way to keep them from them. <hi>But seek not Bethel.</hi> God can do all things; but Idols can do nothing; great reason then wee should forsake them, and cleave onely to God, who would have us first Table-men to worship him according to his own will revealed in his word; and then second Table-men, in righteousness towards our neighbour, vers. 15.</p>

               <p n="1">1 That <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Gilgal</hi> were such, I have shewed before at large on <hi>Amos</hi> 4.4. <hi>Bethel</hi> was the place where <hi>Ieroboam</hi> set up a golden Calf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gilgal</hi> was a City full of Idols, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.15. and 12.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beersheba</hi> was a City in <hi>Canaan</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly dwelt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.31, 32, 33. here God appeared to <hi>Isaac,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:58817:85"/>
Gen. 26.24 and here <hi>Iacob</hi> sacrificed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.1. This made these superstitious people think that there was more holiness in this place than in others, and therefore hither they came, when God had ordained them to go to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This City was afterwards allotted to the Tribe of <hi>Iudah, Iosh.</hi> 15.28, and 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.8. yet it was inhabited by the Tribe of <hi>Simeon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See more on Amos 8. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note> Josh. 19.2. It was scituate on the utmost South-border of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as <hi>Dan</hi> was on the North. It was a City given to Idolatry, as <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Gilgal</hi> were, and therefore the Lord giveth a strict injunction here, that they should not go to any of them.</p>
               <q>But seek not Bethel, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>q. d. If you will bee my people, you must cast away your Idols, you must not go to worship the golden Calf at</hi> Bethel, <hi>nor to the High-places and Idolatrous Altars at</hi> Gilgal <hi>and</hi> Beersheba, <hi>for these places shall perish with the Idols that are in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Pass not to Beersheba.</q>
               <p>The Kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> was divided from the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> yet so mad were this people on Idols, that they will post over the Country of <hi>Iudah</hi> after them, when they had too many at home already.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To strengthen the Dehortation, here is a reason added, drawn from the danger which would follow if they followed Idols, both they and their Idols should perish. <hi>For</hi> Gilgal <hi>shall surely go into Captivity</hi>; that is, the Inhabitants of <hi>Gilgal</hi> (<hi>Met. subj.</hi>) going they shall go, <hi>i. e.</hi> they shall suddenly and certainly go into Captivity by the hand of the <hi>Assyrian.</hi>

               <p>GOod things are hardly beleeved, and slowly practised, and therefore the Prophet here renewes his Exhortation of seeking God by true Repentance, and that he might the better prevail with them, he useth a double Motive.</p>
               <p>The first is drawn from the danger which would ensue if they refused; the Wrath of God would break forth upon them like a consuming fire, so that all their superstitious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices at <hi>Bethel</hi> should not be able to quench it.</p>
               <p>The second is drawn from the glorious and tremendous Majesty of God, with whom they had to doe; and this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately set forth, vers. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>In this Verse we have a Repetition of the fore-going Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to seek the Lord, that they might live, q. d. <hi>If ever you desire to be truly happy, you must forsake your Idols, and false-worship, devoting your selves wholly unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Here is a Reason to inforce the duty, <hi>Lest the Wrath of the Lord break out like fire in the house of</hi> Joseph, <hi>and devour, it, and there be none to quench it in</hi> Bethel.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 It is <hi>formidable and terrible</hi>; Fire of all Creatures is the most dreadful. Hence the doleful Torments of Hell are set forth by fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.12. and Gods Wrath is called, <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming fire,</hi> Deut. 4.24. which burns up all that stands in its way. This made him cast out Angels, hurl out <hi>Adam,</hi> drown the old world, fire <hi>Sodome,</hi> root out the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> Lev. 18.25. and destroy <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> As all in God is infinite, his Mercy, Justice,<note place="margin">See D. <hi>Preston</hi> on Rom. 1.18. p. 114, &amp;c.</note> &amp;c. so is his Wrath, which makes it so exceeding ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and intolerable. Should all the Creatures set to their help, yet they were not able to uphold a man under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Gods wrath.</p>
                  <p>Hence the dearest of Gods Servants (though they have had Gods Spirit to uphold them) yet have cryed out of this, as a burden too heavie for them to bear; and have chosen rather to endure any tortures, than to lye under the wrath of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry God. They fear not him who can but kill the body, but they say with the Prophet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 76.7. <hi>Thou, even thou art to be feared, and who may stand before thee when thou art angry?</hi>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:58817:88"/>
Gods wrath is like a great Bell, it is long in raising, but when it is up, it makes a hideous noyse. Or like Lead, which as cold of it self, but when once melted, nothing scalds more terribly. What calmer and smoother than the Sea, yet when stirred what more tempestuous?</p>

                  <p n="3">3 It is <hi>inevitable,</hi> there is no flying from it, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.1, 2. if a King bee angry with us, we may flye out of his Dominion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if the King of Kings bee against us there is no flying out of his Territories.</p>

Should all the world rise in opposition against God, they would bee no more before the fire of his wrath, than a little dry stubble, or a few crackling thorns. Wood is longer in burning, and leaves some coals behinde, but stubble and thorns are suddenly and utterly consumed, and scarce any ashes left, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.7. <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.24. and 9.18. and 47.14. Fire and water have no mercy, there is no intreating them; such is Gods wrath in reference to the wicked, as good speak to the fire not to burn, or the water not to drown, as to the wrath of God not to consume wicked men, it must and will burn them, and none shall quench it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.20. Though <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> stood before the Lord to intreat, yet the sentence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reversed, wrath must devour and consume the wicked, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15.1.

                  <hi>q. d.

               </p>
               <p>The Prophet here principally taxeth the great ones, and the Rulers of the people, who had the deepest share in this guilt; they should have been patterns of Justice and Righteousness
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58817:90"/>
to their inferiours; but they being evil themselves, corrupted the rest, as bad humours use to flow from the head to the body, and therefore the Prophet falls heavy upon them, as hee did before, Chap. 4.1.</p>
               <p>These corrupted Justice, and made that which is in it self most profitable and pleasant, to become bitter and distasteful by oppressing the poor and helpless. This is called <hi>Wormwood</hi> here, and gall and poyson, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.12.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Because such unrighteousness and oppression is very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing and bitter to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is bitter to the poor and <hi>oppressed.</hi>

               <p>Justice and Equity is a most sweet and precious thing, and doth wonderfully help to preserve the peace and prosperity of a Land. This is a sanctuary and shelter for the innocent and the oppressed; but these oppressing, self-seeking Rulers had made a poyson of a remedy, and turned that which was ordained for the safety of the afflicted, to his ruine. These Rulers had turned Justice into wormwood many wayes.</p>

               <p>THis rustick plain Prophet begins here to raise his stile. The better to awaken these sensual and secure sinners, he sets before them the dreadful &amp; glorious Majesty of that God with whom they had to doe, <hi>q. d.</hi> you have not to doe with a dead and impotent Idol, that will be pleased with dead and dull services, and pacified with childish toyes and trifles; but you have to doe with the living and Omnipotent God, who is the Creator and Governour of all things, who appoints the vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situdes
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58817:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Day and Night, of Summer and Winter; who numbers the Starres of Heaven, and calls them all by their names; who waters the earth with rain, and strengthens the weak against the strong, and makes the spoyled victorious over the spoyler. It was the great study of the Prophets, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of this our Prophet, to set forth the Lord in his Majesty and Glory, that they might the better work upon their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. See <hi>Amos</hi> 4.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.6.</p>
               <p>In this Verse we have a magnificent description of Gods Omnipotency, he is,

                     <item>The Creator of the Starres,</item>

And therefore the Prophet calls upon them yet once more, to seek this Great, Almighty one. This oft pressing of this duty notes the necessity, Excellency, and difficulty of it. It is not so easie a matter to repent as many imagine, the heart of man is exceeding hard, and his eares are stopt against Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels, so that the Lord is forced to call again, and again, for audience and admittance.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Prophet begins first with the Stars, because the Majesty, Power, and VVisdome of God is wonderfully seen in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, order, multitude, and magnitude. Under these two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations all the rest of the Starres are comprehended, by a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche of the part for the whole, for he that made one made all, and the least are ordered by him as wel as the greatest. But because these two were most eminent and obvious, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known, therefore he chiefly instanceth in these two; they are mentioned only three times in Scripture, viz. <hi>Iob</hi> 9.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 38.31. and in the Text.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THere are two great impediments that keep men from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. The one is a low conceit of God; The other is an high conceit of themselves. The first the Prophet removed Verse 8.9. by setting before them the glorious Majesty of God. The second hee comes to remove in this and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verses, by setting before them their sin and misery, that so (if possible) hee might fit them for mercy.</p>
               <p>In this Verse wee have a second sin and cause of <hi>Israels</hi> ruine, and that is obstinacy and hating of reproof. This was their sinning sin which helpt to ruine them with a witness; the Lord in great mercy sent Physitians to them, but they abused them, and like frantick Patients threw the physick to the walls, they hated to bee reformed, and cast Gods words behinde them.</p>
               <p>The words admit of some difficulty. The question is, <hi>Of whom doth the Prophet here complain, whether of the Rulers, or of the people?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Of both. 1 Of the people, <hi>They hate him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth in the gate</hi>; that is, they hate the Judges who executed judgement in the gate; they hate him who thus censureth and judgeth them for their sin; for there is a double reproof, 1 <hi>A civil reproof</hi> given by the Magistrate, his just sentence upon the wicked is a real reproof of his wickedness, and that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate which faithfully and impartially thus reproves men in the gate, must look to bee hated by the wicked of the world, so was <hi>Iob</hi> that renowned Magistrate, <hi>Iob</hi> 30.1, 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And most genuinely, it is taken for <hi>spiritual reproof,</hi> by the Prophets who were wont to reprove open sins openly: <hi>They hate him that reproves in the gate,</hi> that is, in the public and open Assemblies; for the gates of the City were places where usually was much concourse of people, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.21. and 8.3.

               <p n="4">4 To shew the equality and indifferency of Justice from which none were excluded, but as the gates of the City were open to all, to go in and out at pleasure, so should the Courts of Justice.</p>

               <p>WEe are now come to a third sin, for which the Prophet reproves this people, and that is for <hi>Oppressing the poor,</hi> and this was more peculiarly the sin of their Rulers and Grandees. They that should have been the keepers of the Law, they were the greatest breakers of it; they that should have been the Vindicators, they were the Violators of it. The Prophet therefore strikes not at the foot, <hi>viz.</hi> the common-people; but he strikes at the head, from whence all disorders descended unto the body.</p>

                  <hi>Yee take from him burdens of Wheat</hi>: that is (say some) you extort such great bribes, and lay such great burdens on them, that they are forced to sell their necessary food to feed you with money.</p>
               <p>Others refer it to the great men, who lent the poor money till their harvest came in, and then were so rigid and severe in exacting their debts, that they made them bring their very corn which should support their Families for payment.</p>
               <p>Others refer it to the cruel Usurers, who were not content with money for their money, but they must have corn too, which after they sold at dear rates to the poor, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.4, 5.</p>
               <p>But what ever Oppression it was specifically, yet in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral the Prophet reproves it as a crying sin, that they dealt so harshly and cruelly with the poor, as first to rob them of their mony, and then by force or fraud to make them bring and bear upon their own shoulders that little which they had left to sustain themselves, and their families. To take away mens goods and cattel is sad, but to take away their corn, which is

the staffe and stay of their houshold, and to make them carry it themselves, and become their own executioners, in carrying away the livelihood of their Families, is such a crying sin, that the Lord swears that hee will bear no longer with such Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals that devour the poor alive, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.1, 2.</p>

As thou shalt betroth a wife, and thine enemy shall lye with her, so the like misery shall attend thee in thy building and planting. It is misery enough to have these things taken away by enemies, but it is a great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this misery, when after we have taken much pains to get them, and have set our hearts upon them, and are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with hopes and expectations of enjoying the fruit of our labours, then on a sudden to have them all snatched from us, and so our hopes to be frustrated, and others to enjoy our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, this is bitter.</p>
               <p>Or if they should escape these miseries, yet the Lord can smite them with sickness, so that they shall not enjoy what they Idolized; or else they have a prodigal heir, or some other vexation befalls them; so that <hi>in the very fulness of their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency they shall bee in straits,</hi> Job 20.22.

               <p n="2">2 <hi>They should plant pleasant Vineyards, but not drink the wine of them.</hi> Great was their care and cost to build houses and plant Vineyards (under these two synecdochically are comprehended all other creature-delights) but they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in their hopes, for they should neither enjoy the one, nor the other; and we see by daily experience, how these transitory things are tossed like a foot-ball from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

now one man hath it on his Toe, and anon another, at last comes one and trips up his heels, and gets it from them both, and at last comes death and strips them of all.</p>

               <p>Yet their sin deprived them of all these temporal delights, the Lord did retaliate them in their owne kind, as they had spoyled the poor, and taken all from them, so now the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> should come and cast them out of all.</p>

               <p>THe Prophet goes on to shew the sad and deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this obstinate people, whom neither God nor man could work upon. The Lord tells them in the precedent verse, that he knew all their works, and the Prophets told them of judgements coming upon them for those wicked works; but they misused the Prophets of the Lord, and hated him that reproved them in the gate, and were so resolvedly set upon sin, that the Prudent resolved to bestow no more counsel in vain upon them.</p>
               <p>In the words we have 1 The property of the Pious, they are prudent, wise, intelligent men. True beleevers, and such as fear God, are the truly wise men of the world. They do nothing rashly and inconsiderately, but do all with good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. They wisely compare things together, they observe the mysterious wayes of providence, and so become men of much sagacity, and can guess at the consequences of affairs. These are called prudent men. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.16. and 16.21. <hi>Isa.</hi> 3.3. They fore-cast, and consider what is to be done and spoken, how, when, where. As his words are spoken <hi>super ratis suis, Beophnau</hi> Prov. 25.11. in season, with a due concurrence of all circumstances, so his works are done in due season, fitly and successfully.</p>
               <p>The Original word signifies a cautious, circumspect, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent understanding man: hence they are oft called wise men, intelligent men, and men of good understanding by a

They were grown so violent and virulent, that they would neither hear, nor bear a reproof; they sought his death, who sought their life; and threw dirt in his face, who shewed them the glass; if any reproved them, they wrested and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreted all their sayings, devising devices against them to destroy them. They were come to that height of sin, that the malady was too strong for the medicine; and good counsel could doe them no good, it was but casting Pearls before Swine, which would be trampled under foot and lost; the more they reproved them for their Bribery, Oppression, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and cruelty,<note place="margin">

               <p>Q. <hi>But must not Ministers speak against Sin, for fear of bringing themselves into danger, nor speak against the evils of the times, unless they be sure to be free from suffering?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Ministers are bound by their Office to witness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the worst of evils in the worst of times; so did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, so did the Apostles. A Minister must not presently give over his Ministery, or forbear reproof because of some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching danger, yet he may be silent and forbear reproof, when those sins have been sufficiently witnessed against al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and men sin not for want of light, but desperately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the light; in such a case we have no reason to run our selves upon danger; and therefore our Saviour bids us let such alone,<note place="margin">

It is no dishonour to the Kings on earth to see the King of Heaven served before them; yea the worse the times are, the more should the zeal for Gods glory consume us.

               <p>The Prophet therefore speaks not here <hi>De jure,</hi> but <hi>De facto</hi>; not what men should doe, or not doe; but he rather intimates (such was the iniquity of the times, and the malice of those in authority) that <hi>De facto,</hi> they would not suffer them to speak against the corruptions of the times.<note place="margin">

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58817:112"/>
and cautious should all Gods Ministers be) yet he gives them a little crevise of light and hope, and comes with a <hi>peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> the Lord may yet be gracious to them. He speaks some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtfully to shew the difficulty of the work, and the better to excite their industry, and awaken them out of their security. Such <hi>bene sperantium formulae,</hi> such hints of hope are very frequent in Scripture, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.6. and 2.12, 22. and 16.12. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.29. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.14. <hi>Ionah</hi> 3.9. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>The Papists to keep their vassals in darkness and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, amongst other Scriptures they bring in this to prove that no man can be assured of his Election and Salvation in this life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But the Answer is easie; 1 The Lord doth not speak here of the Election, or eternal salvation of such as truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; but of their deliverance from outward afflictions and calamities which were threatned against them for their sins, vers. 6. These sometimes the Lord inflicts upon his people notwithstanding their repentance (as we see in <hi>David</hi>) and this he doth either for chastisement to make them flye from sin for the future, or else for trial.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Lord sometimes after he hath threatned judgements upon the wicked, yet upon their feigned humiliation holds his hand (that the world may see how highly he esteems the true repentance of his people) as we see in <hi>Ahab</hi> and the <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</hi> Considering therefore these various dispensations of God, the Prophet speaks doubtfully here, and exhorts them to repent, referring the event to Gods wise and gracious provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. So that such places speaking of temporary chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, make nothing against the certainty of our Election.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The particle <hi>Ulai,</hi> peradventure, is not alwayes <hi>dubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> but sometimes <hi>assertive, q. d.</hi> seek the Lord sincerely, and then without doubt, he will receive you graciously, and so the word is used, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 14.12. <hi>Peradventure the Lord will be with me, and I shall drive them out. Caleb</hi> speaks not here dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, but beleevingly, <hi>q. d.</hi> Though the work be difficult, yet the Lord will be with me, and by his help I shall drive out these formidable Giants out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> so <hi>Hester</hi> 4.14. So here the Prophet doth not question whether God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a penitent sinner to mercy, for that the Scripture proves abundantly, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. but the Prophet by this <hi>peradventure,</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:58817:112"/>
gives them some hopes that if they would turn to God, he would turn to them, and either remove or sanctifie these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which were coming on them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Dato,</hi> Suppose we grant that it is a doubting speech, yet it makes not for their purpose, for it is not to be referred to God, as though it were doubtful whether he would pardon the sins of penitents, for we have his hand and seal for that. But it is to be referred to those secure sinners, of whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance the Prophet might well doubt, lest either it would be none at all, or else but feigned and hypocritical.</p>
               <p>Yea fifthly, Should we grant that it is a doubtful speech, and to be referred to God, yet it maketh nothing for Popish or Arminian doubting, for the Prophet seeing to what a height of impiety these sinners were come, thought it not fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them presently, and raise them up suddenly, but first to humble them, and by speaking doubtfully to give them a hint of the hainousness of their sins, as though it might well be doubted whether the Lord would forgive them or no, that so they being feared and humbled, might be fitted for mercy: And because things that are hardly come by are more earnestly sought, therefore the Prophet intimates unto them, that it was no easie matter to obtain forgiveness for such hainous sins, that he might hereby incite them to a more thorow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and crying for mercy.</p>

This people were apt to sooth themselves, and cry peace when there was no peace, and therefore the Prophet deals plainly with them, and bids them not flatter themselves with thoughts of impunity, for their mirth should now be turned into mourning, and their singing into sorrow; yea such sad calamities should come upon them, that all should mourn, both Citizens and rusticks, both real and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial mourners.</p>

As in a time of mirth men call their neighbours together to rejoyce with them, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.6.

               <p n="1">1 They had <hi>Minstrels,</hi> which with their mournful tones and sad tunes inclined the affections of the people to mourning for the dead. Of these there were two sorts, 1 Some played on Pipes.<note place="margin">

                  <q>Wo unto you that desire the day of the Lord, to what end is it for you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>WE are now come to the third part of this Chapter, where the Prophet inveyes against two sorts of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The first are mockers and deriders of the Prophets threatnings. The second are such as trusted in their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Sacrifices, Vers. 21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>In the precedent Verse the Prophet had told them that the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58817:116"/>
Lord would pass thorow them in wrath, these impudent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in a taunting, sarcastical way ask the Prophet when this would be, <hi>q. d. You Prophets tell us of a dark and dismal day, a day of wrath and trouble which will come upon us, but we see nothing comes; if God be in earnest let him make speed and come when he will, we fear neither him nor thy threatnings; nor do we beleeve that ever such a day will come, or if it do come, yet it will not be such a dreadful day as you speak of; for God will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his people which he hath spared so long from destruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus these desperate Atheists being wholly drowned in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, sensuality, and carnal delights, scoff at the Threatnings, and jest at Gods judgements, neither fearing the one, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the other, but esteeming the words of the Prophet as wind and his comminations as a vain mockery.</p>
               <p>To these Flouters at the Threatnings and mockers at the Lords long-suffering, the Prophet answers, <hi>Wo to you that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the day of the Lord,</hi> it will come too soon upon you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wishing for; did you but know the terror of it, you would never desire it. <hi>To what end is it for you thus to speak?</hi> Did you but know what kinde of day it is that is hasting on you, you would not so much desire it, you will think it comes too soon when it comes (the Devils thought so, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.29.) when God comes he will come as an armed enemy against you to your utter destruction; so that you have great cause to fear, and by repentance to prevent, rather than to desire that day; yet these hypocrites either as conceited of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and confiding in their priviledges, desired this day; or else in mockery and scorn, they cry, When will that day come, which <hi>Amos</hi> so much talks of, we would fain see it. So you shall (saith the Prophet) time enough to your sorrow; <hi>For it is a day of darkness, and not of light</hi>; and therefore woe be to you that thus scoffingly desire the day of the Lord, you will finde it no jesting matter when it comes, it will be a dark and dismal day to you, though now you make your selves merry with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By a day of darkness</hi> here is meant, the time in which God would destroy the Kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> according as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had fore-told. <hi>Allegorically</hi> and allusively this is true of the day of Judgement, it will be a day of darkness and terror to all wicked men; but <hi>literally</hi> this day of darkness
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58817:116"/>
and not of light, that is, this day of exceeding darkness (as the Hebrew <hi>Idiom</hi> imports) as we may see <hi>Amos</hi> 9.4. <hi>I will set mine eye upon them for evil, and not for good.</hi> The denial of the contrary hath a great emphasis in it, <hi>q. d.</hi> I will bring upon them all manner of evil, but no good. So here, <hi>It shall be a day of darkness, and not of light</hi>; that is, it shall be a very dark and dismal day in which they shall finde no light of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from the Lord, but wrath shall come upon them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most. In that day the Lord will exert his power in executing his vengeance on the Kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> for all their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Apostacy, Security, Hypocrisie, &amp;c. The various and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable calamities of this day, are elegantly set forth in the next verse, where the Prophet shews how the judgements of God should beset them round, so that if they escaped from one evil, yet another should apprehend them, and if they fled from a Lion, yet a Bear (which is more savage) should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them.</p>
               <p>It is usual in Scripture to call <hi>a day of Adversity,</hi> misery and distress, by the name of <hi>Darkness,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> 20.16. and 23.17. and 30.26. <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.30. and 21.12. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.2. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.14. to 18. Hence the doleful condition of the damned is called utter darkness. As <hi>light</hi> signifies prosperity, joy and comfort, <hi>Hest.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Iob</hi> 18.6. and 38.15. <hi>Psal.</hi> 97.11. and 112.4. So <hi>darkness</hi> signifies calamity and sorrow, as I have shewed on <hi>Amos</hi> 8.9.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But why doth the Prophet denounce a Woe against those that desire the day of the Lord, when it is the earnest desire of the Saints in Scripture that the day of the Lord would come, and they dayly pray,</hi> Thy Kingdome come, <hi>and it is made a kinde of a Periphrasis of a beleever, that he is one that longs for the day of the Lord,</hi> 2 Tim. 48.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We must distinguish, 1 Of dayes; 2 Of persons. 1 There is a double day of Judgement; 1 There is a day of temporal judgement when the Lord ariseth to execute judgement upon the heads of incorrigible sinners, such as the old world, <hi>Sodom, Ierusalem</hi>; and these dayes have in them a glimpse and shadow of that great day of the Lord, and therefore they are called a day of blackness, and darkness, a great and terrible day which none can abide, when the earth shall tremble, and the Sun and Moon be dark, and the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58817:117"/>
Stars withdraw their light, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.2, 10, 11. All these hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical termes set forth the dreadful desolation which should fall upon the wicked in this life. But this is not that day which the Saints desire.</p>
               <p>The day which the godly so much desire and long for is, that great and general day of Judgement, that day of their full Redemption when they shall enjoy both in body and soul full communion with Christ their head.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We must distinguish of <hi>persons,</hi> some are beleevers and some are unbeleevers, and hypocrites; the Prophet speaks not here of beleevers, but of self-conceited-hypocrites, who being puft up with high conceits of their own innocency, &amp; thoughts that God would acquit them, though the Prophets condemned them, they conceited that would God deal more gently with them, than those harsh, plain-dealing Prophets, and would not judge them so bad as they had reported them to be.

               <p>THis people still dreamed of impunity, and because the Lord bare long with them, therefore they concluded he would never come; or if he did, they would shift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and if troubles were in one place they would flye to

another; but the Prophet tells them, that these shifts would not avail them in the day of Gods wrath, for all places should be full of snares and dangers, so that there should be no safety at home or abroad; for God would multiply evils upon them. So that if they escaped one, yet another should apprehend them; as if a man being in the Field or Wood should flye from a Lion, and a furious Bear should meet him, or flying from a Bear, a Serpent should bite him. It is a kinde of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> where the speech riseth, and the Prophet shews that if they escaped one evil, yet they should fall into a worse. To have a Lion pursue a man is very dangerous, but to fall into the mouth of an hungry Bear that is worse, but to escape both, and flying into an house for shelter and succour, and laying his hand upon the wall to ease and uphold himself, to have a Serpent sting him there where he looked for most secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, this is worst of all.

               <p n="3">3 They failed in the <hi>Manner,</hi> they should have performed all these duties singly and sincerely, in obedience to Gods command, but they meerly sought themselves in all they did, hypocritically resting in their external observations of Feasts and Sacrifices, of Songs and Musick in their Temples, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this means to expiate their sins. In this Verse therefore we have a Prolepsis, or preventing and anticipating of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, whereas they boasted that they were the people of God, and did service to him. To this the Prophet brings in the Lord, saying, I hate and abhor your Services, since they come from such wicked persons, who are my profest enemies, and what you doe, hath no foundation in my Word, but is a meer will-worship of your owne inventing.</p>

               <p>But our reading is good, I hate your Feasts, for the despising of their Sacrifices follows in the next verse.

But the Lord tells them, <hi>That he will not smell in their solemn assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</hi> It is a Meiosis, q. d. I greatly loathe them; meet as oft. as you will, but I will not meet you there, nor once smell in your assemblies. To smell a sweet savour, signifies Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable acceptation and approbation; thus when <hi>Noah</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a Burnt-offering to the Lord, it is said, the Lord smelt a sweet savour which pleased him well, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. so <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.31.</p>

               <p>So in our Sacraments, how contemptible to a carnal eye, is the sprinkling of a little water, a bit of Bread, or a sup of Wine, but consider them as Gods Ordinances, which he hath ordained, to seal and assure us of our reconciliation with him in the Bloud of Christ, and so they are weighty matters.

               <p>It is called <hi>Shelem,</hi> because this sacrifice was offered for the peace, safety, and prosperity that they had already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or should hereafter receive, either generally or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly; and this they did either voluntarily of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or as bound by vow, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.15. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.1, 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.7. but the other Sacrifices were necessary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</p>

               <p>But the Answer is easie. 1.

They must not confine Justice, nor imprison it, but as occasion requires they must abundantly dispense and disperse it abroad.

                  <q>Have yee offered unto mee sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THe Prophet comes now to conclude the Chapter with an Amplification of the Superstition and Idolatry which from first to last did abide in <hi>Israel.</hi> Their <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> of old were Idolaters in the wilderness, there they worshipped the golden Calf, and <hi>Baal-Peor,</hi> Numb. 25.1, 2, 3. No sooner were they come to <hi>Canaan,</hi> but they were on their knees to <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Ashtaroth,</hi> Judg. 2.13.</p>
               <p>Yea and then their Posterity (saith the Prophet) have justified them in their Idolatries, and shewed that the evil is hereditary, and so the more to be abhorred; in that you have added Calves to Calves, and Idols to Idols, lest they should boast of their Ancestors, the Lord upbraids them with their Fore-fathers, and tells them that they were Idolaters before them, and were punisht for their Idolatry, and so should they; as they had been like them in sin, so they should be like them in suffering.</p>
               <p>In the words we have, 1. <hi>Israels</hi> sin, <hi>They sacrificed not to God,</hi> but to Idols, as in the next verse.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:58817:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>2 Here is a double aggravation of their sin, both in respect of Time and Place.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Here is the <hi>Time</hi> how long they grieved the Spirit of God, not forty daies, but forty years, even the whole time of their abode in the wilderness.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The <hi>Place,</hi> it was in the Wilderness, where they lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Rod, and were kept under severe Discipline, and where the Lord lead them miraculously, and fed them mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously, with Mannah from Heaven, giving them waters from the Rock, and with a mighty hand protecting them, and carrying them upon Eagles wings, above the reach of many dangers and distresses, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.1, 2.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>locus difficillimus</hi> (saith <hi>Mercer</hi>) this verse, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially the next are two of the hardest verses in the whole Prophecy. Many doubts do here arise.</p>
               <p>Quest. 1. <hi>Why doth the Prophet charge this people with not offering sacrifice in the wilderness, when they never lived in the wilderness, but lived many ages after their Fore-fathers came out of the wilderness? as appears by the series of those Iudges and Kings which governed them since the time that they came from</hi> Egypt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though the same numerical men were not in the wilderness, yet the house of <hi>Israel</hi> was there, and what their Fore-fathers did, is imputed to the posterity who made up one body with them, and were bound up in the same bundle with them.</p>
               <p>These walking in the Idolatrous steps of their Fore-fathers, justified their Idolatry, and as they worshipped the golden Calf in <hi>Egypt,</hi> so these worshipped the golden Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> Thus they being heirs of their Fathers guilt, and imitators of them in their Idolatry, the Lord chargeth them here with their sin also, saying, <hi>Have yee offered to mee sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the wilderness</hi>? Hee doth not say, Have your Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers offered sacrifice to mee? but he chargeth them with the sin; and this is usual in Scripture, when the children walk in the Ancestors sins, to charge the children with the sins also, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.35. Our Saviour chargeth the Jews with the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Zacharias, whom they slew.</hi> How could they slay those that were slain long before they were born?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> By imitating their cruelty, they approved of the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58817:129"/>
like cruelty in their progenitors, and so became partakers with them in their sin, and should partake with them in their plagues; not onely for the murdering of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, and those of latter times; but even for the blood of all the Saints that ever was shed to that day, even from the blood of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Abel,</hi> the first that ever was slain, to the blood of good <hi>Zacharias,</hi> who was so barbarously slain between the Temple and the Altar, <hi>q. d.</hi> God will visit the sins of the Fathers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you their children, that have walked in their wicked steps, with the greatest severity, because ye have sinned against the greatest light; and if the blood of one innocent <hi>Abel</hi> lay so heavy upon <hi>Cain,</hi> that he cried, his punishment was greater than he could bear; how sad is your condition that are charged with the blood of so many thousands of innocent, holy men! so that as all Beleevers are the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and have Interest in all the Promises that were made to him: So all persecutors are the seed of <hi>Cain,</hi> and have interest in all the curses which fell upon him.</p>
               <p>Quest. 2. <hi>How are all condemned here as Idolaters, when wee read of some good men amongst them that sacrificed to God, and not to Idols? as</hi> Moses, Eleazer, Joshua, Caleb, Phineas, <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>the Saint of the Lord, as the Psalmist calls him,</hi> Psal. 106.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Prophet condemns the body of this people <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quod major multitudo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta fuerat, ideò totus popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus meritò dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur.</hi> Calvin.</note> and not all and every individual person, singly. He speaks against the wicked Ancestors of wicked children, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those wicked children which walked in the steps of those wicked Ancestors; God had his remnant amongst them, and some grains of wheat in this heap of rubbish and chaff.</p>
               <p>Quest. 3. <hi>Have yee sacrificed to mee?</hi> The Interrogation is a strong Negation. So <hi>Ioel</hi> 1.2. <hi>q. d. You have not sacrificed to mee all that time, but you have discovered your averseness from mee, and your proneness to Idolatry on all occasions.</hi> But how can this be true, when we read that the Israelites did sacrifice to God in the wilderness? when the Covenant was ratified, they offered Eucharistical sacrifices to <hi>Iehovah, Exod.</hi> 24.4, 5. And after the dedication of the Tabernacle, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of <hi>Aarons</hi> sons, and at the celebration of the feast of the Passeover, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.21, 28. &amp; 9.2. <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.3. &amp; 9.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though they did offer some sacrifices the first and second year that they were in the wilderness, yet after they did not so ordinarily and so frequently, as when they came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> for in the wilderness they lived in want, and had not that plenty of Sheep and Oxen, as they had when they came into <hi>Canaan.</hi> They had scarce any flesh to eat, much less to sacrifice, therefore the Lord fed them with Mannah and Quails. Besides, they were in a fleeting condition, and so unfit for sacrificing, or for circumcision and therefore 'twas omitted in the wilderness for a time. They were not settled nor fixed, but as the Tabernacle removed, so they removed, and till they came to fix and settle, they could not so wel sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Answer lyes most genuinely in that little Emphatical word <hi>Mee, Have yee offered sacrifice to mee? q. d.</hi> 'Tis true, I grant, you have offered sacrifice (saith the Lord) but 'twas to your Idols, and to Devils, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.16, 17. and not to mee, both you and your Fathers worshipped Calves and Creatures, and the host of Heaven (as in the next verse) and not mee, and therefore I will punish you as I did them. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.15, 16, 18, 21. <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, they thought they worshipped God, and did him good service, but since they kept not to the Rule, but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the Lord according to their own inventions, with rotten hearts, and unhallowed lives, therefore the Lord dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owns all that they did, and tells us, that they did not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to him at all.</p>
               <p>Quest. 4. <hi>How is it said that for forty years space in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness they did not sacrifice, whereas 'tis apparent that the two first years at least they did offer sacrifice?</hi>

called <hi>Molech,</hi> Levit. 18.21. and <hi>Milcom,</hi> 1 King. 11.5, 33. Zeph. 1.5. and by <hi>Amos</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen</hi> it is called <hi>Moloch,</hi> Acts 7.43. they both upbraid the <hi>Iewes</hi> for worshipping this abominable Idol, and that in the Wilderness, where the Lord shewed them so many signal Miracles and Mercies; there they began to practise this foul Idolatry. The <hi>Ammonites</hi> had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gods, but one among the rest was their Patron, and tutelar god, which they called their King, <hi>Ier.</hi> 49.1, 3. <hi>Amos</hi> 1.15. (as they did this <hi>Moloch</hi>) but the Holy Ghost calls it an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, for that which is highly esteemed in the sight of men, is an abomination in the sight of God. This Idol not only <hi>Ammon,</hi> but <hi>Israel</hi> trusted in as their Guide, and Leader in their travels; which shewes their horrid ingratitude in casting off God, who had been so long their Protector and their King, and now to chuse an Idol, and a <hi>Moloch</hi> for their God and Guide, and therefore it is emphatically called <hi>yours, Your Moloch,</hi> which you chose for your God and King.

               <p>What this Idol should be, is hard to determine. 1. Some say, it was an hollow Idol shaped like a man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others make it an hollow Image made of Brass, having the face of a Bullock, and hands spread abroad like a man, that openeth his hands to receive somewhat.

               <p>Their second Idol was <hi>Chiun,</hi> and here again Interpreters are divided, and though it be not much material to know what this Idol was (the sin reproved being not in the name, but in the thing, which was an abominable Idol, however called) yet 1. Some say this <hi>Chiun</hi> was the Idol <hi>Hercules,</hi> which in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Language was called <hi>Chon,</hi> but varied into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Language might easily make <hi>Chiun.</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> calls this supposed Deity, <hi>Remphan,</hi> Acts 7.43. from <hi>Repha,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Gyant,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Because he followed the Translation of the Seventy, who being appointed by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to translate the Bible, they use the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> name <hi>Remphan</hi> in their Greek Translation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The name <hi>Remphan</hi> being better known to the <hi>Iewes</hi> in those dayes, (who made great use of the Septuagint) than that of <hi>Chiun,</hi> therefore the Evangelist mentions that rather than the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Others conceive that it might be <hi>Iove,</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> especially, which Planet they worshipped as their Guide and Leader in the Wilderness; it being the Leader of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and fore-runner of the Sun, and is called Lucifer, which is said to be placed in the fore-head of <hi>Moloch,</hi> because it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before the Sun-rising.

               <p n="3">3 But most genuinely it seems to be the Idol <hi>Saturn,</hi>

               <p>WEE have all along seen <hi>Israels</hi> sin, wee are now come to their suffering.</p>
               <q>I will cause you to go into Captivity.</q>
               <p>The Lord had freely given them the holy Land for their Inheritance, to the end that they might serve him with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of heart, in the abundance of all things; but since they had defiled that good Land with their abominations, the Lord resolved to rid the Land of them, and to send them into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity beyond <hi>Damascus,</hi> which was fulfilled when <hi>Salmaneser</hi> took <hi>Samaria,</hi> and subdued the Kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.6, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>q. d.</hi> Since your Fore-fathers were bad, and you are worse, treading in their Idolatrous steps, and out-going them in sin; therefore I will bring upon you the judgements threatned, driving you out of your own Land, and despersing you in forein Countries.</p>
               <p>In the words we have 1. A judgement threatned, and that is banishment and captivity. <hi>I will cause you to go into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. Here is the confirmation of this commination; 'tis not I, but the Lord, whose name <hi>is the God of Hosts,</hi> that hath said it, and he both can and will do it, unless by timely repentance ye prevent it.</p>
               <q>I will cause you to go into Captivity beyond <hi>Damascus.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. And more genuinely, whereas they looked on <hi>Damascus,</hi> (the Metropolis of <hi>Syria,</hi> a City of praise, <hi>i. e.</hi> a renowned, goodly, wealthy, strong City, <hi>Isa.</hi> 7.8. &amp; 8.4. <hi>Ier.</hi> 49.25.) as an impregnable fortress, and frontier defence for all their Country, and they might think to get shelter there, the King thereof being their confederate; the Prophet tells them that <hi>Damascus</hi> should not save them, for they should be carried captives beyond <hi>Damascus,</hi> even into the farthest and remotest parts of <hi>Assyria,</hi> beyond <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But how shall we reconcile</hi> Amos <hi>and</hi> Stephen? Amos <hi>saith they shall go beyond</hi> Damascus, <hi>but</hi> Stephen <hi>saies they shall go further, even beyond</hi> Babylon, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.43.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Some conceive it might be some mistake of the Scribe, beyond <hi>Babylon,</hi> for beyond <hi>Damascus,</hi> but there is no ground for such a conceit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Answer is easie, the difference is onely verbal, not material, in words, but not in sense.

               <p n="3">3.

               <p>These words admit of some difficulty.

Thus they bring in the Lord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding them for their ingratitude, that they had not rendred according to the mercies hee had shewed them.</p>
               <p>This sense is good, and many learned men go this way, and though it must bee acknowleded, that if wee look on <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, Israels</hi> Land with all its priviledges, <hi>it was the glory of all Lands,</hi> Ezek. 20.15. yet other Nations might surpass it for strength, and greatness of Cities, for largeness of borders, and for amenity and fruitfulness of soil, as <hi>Babylon</hi> did.</p>
               <p>But with submission to better judgements, I conceive the Interrogation to bee here an Assertion,<note place="margin">

That Almighty hand which brought them down, notwithstanding all their Ammunition and Fortifications, will also bring <hi>Israel</hi> down notwithstanding all their riches and strength.

               </epigraph>
               <p>IN this Verse the Prophet goes on with his charge, especially against the Judges, Rulers, Counsellours, and those in Power and Authority in the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel.</hi> Hee chargeth them in this Verse with two sins, which were the effects and evidence of their security before mentioned, Verse 1. The first is the contempt of Gods Threatnings,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:58817:144"/>
God oft foretold them by his Prophets that Judgements were coming upon them, but they would not beleeve it, but <hi>put the evil day far from them</hi>; Sleighting Gods Threatnings as if they had been but fables, and would never surprize them. Though they walk in wayes of wickednesse, adding sin to sin, and daily provoked the Lord to anger, yet they blest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their evil wayes, promising themselves peace and prosperity for all that. They were setled upon their lees, and lived without any fear or thought of danger, giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to Idlenesse, Wantonnesse, Pride, Luxury, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and all manner of Iniquity; not once thinking of the destruction which was coming upon themselves, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Yea they counted it a loathsome thing (as the word in the Original signifies) once to mention the evil day.<note place="margin">

                  </note> They were so given up to mirth and jollity, that they would not once hear of sorrow. They thought themselves priviledged by having the Temple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Gods worship amongst them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all storms and tempests. But the further they put away the evil day, the nearer it was to them; and though they could have wished there had been no such day, yet their wishes were but vain; for the Lord had decreed to bring a dismal day upon them, and it is not the counsels of men, but the counsels of the Lord that shal stand, and the thoughts of his heart unto all generations, <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.10, 11. As they had their evil day of sinning, so God was determined to bring upon them an evil day of suffering.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But what was that evil day?</hi>

               <p>But the words are better read <hi>actively</hi> (according to our Translation) setting forth the danger that attends voluptuous and sensual men,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>And cause the seat of violence to draw near.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a second effect and fruit of their security, and that is <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and Injustice, Cruelty and Oppression. <hi>They cause the seat of Violence to draw near.</hi> This sin doth necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the former, for when men are hardened in sin and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, putting off the Threatnings of God, and driving away all fear of danger from themselves, such must needs grow out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and cruel,<note place="margin">

                  </note> terrifying others with their Violence, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, Rapine, and Unrighteousnesse, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.10. So much the word in the Original implies; Iniquity acted by force, and violation of Justice.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But what is meant by causing the Seat, or Throne of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to draw neer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answr.</hi> 1. Negatively; it cannot be meant of the <hi>Assyrian,</hi> or any other enemies power that was coming neer; <hi>Yee cause the seat of Violence to draw neer</hi>; that is, (say some) by your sins yee cause the violent <hi>Assyrian</hi> and <hi>Babylonian</hi> to draw neer, and come against you to your own destruction. This is a Truth, but not from this Text.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Much lesse can it be meant of causing any false feasts or <hi>Sabbaths</hi> to draw neer;<note place="margin">The word is, <hi>Shebet, Sedes,</hi> 'tis not <hi>Shabat quiescere.</hi>
                  </note> as the Septuagint mistaking the Original (as they do very often) do render it, <hi>appropinquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes Sabbata mendacia,</hi> as if they had set up false Sabbaths, which God abhorred. But this is far from the scope of the Text.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither is it put Antithetically, by way of opposition to the former clause, <hi>q. d. O yee voluptuous and secure sinners, yee put the evil day far from you, and yet by your sins yee pull it upon you, persevering still in your oppression and cruelty; you would fain put off the judgement from you, yet you will

not remove your sins, which cause the Iudgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the meaning briefly is this. The Prophet chargeth them with their going on in their Luxury and Inhumanity, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing, and vexing the poor and needy, which had no helper. They were so hardned in their sin, that now nothing but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness, and violence reigned amongst them. They had turned the <note n="*" place="margin">

So much is implied by the Seat, and Throne of violence, as appears by the like expression, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.13. Christ commends the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> for her constancy to the truth, and that in a place <hi>where Satan had his throne,</hi> i. e. in a place where Heresie, Superstition, Idolatry, and all kind of wickedness prevailed, and bare sway without controul: for where sin reigns, there Sathan rules, and there he erects his throne.<note place="margin">

               <p>THe Prophet goes on with his Charge against the Rulers of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel.</hi> In this verse hee chargeth them with a <hi>fourth Sin,</hi> which was an effect and evidence of their secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that is <hi>Luxury and Sensuality</hi>; they spent their time in eating, drinking, sleeping, in mirth and musick, without any sense or sorrow for the afflictions of <hi>Ioseph.</hi> Like Swinish Epicures, they minded nothing but their pleasures, stretching themselves on their Ivory-beds, eating the fattest of the flock, inventing variety of Musick and Melody, and new waies to increase their mirth; drinking wine in deep carousing cups, and anointing their bodies with the principal and most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious oyntments which those times and places afforded. And that which highly aggravates their sin was this, that all this was done in a time of mourning, when Gods hand was upon the Regions round about them, and they should have humbled themselves in dust and ashes, and lay on the very ground for their great provocations; yet then were they lying on beds of Ivory, and gave themselves up to all manner of pastimes and merriment.

                  <p>There was both Precept and President in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Musick in the publick worship of God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.25, and 2.7, 6.

                  <p>Besides, <hi>the Church is neer and dear to God,</hi> and therefore ought to be precious in our eyes; it is his <hi>Benjamin, Ioseph</hi> loved all his Brethren, but he loved <hi>Benjamin</hi> with a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive love, and provides a double Mess for him.

And if Gods Servants have been affected with Impendent Judgements, that were but in the Clouds, and afarre off, how should we bee affected with the present miseries of Gods people? When <hi>Elisha</hi> fore-saw the evil that <hi>Hazael</hi> would doe to <hi>Israel,</hi> some years after, he wept; and <hi>Daniel,</hi> ch. 8.11, 12, 13. fore-seeing the misery which would come upon <hi>Ierusalem</hi> two hundred years after his death: he was even sick with sorrow, <hi>vers.</hi> 27. How would those Saints have wept in our dayes, to have seen these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, real evils, which press, and oppresse the people of God.</p>
                  <p>To incourage us, let us know that this work never goes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded. God takes the kindness we shew to his people as done to himself, he is fed, when they are fed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.35, 36. The <hi>Kenites</hi> kindness unto <hi>Israel</hi> was rewarded four hundred years after, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.6. Wee never please God better, than when we seek the good of his people; though we forget such labour of love, yet he will not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6 10. <hi>Laban</hi> was blest for <hi>Iacobs</hi> sake, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for <hi>Iosephs; Rahab</hi> that hid the Spies, was hid her self; <hi>Obadiah,</hi> that sheltred the Prophets of the Lord, was himself sheltred by God. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedmelech</hi> for the kindness which he shewed to <hi>Ieremy,</hi> had his life for a prey. God hath a Book of remembrance, wherein he records all that we doe for him, or his, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p>How sad then is the condition of those that are sensless,<note place="margin">Against such, see six Reasons in Mr. <hi>Gatalers</hi> Serm on Amos 6.6. p. 59, &amp;c. 2 Part, folio.

So themselves can but live in wealth and ease, they never regard the afflictions of <hi>Ioseph</hi>; like <hi>Gallio,</hi> they care for no such matters.

                  <p>But most sad is the condition of those, that instead of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Gods people, they persecute them, and adde affliction to the afflictions of those whom he hath wounded. These may
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:58817:158"/>
forget their owne cruelty, but God will not; he hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, but sworn it, that he will not forget their cruelty, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> 8.7. He punisht <hi>Amaleck</hi> four hundred years after, for his inhumanity towards <hi>Israel,</hi>

               <p>WE have before seen <hi>the Sin</hi> of the Rulers of <hi>Israel,</hi> we are now come to the several branches of their <hi>Punishment,</hi> whereof the first is Captivity, and deportation out of their owne Land. The Lord had borne long with them, and waited many years for their returne, but they abused his Patience, and turned his grace into wantonness, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

now he is resolved to put an end to all their Pastimes and pleasures.</p>
               <p>In this Verse we have, 1. <hi>A Iudgement</hi> threatned, and that is Captivity, <hi>Yee shall goe into captivity.</hi>

But the Rulers who were the prime offendors, and had been first in sin, should now bee first in punishment. They shall have the primacy amongst the Captives, they shall goe in the front of them, and lead them the way into Captivity. As in Dignity and Luxury they went before others, so now they shall have precedency in Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as you may see, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. Before they were all for the head of the Oyntments, and now they should have the head in Punishment.

It was about sixty years after that the Captivity came, which was but a short time comparatively, it is said even now to come upon them, because Gods decrees are sure, and what he determines to doe, is as sure as if it were already done. Thus to shew the certainty of <hi>Babylons</hi> downfall,<note place="margin">

               <p>The words are rendred by some, thus, <hi>And the sorrow of them that stretched themselves is at hand.</hi> This comes from the various rendring of two words in the Original, the first is the word <hi>Mirzach,</hi> which the Vulgar render <hi>Faction,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ground at all; others, <hi>Sorrow</hi>; but the word properly signifies a Funeral-feast, for in those dayes they had feasts at Burials, as well as at Bridals, <hi>Ier.</hi> 16.7.

These Funeral-Feasts were first ordained for the comforting of such as grieved for the loss of their friends by death, but these here abused them to wantonness, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
               <p>The other word which causeth this diversity, is the word <hi>Sur,</hi> which signifies to approach, or to depart, it is here taken in the latter sense, according to our Translation; <hi>The ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet of them that stretcht themselves shall be removed,</hi> q. d. all your mirth and merriment shall cease, and yee shall be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Captive into a strange Land.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>IN this Verse we have a <hi>Prolepsis,</hi> or preventing of a Plea which <hi>Israel</hi> might make for themselves, saying, Wee are the people of God, in Covenant with him, and have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Circumcision, the seal of the Covenant, and at this day we doe enjoy many glorious priviledges, and signal favours from him, and therefore it is not like that he will destroy us, whom he hath loved so long, and made the head of the Tribes, and the glory of the world. To this the Prophet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, Deceive not your selves with any vain confidence in your pomp, and priviledges, as if your glory and excellency could secure you from divine Justice; for I must tell you from the Lord, that since you have abused his blessings, hee abhors your Excellency, hates your Palaces, and will destroy your Cities wherein you trust, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. and the better to assure you to the truth of all this, he hath sworn it, <hi>The Lord hath sworn, that he abhors the excellency of</hi> Jacob.</p>
               <p>In this Verse we have, 1. A Commination, <hi>I will deliver up the City, with all that is therein</hi>; q. d. you glory in your two fortified Cities, viz. <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> you trust in the riches, strength, and fulness of them, but though they be never so full of men,<note place="margin">

               <p>WEE have heard of <hi>Israels</hi> Captivity before, but since that could doe no good, now comes the Pestilence, and that no ordinary one, which usually leaves some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht; But such a terrible, destructive Pestilence, that should sweep away all before it; insomuch that if ten men remaine alive, they shall all dye, and they shall be buried not in an ordinary way, but they shall be burnt, and that by the nearest relations, which was used by the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in cases of extream necessity, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.12.</p>

This sets forth the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Gods wrath against this people, for when the Plague rageth very fiercely, yet it usually spares some, if there bee four or five in an house, usually one is spared, or if eight in a Family, it may be two are spared; but when there are ten in a Family, and they must all dye, this is dreadful indeed.

                  <q>And a mans Uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No; then shall he say, Hold thy tongue, for we may not make mention of the name of the Lord.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>WHat the Prophet had exprest somewhat obscurely in the precedent Verse, he sets down more fully and clearly in this, viz. That the Pestilence should be so dreadful, that it should destroy whole Families, insomuch that there should not be living men enough to bury the dead. There should neither be Father nor Mother, Brother nor Sister, Son nor Daughter left alive to doe the last office of Burial for them; but a mans Uncle, or Kinsman must doe it for him, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dod, amator, amicus, pro pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quus, Patruus, significat gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratim quemvis amicum dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, &amp; per Synec. Spe. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truum.</hi>
                  </note> else hee may lye and rot above ground.</p>
               <p>This shews what great desolation the Pestilence had made amongst them, that the Uncle, or nearest Kinsman (to whom the right of succession to the Inheritance belongs) must bee constrained to burn the Body, that so he might carry the bones out of the house with more ease. This was servile work, and belonged to mercenary men appointed for that purpose, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.14. but for want of such ordinary Officers to doe it, the Kinsman must doe it.</p>
               <p>So that in this Verse we have, 1. An Amplification of that great desolation which the Pestilence should make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, it should be so terrible that it should destroy whole Families, and cut off those ordinary Officers which were appointed to bury the dead, insomuch that the next Kinsman. must be forced to doe it; neither shall he doe it in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way,<note place="margin">

                  </note> but he must burne his bones. <hi>Calvin</hi> and others make the Uncle alone to be both the burner of the dead, and the burier of his bones; they read the words thus, <hi>His Uncle shall take him up and burne him, that he may carry the bones out of the house.</hi> This reading seems to be most genuine and agreeable to the Text and context, setting forth the dreadful hand of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:58817:165"/>
God upon them, in that the Pestilence should be so fierce, that they should want ordinary Officers to bury the dead.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But how are they said to burne their dead, when it appears both by the Old and New Testament that the</hi> Jewes <hi>did bury their dead?</hi> Gen. 23.4 &amp; 49.31 &amp; 50.5, 25, 26. Mat. 8.21, 22. Joh. 19.41, 42.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is true, usually they did bury their dead in times of Peace, but in times of Warre they sometimes did burn their dead, as they did <hi>Saul,</hi> and his Sons, to prevent further abuse which might be offered to their bodies by the Philistims, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.12, 13. so in times of great contagion to prevent stench, and further infection, they burnt their dead, as in the text; They might also burne them to cleanse the house (which was fallen to the Kinsman) from legal uncleanness by the dead, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.14.

It is a mercy to have a Grave, and therefore when the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> are recorded, their burials are also mentioned; and those of highest merit were buried in the upper part of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers of the Sons of <hi>David,</hi> 2 Chron. 32.33. <hi>Asa</hi> a good King was honourably buried, with great solemnity, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.14. and so was King <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> Jer. 24.5. But so was not wicked <hi>Iehoram,</hi> 2 Chron. 21.19. and it was a curse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Iehojakim,</hi> that he should be buried with the burial of an Asse, and be contemptibly cast into a ditch, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.18, 19. It is reckoned as a Judgement, when men have no burial, <hi>Psal.</hi> 79.3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.26. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.23, 24. <hi>Ier.</hi> 14.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.4. and therefore <hi>David</hi> commends the burial of <hi>Saul,</hi> he blesseth and rewardeth the men of <hi>Iabesh</hi> for it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.5.</p>
                  <p>The Body is a peice of Gods Workmanship, curiously wrought, <hi>Iob</hi> 10.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33.4. <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.5. and therefore must not be carelesly thrown away, it was redeemed with the precious bloud of Christ, and is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.15, 29. and shall be raised up at the last day, and bee made like to Christs glorious Body, <hi>Iob</hi> 19.25. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                  <p>It is one of the last offices that we can doe for our Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we should therefore decently commit their bodies to the grave, as to a bed of rest, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.2. there to remaine till the general Resurrection of us all.

               <p>IN this Verse we have an Amplification, and Confirmation of the precedent commination, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. The Prophet tells them, that the destruction shall be general, high and low, rich and poor, great and small, none should escape, but as all had sinned, so all should suffer; a forreign enemy like a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent floud should over-run the Land, so that there should be no escaping.</p>

                  <q>Shall Horses run upon the Rock? Will one plow there with Oxen? for yee have turned judgement into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN the precedent Verse the Lord threatned a general Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against these general Sinners, but they trusting to their owne strength and glory, feared no Judgements, but concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Lord who had taken them into Covenant with himself, and adopted them for his owne peculiar people, and adorned them with many Priviledges above the rest of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about them, would not deal so sharply with them as the Prophet threatned; but would take some gentler course, plowing them still by his Prophets, and labouring to reclaime them by their Ministery.</p>
               <p>To this the Lord answers in this Verse, by a Prolepsis, he prevents this evasion and vain conceit, telling them, that it was to no purpose to take any more pains with them, or to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them with gentler rods, for they remained still obstinate and perverse, falling away more and more, growing worse and worse; so that he did but plow the rocks, and so break his Plows without any increase; and sow the sands, losing his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour on them; and therefore he is now resolved, that his Spirit should no longer contend with such rockey rebellious Sinners nor his patience wait any more upon them. The Interrogation is a strong Negation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Shall Horses run upon the rock, or Oxen plow there</hi>? No, they will not, they are not fit places for such purposes; and doe you think that I will alwaies sing to deaf men, and bestow my cost and care upon such rockey and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sinners, that will bring forth no fruit?</p>
               <p>It is a Proverbial speech,<note place="margin">

               <p>IN the first Verse of this Chapter, the Prophet upbraids the <hi>Israelites</hi> with their carnal confidence; and in this Verse he amplifies that exprobration; Yee are they (saith he) which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in things of nought, and glory in your own strength, to your own confusion, as it follows, <hi>vers.</hi> 14.</p>

                  <q>Thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me, and behold he formed Grashoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and loe it was the latter growth after the Kings mowings.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN this Chapter we have three Visions, the first whereof is that of <hi>devouring Locusts,</hi> which left little or nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. Where we have,</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Person revealing the Vision to the Prophet, and that is, the Lord, <hi>Thus hath the Lord God shewed me,</hi> in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Vision,<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi> on Amos 8.11. p. 215.216. fol.</note> the Judgements which he is about to bring upon <hi>Israel.</hi> This he mentions to procure the more authority to what he spake, that they might see they were not figments, or dreams of his owne inventing.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Here is the Vision it self, or what the Lord shewed him, and that is <hi>Grashoppers, and behold he formed Grashoppers.</hi> He did not call out Grashoppers already made,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iotser, fictor, à Iatsar, finxit, formavit,</hi> Isa. 43.1. Zach. 12.1.</note> but he saw the Lord forming and framing a new Army of Grashoppers out of the dust of the earth, or the like; which to Gods Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was as easie, as to bring out an Army of Grashoppers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But most call these Grashoppers Locusts, and so the very same word is rendred,</hi> Isa. 33.4. <hi>so that what shall we call them, Grashoppers, or Locusts?</hi>

And this last is the Locust-Grashopper in the text. It was a devouring Insect, that went in great multitudes together, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up all before them, and so bringing a Famine on the places
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:58817:176"/>
where they came, <hi>Ioel</hi> 1.4, 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.11. they are called a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an Army of Vermine for their swarmes and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</p>
               <p>Q. A <hi>second Quere is, VVhether these Locusts must be taken Literally, or Metaphorically, properly or symbolically?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. They may be taken literally for an Army of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects, which devour the fruites of the earth, and so cause a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; this is most genuine here, and it was one of those rods with which God chastned <hi>Israel,</hi> Amos 4.9. as for War, he speaks of that, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. but this especially relates to famine, and some Judgements begun before the time of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the second.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Others take them Metaphorically, for any kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastation or wasting whatsoever; or else for the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> which like so many Locusts should over-run the Land of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and devour all before them. Hence the <hi>Assyrian</hi> is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Razor, which should shave them even to the skin, <hi>Isa.</hi> 7.20.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Here is the <hi>Time</hi> these Locusts were formed, and that is, 1. Generally, <hi>in the beginning of the shooting up of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he latter growth.</hi> 2. More particularly, It was the latter growth after the Kings mowings. After the first fleece was mowed off for the use of the Kings horses, which was wont to be sooner than the common mowth. Locusts love not to feed on ripe and hard things: their delight is in young and tender things; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are very destructive to Immanths, and new-sowen fields. These hurtful Vermine God sent in abundance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>
               <p>And here againe Interpreters differ, 1 Some take this mowing or shearing of the Grass for the grazing with the Kings sheep,<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2 Others take it, for the mowing not only of Grass, but of Corn also in the Fields; for Husbandmen (especially in those fruitful regions) used to mow their luxuriant Corn, that it might thicken and stand the better; and if this latter blade were eaten by Insects or Locusts, the Harvest was lost, and Famine ensued. The vulgar Latine mistaking the Original, render it, <hi>Serotinus imber,</hi> the latter rain, but the word is,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:58817:177"/>
                  <hi>Lekesh, herba serotina, sive cordum</hi>) the latter mowth, and not the latter rain; and here again some fly to Metaphors, and conceive that this mowing <hi>adumbrates</hi> the devastation of <hi>Israel</hi> by the <hi>Assyrian</hi>; as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>elds when they are mowen, and their fleece is gone, are naked and deformed, so God would raise up the <hi>Assyrian</hi> that should rob them of their riches, and fleece them for their sins.</p>
               <p>The flourishing Grass notes the flourishing condition of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> but they abusing that condition, the Lord mowed them. 1. More lightly and overtly, by <hi>Pul</hi> King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> 1 Chro. 5.26. 2. More severely, by <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> who afflicted them very sore, and gained much of their Land and riches from them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 There was a latter growth in the dayes of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the second, when <hi>Israel</hi> began to flourish, and recover its losses, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14.25. but after this they grew worse and worse, till the Lord swept them out of the Land, and would hear no more prayers for them.</p>

               <p n="1">1 They were little and low in Temporals, both in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Riches, and Power, they were much impaired and wasted, by various calamities of Sword, Famine, and Pestilence, as appears by <hi>chap.</hi> 4. &amp; 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14.26. when <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond came to the Throne, <hi>the Lord saw that the affliction of</hi> Israel <hi>was very bitter, for there was none shut up or left, nor any helper in</hi> Israel.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They were low in Spirituals, in <hi>Ahabs</hi> time the Worship of God was generally corrupted, his Truths despised, his Ministers persecuted, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.4. and such a general face of Idolatry had over-spread the Land, that <hi>Elijah</hi> complains he was left alone, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.10. and in the ninth verse of this Chapter, the Lord threatens to lay their Sanctuaries wast, and that they should have a famine not of Bread, but of the Word of God, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.11, 12.</p>
               <p>Thus the Prophet pleads, not <hi>Iacobs</hi> merit, but Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and free-grace, so much the original word imports, to be favourable,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Salach, peper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, propitius fuit, condona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi>
                  </note> and propitious, to spare and pardon. The word is often used in the Law for forgiveness, upon oblation and intercession made by the Priest, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.20, 26, &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.11. He first beggs for pardon of their sin, for he knew right well, if the cause were removed the effect would quickly cease. Neither doth he plead <hi>Iacobs</hi> excellency, but his misery, to move the Lord to shew him mercy.</p>
               <p>q. d. <hi>Consider O Lord the low and sad estate of thy people,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:58817:179"/>
they are low in Temporals, and low in Spirituals, and few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and if thou still goe on thus with thy Iudgements, all must perish, and there will be none left to praise thee; if thou shouldst enter into judgement with thy Servants, there were no abiding.

                     </gap>ut as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is the glory of a man to pass by an offence, so it will make much for thy glory to pardon and pass by the sins and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of thy poor afflicted people.

               </p>
               <p>Thus this good Prophet did commiserate their condition, and intercedes for the life of those who sought his death; it is true, he had plainly and powerfully reproved them for their sins, according to his place and calling, yet that they might see he did nothing out of hatred, but by office and command from God, not out of passion, but out of compassion to them; he now prays for them, and prevails.</p>
               <q>By whom shall <hi>Jacob</hi> arise?</q>
               <p>Or, who shall raise <hi>Iacob?</hi> or how should he subsist, if thou still pursue him with thy Judgements? The Original word <hi>Kum</hi> hath many significations, which hath caused these vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lections; it signifies to arise, to stand, to establish, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide. Some render the word Transitively, for to raise, <hi>Who shall raise</hi> Jacob? <hi>i. e.</hi> who shall raise and restore him, and make him happy in the enjoyment both of Temporals and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals? Thus the sense is the same, take it which way you will.</p>
               <q>By whom shall he arise?</q>
               <p>The Prophet could not see who should effect this, and therefore he asketh the question, <hi>By whom shall he arise?</hi> he could discerne no visible means how the weakness of <hi>Iacob</hi> should be strengthened, and the lowness of <hi>Iacob</hi> be exalted, and therefore he goes unto God by Prayer. As when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is high we are apt to question, who shall bring downe these Gyants, these sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> these great <hi>Zanzummims</hi> of the world, for they are high and mighty?

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>In Gods Ministers there must be a due temperature of sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sweetness, of severity and mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They must have a holy anger against sin, yet mourn withall for the hardness of mens hearts; so did our Saviour, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.5. so <hi>Lot</hi> reproved the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> yet calls them brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.7. and <hi>Moses</hi> in his zeal was angry at the people for their Idolatry, yet prayes for them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. So <hi>Amos</hi> here sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inveighs against the sins of this People, yet takes up a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation for them, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.1. and here intercedes for them. Our zeal must be mixt with love, though we may and must sometimes reprove men sharply, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.13. yet must we not forbear praying for them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23. so did the Vinitor intercede for the barren Fig-tree, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.6, 7, 8, 9. every Minister must be <hi>Adamas &amp; magnes,</hi> he must harden his face like a flint, and have browes of brass to oppose the wicked; yet must he withall be a Load-stone, by his amiable, tender, and compassionate carriage to win them to Christ, lying in the breach for them, and running hazards to save them from destruction, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30.</p>

Thus the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving are commanded to pray for the living, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.16. but we have neither Precept nor President of any that ever prayed for the dead, now whatsoever is not of faith is sin; but such Prayers have no foundation in the Word of God, therefore they cannot be of faith.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>We must stirre up our selves that we may lay hold on God; using Arguments to move the Lord to pitty us. So doth <hi>Amos</hi> here, and so did <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.2, 3, &amp;c. and <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen. 32.11, 12. and <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 32.11, 12, 13. &amp; <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.9. &amp; <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. &amp; <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. &amp; <hi>David,</hi>

                  <p n="5">5 <hi>In our Prayers we must plead mercy, and not merit.</hi>

                  <p>The Prophet here beggs for pardon and forgiveness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were low, so doth <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 79, 8, 9. our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is Gods Mercy; it must needs be so, since all our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is as filthy raggs. Hence <hi>Nehemiah</hi> when he had done great things for God, yet being conscious to himself of many infirmities, he beseecheth the Lord to spare him, according to the greatness of his mercy, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.22. So <hi>Daniel,</hi> a man highly beloved, yet beggs for mercy and for pardon, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.18, 23.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>So is the Prophet here, O Lord I beseech thee, pardon the sin of this People. He knew right well that sin was the cause of all their sorrow, and when this peccant humour was once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the effect would cease; and therefore the Church prayes, <hi>Take away our iniquity and receive us graciously,</hi> Hos. 14.2. the godly can bear any suffering, but not sin. When the

                  </p>
                  <p>So it was with <hi>Israel</hi> here, which made the Prophet questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>By whom shall he arise</hi>? He was brought so low that thee could neither raise himself, neither was there any other that could help him up; their strength was so exhausted that there was no visible effectual means of their restauration.

It is only to be found in the Almighty; we are never so little or low but he can help us, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too high or too hard for him; though Salvation be not in our Hills, yet it is in Gods hand, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.23. he is the Lord of Hosts, and hath all power at command; and therefore the Prophet betakes himself to his Prayers as his best refuge,<note place="margin">See more in M. <hi>Good</hi> his Fast Ser. on Amos 7.5. preacht 1646.

                     <hi>O Lord I beseech thee spare thy people.</hi> This is one reason why the Lord lets things run to extremity, that he may drive us to our Prayers, as we may see in <hi>Hesters</hi> case.

                  <q>And the Lord said unto me, <hi>Amos</hi> what seest them? and I said, a Plumb-line. Then said the Lord, behold I will set a Plumb-line in the midst of my people <hi>Israel,</hi> I will not again pass by them any more.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THe Lord comes now to threaten not a punishment, (as formerly) but a total destruction of this impenitent Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and therefore this Vision is not barely propounded, but by a Dialogue is so clearly expounded, that he who runs may read it. The better to quicken both Prophet and People to attention, the Lord begins with a question, <hi>Amos what seest thou?</hi> The Prophet could more easily discerne the meaning of the two former Visions, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Locusts, and of the Fire; but God standing upon a wall with a Plumb-line in his hand, was harder to understand, and therefore the Lord goes on to explaine it to the Prophet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will set a Plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel</hi>; that is, I will now actually execute my Justice on them, which I have hitherto suspended in passing by their misdeeds; as I have formerly built them up by Line and Level, so will I now make an utter destruction of them, and will lay them in the dust. I have examined their works and wayes by the Rule and square of my Word, and I finde them so exceeding irregular, that I can no longer forbear them, <hi>neither will I passe by them, or pardon them any more.</hi> This latter clause is exegetical, and expounds the former; I have spared them twice already, but now I will make a final end with them; I will spend no more admonitions or corrections in vaine upon them, but I will deal with them as men use to doe with ruinous houses, whose breaches grow wider and worse every day than other, they pull them down, and lay them in the duft.</p>

               <p>The word <hi>Chohen,</hi> is used promiscuously for a Priest or a
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:58817:190"/>
Prince, for an Ecclesiastical or a Civil Governor. In those days (except it were in <hi>Iudea</hi>) many persons were both Priests and Princes, and ruled in Church and State. Hence the word is used for a Counsellor of State, or a great man, <hi>Iob</hi> 12.19 for a Priest,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> On Job 12.19.</note>

               <p n="2">2 Here is the <hi>Party accused,</hi> and that is <hi>Amos,</hi> a poor, plaine, pious, harmless Prophet.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Here is the Person <hi>to whom he is accused,</hi> and that is <hi>the King,</hi> Amaziah <hi>sent to the King,</hi> he could not well suppresse him himself, and therefore he sends to the Secular Power for ayd, desiring he may be either silenced, or banisht, or put to death.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Here is the <hi>Matter</hi> for which he is accused, <hi>viz.</hi> for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Rebellion, Conspiracy, and Treason; this he speaks to exasperate the King against him: the good Prophet did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discharge his duty faithfully, and perform that office which God had called him to, yet this is called <hi>Sedition,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy.</p>
               <p n="5">5 He aggravates the Crime from the <hi>Place</hi> where all this treason was acted, and that was not privily in a corner, or in another Kingdom, but openly in thy Kingdom, and <hi>in the midst of thy people Israel,</hi> even at <hi>Bethel,</hi> where was the Court and greatest confluence of all the subjects; so that thou hadst best look to it, O King, for intestine commotions are very dangerous.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Here is the Peoples ill resentment of all this, <hi>The Land is not able to bear all his words. Amos</hi> signifies a grievous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and he had not his name for nought, for he came loaded with many sad burdens and comminations against <hi>Israel,</hi> which made this stubborn people so unable to bear his words, <hi>q. d.</hi> Such a seditious, dangerous fellow is this New-found <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> that if thou, O King, doe not suppress him, the people will; for <hi>the Land,</hi> that is, the people of the Land cannot brook, nor bear his blunt and down-right preaching, for they hate him that reproves them in the Gate, and abhor him that speaks uprightly, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.10. Thus they complaine of <hi>Amos</hi> (without a cause) for conspiring against the King, when themselves conspired and combined together against the King of Kings without controul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:58817:190"/>
                  <hi>The Land cannot bear his words,</hi> much less can I, or any one that is devoted to the service of the King. His Prophesies are intolerable, for he disheartens the people by making them despair of their owne safety, so that he is no longer to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, O King, by thee, or thine, for the Land will never bee quiet till it be rid of him, either by banishment or death; there will be nothing but tumults and factions so long as he is tolerated to seduce the people.</p>
               <p>Thus we see how this malicious false Prophet layes on load, thinking that somewhat would stick; every word hath its weight, <hi>Quot verba, tot verbera,</hi> so many words, so many daggers to stab this good Prophet. Had the charge been true, as it was notoriously false, <hi>Amos</hi> had been a man of death indeed.</p>
               <p>To clear up all, let us look into the Charge more exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> Amaziah <hi>Priest of</hi> Bethel, <hi>sent to</hi> Jeroboam <hi>King of</hi> Israel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then,</hi> when the Prophet had made known to the people the Visions of God, concerning the ruine of the Kings house, and of the Kingdome,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Carnalibus ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Dei sine cruce non potest nuntiari, comes veritatis cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>x. Merter.</hi>
                  </note> then <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Priest can hold no longer, but he must persecute and prosecute the Prophet. Thus persecution ever attends the faithful dispensing of the truth; flattery (we say) findes friends, but truth hatred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He sent to King Ieroboam</hi>; that is, he sent Letters or Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers to the King, to incense him against <hi>Amos,</hi> and that clancularly and unknown to <hi>Amos,</hi> that so he might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, unheard. No doubt but this High Priest had his Spies and Intelligencers about him, to observe what <hi>Amos</hi> preached, and now having got matter enough (as he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) against him, to root him out, he spit his poyson, saying, <hi>Amos hath conspired against thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word which we render to conspire,<note place="margin">

                  </note> properly signifies to bind, or to be compactly bound together in a body; but Metaphorically it signifies to conspire, to rebel, to conjure and band together against one, so the word is used, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.8, 13. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.9. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 21.23. so that this conspiring implies that <hi>Amos</hi> had some confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with him, that helped to carry on this conspiracy against the King; when alas, <hi>Amos</hi> was so farre from <hi>conspiring,</hi> that he was now considering how he might prevent the ruine both of
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:58817:191"/>
King and Kingdom, and avert the approaching judgements. By his Prayers he had prevented two judgements, and now counsels them to prevent the third; yet <hi>Amos</hi> is a Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator and troubler of <hi>Israel,</hi> when it was their owne Idolatry and Apostacy, and not <hi>Amos,</hi> that troubled them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Amos</hi> did not vent his Passion, or speak his owne private opinion; but he tells them the mind and Message of God which he had shewed him in a Vision, and commanded him, to publish, touching the destruction (not of the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for we read not that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> dyed by the sword) but of the Kings Posterity, vers. 9. <hi>I will rise against the house of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam <hi>with the sword.</hi> But <hi>Amaziah</hi> conceiving that the King would be more inraged against <hi>Amos</hi> for Prophecying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, than for Prophecying against his Children, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon forgets this accusation, and saith, <hi>Amos</hi> hath conspired against thee, and hath said, the King shall dye by the Sword. Not a word of truth,<note place="margin">Amos <hi>non in Regem, sed in Amaziae men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacia, &amp; abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minationes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellavit.

               <p>Now by this high Charge we may see, that this false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet sought the life of the true one, as will appear if we frame his Accusation into an Argument, thus,</p>
               <p>He that hath conspired the ruine both of King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ought to dye; But <hi>Amos</hi> hath done so. <hi>Ergo.</hi> But it pleased the Lord (in whose hand is the heart of the King) to make the King so farre to favour the Prophet, as that hee sleighted this Priests accusation, and therefore <hi>Amaziah</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends friendship to ths Prophet, as we shall see hereafter.</p>

                  <q>For thus saith <hi>Amos, Jeroboam</hi> shall dye by the sword, and <hi>Israel</hi> shall surely be led away captive out of their owne Land:</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN this Verse <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Priest labours to make good his Charge against <hi>Amos,</hi> to this end he produceth a double accusation against him.</p>
               <p n="1">1 He chargeth him as an enemy to the King, and that hee had conspired against him, saying, <hi>Ieroboam shall dye by the sword</hi>; this was a manifest untruth, for <hi>Amos</hi> never said, the King shall dye by the sword, but that <hi>God would rise against the house of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>with the sword,</hi> vers. 9. and so he did, for though we do not read that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> himself dyed by the sword, yet <hi>Zachariah</hi> his Son was slaine by <hi>Shallum</hi> in the sight of
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:58817:196"/>
the people, which put an end to the Stock of <hi>Iehu,</hi> according to what the Lord had threatned against the house of <hi>Iehu,</hi> viz. that in the fourth generation his Stock should cease; so that <hi>Amaziah</hi> reports <hi>Amos</hi> his Doctrine to the King, not fully, but fraudulently, applying that to the Father, which <hi>Amos</hi> spake against the Posterity. Thus wicked men, like their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil, adde and detract from Gods Word, and mens words, so as may best suit with their owne designes.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He chargeth him with disheartning the people, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their owne Land.</hi> This was true, but so farre from being a Crime, that it was <hi>Amos</hi> his glory, that he faithfully and freely delivered the Message that God commanded him to deliver to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and here we may observe, that when this false Prophet recites <hi>Amos</hi> his words to the King, there he alters the words, and makes things worse; but when he comes to speak of the people, then he can speak truth.</p>
               <p>He had used all his Oratory to perswade the King to punish <hi>Amos,</hi> but <hi>Ieroboam</hi> knew that he was a Man of God, and therefore durst not doe his Prophet any harm; and the rather, because he had observed that God had sharply punished <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> the first with a withered arme, and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and other his Predecessors that had opposed his Prophets; their harms made him wise. The context shewes that the King was cold in the cause, for we read of no answer that the King gave to <hi>Amaziah,</hi> peradventure he might discerne his falshood and his flattery, and so sleight him; this is very probable by that which followes in the next verse, where <hi>Amaziah</hi> falls to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering <hi>Amos,</hi> since by force he could not hurt him.</p>

               <p>THis false Prophet seeing he could not remove <hi>Amos</hi> by force, sets upon him now by fraud; the King not being moved with his Message,<note place="margin">

               <p>But since the Lions skin will not doe, this Promotor will try what the Fox can doe; to this end he gives <hi>Amos,</hi> 1. An honourable title. 2.

               </p>
               <p>In this Verse this subtile Sophister packs up much in a little room, and useth almost as many Arguments as words.</p>
               <p n="1">1 He gives him an honourable Compellation, <hi>O Seer,</hi> it is not, O unlearned Herdsman, or, O seditious Seeds-man, as before; but he gives him a title of honour, the better to hide his malicious designes, and to insinuate himself into <hi>Amos.</hi> See how quickly wicked men can change their Language, and blesse those whom but lately they cursed; before it was <hi>Amos</hi> the Conspirator, but now it is <hi>Amos</hi> the Servant of God, and the Seer. The Prophets of old were called <hi>Seers,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Isa.</hi> 30.10. God inlightned them by his Spirit, and made known to them his secrets by Visions, hence they were called
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:58817:197"/>
Seers, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.12.6. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.1. Some make <hi>Amaziah</hi> here to call the Prophet <hi>Seer,</hi> Ironically, by way of scorn and contempt, as if the Prophet had been some Fanatick, and his Visions vanities. But the contexture of the Discourse is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this; for <hi>Amaziah</hi> gives the Prophet his due title, but in a flattering way, the better to effect his design upon him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Lest this Priest should seeme to be mad without reason, he now produceth Arguments to perswade <hi>Amos</hi> to be gone. Man being a Rational Creature, may sooner be drawn by reason than driven by force; <hi>Amaziah</hi> will try what this will doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goe, flee thee away into the Land of</hi> Judah, <hi>there eate bread, and Prophesie there.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Flee,</hi> with all speed be gone from amongst us, for there is no staying long in safety here; thou art encompassed here with snares and dangers, and therefore if thou lovest thy life, pack up and bee gone, <hi>Citò, citiùs, citissimè,</hi> lest thou bee caught and killed. So that this was an Argument <hi>a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sario.</hi>

               <p n="3">3 <hi>Into the Land of Iudah.</hi> The better to perswade him to flee, this Priest hath found out another Topick, <hi>viz.</hi> a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place to flee to, and that was his owne Country; thou camest from <hi>Tekoah,</hi> Amos 1.1. and no man can blame thee for going home againe, especially since thou art so hated here. There thou wilt dwell amongst thine owne kindred and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in peace and plenty, in love and safety; whereas here thou art a Stranger, and a blunt Prophet, and canst ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect none of these things from us. As a friend therefore I counsel thee with all speed to be gone, for both King and Kingdome are resolved to keep their Calves; and if thou come any more to preach here against them, beware lest they catch thee, and kill thee. But <hi>Amos</hi> fears no such Scar-crows, God sent him not to <hi>Iudah,</hi> but to <hi>Israel,</hi> and there he must and will abide. It was <hi>Ionahs</hi> sin to fly to <hi>Tarshish,</hi> when hee should have gone to <hi>Niniveh.</hi> A Minister is not <hi>sui ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>

Here is nothing for thee to eate, here is no profit to be had, and by thy preaching so openly at <hi>Bethel,</hi> against the Calves of <hi>Bethel,</hi> thou marrest our markets too. But goe to <hi>Iudah,</hi> there thou wilt be maintained like a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet indeed: there thou wilt live more securely, and be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained more plentifully; there is King <hi>Vzziah,</hi> alias <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi> that loves such precise ones as thou art, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.1, 3. and a people that prize men of thy straine, and will not suffer thee to want. Thus this mercenary false Prophet measures <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> by himself, thinking that gaine would intice him away, as if <hi>Amos</hi> had been one of those who Prophesied for a little Lucre, for a handful of Barley, or a mouthful of Bread, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.19. <hi>Micha</hi> 3.11. so that this is an Argument <hi>ab utili.</hi>

Thou lovest to be plaine and free against sin, why get thee to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> there they will be glad of thee, and there thou mayest declaime freely against the sins of <hi>Israel,</hi> and threaten us without fear. Here thou art molested with Altars and Calves, with Idols and Images, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.14. but get thee to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and there thou wilt be free from these superstitious fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries, and lying vanities. There exercise thy gift of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and get thy living by it, as I doe by my Priesthoood at <hi>Bethel,</hi> where I live peaceably, and plentifully with my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Sacrifices; I shall not envie thee (get what thou canst at <hi>Iudah</hi>) doe not thou envie me my Morsels at <hi>Bethel.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 General, containing the utter destruction of <hi>Israel,</hi> vers. ult.</p>
               <p>In these two Verses we have <hi>Amos</hi> his answer, wherein he constantly and couragiously maintaines what he had done; and is so farre from desisting or forsaking of his Station, that by an holy Antiperistasis he growes more bold and resolute, confirming what he had spoken against <hi>Israel,</hi> and adding moreover a dreadful Commination against this Arch-Priest for opposing him in the Work of the Lord. He feared not his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Injunctions, and Lordly Prohibition, but boldly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts his Calling, and goes on in the exercise of it, maugre the malice of all opposition whatsoever.</p>
               <p>So that here we have an Implicite reason, why <hi>Amos</hi> durst not desist from Prophecying to <hi>Israel,</hi> viz. because he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led extraordinarily by God to Prophesie unto them. He was no intruder, but a truly called qualified Officer; he did nothing rashly or seditiously, but he seriously and soberly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the duties of that place to which God had so signally called him.</p>
               <p>Now the better to clear his Call (which was the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his comfort and confidence) he first tells us Negatively, what he was not, <hi>I was no Prophet, nor Prophets Son, q. d.</hi> I was no Prophet either by birth or breeding, either by Original or Succession. Some were chosen to be Prophets before they were bred or born, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.5. others among the <hi>Israelites</hi> were Prophets by <hi>succession</hi>; others by <hi>preparation,</hi> were trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up betimes in the knowledge and study of the Scripture; in Colledges and Seminaries of Learning, to supply the wants of the Church. The Prophets that taught them, were called their <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the Scholars were called, <hi>the Sons of the Prophets,</hi> 2 King. 2.3, 7, 15. &amp; 4.38. &amp; 6.1. Mar. 10.24. <hi>Amos</hi> ingenuously confesseth, that he was none of these; hee
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:58817:202"/>
was neither <hi>Nabi,</hi> nor <hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Positively, he tells us plainly what he was, <hi>viz.</hi> an illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate <hi>Herdman</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> dwelling at <hi>Tekoa,</hi> a City in <hi>Iudah,</hi> but extraordinarily called by God, from his Country-calling, of feeding Cattel, to feed his people <hi>Israel</hi> with the Bread of Life, <hi>Amos</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <p>This he mentions not to make his Message contemptible, but to procure the more respect and authority to his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, since he was not called and qualified in an ordinary way, but immediately, and extraordinarily by God himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I was an Herdman</hi>; Such were useful in their kind, they had many of them in those dayes, because their riches lay much in cattel. Their lesser cattel were tended by Shepherds, and their greater by Herdmen,<note place="margin">

               <p>Yet more to magnifie Gods Free-grace, he sets forth his mean condition from which the Lord had called him. He li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a solitary, country life, he was not bred up in Cities, or Academies, but amongst Herds and Stalls, contenting himself with such wild dyet as the Sycamores did afford.<note place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>God often chuseth the weak things of the world to confound the mighty,</hi> and the things that are not (of any esteeme in the world) to confound the things that are of great esteeme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28.</p>
                  <p>He usually hangs the greatest weights upon the weakest wyres, that so his name may have all the praise; if the Lord should alwayes work by excellent Instruments, we should I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolize the Instruments and forget God. Hence the Lord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten passeth by the eloquent Orator, and the learned Scribe, and chuseth an illiterate <hi>Amos,</hi> sending him from the Crib to the Court, to witness against the Idolatry of Princes, Priests, and People.</p>
                  <p>Thus in the Civil State he oft chuseth persons of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to rule his people, as <hi>Moses, Saul, David,</hi> all three cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from their Flocks and Herds to rule his people, <hi>Exo.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.21. &amp; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 113.7.8.

                  <p>It is true, the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and fanatick frantick <hi>Quakers,</hi> doe all pretend to an extraordinary and immediate Call; when upon trial they are found not to have ordinary gifts, they can hardly write or read.</p>

                  <hi>Behold,</hi> which is here an <hi>Eye-Ecee,</hi> though oft in Scripture it be an <hi>Ear-Ecce,</hi> calling upon men to hearken; yet here 'tis an Eye-<hi>Ecce,</hi> and calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to see a Vision, so 'tis used, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.29, 47. This word <hi>Behold,</hi> like the hand in the Margent of a Book, points to some notable thing, and is like the sounding of a Trumpet before some famous proclamation, or the ringing of a Bell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an excellent Sermon.</p>

                  <hi>A basket of Summer fruit. Amos</hi> saw a basket of Summer fruit. After all the Visions means and menaces which the Lord had given them, he adds yet this, <hi>Of a basket of Summer fruit,</hi> if at last he might work upon their hard hearts. By this sacred Hieroglyphick, the Lord typifies the manner of <hi>Israels</hi> end, and shews it to the Prophet in Vision, the better to affect both Prophet and People.
<pb facs="tcp:58817:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>
A basket of Summer fruit is quickly ripe; as the great heat of the Sun doth more speedily ripen fruit, so the great means and mercies which this people did injoy, hastened the maturity of their sin, and made them as the Rod of an Almond-tree. which blossometh before other trees, <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.11, 12.</p>
               <p>When fruit is ripe and gathered, 'tis a sign that Summer is past, and Winter is at hand; so this Vision did shew that the Winter of a final overthrow was nigh to the ten Tribes.</p>
               <p>The word which we render <hi>Basket,</hi> the Vulgar render it, <hi>Uncinus,</hi> an <hi>Hook,</hi> wherewith we get the fruits which are past our reach, from the tops of trees.

                  </note> and admits of divers significations, as <hi>a Basket, a Hook, a Cage</hi>; but most properly it signifies a <hi>Basket</hi>; though there is a truth in all these, for as the Hook, pulls down those Apples which are ripe, with ease, and brings the boughs to our hands; and as ripe fruit in a Basket, or birds in a Cage, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.27. are easily carried whithersoever the owner pleaseth; so the <hi>Israelites</hi> which were ripe for ruine, should be easily and suddenly carried away out of their own Land by the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> as appears, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.</p>

               <p>WEE are now come to the Third Part of this Chapter, where the Judgements of God both Corporal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual are more fully set forth unto us.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Prophet shewes the certainty of these Judgements, in that the Lord doth not only say, but swear that he will bee avenged on them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As they had been great Sinners, so he sets forth the greatness of their Punishment, <hi>It shall overflow the Land like a mighty floud,</hi> vers. 8.</p>

               <p n="5">5 Which strikes all dead, He tells them that this their loss should be irreparable. <hi>They shall fall, and shall never rise any more,</hi> vers. 14. We have heard of <hi>Israels</hi> Sin, now follows his Suffering; and lest any should flatter themselves, and think that these Threatnings were but Scar-crows, therefore the Prophet the better to awaken these secure Sinners, brings in the Lord swearing their destruction, q. d. <hi>So sure as I live, (saith the Lord) so sure shall yee dye.</hi> This Oath of God no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord hereby ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly upbraids them for their ingratitude, that having such glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious priviledges from him, they should yet rebel against him.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>by the excellency of Iacob,</hi> understand the Ark, and others the Temple; it is true, these are called, <hi>The glory of Israel</hi>; but since the Lord hath no greater to swear by, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he swears by himself, who is here called, <hi>The Excellency of Iacob,</hi> i. e. of his people <hi>Israel.</hi>

               </epigraph>
               <p>WEE have seen <hi>Israels</hi> sin and sorrow in part, here we have it more fully amplified. 1. Their prosperity shall be turned into misery, and their mirth into mourning, <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They shall lose their Pastors and their Preaching and shall have a famine of spiritual food sent amongst them, <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then follows utter destruction, <hi>vers.</hi> 13, 14.</p>
               <p>The Prophet Allegorically sets forth under elegant Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors, the greatness of that sorrow which was falling upon <hi>Israel; Their light should be turned into darkness,</hi> their joy into sorrow, their prosperity into adversity, their feasts into mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and their songs into lamentation, as for an only Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Israel</hi> had injoyed a little gleam of prosperity which they thought would alwaies last, they thought this Sun would never set, nor this light ever be darkened, but the Lord tells them, he would suddenly send the Army of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> upon them, when they little dreamed of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that their Sun should set at noon, and the light be turned into sudden darkness.</p>
               <p>Some take the words literally, that the natural Sun should set at noon, but the Prophet speaks not of natural, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical darkness <hi>viz.</hi> of the night of adversity, as appears by that which follows, <hi>I will darken the earth in the clear day,</hi> what's that? why I will turn your feasts into mourning, &amp;c. <hi>vers.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Others apply this Text to the Passion of Christ, when the Sun was eclipsed, and darkness covered the face of the whole earth. But this is quite against the Text and Context, which speaks of the destruction of the Kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> and not of the sufferings of Christ.</p>
               <p>In the verse it self we have 1. A dreadful judgement threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in metaphorical terms, <hi>I will cause your Sun to go down at noon, and will darken the earth in the clear day.</hi> The same
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:58817:223"/>
thing is set forth in various terms, the better to affect them. By <hi>Light and the Sun at noon,</hi> is meant great prosperity and gladness, as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Hest.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Iob</hi> 18.5, 6. &amp; 38.15. <hi>Psal.</hi> 97.11. &amp; 112.4. By <hi>darkness</hi> is meant, great sorrow, terrour, captivity, and fear. So <hi>Iob</hi> 22.10, 11. <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.9, 10. <hi>Ier.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.18. <hi>Micah</hi> 3.6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 107.10. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.2. Hence the doleful condition of the damned in Hell is called by the name of darkness, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is the time when this shall be, and that is, <hi>in that day, viz.</hi> when the Lord shall come to execute judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Israel,</hi> for all their provocations, and bring the Army of their enemies upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here is the certainty of all this misery, <hi>Dixit Dominus,</hi> The Lord, who cannot lye, hath spoken it. Let the wicked have never so much light of prosperity, let him shine as bright as <hi>Lucifer,</hi> yea as the Sun it self, which is the fountain of light, yet his light shall be put out in obscurity, and down he shall, <hi>Ier.</hi> 14.13. The higher men are in their own conceits without God, the more suddenly and surely shall they fall.</p>
               <p>The summe of all is this, <hi>q. d. 'Tis true O yee people of</hi> Israel, <hi>that yee are now at the heighth of your peace, and at the high-noone of your prosperity, now you are secure and flourishing by reason of those victories which you obtained under</hi> Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam <hi>the second,<note place="margin">See my Com. on Hos. 13.16 p. 148.</note> who restored what was lost to</hi> Israel: <hi>now you trust in your Riches, Success, and Armies, and never once think of a fall, or that your Sun will set; but since I have spared you for a time, therefore you conclude that your judgements will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come, but I will bring sudden calamities upon you (saith the Lord) and such as you looked not for, so that your mid-day of prosperity shall be turned into the midnight of adversity; your peace into war, your plenty into penury, and your liberty into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint: you shall be stript of all by the merciless</hi> Assyrian; <hi>and you that were but now the head, shall suddenly be made the heel: The Sun of your prosperity shall set in obscurity, without the least glimmering of light, or hope of deliverarance.</hi>

                  <q>And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your Songs into Lamentation, and I will bring up Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath upon all loyns, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an onely Son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>WHat the Prophet had spoken metaphorically and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the precedent verse, he comes and explains it in this. He had told them before that their Sun should set at noon; what's that, may some one say? why in plain English, <hi>Your feasts shall be turned into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prophet goes on still in setting forth that sudden and sad distress which should surprise <hi>Israel,</hi> and because wicked men are slow of heart to beleeve Gods threatnings, therefore he multiplies words, and expresseth the same thing in various terms, the better to awaken them, and work upon them.</p>
               <p>In the two fore-going verses we had six <hi>Ands,</hi> and in this verse we have six more, which serve as so many links to fasten the chain of Gods judgements together. Where wee have 1. A further explication of the judgement threatned, <hi>viz. a turning of their feasts into mourning, and their songs into la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But the Question will be, what songs and feasts doth the Prophet here speak of, whether be they sacred or prophane?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Both, 1. The Lord would turn their common feasts where they had prophane singing and musick, into weeping and wailing, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their holy Feasts and Temple Songs, and Musick, in which they so much delighted, and thought that with such Ceremonious, external worship God was well pleased, these did but increase Gods wrath, and blow up the fire of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure against them, and therefore the Lord threatens that these songs especially should be turned into howling, <hi>vers.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>The Jews had many festivals, and in them God commanded them to rejoyce, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.18. They had also holy Musick, and holy songs at those festivals appointed by <hi>David,</hi> for the prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:58817:224"/>
of God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. But they being Idolaters, Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and hypocritical, resting in a bare external perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of these Ceremonial Rites, and placing all holiness in them, though themselves lived lewdly and licentiously, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.8, 9, 10, 11. Sacrificing to the Calves, and not to God, therefore the Lord threatens to turn even those religious feasts and songs (for of these the Prophet seems more especially to speak) into mourning and lamentation, <hi>q. d. Hitherto you have lived secure and careless, feasting and singing without any fear of God, or thoughts of his judgements; but now (saith the Lord) I will turn your feasting into fasting, and your songs into la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is the greatness of their sorrow, set forth by two Ceremonial Rites, which were used in those Eastern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <hi>viz. Sackcloth and Baldness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sackcloth</hi> was a course mourning garment, made of black Goats hair, bound with a girdle about their loyns. 'Twas a sign and symbole of misery and mourning,<note place="margin">See more in Mr. <hi>Greenhill</hi> on Ezek. 7.18.</note> as appears, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.34. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.30. <hi>Psal.</hi> 30.11. <hi>Isa.</hi> 3.24. &amp; 25.3. &amp; 22.12. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.8. &amp; 48.37. <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.18.<hi>Ioel.</hi> 1.8. At <hi>Abners</hi> funeral <hi>David</hi> commanded them to put on Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and weep, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.31. And <hi>Ahab</hi> hearing of Gods judgements coming on him, he humbled himself in <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.27. The two witnesses were cloathed in Sackcloth, mourning to see so many fall away to Popery, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. The Lord threatens to make them put off their ornaments and gorgeous attire, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.4, 5. and put on sackcloth and mourning weeds, as most suitable to such mournful times. They would not humble themselves nor mourn in their pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, now they should be humbled, and made to mourn in their adversity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Baldness</hi> also was a sign of the greatest mourning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, and therefore the Lord threatens here that he would bring <hi>baldness upon every head,</hi> that is, their miseries should be so great, that they should pluck off the very hair of their heads for anguish and sorrow: for the Jews, when they were in deep distress, did testifie their sorrow, as by sackcloth and renting their garments; so by Baldness also, either pulling the hair off their heads for very anguish and indignation, as <hi>Ezra</hi> did <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.3. or else shaving their heads and beards,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:58817:225"/>
as <hi>Iob</hi> did when he heard that his children were dead; this he did, not out of impatience, but according to the custome of those times and Countries, to express the greatness of his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.20. So <hi>Isa.</hi> 3.24. &amp; 15.2. <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.29. &amp; 16.6. &amp; 47.5. and 48.37. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.18. and 27.31. <hi>Micah</hi> 1.16. The hair of the head and beard is counted an Ornament, and the cutting it off was a debasement, and therefore it was used onely in cases of very great sorrow. Though they might not conform themselves to the Heathen, who shaved their heads, and then dedicated their locks to Idols, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.27, 28. <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.1. yet in sorrow for sin, and deep distress, it was commanded, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Micah</hi> 1.16.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here is the universality of this calamity, it shall seize upon <hi>all loyns and every head,</hi> none shall escape, but as all had sinned, so all should now suffer for sin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here is a further Amplification of their sorrow, drawn from the Example of one that mourns <hi>for the death of an onely Son,</hi> which is wont to be very bitter and great. The Prophet seems to be at a stand, as here, whence to borrow compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to set forth the greatness of their sorrow. A Father which hath many children, disperseth his love among them all, but he that hath but one onely Son, his love is united, and is more vehemently set upon him: hence <hi>Unice amare est vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter amare,</hi> and the Philosopher saith, the strongest love is between two, not twenty; for if it be divided amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, 'tis, lessened and weakened; as a River that is cut into many channels. When Parents lose one of many, it troubles them, but yet they comfort themselves that they have others left still, but if they have but one only Son, and he dye, to bury all their hopes in one onely hopeful childe, is very bitter, and causeth great lamentation. Hence great sorrow in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is thrice compared to the <hi>sorrowing for an onely Son.</hi> 1. In the Text, then <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.26. where the Prophet calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people, to make most bitter lamentation for the great calamities which were coming on them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee calls on them to <hi>mourn as for an onely Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. When the Jews shall be converted and called, 'tis said, <hi>They shall look upon him whom they have pierced, by an eye of Faith, and thou shall mourn for him as for an only Son,</hi> that is, in an high degree and measure. 'Tis a kinde

                  </note> Hence that of Tully, I mourn (said he) for the misery of the Common-wealth, as a Mother doth for her only Son.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Here is the duration of this misery, it shall endure to the end of the Kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> and extend itself to their posterity. <hi>The end thereof,</hi> viz. of the Land, which is put for the inhabitants of the Land, by a frequent Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Prophet seems to prevent an evasion, and stop a gap at which impenitent sinners are wont to creep out; oh (say they) though these troubles be sharp, yet they will be but short, they are clouds that will soon vanish; but deceive not your selves (saith the Prophet) for the VVrath of God shall abide upon you, and upon your Posterity even to the end; and when one wave is over, another shall come, till it have swept you all out of your owne Land.</p>

                     <p>Behold, the days come saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the Land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THe Prophet had before set forth those sad Calamities, and external Miseries which should seize upon the ten Tribes; be now proceeds, and fore-tells them of farre greater evils which should come upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> not a famine of bodily bread (for of that he had spoken before, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.6.) but a Spiritual famine of the Word of God, which should feed their souls to eternal life: This is the Judgement of Judgements, usually the last and sorest. As the giving of Gods VVord to a People is the choysest Blessing, so the taking of it away is the heaviest Curse; as having all other Curses attending it. It is a sign of Gods rejecting and reprobating of a people, when he will not vouchsafe to speak unto them by his Ministers. As it is a sign that God hath some people in that place to which hee sends his Messengers, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.9, 10, 11. so their departure from a place and people is an evident sign of his displeasure against them, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46 <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.14.15.</p>
               <p>In this Verse we have, 1. A note of Attention, <hi>Behold, q. d.</hi> I shall now tell you of a more direful and dreadful Judgement than ever, and therefore it concerns you dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to attend.</p>

external, corporal famine, 'tis not a famine of material bread, but which is far worse, 'tis a spiritual famine, a losse of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly food, a want of the bread of life; this famine should be so great, that they should run from Sea to Sea, and from one part of the Land to another, and yet should not injoy it. The Lord in great mercy had sent his Prophets amongst them, to call them to repentance, but they like ungrateful and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious sinners contemned Gods Ordinances, prophaned his holy things, and persecuted his Messengers, till the wrath of the Lord broke forth, and there was no remedy.</p>
               <p>They loathed Gods Mannah, and longed to be at their Garlick and Onions in <hi>Egypt</hi> again. They were dead under lively Oracles, and barren under fruitful means of grace, and therefore the Lord was now resolved no longer to plow such Rocks, nor sow such sands; but since they would not serve him with gladness of heart in the abundance of all things, therefore they should now be made to serve their enemies in the want of all things. They that would not hear and obey the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of God in their own Land, should now be ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As God had before exalted them to Heaven in the use of means, and given them many excellent Prophets that did fully and faithfully dispense his Word unto them; so now, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets should be taken from them, and they should have a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual famine, and be made to know the price of Gods mercies by the wanting of them. The word <hi>Famine,</hi> implies two things, 1. It sets forth the nature of Gods Word, 'tis the food of the soul. Look what bread and water is to the body, that, and much more is the Word of God unto the soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It imports the greatness of the judgement, it should be a <hi>Famine,</hi> not a famine of bread, that is but a petty-judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a flea-biting, as nothing comparatively to this; though the bodily famine simply considered in it self, be one of Gods sore judgements, as I have shewed before, on <hi>Amos</hi> 4.6. yet that pincheth but the out-side, the carkass, and may bee sent in mercy to the soul: but this famine of the Word is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual judgement that destroies the soul, and is a sign of Gods greatest wrath against a people, and is usually accompanied with many other judgements.</p>

               <p>IN this verse we have a further aggravation of this peoples misery, <hi>viz.</hi> that they should seek what they had despised, and withall they should have a frustration of their expectation. They had contemned the Word of the Lord, and now God in his just judgement will make them know the worth of his Word by the wanting of it. <hi>They shall wander from Sea to Sea.</hi> They shall trouble themselves without any profit. They hated the light, and therefore now they shall sit in darkness; they contemned Gods Prophets, and now they shall not be troubled with them; formerly God sent in his Prophets, rising early to seek them, but now since by their sins they had driven both God and his Prophets from them, they should run from Sea to Sea, that is, from the Red Sea Southward, to the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean Sea VVestward (which were the bounds of the Land of <hi>Canaan, Numb.</hi> 34.3. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.20. <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.10.)

                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:58817:231"/>Q. <hi>Here a Question will arise, Hath not the Lord promised, that those that ask shall have, and they that seek shall find, and such as hunger and thirst shall be blessed, how comes it then to passe, that this people seek the Word of the Lord, and yet cannot finde it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Answer is easie, there is a two-fold seeking and thirsting.</p>
               <p n="1">1 A seasonable, serious, and sincere seeking after God in his Worship, and to such the Promise runs, that they shall finde, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. God never sayes to the genuine seed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> Seek my face in vain, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.19. This Spiritual hungring and thirsting after the sincere milk of the Word, that we may grow thereby, is an infallible evidence of grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There is a formal, feigned, late seeking of Gods Word, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. only in the time of trouble, when pain oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them; such may seek, but they shall never find: and thus it was with <hi>Israel</hi> here, they sought not the Word out of any love to it, nor yet to be converted by it, but being in trouble, and seeing (when it was too late) what a blessing they had lost, they now howl after it, as those did for bodily food,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Hos.</hi> 7.14. and as <hi>Esau</hi> did for the Birth-right, when it was too late, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.17. So these in a blind, erroneous, distracted manner desired to hear the Word of the Lord from the mouth of the Prophets, not to be instructed by it (for they hated to be reformed) but to get some ease and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from them in their distresse; for the Prophets were wont to mingle comfort with their Threatnings, and to tell the people of God how long their troubles should endure, and when they should end, <hi>Psal.</hi> 74.9. But since the Lord spake to them by his Prophets in their prosperity, and they would not beleeve, that so they might fly from the wrath to come; now they should sink under their burden, and run to and fro for a Prophet of the Lord to comfort them, but they should not have it; for as the Lord called and they would not answer, so they should now cry, and should not be heard, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24 25, 26, 27. so that it is a fallacy to argue thus, All that seek shall find, and all that hunger and thirst are blest.</p>
               <p>But these did seek, therefore they shall find; and these did hunger and thirst after the word, therefore they shall bee blessed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:58817:232"/>The Major must be limited, thus:</p>
               <p>All that seek aright, and all that doe truly hunger and thirst after the Word shall be blessed. But these did seek aright, and did truly hunger and thirst after the Word.</p>
               <p>That is false, for by hunger and thirst here is not meant their hungring after the VVord, but it implies a want of the VVord; as a man that is pined wants food, so in <hi>Israel</hi> there should be a great want of the Prophets to preach the Word unto them.</p>
               <p>Some take the words in an Allegorical, Mystical sense, and apply it to the <hi>Iewes</hi> after they had Crucified Christ, and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Prophets, they should run from place to place to seek the VVord of the Lord, and should not find it. But this is too lax and general, and is against the context, which applies it to the ten Tribes, <hi>vers.</hi> 14.</p>

I took <hi>your Sin,</hi> that is, I took the Molten Calf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you had committed that abominable sin of Idolatry, and burnt it with fire, and the Scripture frequently calls Idols by the name of sin, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.29, 30. <hi>Isa.</hi> 27.9 &amp; 31.7. <hi>Hos.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.8.

               <p n="3">3. He goes on to prove their Idolatry, by their forms of swearing then in use, for our oaths are a kinde of confession of our Faith, whereby we testifie, that hee whom we swear by knows our hearts, and is able to punish us if we swear falsly; hence swearing is frequently put for religious worship. This swearing by Idols, and fictitious Gods (as Idolaters use to do) as if they had no other God to swear by, could not but highly provoke the Lord to cast them off, who thus ungratefully and dis-ingenuously forsook him, the fountain of all their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
               <p>They say, <hi>Thy God O Dan live</hi> or they swear by the life of <hi>Dan,</hi> which yet was a dead Idol, and had no life in it.

            <list>
               <item>1. A <hi>Commination.</hi>
               </item>

               </item>
               <item>3. A <hi>Mitigation or Qualification</hi> of this Commination with Evangelical promises of consolation and restauration. So that this Chapter consists both of Law and Gospel, of judgement and mercy; which is the best mixture that a Prophet of God
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:58817:237"/>
can use, because all ingenuous natures are wrought upon, either by judgements or mercies, and those that neither of these can work upon, are desperate.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Here is a continuation of Gods Commination by way of Type or Vision, wherein we have, 1. The Vision <hi>propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, viz. the smiting of the lintel of the Temple door, that the posts might shake.</hi> Denoting thereby the certainty of their ruine and transportation, without any possibility of escaping.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Vision is <hi>expounded, vers.</hi> 1. where we have 1. The <hi>persons</hi> that shall be cut off, and those are the body of the people, the generality of the Land, both great and small; as all had sinned, so all must now suffer for sin. 1. He commands, <hi>Smite them in the head,</hi> that is, cut off Kings, Princes and Priests, both in <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah.</hi> 2. Rest not there, but <hi>slay the rest of them with the sword,</hi> that is, cut-off the inferiour sort. 3. Here is the certainty and inevitableness of their suffering confirmed by Arguments drawn, first from the Omnipresence of God, no place what ever can protect a sinful people from his revenging hand, and this is set forth 1. Generally, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. <hi>Hee that flyeth, shall not flee away, and hee that escapeth, shall not bee delivered.</hi> There is no escaping when God pursues.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By a notable enumeration of some particular places, shewing that they should not escape though they hid themselves

               <hi>Hee is the Lord God of hosts,</hi> vers. 5. 2. By the effects of his power.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If he but touch the Land, it shall melt,</hi> vers. 5. with a touch he can destroy a Land, and turn it into us first Chaos.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He can bring an overflowing flood upon it, that shall quickly over-run all, <hi>vers.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By his work of Creation, 1. <hi>In Heaven, 'tis hee that builds the stories of Heaven.</hi> By his power and wisdome hee created the Heavens, and the several sphears and regions of the Air, as so many stories one above another, <hi>vers.</hi> 6.</p>

            <p n="5">5. He confirms the certainty of their destruction from the sinfulness of their condition. As first, They were dis-ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ungrateful, whereas he had brought them up out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and made them his <hi>Israel,</hi> yet they beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themselves more <hi>like Ethiopians, than Israelite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they had been like to Heathens in sinning, so now they should be like them in suffering, <hi>vers.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They were very secure and regardless of Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, contemning the warnings of Gods Prophets, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord threatens, that <hi>they should fall by the sword,</hi> vers. 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Prophet having before used <hi>Driving Motives,</hi> drawn from the Judgements of God; comes now to <hi>Drawing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> taken from the mercies and comfortable promises of God. Before he had brought them to Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> the Mount of cursing; but now he brings them to Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> the Mount of Blessing. Before he tried them with legal Menaces, and dreadful Comminations, now he closeth his Prophecy with Gospel-mercies, and Evangelical consolations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He tells them that an elect remnant should be saved in the midst of these calamities, till better daies should come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel. Though the Lord were resolved to punish the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:58817:238"/>
body of that rebellious Nation, yet he would not utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them all, but would preserve some because of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and though they might be fifted, tossed and tried with many afflictions, and go into captivity as well as others; yet not one grain should fall to the ground, nor any one of Gods elect perish eternally, <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is the happy Restauration of the Church in Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-times set forth 1. Under the type of <hi>raising up the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of David which is fallen,</hi> vers. 11. Though the house of <hi>David,</hi> and the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> were sorely shatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and sunk very low by reason of their captivity, and other miseries, which lay upon them; so that they were like a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle fallen down, or a Garden laid open, the fence being broken down; yet in Christ the true heir of <hi>David,</hi> it should in Gospel-times be restored and repaired.</p>
            <p n="3">3. According to the custome of the Prophets in Old-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment times, he prophesieth of the glory and happiness of the Church, which he sets forth by the magnificence and affluence of outward blessings; typifying thereby those spiritual mercies which God would give to the elect remnant after their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He promiseth that the Nations should be subdued under them, and their bounds should be inlarged by taking in the Gentiles in these Gospel-times into communion with them, <hi>vers.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Great plenty in their fields and Vineyards, <hi>vers.</hi> 13, 14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Re-edifying of their ruined Cities, <hi>vers.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Returning from captivity and banishment, and re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisment in their own Land, in despight of all their enemies, <hi>vers.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But 'tis impossible, that ever such things should be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To men who are led by sense and carnal reason, these things may seem impossible; but to the Almighty all things are possible. Now 'tis he that undertakes the work, and 'tis he that will effect it in his due time. 'Tis I that will bring them again, and I will plant them in the Land that I have given them, even I will do this, saith the Lord Almighty, who am <hi>Thy God</hi> in covenant with thee.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THe destruction of this people was shadowed out before, by four visions; This is the fifth and last, by which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet confirms that Commination which he had publisht in the precedent chapters.</p>
               <p>The better to confirm the truth and authority of what he should speak, he begins first with his usual Preface, <hi>Amos</hi> 1.1. &amp; 8.1. <hi>I saw the Lord,</hi> the King of Kings, and supream Monarch of all the world, whom <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to wrath with their Idolatry; him, I say, <hi>I saw</hi> in a trance or Prophetical vision, <hi>standing,</hi> which implies two things, 1. That he was ready to depart from this rebellious people,<note place="margin">See <hi>Patrick,</hi> Jewish Hypoc. ch. 9. ss. 8. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>28.</note> his gracious presence should now no longer abide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them. 2. <hi>Stat ut vindex,</hi> he stands ready to pronounce the final sentence against them, and to execute his righteous judgement on them, so <hi>Amos</hi> 7.7. So that here is the Lords posture, <hi>He stands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is the place where he stands, <hi>viz. upon the Altar.</hi> Here two great Questions will arise. 1. How could <hi>Amos</hi> see God, when 'tis said, <hi>No man hath seen God at any time,</hi> and none can see him and live, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.20. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.18. yet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> is said to see God and live?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Answer is easie, There is a twofold seeing of God. 1. As he is in himself in his transcendent glory and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and thus no mortal man cloathed with flesh and blood, and clogged with humane infirmities,<note place="margin">See this point excellently cleared by Dr. <hi>Arrow smith</hi> on John 1.18.</note> can see God and live; it would overwhelm him, and he could not bear it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. 1 <hi>Ioh</hi> 4.12. but in the life to come we shall see him clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a seeing of him in this life darkly, in his word and works, and visionarily, by visions, external apparitions, signs and sights; such as our infirmities will bear; and thus he appeared to <hi>Amos,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Isaiah, chap.</hi> 6.1. Ezek. 1.1. &amp; 43.3, 4. <hi>Daniel</hi> and others. These saw the Lord in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, but not in his Essence.</p>
               <p>A second Quere is, <hi>What is meant by the Altar here</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="511" facs="tcp:58817:239"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Here Interpreters are divided. Some conceive that <hi>Amos</hi> living at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and being sent to preach principally to the ten Tribes, saw the Lord standing upon some Idolatrous Altar, at <hi>Dan</hi> or <hi>Bethel</hi> (not by way of approbation, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending its destruction) as ready to do execution there, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Altar, and its worshippers. But 'tis probable, that the Lord would not so far countenance those Idolatrous places, as to shew any vision, or utter any Oracle there, where the Devil was worshipped, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.15.</p>
               <p>Others upon better grounds, do interpret it of Gods stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Brazen Altar, which was in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> which being without the Temple in the Inner Court, may intimate Gods beginning to forsake his Temple and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that there was no hope of pardon left, seeing the place of propitiation was by God converted into a sear of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, he standing upon the Altar of burnt-offerings, as it were to slay the men of those times, whose provocations he could no longer bear; and albeit the Prophet was principally sent to <hi>Israel,</hi> yet he many times takes in <hi>Iudah</hi> with them (as I have shewed on <hi>Amos</hi> 6.1.) As both had sinned, so both must suffer, and be laid in the dust; neither should their Temple in which <hi>Iudah</hi> so much gloried, any whit avail them in the day of Gods wrath; much less should those Idol and prophane Temples of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> any whit avail <hi>Israel,</hi> which God never commanded to be built, but alwaies abhorred as dens of Devils, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.15.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here is the <hi>Vision it self, viz.</hi> the destruction of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> set forth by the smiting of the Lintel of the door, that the posts might shake; <hi>And he said, Smite the lintel of the door, &amp;c.</hi> The question will be, whom doth the Lord here speak to when he sayes, <hi>smite?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Some conceive that he speaks to the Prophet, who was commanded to denounce judgements against them, that all might quake for fear. Others conceive that he means <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who burnt the Temple, and smo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e the Altar. Others apply it to <hi>Salmaneser</hi> the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> who executed Gods wrath upon <hi>Israel,</hi> carried them into captivity, and destroyed their Idol-Temples. These are but conjectures.</p>
               <p>Most conceive that it was some <hi>Angel</hi> which the Lord had
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:58817:240"/>
appointed as the executioner of this Judgement upon this people; hence we so often read in Scripture that God made use of Angels for such ends.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Here is the work that this Angel must do. <hi>Hee must smite the lintel of the door of the Temple</hi>; The gate of the Temple had a threshold and posts, and over the threshold in the frontispeece was elegant work, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.33, 34, 35.</p>

                  </note>By the <hi>Lintel</hi> here is meant the Transome, or Head-peece over the door, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.22.

               <p n="6">6. Here is the manner, how the Angel must smite the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, not faintly and feebly, but with vehemency and courage, so that the posts and pillars may shake again. By the lintel is meant the Superiours, and by the posts which supported it, the Inferiours; all should be smitten, and made to quake again for fear; for so it follows, <hi>Cut them in the head all of them</hi>; where we have the <hi>Persons</hi> which the Angel must smite, and those are, 1. The <hi>Heads of Israel,</hi> that is, the Rulers Eccse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical and Civil. Cut them in the head, or cut them which are the head of all, <hi>viz.</hi> the chief and principal men in Church and State, both Princes and Priest.

               <p>THese Apostatizing Israelites being puft up with their Priviledges, conceiting that God loved them, because he had given them some success and victories; hereupon they grew secure and impenitent, promising themselves impunity in their sins, which makes the Prophet here to thunder out Gods dreadful judgements against them with vehemency and variety of words, and to use very lofty and hyperbolical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, the better to awaken them, and drive them out of their vain conceits. In the end of the fore-going verse he had shewed them, that <hi>though they fled, yet they should not escape</hi>; and this he proves in the three following verses, by a notable enumeration of five particular places, thereby shewing them that they should not escape, though they hid themselves

The first means whereby they thought to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from Gods revenging hand, was by digging and <hi>taking great pains</hi> to hide themselves as low as Hell. We have the same word used, <hi>Ionah</hi> 1.13. where the Mariners are said to row hard, to save <hi>Ionah,</hi> the word is <hi>Iachteru,</hi> they digged in the Sea by rowing, that is, they used the utmost means to save him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Some take the words literally, thus, If it were possible for these incorrigible sinners to descend into Hell, or ascend up into Heaven, yet Gods hand of Justice should finde them out in the one, and cast them out of the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Let <hi>Adam</hi> hide himself amongst the trees, and <hi>Ionah</hi> lye never so close to the sides of the ship, yet Gods Almighty hand found out both the one and the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this will not do, and Hell will afford no help, they'l climbe <hi>to Heaven,</hi> and try what that will do, but all in vain; for thence will God cast them down, that the <hi>Assyrian</hi> may slay them.

Having therefore shewed them that Heaven and Hell could afford them no security, he comes now to stop a third gap, by which they might think to escape, <hi>viz.</hi> by flying to Rocks, and inaccessible Mountains.

               <p>There were two <hi>Carmels.</hi> The one was in <hi>Iudea,</hi> as appears, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 15.55. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.2. the other in the Text was an high, pleasant, fruitful Mountain in <hi>Canaan,</hi> good for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturage, and therefore is used in Sripture sometimes <hi>Largely,</hi> for any fertile place; so <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.17. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Amos</hi> 1.2.

               <p>WE have done with the Commination, we are now come to the second general part of the Chapter, and that is <hi>the confirmation of the Commination,</hi> which is drawn from the Omnipotent Majesty and Power of God, who is Lord Paramount of all the world, the glorious Creator and Governour of all. All depend upon him, and observe his beck, what he sayes it is done (<hi>ejus dicere est facere</hi>) and what he threatens is as easily and speedily effected.</p>
               <p>The better therefore to awaken these drousie sinners, and make them fear, the Prophet here sets forth the Majesty and Power of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they might see there was no contending with him, and that he was able, and would certainly bring to pass what ever he had threatned against them. To this end we often finde <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets setting forth the Majesty of God by his Titles &amp; Works, as that he <hi>is the Mighty God, the Lord of Hosts, the King of Kings, &amp;c.</hi> Sinners are hardly drawn to consider the Glory and Majesty of that God with whom they have to do, and therefore the Prophet so oft toucheth on this string, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6.8. and 4. <hi>ult.</hi> and 5.8, 9.</p>
               <p>In this Verse, and the next, we have an elegant description of Gods Power and Glory (where every word hath its weight) And that 1 By his Names and Titles, He is <hi>the Lord,</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, the Creator and Preserver of all things; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:58817:248"/>
his Threatnings ought not to be contemned.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He is <hi>the Lord of Hosts,</hi> he hath the superiour and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Armies of Heaven and Earth, of Sea and Land, as it were horse and foot to march against his enemies.</p>
               <p n="3">3 His Almighty <hi>Works</hi> set forth his Majesty and Power. 1 The <hi>Earth</hi> which is in it self a most solid, firm, hard, immoveable body, yet acknowledgeth the Power and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of its Almighty Lord and Creator; and therefore if he do but touch it (at least with any of his rods, and in displeasure) it presently melts like wax before the fire,<note place="margin">

                  </note> or snow before the Sun. 2 If he be provoked to anger, he can make a sinful land to mourn, by bringing upon them the punishment due to them for their sins; he can make both things and persons melt. Therefore fear to offend him; this must be annexed to every branch of this description of God, <hi>e. g.</hi> He is Jehovah the Lord of Hosts, therefore fear him. He makes the earth to melt, and the inhabitants thereof to tremble, therefore do you humble your selves before him. 3 If all this will not work upon you, yet consider he can drown you, and make his floods to go over all the land, as he did in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, and as he doth in many Islands, and other places at this day. See before Chap. 8.8.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If ye will not fear him for his Majesty, and Power that appears on earth, then look up to the <hi>heavens,</hi> vers. 6. and see his Wisdome and Power there, in creating the several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the air, as so many stories one above another, besides the variety of creatures which he hath on earth, as so many Troops ready prest to do him service; and his sending of the waters of the Sea upon the earth, either by rain, or inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to punish it. These all shew the Power and Glory of that God with whom we have to do, and therefore should make us fear to offend him, and speedily to make our peace with him.</p>
               <p>The summe of all is this, <hi>Hitherto ye have trusted in your own strength and priviledges, and have set light by Gods Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, as if they had been but so many scar-crows; but now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, O ye infirm, and sinful dust and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>He calleth for the waters of the Sea, and poureth them out on the face of the Earth.</q>
               <p>Here is a third thing wherein the All-mighty Power of God appears, and that is in the generating of rain. By the heat of the Sun he draws up vapours out of the Salt-Sea, into the middle Region of the Aire, where they condense into clouds, and then dissolves them into showers of fresh water for the use and service of man.</p>
               <p>He calls for the waters of the Sea, either for Inundation, as (some conceive) to overflow a Land, <hi>q. d.</hi> 'tis the Lord, that by his command lets loose the waters of the Sea to destroy his enemies. But most genuinely it is applied to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Rain. He calls for the waters out of the Sea into the upper Region of the Air by the Sun beams, that he may powre them down again upon the face of the Earth. See the same expression before, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.8.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, the Rain is generated by Vapours that ascend out of the Earth, yet because the Sea doth concur with its Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:58817:251" rendition="simple:additions"/>
also, therefore the generation of the Rain is likewise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to it; and herein also the All-mighty Power of God is seen, that can at a beck call for the Rain, and suddenly the clouds cover the face of the heavens over our heads; this shews the incomparable Power of God, that can in a trice make such a change.</p>
               <p>Lastly, If you desire to know who 'tis that doth all those great and glorious things, I will tell you in a word, <hi>'Tis the great Iehovah, that is his Name.</hi> This is the most proper Name of God (as I have shewed before, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi>) and notes his eternal essence, who gives being to all things, and to you, O Israelites, amongst the rest, and therefore there is no hiding your selves from him, nor dallying with him who is All-migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hath his Troops in Heaven, in Earth, and in the Sea against you.</p>

               <p>In this Verse the Prophet by a Prolepsis prevents two Objections. 1 Whereas they boasted that they were Gods people in Covenant, and descended of holy Progenitors, and therefore God would not destroy them.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> To this the Prophet answers, that in their wayes

The <hi>Ethiopians</hi> were a vile, accursed Nation, the symbole of servitude, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.25. <hi>Cursed be</hi> Cham, <hi>a servant of servants, i. e.</hi> a most vile slave let him be. Now from this <hi>Cham</hi> came <hi>Canaan</hi> and his brother <hi>Chus,</hi> who was the father of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians</hi>; hence they are called <hi>Chusiim</hi> (as in the Text) from <hi>Cham</hi> and <hi>Chus,</hi> Gen. 10.6.</p>
               <p>The Interrogation is a strong Affirmation, <hi>Are ye not as the children of the</hi> Ethiopian <hi>to me? q. d.</hi> Ye are so, there is an emphasis in that word <hi>mihi,</hi> to me, <hi>q. d.</hi> though ye excell other Nations in many priviledges, and are honoured by men, yet when you come before me, what can you bring that is not mine? all your feathers and favours are but borrowed, and when I have taken mine own from you, wherein are you better to me than <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> or the most vile and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Nation in the world? In respect of Creation, and by nature we are all alike, both Saints and <hi>Scythians, Israelites,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> we all come out of the same corrupt mass, it is onely free-grace which makes the difference; and therefore the more God had done for <hi>Israel,</hi> the more humble and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient they should have been. But since they forgat the God of their mercies, despised the counsel of his Prophets, and hardened themselves in their sins, the Lord tells them in plain termes, that now he esteemed them no more than the most base and barbarous Nations in the world; and this the Lord doth to abase them, and make them know themselves who were stuft with such high conceits of themselves, and their priviledges, though they walked clean contrary to them; in which respect they were inferiour to Heathens, who never sinned against such light and love as they had done.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. A second Evasion was this, <hi>The Lord hath chosen us for his own peculiar people, above all the Nations of the world, and hath delivered us from</hi> Egypt, <hi>and brought us into</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It doth not follow, that because you have been delivered out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that therefore you shall go unpunisht for your sin; but the contrary, since you have received such great blessings, therefore you must yeeld answerable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, remembring that they which have much, of them shall be much required; and if they offend, they shall be sooner, and more severely punished, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.12. 2. The Prophet tells them, that they had no reason to be puft up with this deliverance, for the Lord had granted the like external deliverances (though not alike in all circumstances to that of <hi>Egypt</hi>) to Heathenish and Idolatrous people, whom they lookt upon as Dogs and Swine. The Prophet instanceth in two Examples.</p>
               <p>The first is that of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> whom the Lord brought from their slavery in <hi>Caphtor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the Large Annot, on Jer. 47.4.</note> Jer. 47.4.

               <p>The second instance is that of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> whom the Lord brought from <hi>Kir,</hi> where they served other Nations.

                  <q>Behold the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and I will destroy it from off the face of the Earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Iacob, saith the Lord.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THe Prophet goes on in the confirmation of what he had denounced against <hi>Israel,</hi> by an Argument drawn from the Justice of God, who is of purer eyes than to behold ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with the least approbation, and who will not acquit persons or Kingdomes that persevere in their wickednesse.</p>
               <q>Behold the eyes of the Lord are upon the sinful Kingdome to punish and destroy it.</q>
               <p>In the words wee have 1. A note of Attention, <hi>Behold.</hi> 2. The matter to be attended, and that is, 1. A judgement threatned,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mehhal pene, A facie vel à superficie terrae.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>God will destroy Israel from the Superficies, on face of the earth</hi>; that is, he will extinguish their memorial from amongst men, and root them out of the world, so that they shall never have more the face of a Nation upon Earth. The like expression we have, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.15. Warnings could not mend them, now Judgements shall rid the world of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is the reason why the Lord will thus destroy them, and that is, because they are a sinful Kingdome, or (as the words are in the fountain) they are a <hi>sinning Kingdome,</hi> a Kingdome even composed of sin, and drowned in iniquity. A Kingdome that sinned not through weakness, but wilfulness, whose sins were not infirmities, but enormities. They fell not by the violence of temptation, but 'twas their trade to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they were wholly given up to it, both Superiours and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours had for many years been a race of Idolaters, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting obstinately in their wicked waies; no wooing nor war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, no mercy nor menaces could work upon them, they were incorrigible and incurable, and therefore the Lord now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to ease himself of them.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But who is meant here by the sinful Kingdome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Some conceive that by Kingdome here is meant any

sinful Kingdome indefinitely, but I conceive that <hi>Amos</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent more especially to prophesie against the Idolatry of the Kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> doth directly and primarily speak against the Idolatry of the Kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> for Idolatry is called <hi>The sin,</hi> by way of eminency (as I have shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on <hi>Amos</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi>) now <hi>Israel</hi> persevering as in other sins, so especially in this great sin of Idolatry, is here called (<hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachah Hachattaah, Hoc regnum peccans</hi>) this sinful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; the article <hi>Ha</hi> is emphatical, and the Text saith not, Mine eyes are upon a sinful Kingdome indefinitly, but upon <hi>This sinful Kingdome, viz.</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi>; and then secondarily it includes the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> which had deeply cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it self, and not long after they also were carried Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Here is the certainty of the judgement, The <hi>Eyes</hi> of the Lord are intent upon them for this purpose (see Vers. 4. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) he hath set his face in anger against them to destroy them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Here is a mitigation or qualification of the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Yet he will not utterly destroy the house of Iacob,</hi> but in the midst of judgement he will remember mercy; and having purged out the dross, and destroyed the prophane body of the people, and rebellious rout, he will preserve the penitent as a remnant for himself, according to his promise made of old to <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> Lev. 26.40, 41, 42. Though the Lord beat Heathenish Nations to dust, and stock up the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed root and branch; and though <hi>Israel</hi> deserved a total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, yet for his own Name sake, he will not deal so with his Church and chosen, he never utterly destroyes them, but leaves some remnant to praise him, and to shine like lights in the midst of a perverse people; and if he do bring them into Captivity, yet a remnant both of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again, according to that precious promise, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30.3.10. <hi>

                     </gap>o the dayes come that I will bring again the Captivity of my people</hi> Israel <hi>and</hi> Judah, <hi>saith the Lord, and will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess it.</hi> This was fulfilled when a remnant of <hi>Israel</hi> returned out of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and joyning themselves to <hi>Iudah,</hi> came again into the holy Land after the seventy years Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="545" facs="tcp:58817:256"/>It was usual with the Prophets to mollifie their Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings with the intermixture of some Promises, the better to incourage them to return, by giving them some glimpse of acceptance, and hope of mercy: for the Prophet having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uttered hard things against this people, he comes now in the close of all to end his Prophesie with promises of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to a remnant whom God would hide in the midst of their Captivity, till better times should come under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
               <p>Some construe the words Ironically, and make them a confirmation of the punishment, <hi>q. d.</hi> I have punished Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that never had the teaching which you have had, and do you think to go scot-free?</p>
               <p>But this sense seems to be racked. It is better therefore to take the words as they simply import a promise of mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, moderation and favour to a remnant, because of the Covenant, and because of the Elect amongst them, and their Seed, who were to be the Seminary of the Church.</p>
               <p>This is most agreeable to the contexture, and suits best with the next Verse, where the Prophet promiseth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit God be resolved to sift the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> yet the least grain should not fall to the ground;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephes chy, non tamen, vel ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runtamen non totali consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione consumam domum Israelis Chald. Paraph.</hi>
                  </note> and therefore the <hi>Geneva</hi> translation renders it well, <hi>Nevertheless I will not utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the house of Iacob.</hi> Destroying, I will not destroy it, that is, I will not totally destroy the family and stock of <hi>Israel,</hi> but will preserve a remnant for my self, though they be captives in <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Chaldea,</hi> yet as I have brought them in, so I will bring some of them out again, that they may praise me.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Here is the confirmation both of the Commination, and the Consolation. <hi>Dixit Dominus,</hi> the Lord who cannot lye, hath said it, who both can, and will perform what ever he hath spoken.</p>

As his eye is upon the righteous to preserve them, so his eye is upon the wicked to destroy them (as I have shewed before on vers. 4.) As he looks upon the righteous not with a bare look of intuition, but with a look of approbation in order to their assistance to do them good, and to exert his strength for them, so he looks upon the wicked with an eye of indignation for evil, and not for good, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12.</p>
                  <p>When men are given up to sin, and are become hardened and habituated in iniquity (as these were) then judgement is near, <hi>Ier.</hi> 13.23, 24. especially when Kingdomes are defiled with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that wickedness with a witness, that sin with an accent, which truly and properly denominates a Kingdome to be, <hi>The sinful Kingdome.</hi> Where ever this sin goes before, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction is at the heels of it. It is a soul-damning, and a land-destroying sin, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.58. to 63. <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.7, 8, 9. one such a sinner in grain, destroyes much good, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.17. <hi>The Idolater is a grand Traitor to the state he lives in.</hi> He helps to bring Sword, Plague, Famine, and all curses upon a Land, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.7, 8, 21.

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Gods Ministers must wisely intermix Iudgement and Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They must like the good Samaritan, have <hi>Wine and Oyl, Wine</hi> to search and cleanse mens wounds; and <hi>Oyl</hi> to supple and heal them. The sharpness of the Law must be allayed with the sweetness of the Gospel, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.34. <hi>Amos</hi> had often threatned, now he comforts. Obstinate sinners must be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and pulled with violence out of Satans jaws; others that are humbled must be handled gently, <hi>Iude</hi> 23. We must frame our reproofs according to the necessities of our Auditors: All sores are not cured with one salve; that may be poyson to one, which is medicinal to another. The soul must be throughly purged from sin, before it can be cured, or expect any health. It is in this case as it is in sores, if any corruption be left unexpelled, the wound will wrankle, and may become mortal: For sin is like <hi>Bishops-weed,</hi> if you leave but little spangs unweeded, they will run over your garden, and suffer nothing that is good to grow near it. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters then had need to have the Tongue of the Learned, to know how to speak a word in season; for if we preach al mercy,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:58817:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we shall teach men to presume; if all Judgement, to despond and despair. We must therefore wisely sing both of Mercy and Judgement; hence the Prophets did usually give some glimpses of comfort, and grounds of hope to Gods people in their distresse. They had some <hi>peradventure you may be hid and heard,</hi> Joel 2.14. <hi>Ionah</hi> 3.9. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. Take away hope, and you take away endeavours; impossibility of obtaining breaks the heart; and therefore 'tis that the Lord usually gives people some crumbs of comfort in their deepest distresse, that so they might be incouraged to come in unto him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In the midst of Iudgement God usually spares a remnant,</hi> Isa. 1.9. &amp; 37.32. <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.27. &amp; 11.5.</p>

                  <p>God hath many purgatory fires to bring his people thorow. 1. The fire of his Word, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.14. &amp; 23.29. 2. The fire of afflictions and persecutions, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12. and thus every man must be tried by fire, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. 3. If none of these fires will mend men, then comes the fire of the last Judgement, and consumes them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30.33.</p>
                  <p>All that look for salvation, must look for sifting; thorow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tribulations, we must come into Gods Kingdome, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. The better any man is, the more trials he must look for. The more grace, the more sifting; as we see in <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iob, David, Paul, Peter, Luke,</hi> 22.32. The Devil shoots his Arrows at the whitest marks. This spiritual Pyrate sets upon the laden Merchant. The Devil knows that the fall of one of these will more advantage his Kingdome, than the fall of a thousand others; and therefore he saies to his Agents, as the King of <hi>Syria</hi> said to his Captains, Fight neither with small nor great, but against these spiritual Kings. Men of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent gifts and graces, especially when called to eminent places, as Magistrates, Ministers, Governours, &amp;c. must look for eminent trials.

               </epigraph>
               <p>WEE are now come to the Third and last general part of this Chapter, and that is <hi>consolatory,</hi> containing many precious Promises concerning the Kingdom of Christ, and the restauration and inlargement of the Church in the dayes of the Messiah.</p>
               <p>The Prophet before had been <hi>Minatory,</hi> terrifying them with many dreadful comminations of desolation and utter ruine, for their Apostasie and rebellion; but now (that his Sun might not set in a Cloud) hee concludes all with most sweet Evangelical consolations, for the refreshing of the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Elect under those sad Calamities which for many years they lay under. To this end he assures them, that though all at present were in confusion, and the house of <hi>David</hi> lay in the dust; yet the Lord who usually brings l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght out of darkness, and comfort out of discomfort, would in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion restore the Kingdom unto <hi>Israel,</hi> and make up all their losses in a better kind with spiritual blessings.</p>
               <p>And this was the frequent practice of the Prophets, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixe comforts with their Threatnings; the very first Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was pronounced against fallen man, was allayed with a Promise presently annexed.</p>
               <p n="1">1 They used to awaken and humble their Hearers with terrours and threatnings, and then to raise them up again with consolations, especially with the promises of the Messiah, who was the salvation and consolation of <hi>Israel,</hi> yea the joy and desire of all Nations, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.8. in whom all the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were ratified and confirmed. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.</p>
               <p>Both <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> were falling into a very forlorn, scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, sad condition; the Prophet therefore to keep the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongst them from sinking into utter despair, comforts them with this, that in the midst of judgement God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member mercy, being ever mindful of his Covenant, and
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:58817:262" rendition="simple:additions"/>
though he punisht them for their transgressions, yet in due time he would send the Messiah with healing under his wings mongst them.</p>
               <p>Some goe about to confine this glorious Prophesie to <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiahs</hi> time, when <hi>Senacherib</hi> and his Host was slain.</p>
               <p>Others refer it to the times when <hi>Iudah</hi> returned out of their Babylonish Captivity, in the reign of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> when they repaired the ruines of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But the text is clear against this, for those were but poor, sleight, slender restaurations comparatively with this. For 1. but a remnant came out of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, and those poor and low, and farre fewer of <hi>Israel</hi> returned out of <hi>Assyria.</hi> But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration here spoken of is most ample and glorious, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by those high and Hyperbolical expressions of <hi>possessing all Nations, and the Mountains dropping wine, and the Hills run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with Milk and Honey, and all</hi> Israel <hi>returning out of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore confest by all (even by some of the <hi>Iewes</hi> themselves) that these Promises have relation to Christ, and should be fulfilled in Gospel-times, according to that Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical allegation, and interpretation of this very Text by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in the Synod at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Acts 15.16, 17. <hi>After this I will return, and build again the Tabernacle of David which is fallen down</hi>; that is, the Church of God, in which Christ the Son of <hi>David</hi> should dwell and reign, it should be repaired and restored by the Messias, and <hi>I will build again the ruines thereof, viz.</hi> by planting in it the beleeving <hi>Iewes,</hi> and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as living stones, in the stead of the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Jewes, <hi>That the residue of men may seek the Lord</hi>; that is not only the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but all other Nations.

               <p>In these five last Verses of this Chapter, we have a notable Prophesie of glorious things to come, and a cluster of precious Promises, no lesse than five.</p>

                  <hi>That these promises of temporal blessings must be understood Spiritually</hi>; they must not be taken literally for the setting up of any earthly, external, pompous Kingdome in the Posterity of <hi>David,</hi> such a one as the <hi>Iewes</hi> look for, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.6. and the <hi>Millenarians</hi> fancy to themselves, who take this Text in the Letter for building of fine Houses, and plenty of Corn and Wine, and delighting themselves with the Quintessence of the Creature; whereas it is usual with the Prophets in the Old Testament, to shadow forth Spiritual blessings by Temporal things; and this the Lord did the better to work upon the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who were a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, rude, rugged people, and not so easily wrought upon by Spiritual blessings, as by Temporal and visible ones; so that as the Legal threatnings were usually of Temporal Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (though they comprehended Spiritual ones also) <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.16, 17, 18, &amp;c. so the Promises under the Law were usually of Temporal blessings, though they included Spiritual ones also. But the Gospel proclaims Spiritual mercies, which are more noble and divine for though peace and plenty are the Concomitants of the Gospel, yet these are poor uncertaine things, compared with Covenant-Mercies, which are called <hi>sure Mercies,</hi> Isa. 55.3. Besides, Christs Kingdome is not of this world, his Kingdome is not meat and drink, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. but it is a Spiritual kingdome, and so must be taken here. This Kingdome Christ will restore when he shall gather his Church out of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in which Church there shall bee greater glory, than ever <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomon</hi> had, though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of outward splendor it be lesse, yet in respect of inward glory, it shall excel, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.9.</p>

               <p>And thus the house of <hi>David</hi> say in its ruines (being shrunk

from <hi>David</hi> the King, to <hi>Ioseph</hi> the Carpenter) till Christ the Son of <hi>David</hi> came who repaired the breaches, and fulfilled the Prophesies. Then <hi>in that day,</hi> and <hi>at that time</hi> when all seemed to be gone, and all Human help failed, the Lord who loves to be seen in the Mount, sent the Messiah to raise up this Tabernacle of <hi>David</hi> which was fallen, and make it more illustrious than ever; yet not in Temporals, but which is more glorious and divine, in Spirituals; inlarging the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches dominion over all Nations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. and changing that earthly Kingdom of <hi>David,</hi> into a Spiritual and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdom, according to that promise; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.16.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But why is this restauration of all by Christ called, the raising up of the Tabernacle of</hi> David?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For two reasons; 1. Because the Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> was Typical, as <hi>David</hi> himself was a Type of Christ, so his Temporal Kingdom typified and prefigured Christs Spiritual Kingdom. 2. Christ was the Son of <hi>David</hi> according to the flesh, now the Kingdom was promised to <hi>David</hi> and his Seed for ever, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.17. hence Christ is so oft called, <hi>David, Ier.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 37.14. <hi>Hos.</hi> 3.5.</p>

Lam. 3.7.</note>I will make up the gaps of the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>hedge</hi> and wall up the breaches of it, by causing the Gospel to be preached over all the World, which will quickly close up all the ruptures, and make up all the ruines which Sin and Satan hath made; and chase away all those Traditions of men which false Prophets had brought into the Church of God. This began to bee accomplisht when Christ began to preach, and his Apostles after him, as when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> preaching to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> converted them, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.7, &amp;c. and it is daily accomplishing by the inlargement of the Church, but a more full accomplishment hereof will be when the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> shall be called, and united together under Christ their Head.</p>
               <q>And I will raise up his ruines.</q>
               <p>All its Batteries and Breakings, all its Rubbish and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines shall be repaired by Christ still. Wee see (as hath been shewed before) how low the house of <hi>David</hi> was sunk;
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:58817:265"/>
it was like a poor Tent or Cottage, ruinous and full of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and to a carnal eye irrecoverable and past hope.</p>

               <p>When it was in its most flourishing and prosperous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in those purer times of <hi>David,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> reign, when they were free from Superstition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, serving the Lord in simplicity and singleness of heart.</p>
               <p>The summe of all is this; <hi>In that day of</hi> Jacobs <hi>deep distress, I will raise up my Evangelical Church, which is the Tabernacle of the true and glorious Son of</hi> David, <hi>the Messias of the World, even upon the ruines of the Iewish Church, which I will repair, and so make up the Spiritual breaches thereof, as that both</hi> Jewes <hi>and</hi> Gentiles <hi>shall make up one Church, which shall be made as Spiritually compleat as ever the Temple was materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of old.</hi>

                  <p>The Church was glorious of old in <hi>Davids</hi> time, when men went by troops to the House of God, and fled as the Clouds, and flockt as the Doves unto their windows. But the Spiritual glory of the Church in the dayes of the Gospel is farre more glorious than in the dayes of <hi>Israel</hi> of old. They had but the shadow, we have the substance; they saw Christ but darkly in Types and Figures, but we see him with open face. Hence the glory of the latter Temple is said to be greater than the glory of the former, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.9. But how can that be, since the glory of the first Temple was farre more excellent for buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding than the latter? insomuch that the ancient now wept to see how farre short it came of the former. I, but the glory of this latter House (though inferiour for structure) yet shall be greater than the glory of the former, because Christ the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah should personally appear there; and from thence should the Gospel of peace goe forth into all the world, which should work a true and blessed tranquillity in the hearts of all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.

Let us then bless the Lord for Gospel-priviledges, keeping them in purity and simplicity, for though in Old Testament-times God allowed them Musick in publick Services, with Altars, Holy Vestments, &amp;c. yet Christ their substance being come, these shadowes are gone, and now Christ will demand, <hi>Who required these things at

               <epigraph>
                  <q>Behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that the Flow-man shall overtake the Reaper, and the treader of Grapes him that soweth seed, and the Mountains shall drop sweet Wine, and all the Hills shall melt.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>MAn by nature is a very froward, pettish, perverse Peece, especially when under the crosse, God hath much adoe to fasten any comfort on us. When <hi>Israel</hi> lay in deep distress in Aegyptian bondage, they hearkned not to <hi>Moses</hi> because of the anguish of their spirits, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.9. they were so opprest with sorrow that they could not mind what <hi>Moses</hi> said, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve any thing that was spoken concerning their deliverance, as deeming their deliverance desperate and past hope. So this People having laine long in Babylonish Captivity: and after that tired out with many troubles, the Lord here heaps up Promise upon Promise, to assure them of better times at hand. In this Verse we have a third Promise, where the Holy Ghost by the abundance of external and corporal blessings, doth sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow forth unto us the great plenty of <hi>Spiritual gifts,</hi> which should be poured out in Gospel-times; yet since Piety hath the promise of the blessings of this life as well as of that to come, and temporal blessings doe oft attend the Gospel, and God hath promised, that if we first seek his Kingdom, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things shall be cast upon us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. we may take the words in the largest sense, as a promise both of Temporal and Spiritual blessings, which should be poured out upon the Church in Gospel-times.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Spiritual blessings are promised absolutely and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, they being necessary <hi>per se</hi>; but Temporal blessings are promised as accessories only conditionally, with exception of the Crosse, and so farre as they shall be good for us. Things necessary we are sure of, and if more may doe us good wee shall not want it.</p>
               <p>Though both are promised here, yet <hi>Spiritual</hi> blessings are specially intended, as will appear by these reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1 If we look into those Primitive times, when these Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual gifts here promised were poured out abundantly, the
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:58817:269"/>
Church was low in Temporals, though rich in Spirituals, they were Persecuted and Plundered of all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. besides, the Gospel calls for Self-denial, and a contempt of all these low injoyments.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In Old Testament times the Church was in its Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and therefore <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets by such expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions did condescend to the capacity of the rude, and infirme Jewish people, which were as Children under the rudiments of the Law, and spake to them as we use to doe to our little children in their owne Language, when we make promises to them. Hence we read so frequently in the Old Testament of heavenly things shadowed forth unto us by Feasts, and other Temporal blessings, <hi>Isa.</hi> 25.6. and Earthly peace typifying Spiritual peace, and plenty of Corn and Wine, plenty of Grace, as here in the text. By all those Temporal things the Lord would raise up our hearts to the contemplation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and eternal things.</p>
               <p>In the words we have, 1. <hi>A Blessing promised,</hi> and that is, a glorious affluence and abundance of all things, set forth in Hyperbolical terms, and very lofty expressions. As,

                     <item>2 The Treader of Grapes him that soweth the feed.</item>
                     <item>3 The Mountains should drop Wine.</item>
                     <item>4 If this be not enough, all the Hills shall melt, and dissolve into Milk, Honey, Oyl.</item>

               </p>
               <p>All figurative promises of Spiritual Graces and Blessings in Gospel-times.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Here is the <hi>Time</hi> when all this shall be effected, and that is in Gospel-times, set forth in those general terms, <hi>The dayes shall come, viz.</hi> when the Tabernacle of <hi>David</hi> shall be built, and the Kingdom of Christ be raised up.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Here is the confirmation of all this, <hi>Dixit Dominus, The Lord hath said it.</hi>

                  </note> the Plow-man will be at your heels to prepare the ground for another crop. Such plenty there should be, that they should scarce have time enough to gather it in, for before the Harvest was in, it should be time to Plow, and the Vintage should reach unto the seed time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the treader of Grapes him that soweth the seed</hi>: Or draweth forth the seed, <hi>viz.</hi> out of his Sack to sow, <hi>q. d.</hi> The Vintage shall be so plentiful that it shall last even till seed time; so that when you should be sowing, you shall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of grapes; yea such plenty shall there be of all things, that when one kind of fruit is ripe, another shall follow, every one in his due course and order.</p>
               <p>A Parallel place we have, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.5. to which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet seems to allude, where we have the same Blessings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised almost in expresse terms, <hi>Your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time, q. d.</hi> you shall have such plentiful Harvests, that before you can have threshed out your Corn, the Vintage shall come; and such rich Vintages, that before they be ended, it shall bee time to sow your seed; so that you shall have one blessing in the neck of another, you shall alwayes be getting and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fruit, there shall be no time wherein the earth shall not be yeelding you somewhat, either for necessity or delight.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="573" facs="tcp:58817:270"/>
                  <hi>And all the Hills shall melt</hi>; that is, they shall seeme to doe so, by reason of the abundant increase of Milk, Oyl, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, &amp;c. as if they flowed with them. The Hills shall flow with Milk (saith <hi>Ioel</hi>) that is, they shall so abound with Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Bees, Vines, and Olives, that Milk, Honey, Wine, and Oyl, shall as it were flow from the Hills, and though they be high and hard, yet now they shall all dissolve into moysture, and be made fit for culture.</p>
               <p>Some Allegorize thus; By <hi>Mountains</hi> they understand the Apostles and Apostolical men, whose Evangelical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was as Wine to comfort disconsolate souls. These plowed and sowed the world with the seed of heavenly Doctrin; and by <hi>Hills</hi> are meant the ordinary Preachers, who had Milk for Babes. Or, the <hi>Mountains</hi> are great men, and the <hi>Hills</hi> the inferiour sort; all these both high and low should in Gospel-times be inricht with gifts and graces. The multitudes of Converts should be so great, that they should keep the Lords Spiritual Husband-men in continual imployment, so that they should alwaies be Plowing, Sowing, Reaping, &amp;c. alwayes Praying, Preaching, Planting, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The summe of all is this, <hi>That in Gospel-times there should be such abundance of blessings, that one should overtake another in a perpetual succession; as it is in a rich and fruitful soyl, where the Harvest is no sooner in, but the Plough is put into the ground for another crop; and the Vintage is no sooner done, but the seed is sowen for a new Harvest. Thus it shall be with the Church, where one blessing endeth, another shall begin, and even the driest and barrenest hearts shall yeeld excellent fruits of grace in great abundance.</hi>

               <epigraph>
                  <q>And I will plant them upon their Land, and they shall no more be pulled up, out of their Land, which I have given them, saith the Lord.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>WEE are now come to the fifth and last Promise, which brancheth it self into two particulars. 1. A Promise of Plantation and Settlement. <hi>I will Plant them in their own Land.</hi> They shall have a settled and sure habitation in the Church Militant here, and in the Church Triumphant hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They shall have establishment, <hi>They shall be no more pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up out of their Land.</hi> This cannot be understood literally for the Jews did not abide in their own Land for ever. 1. Before Christs time, when they returned out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> 'twas but a small number that returned to their own Land, and those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode not long there neither. 2. They were so far from ruling over all Nations, that they were tributary to them. 3. Their bounds were much straitned. 4. When the Jews shall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yet I think no sober man will say, they shall no more be pulled up out of their own Land, but shall abide there for ever, as the letter of the Text imports. I know that <hi>for ever,</hi> is oft in Scripture put for an age, or for a long time; but the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenaries take it here in the letter, at least for their thousand years reign, but without any ground.</p>
               <p>But take the words spiritually, as alluding to Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in Gospel-times, and then all these Promises are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly fulfilled, though not <hi>specifically,</hi> in the same kind, yet <hi>Valore,</hi> in spirituals, which are of far greater value than if they had been Lords of the East and West <hi>Indies</hi>; besides the bounds of the Church are very much enlarged by the Gospel.</p>
               <p>So that I shall (with the best Divines) take the words in a spiritual sense, for the perseverance of the Saints; such as are
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:58817:273"/>
true Members of Christs Church shall never fall away, none shall pull them from Christ, or separate them from his love. Christ will so settle his Church upon earth, that it shall never be rooted up by the violence of men, nor be prevailed against by the gates of Hell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here is the confirmation of all this, <hi>saith the Lord thy God.</hi> He is <hi>Thy</hi> God in Covenant, reconciled to thee in Christ, ready to give thee all things needful for life and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. 'Tis he that hath promised, who cannot lye, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and therefore thou mayest safely build upon his word.</p>

            <p>This of the Man, let us now to the Matter.</p>
            <p>This text in <hi>Amos</hi> (saith Dr. <hi>Homes</hi>) will prove (for to that end he cites it) <hi>that all the Saints departed shall rise and reigne with Christ a thousand years here upon earth,</hi>

               <hi>in a wonderful, visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, spiritual, glorious manner, drinking Wine, and enjoying the Quintessence of the Creatures, &amp;c.</hi> Now how this text should prove such a Tenet, I must confess my dimme eyes cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. But the Doctor, who can see as farre into a Milstone as another man, will clear it up. But first, lest we should think the Doctor to be singular in this opinion, he tells you, that the great <hi>Mercer,</hi> and judicious <hi>Calvin</hi> on the place, concur with him (in the main at least) in this point; which how true (besides what I have already produced before in the Commentary) I come now to examine.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Mercer</hi> on the place, of all Commentators, I find him most inclining, yea peremptory for a Spiritual sense in all these five Verses. How oft doth he cry, <hi>Haec non ad literam, non ad literam, sed Spiritualiter, spiritualiter, spiritualiter sunt accipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anda</hi>?

the ten Tribes into their own country.</hi> But a greater than Doctor <hi>Homes</hi> is of another judgement, it is the learned Doctor <hi>Rivet,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But to put all out of controversie, St. <hi>Iames</hi> citing <hi>Amos</hi> 9.11, 12. interprets them Spiritually, and proves the calling and conversion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the Apostolical times from them (as I have shewed before) <hi>Acts</hi> 15.7. to 17. now whether shall we beleeve the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> that interprets these words Spiritually, or Doctor <hi>Homes</hi> who mainly contends for a literal sense?</p>

            <p>Lastly, the Doctor in the close of all challengeth all the Men, and Books in the World, to shew when ever these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises were yet fulfilled? <hi>When</hi> (saith this self-conceited Doctor) <hi>were all the wast Cities re-built, the breaches made up, when was there ever yet all spiritual, and all outward prosperity in the Church?

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If you take the Promises spiritually, St. <hi>Iames</hi> hath told us they were fulfilled in the Apostles dayes; if you take them literally they never were, nor ever will be fulfilled; who ever looks for a sinless, sorrowless, deathless condition, (as the Doctor dream of) in this world, when the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains shall run Wine, &amp;c. none but grosse Fanaticks will

fancy such fables. I am even tired with mentioning them.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But if this text in</hi> Amos <hi>will not prove the point, yet the Doctor hath one prime place which will prove it</hi> terminis termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantibus, <hi>and that is</hi> Revel. 20.4, 5, 6.</p>

<q>Nunc aliud tempus, alii pro tempore mores.</q>

            <p>But hear what he sayes (in his Set. on 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. p. 4. to 7. preacht before the Parliament, 1641. where he strongly asserts the excellency of the Presbyterian Government, <hi>p.</hi> 29.38, &amp;c.<note place="margin">

The text tells us (saith he) that it is their <hi>Souls</hi> shall reign, and not their Bodies, and by a thousand years is meant an eternity of felicity and reigning in heaven. Then he cites <hi>Parcus</hi> on <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. against them, and perswades his Reader to read that Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man on that point.
