         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He accurate ſearches into the Secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which this Age hath produced, though
they are in themſelves ſufficient evidences of
a commendable Induſtry; yet ſeeing they fall
ſo exceedingly ſhort of that diſcovery which
Men aim at, giving us at beſt but probable
conjectures, and uncertain gueſſes, they are become as little
ſatisfactory to Men that look after the true cauſes of things,
as thoſe Ships of deſire; whoſe great undertaking for Gold
had raiſed high expectations in their attempts; but in the
return, brought nothing home for their Ventures but Apes
and Peacocks. While Men reflect upon themſelves under
ſuch Diſappointments, they cannot but check themſelves, for
over-promiſing themſelves in their Adventures, with that
of <hi>Zophar, Vain Man would be wiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how happy would it be for Men, if ſuch failures of
expectation might better inform them? If our Attainments
in theſe purſuits will not bear our Charges, nor recompence
our pains, and loſs of time, with an anſwerable profit, though
we may ſee cauſe ſometimes (as a Divertiſement or Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation)
to uſe them; yet how ſhall we ſatisfie our ſelves to
make them our chief and ſole buſineſs?</p>
                  <p>If we knew of nothing of higher concern to us than theſe, our
neglect of greater Matters were more excuſable; but ſeeing
we are ſufficiently inſtructed, that we have more weighty
things to look after, ſuch as relate to a certain future eſtate of
happineſs or miſery: the very diſcovery of this to a Rational
Being muſt needs intitle ſuch things to the firſt and greateſt
part of his care. He that knows that there is <hi>one thing
<pb facs="tcp:49412:3"/>
neceſſary,</hi> and yet ſuffers himſelf to be diverted from the
purſuit of that, by <hi>troubling himſelf about many things,</hi>
is more juſtly chargable with folly, than he that neglects his
Eſtate, and finds himſelf no other Imployment, but to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
Feathers in the Wind.</p>
                  <p>Among thoſe things that Religion offers to our ſtudy, <hi>God</hi>
and our <hi>own hearts</hi> are the chief. God is the <hi>Firſt</hi> and
<hi>Laſt,</hi> and <hi>whole</hi> of our Happineſs, the Beginning, Progreſs,
and Compleatment of it is from him, and in him, for in that
Centre do all the Lines meet, but our Heart is the Stage upon
which this Felicity (as to the application of it) is tranſacted:
upon this little ſpot of Earth, doth God and Satan draw up
their ſeveral Armies; here doth each of them ſhew their
Power and Wiſdom; this is treated by both, each of them
challenge an intereſt in it; 'tis attaqued on the one ſide, and
defended on the other. So that here are Skirmiſhes, Battels,
and Stratagems managed; that Man then that will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
himſelf in his Enquiries, how the Matter goes in his
own Heart, what Ground is got or loſt, what Forts are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
or defended, what Mines are ſprung, what Ambuſcado's
laid, or how the Battel proceeds: muſt needs lie under a juſt
imputation of the greateſt folly; neither can he be excuſed
in his neglect, by the moſt preſſing ſollicitations of other things
that ſeem to require his attendance upon the higheſt imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
pretences of neceſſity: For what is he profited, that
gains <hi>the whole World, if he loſes his Soul?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the exact and faithful management of ſuch ſpiritual
Enquiries, with their neceſſary improvement to diligent
watchfulneſs, and careful endeavours of reſiſtance, is another
manner of work than moſt Men dream of: To diſcover the
<hi>intrigues</hi> of Satans policy, to eſpie his haunts and lurking
places in our hearts, to note his ſubtile contrivances in taking
advantages againſt us, and to obſerve how the Pulſe of the
Soul beats under his provocations, and deceitful allurements,
<pb facs="tcp:49412:3"/>
how far we comply or diſſent; requires ſo much attendance
and laborious skilfulneſs, that it cannot be expected that ſuch
Men who deſign no more than to be Chriſtians at the <hi>eaſieſt</hi>
rate, and content themſelves with a formal ſuperficiality of
Religion; or ſuch, who, having given up themſelves to the
deceitful <hi>ſweets</hi> of worldly carnal delights, are not at <hi>lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
to engage themſelves in ſo ſerious a Work; or ſuch
whoſe ſecret <hi>guilt</hi> of rebellious Combination with the Devil
againſt God, makes them <hi>fearful</hi> to conſider fully, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of that wickedneſs, which they had rather practiſe
with forgetfulneſs, leſt the review of their ways, and ſight
of their danger, ſhould awaken their Conſciences to give
them an unwelcome diſquiet; it cannot (I ſay) be expected
that any of theſe ſorts of Men (whilſt they are thus ſet)
ſhould give themſelves the trouble of ſo much pains and toil
as this Buſineſs doth require.</p>
                  <p>Upon this conſideration, I might rationally fix my Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
of the entertainment of the following Treatiſe. What
acceptance ſoever it may find with ſuch as are cordially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for their Souls, and the Realities of Religion, (and
of ſuch I may ſay as the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> concerning <hi>Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Love,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4. 9. as touching this Matter, <hi>They
need not that I write unto them, for they themſelves are
taught of God</hi> to be ſuſpicious of Satans devices; and by
experience they find his deceits ſo ſecret, and withal ſo
dangerous, that any help for further diſcovery and caution,
muſt needs be welcome to them; yet) to be ſure the Prince
of Darkneſs (who is always jealous of the leaſt attempts
that may be made againſt his Empire) will arm his foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Subjects againſt it, and whomſoever elſe he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon, by the power of prejudice, to reject it, as urging
us to a ſtudy more ſevere or harſh, than is conſiſtent, either
with the lower degrees of knowledge of many, or with that
eaſe which moſt Men deſire to indulge to themſelves; or as
<pb facs="tcp:49412:4"/>
offering ſuch things which they (to ſave themſelves from
further trouble) will be willing to call <hi>Chimaera's</hi> or idle
Speculations: and this laſt I may rather expect, becauſe in
this latter Age, Satan hath advanced ſo far in his general
deſign againſt all <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and for the introduction of
<hi>Paganiſm</hi> and <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> that now none can expreſs a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conſcientious care for holineſs, and the avoidance of ſin;
but upon pain of the imputation of <hi>ſillineſs,</hi> or <hi>whining
preciſeneſs;</hi> and none can ſpeak or write of Converſion,
Faith, or Grace, but he ſhall be hazarded by the ſcoffs of
thoſe that are unwilling to judge the private workings of the
heart to Godward, or ſpiritual exerciſes of Grace, to be
any better than conceited <hi>Whims,</hi> and <hi>unintelligible Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe:</hi>
but ſeeing ſuch Men make bold to jeer, not only
that Language, and thoſe forms of Speech which the Holy
Ghoſt thought fit to make uſe of in the Scriptures, but alſo
the very things of Faith, Grace, and Spirit, which are
every where in the Sacred <hi>Oracles</hi> recommended to us with
the moſt weighty ſeriouſneſs, (which with them paſs for no
better than <hi>cheats</hi> and <hi>fancies)</hi> we can eaſily ſit under their
contempt; and ſhall (as we hope) be ſo far from being
jeered out of our Religion, that their ſcorns ſhall have no
more impreſſion upon us, than the ravings of a frenzical
Perſon that knows not what he ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding theſe, (who are no way conſiderable for
weight) there are, I hope, a great many, who ſeriouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
themſelves in the Inwards, as well as the Outwards of
Religion, (and who will not ſuffer themſelves to be perſwaded,
that the Apoſtle obtruded an empty Notion upon Believers,
when he recommended that obſervable Truth to them, <hi>Rom.
2. 28. He is not a Jew which is one outwardly,</hi> &amp;c.)
for their ſakes have I undertaken this labour of collecting
and methodizing the grand Stratagems, and chief ways of
deluſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on of the great Deceiver. To theſe I muſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb facs="tcp:49412:4"/>
account for ſome few things relating to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
As,</p>
                  <p>1. That I have ſatisfied my ſelf in the Reaſons of the
publication of theſe Papers, and do not judg it requiſite to
trouble any ſo far, as to tell what theſe Reaſons are. They
who deſire to reſiſt ſuch an Enemy, and whoſe experience
doth convince them, that all helps are neceſſary, will not need
them, and thoſe that are Men of ſcorn, or of avowed care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs,
will not regard them though I ſhould declare them.</p>
                  <p>2. To prevent the miſapprehenſions (which poſſibly ſome
may otherwiſe labour withal) of a monſtrous product from
one Text, becauſe they may obſerve one Text in the Front,
and no other mentioned throughout the Firſt and Second
Parts; they may know, that I made uſe of ſeveral in the
preaching of theſe Diſcourſes, as ſuitable Foundations for
the ſeveral Particulars herein mentioned; but in the
moulding up of the Whole, into the method of a Treatiſe,
for the eaſe of the Reader, I thought fit to lay aſide thoſe
Introductions, as alſo many other occaſional Applications,
which were proper for Sermons, and a great many things
which were neceſſary to be ſpoken for Explication and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of theſe Points to a popular Auditory, and have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſented the Subſtance in a more cloſe connection; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
if there be any little obſcurity that may at firſt appear to
any, for want of variety of words, the Treatiſe being under
their eye, will be at leiſure to attend their review in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
or third reading: Which however I would recommend
earneſtly to thoſe that, in theſe Concerns, do really deſign to
be <hi>wiſe for themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Neither ſhould it ſeem ſtrange, that I have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made uſe of Inſtances from Hiſtory, or other later Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Whoſoever ſhall conſider the nature of the Matter
treated on, will not complain of this as a needleſs trouble
put upon them; yet withal I have been ſo careful of doing
<pb facs="tcp:49412:5"/>
any Perſons an unkindneſs, by making too bold with them,
that I mentioned no Names but ſuch, as upon ſuch occaſions
have been made publick by others before. The reſt I have
only mentioned in the general, diſcovering their caſe where
it was uſeful, but concealing the Perſons.</p>
                  <p>4. It may perhaps ſeem a defect, that the ſeveral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
Remedies, or Counſels, which are requiſite to be
obſerved in making reſiſtance against Satan, are not added,
except ſome few hints in the latter end of the Third Part,
and ſome other things in that Part, in the Applications of
the ſeveral Doctrines therein, (which I thought fit, upon
good grounds, to leave in the order of a Preaching Method)
but ſuch may be pleaſed to conſider, that ſeveral have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that part very fully, to whoſe Labours I had rather
refer the Reader, than trouble him with a repetition: It
was only my deſign to endeavour a more full diſcovery (though
every way ſhort of the thing it ſelf) of Satan's Craft, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the knowledg of this is ſo neceſſary, and withal others
have done it more ſparingly. Such as it is accept, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
for thy ſpiritual advantage; for that was the end of
this undertaking, by him who deſires that thy Soul may
proſper,</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. Of the Malice of Satan in particular. The Grounds and
Cauſes of that Malice. The Greatneſs of it proved;
and Inſtances of that Greatneſs given.</head>
                     <p>I Shall <hi>firſt</hi> give ſome account of his <hi>Malice,</hi> by which it ſhall
appear, we do not wrong the Devil in calling him malicious;
the truth of which Charge, will evidence it ſelf in the following
particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt; The Devil, though <hi>a Spirit,</hi> yet is a proper <hi>Subject</hi> of Sin.
We need no other evidence for this, than what doth by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
reſult from our ſelves; we have ſins, which <hi>our Spirits</hi>
and Hearts do act, that relate not to the Body, called <hi>a filthineſs
of the Spirit,</hi> in contradiſtinction to the <hi>filthineſs of the Fleſh.</hi> 'Tis
true it cannot be denyed, but that thoſe Iniquities which have a
neceſſary dependance upon the <hi>Organs</hi> of the Body, (as Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,
Fornication, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> cannot properly, as to the <hi>formality
of the Act,</hi> be laid at Satan's door, (though as a tempter and
provoker of theſe in Men, he may be called the Father of theſe
ſins) yet the forementioned Iniquities which are of a Spiritual
Nature, are <hi>properly and formally</hi> committed by him, as Lying,
Pride, Hatred, and Malice. And this diſtinction Chriſt himſelf
doth hint, <hi>Joh. 8. 44. When he ſpeaketh a Lye, he ſpeaketh of his
own;</hi> where he aſſerts ſuch ſpiritual Sins to be <hi>properly</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
acted by himſelf. The certainty of all appears in the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites</hi>
given him, the <hi>wicked One,</hi> the <hi>unclean Spirit;</hi> as alſo thoſe
places that ſpeak his fall, <hi>They kept not their firſt Eſtate,</hi> Jude 6.
<hi>The Angels that ſinned,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 4. If ſins Spiritual are in a true
and proper ſenſe attributed to the Devil, then alſo may Malice
be attributed to him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; The wickedneſs of Satan is capable of <hi>increaſe,</hi> a
<hi>magis</hi> &amp; <hi>minus,</hi> though he be a wicked Spirit, and as to inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
full of wickedneſs, though ſo ſtrongly inclined that he cannot
but ſin; and therefore as God is ſet forth to us, as the <hi>Fountain</hi>
of Holineſs, ſo is Satan called the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> of Sin. Yet
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49412:14"/>
                        <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49412:15"/>
ſeeing we cannot aſcribe an <hi>infiniteneſs</hi> to him, we muſt admit,
that (as to acts of Sin at leaſt) he may be more or leſs ſinful,
and that the wickedneſs of his heart may be more drawn out, by
<hi>Occaſion,</hi> Motives, and Provocations: beſides we are expreſly
taught thus much, <hi>Rev. 12. 12. The Devil is come down, having
great wrath, becauſe his time is ſhort:</hi> where we note (1.) that
his wrath is called <hi>great,</hi> implying greater than at other times.
(2.) That <hi>External Motives</hi> and Incentives, (as the ſhortneſs of
his time) prevail with him to draw forth greater acts of
fury.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly; Whatſoever <hi>Occaſions</hi> do draw out, or kindle malice
to a rage, Satan hath met with them in an <hi>eminent degree,</hi> in his
own <hi>fall,</hi>

malice, than <hi>hurts</hi> or <hi>puniſhments, degradations</hi> from happineſs.
Satan's Curſe, though juſt, fills him with rage, and fretting
<hi>againſt God,</hi> when he conſiders that from the ſtate and dignity of
a <hi>bleſſed Angel,</hi> he is caſt down to <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and to the baſeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
imaginable: for the part of his Curſe, (which concerned
Satan as well as the Serpent) <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon thy belly ſhalt thou go, and duſt
ſhall be thy Meat,</hi> implies a ſtate moſt baſe; as the uſe of the phraſe
proves, <hi>they ſhall lick the duſt of thy feet. Thine enemies ſhall lick
the duſt,</hi> Pſal. 72. 9. <hi>They ſhall lick the duſt as a Serpent,</hi> Mich. 7. 17.
Where the Spirit is ſo wicked,<note place="margin">Eſa. 49. 23.</note> that it cannot <hi>accept the puniſhment</hi>
of its iniquity. All puniſhment is as a <hi>poyſon,</hi> and invenoms the
heart with a <hi>rage</hi> againſt the hand that afflicted it; thus doth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
fall enrage him, and the more, when he ſees Man enſtated
into a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of enjoying what he hath loſt. The envy and
pride of his heart boils up to a madneſs (for that is the only uſe,
that the wretchedly miſerable can make, of the ſight of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
which they enjoy not; eſpecially if having once enjoyed it,
they are now deprived): this begot the rage and wrath in <hi>Cain</hi>
againſt <hi>Abel,</hi> and afterward his Murther. The <hi>eye</hi> of the wicked
is <hi>evil,</hi> where God is <hi>good.</hi> Hence may it be concluded, that
Satan (being a wicked Spirit, and this wickedneſs being capable
of acting higher or lower according to occaſions, and with a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs
thereto) cannot but ſhew an unconceiveable malice
againſt us, <hi>our happineſs</hi> and <hi>his miſery</hi> being ſuch <hi>proper occaſions</hi>
for the wickedneſs of his heart to work upon.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly; This Malice in Satan muſt be <hi>great:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt; If we conſider the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of his wickedneſs in ſo great
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49412:15"/>
and <hi>total</hi> an Apoſtacy. He is ſo filled with iniquity, that we

                     <p>Secondly; The Scripture lays to his charge all <hi>Degrees, Acts,</hi>
and <hi>Branches</hi> of Malice; As (1.) <hi>Anger,</hi> in the <hi>impetuous</hi> haſt and
violence of it, <hi>Rev. 12. great wrath,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> there ſignifies <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candeſcentia,</hi>
the <hi>Inflammation</hi> of the Heart, and whole Man;
which is violent in its motion, as when the Blood with a violent
ſtream ruſheth through the Heart, and ſets all Spirits on fire; and
therefore this Wrath is not only called great, but is alſo ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be ſo, in its threatning <hi>a wo to the Inhabitants of the Earth.</hi>
(2.) <hi>Indignation</hi> is more than Anger, as having more of a <hi>fixed</hi>
fury; and this is applyed to him <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 27. in that thoſe that
have this <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, are ſaid <hi>to give place to the Devil;</hi> which
is true, not only in point of temptation, but alſo in reſpect of
the <hi>reſemblance</hi> they carry to the frame and temper of Satan's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
heart. (3.) <hi>Hatred</hi> is yet higher than Wrath or Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<note place="margin">Ira brevis furor.</note> as having deeper roots, a more confirmed and <hi>implacable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution;</hi>
Anger and Indignation are but <hi>ſhort Furies,</hi> which like
a Land Flood are ſoon down, though they are apt to fill the Banks
on a ſudden; but Hatred is laſting, and this is ſo properly the
Devil's diſpoſition, that <hi>Cain</hi> in <hi>hating his Brother,</hi> is <hi>(1 John 3.
12.)</hi> ſaid to be the proper Off-ſpring and lively Picture of that
<hi>wicked One,</hi> who is there ſo called, rather than by the name of
the Devil, becauſe the Apoſtle would alſo inſinuate, that hatred
is the <hi>Maſter-piece</hi> of Satan's wickedneſs, and that which gives
the <hi>fulleſt Character</hi> of him. (4.) All <hi>Effects</hi> of his cruelty ariſe
from this Root; this makes him <hi>accuſe</hi> and calumniate; this
puts him upon breathing after thoſe <hi>murthers</hi> and deſtructions
which damned Spirits are now groaning under.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly; This Malice is the <hi>reſult</hi> of that <hi>Curſe</hi> laid upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
<hi>Gen. 3. 15. I will put enmity betwixt thee and the Woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her Seed and thy Seed:</hi> Which implies (1.) a <hi>great enmity;</hi>
and ſome render it, <hi>inimicitias implacabiles,</hi> implacable enmities.
(2.) A <hi>laſting enmity,</hi> ſuch as ſhould continue as long as the Curſe
ſhould laſt. (3.) That this ſhould be <hi>his work</hi> and exerciſe, to
proſecute and be proſecuted with this enmity; ſo that it ſhews,
the Devil's <hi>whole</hi> mind and deſire is in this Work, and that he is
<hi>whetted</hi> on, by the <hi>oppoſing</hi> enmity which he meets withal, it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49412:16"/>
the Work of his <hi>Curſe,</hi> of his <hi>Place,</hi> of his <hi>Revenge,</hi> and that
wherein all the delight he is capable of, is placed. In that part
of the Curſe, <hi>Duſt ſhall be thy Meat;</hi> 'tis implyed, (if ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
right) that if Satan can be ſaid to have <hi>any delight</hi> or eaſe
in his Condition,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Pool</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nop. in loc.</note> 'tis in the eating of <hi>this Duſt,</hi> the exerciſe of
this Enmity: No wonder then if Chriſt ſpeak of his deſires and
ſollicitations with God, to have a liberty and Commiſſion for
this Work; <hi>Satan hath deſired to have thee, that he may winnow
thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That this Curſe relates not only to the <hi>Serpent</hi> who was the
<hi>Inſtrument,</hi> but alſo to <hi>Satan</hi> who was the <hi>Agent,</hi> is agreed by all
almoſt, that it was not the Serpent <hi>alone,</hi> but the Devil ſpeaking
by it, is evinced, from its <hi>ſpeaking</hi> and <hi>reaſoning;</hi> and that the
Curſe reached further than a <hi>natural Enmity</hi> 'twixt a Serpent and
a Man, is as evident, in that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is expreſly held forth, as
giving the full accompliſhment of this Curſe againſt <hi>Satan,</hi>
1 John 3. 8. <hi>The Devil ſinneth from the beginning: for this purpoſe
was the Son of God manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the Works of the
Devil;</hi> which is a clear Expoſition and <hi>Paraphraſis</hi> of the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Seed bruiſing the Serpents head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly; I ſhall add to this ſome few <hi>Inſtances</hi> of Satan's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
by which it will appear to be great.</p>
                     <p>Firſt; That Malice muſt needs be great, which ſhews it ſelf,
where there is ſuch a load of <hi>anguiſh</hi> and <hi>horror</hi> that lies upon him;
he is now <hi>reſerved in Chains of Darkneſs in Hell;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 4.</note> he is <hi>in Hell,</hi> a
place of Torment; or which is all one, <hi>Hell is in him,</hi> he carries
it about him in his Conſcience, which by God's decree binds him
to his horror like a Chain. 'Tis ſcarce imaginable that he ſhould
have a thought free from the contemplation of his own miſery,
to ſpend in a malicious purſuit of Man. What can we think
leſs of it, than a deſperate madneſs and revenge againſt God,
wherein he ſhews his rage againſt Heaven, and hunts after our
Blood, as for a <hi>little Water</hi> to <hi>cool his Tongue;</hi> and when he finds
his hand too ſhort to pull the <hi>Almighty</hi> out of his Throne; he
endeavours <hi>(Panther-like)</hi> to tear his <hi>Image</hi> in Man, and to put
Man, created after his Image, upon blaſpheming and diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Maker.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; That Malice muſt needs be great, that <hi>ſeeks</hi> its
own <hi>Fewel,</hi> and provides or begs its own Occaſions; and thoſe,
ſuch as give no <hi>proper provocation</hi> to his anger. Of this temper is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49412:16"/>
his Malice, he did thus with <hi>Job,</hi> he begs the Commiſſion, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniates
<hi>Job</hi> upon unjuſt ſurmiſes; preſſeth ſtill for a further
power to hurt him, in ſo much that God expreſly ſtints and
bounds him, (which ſhews how boundleſs he would have been
if left to his own will) and gives him at laſt an open check,
<hi>Job</hi> 2. 3. wherein he lays open the malice of his heart in three
things. (1.) His own preſſing urgency, <hi>Thou movedſt me.</hi> (2.) His
deſtructive Fury, no leſs would ſerve, than <hi>Job</hi>'s <hi>utter deſtruction.</hi>
(3.) <hi>Job</hi>'s Innocency; <hi>All this without cauſe, thou movedſt me to
deſtroy him without cauſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly; That Malice muſt needs be great, that will purſue a
<hi>ſmall matter:</hi> what ſmall game will the Devil play, rather than al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ſit out? If he can but trouble, or puzzle, or affright;
yet that he will do, rather than nothing, if he can (like an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar
in the Path) but bite the <hi>Heel,</hi> though his <hi>Head</hi> be bruiſed
for it, he will notwithſtanding buſie himſelf in it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That Malice muſt be great, which will put it ſelf
forth where it knows it can <hi>prevail nothing,</hi> but is certain of a
diſappointment. Thus did Satan tempt <hi>Chriſt;</hi> thoſe Speeches,
<hi>if thou be the Son of God,</hi> do not imply any doubt in Satan; he
knew what was <hi>propheſied</hi> of Chriſt, and what had been <hi>declared
from Heaven</hi> in teſtification of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that he could not but be
certain he was <hi>God</hi> and Man; and yet what baſe unworthy temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
doth he lay before him, as <hi>to fall down and worſhip him?</hi>
Was it that Satan thought to prevail againſt him? No ſurely,
but ſuch was his Malice, that he would put an affront upon him,
though he knew he could not prevail againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Malice of <hi>wicked Men,</hi> is an Argument of Satan's
great Malice; they have an <hi>antipathy</hi> againſt the Righteous, (as
the Wolf againſt the Sheep) and upon that very ground, that
they are <hi>called out of the World;</hi> how great this fury is, all Ages
have teſtified: This hath brought forth Diſcord, Revilings,
Slanders, Impriſonments, ſpoiling of Goods, Baniſhments, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions,
Tortures, cruel Deaths, as Burning, Racking, Tearing,
ſawing aſunder, and what-ever the wit of Man could deviſe, for
a ſatisfaction to thoſe implacable, furious, murtherous minds;
and yet all this is done to Men of the ſame Image and Lineage
with themſelves, of the ſame Religion with themſelves (as to
the main); nay, ſome time to Men of their own Kindred, their
own Fleſh and Blood, and all to thoſe that would live peaceably
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49412:17"/>
in the Land. What ſhall we ſay to theſe things? How come Men
to put on a <hi>ſavage Nature,</hi> to act the part of <hi>Lions, Leopards,
Tigars,</hi> if not much worſe? The reaſon of all we have, <hi>John 8.
54. Ye are of your Father the Devil, he was a Murtherer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;</hi>
as alſo <hi>Gen. 3. 15. I will put enmity between her Seed and
thy Seed:</hi> So that all this ſhews what malice is in Satan's Heart,
who urgeth and provokes his Inſtruments, to ſuch bloody ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds.
Hence who-ever were the <hi>Agents,</hi> Rev. 2. 10. in impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
the Saints, the Malice of Satan in ſtirring them up to it,
makes him become the Author of it; <hi>Satan ſhall caſt ſome of you
into Priſon.</hi>

                        <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> makes it an
evidence of his incomprehenſible Power, that ſuch Armies of
ſtrong and mighty Creatures are at his command. But this only
in the general. That which comes nearer to a particular account
of their ſtrength, is that Notion of <hi>a Spirit,</hi> by which they are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49412:17"/>
frequently deſcribed;<note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>He maketh his Angels Spirits, his Miniſters
flaming Fire.</hi> The <hi>being</hi> of a Spirit is the higheſt our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is able to reach, and that it ſhews a <hi>being</hi> very <hi>excellent,</hi> is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
in this, that <hi>God</hi> is pleaſed to repreſent himſelf to us under the
notion of a <hi>Spirit;</hi> Not that he is <hi>truly</hi> and properly ſuch, but that
this is the moſt excellent Being that falls under our apprehenſion.
Beſides, that the tearm <hi>Spirit,</hi> raiſeth our underſtanding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a Being of an high and extraordinary Power; it doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tend to form our conceptions to ſome apprehenſions of <hi>their
Nature:</hi> (1.) From the knowledg that we have of our own
Spirits; that our Spirit is of a <hi>vaſt comprehenſion</hi> and <hi>activity,</hi> our
Thoughts, Deſires, Reaſonings, and the particular Undertakings
of ſome Men of a raiſed Spirit, do abundantly evidence. (2.) In
that it repreſents a Spiritual Being, <hi>freed</hi> from the <hi>clog</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
of <hi>corporeity,</hi> our own Spirits are <hi>limited</hi> and reſtrained
by our Bodies, as Fire, an active Element, is retarded and made
ſluggiſh by Matter unapt to ſerve its proper force, as when 'tis in
an heap of Earth; which is alſo ſufficiently pointed at in that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
betwixt <hi>Fleſh and Blood,</hi> and <hi>Principalities and Powers,</hi>
Epheſ. 6. ſhewing that Fleſh and Blood are a <hi>diſadvantage</hi> and
hinderance to the <hi>activity</hi> of a Spirit. A Spirit then, as <hi>in corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real,</hi>
may be conceived to move <hi>eaſily</hi> without moleſtation, <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
imperceptibly</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtibly..</hi> (3.) This is yet further illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
by the Similitude of <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> which are (to the
common experience of all) of very great force. And 'tis yet
further obſervable,<note place="margin">

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, Col. 1. 16.</note> that the Scripture ſometime ſpeaks of the
power of Angels in the <hi>Abſtract,</hi> chuſing rather to call them
<hi>Powers</hi> than <hi>powerful;</hi> clearly ſhewing, that Angels are Beings
of vaſt ſtrength, as indeed the Actions done by them do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
teſtifie; ſuch was the deſtroying <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Hoſt in a

of the Faithful, or puniſhing of the wicked.</p>
                     <p>Though this may fully ſatisfie us that Angels excel in ſtrength,
yet the Scripture ſuggeſts another conſideration relating to the
<hi>Office</hi> and Imployment of Angels, where their Commiſſion ſhews
not only a <hi>liberty</hi> for the Exerciſe of this Power, but alſo doth
imply ſuch a Power as is <hi>fit</hi> to be <hi>commiſſionated</hi> to ſuch Acts; theſe
Inviſible Beings are called <hi>Thrones, Dominions, Principalities,
Powers,</hi> 1 Col. 16. 'Tis indeed a task beyond a ſober under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking

and Marks of difference; This, <hi>Auguſtin</hi> acknowledged, yet may
we hence conclude, (1.) that theſe words imply a very <hi>great
Authority</hi> in Angels. (2.) A power and <hi>ſtrength</hi> ſuitable to their
Imployment, and that God furniſhed them with power anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the Work which he intended for them, in his moving
the Heavens, and governing the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However, in
ſome Caſes, God works by Inſtruments every way <hi>diſproportionable</hi>
to the Service,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Enchirid.</hi> ad <hi>Laurent.</hi> c. 58.</note> 
                        <hi>That the excellency of the Power might be of God;</hi>
yet in the <hi>ordinary</hi> way of his working, he puts an <hi>innate, ſuitable</hi>
force in Creatures, for the Acts to be done by them; as there is
an innate Power in the Wind to blow, in the Fire to burn, in
Herbs and Plants for Medicinal uſes. Thus may we conceive of
Angels, that God uſing them as <hi>his Hoſt,</hi> his <hi>Miniſters to do his
pleaſure;</hi> he hath indowed them with an innate natural Power
for thoſe great things which he doth by them; which muſt not
be ſuppoſed in the leaſt <hi>derogatory</hi> to the Power of God, in his
ways of Mercies or Judgments, ſeeing all the ſtrength of Angels
is <hi>originally</hi> from God: hence is it that all the Names of Angels
which we read of in Scripture carry this acknowledgment in
their <hi>ſignification; Michael</hi> thus unfolds it ſelf, <hi>Who is like God.
Gabriel</hi> thus, <hi>The Glory of God;</hi> and therefore may we ſuppoſe
them not ſo much the <hi>proper</hi> Names of Angels, but (as <hi>Calvin</hi>

great Power in them.</p>
                     <p>Such a powerful Spirit is Satan by <hi>Creation.</hi> But becauſe it will
be doubted leſt his fall hath <hi>bereaved</hi> him of his excellency, and
<hi>caſt him down from his ſtrength;</hi> I ſhall evidence that he ſtill retains
the ſame <hi>natural</hi> Power: To which purpoſe, 'tis not unfit to be
obſerved, (1.) that the <hi>ſame</hi> Terms and Names which were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>good Angels,</hi> to ſignifie their Strength and Commiſſion,
<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. and 1. 10. are alſo given to <hi>Satan,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 12. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi>
are called <hi>Principalities, Powers, Rulers;</hi> and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. they
have the ſame Names which in <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. were given to good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<hi>he ſpoiled Principalities and Powers.</hi> (2.) The Scripture
gives particular <hi>Inſtances</hi> of Satan's Power and Working, as his
raiſing Tempeſts in the Air, commanding Fire from Heaven;
both which he did in proſecution of his Malice againſt <hi>Job;</hi> his
carrying the Bodies of Men in the Air, as he did with Chriſt,
hurrying him from the Wilderneſs to the Mountain, from thence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49412:18"/>
to the Pinacle of the Temple; his breaking Chains and Fetters
of Iron, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 4. His bringing Diſeaſes, inſtances whereof
were that crooked Woman whom Satan had <hi>bowed together,</hi>
Luke 13. 16. and the <hi>Lunatick Perſon,</hi> Luk. 9. 31. with a great
many more. (3.) 'Tis alſo obſervable, that notwithſtanding
Satan's fall hath made an <hi>alteration</hi> as to the <hi>Ends, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes,</hi> and <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
of his Power; yet nevertheleſs <hi>God makes uſe</hi> of this ſtrength
in him, not only as an <hi>Executioner</hi> of Wrath againſt his Enemies,
(as when he vexed <hi>Saul</hi> by this Evil Spirit;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 14.</note> and through this
<hi>Lying Spirit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 King. 22. 21.</note> gave up <hi>Ahab</hi> to be deluded into his ruin, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
Plagues upon <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 49.</note> by ſending <hi>Evil Angels among them)</hi>
but alſo for the <hi>tryal</hi> of his own Servants; thus was <hi>Job</hi> afflicted
by Satan, and <hi>Paul</hi> buffeted by his <hi>Meſſenger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly; This Power of his, as a <hi>Devil,</hi> falls next under our
conſideration, wherein are divers Particulars to be noted: As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, His <hi>Commiſſion</hi> and Authority. If any put that Queſtion
to him, which the Jews did to Chriſt; <hi>By what Authority doſt thou
theſe things?</hi> or, <hi>Who gave thee this Authority?</hi> We have the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
in <hi>John</hi> 12. 24. and 16. 11. where he is called <hi>the Prince of
this World;</hi> and accordingly the Scripture ſpeaks of a two-fold
Kingdom of <hi>Light</hi> and of <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> and in this we hear of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
<hi>Seat</hi> or Throne, of his <hi>Servants</hi> and Subjects. Yea, that
which is more, the Scripture ſpeaks of a kind of <hi>Deity</hi> in Satan;
he is called <hi>the God of this World,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. Which doth not
only ſet forth the intollerable pride and <hi>uſurpation</hi> of Satan in
propounding himſelf as ſuch, ſo drawing on poor blind Creatures
to worſhip him,<note place="margin">Zancheus.</note> but alſo diſcovers his Power, which by <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
he hath obtained over the <hi>Children of Diſobedience.</hi> Hence
doth he challenge it, as a kind of right and due from the poor
<hi>Americans</hi> and others, that they ſhould fall down and worſhip
him; and upon this Suppoſition was he ſo intollerably preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
in offering the Kingdoms of the World to Chriſt for ſuch
a Service and Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>If it be queſtioned,<note place="margin">Q.</note> What Satan's Authority is? I ſhall anſwer
it thus.</p>
                     <p>Firſt;<note place="margin">A.</note> His Authority is not <hi>abſolute</hi> or <hi>unlimited;</hi> he cannot do
what he pleaſeth, and therefore we do find him begging leave
of God for the exerting of his Power in particular Caſes, as
when he was a Lying Spirit in the Mouth of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Prophets,
and in every Aſſault he made upon <hi>Job;</hi> nay, he could not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49412:19"/>
enter into the <hi>Swine</hi> of the <hi>Gaderens,</hi> till he had Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
for it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; Yet hath he a Commiſſion in general, <hi>a ſtanding
Commiſſion,</hi> as petty Kings and Governours had under the <hi>Roman
Emperor,</hi> where they were authoriſed to exerciſe an Authority
and Power, according to the Rules and Directions given them;
this is clearly ſignified by thoſe Expreſſions, they are Captives <hi>at
his Will</hi>—and <hi>given up to Satan,</hi> as Perſons Excommunicated;
and when Men are converted, they are ſaid to be <hi>tranſlated from
his Power,</hi> and put under another Juriſdiction, in the <hi>Kingdom of
Chriſt.</hi> All which would have been highly <hi>improper,</hi> if a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
for Satan, and an Authority for thoſe Works of Darkneſs
had not been ſignified by them.</p>
                     <p>Next let us view the <hi>Extent</hi> of this Authority, both as to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
and <hi>Things.</hi> In relation to <hi>Perſons,</hi> the boundary of his
Kingdom reacheth as far as <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> he rules in the <hi>dark places
of the Earth,</hi> or the <hi>darkneſs of this World;</hi> and therefore his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is hence denominated a <hi>Kingdom of Darkneſs.</hi> This extends
(we may well imagine) as far as <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> reacheth, where he
is worſhipped as God, as far as any darkneſs of <hi>Mahumetaniſm</hi>
ſtretcheth it ſelf, as far as the darkneſs of <hi>Infidelity</hi> and blindneſs
upon the hearts of unconverted Men, which if ſummed up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
muſt needs take up the greateſt part of the World by far;
which is acknowledged, not only by that large Expreſſion,
<hi>World, Prince of this World,</hi> &amp;c. but alſo by that Prophetick
Speech of <hi>Rev. 11. 15. The Kingdoms of this World, are become the
Kingdoms of our Lord and his Chriſt;</hi> which acknowledgeth they
had not been ſo before, in the ſenſe wherein we now ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>Neither is his Kingdom ſo <hi>bounded,</hi> but that he alſo can
(when allowed) make <hi>Excurſions</hi> and Inroads into the Kingdom
of Chriſt, ſo far as to moleſt, diſturb and annoy his Subjects: as
the Kings of any Nation, beſides the Power which they Exerciſe
in their proper Juriſdiction, may moleſt their Neighbours. And
Chriſt <hi>ſo far</hi> permits this, as is <hi>uſeful</hi> to his <hi>own Deſigns,</hi> yet ſtill
with ſtraiter reſerves and limitations to Satan, and a reſolved reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue
and conqueſt for his own People.</p>
                     <p>If we enquire the Extent of his Power in relation <hi>to things,</hi>
we find the <hi>Air</hi> in a peculiar manner permitted to him, ſo that
he is named by it, as by one of his chief <hi>Royalties, the Prince of
the Power of the Air;</hi> we find alſo <hi>Death,</hi> with the Powers of it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49412:19"/>
given up to him, ſo that this is a <hi>peraphraſis</hi> of him, <hi>He that hath
the Power of Death,</hi> Heb. 2. 14. And if we take notice of his
large proffer to Chriſt of the Kingdoms of the World, <hi>All this
will I give thee;</hi> we may imagine that his Commiſſion reacheth
<hi>far</hi> this way, as <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Encouragements</hi> to his Service; which
we will the readilier entertain, when we find that by God's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
wicked Men have their <hi>Portion in this Life,</hi> and that
theſe are called <hi>their Good Things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly; Let us proceed a ſtep further to the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of this
Authority; which alſo,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Upon <hi>wicked Men</hi> is no leſs remarkable than is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
he is called the <hi>ſtrong Man</hi> in reference to their Hearts,
which he fortifies as ſo many <hi>Caſtles</hi> and <hi>Gariſons</hi> againſt God:
He alſo <hi>rules in them</hi> without controul; his Suggeſtions and
Temptations are as <hi>Laws</hi> to them;<note place="margin">Acts 5. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>he fills their Hearts</hi> with his
Deſigns, and raiſeth their Affections to an high and greedy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of them; he works in them, and by an inward force doth
hurry them on to atchieve his Enterpriſes;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 2.</note> In all this enſnaring
and captivating them <hi>at his pleaſure.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 26.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly; The <hi>Saints,</hi> which are Subjects of another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
are ſtill <hi>fearing,</hi> complaining, watching, praying, and
ſpreading out their hands, with lifting up their Eyes to Heaven
for help againſt him; they complain of violence and reſtleſs Aſſaults
from him; they are ſenſible that he can ſuggeſt evil thoughts, and
follow them with inceſſant Importunities; that he can draw a
darkneſs upon their Underſtanding, by bribing their Wills and
Affections againſt them; that he can diſturb their Duties, and
that becauſe of him they cannot do the good they would: many
a fear doth he beget in their Hearts; many a diſquiet hour have
they from him; their fleſh hath no reſt, and happy are they if
they eſcape from him without broken Bones: many excellent
ones have been caſt down by him, and for a time have been like
dead Men. 'Tis ſad to ſee ſo juſt a Perſon as <hi>Lot</hi> under his feet;
ſo choice a Saint as <hi>David</hi> wounded almoſt to the death; ſo high
an Apoſtle as <hi>Peter</hi> by force and fear from him, to open his Mouth
with Curſes and Imprecations in the denial of his Saviour;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note> to ſay
nothing of the Buffetings of others, which was ſufficiently wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſom
to <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowſ.</hi> Tract. Sacr. l. 2. c. 8. § 3.</note> and deſcribed by a <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh;</hi> which (if
a Learned Man think right) is compared by a Metaphor, to thoſe
ſharp Stakes upon which Chriſtians were cruelly ſpitted and burnt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49412:20"/>
Thirdly; His <hi>quick</hi> and ready accompliſhment, is a further
proof of the Efficacy of his Power. No ſooner had God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him a Commiſſion in reference to <hi>Job,</hi> but he <hi>quickly</hi> raiſeth
the Tempeſt, brings down the Houſe, ſlayes his Children, brings
Fire from Heaven; and (which would ſeem ſtrange) hath the
Troops of the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> at his beck, as if they had
been liſted under his known Command; ſo that in a little time he
puts his Malice into Act.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly; If any would ſlight all this, as being the Force of
<hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> againſt <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood:</hi> We may ſee he
hath ſo much ſtrength and confidence, as to grapple with an
<hi>Angel of Light,</hi> as he did in the conteſting for <hi>Moſes</hi> his Body,
<hi>Jude v.</hi> 9. This was a <hi>Created Angel,</hi> elſe he durſt not ſure have
brought a <hi>railing Accuſation;</hi> but in that he ſtrove, and raylingly
accuſed, it ſhews he wanted not a daring boldneſs to ſecond his
Commiſſion and Power.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly; It will be alſo requiſite to lay open the <hi>Advantages</hi>
he hath in the management of all this Power, which are great:
As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>multitude</hi> of Devils: That there are many, is not
denyed, upon the evidence of <hi>ſeven</hi> caſt out of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi>
and the <hi>Legion</hi> which were ſetled in one poor Man at once. It
may be we may not credit the Devil's own account of his ſtrength
ſo much, as to believe that their number was <hi>exactly</hi> anſwerable
to a <hi>Roman Legion,</hi> which (if ſome ſpeak right) was 6666: yet
there being ſo plain an alluſion to a <hi>Roman</hi> Legion; and the
Scripture in the recital favouring it ſo far, as to conſent to a
truth in that part of the Story, we can do no leſs than conclude
that the number of Devils in that Perſon was a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and ſo great, that the ſimilitude of Legion was proper to
expreſs it by. Beſides, if the Scripture had been ſilent in this
particular, our Reaſon would have clearly drawn that concluſion
from ſuch premiſes as theſe, That he is the <hi>God of the World,</hi> and
rules in the <hi>Children of Diſobedience;</hi> for whatſoever we conceive
of his Power, we cannot think him <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> or <hi>Omnipreſent,</hi>
theſe being the <hi>incommunicable Attributes</hi> of the great Creator of
all things, in which no Creature can ſhare with God. Being
then aſſured that he is the Tempter of all Men, and that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be in all places at once, we muſt needs apprehend the Devils
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49412:20"/>
to be many, as is ſignified by that expreſſion, the <hi>Devil and his
Angels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly; He hath alſo an advantage for the executing of his
Deſigns, from that <hi>Order,</hi> which from the fore-mentioned grounds
we muſt be forced to conceive to be among Devils. I know the
bold determination of the Order of Angels by <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> is juſtly
rejected,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. <hi>Enchir.</hi> c. 58.</note> not only by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> but alſo by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Proteſtants, who upon that, and other grounds of like
preſumption, do reject that Author as not being the <hi>true Dyoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
the <hi>Areopagite.</hi> Neither do ſome of our Proteſtant Authors
(as <hi>Chamier</hi> and others) admit the Government of Angels to
be <hi>Monarchical,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

(which ſuppoſition the <hi>Papiſts</hi> would gladly
make uſe of, as a Foundation whereon to eſtabliſh the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal
Headſhip</hi> of the <hi>Pope)</hi> being a thing which <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> himſelf, (as
<hi>Chamier</hi> affirms) never dream'd of: Yet do none of theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
deny an Order among the Angels, but willingly grant it, as
clearly implyed from the term <hi>Arch-Angel</hi> uſed by <hi>Paul,</hi>

4. 16. and from their being called <hi>God's Hoſt</hi> or Army, where
Order is neceſſary for the right management of their ſtrength,
and confuſion the way to the ruin of their deſigns! The thing
they diſlike is, the bold and peremptory determination of the
<hi>particular Orders</hi> among them,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cal.</hi> Inſtit. l. 1. c. 14. §. 8.</note> and the <hi>aſſignment</hi> of the ſeveral
Charges, Imployments and Stations to each; which whoſoever
ſhall do, muſt needs be guilty of <hi>intruding into things which he
hath not ſeen.</hi> It would upon the ſame ſcore be a preſumptuous
folly to make ſuch a determination of the ſeveral Ranks and
particular Imployments of Devils: Yet this hindereth not, but
with a warrantable ſobriety we may believe in the general, that
there is <hi>an Order</hi> among the Devils. Not only do theſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<hi>(Baalzebub the Prince of Divils,</hi>

                        <hi>the Devil and his Angels,</hi> and
in that they are called, <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers)</hi> warrant us ſo
to think; but the fore-mentioned Conſiderations about the <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi>
of Devils, will force our Reaſon to an aſſent: for if they
muſt be many, becauſe all Mankind is ſenſible of their Aſſaults,
they muſt have alſo an Order in the management of their Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
without which, their Deſigns of Cruelty and Malice
muſt (at leaſt in great part) fall to the ground. Neither do I
know well, how thoſe Authors may be juſtly blamed, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
a little further in their Suppoſitions,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Baynes</hi> ibid.</note> to tell us (as moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable)
That theſe Infernal Spirits do <hi>ſhare</hi> the <hi>World</hi> among
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49412:21"/>
them, and are alloted to ſeveral Countries and Places, as their
own proper Charge and Juriſdiction; for what other Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
thoſe Paſſages in <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 13. can receive, I cannot ſee,
<hi>The Prince of the Kingdom of</hi> Perſia <hi>withſtanding the Angel one and
twenty days;</hi> and his help in that oppoſition from <hi>Michael,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
(if things be well weighed) be properly underſtood of
<hi>Cambyſes</hi> the Son of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> or a conteſt with any Man. However
if we let this go, as a thing uncertain,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Calvin</hi> in loc.</note> (becauſe this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is denyed by ſome) yet that which is ſpoken of their Order
in the general, and the advantage theſe Spirits have againſt us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Conſideration, ſeems to be paſt denyal.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly; The advantage of <hi>place</hi> among Armies is reckoned
much. Satan ſeems to have ſomething this way as an advantage
of <hi>Ground,</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly; But his greateſt advantage is from his Knowledg,
which I ſhall a little explain in the following Chapter.</p>

is far greater: <hi>Two</hi> notable diſcoveries we have of <hi>Adam</hi>'s

of the aptneſs of Names impoſed on Creatures, made
<hi>Plato</hi> acknowledg, That it was a work above ordinary capacity.
The other diſcovery of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Knowledg, was his knowledg of
the <hi>Original</hi> of <hi>Eve</hi> at firſt ſight; <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23. he ſaid, <hi>This is now
Bone of my Bones, and Fleſh of my Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. This Inſtance <hi>Luther</hi>
made uſe of to prove the knowledg that we ſhall have of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Heaven; which ſhews that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Underſtanding was
then incomparably more ſublime than ours, and of a nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the knowledg which a ſtate of Glory ſhall furniſh us
withal. To this might be added a further proof from the rare
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49412:22"/>
                        <hi>Inventions,</hi> and excellent Diſcoveries that ſome raiſed Wits have
made, of things that have laid deep, and far out of the view of
common Capacities. As alſo thoſe <hi>views,</hi> ſights, and more than
ordinary comprehenſions which the Souls of Men have had, when
they were a little freed from the clog and hinderance of the Body,
either in <hi>Extaſies,</hi> or by <hi>approaching</hi> Death; all which put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
will go far to prove a very great meaſure of Knowledg in
Satan, if we take along with us this Foundation, That in all the
Works of God, we find the <hi>higheſt Knowledg</hi> in the <hi>nobleſt Being:</hi>
Living Creatures are more excellent than Stones or Trees, and
therefore hath God furniſhed them with Senſes, and hath alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
them by higher degrees of Sagacity, according to their
excellency above others: Thus the Ape, Fox, Elephant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
have ſuch Abilities above the Worm and Fly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſome have
queſtioned whether they had not ſome lower degrees of Reaſon
Yet as theſe are below Man, ſo doth his Reaſon far excel their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
quickneſs of Senſe. Angels are an higher Being than Man, (for
he made him <hi>lower than the Angels)</hi> and conſequently their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
is proportionably greater. So that if <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency
underſtood the Nature of Things, how much more exactly and
fully muſt we imagine Satan to know them?</p>
                     <p>Secondly; But the Proof is more full and direct, from thoſe
<hi>Appellations</hi> and Titles which the Scripture, and the Experience
of Men,<note place="margin">quaſi <gap reason="foreign">

(in <hi>Matth. 8. 31. Mark 5. 12. Rev. 16. 14.)</hi> we tranſlate Devil,
properly ſignifieth one that is <hi>wiſe,</hi> knowing, or skilful. And
however the wickedneſs of that Spirit hath ſo far diſhonoured this
word, that 'tis always (as ſome think) uſed to ſignifie <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean

                     <p>Thirdly; To both the former, may be added another Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg;

Expreſſions, God is careful to reſerve this to himſelf, <hi>I the Lord
do it,</hi> or <hi>I am he</hi> that ſearcheth; and ſignifies, that none elſe is
able to do the like.</p>
                     <p>Yet Satan can do <hi>much</hi> this way:<note place="margin">Anſw. 2.</note> for if we conſider how he
can come ſo <hi>near</hi> to our Spirits, as to <hi>communicate</hi> his Injections
to us, and that he often entertains a <hi>Diſpute</hi> with us in this ſecret
way of acceſs that he hath to our Thoughts; if we obſerve his
<hi>Arguings,</hi> his <hi>Anſwers</hi> and <hi>Replys</hi> to our refuſals, ſo <hi>direct,</hi> ſo <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,</hi>
ſo <hi>continued,</hi> we ſhall be conſtrained to grant that he can
do more this way than is commonly imagined. That I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
this with a due reſpect to God's Prerogative of knowing
the Heart, I ſhall,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Shew that there are <hi>two</hi> things which are clearly out of
Satan's reach. (1.) Our <hi>future Thoughts,</hi> he cannot tell what
ſhall be our Thoughts for time to come, he may poſſibly adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49412:23"/>
to tell what <hi>Suggeſtions</hi> he <hi>reſolves</hi> to put into our Hearts,
but what ſhall be our <hi>Reſolves</hi> and <hi>Determinations</hi> thereupon, he
knows not: This is ſingled out as one part of God's Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
that he knoweth the <hi>determinate Purpoſes</hi> and Reſolves of the
Heart aforehand, becauſe he turneth the Heart as he pleaſeth,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1. (2.) Our <hi>preſent formed Thoughts,</hi> the immediate
and imminent Acts of the Mind he cannot <hi>directly</hi> ſee into: He
may tell what <hi>floating Thinkings</hi> he hath put into our Heart, but
our own proper Thoughts, or <hi>formed Reſolves,</hi> he cannot <hi>directly</hi>
view; this is alſo particularly inſiſted on as proper to God alone.
John 2. 24, 25. <hi>Chriſt knew all Men,</hi> ſo directly, that <hi>he needed not
that any ſhould teſtifie of Man,</hi> (this Satan ſtands in need of; he
ſometimes knows Men and their Thoughts, but he <hi>needs</hi> a <hi>Sign</hi>
or notification of theſe Thoughts, and cannot <hi>immediately</hi> look
into them); the reaſon why Chriſt needed not this, is rendred
thus,<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>for he knew what was in Man;</hi> that is, <hi>intuitively</hi> he knew
his Thoughts, and could immediately read them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I ſhall endeavour to explain <hi>how</hi> much, or how far
he can <hi>pry</hi> into our Thoughts. Several things are granted which
argue Satan can go a great way toward a diſcovery: As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Jeniſon's</hi> height of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels Idolatry, <hi>p.</hi> 35.</note> That he knows the <hi>Objects in our Fancy,</hi> or Phantaſins,
and this as clearly as we do behold things with our Eyes; and the
proof given hereof is this, That there are <hi>Diabolical Dreams,</hi> in
which the Devil cannot create <hi>new Species,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Goodwin</hi> Child of Light, <hi>p.</hi> 65.</note> and ſuch as our Senſes
were never acquainted withal, (as to make a Blind Man dream
of Colours) but that he can only call forth and ſet in order thoſe
Objects, of which our Imagination doth retain the Shadows or
Impreſſions; and this he could not do, if he did not viſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them in our fancy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, 'Tis certain he knows his <hi>own Suggeſtions,</hi> and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
darted into our Minds; upon which, he can at <hi>preſent</hi>
know what our Thoughts are buſied upon.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He knows the <hi>ſecret workings</hi> of our <hi>Paſſions,</hi> as Love,
Deſire, F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the motions of the Blood and Spirits, which he can
eaſily diſcern, though their motions and workings may be kept
ſecret from the obſervation of all by-ſtanders.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Queſt. pereg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſuppoſing that he knows what is in our Thoughts at any time,
only he knows not <hi>to what</hi> theſe Thoughts <hi>incline:</hi> but I leave
this to thoſe that can determine it certainly. In the mean time
I proceed,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To ſhew what a gueſſing Faculty he hath of what he
doth <hi>not directly</hi> know; he hath ſuch grounds and advantages
for Conjecture, that he ſeldom fails of finding our Mind: As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, His long <hi>experience</hi> hath taught him, what <hi>uſually</hi> Men do
think, in ſuch caſes as are commonly before them; by a cunning
<hi>obſervation</hi> of their Actions and Ways he knows this.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; He by ſtudy and obſervation knows <hi>our temper</hi> and
inclination, and conſequently what Temptations do moſt ſute
them, and how we do ordinarily entertain them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly; He knows this the more, by taking notice of our
<hi>Prayers,</hi> our complainings and mournings over our defects and
miſcarriages.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly; He is quick and ready to take notice of any <hi>Exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Sign,</hi> by which the Mind is ſignified, as the <hi>Pulſe,</hi> the <hi>motion</hi>
of the Body, the <hi>change</hi> of the Countenance; all which do uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſhew the aſſent or diſſent of the Mind,<note place="margin">—deprehendas animit tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta latentis ex aegrotorum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what entertainment his Offers have in our Thoughts.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly; Being ſo quick-ſighted, he can underſtand thoſe <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Signs</hi> which would eſcape the obſervation of the wiſeſt
Men; there are ſome things ſmall in themſelves, (and therefore
unobſerved) which yet to wiſe Men are very great <hi>indicia</hi> of
things; the like may be ſaid of us, in reference to our inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
our acceptance or reſiſtance of Temptations, which yet he
hath curiouſly marked out.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly; No doubt but he hath ways to <hi>put us upon a diſcovery</hi>
of our Thoughts, while we conceal them, as by continuing and
proſecuting Temptations or Suggeſtions, till our trouble or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
do ſome way diſcover how it is with us. By all which it
appears that his gueſſings and conjectures do ſeldom fail him.
'Tis now time to ſpeak to the other Queſtion, which is,</p>
                     <p>Whether and how far Satan knows things to come?<note place="margin">Queſt. 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I ſhall return Anſwer in theſe two Concluſions.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt;<note place="margin">1. Concluſion.</note> There is a way of knowing future things, which is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the knowledg</hi> of Devils, and <hi>proper</hi> only to <hi>God,</hi> Eſa. 41. 23.
there God puts the competition 'twixt Himſelf and <hi>Idols,</hi> about
the truth of a <hi>Diety</hi> upon this iſſue, That <hi>he that can ſhew the things
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49412:24"/>
that are to come hereafter, he is God;</hi> which becauſe they cannot do,
he doth hereby evince them to be no Gods. If Satan could truly
and properly have done this, he had had a Plea for a <hi>Godhead.</hi>
In Divine Predictions two things are to be conſidered. (1.) The
<hi>Matter</hi> foretold, when the events of things <hi>contingent,</hi> and (as
to <hi>ſecond</hi> Cauſes) <hi>caſual,</hi> depending upon <hi>indeterminate</hi> Cauſes,
are foretold. (2.) The <hi>Manner,</hi> when theſe things are not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly,</hi>
or <hi>conjecturally,</hi> or darkly; but <hi>clearly, certainly, infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>
and <hi>fully</hi> predicted. Of this nature are Divine Predictions,
which Satan cannot perform, nor yet the Angels in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">2. Concluſion.</note> Yet Satan hath ſuch advantages for the knowledg
of future Things, and ſuch means and helps for a diſcovery of
them, that his Conjectures have often come to paſs.</p>
                     <p>Firſt; He knows the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Things, which are <hi>ſecret</hi> to us.
Upon which he ſeems to foretel many things ſtrange to us; As a
<hi>Phyſician</hi> may foretel the <hi>Effects,</hi> Workings, and Iſſues of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
as ſeeing them in the <hi>Cauſes:</hi> which would paſs for little
leſs than <hi>Propheſie</hi> among the Vulgar. Thus an <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> foretells
<hi>Eclipſes,</hi> which would be taken for a <hi>Divine Excellency,</hi> where the
knowledg of the ground of theſe foretellings had not taken away
the wonder.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; Many things are made known to him by <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Divine Revelation:</hi> We know not the intercourſe betwixt God
and Satan in the matter of <hi>Job;</hi> Satan (having obtained his
Commiſſion to afflict him) might have made a long propheſie of
what ſhould come to paſs in reference to <hi>Job,</hi> his Children and
Subſtance; how many ſuch Predictions he might make, we little
know.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly; He hath a deep <hi>inſight</hi> in <hi>Affairs</hi> of Kingdoms and
States, and ſo might (from his Experience and Obſervation)
eaſily conjecture <hi>Mutations</hi> and Alterations. A Politician may do
much this way: for ought we know, Satan's Propheſy (in the
likeneſs of <hi>Samuel)</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> of his ruin, and the tranſlation of
his Kingdom to <hi>David,</hi> might be no more than a conjectural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
from his comparing the order of the preſent Providence,
with former threatnings and promiſes.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly; He hath a greater underſtanding of <hi>Scripture Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,</hi>
than ordinarily the wiſeſt of Men have; ſo that at <hi>ſecond
hand</hi> he might be able to foretel what ſhall come to paſs. Whilſt
we that do not ſo clearly ſee into Scripture-Predictions, may not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49412:25"/>
be able to find out the matter.<note place="margin">Invictus etis Alexander. Plutarch in vit Alexandri.</note> Hence by <hi>Oracle</hi> he foretoled <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>

Chap. 11. long before.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly; He hath advantage from his Nature as <hi>a Spirit,</hi> by
which he <hi>over-hears</hi> and <hi>ſees</hi> the <hi>private</hi> Actings, Complottings
and Preparations of Men in reference to certain Undertakings,

in <hi>remote</hi> Countries and Kingdoms, which muſt paſs for
real Predictions, if the event anſwer accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly; He can <hi>foretel</hi> (and with probability of ſucceſs)
ſuch things as he by temptation is about to <hi>put Men upon,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſeeing he can chuſe ſuch Inſtruments, as he (from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
knows are not likely to fail his Enterpriſe.</p>

(1.) That this word is ranked with others, (as

done by the <hi>help</hi> of Satan, in an <hi>unuſual</hi> way, as

                        <note place="margin">Godwin <hi>Jews Antiq.</hi> l. 4. c. 10. <hi>Pool</hi> in loc.</note> will tell us that this Witch muſt be <hi>a Diviner,</hi> Divination
being the <hi>general</hi> tearm, comprehending the <hi>ſeven</hi> Particulars
following: It would be an harſh ſtraining to put in the Poyſoner
(in the ſenſe of our Oppoſites) among the Diviners. Yet the
ſecond Argument is more cogent, which is this; That among
thoſe whom <hi>Pharaoh</hi> called together to encounter with <hi>Moſes,
Exod.</hi> 7. 11. we find <hi>Witches</hi> or Sorcerers expreſſed by the ſame
word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which is uſed in <hi>Exodus</hi> 22. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.
What can more certainly fix the interpretation of the Word
than this place, where the end of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> calling them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was not to <hi>poyſon Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> but by <hi>Enchantment</hi> to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49412:26"/>
                        <hi>outvy</hi> them in point of Miracles. Which will ſhew that Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
is not Poyſoning, but the doing of ſtrange Acts by the aid
of Satan. Neither was this the act of one Man, (who might
poſſibly, together with that preſent Age, be under a miſtake
concerning Witches, though it be a thing not to be ſuppoſed)
but long after him, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 4. being aſtoniſhed
with his Dreams,<note place="margin">Witchcraft reckoned as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from Murther, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 20, 21.</note> calls for the <hi>Sorcerers</hi> or <hi>Witches,</hi> and <hi>Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
to give him the Interpretation; which had been a matter
very improper for them, if their skill had lain only in mixing
Poyſons.</p>
                     <p>When we have thus ſilenced this Imagination, we have yet
another to encounter with, and that is of thoſe that think theſe
Witches, of which the forecited Texts do ſpeak, are but meer
<hi>Cheats,</hi> and by ſome tricks of Deluſion and <hi>Legerdemain,</hi> pretend
they can do things, which indeed they cannot do at all; and yet
finding death threatned to ſuch, which (in a buſineſs of meer
Jugling) would ſeem too great a ſeverity,<note place="margin">Scot. <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft.</hi> l. 6. c. 2.</note> they have framed this
anſwer to it, That the death is threatned, not for the <hi>jugling,</hi>
but for their <hi>preſumptuous</hi> and <hi>blaſphemous</hi> undertaking to do things
that belong to a <hi>Divine Power,</hi> and for <hi>taking his Name in vain.</hi> Or
(as others are pleaſed to ſay) though they have <hi>no real</hi> power,<note place="margin">Hobs <hi>Leviath.</hi> c. 2. p. 7.</note>
they are juſtly puniſhed for the <hi>belief</hi> they have, that they can do
ſuch miſchief, joyned with their <hi>purpoſe</hi> to do it, if they can.</p>
                     <p>In Anſwer to this apprehenſion, I ſhall not much inſiſt upon

                           <hi>Teneſon. Hobs</hi> Creed. Exam. Art. 4. p. 63.</note> which yet are ſufficiently weak, (the <hi>latter</hi> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

them of <hi>unneceſſary redundancy,</hi> ſeeing enough in other places is
provided againſt Blaſphemers) but ſhall offer a Conſideration or
two, which I judg will be of force to rectifie the Miſtake.</p>
                     <p>Firſt; Though it cannot be denyed, but that a great many
Cheats there have been in all Ages, by which Men have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to raiſe the repute and eſteem of their own Skill and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
or for other baſe ends; yet form hence to conclude,
that <hi>all theſe things</hi> that have been done under the name of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49412:28"/>
not able to give a particular account of theſe <hi>under-ground</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
yet thus much we may ſay,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That in many Caſes, his great Acts, that paſs for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
are no more but <hi>deceptions of Senſe. Naturaliſts</hi> have
ſhewn ſeveral Feats and <hi>Knacks</hi> of this kind.<note place="margin">Magia Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis. l. 2. c. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>Jo. Bap. Porta</hi> hath
a great many ways of ſuch deceptions, by <hi>Lamps,</hi> and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Compoſitions of <hi>Oyls,</hi> by which not only the colours of things
are changed, but Men appear without Heads, or with the Heads
of Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The like Deceptions are wrought by <hi>Glaſſes</hi> of
various Figures and Shapes. If Art can do ſuch things, much
more can Satan.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; He can mightily work upon the <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi>
by which means Men are abuſed into a belief of things
that are not: as in Dreams, the Fancy preſents things which are
really imagined to be done and ſaid; when-as they are Viſions of
the Night, which vaniſh when the Man is awake; or as in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy</hi>
Perſons, the Fancy of Men doth ſo ſtrongly impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, that they believe ſtrange abſurd things of themſelves,
that they have <hi>Horns</hi> on their Head, that they are made of <hi>Glaſs,</hi>
that they are <hi>dead,</hi> and what not: If Fancy, both aſleep and
awake, may thus abuſe Men into an apprehenſion of impoſſible
things, and that with confidence, no wonder if Satan (whoſe
Power reacheth thus far, as was before proved) doth take this
advantage for the amuſing of Men with ſtrange things. <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>
his Judgment, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 25. whereby he was <hi>driven
from Men, and eat Graſs as Oxen,</hi> was not a <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> or real
change into an Ox; this all Expoſitors rejects as too hard; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeems it to be only his <hi>extream neceſſity,</hi> and low eſtate,
whereby he ſeemed to be little better than a Beaſt,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Calvin</hi> in loc.</note> (though
<hi>Calvin</hi> favour this Interpretation); but by that Expreſſion,
verſ. 25. <hi>[then my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding came to me]</hi> it ſeems evident,
(as moſt Commentators think) that his Underſtanding was ſo
<hi>changed</hi> in that Puniſhment, that he <hi>imagined</hi> himſelf to be a
<hi>Beaſt,</hi> and behaved himſelf accordingly, by eating Graſs, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the open Fields. There are ſeveral Stories to this purpoſe
of ſtrange Transformations,<note place="margin">Civit. Dei. l. 18. c. 18.</note> as the Bodies of Men into <hi>Aſſes,</hi> and
other Beaſts, which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thinks to be nothing elſe but the
Devils Power upon the Fancy.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly; There are wonderful <hi>Secrets in Nature,</hi> which if
cunningly uſed and applyed to <hi>fit Things</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> muſt needs
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49412:29"/>
amaze vulgar Heads; and though ſome of theſe are known to
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Scholars,</hi> yet are there many ſecret Things
lock'd from the wiſeſt Men, whoſe Powers, and Natures, becauſe
they know not,<note place="margin">De Civit. Dei lib. 21. c. 5, 6.</note> they may alſo be deluded by them. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>

If Men by ſuch helps find ſuch eaſy ways to delude Men, What
exactneſs of Workmanſhip, and ſeeming Wonders may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from Satan upon ſuch Advantages?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly; Many of his Wonders may challenge an <hi>higher riſe.</hi>
Satan knows the ſecret ways of <hi>Natures Operations,</hi> and the ways
of <hi>accelerating</hi> or <hi>retarding</hi> thoſe Works. So that he cannot only
do what Nature can do,<note place="margin">Determinata activa ad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminata paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiva applican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</note> by a due application of <hi>active</hi> to <hi>paſſive
Principles,</hi> and the help of thoſe <hi>Seminal</hi> Powers that are in
Things, but he may be ſuppoſed to perform them in a <hi>quicker</hi> and
more expeditious manner: Thus <hi>Worms, Flies,</hi> and <hi>Serpents,</hi>
that are bred of Putrefaction, Satan may ſpeedily produce;
And who can tell how far this help may reach in his Works of
Wonders?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly; The <hi>ſecret</hi> way of Satan's <hi>Movings</hi> and <hi>Actings</hi> is no
ſmall matter in theſe Affairs. How many things do common
<hi>Juglers</hi> by the <hi>ſwift motions</hi> of their Hands, that ſeem incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
Thus they make the By-ſtanders believe they change the
Subſtances, Natures, and Forms of Things, when they only,
by a <hi>ſpeedy Conveyance,</hi> take theſe things away, and put others in
their room. They that ſhall conſider Satan as a Spirit, ſubtil,
imperceptible, quick of Motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will eaſily believe him to
be more accompliſhed for ſuch Conveyances than all the Men in
the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:49412:29"/>
Having now ſeen the way of his Wonders, let us next conſider
the advantage he hath by ſuch Actions. If we look upon <hi>Simon
Magus,</hi> Acts 8. 10, 11. we find, that he by theſe ways, had a
general influence upon the People; <hi>To him they all gave heed, from
the leaſt to the greateſt;</hi> and that his Actions were reckoned no
leſs than Miraculous, as done by the mighty Power of God. If
we go from hence to the <hi>Magicians</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 7. 11. 'tis
ſaid, <hi>They did ſo with their Inchantments,</hi> which (howſoever the
matter was) prevailed ſo with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Court, that they
ſaw no difference 'twixt the Wonders done by <hi>Moſes</hi> and them,
ſave that (it may be) they thought <hi>Moſes</hi> the more skilful <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician.</hi>
But beſides this, if we conſider what they did, it will
argue much for his Power,<note place="margin">Tho. Cajatan Delrio.</note> if we can imagine (as ſome do)
that they turned their <hi>Rods</hi> into <hi>real</hi> Serpents, the Power is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
and there is this that favours that Opinion, it is ſaid, They
<hi>could not make Lice,</hi> which ſeems to imply, they <hi>really</hi> did the
other things, and it had been as eaſy to <hi>delude</hi> the Senſes in the
matter of <hi>Lice,</hi> as in the <hi>Rods,</hi> if it had been no more than a
Deluſion; neither are ſome a-wanting to give a reaſon of ſuch a
Power, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Serpents, Lice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being the Off-ſpring of
Putrefaction, by his dextrous application of the ſeminal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of things,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Barth. Sybilla</hi> Pereg. Quaeſt. p. 372. <hi>Rivetus.</hi>
                        </note> he might quickly produce them. If we go lower,
and take up with the Opinion of thoſe, that think that they
were neither <hi>meer Deluſions,</hi> nor yet <hi>true Serpents,</hi> but <hi>real Bodies
like Serpents,</hi> though <hi>without life,</hi> this will argue a very great
Power: Or if we ſuppoſe (as ſome do) that Satan <hi>took away</hi>
the Rods, and ſecretly <hi>conveyed</hi> Serpents in their ſtead, or (which
is the loweſt apprehenſion we can have) that <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s ſight was
<hi>deceived:</hi> The matter is ſtill far from being contemptible, for as
much as we ſee, the Spectators were not able to diſcern the
Cheat.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly;<note place="margin">Apparitions.</note> The next <hi>Inſtance</hi> produceable for evidencing his
Power, is that of <hi>Apparitions.</hi> It cannot be denyed, but that the
<hi>Fancy</hi> of melancholick or timerous Perſons, is fruitful enough
to <hi>create</hi> a thouſand <hi>Bugbears.</hi> And alſo that the <hi>villany</hi> of ſome
Perſons hath been deſignedly imployed to deceive People with
<hi>Mock-Apparitions;</hi> of which abundance of Inſtances might be
given from the <hi>knavery</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> diſcovered to the World
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49412:30"/>
beyond contradiction; but all this will not conclude, that there
are <hi>no real Appearances</hi> of Spirit or Devils. Such ſad effects in
all Ages there have been of theſe things, that moſt Men will
take it for an undenyable Truth.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of others, let the Apparition at <hi>Endor</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> come
to examination: Some indeed will have us believe, that all that

be denyed, but that many judg it was true <hi>Samuel,</hi> but their
Reaſons are weak.</p>
                     <p>(1.) That Proof from <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 46. 23. is not <hi>Canonical</hi>
with us.</p>
                     <p>(2.) That he was <hi>called Samuel</hi> is of no force; Scripture of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
gives names of things according to their appearances.</p>
                     <p>(3.) That things future were foretold, was but from <hi>conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;</hi>
in which Satan yet (all things conſidered) had <hi>good ground</hi>
for his <hi>gueſſing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(4.) That the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is oft repeated, ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
the Devil is not ſo ſcarce of words; <hi>Jeſus I know,</hi> ſaith
that Spirit in the <hi>Acts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(5.) That he <hi>reproved</hi> Sin in <hi>Saul,</hi> is no more than what the
Devil doth daily to <hi>afflicted Conſciences</hi> in order to deſpair.</p>
                     <p>I muſt go then with thoſe that believe this was <hi>Satan</hi> in <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>'s

And 'tis too harſh to think he would ſend <hi>Samuel</hi> from the Dead,

                     <p>(2.) This (if it had been <hi>Samuel)</hi> would have given too

(3.) The <hi>prediction</hi> of <hi>Sauls</hi> Death, though true for <hi>ſubſtance,</hi>
yet failed as to the <hi>exactneſs</hi> of time, for the Battel was not
fought the next day.</p>
                     <p>(4.) The acknowledgment of the Witches Power, <hi>[Why

Power of Witchcraft not being able to reach Souls at reſt with
God.</p>
                     <p>(5.) That Expreſſion of <hi>Gods aſcending out of the Earth,</hi> is
evidently ſuſpicious.</p>
                     <p>The reality of Apparitions being thus eſtabliſhed, Satan's
Power will be eaſily evinced from it. To ſay nothing of the
Bodies in which Spirits appear; the haunting of Places and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and the other Effects done by ſuch Appearances, ſpeak
abundantly for it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly;<note place="margin">Poſſeſſions.</note> The laſt Inſtance is of <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi> the reality of
which can no way be queſtioned, becauſe the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
ſo much for it; I ſhall only note ſome things as concerning
this Head. As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt; The <hi>multitudes</hi> of Men poſſeſſed: ſcarce was there any
thing in which Chriſt had more opportunities to ſhew his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
than in caſting out of Satan; ſuch Objects of Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
he met with in every place.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; The <hi>multitudes</hi> of Spirits in <hi>one</hi> Perſon, is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
not to be paſſed by.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly; Theſe Perſons were often <hi>ſtrongly</hi> acted, ſometime
with <hi>fierceneſs</hi> and rage, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 28. ſome living without
<hi>Cloaths,</hi> and without <hi>Houſe,</hi> Luke 8. 27. ſome by an incredible
ſtrength <hi>breaking Chains and Fetters,</hi> Mark 5. 3.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly; Some time the Poſſeſſed were ſadly <hi>vexed</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
caſt <hi>into the Fire</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly; Some were <hi>ſtrengely influenced:</hi> we read of one,
<hi>Acts</hi> 16. 16. that had <hi>a Spirit of Divination,</hi> and told many
things to come, which we may ſuppoſe frequently came to paſs;
elſe ſhe could have brought <hi>no gain to her Maſter by South-ſaying.</hi>
Another we hear of, whoſe Poſſeſſion was with a <hi>Lunacy,</hi> and had
fits at certain times and ſeaſons. The Poſſeſſed Perſon with
whom Mr. <hi>Rothwell</hi> diſcourſed,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid.</hi> Clark<hi>'s</hi> Lives.</note> (within the memory of ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving)
could play the <hi>Critick</hi> in the Hebrew Language.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:49412:31"/>
Sixthly; In ſome the Poſſeſſion was ſo ſtrong, and ſo <hi>firmly
ſeated,</hi> that <hi>ordinary means</hi> and ways could not diſpoſſeſs them:
<hi>This kind comes not out but by Prayer and Faſting,</hi> Mat. 27. 21. which
ſhews that all Poſſeſſion was not of one kind and manner, nor
alike lyable to ejection.</p>
                     <p>To all theſe may be added <hi>Obſeſſions:</hi> where the Devil afflicts
the Bodies of Men, diſquiets them, haunts them, or ſtrikes in
with their melancholy temper, and ſo annoys by hideous and
black repreſentations. Thus was <hi>Saul</hi> vexed by <hi>an evil Spirit from
the Lord,</hi> which (as moſt conceive) was the Devil working in
his <hi>melancholy Humor.</hi> That the Devil ſhould take poſſeſſion of
the Bodies of Men, and thus act, drive, trouble and diſtreſs them;
ſo diſtort, diſtend, and rack their Members; ſo ſeat himſelf in their
Tongues and Minds, that a Man cannot command his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and Powers, but ſeems to be rather changed into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Devil, than to retain any thing of a Man; this ſhews
a Power in him to be trembled at.</p>
                     <p>Satan's Power being thus explained and proved, I ſhall next
ſpeak ſomething of his Cruelty.</p>

His cruel handling of his Slaves.</head>
                     <p>HE that ſhall conſider his Malice and Power, muſt unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably
conclude him to be <hi>cruel. Malice</hi> is always ſo, where
it hath the advantage of a <hi>proportionable</hi> ſtrength and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the effecting of its hateful Contrivances: It baniſheth all
pity and commiſeration, and follows only the dictate of its
own rage with ſuch fierceneſs, that it is only limited by wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
power to execute. We may then ſay of Satan, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Malice and Power ſuch in his Cruelty. The truth
of this will be abundantly manifeſted by Inſtances: As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, From his deſperate <hi>purſuits</hi> of Advantage, upon thoſe
whoſe Spirits are <hi>wounded.</hi> The anguiſh of a diſtreſſed Conſcience
is unſpeakably great, in ſo much, that many are (as <hi>Heman,</hi>
Pſalm. 88. 15.) <hi>even diſtracted, while they ſuffer the Terrors of the
Almighty.</hi> Theſe though they look round about them for help,
and invite all that paſs by to pity them, <hi>becauſe the hand of the
Lord hath touched them;</hi> yet Satan <hi>laughs</hi> at their <hi>Calamity,</hi> and
<hi>mocks</hi> at them under their <hi>Fears,</hi> and doth all he can to augment the
flame: he ſuggeſts dreadful thoughts of an incenſed Majeſty;
begets terrible apprehenſions of Infinite Wrath and Damnation;
he aggravates all their Sins, to make them ſeem unpardonable:
every <hi>Action</hi> he calls a <hi>Sin,</hi> and every <hi>Sin</hi> he repreſents as a <hi>willful</hi>
forſaking of God; and every <hi>deliberate</hi> Tranſgreſſion he tells
them is <hi>the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> He <hi>baffles</hi> them in their
Prayers and Services, and then <hi>accuſeth</hi> their Duties for intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
prophanations of God's Name; and if they be at laſt affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from them, he then clamours that they are <hi>forſaken of God,</hi>
becauſe they have forſaken him: He (as <hi>a right Baalzebub)</hi>
rakes in their Wounds, as Flies are ever ſucking where there is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49412:32"/>
a Sore. Their Outcrys and Lamentations are ſuch Muſick to
him, that he gives them no reſt; and with ſuch triumph doth
he tread upon thoſe that thus lie in the Duſt, that he makes them
ſometimes accuſe themſelves for that which they <hi>never did,</hi> and
in deriſion he inſults over them in their greateſt perplexities,
with this, <hi>Where is now thy God?</hi> and <hi>who ſhall deliver thee out of
my hand?</hi> This were enough to evidence him altogether void of
compaſſion. But,</p>
                     <p>Secondly; He ſhews no leſs cruelty in his <hi>uſage</hi> of thoſe that
are his <hi>Slaves.</hi> The Service that he exacts of thoſe that are his
moſt willing Servants, is no leſs than the higheſt cruelty; and
not only (1.) in regard of the <hi>miſery</hi> and deſtruction which he
makes them work out for themſelves, (which is far greater, than
where Men are forced by the moſt brutiſh Tyrants, to <hi>buy their
own Poyſon,</hi> or to <hi>cut their own Throats;</hi> becauſe this is unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
leſs than the endleſs miſeries of eternal Torments): but
(2.) alſo in regard of the very ſlavery and <hi>drudging toyl</hi> of the
Service which he exacts from them; he is not pleaſed that they
<hi>Sin,</hi> but the <hi>vileſt</hi> Iniquities, moſt contrary to God, and moſt
abominable to Man, as the higheſt violations of the Laws of
Nature and Reaſon, are the things which he will put them upon,
where there are no reſtraints in his way: He drave the Heathens
(as <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies <hi>Rom. 1.)</hi> to affections ſo <hi>vile</hi> and loathſom, that
in their way of ſinning, they ſeemed to act rather like <hi>Brutes</hi> than
<hi>Men,</hi> their Minds becoming ſo <hi>injudicious,</hi> that they loſt all ſenſe
of what was fit and comely. Neither (3.) doth this ſatisfie
his cruelty that the worſt of Abominations be practiſed, but he
urgeth them to the <hi>higheſt deſperateneſs</hi> in the manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
and ſo draws them out to the <hi>front</hi> of the Battel, that
they might contemn and <hi>out-dare God</hi> to his face; he will have
them ſin with an <hi>high hand,</hi> and in the higheſt <hi>bravado</hi> of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ruſh into Sin, as <hi>the Horſe into the Battel.</hi> This cruelty of
Satan were yet the leſs, if he only brought them forth preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly,
in ſome <hi>one</hi> or two ſet Battels upon <hi>ſpecial</hi> occaſions:
But (4.) he would have this to be their <hi>conſtant work,</hi> the task
of every day; upon the ſame <hi>ſcore</hi> that <hi>Achitophel</hi> adviſed <hi>Abſalom,</hi>
to an open and avouched defilement of his Fathers Concubines,
that ſo the <hi>breach</hi> 'twixt them and God might be <hi>fixed</hi> by a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<hi>determination;</hi> and conſequently that their hands might be
ſtrong, and their hearts hardned in rebellion againſt God. And
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49412:32"/>
(5.) That Satan might not come ſhort of the utmoſt of what
Cruelty could do: We may yet further obſerve, that though
Sinners <hi>offer themſelves willingly</hi> enough, to conflict againſt God
in <hi>the high places of the Field,</hi> yet as not ſatisfied with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs,
he <hi>laſheth</hi> and whips them on to their work, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<hi>over-drives</hi> them in their own earneſtneſs. <hi>Haman</hi> was ſo
hurried and overborn with violent hatred againſt <hi>Mordecai</hi> and
the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eſther 5. 13.</note> that his own advancement, and the marks of ſingular
favour from the King availed him not, as to any <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> and
preſent contentment. <hi>Ahab,</hi> though King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
urged in his deſires for <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, that he cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his Face and grew ſick upon it. Thus, as <hi>Gally-Slaves,</hi> were
they <hi>chained</hi> to their Oar, and forced to their work beyond their
own ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is alſo a cruelty ſeen in his <hi>inceſſant provokings</hi>
and force upon the <hi>Children of God,</hi> while he urgeth his loathed
Temptations upon them againſt their will. When I conſider
<hi>Paul</hi>'s out-cry in this caſe, <hi>(Rom. 7. 15, 19.) That which I do, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
not, the evil which I would not, that do I,</hi> &amp;c.) my thoughts
repreſent him to me, like thoſe Chriſtians that were tortured in
the <hi>Trough,</hi> where Water was poured by a continued Stream up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Mouths, till the <hi>Cloth</hi> that lay upon their Lips was
<hi>forced down their Throats;</hi> or like thoſe that had ſtinking <hi>Puddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water</hi>
by a Tunnel poured into their Stomacks, till they were
ready to <hi>burſt;</hi> and ſurely he apprehended himſelf to be under
very cruel dealing by Satan, when he cryed out, <hi>O wretched man
that I am! who ſhall deliver me?</hi> If we ſeriouſly conſider the
mind and endeavours of thoſe Children of God, that are <hi>ſtriving</hi>
againſt Sin, and have caſt it off as the moſt <hi>loathſom</hi> abominable
thing, when Satan urgeth them to Evil with his inceſſant Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities;
it is as if they were forced to <hi>eat their own Excrements,</hi>
or to <hi>ſwallow</hi> down again their own <hi>Vomit;</hi> for the Devil doth
but (as it were) <hi>cram</hi> theſe Temptations down their Throats
againſt their will.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If we caſt our Eye upon the <hi>Perſecutions</hi> of all Ages,
we ſhall have thence enough to charge Satan withall, in point of
Cruelty; for he, who is ſtiled a <hi>Murtherer from the beginning,</hi> ſet
them all on Foot; 'tis he that hath filled the <hi>World</hi> with Blood
and Fury, and hath in all Ages, in one place or other, made it
a very <hi>Shambles</hi> and <hi>Slaughter-houſe</hi> of Men. (1.) Can we
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49412:33"/>
reckon <hi>how often</hi> Satan hath been at this work? that is impoſſible.
His moſt <hi>publick</hi> and general attempts of this kind are noted by
<hi>Hiſtories</hi> of all Ages. The Perſecutions of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
and of the prevailing Adverſaries of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> againſt
both or either of them, are recorded for the moſt part in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
the Perſecutions of the <hi>Roman Emperours</hi> againſt Chriſtianity
are ſufficiently known, and what is yet to come who can tell?
A great Perſecution by <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was the general belief and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of thoſe that lived in <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time, and long before;
but whether this be one more, to the ten former Perſecutions
(that ſo the Parallel betwixt theſe,<note place="margin">De Civit. Dei. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

Red-Sea after his ten Plagues, might run even) be only to be
looked for, or that others are alſo to be expected, he thinks it
would be preſumption and raſhneſs to determine: But however,
his particular aſſaults of this nature cannot be numbred: how
buſie is he ſtill at this work, in all Times and Places? inſomuch,
that <hi>he that will live Godly in this World, muſt ſuffer Perſecution.</hi> But
(2.) if we withall conſider what <hi>inventions</hi> and devices of Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Torture he hath found out, and what endleſs variety of
Pains and Miſeries he hath prepared, (a Catalogue whereof,
would fill a great deal of Paper) we can do no leſs than wonder
at the mercileſs fury, and implacable rage of him that contrived
them. Satan the great <hi>Engineer,</hi> doth but give us the <hi>Picture</hi>
of <hi>his Mind</hi> in all thoſe <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of <hi>deſtruction.</hi> And when we
ſee amongſt Tyrants, ways of torturing <hi>every Member</hi> of the
Body, and Arts of <hi>multiplying deaths,</hi> that ſo thoſe that periſh by
their hands, might not have ſo much as the mercy of a <hi>ſpeedy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,</hi>
but that they might <hi>feel themſelves to die,</hi> we may reflect
it upon Satan, in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s words to <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi, Curſed be
his Anger, for it is fierce, and his Wrath, for it is cruel.</hi> (3.) But
if we conſider what <hi>Inſtruments</hi> he uſeth, and <hi>againſt whom,</hi> we
ſhall ſee cruelty in an <hi>higher exaltation:</hi> had he uſed ſome of the
<hi>Beaſts</hi> of the Earth, or ſome of his <hi>apoſtate Aſſociats,</hi> to perſecute
and afflict the innocent <hi>Lambs</hi> of Chriſt, it might have been
much excuſed, from the natural <hi>inſtinct</hi> or curſed <hi>antipathy</hi> of ſuch
Agents: or had he uſed only the <hi>vileſt</hi> of the Children of Men to
act his tragical fury, the matter had been leſs: But as not content
with common revenge, he perſecutes <hi>Men</hi> by <hi>Men,</hi> though all of
<hi>one Blood</hi> and <hi>Off-ſpring,</hi> and ſo perverts the <hi>ends</hi> of nature, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thoſe that ſhould be the <hi>comforts</hi> and ſupport of Men, to be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49412:33"/>
the greateſt <hi>terrour</hi> and curſe to them; a thing which Nature it
ſelf abhors, and in regard of which, (that the impreſſions of Pity
might be more permanent, and efficacious) God forbad <hi>Iſrael
to ſeeth a Kid in the Mothers Milk;</hi> nay, he hath prevailed with
ſome of <hi>good Inclinations,</hi> and <hi>rare Accompliſhments</hi> (for ſuch were
ſome of the perſecuting <hi>Emperours)</hi> to be his <hi>Deputies,</hi> for <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing</hi>
the Rack, for <hi>providing</hi> Fire and Faggot; and (which is
ſtrange) hath prevailed ſo far with them, that they have been
willing to <hi>open</hi> their Ears, to the moſt <hi>palpable</hi> Lyes, the groſſeſt
Forgeries, the moſt unreaſonable Suggeſtions that known Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
could invent; and then after all, when they were drawn out
to <hi>Butchery,</hi> and ſlaughter by multitudes, they have made ſuch
<hi>Spectacles</hi> (which might make impreſſions upon an <hi>Iron</hi> Breaſt,
or an <hi>Adamant</hi> Heart,) only <hi>advancements</hi> of their <hi>Jollity;</hi> and as
<hi>Nero</hi> upon the ſight of flaming <hi>Rome,</hi> took his Harp and made
Melody: ſo have theſe tormenting Furies fired (by the help of
combuſtible matter) multitudes of ſuch harmleſs Creatures, and
then taken the opportunity of their <hi>Light,</hi> for their <hi>night Sports.</hi>
And yet (me thinks) the Devil hath diſcovered a <hi>keener</hi> Fury,
when he hath made them rage againſt the <hi>Dead,</hi> and dig their
Graves, and revenge themſelves upon their <hi>ſenſleſs Aſhes,</hi> and when
they could do no more, ſeek to pleaſe themſelves by executing
their rage againſt their Pictures or Statutes; which Actions, though
they might be condemned for <hi>Follies,</hi> yet are they evidences of
<hi>higheſt Fury,</hi> which commonly deſtroys the <hi>Judgment,</hi> and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
<hi>Wit, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> upon the <hi>Altar</hi> of Revenge.
That the Devil ſhould ſo <hi>poyſon</hi> Mans Nature, that he ſhould thus
riſe up againſt his Fellow, that carries the ſame <hi>ſpecifick</hi> Being
with himſelf, ſhews enough of his temper againſt Man, but never
more than when he prevails againſt the engagements of <hi>Kindneſs,
Bloud, Affinity,</hi> and <hi>Relation,</hi> to raiſe a Mans Enemies <hi>out of his
own Houſe, the Father againſt the Son, and the Son againſt the Father;
the Daughter againſt the Mother, and the Mother againſt the Daughter:</hi>
for this is little leſs, than an <hi>unnatural Mutiny</hi> of the Members
againſt the Body.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, We have yet a more viſible inſtance of his Cruelty, in
his <hi>bloody</hi> and tyrannical <hi>Superſtitions.</hi> Look but into the Rites

their harſh uſages in tedious Faſtings, ſtinking Drenches,
hard lyings upon Stones, eating Earth, ſtrict forbearances of

Bodies by terrible Lancings and Cuttings, for the effuſion of Blood;
their diſmembring themſelves, plucking out their Eyes, mangling
their Fleſh, to caſt in the Idols Face, ſacrificing their own Blood,

may we expect for the poor barbarous Nations of the World,
where he had all poſſible advantages for the exerciſe of his bloody
Tyranny? many ſad inſtances of this kind are collected by <hi>Purchas</hi>
in his Pilgrimage, in his Diſcourſes of <hi>Virginia, Peru, Braſilia,
Mexico, Florida,</hi> and other places, whoſe Stories of this Subject
are ſo terrible, and occur ſo frequently, that they are almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all belief; all which for brevities ſake I omit, contenting my
ſelf to note one inſtance or two out of the Scripture, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 27.
The King of <hi>Moab took his eldeſt Son that ſhould have reigned in his
ſtead, and offered him for a Burnt-offering upon the Wall:</hi> this he did
(according to the cuſtoms of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and others,) being
reduced to great ſtraits, as ſuppoſing by this means (as his laſt
refuge) to turn away the wrath of his God. Of <hi>Ahaz</hi> 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
2 <hi>Chron. 28. 3. That he burnt his Children in the Fire, after
the abominations of the Heathen.</hi> That this was not a <hi>Luſtration,</hi> or

a real ſacrificing,<note place="margin">

thus, He offered his Son as an <hi>Holocauſt.</hi> But whatever <hi>Ahaz</hi> did,
'tis certain the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſo; <hi>They offered their Sons and
Daughters to Devils, Pſal.</hi> 106. 37. And if the <hi>ſacrifices of the dead</hi>
which they eat in the Wilderneſs (mentioned <hi>verſ. 28.)</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of the Feaſts which were made at the <hi>burning of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
as ſome think,<note place="margin">Lightfoot <hi>on</hi> Acts 7. 43.</note> (though many underſtand it of their <hi>ſenſleſs
dead Gods,</hi> or their <hi>deceaſed Heroes,</hi> or for their <hi>deceaſed Friends,)</hi>
then this cruelty had ſoon poſſeſſed them: However, poſſeſs them
it did,<note place="margin">Godwin <hi>Moſes and Aaron.</hi> l. 4. c. 2.</note> as appears alſo by the deſcription of their devouring <hi>Moloch,</hi>
which the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins</hi> ſay, was an hollow brazen Image in
the form a Man, (ſaving that it had the head of a Calf,) the
Arms ſtretched in a poſture of receiving, the Image was heated
with fire, and the Prieſt put the Child in his Arms, where it was
burnt to death; in the mean time, a noiſe was made with Drums,
that the crys of the Child might not be heard, and hence was it
called <hi>Tophet,</hi> from <hi>Toph,</hi> which ſignifies a Drum; ſo that the
name and ſhape of the Image ſhews that it was uſed to theſe exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
Cruelties.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Scripture evidences, (if we were backward to credit
what Hiſtories ſay of this matter) may aſſure us of the temper
and diſpoſition of Satan, and may enable us to believe what bloody
work he hath made in the World, which I ſhall briefly ſum up in
theſe particulars.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:49412:35"/>
Firſt, Theſe <hi>inhumane,</hi> or rather (as <hi>Purchas</hi> calls them) <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane</hi>
Sacrifices, were practiſed in <hi>moſt</hi> Nations, not only the
<hi>Indians, Parthians, Mexicans,</hi> &amp;c. but <hi>Aethiopians, Syrians, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,
Grecians, Romans, Germans, French</hi> and <hi>Britanes</hi> uſed
them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Theſe Cruelties were acted not only upon <hi>Slaves</hi> and
Captives, but upon <hi>Children,</hi> whoſe age and innocency might
have commanded the compaſſions of their Parents for better
uſage.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Theſe Sacrificings were uſed upon <hi>ſeveral</hi> occaſions,
as at the <hi>ſprouting</hi> of their Corn, at the <hi>Inauguration, Coronation,</hi>
and <hi>Deaths</hi> of their Kings and Noblemen, in time of <hi>War, Dearth,
Peſtilence,</hi> or any <hi>danger;</hi> in a word (as the Prieſts in <hi>Florida</hi>
and <hi>Mexico</hi> uſed to ſay) when ever the Devil is <hi>hungry</hi> or <hi>thirſty,</hi>
that is, as oft as he hath a mind.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In ſome places the Devil brought them to <hi>ſet-times</hi>
for thoſe Offerings, ſome were <hi>Monthly,</hi> ſome <hi>Annual.</hi> The <hi>Latines</hi>
ſacrificed the <hi>tenth</hi> Child; the <hi>annual</hi> drowning of a Boy and a
Girl in the Lake of <hi>Mexico;</hi> the caſting of two <hi>yearly</hi> from the
<hi>Pons Milvius,</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Tyber,</hi> are but petty inſtances in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, We cannot paſs by the <hi>vaſt number</hi> of Men offered up
at <hi>one</hi> time; ſo thirſty is Satan of Humane blood, that from <hi>one</hi>
or <hi>two,</hi> he hath raiſed the number incredibly high; in ſome Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<hi>five,</hi> in ſome <hi>ten,</hi> in ſome a <hi>hundred,</hi> in ſome a <hi>thouſand</hi> have
been offered up. It was the argument which <hi>Montezuma</hi> the laſt
<hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Mexico</hi> uſed to <hi>Cortez</hi> to prove his ſtrength and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
by, that he ſacrificed yearly <hi>twenty thouſand</hi> men, and ſome
years <hi>fifty thouſand.</hi> Some have reſerved their <hi>Captives</hi> for that end,
others have made <hi>War</hi> only to furniſh themſelves with Men for
ſuch occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, There are alſo ſeveral <hi>circumſtances</hi> of theſe Diabolical
out-rages that may give a further diſcovery of his cruelty, as that
theſe miſerable Creatures thus led to be butchered, have been
<hi>loaden</hi> with all the Curſings, Revilings, and contumacious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
as a neceſſary concomitant of their violent deaths.
Thus were thoſe uſed, who were forced to be the publick <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
or expiation, for the removal of common Calamities.
Death alſo was not enough, except it had been moſt <hi>tormenting</hi> in
the manner of it, as of thoſe that ſuffered by the embracements
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49412:35"/>
of <hi>Moloch,</hi> the <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>feaſtings</hi> of ſuch Sacrificings (which were
in themſelves Spectacles of mourning and ſorrow) were <hi>Cruelties
to the Dead,</hi> and a <hi>barbarous enforcement</hi> againſt the <hi>Laws</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the Living. But the daſhing of the <hi>ſmoaking</hi> Heart in the
<hi>Idols face,</hi> and the pulling off the <hi>Skins</hi> from the maſſacred bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that Men and Women might <hi>dance</hi> in them, were yet more
cruel Ceremonies. And laſtly, In thoſe that have been prepared
for thoſe Solemnities, by <hi>delicious Fare, gorgeous Ornaments,</hi> and
the <hi>higheſt Reverence</hi> or Honours, (as was the manner of ſeveral
Countries) yet was this no other than Satan's <hi>inſulting</hi> over
their Miſeries, of which we can ſay no otherwiſe, than that his
<hi>tendereſt Mercies are Cruelties.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seventhly, I may caſt in to the account, that in ſome places
Satan (by a ſtrange madneſs of devotion) hath perſwaded ſome
to be <hi>Volunteers</hi> in ſuffering theſe Tortures and Deaths. Some have
caſt themſelves under the Chariot-Wheels of their Idols,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Purchas</hi> Pilgr. Part. 1. lib. 5. cap. 11.</note> and ſo
have been cruſhed to pieces. Some <hi>ſacrifice themſelves</hi> to their
Gods, firſt they cut off ſeveral pieces of their Fleſh, crying every
time, <hi>For the worſhip of my God, I cut this my fleſh;</hi> and at laſt ſay,
<hi>Now do I yield my ſelf to death in the behalf of my God,</hi> and ſo kills
himſelf out-right.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, It is wonderful to think that the Devil ſhould (by
ſtrange <hi>pretexts of Reaſon)</hi> have <hi>ſmoothed</hi> over theſe barbarous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanities,
ſo that they have become <hi>plauſible</hi> things in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of thoſe miſerable Wretches. In Piacular Sacrifices, they
believed,<note place="margin">Pro vita homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num niſi vita hominis redda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, non poſſe deorum numen placari, arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trantur. <hi>Jean D'Eſpan.</hi> Popular Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. cap. 19.</note> that except the <hi>life</hi> of a Man were given for the <hi>life</hi> of
Men, that the Gods could not be pacified. In other Sacrifices
both Euchariſtical and for Atonement, they retained this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
that <hi>thoſe things are to be offered to the Gods, that are moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and acceptable to us; and that the offering of a Calf or a Pigeon,
was not ſutable to ſuch an end.</hi> This Maxim they further improved
by the addition of another of the ſame kind, <hi>that if it were fit to
offer an Humane Sacrifice, it muſt alſo be innocent, and conſequently
little Children are the fitteſt for ſuch a purpoſe.</hi> And ſome have alſo
conjectured, that the Devil hath not been a wanting to <hi>improve</hi>
the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſacrificing his Son,<note place="margin">

of Reverence and Love</hi> which Children have to Parents, and Friends
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49412:36"/>
to Friends, as in <hi>Dragoian,</hi> when any are ſick, they ſend to their
Oracle to know whether the Parties ſhall live or die; if it be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
they ſhall die,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Purchas</hi> Pilg. Part 1. l. 5. c. 16.</note> then their Friends ſtrangle them, and eat
them; and all this from a kind of Religious reſpect to their Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
to preſerve (as they imagine) their Fleſh from putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and their Souls from torment. The like they do at <hi>Java<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>major,</hi>
when their Friends grow old and cannot work, only they
eat not their own Friends,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Purchas</hi> ibid.</note> but carry them to the Market and ſell
them to thoſe that do eat them.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Let us call to mind <hi>how long</hi> the Devil domineer'd in
the World at this rate of cruelty. When the World grew to a
freer uſe of Reaſon, and greater exerciſe of Civility, they found
out ways of mitigation, and changed theſe barbarous Rites, into
more tolerable Sacrifices; as in <hi>Laodicea,</hi> they ſubſtituted an <hi>Hart</hi>
to be ſacrificed inſtead of a <hi>Virgin;</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> an <hi>Ox</hi> was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a <hi>Man;</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Waxen-Images</hi> inſtead of <hi>Men;</hi> Images
of <hi>Straw</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> were caſt into <hi>Tyber</hi> in the place of living Men;
and the terrible burnings of <hi>Moloch,</hi> (which was not peculiar
only to the Nations near to <hi>Canaan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Diod. Siculus.</hi> Bibli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

like Brazen-Images were alſo found in <hi>Lodovicus Vives</hi> his time
by the <hi>French,</hi> in an <hi>Iſland</hi> called by them <hi>Carolina.)</hi> Theſe were
at laſt changed into a <hi>Februation,</hi> and inſtead of burning their
Children, they only paſſed them betwixt two Fires; but it was
long before it came to this. In the time of <hi>Socrates,</hi> Humane Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
were in uſe at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and they continued in the <hi>Roman</hi>
Provinces till the time of <hi>Tertullian, Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Lactantius:</hi>
Though they had been ſeveraly forbidden by <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> and
afterward by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who was forced to crucify ſome of the Prieſts
that dared to offer ſuch Sacrifices, to affright them from thoſe
barbarous Cuſtoms. In other places of the World, how long
ſuch things continued, who can tell, eſpecially ſeeing they were
found at <hi>Carolina</hi> not ſo very long ſince?</p>
                     <p>How impoſſible is it to caſt up the <hi>total Sum</hi> of ſo many large
<hi>Items?</hi> when theſe terrible cuſtoms have had ſo <hi>general</hi> a practice
in <hi>moſt</hi> Nations, upon ſo <hi>many</hi> occaſions, upon ſuch ſeeming <hi>plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Principles,</hi> when ſuch <hi>great</hi> numbers have been deſtroyed at
<hi>once,</hi> and theſe uſages have been <hi>ſo long</hi> practiſed in the World,
and with ſuch <hi>difficulty</hi> reſtrained, what vaſt multitudes of Men
muſt we imagine have been conſumed by Satans execrable cruelty?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:49412:36"/>
Sixthly, There remains one inſtance more of the Devils Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which is yet different from the former, which I may call his
<hi>Perſonal Cruelties,</hi> becauſe they are acted by his own <hi>immediate
Hand</hi> upon certain of his Vaſſals, without the help or interpoſure
of Men, who (in moſt of the forementioned caſes) have been
as Inſtruments acted by him. Here I might take notice of his
fury to thoſe that are <hi>poſſeſſed,</hi> ſome have been as it were <hi>racked</hi>
and tortured in their Bodies, and their Limbs and Members ſo
diſtorted, that it hath been not only matter of <hi>Pity</hi> to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
to ſee them ſo abuſed, but alſo of <hi>Admiration,</hi> to conſider
how ſuch abuſes ſhould be conſiſtent with their lives, and that
ſuch rendings and tearings have not quite ſeparated the Soul
from the Body. In the <hi>Goſpels</hi> we read of ſome ſuch <hi>caſt into the
Fire,</hi> and <hi>into the Water.</hi> Others, converſing <hi>with Tombs</hi> and
<hi>Sepulchers</hi> in the <hi>cold</hi> nights without <hi>Cloaths,</hi> and all of them ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of as Creatures ſadly tormented, and <hi>miſerably vexed.</hi> The
Hiſtories of later days tell us of ſome, that vomited <hi>crooked Pins,
pieces of Leather, Coals, Cloth,</hi> and ſuch like. Of others <hi>ſnatched</hi>
out of their Houſes, and tired even to fainting, and waſte of their
Spirits, as <hi>Domina Roſſa,</hi> (mentioned by <hi>Bodin,)</hi> with a great
many more to this ſame purpoſe. We may take a view of his
dealing with <hi>Witches,</hi> who (though he ſeem to gratify them in
their Tranſportations from place to place, and in their Feaſtings
with Muſick and Dancings,) are but cruelly handled by him very
often; the very Work they are put upon (which is the deſtruction
of Children, Men, Women, Cattle, and the Fruits of the Earth,)
is but a <hi>baſe Imployment;</hi> but the account he takes of them, of the
full performance of their Enterprizes, and the cruel Beatings they
have of him, when they cannot accompliſh any of their Revenges,
is no leſs than a <hi>ſevere</hi> Cruelty: He gives them no reſt, unleſs
they be doing Hurt; and when they cannot do it to the Perſons
deſigned, they are forced to do the ſame Miſchief to their <hi>own</hi>
Children, or Relations, that they may gratifie their Tyrannical
Maſter.<note place="margin">Pag. 180.</note> 
                        <hi>Bodin</hi> relates the Story of a <hi>French Baron,</hi> (who was
afterward put to death for Witchcraft) that after he had killed
<hi>eight</hi> Children, was at laſt upon a deſign of ſacrificing his <hi>own
Child</hi> to the Devil: and if at any time they grew <hi>weary</hi> of ſo exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
a Slavery, or confeſs their Wickeneſs, they are ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
tormented, that they chuſe rather <hi>to die than live:</hi> And what elſe
but Cruelty can theſe Slaves expect from him, when the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:49412:37"/>
of their Entrance into that curſed Service, betokens nothing
elſe; for their Bonds and Obligations are uſually writ, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
with their <hi>own Blood;</hi> and ſome Magical Books have been
writ with the <hi>blood</hi> of many Children, beſides the farewel that
they have of him at their uſual Meetings, is commonly this thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Threatning, <hi>Avenge your ſelves, or you ſhall die.</hi> All theſe
particulars are collected from the Confeſſions of Witches, by
<hi>Bodin, Wierus,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>But leaving theſe, Let us further enquire into Satan's Carriage
toward thoſe, that in <hi>America,</hi> and other dark and barbarous
Places know no other God, and give their devouteſt worſhip to
him. To thoſe he is not ſo kind as might be expected, but his
conſtant way is, to <hi>terrifie</hi> and <hi>torment</hi> them; inſomuch, that
ſome know no other reaſon of their worſhip, but that he may <hi>not
hurt them:</hi> And ſince the <hi>Engliſh-Colonies</hi> went into theſe Parts,
theſe <hi>Americans</hi> have learned to make this diſtinction between the
<hi>Engliſhman</hi>'s God and theirs, that theirs is an <hi>evil God,</hi> and the
other a <hi>good God;</hi>

about the Being of Spirits and Devils handled. The Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees
Opinion diſcovered. The Reality of Spirits
proved.</head>
                     <p>THe laſt particular obſerved in the Text, is his Diligence.
This adds force and ſtrength to his Malice, Power, and
Cruelty, and ſhews they are not idle, dead, or <hi>unactive Principles</hi>
in him, which (if they could be ſo ſuppoſed) would render
him leſs hurtful and formidable. This I ſhall diſpatch in a few
Inſtances, nothing to this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, His <hi>Pains</hi> he takes in <hi>hunting</hi> his Prey, and purſuing his
Deſigns: 'Tis nothing for him to <hi>compaſs Sea and Land,</hi> to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to the utmoſt in his Imployment; 'tis all his Buſineſs to
tempt and deſtroy, and his whole heart is in it. Hence Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
or Ceſſation cannot be expected, he <hi>faints</hi> not by his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and his labour with the ſucceſs of it, is all the delight we
can ſuppoſe him to have: ſo that being puſhed and hurried by the
Helliſh Satisfactions of <hi>deadly Revenge,</hi> and having a <hi>ſtrengh</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to thoſe <hi>violent Impulſes,</hi> we muſt ſuppoſe him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
(with a kind of pleaſing willingneſs) all imaginable <hi>Toyl</hi> and
<hi>Labour.</hi> If we look into our ſelves we find it true, to our no
ſmall trouble and hazard: Doth he at any time <hi>eaſily</hi> deſiſt, when
we give him a Repulſe? Doth he not come <hi>again and again,</hi>
with often and impudently repeated Importunities? Doth he not
carry a Deſign in his Mind for <hi>Months</hi> and <hi>Years</hi> againſt us? and
when the Motion is not <hi>feaſible,</hi> yet he <hi>forgets</hi> it not, but after a
long Interruption begins again where he left: Which ſhews that
he is big with his Projects, and <hi>his Mind hath no reſt:</hi> He ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out his Nets all the day long: We may ſay of him, that he
<hi>riſeth up early, and ſitteth up late</hi> at his work, and is content to
labour in the <hi>very Fire,</hi> ſo that he might but either <hi>diſturb</hi> a Child
of God, or <hi>gain</hi> a Proſilyte.</p>

Secondly, Diligence is not only diſcovered in Laboriouſneſs,
but alſo in a <hi>peculiar readineſs</hi> to eſpy, and to cloſe in with fit occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
which may in probability anſwer the End we drive at.
In this is Satan admirably diligent, no occaſion ſhall ſlip, or
through inadvertency eſcape him: No ſooner are opportunities
<hi>before us,</hi> but we may perceive him <hi>ſuggeſting</hi> to us, <hi>Do this, ſatisfie
that Luſt, take that Gain, pleaſe your ſelves with that Revenge.</hi> No
ſooner obtains he a Commiſſion againſt a Child of God, but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he is upon his Back, as he dealt with <hi>Job,</hi> he loſt no time, but
goes out immediatly from the preſence of the Lord and fals upon
him. Beſides what he doth upon <hi>ſolemn</hi> and extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
theſe that are common and ordinary, are ſo carefully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by him that every thing we <hi>hear</hi> or <hi>ſee</hi> is ready to become
our <hi>ſnare,</hi> and Satan will aſſay to tempt us by them, though they
lye ſomething <hi>out of the way</hi> of our Inclination, and be not ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to prevail with us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, 'Tis alſo a Diſcovery of his Diligence, that he never
fails to purſue every <hi>advantage</hi> which he gets againſt us, to the
<hi>utmoſt.</hi> If the occaſion, and motion thereupon encline us, ſo
that if we are perſwaded by them, he follows it on, and is not
ſatisfied, with either a <hi>lower degree</hi> of acting ſinfully, or with <hi>one</hi>
or <hi>two</hi> acts; but then he preſſeth upon us to <hi>ſin to the height,</hi> with
the greater contempt of God, and grievance of his Spirit, the
greater ſcandal and offence to our Brethren, and having once
cauſed us to <hi>begin,</hi> he would never have us to make <hi>an end.</hi> His
Temptations roll themſelves upon us, like the <hi>breaking in of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
which by the fierceneſs of their current, make a <hi>large way</hi> for
more to follow. He knows how to improve his <hi>Victories,</hi> and
will not thorow Slothfulneſs, or Pity, neglect to compleat them.
Hence it is, that ſometimes he reaps a <hi>large Harveſt</hi> where he had
<hi>ſowen little,</hi> and from <hi>one</hi> Temptation, not only wounds the ſoul
of him that <hi>committed</hi> it, but endeavours to diffuſe the Venom and
Poyſonous Steam of it to the <hi>Infection of others,</hi> to the diſgrace of
Religion, the hardning the Hearts of wicked Men, and the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ignorant out of the way of Truth. In like manner, if
he perceive the Spirits of Men grow diſtempered and wounded,
he then plyes them with Threatnings, fills them with all manner
of Diſcouragements, dreſſeth every Truth with the worſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that it may be apprehended otherwiſe than it is, and puts
ſuch Interpretations on all Providences, that every thing may
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49412:39"/>
augment the ſmart of the Wound till they be overwhelmed with
Terrors.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The <hi>various ways</hi> which he takes, ſhews alſo his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence;
if one Plot take not, he is immediately upon another;
he confines not himſelf to <hi>one</hi> Deſign, nor to <hi>one</hi> Method; but if
he find one Temptation doth not reliſh, he prepares another more
<hi>fietable;</hi> if <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> doth not pleaſe us, then he urgeth to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs;</hi>
if <hi>Terrors</hi> do not affright us to diſpair, then he abuſeth
<hi>Mercies</hi> to make us careleſs and preſuming. If we are not content
to be <hi>openly</hi> Wicked, then he endeavours to make us <hi>ſecretly</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical,
or Formal; ſometime he urgeth Men to be <hi>Prophane,</hi>
if that hit not, then to be <hi>Erronious;</hi> if he cannot work by one
Tool, then he takes another, and if any thing in his way diſguſt,
he will not urge it over-hard, but ſtraight takes another courſe;
ſuch is his Diligence, that we may ſay of him (as it was ſaid of
<hi>Paul</hi> upon a better ground) he will <hi>become all things to all Men,
that he may gain ſome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Diligence will moſt ſhew it ſelf when things are at
the <hi>greateſt hazard,</hi> or when the <hi>hopes</hi> of ſucceſs are <hi>ready to bring
forth.</hi> In this point of diligence our Adverſary is not wanting,
if Men are upon the <hi>point</hi> of Errour or Sin, how induſtriouſly
doth he labour to bring them <hi>wholly</hi> over, and to ſettle them in
Evil? one would think at ſuch times he laid aſide all other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and only attended this: How frequent, inceſſant, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
are his Perſwaſions and Arguings with ſuch? the like dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
he ſheweth in obſtructing, diſturbing, and diſcouraging us,
when we are upon our greateſt Services, or near our greateſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
what part of the day are we more wandring and vain in our
thoughts, (if we take not great care) than when we ſet about
Prayer? at other times we find ſome more eaſe and freedom in
our Imaginations, as if we could better rule or command them;
but then (as if our thoughts were only confuſion and diſorder)
we are not able to maſter them, and to keep the door of the heart
ſo cloſe, but that theſe troubleſome unwelcome gueſts will be
crouding in, is impoſſible: Let us obſerve it ſeriouſly, and we
ſhall find that our thoughts are not the ſame, and after the ſame
manner impetuous at other times as they are, when we ſet about
holy things, which ariſeth not only from the <hi>quickneſs</hi> of our
<hi>Spiritual Senſe</hi> in our readier obſervation of them at that time, but
alſo from the Devils <hi>buſie Moleſtation,</hi> and ſpecial diligence againſt us
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49412:40"/>
on ſuch occaſions. Beſides, when he foreſees our Advantages or
Mercies, he beſtirs himſelf to prevent or hinder us of them; if
Miniſters ſet themſelves to ſtudy and preach Truths that are more
<hi>piercing, weighty</hi> or <hi>neceſſary,</hi> they may obſerve more <hi>moleſtations,
interruptions,</hi> or <hi>diſcouragements</hi> of all ſorts, than when they leſs
concern themſelves with the buſineſs of the ſouls of Men. He
foreſees what <hi>Sermons</hi> are provided, and often doth he upon ſuch
foreſight endeavour to turn off <hi>thoſe</hi> from hearing, that have <hi>moſt
need,</hi> and are moſt likely to receive benefit by them. Many have
noted it, that thoſe <hi>Sermons</hi> and Occaſions that have done them
moſt good, (when they came to them) they have been ſome
way or other moſt <hi>diſſwaded from,</hi> and <hi>reſolved</hi> againſt before they
came; and then when they have broken through their ſtrongeſt
hindrances, they have found that all their obſtruction was Satans
<hi>diligent foreſight,</hi> to hinder them of ſuch a Bleſſing as they have
(beyond hope) met withal. The like might be obſerved of the
conſtant <hi>returns</hi> of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> if Men watch not againſt it,
they may meet with more than ordinary, either <hi>Avocations</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and hinder them, or <hi>Diſturbances</hi> to annoy and trouble, or
<hi>bodily Indiſpoſitions</hi> to incapacitate and unfit them: And 'tis not
to be contemned, that ſome have obſerved themſelves more apt
to be <hi>Drouſie,</hi> Dull or Sleepy <hi>on that day.</hi> Others have noted
greater <hi>bodily Indiſpoſitions</hi> then ordinarily, than at other times;
all which make no unlikely conjecture of the Devils ſpecial dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
againſt us on ſuch occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Let's caſt in another inſtance to theſe, and that is, Of thoſe that
are upon the <hi>point of Converſion,</hi> ready to forſake Sin for Chriſt.
Oh! what pains then doth the Devil take to keep them back?
He viſits them every Moment with one hindrance or other; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they are tempted to <hi>former Pleaſures,</hi> ſometime affrighted
with <hi>preſent Fears</hi> and <hi>future Diſappointments;</hi> ſometimes diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
with <hi>Reproaches,</hi> Scorns and Afflictions that may attend
their alteration; otherwile <hi>obſtructed</hi> by the perſwaſion or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>Friends</hi> and old Acquaintances; but this they are ſure of,
that they have never <hi>more Temptations,</hi> and thoſe more <hi>ſenſibly</hi>
troubling than at that time; a clear evidence that Satan is as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
as Malicious. I ſhould now go on to diſplay the Subtilty
of this Powerful, Malicious, Cruel and diligent Adverſary.
There is but one thing in the way, which hitherto I have taken
for granted, and that is, <hi>Whether indeed there be any ſuch things as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49412:40"/>
Devils and wicked Spirits, or that theſe are but Theological Engines
contrived by Perſons that carry a good will to Morality, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace, to keep Men under an awful fear of ſuch Miſcarriages, as
may render them otherwiſe a Shame to themſelves, and a Trouble to
others.</hi> It muſt be acknowledged a tranſgreſſion of the rules of
<hi>Method</hi> to offer a proof of that now, which (if at all) ought to
have been proved in the <hi>beginning</hi> of the Diſcourſe: And indeed
the queſtion at this length, whether there be a Devil, hath ſuch
affinity with that other (though for the <hi>matter</hi> they are as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
as <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell) whether there be a God,</hi> that as it well
deſerves a confirmation, (for the uſe that may be made of it to
evidence that there is a God, becauſe we feel there is a Devil,) ſo
would it require a ſerious endeavour to perform it ſubſtantially.
But it would be not only a needleſs labour, to <hi>levy an Army</hi> againſt
profeſſed <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> who with high ſcorn and deriſion roundly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
both God and Devils; ſeeing others have frequently done that,
but alſo it would occaſion too large a digreſſion from our preſent
deſign. I ſhall therefore only ſpeak a few things to thoſe that
<hi>own a God,</hi> and yet deny <hi>ſuch a Devil</hi> as we have deſcribed, and
yet not to all of theſe neither; for there were many Heathens who
were confident Aſſertors of a Deity, that nevertheleſs denied the
Being of Spirits, as <hi>ſevered from Corporeity;</hi> and others were ſo
far from the acknowledgment of <hi>Devils,</hi> that they confounded
them in the <hi>number of their Gods;</hi> others there were, who gave
ſuch credit to the frequent relations of Apparitions, and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
of that kind, that many had atteſted and complained of,
that they expreſſed more Ingenuity than <hi>Lucian,</hi> (who pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
refuſed to believe, becauſe he never ſaw them,) and yet
though they believed ſomething of reality, in that that was the
affrightment and trouble of others, they nevertheleſs aſcribed ſuch
extraordinary things to <hi>Natural Cauſes:</hi> Some to the powers of
the <hi>Heavens</hi> and Stars in their Influences upon Natural Bodies,<note place="margin">The Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note>

Leaving theſe Men as not capable of Information from Scripture
evidence, becauſe diſowning it: Let us enquire what miſtaken
apprehenſions there have been in this Matter, among thoſe that
have pretended a reverence to, and belief of Scripture: The <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees</hi>
deſerve the firſt place, becauſe they are by name noted in
Scripture to have <hi>denied the Reſurrection,</hi> and to have <hi>affirmed that
there is neither Angel nor Spirit,</hi> Acts 23. 8. Matth. 22. 23.</p>
                     <p>This opinion of theirs (could we certainly find it out) would
make much for the confirmation of the Truth in queſtion, ſeeing
(what ever it was) it is <hi>poſitively condemned</hi> in Scripture, and the
contrary aſſerted to be true. Many (and that upon conſiderable
grounds) do think, that they do not deny abſolutely that there
were any <hi>Angels at all,</hi> but that acknowledging that ſomething
there was which was <hi>called</hi> an <hi>Angel,</hi> yet they imagining it to be
<hi>far otherwiſe</hi> than what it is indeed, were accuſed juſtly for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a <hi>kind of Angels</hi> as the Scripture had every where aſſerted
and deſcribed: For conſidering that they owned <hi>a God,</hi> and (at
leaſt) the <hi>five Books of Moſes,</hi> if not all the other Books of the
Old Teſtament,<note place="margin">Vid <hi>Spanhem.</hi> dub. Evang. Part 3. dub. 29.</note> (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> and others judge, not without great
probability, for neither doth the Scripture, nor <hi>Joſephus,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
any ſuch thing of the Prophets) it is unimaginable that they
would altogether deny that there was <hi>Angel or Spirit</hi> at all. They
read of <hi>Angels</hi> appearing to <hi>Lot,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and met with it ſo
frequently, that believing <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be <hi>true,</hi> they could not
believe <hi>Angels</hi> to be an <hi>abſolute fiction,</hi> for <hi>one Fable</hi> or Falſity in
Scripture (which ſo highly aſſerts it ſelf to be an <hi>unerring Oracle</hi>
of the true God) muſt of neceſſity have <hi>deſtroyed</hi> the credit of all,
and rendred them as juſtly ſuſpected to be true in <hi>nothing,</hi> when
apparently falſe or fabulous in <hi>any thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, If we call to mind what <hi>Apprehenſions</hi> they had of <hi>God,</hi>
(which all conſent they did acknowledge) we might more eaſily
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49412:41"/>
imagine what apprehenſions they had of <hi>Angels,</hi> for in regard
that <hi>Moſes</hi> made mention of <hi>Gods Face</hi> and <hi>Back-parts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 33.</note> and that
frequently <hi>Hands</hi> and other <hi>parts</hi> of Mans Body were attributed
to him, they concluded God to be <hi>Corporeal;</hi> and ſeeing the <hi>beſt</hi> of
Creatures which God created cannot be ſuppoſed to have a more
<hi>noble Being</hi> than was that of their <hi>Creator,</hi> and at the utmoſt, to be
made according to the <hi>Pattern</hi> of his own <hi>Image</hi> and likeneſs,
they might upon this Bottom eaſily fix a denial of <hi>Incorporeal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
and by conſequence, that the <hi>Soul of Man</hi> was <hi>mortal,</hi> and
therefore that there could be no <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> ſo that the nature of
<hi>Angels</hi> being deſcribed under the notion of <hi>Spiritual Subſtances,</hi>
they are judged to deny any ſuch thing, ſuppoſing that to be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal,</hi>
was as much as <hi>not to be at all;</hi> and yet it were unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to deny, that they had not ſome <hi>Interpretation</hi> for thoſe
paſſages of Scripture that mentioned <hi>Angels,</hi> which in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
might be ſome <hi>Salvo</hi> to the truth of thoſe Hiſtorical
Writings, which they acknowledged, but what that was, we are
next to conjecture:<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de Bello Jud. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and acted the <hi>Poſſeſſed</hi> accordingly; as he frequently takes the
<hi>advantage</hi> of a <hi>Melancholly Indiſpoſition,</hi> and works great Terrors
and Affrightments by it, as in <hi>Saul,</hi> or at leaſt that, where he
poſſeſſed, he <hi>counterfeited</hi> the fits and furies of thoſe <hi>Natural</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
and acted, ſome like <hi>mad Men,</hi> and others he made
<hi>Dumb and Deaf,</hi> (which ſeems to have been the caſe of thoſe in
<hi>Matth.</hi> 9. and 12. where the <hi>deafneſs and dumbneſs</hi> did <hi>depend</hi> upon
the <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> and was <hi>cured</hi> with it:) others were made to <hi>fall

                     </p>
                     <p>As to that reaſon which ſome fetch from <hi>Dreams,</hi> 'tis rather
a <hi>Dream</hi> than a <hi>Reaſon</hi> againſt the Being of Devils, ſeeing the
<hi>Effects</hi> of theſe Infernal Spirits are <hi>far otherwiſe,</hi> than the utmoſt
of what can be imagined to be acted upon the <hi>Stage of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
ſo that the <hi>real</hi> and <hi>permanent</hi> Being of Devils may be
eaſily proved:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, From thoſe <hi>real Acts</hi> noted to be done by Angels and
Devils. The <hi>Angels</hi> that appeared to <hi>Lot,</hi> were <hi>ſeen</hi> and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Family, <hi>ſeen</hi> and obſerved by the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> Thoſe
that appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> were more than fancied Appearances,
in that they <hi>eat and drank</hi> with him. The Devil <hi>conveyed</hi> Chriſt
from place to place, this could not be a fancy or Imagination:
their begging leave to go <hi>into the Swine,</hi> ſhews them real Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtences.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, From the <hi>real Effects</hi> done by them. We have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Teſtimonies of Men really <hi>hurt</hi> and tormented by Satan.
Of ſome <hi>really ſnatch'd</hi> away, and carried a great diſtance from
their Dwellings. Of others <hi>poſſeſſed,</hi> in whom the Devil <hi>really
ſpeaks audible Voices,</hi> and <hi>ſtrange Languages,</hi> gives notice of <hi>things
paſt,</hi> and ſometime of <hi>things to come.</hi> The <hi>Oracles</hi> of the Heathen,
(which however they were for the moſt part falſe or deluſory,
yet) in that they were <hi>reſponſes</hi> from <hi>Images</hi> and Idols, were more
than <hi>Phantaſms.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:49412:43"/>
Thirdly, From what the <hi>Scripture ſpeaks</hi> every-where of them.
Of their <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Cruelty.</hi> That Devils are <hi>Murtherers</hi> from
the beginning. Their <hi>daily waiting</hi> how they may devour. Their
<hi>Arts, Wiles</hi> and <hi>Stratagems.</hi> Their <hi>Names</hi> and Appellations,
when ſtiled <hi>Principalities, Powers, Spiritual Wickedneſſes. The
Prince of the Power of the Air,</hi> and a great many more to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
ſhew that without apparent folly and dotage, we cannot
interpret theſe of <hi>Motions</hi> only upon the minds and fancies of Men:
Beſides, the Scripture ſpeaks of the <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>good Angels,</hi> as their
<hi>ſtanding continually before the Throne,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 10.</note> their <hi>beholding the face of God,</hi>
their <hi>accompanying Chriſt at his ſecond coming,</hi> their <hi>gathering the Elect
from the four Winds,</hi> &amp;c. which cannot be underſtood of any
thing elſe, but real and permanent beings; and this is alſo an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that Devils are, ſeeing the Scripture mentions their <hi>fall,</hi>
and their <hi>puniſhment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Seeing alſo the Scripture condemned the Opinion of
the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> the <hi>contrary</hi> of that Opinion muſt be true; and
expreſsly in <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 9. That which was done by an <hi>Angel,</hi> is
oppoſed to what might be <hi>Viſional or Imaginary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The reality of Devils, and their Malignity hath been
the opinion of <hi>Heathens.</hi> For there is nothing more common

                     <p>Firſt, All the Malice, Power, Cruelty, and Diligence of which
we have ſpoken, with all the advantages of Multitude, Order and
Knowledge, by which theſe cruel Qualifications are heightned.
Theſe are but his <hi>Furniture</hi> and Accompliſhment which fit him for
his ſubtile Contrivances of Deluſion, and make him able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
neither hath he any <hi>uſe</hi> of his Power and Knowledge but
in reference to <hi>Deceit,</hi> in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 11, 12. (which is a place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Apoſtle doth of purpoſe preſent Satan in his way of dealing
with Men) his whoſe practice is ſet forth under the term and
notion of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Wiles; that you may be able to ſtand againſt the

which the furniture of that Spiritual Armour is requiſite; and

things in him, which are to be provided againſt by other

to be looked upon as <hi>diſtinct,</hi> though indeed to be conſidered in
<hi>conjunction</hi> with his Subtilty and Cunning, as things that make his
Wiles the more dangerous and hazardous; <hi>For we wreſtle not
againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Principalities, againſt Powers,
againſt the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World, againſt Spiritual
Wickedneſs in high places;</hi> which words do but ſtrengthen the
Apoſtles Warning and Caution about the forementioned Wiles,
which are therefore the more carefully to be obſerved and watched
againſt, becauſe his <hi>Power</hi> is ſo great that he can <hi>contrive</hi> Snares
with the greateſt <hi>Skill</hi> and Art imaginable; and his <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> is
ſo great, that we cannot expect either <hi>Honeſty</hi> or <hi>Modeſty</hi> ſhould

make <hi>Original</hi> Sin <hi>indiſtinct</hi> from the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Soul)
is but to call it an <hi>Act.</hi> Deceitfulneſs cannot be properly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to it, but with reference <hi>to him</hi> who <hi>orders that Act</hi> in a
way of Deceitfulneſs and Deluſion, which ultimately will bring it
to Satans door: if here the deceitfulneſs of Sin be devolved upon
the Subject, then it runs into the ſame ſenſe with <hi>Jer. 17. 9. The
Heart is deceitful above all things:</hi> But why is the deceitfulneſs
fixed upon the Heart? The ground of that we have in the next
words, it is deceitful, becauſe it is wicked, <hi>deſperately wicked.</hi> But
who then inflames and ſtirs up the Heart to this Wickedneſs? Is
it not Satan? Who then is the proper Author of Deceit but he?
'Tis true indeed, that our Hearts are proper Fountains of Sin,
(and ſo may be accuſed poſſibly in ſome caſes where Satan cannot
be juſtly blamed;) yet if we conſider Deceitfulneſs as a <hi>Companion</hi>
of every Sin, though our <hi>Hearts</hi> be to be blamed for the Sin, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
will be found guilty of the <hi>deceitfulneſs.</hi> It may be ſaid a Man
complyes with thoſe things which are intended for his deluſion,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49412:44"/>
and ſo <hi>improperly</hi> by his negligence may fall under blame of <hi>ſelf-deception,</hi>
but 'tis unimaginable that he can <hi>properly</hi> and formally
intend to <hi>deceive himſelf.</hi> Deceit then not being from Sin, nor our
ſelves properly, can find out no other Parent for it ſelf than Satan.
Beſides this, that theſe Texts, upon a rational Enquiry do charge
Satan with the deceitfulneſs of Sin: they do over and above
point at the known and conſtant way of Satan, working ſo <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly</hi>
by Deluſion, that Deceitfulneſs is a cloſe <hi>Companion</hi> of <hi>every</hi>
Sin. The <hi>deceitfulneſs of Sin,</hi> is as much as <hi>the deceitfulneſs of every
ſin.</hi> Nay further, that Text of <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. ſhews this Deceitfulneſs
not to be an ordinary Sleight, but the greateſt of all Deceits
<hi>above meaſure,</hi> and of an unſearchable depth or Myſtery, <hi>who can
know it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, All <hi>Acts</hi> of Sin (ſome way or other) come thorow
Satans <hi>Fingers.</hi> I do not ſay that all Sin is Satan's proper off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,
for we have a curſed ſtock of our own; and it may be
ſaid of us, (as elſewhere of Satan,) ſometime we ſin out of our
<hi>own</hi> Inclination and Diſpoſition; yet in every Sin, whether it
ariſe from us, or the World, Satan blows the ſparks, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
all. As <hi>David</hi> ſaid to the Woman of <hi>Tekoah,</hi> Is not the hand
of <hi>Joab</hi> with thee in all this? So may we ſay, is not the hand of
Satan with thee in every Sin thou committeſt? This is ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
true, that the Scripture <hi>indifferently</hi> aſcribes the Sin ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>to us,</hi> ſometimes <hi>to the Devil.</hi> It was <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſin to tempt

whatſoever <hi>Diligence</hi> can practiſe, or <hi>Cruelty</hi> execute, all that
muſt be imagined to be in Satan.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, All this might be futher proved by <hi>Inſtances:</hi> What
Temptation can be named wherein Satan hath not acted as a
Serpent? who can imagine the cunning that Satan uſed with
<hi>David</hi> in the matter of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah?</hi> How eaſily he got him to the roof
of the houſe in order to the Object to be preſented to him? How
he directs his Eye, wrought upon his Paſſions, ſuggeſted the
Thought, contrived the Conveniencies? What Art muſt there be
to bring a darkneſs into <hi>David</hi>'s mind, a forgetfulneſs of God's
Law, a fearleſneſs of his diſpleaſure, and a neglect of his own
danger; ſurely it was no ſmall matter that could blind <hi>David</hi>'s
Eye, or beſot his Heart to ſo great a Wickedneſs? But above all
Inſtances, let us take into conſideration that of <hi>Eve,</hi> in the firſt
tranſgreſſion, wherein many things may be obſerved: as firſt,
That he choſe the <hi>Serpent</hi> for his Inſtrument, wherein though
we are ignorant of the depth of his deſign, yet that he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in it of ſubtilty, in reference to what he was about to ſuggeſt,
is plain from the Text, <hi>Now the Serpent was more ſubtile then any
Beaſt of the field;</hi> it had been needleſs and impertinent to have
noted the <hi>Serpents ſubtilty</hi> as Satans Agent, if he had not choſen
it upon that ſcore, as <hi>advantageous</hi> for his purpoſe. (2.) He ſet
upon the <hi>weaker Veſſel,</hi> the Woman, and yet ſuch (as once gained,)
he knew was likely enough to prevail with the Man, which fell
out accordingly. (3.) Some think he took the advantage of her
<hi>Husbands abſence,</hi> which is probable, if we conſider that 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould not interpoſe in the diſcourſe if he had
been preſent. (4.) He took the advantage of the <hi>Object.</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
ſhe was within ſight of the Tree, <hi>She ſaw that it was good
for food, and pleaſant to the Eyes:</hi> thus he made the Object plead
for him. (5.) He falls not <hi>directly</hi> upon what he intended,
(leſt that ſhould have ſcared her off,) but fetcheth a compaſs and
enters upon the buſineſs by an enquiry of the affairs, as if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not hurt. (6.) He ſo enquires of the matter, <hi>[Hath God
ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the Garden,]</hi> as if he made a
queſtion of the reality of the Command; and his words were ſo
ordered, that they might caſt <hi>ſome doubt</hi> hereof into her mind.
(7.) He under a pretence of aſſerting God's <hi>Liberality,</hi> ſecretly
<hi>undermines</hi> the threatning, as if he had ſaid, <hi>Is it poſſible that ſo
bountiful a Creator ſhould deny the liberty of eating of any tree? to what
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49412:46"/>
purpoſe was it made, if it might not be taſted?</hi> (8.) When he
finds that by theſe Arts he had <hi>gained</hi> a little ground, and
brought her to ſome kind of <hi>queſtioning</hi> of the reality of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
(for ſhe ſeems to extenuate it, in ſaying, <hi>leſt we die,)</hi> he
grows more bold to ſpeak out his mind, and plainly to <hi>annihilate</hi>
the threatning, <hi>Ye ſhall not die;</hi> this he durſt not do, till he had
gained in her mind a <hi>wavering ſuſpition,</hi> that poſſibly God was not
in <hi>good earneſt</hi> in that prohibition. (9.) Then he begins to urge
the <hi>conveniency</hi> and excellency of the Fruit, by <hi>equivocating</hi> upon
the name of the Tree, which he tells her, could make them
<hi>knowing</hi> as Gods. (10.) He reflects upon God as prohibiting
this, out of <hi>envy</hi> and ill-will to them. (11.) In all this there is
not <hi>a word</hi> of the <hi>danger,</hi> but <hi>impunity</hi> and advantage promiſed.
(12.) This deadly advice he covers with a pretence of <hi>greater
kindneſs</hi> and care than God had for them. See in this, as in a
clear Glaſs, Satan's way of Policy; after this rate he proceeds
in all his Temptations.</p>
                     <p>If any enquire, why ſo mighty and potent a Prince uſeth rather
the <hi>Fox's Skin</hi> than the <hi>Lyon's Paw,</hi> theſe reaſons may ſatify.</p>

he can overcome: He cannot winnow <hi>Peter</hi> before he ſue out a
Commiſſion, nor deceive <hi>Ahab</hi> till he get a Licenſe; neither can he
prevail againſt us without our own conſent. The Scripture indeed
uſeth ſome words that ſignify a <hi>force</hi> in tempting, as, <hi>that he put
it into the heart of</hi> Judas, <hi>filled the heart of</hi> Annanias, <hi>provoked</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,

                        <hi>rules in the hearts of the Children of diſobedience, and leads them

no more than this, that he uſeth <hi>forcible Importunities,</hi> frames
<hi>ſtrong Deluſions,</hi> and joyns ſometime his <hi>Power</hi> to his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
as ſometime Fowlers ſhew themſelves to the Birds they
intend to enſnare, that ſo they may be affrighted into an awe and
amazement to give a better opportunity to ſpread their Nets over
them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If he could compel, yet his way of craft and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
is generally the moſt <hi>prevalent</hi> and ſucceſsful. Force ſtirs up an
oppoſition, it uſually alarms to caution and avoidance, and frights
to an utter averſneſs in any deſign; ſo that where Force ſhould
gain its <hi>thouſands,</hi> Subtilty will gain its <hi>ten thouſands.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:49412:47"/>
Thirdly, His Strength is not <hi>uſeleſs</hi> to him: For beſides, that
it enables him to deceive with higher advantage than otherwiſe
he could do, (as hath been ſaid,) he hath times and occaſions
to ſhew his Strength and Cruelty, when his cunning hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
ſo far as to give him poſſeſſion. What was ſaid of <hi>Pope
Boniface,</hi> that he <hi>entred</hi> like a <hi>Fox,</hi> and <hi>ruled</hi> like a <hi>Lion,</hi> may be
applyed to him, he inſinuates himſelf by ſubtilty as a <hi>Fox</hi> or
Serpent, and then rules with rigour as a <hi>Lion.</hi>

                     <p>OUr next buſineſs is to enquire after theſe ways of Deceit in

<hi>Sin,</hi> his Deceits againſt <hi>Duty,</hi> his cunning in promoting <hi>Error,</hi>

more ſpecial.</p>
                     <p>As an Introduction to the firſt, I ſhall ſpeak a word of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in the general. This in its general notion, is a <hi>Tryal</hi> or
<hi>Experiment made of a thing:</hi> the word that ſignifies to tempt,
comes from a word that ſignifies to <hi>pierce,</hi>

                           </gap>.</note> or bore thorow, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a Tryal as goes to the <hi>very heart,</hi> and inwards of a thing.
In this ſenſe 'tis attributed to God, who is ſaid to have <hi>tempted
Abraham,</hi> and to put our <hi>Faith</hi> upon <hi>tryal;</hi> and ſometime to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49412:47"/>
                        <hi>Satan</hi> who is ſaid to have tempted Chriſt, though he could not

                           <hi>Calv.</hi> Inſtit. l. 3. c. 20. § 46.</note> But though God and Satan do make theſe
<hi>tryals,</hi> yet is there a vaſt difference betwixt them, and that not
only in their <hi>Intentions,</hi> (the one deſigning only a <hi>diſcovery</hi> to
Men of what is in them, and that for moſt <hi>holy ends,</hi> the other
intending <hi>ruine</hi> and deſtruction;) but alſo in the <hi>way</hi> of their
Proceedings. God by providence <hi>preſents</hi> Objects and Occaſions;
Satan doth not only do that, but farther <hi>inclineth</hi> and <hi>poſitively</hi>
perſwadeth to evil. Hence is it, that Temptations are diſtinguiſhed

Diabolus tentat, Deus probat,</hi> the Devil tempts, God only trys.
We ſpeak of Temptation as 'tis from Satan, and ſo 'tis deſcribed,

which we may obſerve, that in every ſuch Temptation there is
the <hi>Object</hi> to which the Temptation tends, the <hi>endeavour</hi> of Satan
to <hi>encline</hi> our hearts and draw on our conſent, and the <hi>Inſtrument</hi>

Satan owns this as his <hi>buſineſs</hi> and imployment in his anſwer to
God, <hi>I come from going to and fro in the Earth, from walking up and
down in it.</hi> This cannot be properly ſaid of him who is a <hi>Spirit;</hi>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49412:48"/>
ſuch a going to and fro, as that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 4. which is plainly
there expreſſed to be for the encreaſe of Knowledg.</p>
                     <p>The matter of his enquiry, or particulars of his ſtudy, are ſuch
as theſe: (1.) Man's <hi>State,</hi> he conſiders and gueſſeth whether a
Man be Regenerate or Unregenerate. (2.) The <hi>Degree</hi> of his
State; if Unregenerate, how near or far off he is the Kingdom of
God; if Regenerate, he takes the compaſs of his Knowledge, of
his Gifts, of his Graces. (3.) He enquires into his <hi>Conſtitution</hi>
and Temper, he obſerves what Diſpoſition he is off. (4.) His
<hi>Place,</hi> Calling and Relation, his Trade, Employment, Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Riches or Wants. (5.) His <hi>Sex.</hi> (6.) His <hi>Age,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The way by which he knows theſe things is plain and eaſie,
moſt of theſe things are open to <hi>common</hi> obſervation; and what is
<hi>intricate</hi> or dark, that he beats out, either by <hi>comparing</hi> us with
our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and conſidering a <hi>long tract</hi> of actions and carriage; or
by <hi>comparing</hi> us with <hi>others,</hi> whoſe ways he had formerly noted
and obſerved.</p>
                     <p>The end of this ſearch is to give him <hi>light</hi> and inſtruction in
point of advantage; hence he knows where to raiſe his Batteries,
and how to level his Shot againſt us. This Chriſt plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
to be the deſign of all his ſtudy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 30. where he
tells his Diſciples, he expected yet another onſet from Satan, and
that near at hand, <hi>for the Prince of the World</hi> was then upon his
motion, he was a <hi>coming;</hi> but withall, he tells them of his ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
againſt his aſſaults, in that there was <hi>nothing in Chriſt</hi> of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in any of theſe forementioned ways to foot a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon. It appears then that he looks for ſuch advantages,
and that without theſe he hath little expectancy of prevailing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Satan's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond general Rule.</note> Satan having acquainted himſelf with our condition,
makes it his next care to provide <hi>ſutable</hi> Temptations, and to
ſtrike in the right Vein; for he loves to have his work eaſie and
feaſible; he loves not go againſt the Stream. Thus he conſidered
<hi>Judas</hi> as a <hi>covetous</hi> Perſon, and accordingly provided a Temptation
of gain for him. He did the like with <hi>Achan;</hi> and hence was it,
that he had the <hi>Sabeans</hi> ſo ready for the plunder of <hi>Job;</hi> he had
obſerved them a People given to rapine and ſpoil; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<hi>Job</hi>'s Goods being propounded to them as a good and
eaſie Booty, he ſtraightway prevailed with them. It was eaſie
for him to draw <hi>Abſolom</hi> into an open Rebellion againſt his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49412:48"/>
Father, he had taken notice of his <hi>ambitious</hi> and aſpiring Humor,
and of the <hi>grudges</hi> and diſſatisfactions under which he laboured;
ſo that providing him a fit opportunity, he engaged him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly,
according to this rule, where he obſerves Men of <hi>ſhallow
Heads</hi> and low Parts, he the more freely impoſeth upon them in
things palpably <hi>abſurd;</hi> where he takes notice of a <hi>fearful</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
there he tempts them with <hi>Terrours</hi> and affrightful Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions;
he hath Temptations proper for the <hi>Sanguine complexion,</hi>
and for the <hi>Melancholy;</hi> he hath his methods of dealing with the
<hi>Luſtful</hi> and Wanton; with the <hi>Paſſionate</hi> and Revengeful; he hath
<hi>Novelties</hi> at hand for the <hi>itching Ear,</hi> and Suggeſtions proper for
thoſe that are <hi>Atheiſtically</hi> inclined.</p>
                     <p>To this may be objected,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> That experience tells us, Satan doth
not always walk in this Road, nor confine himſelf to this Rule;
ſometime he tempts to things which are <hi>croſs</hi> to our <hi>Tempers</hi> and
Inclinations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true he doth ſo;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but yet the general Rule is not prejudiced
by this exception, eſpecially if we conſider,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That Satan being ſtill under the commands and <hi>reſtraint</hi>
of the Almighty, he cannot always tempt <hi>what he would,</hi> but
according to a ſuperiour order and command. Of this nature I
ſuppoſe was that Temptation, of which <hi>Paul</hi> complained ſo
much, <hi>he kept down his Body,</hi> upon this very deſign, that he might
have it <hi>in ſubjection,</hi> and yet is he <hi>buffeted</hi> with a Temptation,
which expected an advantage uſually from the <hi>temper</hi> and frames of
our Bodies; (for ſo much I ſuppoſe, that Phraſe, <hi>a Thorn in the
Fleſh</hi> will unavoidably imply, (though it ſtill leave us at uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties)
what the Temptation was in particular.) Here Satan
tempts at a diſadvantage and contrary to this Rule; but then we
muſt know, that he was not the <hi>Maſter</hi> of his <hi>own Game;</hi> God
expreſsly ordering ſuch a Temptation as was <hi>diſagreeing</hi> with the
<hi>Apoſtles diſpoſition,</hi> that it might the <hi>leſs prevail</hi> or hazard him, and
yet be more available to keep him <hi>low, leſt he ſhould be exalted
above meaſure,</hi> which was God's deſign in the matter.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Sometimes our Temper <hi>alters:</hi> as the tempers of our
Bodies in a Sickneſs may in a fit be ſo changed, that they may
deſire at that time what they could not endure at another. A ſpecial
occaſion or concurrence of circumſtances may alter for the time
our Conſtitution, and ſo an <hi>unuſual</hi> Temptation may at that
time <hi>agree</hi> with this deſign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49412:49"/>
Thirdly, Sometime by <hi>one Temptation</hi> Satan intends but to lay
the <hi>foundation</hi> of another, and then of purpoſe he begins with a
<hi>ſtrange ſuggeſtion,</hi> either to keep us at the <hi>gaze</hi> while he covertly
doth ſomething elſe againſt us, or to move us to a <hi>contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream</hi>
by an over-haſty raſhneſs.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Sometime he tempts when his <hi>main</hi> deſign is only
to <hi>trouble</hi> and diſquiet us, and in ſuch caſes the moſt <hi>unnatural</hi>
Temptations backed with a violent <hi>impetuouſneſs</hi> do his work
the beſt.</p>
                     <p>Satan's next work is the <hi>propoſal</hi> of the Temptation:<note place="margin">Satan's third general Rule.</note> In the
two former he provided Materials and laid the Trains, in this
he gives Fire, by propounding his deſign; and this alſo he doth
with caution, theſe ſeveral ways.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He makes the <hi>Object</hi> ſpeak for him, and in many he is
ſcarce put to any further trouble; the Object before them ſpeaks
Satan's mind, and gains their conſent immediatly, yet is there no
ſmall cunning uſed in fitting the Object and Occaſion, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things about to anſwer the very <hi>nick</hi> of time which he takes
to be advantageous for him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Sometime he appoints a <hi>Proxy</hi> to ſpeak for him;
not that he is <hi>ſhame-faced</hi> in Temptation, and not always at <hi>lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
for his own work, but this way he <hi>inſinuates</hi> himſelf the more
dangerouſly into our Affections, and with leſs ſuſpicion uſing
our <hi>Friends,</hi> Relations or intimate Acquaintance to interceed for
a wicked deſign. He did not ſpeak himſelf to <hi>Eve,</hi> but choſe a
<hi>Serpent;</hi> he thought <hi>Eve</hi> would ſooner prevail upon <hi>Adam</hi> than
the Serpent could. He tempted <hi>Job</hi> by the tongue of his Wife,
as if he had hoped, that what ſo near a Relation had counſelled,
would eaſily be hearkened to. He tempted <hi>Chriſt</hi> to avoid ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by <hi>Peter,</hi> under a pretence of higheſt love and care, <hi>Maſter,
ſpare thy ſelf;</hi> yet our Saviour forbears not to note Satan's Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
cloſely twiſted with <hi>Peter</hi>'s kindneſs. At this rate are we
often tempted where we little ſuſpect danger.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If he finds the two firſt ways unhopeful or unſutable,
then he <hi>injects the motion,</hi> and ſo plainly ſpeaks to us <hi>inwardly</hi>
himſelf, <hi>Do this act, take this advantage for pleaſure or profit,</hi> &amp;c.
He thought it not enough to tempt <hi>Judas</hi> by the <hi>object</hi> of Gain,
but he brake his mind in direct terms, and <hi>put it into his heart,</hi>
Joh. 13. 2. He did the like to <hi>Ananias,</hi> whoſe heart he <hi>filled</hi> with
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49412:49"/>
a large motion for that lye, and backed it with many conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the neceſſity and expediency of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3. There is
no queſtion to be made of this;<note place="margin">Child of Light. <hi>p.</hi> 45.</note> Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> gives clear proofs
of it, and ſo do ſeveral others. When we conſider, that thoughts
are ſometime caſt upon the minds of Men which are <hi>above their
knowledg,</hi> and that they ſay and do things ſometime which are
far beyond any of their Accompliſhments and Parts, and yet in
the nature of it wicked, we muſt be forced to run ſo high as to
charge it upon Satan.<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Pool Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopſ.</hi> in loc.</note> 
                        <hi>Saul</hi>'s propheſying, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 10. was
by the influence of the evil Spirit; and this (as <hi>Junius, Tirinus,</hi>
and others interpret) muſt of neceſſity be underſtood of ſuch a
kind of action and ſpeaking, as the true Prophets of the Lord
uſually expreſſed under the Influences of the bleſſed Spirit; for
from the <hi>likeneſs</hi> of the action in both, muſt the name be borrowed.
The experience that we have of <hi>inward Diſputings,</hi> the bandying
of Arguments and Anſwers in ſeveral Caſes, is a proof of this
beyond exception. Wounded Conſciences expreſs an admirable
<hi>dexterity</hi> in breaking all Arguments urged for their peace and
eſtabliſhment; as alſo in <hi>framing</hi> Objections againſt themſelves,
ſo far above the uſual meaſure of common Capacities, that we
cannot aſcribe it to any other than Satan's private aid this way.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The motion being made (if there be need) he
doth <hi>irritate</hi> and ſtir up the mind to the embracement of it: and
this he doth <hi>two</hi> ways,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By an <hi>earneſtneſs of Sollicitation;</hi> when he urgeth the thing
over and over, and gives no reſt; when he joyns with this, an
importunity of begging and intreating with the repeated motion;
when he draws together and advantageouſly doth order a <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
of conſiderations to that end; and when in all this he doth
<hi>hold down</hi> the mind and thoughts, and keep them upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of the Object, Motions, and Reaſons. Thus he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
<hi>David,</hi> 1 Chron. 21. 1. And this kind of dealing occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Apoſtle to name his Temptations, and our reſiſtance, by
the name of <hi>wreſtlings,</hi> in which uſually there appears many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
and often repeated, to throw down the Antagoniſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He doth irritate by a <hi>ſecret power</hi> and force that he
hath upon our Fancies and Paſſions. When Men are ſaid to be
<hi>carried</hi> and <hi>led</hi> by Satan,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> Child of Light.</note> it implyes (in the judgment of ſome)
more than <hi>importunity;</hi> and that though he cannot <hi>force</hi> the <hi>ſpring</hi>
of the Will, yet he may conſiderably act upon it, by pulling at
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49412:50"/>
the <hi>Weights</hi> and Plummets, that is, by moving and acting our
Imaginations and Affections.</p>
                     <p>The motion being thus made,<note place="margin">Satan's fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule.</note> notwithſtanding all his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
often finds reſiſtance: in which caſe he comes to the
practice of a <hi>fourth</hi> Rule, which is to <hi>draw</hi> away and entice the
heart to <hi>conſent;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Manton</hi> in loc.</note> as 'tis expreſſed, <hi>Jam. 1. 14. Everyman is tempted,
when he is drawn away and enticed.</hi> I ſhall avoid here the variety
of the apprehenſions which ſome declare at large about the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the words, ſatisfying my ſelf with this, that the Apoſtle
points at thoſe <hi>Artifices</hi> of Satan by which he <hi>draws</hi> and allures the
will of Man to a complyance with his motions; which when he ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in any degree, then may a Man be ſaid to be prevailed upon
by the Temptation. But then here is the wonder how he ſhould
ſo far prevail againſt that Reaſon and Knowledg which God hath
placed in Man, to fence and guard him againſt a thing ſo abſurd
and unreaſonable as every ſin is? The Solution of this knot we
have in 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 4. The God of this World blinds the eyes of Men,</hi>
draws a curtain over this Knowledg, and raiſeth a darkneſs upon
them: which darkneſs though we cannot fully apprehend, yet
that it is a very great and ſtrange darkneſs may be diſcovered;
(1.) Partly by conſidering the <hi>ſubject</hi> of it, Man, a <hi>rational</hi>
Creature, in whom God hath placed a <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is both
a <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Witneſs,</hi> and <hi>Judge.</hi> It cannot be ſuppoſed an eaſie
matter to cloud or obliterate that Law, to ſilence or pervert that
Witneſs, or to corrupt that Judge; but it will riſe higher in the
wonder of it, if we conſider this in a <hi>godly Man,</hi> one that <hi>ſets
God before him,</hi> and is wont to have his fear in his heart; ſuch a
man as <hi>David</hi> was, that in ſo <hi>plain</hi> a caſe, in ſo <hi>high</hi> a manner,
ſo <hi>long</hi> a time, with ſo <hi>little</hi> ſenſe and apprehenſion of the evil
and danger, Satan ſhould ſo <hi>quickly</hi> prevail, 'tis an aſtoniſhment:
neither will it be leſs ſtrange if we conſider (2.) The <hi>iſſue</hi> and
effect of this blindneſs: Some <hi>riſe up</hi> againſt this Law of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
arguing it falſe and erronious, and making concluſions
directly contrary, as <hi>Deut. 29. 19. I ſhall have peace, though I walk
on in the imaginations of my heart. I have fellowſhip with him, though I
walk in darkneſs,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 6. <hi>We will not hearken unto thee, but will
certainly do whatſoever thing goeth out of our own mouth,</hi> Jer. 45. 16, 17.
in which caſes, the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or principles of Conſcience are
quite overthrown. Some are <hi>hardned,</hi> and as to any <hi>application</hi> of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49412:50"/>
their acts to this Rule, quite dead and ſenſleſs; though they riſe
not up againſt the light, yet are they <hi>willingly ignorant,</hi> without
any conſideration of what they are doing; here the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or
witneſſing and excuſing power of Conſcience is idle and aſleep.
Some though they know the Law, and in ſome meaſure ſee their
actions are ſinful, yet they paſs <hi>no judgment,</hi> apprehend no danger;
<hi>No man ſmites upon his thigh, ſaying, what have I done?</hi> Jer. 8. 6.
Nay, ſome are ſo far from this, that they preſumptuouſly juſtify
themſelves, though they ſee their own blame and ruine before
them, <hi>I do well to be angry, and that to the death,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jonah,</hi>
when Satan had ſpread a darkneſs upon him.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall we ſay of theſe things? here is darkneſs <hi>to be
felt, Egyptian</hi> darkneſs: to explain the way of it fully is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for us, to do it in any tollerable way is difficult. To make
ſome diſcovery herein I ſhall, (1.) Shew that the Devil doth
entice to ſin, by <hi>ſtirring up our luſt.</hi> (2.) That by the <hi>power</hi> and

whole attempt and ſtriving of corrupt Nature againſt the Spirit,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note>
being ſet forth by this expreſſion, <hi>of luſting againſt the Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Satan takes advantage of our own luſts, and ſo plows
with <hi>our Heifer,</hi> turning our own Weapons againſt our ſelves,
is evident by the general vote of Scripture. The Apoſtle
<hi>James</hi> 1. 14. tells us, that every Temptation prevails only by
the power and working of our <hi>own luſts:</hi> Satan is the Tempter,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49412:51"/>
but our luſts are the advantages by which he draws and enticeth;
the corrupt principle within us, is called <hi>fleſh,</hi> but the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it works, either in its <hi>own proper</hi> motion, or as <hi>ſtirred</hi> up by
the Devil, is that of <hi>luſt and affection;</hi> and therefore he that
would ſtop that iſſue, muſt look to mortify it in its <hi>affections and
luſts,</hi> Gal. 5. 24. We are further told by <hi>John, 1 Epiſt.</hi> 2. 16.
that all thoſe ſnares that are in the World, are only hazardous,
and prevailing by <hi>our Luſts.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 4.</note> More generally the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>
ſpeaks; the whole bundle of actual Sins that have ever been in
the World came in at this door, <hi>The corruption that is in the World
is through Luſt.</hi> In the ſtirring up our Luſts, Satan uſeth no ſmall
Art and Subtilty, and ordinarily he worketh by ſome of theſe
following ways.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He uſeth his skill to <hi>dreſs</hi> up an Object of Luſt that it
may be taking and alluring; he doth not content himſelf with a
<hi>ſimple propoſal</hi> of the Object, but doth as it were <hi>paint</hi> and varniſh
it, to make it ſeem beautiful and lovely; beſides al lthat wooing
and importunity which he uſeth to the Soul by private and unſeen
Suggeſtions, he hath (no doubt) a care to gather together all
poſſible concurring Circumſtances, by which the ſeeming good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or conveniency of the Object is much heightned and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.
We ſee thoſe that have <hi>skill</hi> to work upon the Humors
of Men, place a great part of it in the <hi>right circumſtantiating</hi> a
motion, and in taking the Tempers and Inclinations of Men at a
<hi>right time.</hi> And they obſerve, that the miſſing of the right ſeaſon
is the hazard of the deſign, even there where the Object and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
ordinarily are ſutable. There is much in placing a Picture
in a right poſition, to give it its proper grace and luſtre in the Eyes
of the Beholders. When a man is <hi>out of humor,</hi> he <hi>nauſeats</hi> his uſual
delights, and grows <hi>ſullen</hi> to things of frequent practice. 'Tis
likely <hi>Eve</hi> was not a Stranger to the Tree of Knowledg before
the Temptation, but when the Serpent ſuggeſts the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of
the Fruit, the Fruit it ſelf ſeems <hi>more beautiful</hi> and deſirable,
<hi>good for Food, and pleaſant to the Eyes.</hi> Though we are not able
to find out the way of Satan's beautifying an Object, that it may
affect with more piercing and powerful delights; yet he that ſhall
conſider, that not only <hi>Prudence</hi> (in an advantageous manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of things) adds an additional beauty to Objects propoſed;
but alſo that <hi>Art</hi> by placing things in a right poſture, may derive
a radiancy and beam of Beauty and Light upon them, (as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

piece of Glaſs, may be <hi>ſo</hi> poſited to the Sun beams, that
it may <hi>reflect</hi> a ſparkling light as if it were a <hi>Diamond:)</hi> He
that ſhall conſider this (I ſay) will not think it ſtrange for the
Devil to uſe ſome Arts of this kind for the adorning and ſetting
off an Object to the Eye of our Luſts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We have reaſon to ſuſpect that he may have ways
of Deceit and <hi>Impoſture</hi> upon our <hi>Senſes.</hi> The deceits of the
Senſes are ſo much noted,<note place="margin">Des Cartes.</note> that ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> will ſcarce allow
any credit to be given them;<note place="margin">Ant. le grand. Philoſoph. vet. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> not that they are always deceitful,
but that they are often ſo, and ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fore always ſuſpitious. The
Soul hath no <hi>intelligence</hi> but by the <hi>Senſes:</hi> 'tis then a buſineſs of
eaſie belief, that Satan may not altogether ſlight this advantage,
but that when he ſees it fit for his purpoſe, he may impoſe upon
us by the deception of our Eyes and Ears; we little know how
oft our Senſes have diſguiſed things to us. In a pleaſing Object,
our Eyes may be as a <hi>magnifying</hi> or <hi>multiplying</hi> Glaſs. In the firſt
Temptation Satan ſeems to have wrought both upon the Object,
and alſo upon the Senſes, <hi>She ſaw it was good for Food, and pleaſant;</hi>
who can queſtion but that ſhe ſaw the Fruit <hi>before?</hi> but this was
<hi>another kind</hi> of ſight, of more power and attraction. An inſtance
of Satan's Cunning in both the forementioned particulars, we
have from <hi>Auſtin,</hi> relating the Story of his Friend <hi>Alipius,</hi> who
by the importunity of his Acquaintance conſented to go to the
<hi>Theatre,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Spectavit, clamavit, exar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, abſtulit inde ſecum inſaniam qua ſtimularetur redire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> yet with a reſolve, <hi>not to open his Eyes,</hi> leſt the ſight of
theſe Spectacles ſhould entice his Heart; but being there, the
noiſe and ſudden ſhouting of the multitude prevailed ſo far with
him, that he forgot his reſolution; takes the <hi>liberty</hi> to ſee what
occaſioned the ſhouting, and <hi>once ſeeing,</hi> is now ſo inflamed with
delight, that he ſhouts as the reſt do, and becomes a frequenter of
the <hi>Theatre</hi> as others: What was there to be ſeen and heard he
knew before, by the relation of others; but now being preſent,
his Eyes and Ears were by Satan ſo heightned in their offices, that
thoſe bloody Objects ſeemed pleaſant, <hi>beyond</hi> all that had been
<hi>reported</hi> of them, and the luſt of his Heart drawn out by Satan's
cunning diſpoſal of the Object and Senſes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is no ſmall inticement ariſing from the <hi>fitneſs</hi>
and ſutableneſs of Occaſion. An Occaſion exactly fitted, is more
than half a Temptation; This often makes a Thief, an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where the acts of theſe Sins have their riſe from a
ſudden fit of humor, (which <hi>occaſion</hi> puts them in,) rather than
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49412:52"/>
from <hi>deſign</hi> or premeditation. Cunningly contrived Occaſions
are like the danger of a <hi>Precipice;</hi> if a Man be ſo fooliſh as to take
up a <hi>ſtand</hi> there, a ſmall <hi>puſh</hi> will throw him over, though a far
greater might not harm him if he were upon a Level. 'Tis
Satan's Cunning to draw a Man within the <hi>reach</hi> of an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
All the reſolves of <hi>Alipius</hi> were not <hi>ſafe-guard</hi> to him
when once he was brought <hi>within</hi> hearing and ſight of the
Temptation: If he had ſtaid at home, the hazard of Satan's Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
(though earneſt) had not been ſo much as the hearing
of his Ears, and ſight of his Eyes. In 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 11. Paul</hi>'s fears
of Satan's taking advantage againſt the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did manifeſtly
ariſe from the <hi>preſent poſture</hi> of their Church affairs: for if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
Perſon ſhould not be received again into the
Church, an ordinary puſh of Temptation might either have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed</hi>
or <hi>confirmed</hi> their Contentions,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Calvin</hi> in loc:</note> or precipated them into an
opinion of <hi>too much ſeverity</hi> againſt an offending Brother; and
that their preſent frame, made them more than ordinarily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to theſe Snares, is evident from the Apoſtle's caution
inſerted here in this Diſcourſe, ſo <hi>abruptly,</hi> that any Man may
obſerve the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the Matter, and the <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> of his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
did lead his Pen. The <hi>Souls</hi> of Men have their general <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſia</hi>'s,
and Diſaffections, as our Bodies have, from a lingring
diſtemperature of the Blood and Humors; in which caſe, a <hi>ſmall</hi>
occaſion (like a particular error of Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a declining Body)
will eaſily <hi>form</hi> that Inclination into particular acts of Sin.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Satan hath yet a further reach in his Enticements,
by the power which he hath upon our <hi>Fancies</hi> and Imaginations:
That he hath ſuch a power was diſcovered before. This being then
ſuppoſed, how ſerviceable it is for his end, 'tis now to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.
Our Fancy is as a <hi>Glaſs</hi> which with admirable <hi>celerity</hi>
and quickneſs of motion, can preſent before us all kinds of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
it can in a moment run from one end of the Earth to the
other; and beſides this, it hath a power of <hi>creating Objects,</hi> and
caſting them into what <hi>forms</hi> and ſhapes it pleaſeth, all which our
underſtanding cannot avoid the ſight of. Now the <hi>power</hi> of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
is acknowledged by all to be very <hi>great,</hi> not only as
working upon a <hi>Melancholy</hi> and diſtempered Spirit,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Burtons</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanch. Part 1. §. 2. p. 93. <hi>Reynolds</hi> Treat. of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. c. 4.</note> (of which
Authors give us large accounts) but alſo upon Minds <hi>more remote</hi>
from ſuch peremptory Deluſions; as may be daily obſerved in the
<hi>prejudices</hi> and <hi>prepoſſeſſions</hi> of Men, who by reaſon of the <hi>impreſſions</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:49412:52"/>
of Imagination, are not (without difficulty) drawn over to
the acknowledgment of the truth of things, and the true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of Matters; neither is the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> only liable to a
more than ordinary heat and <hi>rapture</hi> by it, but the <hi>Will</hi> is alſo
quickned and <hi>ſharpned</hi> in its deſires by this means: Hence is it
(as one of the fore-cited Authors obſerves) that Fancy doth
often more toward a Perſwaſion by its <hi>inſinuations,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reynolds</hi> ibid.</note> than a <hi>cogent
Argument,</hi> or <hi>rational Demonſtration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is no leſs a powerful Inſtrument in Satan's hand, than
commonly and <hi>frequently</hi> made uſe of; who amongſt us doth not
find and feel him dealing with us at this Weapon? When he
propounds an Object to our Luſt, he doth not uſually expoſe it
<hi>naked</hi> under the hazard of dying out for want of proſecution, but
but preſently calls in our <hi>Fancy</hi> to his aid, and there raiſeth a
<hi>Theatre,</hi> on which he <hi>acts</hi> before our Minds, the Sin in <hi>all its ways
and poſtures.</hi> If he put us upon Revenge, or upon Luſts of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,
or Covetouſneſs, or Ambition, we are ſure (if we
prevent it not) to have our Imagination preſenting theſe things
to us, as in <hi>lively Pictures</hi> and Reſemblances, by which our deſires
may be enflamed and prepared for conſent.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Sometime he ſhews his Art in preparing and fitting
<hi>our Bodies</hi> to his deſigns, or in fitting Temptations to our Bodies,
and the Inclinations thereof. The <hi>Soul</hi> though it be a noble
Being, yet is it <hi>limited</hi> by the Body, and incommodated by the
<hi>crazyneſs</hi> and indiſpoſitions thereof, ſo that it can no more act
<hi>ſtrenuouſly</hi> or evenly to its Principles in a <hi>diſordered</hi> Body, than it
can rightly manage any <hi>Member</hi> of it (in its natural motions)
where the Bones are <hi>disjointed.</hi> Hence, Sickneſs or other bodily
Weakneſſes do alter the <hi>Scene,</hi> and add another kind of <hi>byaſs</hi>
to the Soul than that it had before. This Satan takes notice
of, and either follows his advantage of the <hi>preſent Indiſpoſition,</hi> or
(if he hath ſome ſpecial deſign) endeavours to <hi>caſt</hi> our Body
into ſuch a diſorder as may beſt ſute his Intention. <hi>Aſa</hi> was
more eaſily drawn to be overſeen in peeviſhneſs and raſh anger in
his <hi>latter</hi> days, when his Body grew diſeaſed. Satan had his
advantage againſt <hi>Solomon</hi> to draw him to Idolatry when <hi>old age,</hi>
and <hi>uxoriouſneſs</hi> had made him more <hi>ductile</hi> to the ſollicitations of
his Wives; <hi>When</hi> Solomon <hi>was old, his Wives turned away his
Heart,</hi> 1 King. 11. 4. The Devil, when he took upon him to
foretel <hi>Job</hi>'s blaſpheming God to his Face, yet he attempted not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49412:53"/>
the main deſign till he thought he had throughly <hi>prepared</hi> him for
it, by the anguiſh and ſmart of a diſtempered Body and Mind;
and though he failed in the great buſineſs of his Boaſt, yet he
left us an experiment in <hi>Job,</hi> that the likelieſt way to <hi>prevail</hi>
upon the Mind in hideous and deſperate Temptations, is to
mould the Body to a <hi>ſutable</hi> frame: He prevailed not againſt <hi>Job</hi>
to cauſe him curſe God, yet he prevailed far, <hi>he curſed the day of
his birth,</hi> and ſpake many things by the force of that diſtreſs,
which he profeſſeth himſelf aſhamed of afterwards. The Body
then will be in danger (when 'tis diſordered) to give a tincture
to every action, as a diſtempered Palat communicates a bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to every thing it takes down.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Evil <hi>Company</hi> is a general preparatory to all kinds of
Temptation: He enticeth ſtrongly that way. For (1.) Evil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
doth <hi>inſenſibly dead</hi> the Heart, and quench the heat of the
Affections to the things of God; it hath a kind of bewitching
power to eat out the fear of the Lord in our hearts, and to take
off the weight and power of religious duty; it not only <hi>ſtops our
Tongues,</hi> and retards them in ſpeaking of good things, but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenceth</hi>
the very <hi>Heart,</hi> and poyſons it into a kind of deadneſs
and <hi>lethargy,</hi> ſo that our thoughts run low, and we begin to think
that ſevere watchfulneſs of Thoughts, and the guard of our
Minds to be a needleſs and <hi>melancholly Self-impoſition.</hi> (2.) Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
hath a ſtrange inſinuating force to <hi>inſtamp a Reſemblance,</hi>
and to beget Imitation. <hi>Joſeph</hi> living where his Ears were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
beaten with Oaths, finds it an eaſie thing (upon a feigned
occaſion) to ſwear by the Life of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Evil Company is
Sins <hi>Nurſery,</hi> and Satan's <hi>Academy,</hi> by which he trains up thoſe
whoſe knowledg and hopeful beginnings had made them ſhy of
his Temptations; and if he can prevail with Men to take ſuch
Companions, he will with a little labour preſently bring them to
any Iniquity.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, But his <hi>higheſt</hi> project in order to the enticing of
Men, is to engage their <hi>Affections</hi> to an height and <hi>paſſionateneſs.</hi>

                     <p>How powerful a part of his Deſign this is, will appear from

                        <hi>Fear</hi> is a deſperate hurry of the Soul; <hi>Love ſtrong as Death;
Jealouſie cruel as the Grave:</hi> each of them ſtriving which ſhould
excell in violence, ſo that 'tis a queſtion yet undertermined which
Paſſion may challenge the ſuperiority.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Their Fury is <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>unbridled,</hi> like ſo many
<hi>wild Horſes</hi> let looſe, hurrying their Rider which way they pleaſe:
They <hi>move</hi> not upon the command of Reaſon, but oft prevent
it in their <hi>ſudden riſe;</hi> neither do they take Reaſons <hi>advice</hi> for their
<hi>courſe</hi> proportionable to the occaſion, for often their <hi>humor,</hi> rather
than the <hi>matter</hi> of the provocation, gives them <hi>Spurs;</hi> and when
they have <hi>evaporated</hi> their heat, they ceaſe, not as following the
command of Reaſon, but as <hi>weakned</hi> by their own <hi>violence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They are <hi>not eaſily conquered,</hi> not only becauſe they
<hi>renew</hi> their ſtrength and onſet after a Defeat, and like ſo many
<hi>Hydra</hi>'s heads ſpring up as faſt as cut off, but they are <hi>our ſelves,</hi>
we can neither run from them, nor from the love of them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, And conſequently highly <hi>advantageous</hi> in Satan's

                     <p>THat Satan doth entice us by ſtirring up our Luſt, hath been
diſcovered; it remains that I next ſpeak to the ſecond thing
propounded which was,</p>
                     <p>That by this power of Luſt he <hi>blinds and darkens our Mind.</hi>
That the Luſts of Men are the great principle upon which Satan
proceeds in drawing on ſo great a blindneſs, (as we have ſpoken
of) I ſhall briefly evince from theſe few Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, From the <hi>unreaſonableneſs</hi> and abſurdity of ſome Actions
in Men otherwiſe ſufficiently rational. He that conſiders the acts
of <hi>Alexander</hi> in murthering <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> for no other crime than
defending the <hi>cauſe of the Gods,</hi> and affirming that <hi>Temples</hi> could
not be built to a <hi>King,</hi> without provoking a <hi>Deity;</hi> and yet this
ſo ſmoothed, (if<note n="*" place="margin">Ego autem ſeram immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitatem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor Regi.—Hominem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequitur ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando, nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam comita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Divinitas. <hi>Curt.</hi> lib. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Quintus-Curtius</hi> repreſent him right) that he
ſeemed to flatter <hi>Alexander</hi> with an opinion of <hi>Delfication</hi> after
his death: Whoſoever (I ſay) ſhall conſider this cruelty, will
condemn <hi>Alexander</hi> as blind and irrational in this matter, and
yet no other cauſe can be aſſigned hereof, but that his <hi>luſt after
Glory and Honour</hi> darkned his Reaſon. The like may be ſaid of his
killing <hi>Epheſtion</hi>'s Phyſician,<note place="margin">Iracundia—velut Tyrannus omnia ſuo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu gobernans ruptis habenis, &amp; jugo rationis excuſſo gladies inique contra omnes diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xit. <hi>Theod.</hi> Hiſt. Eccleſ. l. 5. p. 587.</note> becauſe he died. The brutal fury of that
<hi>Conſul,</hi> that made a <hi>Slave</hi> to be eaten up with <hi>Lampreys,</hi> for no
other fault than the breaking of a Glaſs, can be aſcribed to nothing
elſe but the boyling over of his Paſſion. A ſadder inſtance of
this we have in<note n="†" place="margin">Immoderata animi concita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus—facinus crudele ut ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farium commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit.</note> 
                        <hi>Theodoſius ſenior,</hi> who for an affront given to ſome
of his Officers in <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> commanded the deſtruction of the
City, and the ſlaughter of the Citizens to the number of 7000,
without any diſtinction of nocent and innocent: This blind rage
the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> notes, as the fruit of violent and unbridled Luſt in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49412:54"/>
a Man, otherwiſe juſt and gracious. Thouſands of Inſtances of
this nature might be added. But,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If we conſider the known and <hi>viſible hazards</hi> to Life
and Eſtate, and (that which is more,) to that part of them
which is <hi>Immortal;</hi> upon all which, Men do deſperately adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
upon no other ground or motive than the <hi>gratifications</hi> of their
Luſts: We may eaſily conclude that there is a ſtrange force and
power in their Paſſions to blind and beſot them; and this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
is the common practice of all Men, where Grace
(as the only <hi>Eye-ſalve)</hi> doth not reſtore the ſight. The Heathens
in all theſe practices of Filthineſs and Folly, recorded <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 29.
They had ſo far a diſcovery of the danger (if they had not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
that <hi>Truth</hi> and Light in <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> verſ. 18.) that
they knew <hi>the judgment of God, that they which commit ſuch things
are worthy of death,</hi> verſ. 32. Yet notwithſtanding, the vanity of
their Imaginations (influenced by Luſt) darkned their heart ſo
much, that they did <hi>not only do theſe things</hi> (of ſo great vileneſs
and unſpeakable hazard,) <hi>but had pleaſure in thoſe that did them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The blinding power of Luſt is yet more remarkable:
When we ſee Men <hi>glorying in their Shame,</hi> and mounting their
triumphal Chariots to expoſe themſelves a <hi>Spectacle</hi> to all, in that
<hi>garb of deformity</hi> which their Luſts have put them in. 'Tis a
blindneſs to do any act againſt the rules of Reaſon, but 'tis a far
great blindneſs for Men to pride themſelves in them. What have
the iſſues of moſt Wars been, but burnings of Cities, devaſtations
of flouriſhing Kingdoms, ſpilling the blood of Millions, beſides
all the Famine and other miſeries that follow; yet theſe actions
(that better beſeem Tigars, Lions and ſavage Bruits, than Men
of Reaſon) are honoured with the great triumphant names of
<hi>Vertue, Manhood, Courage, Magnanimity, Conqueſt,</hi> &amp;c. If the
power and humor of their Luſts of vain-glory and revenge had
not quite muffled their underſtandings, theſe things would have
been called by their <hi>proper names,</hi> of Murther, Cruelty, Robbery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and the Actors of ſuch <hi>Tragedies,</hi> inſtead of triumphal <hi>Arches</hi> and
acclamations of Praiſe, would have been buried under heaps of
Ignominy and perpetual Diſgraces, as <hi>Prodigies</hi> of Nature, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
of Men, and <hi>Haters</hi> of Mankind.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, But there is yet one Evidence more plain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing.
When our Luſts <hi>are up,</hi> though <hi>Reaſon</hi> offer its <hi>aids</hi> to
allay the Storm, yet the wiſeſt of Men (otherwiſe compoſed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49412:55"/>
and calm) are ſo far from taking the advantage of its guidance,
that oftentimes they <hi>trample</hi> upon it and deſpiſe it; and as if
Luſts (by ſome ſecret <hi>Incantation)</hi> had made them <hi>impenetrable,</hi>
they are not capable of its light and conduct, and can make no
more uſe of it, than a <hi>blind</hi> Man can do of a <hi>Candle.</hi> To this
purpoſe, let us obſerve the carriage of Diſputants; if Men do
any way publickly engage themſelves in a Conteſt of this nature,
though Truth can be but on the one ſide, yet both Parties give
Arguments, and anſwer Objections with equal confidence of
victory, and a contempt of the reaſons and ſtrength of each others
diſcourſes: and this proves ſo fatal to him that maintains the
miſtake or untruth, that not one of a thouſand hath the benefit
and advantage for the finding of Truth, which free and <hi>unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
Byſtanders</hi> may have; ſo true is that, <hi>Omne perit judicium cum
res tranſit in affectum,</hi> When Affections are engaged, Judgment is
darkned. 'Tis a thing of common obſervation, that when Men
are diſcourſed into <hi>Anger</hi> and Heat, they preſently grow <hi>abſurd;</hi>
are diſabled for ſpeaking or underſtanding Reaſon, and are oft
hurried to ſuch inconveniences and miſcarriages, that they are
<hi>aſhamed</hi> of themſelves; when they <hi>cool</hi> and the fit is over, <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
ira animum,</hi> &amp;c. To all this might be added, the power of
Luſt in Perſons <hi>voluptuous,</hi> who dedicate themſelves to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the Fleſh. Thoſe <hi>that ſerve divers Luſts and Pleaſures,</hi>
their ſlaviſh Eſtate, their baſe Drudgery, do clearly evince that
Luſt <hi>unmans</hi> them, and puts out their Eyes. <hi>Mark-Antony</hi> by
this means became a Slave to <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> never did a poor Captive
ſtrive more to obtain the good will of his Lord than he to pleaſe
this Woman, inſomuch that beſotted with his Luſt, he ſeemed to
want that <hi>common foreſight</hi> of his danger, which the ſmalleſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Reaſon might have afforded to any, and ſo dallied himſelf
into his ruine. From all theſe Conſiderations and Inſtances, it
appears our Luſts afford ſuch Vapours and Miſts, that our Reaſon
is darkned by them, or rather, they are like a <hi>Doſe of Opium</hi> that
ſtrongly ſtupifies and binds up the Senſes. But yet it remains
that the various ways by which our Luſts do blind us be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
opened, and they are five. (1.) Our Luſts blind us by <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting</hi>
the uſe and exerciſe of Reaſon. (2.) By <hi>perverting</hi> it.
(3.) By <hi>withdrawing</hi> the Mind from it. (4.) By <hi>diſturbing</hi> it in
its operation. And (5.) By a <hi>deſperate precipitancy.</hi> All which
I ſhall more fully explain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:49412:55"/>
Firſt, Our Luſts blind us by <hi>preventing</hi> and intercepting the
exerciſe of Light and Reaſon, and Satan in this caſe uſeth theſe
deceits.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He endeavours ſo to <hi>ſtir up</hi> our Luſt, as yet to <hi>conceal his
deſign. Secreſie</hi> is one of his main <hi>Engines,</hi> he doth not (in this
caſe) ſhew his Weapon before he ſtrikes; and indeed his Policy
herein is great, For (1.) By this means he takes us at <hi>unawares,</hi>
ſecure, and unprepared for reſiſtance. (2.) We are often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared
<hi>without noiſe,</hi> and before our conſideration of things can
come in to <hi>reſcue</hi> us. (3.) If he get not his whole deſign upon
us this way, yet he oft makes an <hi>half victory;</hi> by this means he
procures an half conſent, or inclination to ſin before we diſcover
that we are under a Temptation; for when the <hi>Foundation</hi> of a
Temptation is laid <hi>uneſpyed,</hi> then we awaken with the Sin <hi>in our
hand,</hi> as ſleeping Men awake ſometime with the word in their
mouths. If any queſtion, how can theſe things be? how can he
<hi>ſteal</hi> a Temptation upon us with ſuch ſecreſie? I anſwer, he can do
it theſe three ways.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He ſometimes after a <hi>careleſs manner,</hi> and as it were by
the by, <hi>drops</hi> in a Suggeſtion into our hearts, and that without
noiſe or importunity, giving it (as it were this charge,) <hi>ſtir not
up, nor awaken him;</hi> and then he ſits by to obſerve the iſſue, and
to ſee if the <hi>Tinder</hi> will take fire of it ſelf. Thus many a motion
thrown into our hearts, as it were accidently, or ever we are
aware, begets a ſudden flame.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He ſometimes <hi>fetcheth a compaſs,</hi> and makes a thing
far <hi>different</hi> to be a <hi>Preamble</hi> or Introduction to his intended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
Thus by Objects, Imployments, Diſcourſe, or Company,
that ſhew not any direct tendency to evil, doth he inſenſibly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
Pride, Paſſion or Luſt. How ſlyly and ſecretly doth he put
us upon what he intends as a further ſnare? how unawares, while
we think of no ſuch thing, are we carried ſometime upon the
borders of Sin, and into the enemies quarters? Satan in this acts
like a Fowler, who uſeth a ſtalking Horſe, as if he were upon
ſome other imployment, when yet his deſign is the deſtruction of
the Bird.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Another way of Secreſie is his raiſing a <hi>croud of other
thoughts</hi> in the Mind, and while theſe are mixed and confuſedly
floating in the Underſtanding or Fancy, then doth he thruſt in
among them the intended Suggeſtion, and then ſuffering the reſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49412:56"/>
to vaniſh, he by little and little ſingles this out as a more ſpecial
object of conſideration, ſo that we caſt a ſudden glance upon this,
and we are often taken with it before we conſider the danger.
In this Satan doth as Souldiers, who take the advantage of a Miſt
to make a nearer approach to their Enemies, and to ſurpriſe
them before diſcovery of the danger: This he doth with us while
we are in a <hi>Muſing fit,</hi> or a <hi>Melancholy dream.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A ſecond Deceit for the <hi>preventing</hi> of a ſerious conſideration, is
<hi>ſudden Surpriſal.</hi> In the former he endeavoured to <hi>conceal the
Temptation</hi> while he is at work with us, but in this he <hi>ſhews <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
Temptation plainly,</hi> only he ſets upon us without giving of us
<hi>warning</hi> of the onſet; but then he backs it with all the violent
importunity he can, and by this he hinders the recollecting of our
ſelves and the aid of Reaſon. This courſe Satan only takes with
thoſe whoſe Paſſions are apt to be <hi>very ſtirring</hi> and boyſterous;
or ſuch as being his Slaves and Vaſſals are <hi>more ſubject</hi> to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
Thus a ſudden provocation to an angry Man, gives him
not time to conſider, but carries him headlong. A <hi>ſurpriſe</hi> of
Occaſion and Opportunity, is frequently a <hi>conqueſt</hi> to thoſe that
have any <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> of Hope, Deſire, or Revenge: Surely <hi>David</hi>
was taken at this advantage in the matter of <hi>Bathſheba.</hi> And
here we may note, that good Men upon ſuch a <hi>ſudden motion,</hi> do
<hi>yield</hi> (without any blow or ſtrugling) to that, which at <hi>other
times</hi> they could not be drawn to by many <hi>reaſons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Conſideration is prevented by <hi>gradual Intanglements.</hi>
Satan ſo orders the matter that Sin creeps on upon us as Sleep,
by <hi>inſenſible degrees:</hi> For this end ſometimes he <hi>diſſembles</hi> his
Strength and ſets upon us with <hi>lower</hi> Temptations, and with leſs
force than otherwiſe he could: He knows we are not moved to
<hi>extreams,</hi> but by <hi>ſteps</hi> and <hi>habits,</hi> are not confirmed, but by <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual</hi>
proceedings; to take too great ſtrides, may <hi>ſometime</hi> prevail
at preſent, but the ſuddenneſs and greatneſs of the alteration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
a <hi>ſtrangeneſs</hi> on the Soul, may occaſion <hi>after-thoughts</hi> and
recoyling: Therefore he tempts firſt to <hi>thoughts,</hi> then to a <hi>delight</hi>
in theſe thoughts, then to the <hi>continuation</hi> of them, then to <hi>reſolve,</hi>
and ſo on to <hi>practice.</hi> And in like manner, he tempts ſome to
make bold with a <hi>ſmall matter,</hi> which ſhall ſcarce come under the
notion of wrong; then to a <hi>greater,</hi> and ſo gradually to <hi>higher</hi>
things, and thus he inſenſibly brings on a thieviſh Inclination
and Practice. For the ſame end ſometimes he ſhews his skill in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49412:56"/>
the management of Occaſions, he imperceptibly hooks Men into
Sin, by drawing them firſt to be bold with <hi>Occaſions;</hi> he tells them
they may ſit at the Ale-houſe, and yet not be drunk; that they
may keep Familiarity, and yet not be lewd; that they may look
upon a Commodity, and yet not ſteal: and when the <hi>Occaſions</hi> are
by this means made <hi>familiar</hi> to them, then he puts them on a
ſtop further, but by ſuch ſlow motions, that the progreſs is ſcarce
diſcerned till they be in the Snare.</p>

                     <p>THe ſecond way by which Satan blinds us through the power
of Luſt, is by <hi>preverting</hi> and <hi>corrupting</hi> our Reaſon, drawing

have ſuch a power upon the Underſtanding to make ſuch an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
need not ſeem ſtrange to thoſe that ſhall conſider, that
the Scripture propounding the knowledge of the higheſt Myſteries,
doth poſitively require (as a neceſſary prerequiſite to theſe things)
that we <hi>lay aſide all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs</hi> (in theſe
terms,<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 20.</note> noting the loathſom defilement of our Luſts) that ſo we
may <hi>receive the ingrafted Word;</hi> ſtrongly implying that our Luſts
have a power to <hi>elude</hi> and evade the <hi>ſtrongeſt reaſons,</hi> and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their entertainment: Which our Saviour notes, to have been
alſo the cauſe of the Jews blindneſs,<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 44.</note> 
                        <hi>How can ye believe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

                     <p>But becauſe this may ſeem to ſome almoſt impoſſible that Luſts
ſhould turn our <hi>Sun</hi> into darkneſs, I ſhall a little explain it.</p>
                     <p>The Underſtanding doth uſually, (if practice of Sin have not

of Good and Evil in matters of Temptation and Duty; yet
its power in this caſe is only <hi>directive</hi> and ſuaſive to the <hi>Will,</hi> not
<hi>abſolutely imparative;</hi> the Will muſt follow the Underſtandings
dictate, but is not under any neceſſity of following its <hi>firſt advice;</hi>
'tis the <hi>ultimum dictamen,</hi> the laſt dictate that it is engaged to
follow: However the Will (in the caſe laſt mentioned) be
dependant upon the Underſtanding, yet the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> doth
alſo <hi>quoad exercitium,</hi> depend upon the <hi>Will,</hi> and as to the <hi>act of
conſideration,</hi> is under its command; ſo that after the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hath faithfully repreſented the evil of a Sin, the Will can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it to another conſideration, and force it to <hi>new thoughts</hi> and
conſultations about it; in which caſe, the Will doth <hi>prompt</hi> the
Underſtanding, tells it what <hi>verdict</hi> it would have it to bring in,
and ſo doth really ſollicite and beg for a complyance.</p>
                     <p>The Underſtanding is <hi>ductile</hi> and capable of being <hi>brib'd,</hi> and
therefore ſuffers its <hi>right Eye</hi> to be put out by the Will, and as a

have it;</hi>

                     <p>The poſſibility of Luſts perverting our Underſtanding being
diſcovered, the way and manner how Luſt doth thus corrupt it, is
needful to be opened.</p>
                     <p>Luſt exerciſeth this power under the management of Satan,
<hi>directly</hi> and <hi>indirectly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Our Reaſon is <hi>directly</hi> perverted, when it is ſo far wrought
upon as to call that <hi>Good,</hi> which is indeed plainly and apparently
<hi>Evil.</hi> So great a corruption is not common and ordinary, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the heart of Man be <hi>eaſily</hi> drawn to go ſo paipably againſt
clear light and evidence: 'Tis therefore only in <hi>ſome Caſes,</hi> and in
<hi>ſome Perſons,</hi> either of <hi>weaker</hi> Faculties, or of extraordinarily <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched</hi>
Principles that Satan can work up Luſt to give ſo great
a darkneſs: However 'tis evident that Satan uſeth theſe deceits
in this thing.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He ſtrives (where the matter will bear it) to put the
<hi>name</hi> of <hi>Vertue</hi> or Good upon Actions and things that are not ſo.
This Temptation doth moſt appear in thoſe things that are of a
<hi>doubtful</hi> and diſputable nature, or in thoſe Actions which in their
appearance or <hi>pretenſions</hi> may ſeem to be <hi>vertuous.</hi> Whatever Sin
is capable of any Paint or Varniſh, that he takes the advantage
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49412:57"/>
of. <hi>Saul</hi>'s Sacrificing was a great iniquity, and yet the pretence
of the <hi>general Goodneſs</hi> of the action (being in it ſelf commanded)
and the ſuppoſed <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Saul</hi>'s doing it, becauſe <hi>Samuel</hi> came
not, were conſiderations upon which his Underſtanding warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him that undertaking. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Perſecution, (though a real
gratification of his envious luſtings) by his blinded Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was judged duty: What more common than for Worldly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs
and Covetouſneſs, to be called a faithful and dutiful
care for the proviſion of our Families? Lukewarmneſs is often
juſtified under the notion of Moderation and Prudence; and any
thing that can but pretend any <hi>kindred</hi> to, or reſemblance of
Good, our Luſts preſently prevail for an approbation and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Satan uſeth the advantage of <hi>Extreams,</hi> for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
of our Underſtandings. To this purpoſe he doth all he
can to make ſuch an Extream <hi>odious</hi> and diſpleaſing, that ſo we
may run upon the <hi>contrary,</hi> as matter of duty. Many there are
whoſe heads are ſo weak, that if they ſee the danger of <hi>one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream,</hi>
they never think themſelves in ſafety till they fly to a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Exceſs,</hi> and then they think the Extream they embrace needs
no other juſtification, than the apparent Evil of what they have
avoided. Satan knowing this, like the <hi>Lapwing,</hi> makes the
greateſt noiſe when he is furtheſt from his Neſt, and in much
ſeeming earneſtneſs, tempts us to ſomething that is moſt croſs to
our Temper or preſent Inclination; or endeavours to render ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo to us, not with any hopes to prevail with us there, but to
make us run as far from it as we can into another Snare, and alſo
to make us believe that we have done well and <hi>avoided</hi> a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when indeed we have but <hi>exchanged</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He directly blinds our Underſtandings in ſinful Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
by engaging us to <hi>corrupt Opinions</hi> which lead to wicked or
careleſs Courſes. Satan with great eaſe can put Men upon Sin,
when once he hath prevailed with them to receive an error, which
directly leads to it. Corrupt Principles do naturally corrupt Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
and both theſe may be obſerved to meet in thoſe deluded
ones,<note place="margin">Jude 4.</note> whom the Scripture mentions, <hi>that denyed the only Lord
God, and Jeſus Chriſt, turning alſo the grace of God into laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
falſe-Teachers that brought in <hi>damnable Hereſies,</hi> counted it
<hi>pleaſure to riot,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 1, 13, 14.</note> had <hi>eyes full of Adultery,</hi> and <hi>could not ceaſe from
Sin.</hi> With what confidence and ſecurity will Sin be practiſed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49412:58"/>
when an <hi>Opinion</hi> ſigns a <hi>Warrant,</hi> and pleads a Juſtification for
it?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In Actions, whoſe goodneſs or badneſs is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
diſcoverable by the <hi>ends</hi> upon which they are undertaken,
'tis no great difficulty for Satan, to impoſe upon Men a Belief
that they <hi>act</hi> by <hi>ends</hi> and reſpects, which do <hi>not indeed move</hi> them
at all; and in this caſe Men are ſo blinded, that they do not, or
will not know or acknowledge they do evil; the <hi>matter</hi> of the
Action being <hi>warrantable,</hi> and the <hi>end</hi> being out of the <hi>reach</hi> of
common diſcovery, they readily believe the <hi>beſt</hi> of themſelves;
and looking more at the warrantableneſs of the nature of the
act in the general, than at their grounds and intentions, they
think not that they do evil. This was a fault which Chriſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in the Diſciples when they called for <hi>fire from Heaven</hi> upon
the <hi>Samaritans:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 9. 55.</note> the thing it ſelf <hi>Elias</hi> had done before, and Chriſt
might have done it then, but they wanted the <hi>ſpirit of Elias;</hi> and
therefore Chriſt rejects their motion as unlawful <hi>in them,</hi> who
conſidered not that a Spirit of Paſſion and Revenge did altogether
influence them, and inſtead of ſhewing a juſt diſpleaſure againſt
the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> he ſhews that Satan had blinded them by their
Luſt, and that the thing they urged was ſo far from being good,
that it was apparently evil, in that they were acted by <hi>another
Spirit</hi> than they <hi>imagin'd.</hi> This way of deceit is very common.
How often may we obſerve Chriſtians pretending <hi>conſcientious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactions</hi>
about the actions of others, when the private ſpring
that animates them is ſome <hi>ſecret grudge</hi> that lyes at the bottom;
and yet becauſe the thing wherein they are diſſatisfied may truly
deſerve <hi>blame,</hi> they are not apt to <hi>condemn</hi> themſelves but think
they do well.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Luſts alſo pervert our Reaſon and Knowledg <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly:</hi>
and this is, when we are not <hi>ſo far</hi> blinded, as to believe
the thing unto which we are tempted, to be <hi>good abſolutely;</hi> yet
notwithſtanding, we are perſwaded of <hi>ſome conſiderable goodneſs</hi> in
it, and ſuch as may for the preſent be embraced. For this purpoſe
Satan hath ready theſe <hi>two</hi> Engines:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He ſets before us the <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> Profits and other <hi>delights</hi>
of Sin: Theſe he heightens with all his Art and Skill, that he
may fix in our Minds this concluſion, that however it be <hi>forbidden;</hi>
yet it would conduce much to our <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> or advantage if it
were practiſed; and here he promiſeth ſuch golden ends and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49412:58"/>
fruits of Sin, as indeed it can never lead unto, inviting us in the
words of the Harlot,<note place="margin">Prov. 7. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>I have decked my Bed with coverings of Tapeſtry,
with carved Works, with fine Linnen of Egypt. I have perfumed it
with Myrrhe, Aloes and Cinnamon. Come, let us take our fill of theſe
delights.</hi> Thus he ſet upon <hi>Eve, Taſte this Fruit, and ye ſhall be as
Gods.</hi> Thus he attempted Chriſt himſelf, <hi>All theſe will I give thee,</hi>
proffering the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of them.
The pleaſures of Sin are Satans great <hi>Bait,</hi> and theſe ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
and ſtir up our Luſts; yet becauſe the fear of the danger may
ſtick in the Heart, <hi>'Tis pleaſant, but O I dare not,</hi> ſaith the Sinner,
<hi>I fear the hazard or the evil that may fellow:</hi> Therefore Satan hath
his other Engine at hand to blind us, and to carry our Minds from
ſuch conſiderations, and that is,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, His <hi>Sophiſtical Arguments,</hi> by which the danger may
be leſſened; of theſe his Quiver is full. As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He urgeth that the Sin tempted to <hi>is little.</hi> But a <hi>little
one,</hi> 'tis not (ſaith he) ſo great a matter as you make it, there
are other Sins far greater, and theſe alſo practiſed by Men that
profeſs as much as you. Thus he would <hi>ſhame</hi> us (as it were)
out of our <hi>fear,</hi> by calling it <hi>ſeverity, nicenſs,</hi> or an unneceſſary
<hi>preciſeneſs.</hi> If this prevail not,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He hath then another Argument. Oh (ſaith he)
be it ſo, that it is a <hi>little more</hi> than ordinary, yet it is <hi>but once; taſte</hi>
or try it, you need not engage your ſelves to <hi>frequent</hi> practice;
you may retreat at pleaſure. But if the fear of the danger pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt this, then,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He labours to put us under a kind of <hi>neceſſity</hi> of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and this he pleads as a juſtification of the evil. 'Tis not
altogether right, but you cannot well avoid it. This <hi>plea</hi> of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity

from <hi>Nabal</hi>'s great ingratitude, <hi>In vain have I kept all that this
Fellow hath in the Wilderneſs, &amp;c.</hi> and as one engaged by a neceſſity
of repaying ſuch wrongs and affronts, doth he determine to cut
them off. <hi>Aaron</hi> (when he was taxed by <hi>Moſes</hi> about the golden
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49412:59"/>
Calf) excuſeth the matter by a pretended neceſſity of doing
what he did upon the violent importunity of ſuch an heady
People;<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 22.</note> and that when <hi>Moſes</hi> was not to be found, <hi>Thou kneweſt
the People, that they are ſet on miſchief.</hi> This that he urged to
<hi>Moſes,</hi> Satan no doubt had urged to him, and he had acquieſced
in it, as ſomething that he thought would excuſe, or at leaſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate
the offence. Yet if the Sinner break through this Snare,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly, He comes on with a ſofter plea of</hi> infirmity; <hi>and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to perſwade Men that they may yield under pretence of</hi>
being forced, <hi>and that their</hi> ſtrivings <hi>and</hi> reluctancies <hi>will</hi> leſſen <hi>the
evil to an apparent</hi> ſin of infirmity; <hi>and thus he beſpeaks them,</hi>
Have not Gods Children infirmities? they ſin, though with reluctancy,
and doeſt not thou reſiſt? doth not the fear that is in thy heart ſhew an
unwillingneſs; <hi>mayeſt thou not plead,</hi> the evil that I would not do,
that do I? if thou yield, will not God account it a rape upon thine
integrity? <hi>If this Arrow ſtick not,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Then he extenuates the offence, by propounding ſome
ſmaller <hi>good</hi> or convenience that may <hi>follow</hi> that evil. And this,
though it be a way of arguing, directly contrary to that rule,
<hi>Do not evil that good may come,</hi> yet it oft proves too ſucceſsful; and
'tis like that common ſtratagem of War when by the propoſal of
a <hi>ſmall booty</hi> in view, the Enemies are drawn <hi>out of their Hold</hi> into
a <hi>fore-contrived</hi> Danger. Thus Satan pleads, This <hi>one act of Sin
may put you into a capacity of honouring God the more.</hi> Some have
admitted advancements and dignities <hi>againſt Conſcience,</hi> upon no
better ground, but that they might <hi>keep out Knaves,</hi> and that they
might be in a condition to be <hi>helpful</hi> to good Men. Surely the
Devil prevailed with <hi>Lot</hi> by this Weapon, when he offered the
proſtitution of his Daughters to the luſts of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> that
the Strangers (as he thought them) might be preſerved; <hi>by this
evil</hi> (thinks he) <hi>a greater may be avoided. Herod</hi>'s Conſcience
could not at firſt conſent to the cutting off the head of <hi>John
Baptiſt,</hi> but when Satan ſuggeſts the obligation of his Oath, he
concludes, that in the killing of <hi>John</hi> he ſhould eſcape the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Oath; Thus a <hi>pretended good</hi> to come, becomes a <hi>pander</hi>
to a preſent certain iniquity. Now if after all theſe arguings the
Conſcience carrieth an apprehenſion of danger, then</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly, He plainly diſputeth the</hi> poſſibility of the eſcape of danger,
though the ſin be committed. <hi>All the inſinuations of pleaſure and
advantage by which</hi> Eve <hi>was tempted, could not</hi> at firſt <hi>blot out

her</hi> fears <hi>of the conſcquence of that trangreſſion, it did ſtick in
her mind ſtill,</hi> leſt we <hi>die; then Satan plainly denyeth the danger
ſhe feared,</hi> Ye ſhall not ſurely die, the threatning <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> it may
be was but for trial, or without a ſtrict and poſitive purpoſe in God to
execute it, there is no certainty that God was in good earneſt when he
ſpake ſo. <hi>The Devil uſually urgeth the</hi> Mercy <hi>of God, the</hi> Merits
<hi>of Chriſt, his</hi> Promiſes <hi>of Pardon, the</hi> Infirmities <hi>of the Saints,</hi>
their Sins, <hi>and</hi> Repentances, <hi>&amp;c. From all theſe drawing this
concluſion, that we may venture upon the Temptation without
any apparent hazard.</hi> 'Tis but repenting <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> and that is an
eaſie work to a gracious Soul, God is ready to be reconciled, even to a
Prodigal Son; he is not ſo cruel as to caſt away any for a ſmall matter,
he that waits to be gracious will not ly at catch for opportunities and
occaſions to deſtroy us, he that delights not in the death of a Sinner will
not delight to take ſtrict exceptions againſt every failing.</p>
                     <p>If Satan can prevail with us to <hi>extenuate</hi> the Sin, to <hi>ſlight</hi> the
hazard, or any way to leſſen it upon any of the forementioned
accounts; then having poſſeſſed us before with high <hi>apprehenſions</hi>
of delights and ſatisfactions in the Sin, he quickly perſwades to
<hi>accept</hi> the motion, as having a conveniency and advantage in it
not to be deſpiſed: and thus doth he <hi>indirectly pervert</hi> our Reaſon,
which is the ſecond way by which he blinds us, through the
working of our Luſt.</p>

with the degrees of that procedure. Of diſturbing or

blinding Men. His deceits therein. Of precipitancy,
Satan's fifth way of blinding Men. Several deceits to
bring Men to that.</head>
                     <p>THirdly, Satan blinds the Sons of Men by <hi>diverting and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
their Reaſon,</hi> and taking it off from the <hi>purſuit</hi> of
its diſcovery or apprehenſions. For ſometime it cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to go ſo contrary to its Light, as to call evil good, either
<hi>directly</hi> or <hi>indirectly:</hi> Then is Satan put to a new piece of Policy;
and if the frame of the Heart and the matter of the Temptation
ſuit his deſign, he endeavours to <hi>turn the ſtream</hi> of our thoughts
either wholly <hi>another way,</hi> or to <hi>ſtill them</hi> by turning them into a
<hi>dead Sea,</hi> or by ſome trick to beguile the Underſtanding with ſome
<hi>new dreſs</hi> of the Temptation. So that we may obſerve in Satan
a <hi>threefold</hi> policy in a ſubſerviency to this deſign: for,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Satan ſometime <hi>ceaſeth</hi> his purſuit and lets the matter fall,
and thinks it better to <hi>change</hi> the Temptation than to <hi>continue</hi> a
ſollicitation at ſo great a diſadvantage. When he tempted Chriſt
and could not prevail,<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 13.</note> he <hi>departed for a ſeaſon</hi> with a purpoſe to
return at ſome fitter time, which Chriſt himſelf was in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of, knowing it to be his manner to ly in wait for advantages,
and accordingly when his ſuffering drew nigh, which (as he ſpeaks
to the Jews,)<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 53.</note> was <hi>their hour and power of darkneſs,</hi> he foretold his
return upon him, <hi>Now the Prince of this World cometh:</hi> however,
this attempt of his againſt the <hi>Lord Jeſus prevailed</hi> not, yet he
ſhewed his <hi>Art and Skill</hi> in the <hi>ſuſpending</hi> of his Temptation to a
more ſutable time. And the ſucceſs of this againſt us is ſadly
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49412:60"/>
remarkable, for however we reſiſt, and at preſent ſtand out, yet
his ſolicitations are often like <hi>leaven,</hi> which while 'tis hid in our
thoughts, doth not a little <hi>ferment</hi> and change them, ſo that at
his return, he often finds our <hi>Luſts prepared</hi> to raiſe greater clouds
upon our Mind. Many there are that <hi>reſiſt</hi> ſtrongly at preſent
that which they <hi>eaſily ſlide</hi> into, when Satan hath given them
<hi>time to breath;</hi> that <hi>ſay I will not,</hi> and yet <hi>do it afterwards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, He ſometimes withdraws their conſiderations, by
<hi>huffing them up with a confidence that they are above the Temptation:</hi> As
a <hi>conqueſt</hi> in a ſmall <hi>skirmiſh,</hi> begetting an <hi>opinion</hi> of victory, makes
way for a <hi>total</hi> overthrow over a careleſs and ſecure Army. We
are too apt to triumph over Temptations, becauſe we give the
firſt on-ſet with <hi>courage</hi> and reſolution. Chriſt forewarned <hi>Peter</hi>
of his denyal, he ſtoutly <hi>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ies</hi> it, and not improving this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
to Fear and Watchfulneſs, Satan who then was upon a
deſign to <hi>ſift him,</hi> took him at that advantage of <hi>ſecurity,</hi> and by
a contemptible inſtrument overthrew him. Thus while we grow
ſtrong in our apprehenſions by a denyal of a Sin, and undervalue
it as below us, our Confidence makes us careleſs, and this lets in
our ruine.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If theſe ways of Policy fail him, he <hi>ſeemingly complies
with us, and is content we judge the matter ſinful, but then he proffers
his ſervice to bring us off by diſtinctions;</hi> and here the Sophiſter uſeth
his skill to further our Underſtanding in framing <hi>excuſes,</hi> coyning
<hi>evaſions,</hi> and ſo doth <hi>out-ſhoot</hi> us in our <hi>own Bow.</hi> The <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
had learned to diſtinguiſh betwixt eating of Meat in an <hi>Idols</hi>
Temple in <hi>honour to the Idol,</hi> and as a <hi>common Feaſt</hi> in civility and
reſpect to their Friends that invited them: this preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
their conſideration, and ſo quieted them in that courſe,
that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was forced to diſcover the fallacy of it. The
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> curſed him that gave a Wife to any of the Tribe of
<hi>Benjamin:</hi> but when they turned to them in compaſſion, they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
themſelves with this poor diſtinction, that they would not
<hi>give them Wives,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Judg. 21. 18, 20.</note> but were willing to <hi>ſuffer them to take them.</hi> 'Tis
a common ſnare in matters of Promiſe, or Oath, where Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is ſtartled at a <hi>direct violation</hi> thereof, by ſome pitiful <hi>ſalvo,</hi> or
<hi>ſilly evaſion,</hi> to blind the Eyes; and when they dare not <hi>break</hi> the
Hedge, to <hi>leap over</hi> it by the help of a <hi>broken Reed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I muſt here further obſerve, that Satan doth ſometimes ſet
aſide theſe Deceits aforementioned, and trys his ſtrength for the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49412:61"/>
withdrawing of our conſideration from the danger of Sin, in a
more <hi>plain and direct</hi> manner, that is, <hi>by continuing the proſpect of
the ſweets and pleaſures of Sin under our Eye, and withal, urging us
by repeated ſollicitations to caſt the thoughts of the danger behind our
back:</hi> In which he ſo far prevails ſometimes, that Men are charged
with a deep <hi>forgetfulneſs</hi> of God, his Law, and of themſelves,
yet uſually it ariſeth to this by degrees: As</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When a Temptation is before us, and our conſcience
<hi>relucts</hi> it, if there be any inclination to <hi>recede</hi> from a conviction,
the motion is reſiſted with a <hi>ſecret regret</hi> and ſorrow. As the young
Man was ſaid to <hi>go away ſorrowful,</hi> when Chriſt propounded ſuch
terms for Eternal Life as he was not willing to hear of: So do
we, our Heart is divided betwixt <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> and
we begin to wiſh that it might be <hi>lawful</hi> to commit ſuch a Sin,
or that there were <hi>no danger</hi> in it; nay, often our <hi>wiſhes</hi> contradict
our <hi>prayers,</hi> and while we deſire to be delivered from the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
our private wiſhes beg a denyal to thoſe ſupplications.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, If we come thus far, we uſually proceed to the next
ſtep, which is, to</hi> give a diſmiſſion to thoſe thoughts that oppoſe the
Sin: <hi>We ſay to them, as</hi> Felix <hi>to</hi> Paul, Go thy way for this time,
and when I have a convenient opportunity I will ſend for thee.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If a plain diſmiſſion ſerve not to repel theſe thoughts,
we begin to <hi>impriſon the Truth in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note> and by a more
peremptory refuſal to ſtifle it,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 5.</note> and to keep it under, and become
at laſt <hi>willingly ignorant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, By this means at laſt the Heart grows <hi>ſottiſh and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful:</hi>
The heart is <hi>taken away,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, and then
do theſe thoughts of conviction and warning at preſent <hi>periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
This withdrawing of our conſideration is Satan's third
way of blinding us. Follows next</p>
                     <p>The fourth way by which our Luſt prevails in Satan's hand to
blind Knowledg, and that is by <hi>diſtracting and diſturbing it in its
work.</hi> This piece of ſubtilty Satan the rather uſeth, becauſe 'tis
attended with a double advantage, and like a <hi>two-edged ſword</hi>
will cut either way. For (1.) A <hi>confuſion</hi> and diſtraction in the
Underſtanding, will hinder the <hi>even</hi> and clear <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of
things, ſo that thoſe principles of Knowledg cannot reach ſo deep,
nor be ſo firm and full in their application: For as the Senſes, if
any way diſtracted or hindred, though never ſo intent, muſt needs
ſuffer prejudice in their operations; a thick Air or Miſt not only
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49412:61"/>
hinders the ſight of the Eye, but alſo conduceth to a miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Objects: Thus is the Underſtanding hindred by confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
But (2.) If this ſucceed not, yet by this he hinders the
<hi>peace and comfort</hi> of God's Children: 'Tis a trouble to be haunted
with evil thoughts. To work this diſtraction.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Satan uſeth a <hi>clamorous importunity,</hi> and doth ſo follow
us with Suggeſtions, that what way ſoever we turn they follow
us; we can think nothing elſe, or hear nothing elſe, they are ever
before us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He worketh this diſturbance in our thoughts by <hi>levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a legion</hi> of Temptations againſt us; <hi>many at once,</hi> and of <hi>ſeveral
kinds,</hi> from <hi>within,</hi> from <hi>without,</hi> on every ſide, he gathers all
from the <hi>Dan</hi> to the <hi>Berſheba</hi> of his <hi>Empire</hi> to oppreſs us with a
multitude; ſo that while our thoughts are <hi>divided</hi> about many
things, they are <hi>leſs fixed</hi> and obſervant in any particular.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He ſometimes endeavours to <hi>weary us out with long Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations.</hi>
As thoſe that beſiege a City, when they cannot <hi>ſtorm,</hi>
endeavour to waſte their Strength and Proviſions by a <hi>long Siege:</hi>
His deſign in this is to come upon us (as <hi>Ahitophel</hi> counſelled
<hi>Abſolom)</hi> when we are <hi>weary and weak-handed</hi> by watching and
long reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, But his chief deſign is to take the <hi>advantage of any
trouble inward or outward,</hi> and by the help of this he dangerouſly
<hi>diſcompoſeth</hi> and diſtracts our Counſels and Reſolves. If any have a
Spirit diſtemper'd, only under the apprehenſions of Wrath, 'tis eaſie
for him to confound and <hi>amaze</hi> ſuch, that they ſhall ſcarce know
what they <hi>do,</hi> or what they <hi>think.</hi> The like advantage he hath
from outward Afflictions, and theſe opportunities he the rather
takes, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Uſually inward or outward troubles leaves ſome <hi>ſtamp of
murmuring</hi> and fullenneſs upon our Hearts, and of themſelves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
our Spirits with a ſad inclination, <hi>to ſpeak in our haſte,</hi> or
<hi>to act unadviſedly. Job</hi>'s affliction imbittered his Spirit, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
miſſeth not the advantage; then he comes upon him with
Temptations, and prevailed ſo far, that he ſpake many things in
his anguiſh, of which he was aſhamed afterward, and hides his
face for it;<note place="margin">Job 40. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer: yea, twice, but I
will proceed no further.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, By reaſon of our Burthen we are <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſs weildy,</hi> and
more unapt to make any reſiſtance. God himſelf expreſſeth the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49412:62"/>
condition of ſuch, under the ſimilitude of thoſe <hi>that are great with
young,</hi> who becauſe they cannot be driven faſt, he <hi>gently leads</hi>
them: But Satan knows a ſmall matter will diſcompoſe them,
and herein he deals with us, as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> dealt with the
<hi>Sechemites</hi> who ſet upon them when they were <hi>ſore</hi> by circumciſion.</p>
                     <p>Thirldly, Troubles <hi>of themſelves</hi> occaſion <hi>Confuſion,</hi> multitudes
of Thoughts, Diſtractions and Inadvertencies. If Men ſee a
hazard before them they are preſently at their wits end, they are
puzled, they know not what to do, thoughts are divided, now
reſolving this, then preſently changing to a contrary purpoſe.
'Tis ſeldom but <hi>as in a multitude of words there is much folly,</hi> ſo in a
diſtraction of Thoughts there are many Miſcarriages, and Satan
with a little labour can improve them to more; here he works
unſeen, in theſe <hi>troubled Waters</hi> he loves to angle, becauſe his
Baits are not diſcerned.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Our Conſiderations and Reaſonings againſt Sin are
hindred by a <hi>bold forward precipitancy.</hi> When Men are haſted and
preſſed to the committing of Sin, and like the <hi>deaf Addar</hi> ſtop
their Ears againſt <hi>the voice of the Charmer:</hi> in this caſe the rebellious
<hi>Will</hi> is like a <hi>furious</hi> Horſe, that takes the <hi>Bridle in his Teeth,</hi> and
inſtead of <hi>ſubmitting</hi> to the government of his Rider, he carries
him violently whither he would not. Thus do Men ruſh into
Sin as the Horſe into the Battel. The devices by which Satan doth
forward this, we may obſerve to be theſe among others.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He endeavours to <hi>affright</hi> Men into an <hi>hopeleſneſs of prevailing
againſt him,</hi> and ſo intimidates Men that they throw down their
Weapons, and yield up themſelves to the Temptation; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
there is no hope by all their reſiſtance to ſtand it out againſt
him, and then they are eaſily perſwaded to comply with him. To
help this forward, Satan uſeth the Policy of <hi>Souldiers,</hi> who uſually
<hi>boaſt</hi> high of their <hi>ſtrength</hi> and reſolutions, that the hearts and
<hi>courage</hi> of their Adverſaries failing, the <hi>Victory</hi> may fall to them
without <hi>ſtroke.</hi> The Devil expreſſeth a diſdain and ſcorn of our
weak oppoſition, as <hi>Goliah</hi> did of <hi>David, Am I a Dog, that thou
comeſt to me with Staves? doeſt thou think to ſtand it out againſt me?
'tis in vain to buckle on thine Armour, and therefore better were it to
ſave the trouble of ſtriving than to fight to no purpoſe.</hi> With ſuch like
arguings as theſe, are Men ſometimes prevailed with to throw
down their Weapons, and to over-run their Reaſon through fear
and hopeleſneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:49412:62"/>
Secondly, Sometimes he is more ſubtile, and <hi>by threaping Men
down, that they have conſented already, he puts them upon deſperate
adventures of going forward.</hi> This is uſually where Satan hath
uſed <hi>many</hi> ſollicitations <hi>before,</hi> after our hearts have been urged
ſtrongly with a Temptation; when he ſees he cannot win us over
to him, then he <hi>triumphs</hi> and boaſts we are <hi>conquered already,</hi> and
that our thoughts could not have <hi>dwelt</hi> ſo long upon ſuch a <hi>ſubject,</hi>
but that we had a <hi>liking</hi> to it, and thence would perſwade us to
go on and enjoy the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of that delight which we have already
<hi>ſtoln</hi> privately, <hi>over Shooes, over Boots.</hi> Now though his arguings
here be very weak, (for though it be granted, that by the ſtay of
the Temptation on our thoughts he hath a <hi>little entangled</hi> us, it
cannot hence be inferred that it is our wiſdom to entangle our
ſelves <hi>further,)</hi> yet are many overcome herewith, and give up
themſelves as already conquered, and ſo give a ſtop to any further
conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When Men will not be <hi>trapanned</hi> into the Snare by
the former deluſions, he attempts to work them up to a <hi>ſudden
and haſty reſolve of ſinning;</hi> he prepares all the materials of the
Sin, puts every thing in order, and then carries us (as he did
Chriſt) into the Mountain, to give us a proſpect of their beauty
and glory: <hi>All theſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will I give thee; do but conſent,
and all are thine.</hi> Now, albeit there are arguments at hand, and
ſerious conſiderations to deter us from practice, yet how are all
laid aſide by a quick reſolve? Satan urgeth us by violent <hi>hurry,</hi>
(as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Judas) what thou haſt to do, do it quickly;</hi> the
Soul perſwaded with this puts on a ſudden boldneſs and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and when Reaſon doth offer to <hi>interpoſe, it holds faſt the door,</hi>
becauſe the <hi>ſound of its Maſters feet is behind it;</hi> doth it not ſay
to it ſelf, <hi>Come, we will not conſider, let us do it quickly before theſe
lively conſiderations come in to hinder us;</hi> 'tis loth to be reſtrained,
and conceiteth, that if it can be done <hi>before Conſcience awaken</hi> and
make a noiſe, all is well; as if Sin <hi>ceaſed</hi> to be ſinful, becauſe we
by a violent haſte endeavoured to <hi>prevent</hi> the admonition of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
Thus they enjoy their Sin (as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> eat their
Paſſover) <hi>in haſte, and with their ſtaves in their hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When Opportunities and Occaſions will well ſuit it,
He takes the advantages of a <hi>paſſionate and ſullen Humor,</hi> and by
this means he turns us clearly out of our Byaſs: Reaſon is tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
under-foot, and Paſſion quite over-runs it. At this diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49412:63"/>
the Devil takes <hi>Jonah,</hi> and hardens him to a ſtrange
<hi>reſolve</hi> of quarrelling God, and <hi>juſtifying</hi> himſelf in that Inſolency.
The <hi>Humor</hi> that Satan wrought upon, was his <hi>fretful ſullenneſs</hi>
raiſed up to a great height by the diſappointment of his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and this makes him break out into a <hi>Cholerick</hi> reſolution,
<hi>I do well to be angry.</hi> Had he been compoſed in his Spirit, had his
Mind been calm and ſedate, the Devil (ſurely) could not by any
arguments have drawn him up to it; but when the <hi>Spirit</hi> is in a
<hi>rage,</hi> a <hi>little</hi> matter will <hi>bind</hi> Reaſon in <hi>Chains,</hi> and puſh a Man
upon a <hi>deſperate careleſneſs</hi> of any danger that may follow; ſutable
to that expreſſion of <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 13. 13. <hi>Let me alone that I may
ſpeak, and let come on me what will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, All theſe are but ſmall in compariſon of thoſe <hi>deliberate
determinations which are to be found with moſt Sinners,</hi> who are
therefore ſaid to ſin with an <hi>high hand, preſumptuouſly, wilfully,
againſt Conſcience, againſt Knowledg,</hi> and this ordinarily to be found
only among thoſe whom a <hi>cuſtom</hi> of Sin hath hardned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
into a <hi>boldneſs</hi> of a wicked way and courſe. When the
ſpirits of Men are thus <hi>harneſſed</hi> and prepared, Satan can at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
almoſt <hi>form</hi> them into a <hi>deliberate reſolve,</hi> to <hi>caſt the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
behind their back,</hi> and <hi>to refuſe to hearken.</hi> When any Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is offered them, if God ſay, <hi>Ask for the old paths, and walk
therein,</hi> (as <hi>Jer. 6. 16.)</hi> they will readily anſwer, <hi>We will not
walk therein:</hi> If God ſay, <hi>Hearken to the ſound of the Trumpet:</hi> they
will reply, <hi>We will not hearken.</hi> When the People by a courſe of
ſinning had made themſelves like the <hi>wild Aſs</hi> uſed to the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
then did they peremptorily <hi>ſet up their</hi> Will againſt all the
<hi>Reaſon</hi> and Conſideration that could come in to deter them, though
they were told the inconveniences, <hi>(Jer. 2. 25.)</hi> that this did
<hi>unſhoo</hi> their Foot, and afflicted them with <hi>Thirſt and Want,</hi> yet
was the advice ſlighted, <hi>there is no hope</hi> (ſaid they,) there is no
expectation that we will take any notice of theſe pleadings, for
we have <hi>fixed</hi> our reſolve, <hi>We have loved Strangers, and after them
will we go.</hi> So <hi>Jer. 44. 16. As for the word that thou haſt ſpoken
unto us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee, but we
will certainly do whatſoever thing goeth out of our own Mouth.</hi> A plain
and <hi>full reſolve</hi> of Will diſchargeth all the <hi>powers of Reaſon,</hi> and
commands it ſilence. And that this is moſt ordinary among Men,
may appear by theſe frequent expreſſions of Scripture, wherein
God lays the blame of all that madneſs which their lives bring
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49412:63"/>
forth upon their <hi>Will, Ye would not obey, ye will not come to me;
their heart is ſet to do evil,</hi> &amp;c. It may indeed ſeem ſtrange that
Satan ſhould proceed ſo far with the generality of Men, and that
they ſhould do that that ſhould ſeem ſo inconſiſtent with thoſe
Principles which they retain, and the Light which muſt reſult
from thence: But we muſt remember, that theſe <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>ſhalls</hi>
of wicked Men, are for the moſt part <hi>God's interpretation</hi> of their
Acts and Carriage, which ſpeaks as much, though it may be their
Minds and Hearts do not ſo <hi>formally</hi> mould up their Thoughts
into ſuch open and <hi>brazen-fac'd</hi> aſſertions. And yet we ought
alſo further to conſider, that when the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God chargeth
Man with <hi>wilfulneſs,</hi> there is ſurely more of a <hi>formal wilfulneſs</hi>
in the heart of Man than lyeth open to <hi>our view.</hi> And this will be
leſs ſtrange to us when we call to mind,</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That through the working of Satan the Minds of
Men are darkned, and the light thereof put out by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency
of <hi>Atheiſtical Principles.</hi>

There are, it may be, few that are <hi>profeſſed</hi> Atheiſts in
<hi>Opinion,</hi> and Dogmatically ſo, but all <hi>wicked</hi> Men are ſo <hi>in Practice;</hi>
though they profeſs God, yet <hi>the Fool ſaith in his heart, there is
no God,</hi> and in <hi>their works they deny him.</hi> This is a Principle
that directly ſtrikes at the root: for if there be <hi>no God, no Hell</hi>
or Puniſhment, who will be <hi>ſcared</hi> from taking his delight in
Sin by any ſuch conſideration? The Devil therefore ſtrives to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil
this Poyſon with his Temptation. When he enticed <hi>Eve</hi> by
ſecret inſinuations, he firſt <hi>queſtions</hi> the truth of the threatning,
and then proceeds to an open <hi>denyal</hi> of it, <hi>ye ſhall not ſurely die;</hi> and
'tis plain, ſhe was induced to the Sin upon a <hi>ſecret disbelief</hi> of the
danger; ſhe reckons up the advantages, <hi>good for Food, pleaſant to
the Eye, to be deſired to make one wiſe;</hi> wherein 'tis evident ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
what Satan had affirmed, <hi>that they ſhould be as God,</hi> and
then it was not to be feared that they ſhould die. This kind of
<hi>Atheiſm</hi> is common; Men may not <hi>disbelieve</hi> a Godhead, nay they
may <hi>believe there is a God,</hi> and yet <hi>queſtion</hi> the truth of his <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</hi>
Thoſe conceits that Men have of God, whereby they <hi>mould</hi>

                     <p>HAving explained the <hi>five</hi> ways by which Satan through the
power of Luſt cauſeth blindneſs of Mind in tempting to
Sin, I ſhall next lay open Satan's Devices for the <hi>keeping and
maintaining his Poſſeſſion,</hi> which are theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He endeavours (after he hath prevailed with any Man
to commit an Iniquity) to <hi>finiſh Sin,</hi> Jam. 1. 15. <hi>After 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
and <hi>brought forth,</hi> then 'tis <hi>finiſhed;</hi> which notes its growth
and increaſe. This compriſeth theſe <hi>two</hi> things, its <hi>Reiteration,</hi>
and its <hi>Aggravation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Its <hi>Reiteration,</hi> is when by <hi>frequent acts</hi> it is ſtrengthned,
and confirmed into an <hi>habit.</hi> There are various <hi>ſteps</hi> by which
Men aſcend into the <hi>ſeat of the Scornful, Nemo repent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> turpiſſimus,</hi>
'Tis not <hi>one act</hi> that doth denominate Men <hi>wiſe to do evil.</hi> In
<hi>Pſal. 1. David</hi> ſhews there are <hi>gradations</hi> and degrees of Sin, ſome
<hi>walk in the counſel of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly;</hi> ſome by progreſs and continuance
of Sin <hi>ſtand in the way of Sinners;</hi> ſome by a hardneſs of Heart
and fixedneſs in wicked Purpoſes, <hi>ſit in the ſeat of the Scornful.</hi>
To this height doth he labour to bring his Proſelytes, yet he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſigns,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That Sin may have its utmoſt accompliſhments in
<hi>all the aggravations</hi> whereof it may be capable. He ſtrives to put
Men upon ſuch a courſe of ſinning as may be <hi>moſt ſcandalous</hi> to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49412:64"/>
the Goſpel, <hi>moſt enſnaring</hi> and offenſive to others, <hi>moſt hardning</hi>
and deſperate to our ſelves, <hi>moſt offenſive</hi> and provoking to God;
in this he imitates the counſel of <hi>Ahitophel</hi> to <hi>Abſalom,</hi> when he
adviſed him to go in unto his Fathers Concubines in the ſight of
all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ſo the breach betwixt him and his Father might
be widned to an impoſſibility of reconciliation. Thus he labours
that Sinners ſhould act at ſuch a rate of open defiance againſt
Heaven, as if they <hi>reſolved to ly down</hi> in their iniquity, and were
purpoſed <hi>never to think of returning</hi> and making up their peace
with God. That Sin may be finiſhed in both theſe reſpects, he
uſeth theſe Policies;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, After Sin is <hi>once</hi> committed, he <hi>renews</hi> his Motions and
Sollicitations to act it <hi>again,</hi> and then again, and ſo onward
till they be perfect and habituated to it. In this caſe he acts
over again the <hi>former method</hi> by which he firſt enſnared them,
only with ſuch alterations as the preſent caſe doth neceſſitate him
unto; before he urged for the committing of it but <hi>once,</hi> (how
little is he to be truſted in theſe promiſes,) now he urgeth them
by the <hi>very act</hi> they have already done, <hi>Is it not a pleaſant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
ſin to thy very experience? haſt thou not taſted and ſeen? haſt thou
not already conſented? taſte and try again, and yet further, withdraw not
thy hand.</hi> A little Temptation ſerved before, but a leſs ſerves now;
for by yielding to the <hi>firſt</hi> Temptation, our hearts are ſecretly <hi>enclined</hi>
to the Sin, and we carry a greater affection to it than before: for this
is the <hi>ſtain</hi> and defilement of Sin, that when once committed, it
leaves <hi>impreſſions of delight</hi> and love behind, which are ſtill the more
<hi>augmented</hi> by a further <hi>progreſs</hi> and frequent commiſſion, till at
laſt by a ſtrong power of <hi>faſcination</hi> it bewitches Men that they
<hi>cannot forbear;</hi> all the entreaties of Friends, all their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
all their Reſolves and Purpoſes, though never ſo ſtrong
and ſerious (except God ſtrike in to reſcue by an omnipotent
hand) can no more reſtrain them than <hi>fetters of Straw</hi> can hold
a <hi>Giant.</hi> God himſelf owns it as a <hi>natural impoſſibility, Can the
Ethiopian change his skin? no more can ye do good;</hi> and the reaſon
of that impoſſibility is from hence, that they are <hi>accuſtomed to
do evil.</hi> Such ſtrong and powerful inclinations to the ſame ſin
again are begot in us by a ſin already committed, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<hi>one act</hi> of ſin fills ſome Men with as <hi>vehement</hi> and <hi>paſſionate
deſires</hi> for a further enjoyment, as <hi>cuſtom</hi> and continuance doth
others. <hi>Auſtin</hi> reports that <hi>Alipius</hi> when once he gave way to the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49412:65"/>
Temptation of beholding the <hi>Gladiators,</hi> was bewitched with
ſuch a delight, that he not only deſired to come again <hi>with
others,</hi> but alſo <hi>before others.</hi> Neither is it any great wonder it
ſhould be ſo, when (beſides the Inclinations that are begot in
us by any act of Sin ro recommit it) Sin puts us <hi>out of God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
debilitates</hi> and weakens our Graces, <hi>ſtrengthens</hi> Satan's
Arm, and often <hi>procures</hi> him further power and commiſſion
againſt us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Satan endeavours to make one Sin an <hi>engagement</hi>
to another, and to force Men to <hi>draw Iniquity with cords of Vanity.
Agur</hi> notes a concatenation in Sins,<note place="margin">Prov. 30. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>leſt I ſteal and take the Name
of God in vain. Adam</hi> ſinning in the forbidden Fruit, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
guilty by his Conſcience, runs into another ſin for the
excuſe of the former, <hi>the Woman that thou gaveſt me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>David</hi>
affords a ſad inſtance of this, the ſin with <hi>Bathſheba</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and ſhe with Child upon it, <hi>David</hi> to hide the ſhame of
his offence (1) <hi>Hypocritically</hi> pretends great kindneſs to <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi>
(2.) When that ſerved not, next he makes him <hi>drunk,</hi> and it
may be he <hi>involved</hi> many others in that ſin as <hi>Acceſſories.</hi> (3.) When
this courſe failed, his heart conceives a purpoſe and reſolution
to <hi>murther</hi> him. (4.) He cruelly makes him the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of his
<hi>own</hi> deſtruction. (5.) He engageth <hi>Joab</hi> in it. (6.) And the
death of <hi>many</hi> of his Souldiers. (7.) By this puts the whole
<hi>Army</hi> upon an <hi>hazard.</hi> (8.) <hi>Excuſeth</hi> the bloody contrivance,
by <hi>Providence.</hi> (9.) In all uſing ſtill the <hi>height</hi> of diſſimulation.
Satan knows how natural it is for Men to hide the <hi>ſhame</hi> of their
iniquity, and accordingly provides occaſions, and provocations
to drive them on to a kind of neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By a <hi>perverſe repreſentation of the ſtate of godly and wicked
Men,</hi> he draws on Sin to an higher compleatment. How often
doth he ſet before us the Miſery, Affliction, Contempt, Croſſes,
and Sadneſſes of the one, and the Jollity, Delights, Plenty, Peace,
Honours, and Power of the other? It was a Temptation that
had almoſt brought <hi>David</hi> to an <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> reſolve againſt all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
duty, and that which he obſerved had prevailed altogether
with many Profeſſors, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. When they obſerved <hi>they were
not in trouble like other Men,</hi> and that their Mouth and Tongue had
been inſolent againſt God, without any rebuke or check from
him; when in the mean time, the Godly <hi>were plagued all the day,</hi>
and <hi>chaſtned every morning:</hi> ſome (that were in profeſſion, or eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49412:65"/>
at leaſt, God's People) returned to take up theſe thoughts,
and to reſolve upon ſuch practices, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. as if God who ſets
all theſe with ſo much ſilence, muſt be ſuppoſed knowingly to
give ſome countenance to ſuch actions. This indeed (when
'tis proſecuted upon our hearts in its full ſtrength with thoſe ugly
ſurmiſes, jealouſies, and miſapprehenſions that are wont to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
it) is a ſad ſtep to a deſperate neglect of duty and a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
in ſinning, in that it <hi>inſenſibly</hi> introduceth <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
upon the hearts of Men, and ſuch are apt to catch hold,
even upon good Men, who are but too ready to ſay, as <hi>David, I
have cleanſed my hands in vain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Satan hath yet another piece of Policy for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
and aggravation of Sin, which is the <hi>enmity and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law.</hi> Of this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſadly complains from
his own experience, <hi>Rom. 7. 8. Sin taking occaſion by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence.</hi> What he laments is
this, that ſuch is the <hi>perverſneſs</hi> of our natures, that the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>reſtraining</hi> us doth the more <hi>enrage</hi> us, ſo that <hi>accidentally</hi>
the Law doth multiply Sin: for when the reſtraint of the Law
is before us, Luſt burns not only more inwardly, but when it
cannot be kept in and ſmothered, then it breaks out with greater
violence, <hi>Let us break their bonds aſunder,</hi> &amp;c. When the Law
condemns our Luſts, they grow ſurly and deſperate, <hi>Let us eat and
drink, for to morrow we die,</hi> &amp;c. If any wonder that the Law
(which was given of purpoſe to repreſs Sin, and which is of ſo
great uſe in its authority to kill it in us, and to hinder Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,)
ſhould thus be uſed by Satan to encreaſe and enrage it,
they may conſider that 'tis but ſtill an <hi>accidental occaſion,</hi> and not
a <hi>cauſe,</hi> and Sin <hi>takes this occaſion</hi> without any fault of the Law.
Satan to this end<note n="†" place="margin">As <hi>Abſalom</hi> his ſervants watched when <hi>Amnon</hi>'s heart was merry with Wine.</note> 
                        <hi>watcheth</hi> the time when our hearts are moſt <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly</hi>
ſet upon our Luſts, when our deſires are moſt highly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
and then by a <hi>ſubtile Art</hi> ſo oppoſeth the Law (letting
in it's contradictions in way and meaſure ſutable) that our hearts
conceive <hi>a grudge</hi> at reſtraint, which together with its <hi>earneſtneſs</hi>
to <hi>ſatisfy the Fleſh,</hi> ariſeth up to a <hi>furious madneſs,</hi> and violent
ſtriving to maintain a liberty and freedom to do according to the
deſires of their heart; whereas this <hi>ſame Law,</hi> if it be applyed to
the heart when 'tis <hi>more cooled</hi> and not ſo <hi>highly engaged</hi> upon a
deſign of Luſt, will <hi>break, terrify,</hi> and <hi>reſtrain</hi> the heart, and put
ſuch a <hi>damp</hi> upon Temptations that they ſhall not be able to ſtand
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49412:66"/>
before it. So great a difference is there in the <hi>various ſeaſons</hi> of
the application of this Law; in which Art, for the enflaming of
the heart to iniquity, Satan ſhews a wonderful dexterity.</p>

                        <hi>till a dart ſtrike through their liver,</hi> and haſtens them to the
ſnare, <hi>as a bird that knoweth not that it is for his life.</hi> They that ſhall
conſider, that the heart of a ſinner is hardned through the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of Sin; and that the greateſt part of the affrightment
that moleſts the conſciences of ſuch, is from Satan's <hi>fury</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice;
they will eaſily conceive how much his <hi>ſingle</hi> forbearance to
moleſt, may contribute to the peace and eaſe of thoſe that are <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon their lees:</hi> but beſides his forbearance, we may expect that
what ever <hi>clouds</hi> or <hi>darkneſs</hi> he can raiſe to exclude the Light, or to
muffle the eyes, he will not be negligent in the uſe of that power
whatever he can poſitively do in the raiſing up the <hi>confidence</hi> of
preſumption or ſecurity in the Minds of Men; what ever he can
do to make them <hi>ſottiſh</hi> or careleſs, that ſhall not be wanting.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he ſhews no leſs skill, and diligence by <hi>ſecret contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances</hi>
to <hi>hinder</hi> occaſions of reproof; and diſcovery; how much
he can practiſe upon others, that out of pity and compaſſion to
the Souls of Men, are ready to draw a ſinner <hi>from the errour of his
way, and to ſave a Soul from death.</hi> We can ſcarce imagine what
ways he hath to <hi>divert</hi> and hinder them, by what private <hi>diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements</hi>
he doth defer them, who can tell? He that could diſpute
with the <hi>Angel</hi> about the body of <hi>Moſes</hi> to prevent the ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment
of it:<note place="margin">Jud. 9.</note> he that could give a <hi>ſtop</hi> of One and twenty days
to the Angel that was to bring the comfortable Meſſage to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 34. 6.</note> of the hearing of his Prayers, may more eaſily <hi>obſtruct</hi> and
oppoſe the deſigns of a faithful reprover. Some time he doth
this by <hi>viſible</hi> means and inſtruments, ſtirring up the Spirits of
wicked men to give oppoſition to ſuch as ſeek to deliver their
Souls from the blood of men, by faithful warnings or exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
The Devil was ſo careful to keep <hi>Jeroboam</hi> quiet in his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49412:67"/>
courſe of Idolatry, that he ſtirs up <hi>Amaziah</hi> to baniſh <hi>Amos</hi>
from the Court, leſt his plain dealing ſhould ſtartle or awaken the
Conſcience of the King; <hi>Amos 7. 12, 13. Go, flee thee away into the
land of Judah,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but Propheſie not any more at Bethel, for it is the
Kings Chappel, it is the Kings Court.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In order to the keeping out the Light from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of Men, he inſinuates himſelf as <hi>a lying Spirit, into the
mouthes</hi> of ſome of his <hi>mercenaries;</hi> and they ſpeak <hi>ſmooth things</hi>
and <hi>deceit</hi> to Satan's Captives; telling them, that they are in a
good condition; Chriſtians good enough, and may go to Heaven
as well as the preciſeſt: 'tis a fault in <hi>unfaithful Miniſters,</hi> they do
the Devil this ſervice, God highly complains of it. <hi>Jer. 6. 14.
They have healed alſo the hurt of the daughter of my people ſlightly,
ſaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.</hi> Ezek. 13. 10. <hi>They have
ſeduced my people, ſaying, Peace, and there was no peace: and one built
up a Wall and others daubed it with untempered morter.</hi> Beſides, this
Stratagem is the more likely to prevail, becauſe it takes the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the <hi>humours,</hi> and inclinations of Men, who naturally
think <hi>the beſt</hi> of themſelves, and delight that others ſhould ſpeak
what <hi>they would have them;</hi> ſo that when Men by the Devil's
inſtigation propheſie deceit to ſinful Men, 'tis moſt likely they
ſhould be heard, ſeeing they deſire ſuch Prophets, <hi>and love to
have it ſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Satan keeps off the Light, by <hi>catching away the Word
after it is ſown.</hi> This policy of his, Chriſt expreſly diſcovers, <hi>Math. 13.
19. When anyone heareth the Word of the Kingdom and underſtandeth
it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was
ſown in his heart:</hi> ſuch opportunities the Devil doth narrowly
watch; to be ſure he will be preſent at a Sermon, or good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and if he perceive any thing ſpoken that may endanger
his peaceable Poſſeſſion, how buſie is he to withdraw the heart,
ſometime by the <hi>ſight</hi> of the Eyes, ſometimes by <hi>vain thoughts</hi> of
buſineſs, occaſions, delights, and what not; and if this come not
up to his end, then he endeavours, <hi>after Men have heard,</hi> to juſtle
all out by <hi>impertinent Diſcourſes, urgencies</hi> of Imployment, and a
thouſand ſuch divertiſements, that ſo Men may not lay the warning
to heart, nor by ſerious meditation to apply it to their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, He ſometimes <hi>ſnuffs</hi> out the Light by Perſecution.
Thoſe hearers <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20, 21. that had received the Word with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49412:67"/>
ſome workings of affections and joy, are <hi>preſently offended when
Perſecution, becauſe of the Word, ariſeth.</hi> By this, he threatens Men
into an acquieſcency in their preſent condition, that if <hi>they depart
from iniquity, they ſhall make themſelves a prey:</hi> Bonds, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Hatreds (he ſuggeſts) ſhall abide them, and by this
means he ſcares Men from the Light.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, He ſometimes <hi>ſmothers</hi> and choaks it with the <hi>Cares of
the World.</hi> As thoſe that received Seed among Thornes; by ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
engagements in buſineſs, all that time, ſtrength and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which ſhould have been laid out in the proſecution of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, are wholly taken up and ſpent on outward things;
by this means that Light that ſhines into the hearts of Men, is
neglected and put by.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, He ſtaves off Men from coming to the Light, by
putting them upon <hi>miſapprehenſions of their Eſtate,</hi> in judging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by the common opinion. Satan hath ſo far prevailed with
Men, that they are become confident of this conceit, <hi>That Men
may take a moderate liberty in Sinning, and yet nevertheleſs be in a
good condition; that Sin is not ſo great a matter in God's eſteem, as in
the judgment of ſome rigorous preciſian, that he will not be ſo extream
to mark what we do amiſs, as ſome ſtrict Profeſſours are.</hi> What can
be of greater hindrance to that ingenuous ſearch, ſtrict examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and impartial judging, or ſhaming our ſelves for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
(which the Light of Scripture would engage us unto)
than ſuch a conceit as this? and yet that this opinion is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
common, but ancient, is manifeſt by thoſe warnings and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
given by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the contrary. <hi>Gal. 6. 7. Be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
God is not mocked; whatſoever a Man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap.</hi>
Eph. 5. 6. <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words, for becauſe of theſe
things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience.</hi> If
it had not been uſual for Men to live in Uncleanneſs, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs
and ſuch like offences (which he calls <hi>ſowing to the fleſh)</hi> and
yet in the midſt of theſe, to think they were not under the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of Wrath; or if Men had not profeſſedly and avowedly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
ſuch an opinion, it had been ſuperfluous for the Apoſtle to
have warned us with ſo much earneſtneſs, <hi>Be not deceived, let no
man deceive you with ſuch vain words.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eighthly, 'Tis uſual for Satan to ſtill and quiet the ſtirring
thoughts of Sinners <hi>with hopes and aſſurances of ſecreſie.</hi> As children
are quieted and pleaſed with toyes and rattles, ſo are Sinners
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49412:68"/>
put off, and diverted from proſecuting the diſcoveries that the
Light would make in them, by this confidence, <hi>that though they have
done amiſs, yet their miſcarriages ſhall not be laid open, or manifeſted
before Men.</hi> 'Tis incredible how much the hopes of concealment
doth ſatisfie and delight thoſe that have ſome ſenſe of Guilt.
Sometime Men are Impudent,<note place="margin">Iſa. 3. 9.</note> that <hi>they declare their Sin as</hi> Sodom,
<hi>they hide it not:</hi> But before they arrive at ſo great an Impudency,
they uſually <hi>ſeek deep to hide their counſel from the Lord, and their
works are in the dark; and they ſay, who ſeeth us? and who knoweth
us?</hi> Iſa. 29. 15. Like thoſe fooliſh Creatures that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſufficiently concealed by hiding their heads in a Buſh, though
all their bodies be expoſed to open view. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 15. Thoſe that
<hi>made lies their refuge, and under falſhood hid themſelves,</hi> became as
confident of their ſecurity, as if they had <hi>made a covenant with
death, and were at an agreement with hell;</hi> and when they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in this courſe for ſome time with impunity, the Light is
ſo baniſhed, that they carry it ſo, as if God obſerved their Actions
done in the dark,<note place="margin">Job. 22. 13.</note> as little as Men do. <hi>How doth God know?</hi> (ſay
they) <hi>can he judge through the dark clouds? thick clouds are a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to him that he ſeeth not;</hi> and hence proceed they to promiſe
themſelves a ſafety from judgements, <hi>When the overflowing ſcourge
ſhall paſs through, it ſhall not come nigh unto us, for we have made lies
our refuge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, Satan keeps them from going to the Light by <hi>demurrs</hi>
and <hi>delays.</hi> If the Light begin to break in upon their Conſciences,
then he tells them, that there is time enough afterward: <hi>Oh</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>thou art young and haſt many days before thee, 'tis time
enough to repent when you begin to be old: or, thou art a Servant, an
Apprentice under command, thou wanteſt fit opportunities and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
for ſerious conſideration defer till thou becomeſt free, and at thine
own diſpoſal.</hi> That this is one of Satan's deceits to hinder us from
making uſe of the Light; (beſides what common experience
may teach every Man) may be clearly gathered from the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Scripture, which do not only <hi>ſhew</hi> us, <hi>the way wherein
we ought to walk,</hi> but alſo <hi>preſs us</hi> to a preſent embracement of
that Counſel;<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>To day, to day, while it is called to day, harden not
your hearts.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Now is the accepted time; Now is the day of Salvation.
Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth before the evil day comes:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 1.</note>
                        <hi>if ye will enquire,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 21. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>enquire, yea return, come.</hi> This haſty urgency to
cloſe with the offered occaſions, plainly accuſe us of delays, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49412:68"/>
that it is uſual with us to adjourn thoſe thoughts to a fitter op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
which we are not willing to comply with for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                     <p>By theſe <hi>nine</hi> devices he keeps the Light from enſnared Sinners,
or them from coming to the Light. But if all this cannot draw
a curtain before the Sun, if its bright beams breaks through all,
ſo that it cannot be avoided, but there will be a manifeſtation and
diſcovery <hi>of the hidden things of darkneſs;</hi> then Satan uſeth all
his art and cunning to ſtir up in the hearts of Men their <hi>hatred
againſt the Light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is his Second grand piece of Policy to keep all in quiet
under his command, to which purpoſe,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He endeavours to draw on a hatred againſt the Light,
by raiſing in the minds of Men <hi>a prejudice againſt the perſon that
brings or offers it:</hi> if he that warns or reproves, expreſs himſelf
any thing <hi>warmly,</hi> or <hi>cuttingly</hi> againſt his brothers Sin, this the
Devil preſently makes uſe of; and thoſe that are concerned think
they have a juſt cauſe to <hi>ſtop their ears,</hi> and <hi>harden their necks,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they conceive, that <hi>anger,</hi> or <hi>ill-will,</hi> or ſome ſuch <hi>baſe thing</hi>
did dictate thoſe (though juſt) rebukes. The Devil turned the
heart of <hi>Ahab</hi> againſt the faithful warnings of <hi>Micaiah</hi> upon a
deep prejudice that he had taken up againſt him; for ſo he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
himſelf to <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 King. 22. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>I hate him, for he never propheſieth

                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>o me.</hi> In this caſe, Men conſider not how <hi>juſty,</hi> how
<hi>truly,</hi> how <hi>profitably</hi> any thing is ſpoken, but (as ſome Inſects that
feed upon Sores) they paſs by what is ſound and good, and fix
upon that which is corrupt and putrid, either through he <hi>weakneſs</hi>
and inobſervancy of the <hi>reprover,</hi> or pretended to be ſuch, by the
<hi>prejudice</hi> of the <hi>party</hi> which doth altogether diſable him to put a
right conſtruction upon any thing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If this help not, then he ſeeks to get the advantage
of a <hi>provoked,</hi> paſſionate, or otherwiſe diſtempered fit, and then
hatred is eaſily procured againſt any thing that comes in its
way.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Satan endeavours to engage our hatred againſt the
Light, by preſenting our <hi>intereſt as ſhaken,</hi> or endangered by it.
If Intereſt can be drawn in, and made a party, 'tis not difficult
to put all the <hi>Paſſions</hi> of a Man in <hi>arms,</hi> to give open defiance to
any Diſcovery it can make. That great rage and tumult of Kings
and People mentioned in <hi>Pſal. 2. combining</hi> and <hi>taking counſel
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49412:69"/>
againſt the Lord,</hi> and his Laws, is upon the <hi>quarrel</hi> of Intereſt:
their ſuſpitions and jealouſies that the <hi>ſetting up</hi> of Chriſt upon
his Throne would <hi>eclipſe</hi> their power and greatneſs, makes them
(out of a deſperate hatred againſt the Light) fall into reſolves
of open Rebellion againſt his Laws: <hi>Let us break his bands aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and caſt away his cords from us.</hi> This pretence of Intereſt
ſtrengthned the accuſation of <hi>Amaziah</hi> againſt <hi>Amos, Chap. 7. 10.
Amos hath conſpired againſt thee in the midſt of the houſe of Iſrael:
the Land is not able to bear all his words.</hi> No wonder then if <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>
inſtead of hearkning to the threatning, baniſh him out of
the Land. We find the like in <hi>Aſa</hi> (a good man) the Devil ſtirs
up his hatred againſt the Seer,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 16. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>he was wroth with him, and put him
in the Priſon-houſe, for he was in a rage againſt him.</hi> The ground
of that rage was this; the <hi>King's Intereſt</hi> (in his apprehenſion) was
wrapt up in that <hi>League</hi> with the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> verſ. 2, 3. ſo that
he could not bear ſo plain a reproof, which directly laid the Axe
to the Root of ſo great an Intereſt, as the ſafety of the King
and Kingdom, which ſeemed to depend ſo much upon that
League.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Satan ſtirs up hatred againſt the Light from the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
Effects</hi> of Light, which are <hi>diſcovery</hi> and <hi>manifeſtation.</hi>
Epheſ. 5. 13. <hi>All things that are reproved are made manifeſt: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
doth make manifeſt, is Light.</hi> Now the iſſue of this mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
is <hi>ſhame,</hi> which however it be the <hi>daughter</hi> of Sin and
Light, yet would it <hi>naturally deſtroy</hi> the Sin that bred it; and
therefore Repentance is uſually expreſſed by being <hi>aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded:</hi>
but that Satan might avoid this, he turns the edge of
ſhame, againſt the <hi>Light,</hi> which ſhould have been employed againſt
<hi>Sin.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 26.</note> When Men therefore have ſinned, and are <hi>as a Thief when he
is taken,</hi> ready to fall into the hands of ſhame; for the avoiding
of that,<note place="margin">Job 24. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>they rebel againſt the Light.</hi> The ground of this hatred,
Chriſt in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 20 tells us, is, <hi>leſt their deeds ſhould be reproved,</hi> and
they forced to bear their ſhame; to this end they are put upon it
to hide themſelves from ſhame, by lyes, pretences, excuſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuations,
or by any <hi>fig-leaf</hi> that comes firſt to hand. And as
thoſe that live in hotter Regions <hi>curſe the Sun,</hi> becauſe it ſcorcheth
them; ſo do theſe <hi>curſe the Light:</hi> and inſtead of taking its help,
raiſe up an irreconcileable Enmity againſt it; and ſo run from
it.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVI. Of Satan's third grand Policy for maintaining his Poſſeſſion;
which is his feigned Departure. (1.) By ceaſing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of his deſign; and the caſes in which he doth it.
(2.) By abating the eagerneſs of purſuit; and how he doth
that. (3.) By exchanging Temptations; and his Policy
therein. The advantage he ſeeks by ſeeming to fly. Of
his (4.) Stratagem for keeping his Poſſeſſion, which is
his ſtopping all ways of retreat; and how he doth that.</head>
                     <p>BEſides the <hi>two</hi> former Deſigns (of finiſhing Sin, and keeping
all in quiet) by which the Devil endeavours to maintain his
Poſſeſſion, he hath a <hi>third</hi> grand ſubtilty, which is this; <hi>He keeps
his hold by feigning himſelf diſpoſſeſſed and caſt out.</hi> Of this we have
a full account, <hi>Luk. 11. 24. When the unclean Spirit is gone out of
a Man, he walketh thorow dry places, ſeeking reſt: and finding none,
he ſaith, I will return unto my houſe whence I came out.</hi> Chriſt had
there noted that 'tis Satan's great Principle to do nothing by
which his Kingdom may be divided, or undermined. Satan will
not be divided againſt himſelf, and yet very ſeaſonably he tells
us, that for an advantage he will ſeem to quit his Intereſt, and
upon deſign he will ſometimes ſo carry himſelf that he may be
deemed and ſuppoſed to be <hi>gone out of a Man:</hi> As thoſe that beſiege
Forts or walled Towns, do ſometimes raiſe the Siege and feign
a departure, intending thereby to take a ſudden advantage of the
careleſneſs of the beſieged. In the explanation of this Policy, I
ſhall, (1.) Shew how <hi>many ways</hi> he feigns a departure, (2.) <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon
what deſigns</hi> he doth it.</p>
                     <p>There are <hi>three</hi> ways whereby Satan ſeems to forſake his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He frequently <hi>ceaſeth the proſecution</hi> of a Deſign, which
yet he hath in his Eye and Deſire, when he perceives that there
are <hi>ſome things in his way</hi> that render it not <hi>feaſible,</hi> nay he forbears
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49412:70"/>
to urge Men to their <hi>darling</hi> ſins, upon the ſame ſcore: and who
would not think Satan caſt out in ſuch a caſe? When a Man ſpits
out the ſweet Morſel which heretofore he kept under his Tongue,
and ſucked a ſweetneſs from it; when Men of noted Iniquities
abſtain from them, and become ſmooth and civil, who would
not think but that the unclean Spirit were gone? This way and
courſe he puts in practice in ſeveral caſes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When he perceives ſome <hi>extraordinary</hi> occaſion puts any
of his Subjects into a <hi>good mood</hi> or humor of Religion. Wicked
Men are not <hi>ordinarily</hi> ſo highly bent upon evil ways, but that
they may be at ſometimes <hi>ſoftned</hi> and relaxed. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (who is
moſt eminently noted for a heart judicially hardned) at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of the Plagues upon himſelf and <hi>Egypt,</hi> uſually relented
ſomewhat, and would confeſs <hi>he had ſinned,</hi> and that fit would
continue upon him for ſome little time. But very <hi>frequently</hi> 'tis
thus with <hi>others,</hi> an extraordinary occaſion <hi>melts</hi> and thaws down
the natural affections of Men, (as a warm day melts the Snow
upon the Mountains,) and then the ſtream will for a time run
high and ſtrong, at which time Satan ſees 'tis in vain to urge
them. Thus Men that receive an <hi>eminent</hi> kindneſs and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from God, what is more common than for ſuch Men to ſay,
<hi>Oh! we will never be ſo wicked as we have been, we will never be drunk
more, the World ſhall ſee us reformed and new Men:</hi> Theſe are indeed
good words, and yet though Satan knows that ſuch expreſſions
are not from a good heart, (as that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 29. implyes,
<hi>They have well ſaid, O that there were ſuch an heart in them,)</hi> he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
thinks it not fit then to preſs them to their uſual wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
at that time: <hi>for natural affections raiſed high in a profeſſion
of Religion will withſtand Temptations for a fit,</hi> and therefore he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears
till the ſtream run lower. What a fit of affection had the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> when their Eyes had ſeen that miraculous deliverance at
the Red Sea? What Songs of rejoycing had they? what reſolves
never to diſtruſt him again? <hi>Pſal. 106. 12. Then believed they his
words, they ſang his praiſe:</hi> Satan doth not preſently urge them to
murmuring and unbelief, (though that was his deſign) but he
ſtays till the fit was over, and then he could ſoon tempt them to
<hi>forget his works.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 16. &amp; 26. 21.</note> How like a Convert did <hi>Saul</hi> look, after <hi>David</hi>
had convinced him of his integrity, and had ſpared his life in the
Cave? he weeps and acknowledgeth his iniquity, juſtifies <hi>David,</hi>
owns his kindneſs, and ſeems to acquieſce in his ſucceſſion to the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49412:70"/>
Kingdom. The Devil had no queſtion a great ſpite at <hi>David,</hi>
and 'twas his great deſign to ſtir up <hi>Saul</hi> againſt him, and yet at
that time he could not prevail with him to deſtroy <hi>David,</hi> though
he might eaſily have done it; he was then in a <hi>good mood,</hi> and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
was forced to give way to neceſſity, and to ſeem to go out
of <hi>Saul</hi> for the preſent.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He alſo ceaſeth from his deſign when he ſees he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fit his Temptation with a <hi>ſutable opportunity.</hi> What could
be more the Devil's deſign, and <hi>Eſau</hi>'s ſatisfaction, than to have
had <hi>Jacob</hi> ſlain? <hi>Eſau</hi> profeſſeth, it was the deſign of his heart,
and yet he reſolves to forbear ſo long as his Father <hi>Iſaac</hi> lived,
<hi>Gen. 27. 41. The days of my Father's mourning are at hand, then</hi>
(but not till then) <hi>will I ſlay my Brother</hi> Jacob. The Devil often
ſows his ſeed, and yet <hi>waiteth and hath long patience,</hi> not only in
<hi>watering</hi> and fitting the hearts of Men for it, but alſo in <hi>expectancy</hi>
of fit opportunities; and in the mean time, he forbears to put
Men upon that, which time and occaſion cannot fitly bring forth
to practice. The Prophet, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7. 4. ſpeaks of that People, as
notoriouſly wicked, <hi>they are all adulterers;</hi> but withall, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
that they forbare theſe enormous abominations for want
of fit ſeaſons, <hi>their heart was as an Oven heated by the Baker,</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
enflamed after their wickedneſs, and yet the Baker <hi>after he
had kneaded the dough,</hi> prepared all the ground-work of the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<hi>ceaſed from raiſing, ſleeping all the night till all was leavened;</hi>
that is, though their hearts were enraged for Sin, yet the Devil
doth wait till occaſions preſent themſelves, and becomes in the
mean time like one aſleep. Now while the Devil thus ſleeps,
the fire that is ſecretly in the heart, being not ſeen, Men gain the
good <hi>opinion</hi> of <hi>Converts</hi> with others, and often with themſelves,
not knowing what Spirit they are of, becauſe Satan ceaſeth
(upon the want of occaſions) to tempt and provoke them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Our Adverſary is content to forbear, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieves
that a <hi>reſtraining grace</hi> doth <hi>lock up</hi> the hearts and hands of
Men. When <hi>a ſtronger than he cometh,</hi> who can expect leſs but
that he ſhould be more quiet? that God doth reſtrain Men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
when he doth not change them, needs no proof, that Satan
knows of theſe reſtraints, cannot be denyed; who can give an
account of theſe communings and diſcourſes that are betwixt
God and Satan concerning us? his pleadings in reference to <hi>Job,</hi>
were as unknown to <hi>Job</hi> (till God diſcovered them) as his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49412:71"/>
pleadings concerning our ſelves are to us. Beſides, who can tell
how much of God's reſtraining grace may ly in this, of God's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
and ſtraitning Satan's Commiſſion? Now the Devil hath
not ſo badly improved his obſervations, but that he knows 'tis in
vain to tempt where God doth ſtop his way, and tye up Mens
hands. <hi>Abimeleck</hi> was certainly reſolved upon wickedneſs when
he took <hi>Sarah</hi> from <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 20. 2. and yet the matter is
ſo carried for ſome time, (how long we know not,) as if the
Devil had been aſleep or forgot to haſten <hi>Abimeleck</hi> to his intended
wickedneſs; for when God cautions him, <hi>he had not come near her,
verſ.</hi> 4. the ground of all this was neither in the <hi>Devil's backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
nor <hi>Abimeleck's modeſty,</hi> but Satan lets the matter reſt; becauſe
he knew that <hi>God withheld him, and ſuffered him not to touch her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When Men are under the <hi>awe</hi> and fear of ſuch as
carry an <hi>Authority</hi> in their Countenances and Imployments, for the
diſcouraging of Sin. Satan (as hopeleſs to prevail) doth not
ſolicite to ſcandalous Iniquities. Much of external Sanctity, and
Saint-like behaviour ariſeth from hence; the faces and preſence
of ſome Men have ſuch a ſhining <hi>ſplendor,</hi> that Iniquity <hi>bluſheth</hi>
and hideth its head before them. Sin dare not do what it would,
ſo great a reverence and eſteem of ſuch perſons, is kept up in the
conſciences of ſome, and ſo great an awe and fear is thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to others, that they will not, or dare not give way to an
inſolency in evil. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were generally a wicked People,
yet ſuch an awe they had of <hi>Joſhua,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joſ. 2. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>and the Elders that outlived</hi>
Joſhua, <hi>who had ſeen all the great works of the Lord,</hi> that Satan
ſeemed to be caſt out all their days. Who could have thought
<hi>Joaſh</hi> had been ſo much under Satan's power, that had obſerved
his ways all the time of <hi>Je oiada</hi> the Prieſt?<note place="margin">2 Chron. 24. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Then he did that which
was right in the ſight of the Lord;</hi> Satan was content to let him
alone, becauſe <hi>Jehoiada</hi>'s life and authority did overawe him, but
after his death Satan returned to his Poſſeſſion, and <hi>the King
hearkened to the Princes of</hi> Judah,<note place="margin">Verſ. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>and ſerved Groves and Idols.</hi> The
like is obſerved of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cron. 26. 5.</note> the reverence that he had for <hi>Zechariah,</hi>
who had underſtanding in <hi>the viſions of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Verſ. 16.</note> diſcouraged the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
from ſoliciting him to thoſe evils which afterward he engaged
him in: Satan is willing (when he perceives the awe and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of good Men ſtands in his way) rather to ſuſpend the
proſecution of his deſign, than by forcing it againſt ſo ſtrong a
<hi>current</hi> to hazard the <hi>Shipwrack</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:49412:71"/>
Fifthly, He alſo makes as if he were caſt out, when he perceives
the conſciences of Men are <hi>ſcared by threatned or felt judgments;</hi> he
forbears to urge them <hi>againſt the pricks,</hi> when God draws his
Sword, and brings forth the glittering Spear. <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs
would not run againſt the Angel that appeared terribly againſt
him in his way. The Devil knows the power of an <hi>awakened
Conſcience,</hi> and ſees it in vain to ſtrive againſt ſuch a ſtream; and
when it will be no better, he withdraws. As great a power as
the Devil had in <hi>Ahab,</hi> when he was affrighted and <hi>humbled,</hi> he
gave way, and for that ſeaſon drave him not on to his wonted
practice of wickedneſs. He alſo carried thus to the <hi>Ninevites,</hi>
when they were awaked by the preaching of <hi>Jonah,</hi> then we ſee
them a <hi>reforming</hi> People, the Devil ſurceaſed to carry them into
their former provocations. How frequently is this ſeen among
Profeſſors, where the Word hath a ſearching power and force
upon them? Sin is ſo curbed and kept under that 'tis like a
root of bitterneſs in Winter,<note place="margin">Heb. 12 15.</note> lying hid under ground, Satan for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
to act upon it or to improve it, till the ſtorms and noiſe
of Judgments ceaſe, and then uſually it will <hi>ſpring up and trouble
them.</hi> If Satan hath <hi>really loſt his hold,</hi> he ceaſeth not to <hi>moleſt</hi>
and vex even awakened conſciences, with urgent ſolicitations
to Sin; but if he perceive that his <hi>Intereſt</hi> in the hearts of Men
remains <hi>ſure</hi> to him and unſhaken, then (in caſe of afrightment
and fear of wrath) 'tis his policy to conceal himſelf, and to
diſſemble a departure.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Satan is alſo forced to this, by the prevailing <hi>power of
Knowledg and principles of Light,</hi> where the Goſpel in profeſſion,
and preaching, diſplays abroad his bright beams, then whatever
ſhift Men make to be wicked in ſecret, yet <hi>the light is as the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of death to them,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 12.</note> and 'tis even <hi>a ſhame to ſpeak of theſe things in
publick.</hi> Here Satan cannot rage ſo freely, but is put to his ſhifts,
and is forced to be ſilent, whilſt the power of the Goſpel cuts
off <hi>half his garments.</hi> Men begin to reform, ſome are <hi>clean eſcaped
from errour,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 18. others abandon their filthy luſts and
ſcandalous ſins, and ſo <hi>eſcape the pollutions of the World through the
knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ver. 20. Yet under
all theſe great alterations and appearances of amendment, the
Devil is but ſeemingly ejected; for in the place mentioned, when
the Light declines, thoſe that were <hi>eſcaped from Errour,</hi> and thoſe
that had fled from ſinful Pollutions were both <hi>entangled again</hi>
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:49412:72"/>
and carried to the ſame pitch, (and a great deal further) of that
Sin and Errour in which they had been formerly engaged.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Six Caſes in which Satan ceaſeth the Proſecution
of his Deſign; which was his firſt Policy in feigning himſelf to be
caſt out, but he further diſſembles a flight, when he thinks it not
fit to ceaſe wholly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By abating his Purſuit,</hi> by ſlacking his Courſe: and this he
doth,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When he Tempts ſtill, but yet <hi>leſs than formerly;</hi> ſo great
is his cunning and patience, that when he cannot get what he
would have, he contents himſelf with what he can get, rather
than loſe all. He deſires, that Men would give up themſelves fully
and freely to his ſervice: but if they like not this, he is willing
to take them (as one ſpeaks) as <hi>retainers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Greenhams</hi> Works p. 793.</note> and to ſuffer them to
take a liberty, to come and go at pleaſure. He hath <hi>two</hi> main
ends in tempting Men to Sin, one is to <hi>avenge</hi> himſelf <hi>upon God</hi>
in open defiance and diſhonour of his Name; the other is the
<hi>ruine</hi> and perdition <hi>of Souls:</hi> if he could, he would have theſe
two ends meet in every Temptation; yet he pleaſeth himſelf
with the latter, when he cannot help it, and in that too, he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies
himſelf ſometimes with as ſmall an Intereſt as may be, ſo
that his Poſſeſſion and Intereſt be but preſerved. He knows that
<hi>one</hi> Sin, loved and embraced, brings <hi>Death</hi> for its <hi>Wages.</hi> A <hi>leak</hi>
unſtopped and neglected may ſink the Ship as well as a great
Storm; and therefore when he perceives the Conſciences of
Men ſhie and nice, he is willing they <hi>come to him</hi> (as <hi>Nicodemus</hi>
came to Chriſt) <hi>by night</hi> in private, and that by ſtealth they do
him ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He ſometimes offers Men a <hi>Compoſition,</hi> and ſo keeps
his hold <hi>privately,</hi> by giving them an <hi>Indulgence</hi> and Tolleration,
to comply with <hi>Religious duties</hi> and obſervations. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended,
that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould go and ſerve the Lord in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
upon condition, that their Wives Children and Subſtance
were left behind: ſo Satan ſaith to ſome, <hi>Go and ſerve the Lord,
only let your heart be with me, leave your Affections behind upon the
World.</hi> That ſerious warning of Chriſt, <hi>Ye cannot ſerve two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;
ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> evidently ſhews, that the
Devil uſeth to <hi>conceal</hi> his Intereſt in the hearts of Sinners, by
offering <hi>ſuch</hi> terms; and that Men are ſo apt to think, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
is gone out, when they have <hi>ſhared</hi> the heart betwixt <hi>God</hi>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:49412:72"/>
and <hi>him;</hi> that they ſtand in need of a full diſcovery of that Cheat,
and earneſt caution againſt it: the Devil was forced to yield,
that <hi>Herod</hi> ſhould do many things at the Preaching of <hi>John,</hi> yet
he maintained his poſſeſſion of his heart, by fixing him in his
reſolved Luſt, in the matter of <hi>Herodias:</hi> and this gives juſt
ground of complaint againſt the generality of Sinners; <hi>Ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
but not to me, not with your whole hearts: have ye faſted to me?
have ye mourned to me? they come and ſit as my people, but their hearts
are after their covetouſneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Satan hath yet another wile by which he would cheat
men into a belief, that he is caſt out of the heart; and this is
a ſubtile way that he hath to <hi>exchange Temptations.</hi> How weak
and childiſh are Sinners that ſuffer themſelves thus to be abuſed?
When they grow ſick and weary of a Sin, if the Devil take that
from them, and lay in the room of it another as bad, or the ſame
again, only a little changed and altered; they pleaſe themſelves
that they have vomited up the firſt, but conſider not, that they
have received into their embracement another as bad, or worſe.
Concerning this exchange, we may note two things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That ſometimes he atteins his end, by exchanging <hi>one hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Sin</hi> for <hi>another</hi> as hainous, only not ſo much <hi>out of faſhion.</hi>
As the cuſtoms, and times, and places give laws and rules for Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
according to which, the decencies, or indecencies of Garbs
and Garments are determined: ſo is it ſometimes with Sin, Men
and Countries have their <hi>darling</hi> Sins; Times and Ages alſo
have their <hi>peculiar</hi> Iniquities, which (in the judgment of Sinners)
do cloath them with a fitneſs, and ſuitableneſs. Sometimes Men
grow weary of Sins, becauſe they are every where ſpoken againſt;
becauſe Men point at them with the finger, the Devil in this
caſe is ready to change with them. Drunkenneſs hath in ſome
Ages and Places carried a brand of Infamy in its forehead; ſo
hath Uncleanneſs and other Sins: when Sinners cannot practiſe
theſe with credit and reputation, then they pleaſe themſelves
with an alteration: he that was a Drunkard, is now it may be
grown ambitious and boaſting: he that was Covetous, is become
a prodigal or profuſe Waſter; the heart is as vain and ſottiſh as
before, only their Luſts are let out another way, and run in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
channel. Sometimes Luſts are changed alſo, with the change
of <hi>Mens condition</hi> in the World; Poverty, and Plenty, a private,
and a publick Station have their peculiar Sins: he that of poor
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49412:73"/>
is made rich, leaves his Sins of Diſtruſt, Envy, or Deceitful
Dealing, and follows the Byas of his preſent ſtate to other wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes
equally remarkable; and yet may be ſo blinded as to
apprehend, that Satan is departed from him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We may obſerve, that Satan exchangeth Sins with
Men, in ſuch a ſecret <hi>private manner,</hi> that the change is not eaſily
<hi>diſcovered;</hi> and by this ſhift he caſts a greater miſt before the
Eyes of Men: thus he exchanged open Prophaneſs, into ſecret
Sins: <hi>Filthineſs of the fleſh,</hi> into <hi>filthineſs of the Spirit.</hi> Men
ſeem to reform their groſs Impieties, abſtaining from Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Swearing, Adulteries, and then (it may be) they are taken
up with <hi>Spiritual pride,</hi> and their hearts are puffed up with high
conceits of themſelves, their gifts and attainments; or they are
entangled with error, and ſpend their time in <hi>doting about Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that engender ſtrife rather than edifying;</hi> or they are taken up
with <hi>Hypocriſies:</hi> thus the Phariſees left their open iniquities, <hi>waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the out-ſide of the Cup and Platter;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 26.</note> and inſtead of theſe,
indeavoured to varniſh and paint themſelves over;<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 44.</note> ſo that in all
this change, they were but as <hi>Graves that appeared not.</hi> Or they
acquieſs in <hi>Formality,</hi> and the outwards of Religion; like that
proud Boaſter, <hi>Lord, I thank thee I am not as other Men are,</hi> &amp;c.
In all theſe things the Devil ſeems caſt out, and Men reformed,
when indeed he may continue his Poſſeſſion; only he lurks, and
<hi>hides himſelf under the ſtuff.</hi> Theſe wayes of Sinning are but
<hi>finer poyſons,</hi> which, though not ſo <hi>nauſeous</hi> to the ſtomack, nor ſo
<hi>quick</hi> in their diſpatch, yet may be as ſurely and <hi>certainly deadly;</hi>
ſuch fly from the <hi>Iron Weapon,</hi> and <hi>a Bow of Steel ſtrikes them
through.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus explained the three wayes by which Satan pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to depart from Men, I muſt next ſhew his Deſign in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſuch a pretence of forſaking his Habitation.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That all this is done by him only <hi>upon Defign,</hi> may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concluded from ſeveral things hinted to us in the fore-cited
place of <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. As (1) he doth not ſay, that the Devil
is <hi>caſt out,</hi> as if there were a force upon him, but that he <hi>goeth out,</hi>
'tis of choice, a voluntary departure. (2) That his going out
(in this ſenſe) is notwithſtanding <hi>irkeſome</hi> and troubleſome to him.
The Heart of Man (as one obſerves) is a <hi>Palace</hi> in his eſtimation,
and diſpoſſeſſion (though upon Deſign) is as a <hi>Deſart</hi> to him that
affords him little eaſe or reſt.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Greenham,</hi> p. 796.</note> (3) That his going out, is not a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49412:73"/>
quitting of his Intereſt, he calls it <hi>his Houſe</hi> ſtill, <hi>I will return to my
houſe,</hi> ſaith he. (4) He takes care in going out to lock the door,
that it may not be taken up with better Gueſts; he keeps it <hi>empty</hi>
and tenantable for himſelf: he tempts ſtill, though not ſo viſibly,
and ſtrives to ſuppreſs ſuch good Thoughts and Motions as he
fears may quite out him of his Poſſeſſion. (5) He goes out, <hi>cum
animo revertendi,</hi> with a purpoſe of returning. (6) His Seceſſion
is ſo dexterouſly and advantagiouſly managed, that he finds an
eaſie admittance at his return; and his Poſſeſſion confirmed and
enlarged: <hi>They enter in, and dwell there.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The advantages that he deſignes by this Policy
are theſe chiefly. (1) By this means Men are dangerouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in their <hi>ſecurities.</hi> Thus the <hi>Phariſee</hi> bleſſed himſelf, <hi>Lord,
I thank thee,</hi> &amp;c. They pleaſe themſelves with this ſuppoſition,
that the Devil is caſt out; and upon this, they ceaſe their War
and Watchfulneſs. As <hi>Saul</hi> when he heard that <hi>David</hi> had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped,
<hi>went not out to ſeek after him:</hi> ſo theſe trouble not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
any further to enquire Satan's haunts in their Hearts; thus
he ſits ſecurely within, whilſt they think he is fled from them.
(2) By this means alſo he fits Men as Inſtruments <hi>to ſerve his turn</hi>
in <hi>other works</hi> of his: he muſt have in ſome caſes, <hi>handſom tools</hi>
to work withal; all Men are not fit Agents in <hi>Perſecution,</hi> either
to credit it, or to carry it through with vigour and zeal: for this
end he ſeems to go out of ſome, that under a ſmoother and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion-like</hi>
behaviour, (when they are ſtirred up to Perſecute)
the rigour might ſeem juſt.<note place="margin">Acts 13. 50.</note> Thus <hi>devout and honourable Women</hi>
were ſtirred up to Perſecute <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> the Devil had
gone out ſo far, that they had gained the reputation of <hi>devout,</hi>
and then their Zeal would eaſily take fire for Perſecution, and
withal put a reſpect and credit upon it: for who would readily
ſuſpect that to be Evil, or Satan's Deſign, which is carryed on
by ſuch Inſtruments? Beſides, if he at any time intends to
<hi>blemiſh</hi> the good ways of God by the miſcarriages of Profeſſors,
he fetcheth his Arrow out of this Quiver uſually; if he brings
a <hi>refined Hypocrite</hi> to a ſcandalous Sin, then doth the Mouth
of Wickedneſs open it ſelf to blaſpheme <hi>the Generation of the
Juſt,</hi> as if none were better: ſuch Agents could not be ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
at hand for ſuch a Service, if Satan did not in the
wayes aforementioned ſeem to go out of Men. (3) 'Tis ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of his Deſign after a pretended departure, to take
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49412:74"/>
the advantage of their <hi>ſecurity,</hi> to return with <hi>greater</hi> ſtrength and
force:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 20.</note> this Chriſt particularly notes, <hi>Then taketh he ſeven Spirits
worſe than himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Such (as <hi>Peter</hi> tells us) being <hi>again entangled,</hi>
are totally <hi>overcome, and their latter end is worſe with them than their
beginning.</hi> How many might I name, (if it were convenient) that
I have known and obſerved exactly, anſwering this deſcription
of the Apoſtle, that have for ſome years left off their wicked ways,
and engaged for a profeſſion of Religion; and yet at laſt <hi>have
returned like the dog to his own vomit again?</hi> The Devil, when he
fights after the <hi>Parthian</hi> manner,<note place="margin">Terga verten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes metuendi Parthi.</note> is moſt to be feared; when he
turns his back, he ſhoots moſt envenomed Arrows, and whom
he ſo wounds, he commonly wounds them to the Death.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth and laſt Stratagem of Satan for the keeping his
Poſſeſſion, is to <hi>ſtop the Way;</hi> to <hi>barracado</hi> up all Paſſages, that
there may be no poſſibility of eſcape, or retreat: when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
that his former wayes of Policy are not ſufficient, but
that his Slaves and Servants are ſo far inlightned in the diſcovery
of the danger, that they are ready to turn back from him; then
he beſtirs himſelf to oppoſe their revolt:<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 6.</note> and as God ſometimes
<hi>hedgeth up the way</hi> of Sinners with <hi>thorns,</hi> that they ſhould not
follow their old Lovers, ſo doth Satan; to which purpoſe,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, He endeavours to turn them off ſuch reſolutions, by
threatning to</hi> reduce <hi>them with a</hi> ſtrong hand: <hi>here he boaſts and
vaunts of his Power, and Sinners weakneſs; as</hi> Rabſhekah <hi>did
againſt</hi> Hezekiah, What is that confidence wherein thou truſteſt? have
the Gods of <hi>Hamath</hi> and <hi>Arpad,</hi> &amp;c. delivered their Land out of
my hand? Have thoſe that have gone before you been able to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from me? Have they been able to reſcue themſelves? Did I not
force thoſe that were ſtronger than you? Did I not make <hi>David</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the People? Did I not overcome him in the matter of <hi>Uriah?</hi> Did
I not compel <hi>Peter</hi> to deny his Lord, notwithſtanding his ſolemn profeſſion
to the contrary? And can you think to break away from me ſo eaſily?
<hi>By this means he would weaken their heart, and enfeeble their
Reſolutions, that they might ſit down under their Bondage, as
hopeleſs ever to</hi> recover themſelves <hi>from his</hi> ſnare; <hi>but if theſe
affrightments hinder not, if notwithſtanding theſe brags, Sinners
prepare themſelves to turn from Sin to God: then,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, He <hi>improves all he can, that diſtance which Sin hath made
betwixt God and them.</hi> Sins of ordinary infirmity and common
incurſion do not ſo break the peace of God's Children, as Sins of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49412:74"/>
an higher nature do: even in the Saints themſelves, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
after notorious tranſgreſſion, (1) That the <hi>acquaintance</hi>
and familiarity 'twixt God and them, is <hi>immediately broken;</hi> what
a ſpeedy alteration is made? How ſuddenly are all things chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged?
God hides himſelf; the Sun that <hi>ſhined</hi> but now, and did
afford a very comfortable and cheriſhing heat, before we are aware,
is now hid in <hi>a cloud;</hi> our warmth and refreſhments are turned
into cold and chilneſs. There is alſo a change <hi>on our part,</hi> and
that ſuddenly; as in the Reſurrection, we ſhall be changed <hi>in
the twinkling of an eye:</hi> ſo here in a <hi>moment,</hi> our joyes flag and
decay, our delights grow dull, our activity is impaired, we are
bound and frozen up, and 'tis altogether Winter with the Soul.
(2) It may be noted, that this <hi>begets an eſtrangement</hi> in us, and
we ſo carry it, as if we had reſolved not to renew our League with
God: for though we are not altogether ſo deſperate as to make
<hi>formal Reſolutions</hi> of continuing in Sin, of caſting off God, and
bidding an everlaſting farewel to our former acquaintance; though
we do not ſay, we will now undoe our ſelves quite, and harden
our ſelves in our Rebellion; yet Sin hath left us in ſuch a maze,
and filled us with ſo many damps and miſgiving thoughts, that
we <hi>do not think of returning,</hi> we are at a ſtand, and <hi>like a mighty
man aſtoniſhed that cannot find his hands:</hi> we perceive we have loſt
ſo much, and have run into ſuch great unkindneſſes, that, like
broken Merchants, nothing is more irkſome and tedious, than
to <hi>review</hi> our ways, or look into <hi>our debt-books;</hi> inſtead of this, we
endeavour to divert our thoughts, to caſt off care, as if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that <hi>time</hi> would eat it out, and that then <hi>of courſe</hi> we
might fall into the old channel of freedom and comfort.
(3) When we return at laſt, oh! with what baſhfulneſs and amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
do we appear at our next Supplications; what bluſhing,
what damps, what apology? Nay ſometimes as the Man without
the Wedding Garment, <hi>we are ſpeechleſs;</hi> how rightly doth ſuch
a Man reſemble the <hi>Publican</hi> Confeſſing, and the <hi>Prodigal</hi> ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating,
while conſulting what to ſay for himſelf, he now begins
to feel, with what ſenſe and feeling the Prophets and holy Men
of old uſed to expreſs themſelves in their Confeſſions; <hi>We bluſh,
we are aſhamed, aſtoniſhed and confounded.</hi> This diſtance Sin makes
betwixt <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>God</hi> ſometimes; but betwixt <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted</hi>
it is far greater: now, when either an unconverted Sinner,
or a fallen Saint puts himſelf to look to God for Reconciliation,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49412:75"/>
then doth the Devil labour to improve this for their hindrance:<note place="margin">Zech. 3. 1.</note>
that he accuſeth us <hi>to God,</hi> is evident by <hi>Satans ſtanding at</hi> Joſhua<hi>'s
right hand;</hi> how he accuſeth <hi>God to us</hi> we know. He tells us, 'tis
in vain to ſeek to make up our Peace after ſo great Provocations;
urging, that he is a <hi>jealous God, of pure eyes:</hi> highly reſenting the
affronts we have given him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, he goes ſo high this way,
that God is put to it in Scripture (of purpoſe to furniſh us with
an Anſwer to theſe Objections) to proclaim, that he is <hi>ſlow to
anger,</hi> not <hi>eaſily provoked:</hi> that if Men return from the evil of their
ways, he will <hi>return to them, accept,</hi> and <hi>pity</hi> them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If this divert them not, but that they ſtill perſiſt in
their reſolves, then he follows after them with an high hand;
ſometimes, (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did with <hi>Iſrael)</hi> he grows <hi>ſevere</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
with them, and redoubles the <hi>tale of their bricks;</hi> he force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them to higher and more frequent iniquities: ſometimes (as
the ſame <hi>Pharaoh)</hi> he muſters up all his Chariots and Horſe-men
to <hi>purſue</hi> after them, and in the higheſt diligence imaginable, he
brings forth his greateſt power, beſetting them on all ſides with
Temptations and <hi>Allurements</hi> of Pleaſures and Delight: Where he
perceives his <hi>time</hi> to be <hi>ſhort,</hi> and his Power ſhaken, he comes down
in reſolves to try his utmoſt Strength. And hence is it that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
complain, that when they <hi>begin</hi> in earneſt to look after God,
they are <hi>moſt troubled</hi> with Temptations. Beſides this, what ever
he can do to make them <hi>drive heavily,</hi> ſhall not be wanting.
Sometimes he makes attempts upon their <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi>
which are as their <hi>Chariot wheels;</hi> and if theſe can be <hi>knocked off</hi>
any way, it retards them. Sometimes he caſts <hi>ſtumbling-blocks</hi>
in their way; if any prejudice may divert them, if Threatnings
or Penalties can hinder; if the frowning of Friends, or any thing
elſe can put a ſtop to their Proceedings, he will have them ready.
Sometimes he endeavours to <hi>retard</hi> them by <hi>ſollicitations</hi> of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
<hi>offers</hi> of former occaſions and opportunities of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or what ever elſe may be as a <hi>remora</hi> to their intentions.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, But if none of theſe ſerve, then as his laſt ſhift, he
<hi>proclaims open War againſt them,</hi> purſues them as <hi>Enemies</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels:
now he begins to <hi>accuſe</hi> them, for that which they did by
<hi>his Advice</hi> and Temptation. Now Sins that were called <hi>little</hi> are
<hi>aggravated.</hi> Now that <hi>day of Repentance,</hi> which he was wont to
ſay was <hi>long,</hi> he tells them 'tis quite <hi>ſpent,</hi> that the Sun of their
hope is ſet; nothing now doth he ſuggeſt but Hell, Damnation,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49412:75"/>
and Wrath; he makes them (as it were) ſee it, hear it, and
feel it in every thing; that <hi>intereſt</hi> in their hearts which he <hi>diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi>
before, now he ſtands upon and <hi>aſſerts,</hi> and will not be beat
off, deſigning in all this, either to make them <hi>weary</hi> of theſe <hi>new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves</hi>
by this unuſual diſquietment, and hoſtility, or to <hi>precipitate</hi>
them upon ſome <hi>deſperate</hi> undertaking, or at leaſt to <hi>avenge</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon them, in venting his Malice and Rage againſt them;
but of this more afterward.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVII. Satan's Deceits againſt Religious Services and Duties.
The Grounds of his diſpleaſure againſt Religious Duties.
His firſt deſign againſt Duties, is to prevent them. His
ſeveral ſubtilties for that end, by exernal hindrances, by
indiſpoſitions, bodily and ſpiritual, by diſcouragements;
the ways thereof, by diſlike; the grounds thereof; by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical
arguings. His various pleas therein.</head>
                     <p>OUr next work is to take notice of the ſpite and methods of
the Serpent againſt the ways of <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Service,</hi> that
theſe are things againſt which his heart carries an high fury, and
for the overthrow of them imploys no ſmall part of his Power
and Subtilty: needs no proof, ſeeing the experience of all the
Children of God is an irreſiſtible evidence in this matter. I ſhall
therefore firſt only ſet forth the grounds of his diſpleaſure, and
earneſt undertakings againſt them (before I come to his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ways of Deceit) which are theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By this means (if he prevail) he deprives us of our
<hi>Weapons.</hi> This is a ſtratagem of War which we find the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims</hi>
practiſed againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 13. 19. 12.</note> they took away all <hi>their Smiths, leſt
the</hi> Hebrews <hi>ſhould make them Swords or Spears:</hi> hence was it that
in the Battel there was <hi>neither Sword nor Spear found in the hand of
any of the People that were with</hi> Saul <hi>and</hi> Jonathan. The Word of
God is expreſsly called <hi>the Sword of the Spirit;</hi> Prayer is as a Spear,
or rather a general piece of Armour: if the Devil deprive us of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49412:76"/>
theſe, he robs us of our <hi>Ammunition;</hi> for by reaſon of theſe, the
Church is compared to <hi>a Tower built for an Armory,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cart. 4. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>wherein hang a
thouſand Bucklers, all Shields of mighty Men;</hi> and the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly
calls them <hi>Weapons of our Warfare,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4.</note> of purpoſe given us,
for <hi>the pulling down of ſtrong Holds,</hi> and the demoliſhing of thoſe
Forts and Batteries of <hi>high Imaginations</hi> that Satan rears up in the
hearts of Men againſt their happineſs; if theſe be taken away,
our <hi>Locks</hi> are cut, (as <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s were) our Strength is departed,
and we become weak as other Men, we are open to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion
and inroad that he pleaſeth to make againſt us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If he hinders theſe, he intercepts <hi>our Food</hi> and cuts
off our Proviſions. The Word is called <hi>Milk, ſincere Milk of the
Word;</hi> 'tis that by which we are born, nouriſhed, and increaſe;
'tis our Cordial and Comfort; Chriſt indeed is <hi>the Bread of Life,</hi>
and the <hi>fountain</hi> of all our Conſolations, but the Word and
Prayer are the <hi>Conduit Pipes</hi> that convey all to us; if theſe be cut,
we <hi>fade as a Leaf,</hi> we languiſh, we conſume and waſte, we become
as a <hi>Skin, Bottle in the Smoak, our moiſture as the drought in Summer,</hi>
our <hi>Soul fainteth, our Heart faileth</hi> and <hi>we become as thoſe that go
down to the Pit;</hi> ſo that if the Devil gain his deſign in this, he hath
all; give him <hi>this,</hi> and give him the <hi>Kingdom alſo;</hi> this is the moſt
<hi>compendious</hi> way of doing his work, and that which ſaves him a
labour in his Temptations. The ſtrongeſt Holds (that cannot
otherwiſe be taken) are eaſily ſubdued by Famine; and, like Fig-trees
with their ripe Figs when they are ſhaken, <hi>even fall into the
mouth of the eater:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Nahum 3. 12.</note> if our Spiritual Food fail us, of <hi>our own accord</hi> we
yield up our ſelves to any luſt that requires our complyance.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Beſides theſe, there is no deſign whereby Satan can
ſhew <hi>more malice</hi> and ſpite <hi>againſt God.</hi> He doth all he can to
maintain a <hi>competition</hi> with the Almighty: his Titles, of the <hi>God
of the World, the Prince of the power of the Air,</hi> ſhew what in the
pride of his heart he aſpires to, as well as what by commiſſion God
is pleaſed to grant him. Theſe duties of Worſhip and Service
are the <hi>homage</hi> of God's Children, by which they teſtify the <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments</hi>
of his <hi>Deity;</hi> by wreſting theſe out of our hands, Satan
robs God of that honour, and makes the allegiance of his Servants
to ceaſe; if he could do more againſt God, doubtleſs he would:
but ſeeing he hath not an <hi>Arm like God,</hi> and ſo cannot pull him out
of Heaven, by this means he ſets up himſelf as the God of the
World, and enlargeth his Territories, and ſtaves off the Subjects
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49412:76"/>
of the God of Heaven from giving him <hi>the honour due to his Name;</hi>
and that the Devil in theſe endeavours is carried on by a ſpite
againſt God, as well as by an earneſt deſire of the ruine of Souls,
may be abundantly evidenced, by his way of management of that
oppoſition that he gives to the duties of Service and Worſhip.
I ſhall only to make this out, inſtance in three things: (1.) That
where the Devil prevails to ſet up himſelf as an <hi>Object</hi> of Worſhip,
there he doth it in a bold inſolent preſumptuous <hi>imitation</hi> of God's
<hi>Appointments</hi> in the ways of his Service; he enjoyns Covenants,
Seals, Sacrifices, Prayers and Services to his miſerable Slaves, as
may appear by undoubted Hiſtories, of which more in due place.
(2.) He never <hi>acknowledgeth</hi> the truth of God's ways, but with
an <hi>evil mind,</hi> and upon deſign to bring them under contempt;
his <hi>Confeſſions</hi> have ſo much of deceit in them that Chriſt would
not accept them; and therefore we read that when the Devil was
ſometime forward to give his teſtimony to Chriſt, (as <hi>Mark 1. 25.
I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God,) Jeſus</hi> rebuked him,
and <hi>commanded him to hold his peace;</hi> he clearly ſaw that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
him, not to honour him, but by ſuch a particular acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
to <hi>ſtir</hi> up the <hi>rage</hi> and fury of the People againſt him.
To this end Satan, in <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 17. many days together publickly
owns <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Theſe Men are the ſervants of the moſt high God,
which ſhew unto us the way of Salvation:</hi> though he ſpake truth,
yet had he a <hi>malicious aim</hi> in it, which he accordingly brought
about by this means, and that was to raiſe up perſecution againſt
them, and to give ground to that accuſation which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
met withall, <hi>verſ. 21. That they taught cuſtoms which were
not lawful to be received.</hi> But (3.) His particular ſpite againſt
God in ſeeking to undermine his Service is further manifeſted in
this, That the Devil is not content to <hi>root out</hi> the ſervice due to
God, but when he hath done that, he delights to <hi>abuſe</hi> thoſe places
where the Name of God was moſt celebrated, with greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanations.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Syntag.</hi> Part 1.</note> I ſhall not in this inſiſt upon the conjecture of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Diſput. 2.</note> that <hi>Sylva Dodonaea,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Theſſ. 20. 21, 22.</note> a place highly abuſed by the Devil, and
reſpected for an Oracle, was the ſeat, or a <hi>religious place</hi> of <hi>Doda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim,</hi>
mentioned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 4. nor upon that ſuppoſal, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
alſo by the ſame Author, that the Oracle of <hi>Jupiter Hammon</hi>
was the place where <hi>Cham</hi> practiſed that religious worſhip which
he learned in his Fathers houſe. We have at hand more certain
evidences of the Devils ſpite. Such was his abuſe of the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle</hi>
                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:49412:77"/>
by the prophane ſons of <hi>Eli,</hi> who prophaned that place with
their uncleanneſs and filthy adulteries. Such was his carriage to
the <hi>Ark</hi> while it was captivated by the <hi>Philiſtims.</hi> Of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
were his attempts againſt the <hi>Temple</hi> it ſelf. <hi>Solomon</hi> in his
latter days was tempted to give an affront to it, he built an high
place for <hi>Chemoſh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>the Abomination of</hi> Moab, <hi>in the hill that is before</hi>
Jeruſalem, in the very ſight and face of the Temple; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
he prevailed to defile the Temple it ſelf. <hi>Gilgal</hi> and <hi>Beth-aven</hi>
are places of ſuch high prophanation, that the Prophet <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9. 15.
tells them <hi>all their wickedneſs</hi> was <hi>in Gilgal,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Arrowſmith Tract. Sacr.</hi> l. 1. c. 5. §. 9.</note> none of their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
were like to thoſe; and in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 15. they are dehorted
from going to <hi>Gilgal</hi> or <hi>Bethaven,</hi> and yet both theſe places had
been famous for Religion before. <hi>Gilgal</hi> was the place of the
<hi>general Circumciſion</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were born in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
there was their <hi>firſt ſolemn Paſſover</hi> kept after their entring
into the Land. <hi>Bethel</hi> was a place where God (as it were) kept
Houſe, <hi>the houſe of God.</hi> Here <hi>Jacob</hi> had his viſion. But the more
famous they had been for duties of Worſhip, the Devil ſought
to put higher abuſes upon them; ſo that <hi>Gilgal</hi> became <hi>on Hatred,</hi>
and <hi>Bethel</hi> became a <hi>Beth-aven,</hi> an houſe of Vanity.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Satan is the more animated to undertake a deſign againſt
the ways of religious Service, becauſe he <hi>ſeldom</hi> or never <hi>miſſeth,</hi>
at leaſt ſomething of <hi>ſucceſs.</hi> This attempt is like <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi>'s
Bow, that <hi>returned not empty.</hi> In other Temptations
ſometimes Satan comes off baſfled altogether, but in this work
(as 'twas ſaid of ſome <hi>Iſraelites) he can throw a ſtone at an hairs
breadth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Judg. 20. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>and not miſs:</hi> he is ſure in one thing or other to have the
better of us; his advantage in this caſe is from <hi>our unſutableneſs</hi> to
our ſervice. What we do in the duties of Worſhip requires a <hi>choice</hi>
frame of Spirit; our hearts ſhould be awed with the moſt <hi>ſerious
apprehenſions</hi> of divine Majeſty, filled <hi>with Reverence,</hi> animated
<hi>with Love</hi> and delight, quickned <hi>by Faith,</hi> clothed <hi>with Humility</hi>
and <hi>ſelf-abhorrency,</hi> and in all the procedure of duties there muſt
be a ſteady and firm proſecution under the ſtricteſt <hi>watchfulneſs.</hi>
Of this nature is our work, which at the firſt view would put a
Man to a ſtand, and out of amazement force him to ſay, <hi>who is
ſufficient for theſe things? who can ſtand before ſuch an holy Lord God?</hi>
But when we come to an impartial conſideration of our manifold
weakneſſes and inſufficiences in reference to theſe Services, what
ſhall we ſay? we find ſuch a <hi>narrowneſs</hi> of Spirit, ſuch <hi>ignorances,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49412:77"/>
ſottiſhneſs, careleſneſs</hi> of Mind, Thoughts ſo <hi>confuſed, tumultuous,
fickle, ſlippery,</hi> and <hi>unconſtant,</hi> and our hearts generally ſo <hi>deceitful</hi>
and <hi>deſperately wicked,</hi> that 'tis not poſſible that Satan ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
labour in vain, or catch nothing; this being then a ſure
gain, we may expect it to be under a moſt conſtant practice.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, If he ſo prevails againſt us that the ſervices of Worſhip
become <hi>groſly abuſed</hi> or <hi>neglected,</hi> then doth he put us under the
<hi>greateſt hazards</hi> and diſadvantages. Nothing <hi>ſo poyſonous</hi> as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Worſhip <hi>corrupted;</hi> for this is to abuſe God <hi>to his face:</hi> by
this, not only are his Commands and Injunctions ſlighted as in
other ſins, but we carry it ſo, as if we thought him no better than
the <hi>Idols of the Heathens,</hi> that have <hi>Eyes and ſee not, that have Ears
and hear not.</hi> To come <hi>without</hi> an Heart, or <hi>with our Idols in our
Heart,</hi> is it any thing of leſs ſcorn than to ſay, <hi>Tuſh, doth the moſt
High ſee?</hi> Beſides, he hath given ſuch ſevere Cautions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
in theſe matters, as will eaſily ſignify the aggravation of
the offence. You ſee how ſharply God ſpeaks of thoſe that came
to enquire of the Lord, with the <hi>ſtumbling-block of their iniquity
before their face,</hi> Ezek. 14. 4, 7. <hi>I will anſwer them according to the
multitude of their Idols, I will anſwer them by my ſelf. Saul</hi>'s miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
in offering Sacrifice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 13. was that great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
for which God determined to take the Kingdom from him.
God's ſeverity againſt <hi>Nadah</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> his ſtroke upon <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi>
do all ſhew the hazard of ſuch prophanations. But above all,
that danger which both <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſpeak of, the
<hi>hardning of the Heart, blinding the Eyes, dulling the Ears, that Men
ſhould not hear, nor ſee, nor be converted and ſaved,</hi> but that the Word
ſhould (inſtead of thoſe cordial refreſhing ſmells, which beget
and promote ſpiritual life in the obedient,) breath forth ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed
<hi>poyſonous exhalations,</hi> (when 'tis thus abuſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned)
that it becomes <hi>the ſavour of death unto death,</hi> is moſt
dreadful. No wonder then if Satan be very buſie againſt theſe

it proves ſo deadly and dangerous to us: for what can more pleaſe
him, that makes it his delight and imployment to deſtroy?</p>
                     <p>All theſe Reaſons evince that Satan hath an <hi>aking tooth</hi> againſt
religious Services, and that to weaken, prevent, or overthrow
them is his great endeavour. Here then eſpecially may we expect
an aſſault according to the advice of <hi>Sirach,</hi>

                     <p>What are the Subtilties of Satan againſt the holy things of God,
I am next to diſcover. Duties and Services are oppoſed two
ways.<note place="margin">Duties oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed two ways.</note> (1.) By <hi>Prevention,</hi> when they are hindred. (2.) By
<hi>Corruption,</hi> when they are ſpoiled. He hath his Arts and Cunning,
which he exerciſeth in both theſe regards.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then,<note place="margin">1. By Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and that</note> Of Satan's Policy for the preventing of religious
Services, he endeavous by various means to hinder them. As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By <hi>External hindrances.</hi> In this he hath a very great
foreſight,<note place="margin">1. By Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> and accordingly he foreſees Occaſions and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
at <hi>a diſtance,</hi> and by a long reach of contrivance, he ſtudies
to lay <hi>Blocks</hi> and Hindrances in the way. Much he doth in the
<hi>dark</hi> for this end, that we know not. As God hath <hi>ſecrets of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that are double to that which is known,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job. 11. 6.</note> ſo alſo hath Satan many
ways and actings that are not diſcerned by us; his <hi>contrivances of
buſineſſes</hi> and <hi>avocations</hi> long aforehand, are not ſo obſerved by us
as they might be; where he <hi>miſſeth</hi> of his end, it comes <hi>not to
light,</hi> and often where he is <hi>ſucceſsful</hi> in his preventions, we are
ready to aſcibe it to <hi>contingencies,</hi> and the accidental hits of affairs,
when indeed the Hand and <hi>Policy</hi> of Satan is in it. <hi>Paul</hi> that
was highly ſtudied and skilful in Satan's devices, obſerving how
his purpoſes of coming to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were often broken and
obſtructed; he knew where the blame lay, and therefore inſtead
of laying the fault upon <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> or <hi>Impriſonments,</hi> or the <hi>oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of falſe Brethren (which often made him trouble beyond
expectation,) he directly chargeth all upon Satan, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 18.
We would have come unto you</hi> (even I <hi>Paul) once and again, but
Satan hindred us.</hi> At the ſame rate, underſtanding the <hi>purpoſes</hi> of
faithful Men, for the promoting the good of Mens ſouls, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
uſeth means to <hi>ſtop</hi> or hinder them. Some have obſerved
(having a watchful and jealous eye over Satan,) that their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
and Endeavours of this nature have uſually been put to
<hi>ſtruggle</hi> ſore <hi>in their birth,</hi> when their <hi>purpoſes</hi> for <hi>worldly Affairs</hi>
and Matters go <hi>ſmoothly</hi> on without conſiderable oppoſition.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 By Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſitions.</note> He makes uſe of <hi>Indiſpoſitions</hi> to hinder Service: and
here he works ſometimes upon <hi>the Body,</hi> ſometimes upon the
<hi>Soul,</hi> for both may be indiſpoſed.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Bodily Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſitions.</note> Sometimes he takes the advange of <hi>Bodily indiſpoſitions:</hi>
He doth all he can to <hi>create</hi> and frame theſe upon us, and then
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49412:78"/>
pleads them as a <hi>diſcharge</hi> to duty. If he can put the Body into
a fit of drowſineſs or diſtemper, he will do it: and ſurely he can
do more this way than every one will believe, he may agitate
and ſtir the humors. Hence ſome have obſerved more <hi>frequent</hi>
and <hi>ſtronger</hi> fits of ſleepineſs and illneſs to come upon them, on
the <hi>days</hi> and <hi>times</hi> that require their attendance upon God, than
<hi>on other days,</hi> when they ſhall be lively, active, and free of dulneſs
upon common occaſions, at Sports, Songs, Interludes, when
they ſhall not have the like command of themſelves in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
of Worſhip. Surely it was more than an <hi>ordinary drowſineſs</hi>
that befell the Apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 41. He had told them the
<hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> of the occaſion, that he was <hi>betrayed,</hi> that his <hi>ſoul was
exceeding ſorrowful even to the death:</hi> theſe were conſiderations that
might have kept their Eyes from ſlumber. When they ſleep, he
awakens them with a piercing rebuke, <hi>Could ye not watch with me
one hour?</hi> and adds to this an admonition of their own danger,
and the temptation that was upon them, and yet preſently they
are aſleep again, and after that, again: ſtrange drowſineſs! But
he gives an excuſe for them, which alſo tells us the cauſe of it,
the <hi>Spirit is willing;</hi> their hearts were not altogether unconcerned,
<hi>but the Fleſh,</hi> that is the Body that was <hi>weak,</hi> that is, ſubject to
be abuſed by Satan, who brought them into a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
indiſpoſition, as is noted <hi>verſ. 43. their Eyes were heavy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Spiritual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions.</note> The <hi>Soul</hi> hath alſo its <hi>indiſpoſitions,</hi> which he readily
improves againſt Duty to hinder it. As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is capable of a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſluggiſhneſs and dulneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the ſpiritual Senſes are ſo bound up, that it <hi>conſiders not,</hi> minds
not, hath no liſt, nor inclination to acts of ſervice. What a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifaction
are our Spirits capable of? as <hi>David</hi> in his Adultery ſeems
not to mind, nor care what he had done. In like manner are
ſome in a <hi>Lethargy,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, they <hi>care not to ſeek
after God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> 
                        <hi>Bernard</hi> hath a deſcription of it, <hi>Contrahitur animus,
ſubtrahitur gratia, deferveſcit novitius fervor, ingraveſcit tepor faſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioſus;</hi>
the Spirit is contracted, Grace withdrawn, Fervour abates,
Sluggiſhneſs draws on, and then Duties are neglected.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Spirit is indiſpoſed by a <hi>throng of worldly affairs,</hi>
and theſe oft juſtle out duty. Chriſt tells us, they have the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon Men that Gluttony and Drunkenneſs have, and theſe
unfit Men for action, <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luk. 21. 34.) to your ſelves,
leſt at any time your heart be overcharged with ſurfeiting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49412:79"/>
and the eares of this life.</hi> Theſe then may at ſo high a rate
overcharge the ſouls of Men, ſo as to make them frame excuſes;
<hi>I have bought a Farm, or Oxen,</hi> and therefore <hi>I cannot attend,</hi> and
by this means may they grow ſo neglective, that the <hi>day of the
Lord may come upon them at unawares.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Sometimes the Soul is <hi>diſcompoſed through Paſſion,</hi> and
then 'tis indiſpoſed, which opportunity the Devil eſpying, he
cloſeth in with it; ſometime he <hi>blows the fire</hi> that the heat of
anger may put them upon a careleſneſs; ſometimes he <hi>pleads
their preſent frame,</hi> as an unfitneſs for Service, and ſo upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of reverence to the Service, and <hi>leaving the gift at the Altar</hi>
till they be in a better humor, many times the gift is <hi>not offered</hi>
at all, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. The Apoſtle directs Husbands to manage their
authority over their Wives with prudence, for the avoiding of
Brawls and Contentions, <hi>Ye Husbands dwell with them according
to Knowledg, giving honour to the Wife a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of which advice he gives in theſe words, <hi>that your prayers be
not hindred.</hi> Prayers are hindred partly in their <hi>ſucceſs</hi> when they

<hi>put by</hi> and ſuſpended: and this doubtleſs the Apoſtle aimes at,
to teach us that Contentious Quarellings in a Family hinder
the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of the duty of Prayer. <hi>Eliſha</hi> 2 Kings 3. diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

the preſence of</hi> Jehoſaphat, <hi>I would not look toward thee, nor ſee thee.</hi>
But when he ſet himſelf to receive the viſions of God, he calls for
a <hi>Minſtrel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rutherford</hi> Divine Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</note> verſ. 15. the reaſon whereof (as <hi>P. Mantyr,</hi> and
others ſuppoſe) was this, that however what he ſpoke to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam</hi>
proceeded from zeal, yet being but a Man and ſubject to
the like infirmities of other Men, it had <hi>diſtracted</hi> and <hi>diſcompoſed</hi>
his Spirit, which made him unfit and <hi>uncapable</hi> to entertain the
<hi>viſions of God.</hi> Muſick then being a natural means for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
and quiet of the Mind, he takes that courſe to calm and
fit himſelf for that work.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Prejudice</hi> are ſpiritual Indiſpoſitions,
which are not neglected by the Devil. Knowledg is the eye and
guide of the Soul. If there be darkneſs there, all acts which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon better Inſtruction muſt ceaſe. The Diſciples igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Scriptures, brought in their unbelief; Chriſt notes that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49412:79"/>
as the Fountain-head of all their backwardneſs, <hi>Luk. 24. 25.
O fools, and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken.</hi>
In like manner, if Men are not clear or knowing in the ways
and neceſſities of Duty and Service, the Devil can eaſily prevail
with them to forbear and neglect. <hi>Prejudice</hi> riſeth up to <hi>juſtifie</hi> the
diſregard of Duty, and offers <hi>Reaſons,</hi> which (it thinks) cannot
be anſwered.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. By diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragments.</note> Satan endeavours to prevent Duty by <hi>diſcouragements.</hi>
If he can make the <hi>knees feeble,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to duty four-fold.</note> and the <hi>hands hang down,</hi> he will
quickly cauſe Activity and Motion to ceaſe. The wayes by which he
endeavours to diſcourage Men from the duties of Service are theſe;</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. From the burthen of duty.</note> He ſets before them the <hi>toile</hi> and <hi>burthen</hi> of Duty. If a
Man ſets his Face toward Heaven, thus he endeavours to ſcare him
off; <hi>Is not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the way of Religion a dull, melancholy way?
It is not a toile? A tedious task? Are not theſe unreaſonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions,
Pray continually, Pray without ceaſing; Preach in ſeaſon and
out of ſeaſon?</hi> This ſuggeſtion though it be expreſly contrary to
command, yet being ſo ſuitable to the idle and ſluggiſh tempers
of Men, they are the more apt to take notice of it; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
they ſeek ways and ſhifts of accommodating the command
to their inclinations. In <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. the toyl of Sabbaths and
Feſtival Services (as they thought it) makes them weary of the
duty; <hi>When will the New Moon be gone, that we may ſell corn? and
the Sabbath, that we may ſet forth Wheat?</hi> Theſe Men thought
their Services tedious and intrenching upon their Callings and
Occupations. <hi>Mal. 1. 13. They ſaid, Behold, what, a wearineſs is it:</hi>
looking upon it as an inſufferable burthen; nay, they proceeded
ſo far, as to <hi>ſnuff</hi> at it. Now when the Devil had ſo far prevailed
with them, it was eaſie to put them upon neglect; which (as the
place cited ſpeaks) preſently followed upon it, they <hi>brought the
torne, and the lame, and the ſick for a Sacrifice.</hi> Satan firſt preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
theſe Services as a <hi>weariſome</hi> burthen, then they <hi>ſnuffed</hi> at them;
next they thought <hi>any</hi> Service <hi>good enough,</hi> how mean ſoever,
though to an open Violation of the Law of Worſhip: and laſtly,
from a <hi>pollution</hi> of the Table of the Lord, they proceeded to a
<hi>plain contempt of duty, the table of the Lord is polluted, and the fruit
thereof, even his meat is contemptible.</hi> verſ. 12. In the management
of this diſcouragement, the Devil hath moſt ſucceſs upon thoſe that
have <hi>not yet taſted</hi> the ſweetneſs and eaſineſs of the wayes of the
Lord, <hi>his yoke is indeed eaſie, his burthen is light;</hi> his <hi>ſervice</hi> is a true
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49412:80"/>
                        <hi>freedom</hi> to thoſe that are <hi>acquainted</hi> with God, and exerciſed in his
Service. But when Men are <hi>firſt beginning</hi> to look after God and
Duty, and are not yet filled, and <hi>ſatisfied with the fatneſs of his
houſe:</hi> this Temptation hath the greater force upon them, and
they are apt to be diſcouraged thereby.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 From want of ſucceſs.</note> He endeavours to diſcourage them, from the <hi>want of
ſucceſs</hi> in the Duties of Worſhip. When they have waited long
and ſought the Lord, then he puts them upon reſolves of declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any further Proſecution; as he did with <hi>Joram</hi> at the Siege
of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 King. 6. 33.</note> 
                        <hi>Why wait I upon the Lord any longer?</hi> (ſaid he) after he
had expected deliverance a long time without any appearance of
help.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 6, 7.</note> When <hi>Saul</hi> ſaw that God <hi>anſwered him not, neither by Dreams,
nor by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim, nor by Prophets,</hi> the Devil eaſily perſwaded him to
leave off the ordinary ways of attendance upon God, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
with the Witch of <hi>Endor.</hi> The prophane Perſons mentioned
in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14. that had caſt off all regard to his Laws, all reſpect
to his Ordinances, were brought to this pitch of Iniquity, by the
ſuggeſtions of want of ſucceſs; they ſaid, <hi>It is vain to ſerve God:
and what profit is it, that we have kept his ordinances, and that we have
walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> It ſeems they were like
the people ſpoken of in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 2, 3. They had <hi>faſted</hi> and prayed,
and God <hi>delayed</hi> to anſwer them, which they looked upon as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obligement
from duty; and that which they could peremptorily
inſiſt upon as a reaſon, which might juſtifie their neglect. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have we faſted, ſay they, and thou ſeeſt not? wherefore have we
afflicted our ſoul, and thou takeſt no knowledge?</hi> Neither doth this
diſcouragement fall heavy, only upon thoſe whoſe hearts are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
already</hi> from God, who might be ſuppoſed to be forward to
imbrace <hi>any excuſe</hi> from his Service; but we ſhall find it bears hard
upon the <hi>Children of God. David</hi> was ready to give over all, as
a Man forſaken of God, <hi>Pſal. 22. 1, 2. Why haſt thou forſaken me,
O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou heareſt not; and in the night
ſeaſon, and am not ſilent.</hi> We may clearly gather from his expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that this Temptation had ſorely bruiſed him, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God's delay of Anſwer, he was ready to charge an unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
upon Gods carriage toward him; for in that he adds, that
he kept his ground, and did not conſent to it (as the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<hi>But thou continueſt holy,</hi> do imply) it ſhewed what the
Devil was objecting to him. And elſewhere, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 3. When
he had cryed and was not anſwered, he began to be <hi>weary,</hi> and <hi>his
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49412:80"/>
eyes failed;</hi> nay, his <hi>fleſh and heart failld:</hi> his Spirit ſunk, as a Man
almoſt vanquiſhed and overcome with the Temptation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. From the unſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the heart in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> This our Adverſary raiſeth up diſcouragements to us
from the <hi>unſuitableneſs</hi> of our Hearts to our Services; herein he
endeavours to <hi>deaden</hi> our Hearts, to clog our Spirits, to hinder and
moleſt us, and then he <hi>improves</hi> theſe <hi>indiſpoſitions</hi> and diſcompoſures
againſt the duty in which he hath a double advantage: for (1) He
deprives us of that <hi>delight</hi> in duty which ſhould <hi>whet</hi> on our deſires
to undertake it, ſo that we come to the Lord's Table as old <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zillai,</hi>
without a taſte or reliſh of what we eat or drink. When we
come to hear, the Ear that <hi>tryeth words,</hi> as the Pallat taſteth meat,
finds no ſavour in what is ſpoken; and this Satan can eaſily do
by the inward deadneſs or <hi>diſquiet</hi> of the Heart: even as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of Diſeaſes takes away all Pleaſures which the choiceſt dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
afford.<note place="margin">Job 33. 20.</note> As <hi>Job</hi> obſerves, <hi>When a Man is chaſtned with pain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his bed, his life abhors bread, and his Soul dainty meat.</hi> And
when a Man is brought to loath his Duties, as having nothing
of that ſweetneſs and ſatisfaction in them which is every where
ſpoken of, a ſmall Temptation may put him upon neglect of
them. (2) He hath plauſible and colourable <hi>Arguments,</hi> by which
he formeth an Opinion in the minds of Men, that in <hi>caſes of
indiſpoſition</hi> they may <hi>do better to forbear than to proceed.</hi> He tells
them, <hi>they ought not to pray or preſent any ſervice while they are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed,
that no prayer is acceptable where the Spirit doth not enliven the
heart, and raiſe the affections; that they do not take his name in vain,
and increaſe their Sin, and that they ſhould wait till the Spirit fill their
ſails:</hi> and to ſay the truth, it is a great difficulty for a Child of
God to hold his feet in ſuch <hi>ſlippery places;</hi> how many have I
known complaining of this, and perſwading themſelves verily,
that they might do far better to leave off all Service, than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them thus? and ſcarcely have I reſtrained them from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with Satan, by telling them, that indiſpoſitions are no
<hi>bar</hi> to duty; but that <hi>duty</hi> is the way to get our indiſpoſitions
<hi>cured.</hi> That Duty is <hi>abſolutely</hi> required, and <hi>diſpoſitions</hi> to be <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured;</hi>
and that 'tis a leſs <hi>offence</hi> to keep to duty <hi>under indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,</hi>
than wholly upon that pretence to <hi>neglect</hi> it. And indeed,
where theſe indiſpoſitions are <hi>bemoaned</hi> and ſtriven with, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
are often more <hi>acceptable to God,</hi> than pleaſing to <hi>our ſelves:</hi>
the <hi>Principle</hi> is truly <hi>Spiritual</hi> and excellent; <hi>a foundation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirs</hi>
and <hi>precious Stones,</hi> upon which (if we patiently wait) he
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49412:81"/>
will <hi>build a Pallace of Silver;</hi> for that Service is more <hi>Spiritual</hi> that
is bottom'd, and carry'd on by <hi>a conſciencious regard to a Command,</hi>
when there are <hi>no moral Motives</hi> from ſence and comfort <hi>concurring,</hi>
than that which hath <hi>more of delight</hi> to encourage it, while the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the command is leſs ſwaying</hi> and influential.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. From un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs of the priviledg.</note> Men are oft diſcouraged from a <hi>ſence of unworthineſs</hi>
of the priviledge of Duty, a kind <hi>of exceſs</hi> of Humility, which
principally relates to the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper and Prayer;</hi>
the Accuſer of the Brethren tells them, that they have nothing to
do to take the Name of God in their mouthes, that 'tis an inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Preſumption. Hence, ſome like the Woman with the bloody
Iſſue, dare not come to Chriſt to <hi>ask a cure,</hi> while yet they <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
deſire it;</hi> and would rather, if they could privately <hi>ſteal</hi> it,
then <hi>openly beg it.</hi> The <hi>Publican</hi> is preſented to us in the Parable,
as one that could ſcarce get over that objection; he is ſet forth
ſtanding at a <hi>diſtance, not daring to lift up his eyes to Heaven;</hi> ſcarce
attempting to ſpeak, rather expreſſing his unworthineſs to Pray,
than ſetting upon the Duty: his <hi>ſmiting upon his breaſt,</hi> and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner,</hi> argued, that much of theſe
diſcouragements lay upon him. The like we may ſee in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal,</hi>
who it ſeems had it long <hi>in diſpute,</hi> whether he ſhould go

he could make <hi>any other ſhift,</hi> he yielded to the Temptation: at

ſay, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and thee, and am not worthy to be
called thy Son.</hi> Which ſhew, that the ſenſe of this kept him off
till neceſſity forced him over it. And this is a diſcouragement the
more likely to prevail for a neglect of Service; becauſe <hi>part of</hi>
it is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> as the beginning of thoſe Convictions of our Folly:
to have ſuch <hi>low thoughts</hi> of our ſelves, that we are not worthy to
come into his preſence, nor to look toward him, is very <hi>becoming;</hi>
but to think, that we ſhould <hi>not come</hi> to him, becauſe our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

ſuch as God never intended from the premiſes, but the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
<hi>Come, ſaith God, though unworthy.</hi> The like courſe doth the
Devil take to keep Men off from the Lord's Table; <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>'tis a very ſolemn Ordinance; he that partaketh of it unworthily, eateth
and drinketh Damnation to himſelf: how dareſt thou make ſuch bold
approaches?</hi> While the Hearts of Men are tender, their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
quick and accuſing, the threatning begets a fear, and they

is unto thee Lord. Paul</hi> ſeems to ſpeak his ſenſe of this piece of
Policy; his Impriſonment adminiſtred matter of reproach to his

as <hi>an evil doer;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 9.</note> this he knew the Devil would improve to a ſhame

preached in their Synagogues, to the applauſe and aſtoniſhment of

finds out this ſhift, to bring them to a diſlike of him, and his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>Is not this the Carpenters Son? And they were offended in him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Duties are brought under diſlike by the <hi>hazards</hi> that
attend them:<note place="margin">2 From Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards.</note> the Devil leaves it not untold, what Men ſhall
meet with from the World, if they <hi>run not with them into exceſs
of vanity</hi> and neglect; if Bonds, Impriſonments, Baniſhments,
Hatreds, Oppoſitions, Spoyling of Goods, Sufferings of all kinds

them: which though they do not move ſome from their ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs;
ſuch as <hi>Daniel,</hi> whoſe conſtancy in duty was not pierced

the ways of the Lord for the terrour of a <hi>fiery Furnace.</hi> Yet
theſe conſiderations prevail with moſt, as Chriſt notes, in thoſe
that received Seed in ſtony places, whoſe joy in the Word was ſoon
blaſted, and they offended at the ways of Duty, <hi>When Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

is not a common mercy. And if we ſhall obſerve <hi>Paul</hi>'s practice,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49412:82"/>
upon his firſt undertaking of the Miniſtry,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16.</note> when <hi>it pleaſed God to
call him</hi> to preach his Son Chriſt among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> we ſhall ſee,
(1) That he was aware of ſuch objections as theſe. (2) That
<hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> are apt to comply with them, and to take notice of
them. (3) And that the beſt way to avoid them is, to ſtop the
Ears againſt them, and not to hearken to them, or <hi>conſult</hi> with
them. (4) And that he that muſt do it to purpoſe, muſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay, <hi>immediately</hi> reſolve againſt ſuch hinderances; it being
moſt difficult for Men that will be inclining to ſuch motions, and
hearkning to what the Devil offers, under pretence of Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
to diſingage themſelves after they have ſuffered their
Souls to take the impreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 From the outward meanneſs of Services.</note> The <hi>meanneſs</hi> of Religious Appointments (as to the
outward view) is alſo made uſe of, to beget a loathing of them.
In this the Devil hath this advantage, that however they are all
<hi>glorious within,</hi> and <hi>as the curtains of Solomon;</hi> yet are they as to
their outward appearance like the <hi>tents of Kedar,</hi> without any of
that Pomp and Splendor which the Sons of Men affect and admire.
Chriſt himſelf when he had vailed his glory by our Fleſh, was of
no exteriour <hi>form or beauty.</hi> The Miniſtration of his Word, which
is <hi>the Scepter of his Kingdom,</hi> ſeems contemptible, and a very <hi>fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
to men; inſomuch, that <hi>Paul</hi> was forced to make an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
for it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 1, 4, 6.</note> in that it wanted thoſe outward braveries of <hi>excellency of
ſpeech and wiſdom,</hi> by ſhewing it was <hi>glorious in its power,</hi> and was
indeed an <hi>hidden wiſdom</hi> (though not like that <hi>wiſdom which the
Princes of Wiſdom,</hi> and Philoſophy affected) <hi>among ſuch as were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
The <hi>Sacraments</hi> both of the <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new Teſtament</hi> ſeemed
very low and contemptible things to a common eye; neither need
we any other evidence to ſhew, that Men are apt to diſreliſh them,
and to entertain ſtrange thoughts of them upon this very account,
than this, that ſome raiſe up Batteries againſt theſe Ordinances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ground, that becauſe they ſeem <hi>low</hi> and <hi>mean</hi> to them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they think it <hi>improbable,</hi> that God ſhould have indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them to be uſed in the literal ſenſe, or that at beſt they
are to be uſed as <hi>the firſt rudiments</hi> of Chriſtianity, and not
enjoyned upon the more <hi>grown Chriſtians.</hi> Neither may I alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
paſs over that <hi>remarkable humour,</hi> that is in ſome, to give
<hi>additional ornaments</hi> of outward Garb and Form, for the greater
honour and luſtre of theſe injunctions of Chriſt; ſo that while
they endeavour to ſhew their <hi>greateſt reſpects</hi> to them, they betray
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49412:83"/>
their <hi>inward thoughts</hi> to have carryed ſome <hi>ſuſpition</hi> of their reality
becauſe of their <hi>plainneſs;</hi> and by this means whilſt they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to put an <hi>honour</hi> upon Chriſts Inſtitutions, they really deſpiſe
them, and ſhew their reſpects to their <hi>own inventions.</hi> But that we
may be further ſatisfied, that Satan works by this Engine, let us
conſider, that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. The <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>for Signs</hi> from
Heaven, to give a Credit and Teſtimony to that Doctrine which
they would receive. The <hi>Greeks</hi> (who were then the only people
for Learning) were for <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Speculations, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes.
Now (ſaith the Apoſtle) the Doctrine of the Goſpel (which
is the Preaching of Chriſt crucified) becauſe it came not within
the compaſs of what both theſe expected, therefore the Devil ſo
wrought upon this advantage, that both contemned it, <hi>It was to
the</hi> Jews <hi>a ſtumbling-block, and to the</hi> Greeks <hi>fooliſhneſs.</hi> Of this
alſo he ſpeaks more fully, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. Where he ſhews, that the
<hi>minds</hi> of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were ready to be <hi>corrupted</hi> with Error,
againſt the plain import of the Goſpel; and that which they took
offence at, was its <hi>Simplicity:</hi> they looked upon it as contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
becauſe not containing ſuch <hi>gorgious</hi> things as might ſuit a
<hi>ſoaring</hi> and wanton fancy. Now he reſolves all this into a cheat
of Satan, taking the <hi>advantage</hi> of this, (as he did upon <hi>Eve</hi> from
the ſeeming inconſiderableneſs of the prohibition of eating a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Fruit) to perſwade them, that ſo mean a thing as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
could not be of God. <hi>I fear</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>leſt by any means,
as the Serpent beguiled</hi> Eve <hi>through his ſubtilty, ſo your minds ſhould
be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4 From the Sins of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.</note> The <hi>Sins of Profeſſors,</hi> through the craft of Satan,
beget a loathing of theſe holy things. If God <hi>loath</hi> his own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,
and <hi>cannot bear them,</hi> becauſe of the Iniquities of thoſe
that offer them; no wonder, if Men be tempted to diſgraceful
apprehenſions of them, when they obſerve ſome that pretend an
<hi>high care,</hi> and <hi>deep reſpect</hi> for them, <hi>live prophanely.</hi> The Sins of
<hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons wrought this ſad Effect upon the People, <hi>that Men</hi> (for
their ſakes) <hi>abhorred the offerings of the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 17. Thoſe
that fell off to Error, and thence to abominable Practices, <hi>cauſed
the way of Truth to be evil ſpoken of,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 2. The Prieſts that
departed out of the way, <hi>cauſed many to ſtumble at the Law, Mal. 2.
8.</hi>
Nay, ſo high doth Satan purſue this ſometimes, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
an inlet to direct <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">5 From a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Satan alſo works mightily in the <hi>prophane diſpoſitions</hi> of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49412:83"/>
Men, and acts that Principle to a diſregard and wearineſs of the
Services of God; a flagitious wicked life naturally leads to it:
thoſe that <hi>eat up Gods people as bread,</hi> Pſal. 14. 4. <hi>called not upon
God.</hi> This eats out at laſt the very exteriour and formal obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religious Duties, in this Satan bends his force againſt
them: (1) By <hi>heightning</hi> the Spirits of Men to an inſolent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
of God by a <hi>continued proſperity:</hi> He draws out the pride and
vanity of their Spirits,<note place="margin">Jer. 2. 31.</note> to a bold contempt, <hi>Who is the Lord that
we ſhould ſerve him? We are Lords, we will come no more at thee: our
tongues are our own,</hi> &amp;c. Thus they <hi>ſet their mouthes againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Eliphaz</hi> tells us this, as the uſual carriage of thoſe that lived
in peace and jollity; <hi>Job 21. 15. Therefore ſay they unto God, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes; who is the
Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him?</hi> (2) By <hi>hiding</hi> from them the
<hi>neceſſities</hi> of Duty. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> Job. 27. 10. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
him by theſe neglects of Duty, <hi>Will he delight himſelf in the
Almighty? will be always call upon God?</hi> Of this he gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>verſ. 9. He will call and cry when trouble comes upon him.</hi> When
diſtreſſes make Duties neceſſary, then he will uſe them; in his
<hi>Affliction he will ſeek him early,</hi> Hoſ. 5. 15. As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did,
<hi>Pſal. 78. 34. When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and enquired
early after God.</hi> But when he is not thus pinched (and Satan will
endeavour in this caſe, that he be as far from the Rod of God, as
he can make him) he gives over ſeeking God, and loaths it;
nay, accounts it as ridiculous ſo to do: they <hi>mock at his counſel,</hi>
and contemn his advice of waiting upon him.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6 From the manner of performance.</note> Satan picks quarrels in Men, at the <hi>manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of Duty.</hi> When Duty cannot be ſpoken againſt, then he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to deſtroy it by the <hi>Modes, Circumſtances,</hi> and way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance:
as (1) If thoſe that act in them diſcover any <hi>weakneſs</hi>
(as who doth not, when he hath done his beſt?) this he endeavours
to blemiſh the Duty withal. The bodily <hi>preſence</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
againſt him, as being <hi>contemptible,</hi> and his <hi>ſpeech as weak;</hi>
but the deſign of that objection lay higher, the Devil thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to render the <hi>Duties of his Miniſtry</hi> as contemptible,
and not to be regarded. (2) If the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> pleaſe not, he
teacheth them to take pet with the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and like Children to
reject all, becauſe every thing is not ſuitable to their wills. (3) If
it be managed in any way not <hi>grateful</hi> to their expectations; if
too <hi>cuttingly</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> then they think they be juſtified to ſay,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49412:84"/>
                        <hi>they hate it,</hi> as <hi>Ahab</hi> did <hi>Micaiah:</hi> if any way too <hi>high or abſtruſely,</hi>
then likewiſe they fling off. On this Point the Devil perſwaded
many of Chriſts followers to deſert him, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6. 66. becauſe he
had ſpoken of himſelf in compariſons, that they judged too high;
when he ſaid, He was <hi>that Bread that came down from Heaven,
verſ.</hi> 58. they ſaid, That <hi>was a ſaying not to be born:</hi> and on that
occaſion, <hi>they went back, and walked no more with him.</hi>

Worſhip, by a <hi>wrong repreſentation</hi> of them, in the carriage and

that are but as <hi>idle ſpectators,</hi> to obſerve the poſtures of Saints:
ſeriouſly <hi>lifting up their eyes</hi> to Heaven, or humbly mourning,
and <hi>ſmiting on their breaſts;</hi> theſe the Devil would render ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
and as the <hi>ſuſpicious</hi> managements, of an <hi>Hiſtrionical or
Hypocritical Devotion:</hi> as Men at a diſtance beholding the ſtrange
variety of actions and poſtures of ſuch as dance, being out of the
ſound of their Muſick, ſhall think them a company of mad Men,
and frantick People. Such <hi>perverſe proſpects</hi> doth he ſometimes
afford to thoſe, that come rather to obſerve what others do, than
to concern themſelves in ſuch duties; that, not ſeeing their <hi>private
influences,</hi> nor the <hi>ſecret ſpring</hi> that moves them, they judge them
<hi>fooliſh;</hi> and from thence they contract an inward loathing of the

Nature.</hi> That they are <hi>in God and Chriſt,</hi> and have the <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications</hi>

made no other uſe of the <hi>grace of God</hi> but to <hi>turn it into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jud. 4. <hi>verſ.</hi>
                        </note> yet were they ſo tumified with the apprehenſions of their
Priviledges, that whilſt they deſigned no other thing, than plain
<hi>licentiouſneſs,</hi> and a wantonneſs in the luſts of the Fleſh; yet (it

improves what the Scriptures ſpeak, of the <hi>differences</hi> of God's
Children; that ſome are <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> ſome are <hi>carnal;</hi> ſome <hi>weak,</hi>

apprehend themſelves Chriſtians of an <hi>higher rank</hi> and order, which
alſo makes way conſequently for a further inference,<note place="margin">1 Jo. 2. 12, 13.</note> 
                        <hi>(viz.)</hi> That
there muſt needs be <hi>immunities and priviledges</hi> ſuitable to theſe
heights and attainments. To this purpoſe, (3) he produceth thoſe
Scriptures that are deſign'd by God, to raiſe up the minds of Men,
to look after the <hi>internal Work and Power</hi> of his Ordinances, and
not to center their minds and hopes in the bare <hi>formal uſe</hi> of them,
without applying their thoughts to God and Chriſt; unto whom,
they are appointed to lead us. Such as theſe Scriptures, <hi>Rom. 2.
28. He is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
which is outward in the fleſh: but he is a Jew, which is one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
and circumciſion is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, and not in
the letter.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 7. we ſhould <hi>ſerve in newneſs of ſpirit, and
not in the oldneſs of the letter.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 16. <hi>Wherefore henceforth
know we no man after the fleſh, yea though we have known Chriſt after
the fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 13. <hi>He
gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the perfecting of the
Saints—till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge
of the Son of God unto a perfect man.</hi> By a perverſe Interpretation
of theſe, and ſome other Scriptures of like import, he would
perſwade them, That the great thing that Chriſt deſigned by his
Ordinances, was, but to <hi>train up the weaker Chriſtians by theſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments</hi>
(as the <hi>A, B, C,</hi> to Children) to a more <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi>
way of living upon God: and that theſe become <hi>altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49412:85"/>
uſeleſs,</hi> when Chriſtians have gotten up to any of theſe <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
degrees</hi> of a ſuppoſed Perfection. Enough of this may be
ſeen in the writings of <hi>Saltmarſh, Winſtanly,</hi> and others, in the
late times. How great a Trade Satan drove by ſuch miſapprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
not long ſince, cannot eaſily be forgotten; ſo that God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
did almoſt <hi>lye waſt;</hi> and in many places, <hi>the way to Sion
did mourn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 By pleading an inequality of Duty.</note> He will ſometimes confeſs an <hi>equality of priviledge</hi>
among the Children of God, and yet plead an <hi>inequality of duty,</hi>
that God is as good and ſtrong to us, and that we have all an equal
advantage by Chriſt, he will readily acknowledge. But then when
we ſhould propound the <hi>diligence</hi> of the Saints in their Services
for our <hi>pattern</hi> (as of <hi>Davids praying ſeven times a day,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Greenham.</hi> pag. 35.</note> Daniels
<hi>three times,</hi> Anna's <hi>ſerving God with faſtings and prayers night and
day,</hi> &amp;c.) He tells us, theſe were <hi>extraordinary</hi> Services, and (as
it were) works of <hi>ſupererrogation,</hi> more than the Command of God
laid upon them. So that we are not <hi>tyed to ſuch ſtrictneſs;</hi> and
we being naturally apt to indulge our ſelves in our own eaſe,
are too ready to comply with ſuch Deluſions. And by degrees
Men are thus brought to a confident belief, that they may be
<hi>good enough,</hi> and do <hi>as much as is required,</hi> though they <hi>ſlacken</hi> their
pace, and do not Faſt, Pray, or Hear ſo often, as others have
done.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. By height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> Another Sophiſm of his, <hi>is to heighten one Duty, to the
ruine of another.</hi> He ſtrives to make an <hi>inteſtine War</hi> among the
ſeveral <hi>parts</hi> of the Services we owe to God; and from the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of one,</hi> to raiſe up an enmity, and <hi>undervaluing diſregard of
another.</hi> Thus would he ſever, as inconſiſtent, thoſe things that
God hath joyned together. As among falſe Teachers, ſome ſay,
<hi>Lo here is Chriſt;</hi> and others, <hi>Lo he is there.</hi> So we find Satan
dealing with Duties, he puts ſome upon ſuch high reſpects to
<hi>Preaching,</hi> that (ſay they) Chriſt is to be found <hi>here,</hi> moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
rather than in <hi>Prayer,</hi> or other Ordinances; others are made
to have the like eſteem for <hi>Prayer:</hi> and they affirm, in this is Chriſt
<hi>eſpecially</hi> to be met withal. Others ſay the like of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> or
Meditation. In all theſe Satan labours to beget a diſlike and
neglect of other Services. Thus (in what relates to the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Churches) he endeavours to ſet up <hi>purity</hi> of Churches,
to the Deſtruction of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> or <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> to the ruine of <hi>Purity.</hi> A
notable Example hereof we have in the <hi>Euchytae,</hi> (a Sect of <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49412:85"/>
Hereticks,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Theod. Eccleſ. <hi>Hiſtoria.</hi>
                        </note> which aroſe in the time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Valens)</hi>
who upon the pretence of the Commands of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> for
<hi>Praying continually,</hi> or <hi>without ceaſing</hi> and <hi>fainting,</hi> owned no other
Duty as neceſſary; vilifying Preaching and Sacraments, as things
(at beſt) uſeleſs and unprofitable. The like attempts he makes
daily upon Men,<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 1.</note> where though he prevail not ſo far, as to bring
ſome neceſſary Duties of Service into <hi>open contempt;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 15. 17.</note> yet he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
them into too much <hi>ſecret neglect,</hi> and diſregard.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4 By ſevering the means from the end.</note> He improves the <hi>grace of the Goſpel,</hi> to infer an <hi>unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarineſs
of Duty;</hi> and this he doth, not only from the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of a <hi>prophane</hi> and careleſs Spirit in ſuch as <hi>preſumptuouſly</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
Heaven,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Greenham.</hi> pag. 35.</note> though they mind not <hi>the way</hi> that leads to it: for
with ſuch it is uſual (as one obſerves) for Satan to <hi>ſever the means
from the end,</hi> in things that are <hi>good,</hi> to make them believe, they
<hi>ſhall have Peace, though they walk in the Imaginations of their Heart;</hi>
to make them lean upon the Lord for Heaven, in the apparent
neglect of Holineſs and Duty. As in <hi>evil things,</hi> he ſevers <hi>the end
from the means,</hi> making them confident they ſhall <hi>eſcape Hell</hi> and
Condemnation, though they <hi>walk</hi> in the path that leads thither.
But beſides this, he abuſeth the underſtandings and affections of
Men, by ſtrange and <hi>uncouth</hi> inferences; as <hi>that God hath received a
ſatisfaction, and Chriſt hath done all;</hi> ſo that nothing <hi>is left for us
to do.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo much aware of this kind of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing,
that when he was <hi>to magnifie the Grace of God,</hi> he always
took care to <hi>fence</hi> againſt ſuch perverſe reaſonings; ſeverely <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking</hi>
and refelling ſuch <hi>objections:</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 7, 8. Where
ſpeaking, that <hi>our unrighteouſneſs did commend the righteouſneſs of God,</hi>
he falls upon that reply, <hi>Why then am I judged as a ſinner?</hi> Which
he ſharply refells, as an inference of ſlanderous imputation to the
Goſpel, which hath nothing in it to give the leaſt countenance to
that Concluſion, <hi>Let us do evil, that good may come.</hi> And adds,
That <hi>Damnation</hi> ſhall <hi>juſtly</hi> overtake ſuch as practiſe accordingly.
The like we have, <hi>Rom. 6. 1. Shall we continue in ſin, that grace
may abound?</hi> which he rejected with the greateſt abhorrency,
<hi>God forbid!</hi> From both which places we may plainly gather, that
as unſound as ſuch arguings are, yet Men (through Satans ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty)
are too prone, upon ſuch pretences, to diſpute themſelves
to a careleſs neglect of Duty. This might be enlarged in many
other inſtances, as that of <hi>Maximus Tyrius,</hi> who diſputed all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
unneceſſary upon this ground, <hi>That what God will give, cannot
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49412:86"/>
be hindred; and what he will not give, cannot be obtained;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'twere needleſs to ſeek after any thing. Much to the ſame
purpoſe do many argue, If they be <hi>Predeſtinated to Salvation they
ſhall be ſaved, though they do never ſo little; if they be not Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
they ſhall not be ſaved though they do never ſo much.</hi> In all
which inferences the Devil proceeds upon a falſe Foundation, of
ſevering the Means, and the End, which the <hi>Decree</hi> of God hath
joyned together: but the main of the Deſign, is to hide the
neceſſity of Duty from them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5 By ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> By urging a neceſſity or conveniency for <hi>ſuſpending</hi> or
<hi>remitting</hi> Duties. In temptations to Sin, he doth from a little,
draw on the Sinner to more; but in omiſſions of Duty, he would
<hi>entice us, from much to little; and from little, to nothing.</hi> Very buſie
he is with us, to break, or interrupt our <hi>conſtant courſe</hi> of Duty.
Duties in order, and Practice, are like ſo many <hi>Pearls</hi> upon one
ſtring, if the <hi>thread</hi> be broken, it may hazard the <hi>ſcattering</hi> of all.
If we be once put out of our way, we are in danger to roave far
before we be ſet in our rank again. To effect this (1) He will
be ſure to <hi>ſtraiten</hi> or hinder us in our <hi>opportunities</hi> if he can, and then
to plead neceſſity for a Diſpenſation. 'Tis true indeed, <hi>neceſſities,</hi>
when unavoidable (as the iſſue of <hi>Providence,</hi> rather than our <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence)</hi>
may <hi>excuſe</hi> an omiſſion of Duty: becauſe in ſuch caſes,
<hi>God accepting the will for the deed, will have mercy and not ſacrifice.</hi>
But neceſſity is, moſt-what a pretence or cover to the ſlothfulneſs
of Profeſſors; and the Devil will do all he can to gratifie them
in that humour, and to prepare Excuſes for them, from ſuch hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances
or interruptions, as buſineſs, or diſturbances can make:
yet if theſe be not in readineſs, he will (2) endeavour to take off
our earneſtneſs, by ſuggeſting to us our <hi>former diligence,</hi> that we at
other times have been careful and active: Or (3) by ſetting before
us the <hi>greater negligence</hi> of thoſe that are below us. The meaning of
both which inſinuations is to this one purpoſe, that we may make
<hi>bold</hi> with ſome omiſſions, without any great <hi>hazard</hi> of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
intentions, or ſcandal and offence to others. Now, if he
can by any of theſe wayes, bring us to any <hi>abatement</hi> of our wonted
care and exerciſe, he will then ſtill <hi>preſs for more,</hi> and from <hi>fervency</hi>
of Spirit, to a <hi>cold</hi> moderation; from thence he will labour to
bring us down to <hi>ſeldom performances:</hi> from thence, to <hi>nothing.</hi>
The Spiritual <hi>Sluggard</hi> that will be overcome to ſome neglects,
ſhall be found a <hi>companion at laſt to a Waſter;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 18. 9.</note> and will be brought
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49412:86"/>
to a total neglect of all. The Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Rev. 2. 4, 5.
may ſadly give proof of this, they <hi>left their firſt love;</hi> and from
thence declined ſo far, that at laſt God was provoked to <hi>remove
the Candleſtick out of its place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Satan puts tricks upon Men, (in order to the hindring
of Duty) by putting us from a Service <hi>preſently needful,</hi> with the
<hi>propoſal of another,</hi> in which, at that time, we are not <hi>ſo concerned.</hi>
In ſeveral Duties of Chriſtianity, there is a great deal of skill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to make a right choice, for preſent or <hi>firſt</hi> performance;
and to have a right judgment to diſcover the <hi>times</hi> and ſeaſons
of them, is matter of neceſſary ſtudy. Our Adverſary obſerving
our weakneſſes in this, (when no other art will prevail,) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to put us upon an <hi>inconvenient choice,</hi> when he cannot make
us neglect all. As (1) by engaging us in a leſs <hi>duty,</hi> that we may
neglect a <hi>greater;</hi> he is willing that we (as the <hi>Phariſees)</hi> ſhould
<hi>tithe Mint and Annis,</hi> upon condition that we <hi>neglect the greater
things of the Law.</hi> This was the fault of <hi>Martha,</hi> Luk. 10. 41. who
buſied her ſelf in making entertainment for Chriſt's welcome,
and in the mean time neglected to hear his Preaching: which,
as he notes, was the only neceſſary Duty of that time; <hi>one thing</hi>
is neceſſary. She is not blamed, for doing that which was <hi>ſimply
evil</hi> in it ſelf (for the thing ſhe did was a Duty;) but for not
making <hi>a right choice</hi> of Duty; for that rebuke, <hi>Mary hath choſen
the better part,</hi> is only <hi>a comparative diſcommendation;</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets,
<hi>Non tu malam, ſed illa meliorem,</hi> the thing thou doeſt is
not evil, if it had not put thee upon a neglect of a greater good.
(2) He ſometimes puts Men upon what is <hi>good</hi> and neceſſary;
but ſuch, as <hi>they cannot come at without Sin.</hi> Thus Sacrificing in
it ſelf was a neceſſary duty: and ſuch was <hi>Sauls</hi> condition, that
it concerned him at that time, to make his peace with God, and
to enquire his mind. Yet when the Devil upon that pretence,
put him upon <hi>offering a Sacrifice,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 13. 13.</note> he put him upon no ſmall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.
The like game Satan ſometimes plays with private
Chriſtians, who are perſwaded <hi>beyond their ſtation</hi> and capacity in
reference to ſome Ordinances of God. (3) He ſometimes puts
Men upon <hi>dangerous undertakings</hi> in purſuit of their fancy, of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>an advantage</hi> for ſome ſervice; and ſo are they turned out of
the way of preſent Obedience, in graſping at opportunities of
Duty <hi>out of their reach.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 15, 22.</note> Saul <hi>ſpared the Sheep and Oxen</hi> of the
<hi>Amalokites</hi> for Sacrifice, when <hi>Obedience</hi> had been <hi>more acceptable</hi>
                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:49412:87"/>
than Sacrifice. (4) There is a further cheat in the choice of Duty;
when Satan employs them <hi>to provide for Duties to come,</hi> to the
neglect of Duties <hi>preſently incumbent</hi> upon them; whereas we are
more concerned in that, which, <hi>at preſent,</hi> is neceſſary; than in
that, which may be ſo for <hi>the future;</hi> which is a miſtake, like
that of <hi>caring for the morrow,</hi> while we uſe not what God puts
in our hand <hi>for to day.</hi>

Duty have been noted;<note place="margin">2. Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſpoile Duties.</note> what he comes ſhort in this deſign,
he next labours to make up, by <hi>ſpoyling</hi> and <hi>depraving</hi> them: and
this he doth endeavour <hi>three</hi> ways.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1 In the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us upon them.</note> By putting us upon Services <hi>in ſuch a manner</hi> as ſhall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them <hi>unacceptable,</hi> and diſpleaſing unto God, and unprofitable
to us: As (1) by a <hi>careleſs and raſh undertaking</hi> of Service. We
are commanded <hi>to take heed</hi> to our ſelves <hi>how we hear,</hi> or pray; and
to <hi>watch</hi> over our hearts, that they be in a fit poſture for meeting
with God. Becauſe the heart, in Service, is that which God moſt
looks at, and our ſervices are meaſured accordingly; if then by a
heedleſs undertaking; we adventure upon them, not keeping <hi>out
foot when we go into the houſe of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccleſ 5. 1.</note> we offer no other than the
<hi>Sacrifice of fools;</hi> and give occaſion to God to complain that
we do but <hi>draw neer to him with our lips, while our hearts are far
from him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The like ſpoil of Duty is made, when we adventure
upon it, in <hi>our own ſtrength,</hi> and not in the <hi>ſtrength of Chriſt.</hi>
Satan ſees the pride of our heart, and how much our gifts may
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49412:87"/>
contribute to it, and how prone we are to be confident of a right
performance of what we have ſo <hi>often</hi> practiſed before: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth he more induſtriouſly catch at that advantage, to make
us forget, that our <hi>ſtrength is in God;</hi> and that we cannot come to
him acceptably, but by his own power. Chriſtians are often
abuſed this way; when their ſtrength is to ſeek, Duty is oft <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly</hi>
ſet before them, that they may act as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did, when his
locks were cut, who thought to <hi>ſhake himſelf,</hi> and to <hi>go out as at
other times,</hi> and ſo fell into the hands of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If he can ſubſtitute <hi>baſe ends</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> as <hi>motives</hi>
to Duty, inſtead of theſe that God hath commanded, he knows
the Service will become ſtinking and loathſome to God. Faſting,
Prayers, Alms, Preaching, or any other Duty may be thus tainted,
when they are performed upon no better grounds, than <hi>to be ſeen
of Men,</hi> or <hi>out of Envy,</hi> or to ſatisfie <hi>humour,</hi> or when from <hi>cuſtom,</hi>
rather than <hi>conſcience.</hi> How frequently did the <hi>Prophets</hi> tax the
<hi>Jews</hi> for this, that they <hi>faſted to themſelves?</hi> and brought <hi>forth fruit
to themſelves?</hi> How ſeverely did Chriſt condemn the <hi>Phariſees</hi>
upon the ſame account? telling them, that in hunting the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
of Men, by theſe devotions, they had got all the reward
they were like to have.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When we do our Services <hi>unſeaſonably,</hi> not only the
grace and <hi>beauty</hi> of them is ſpoiled; but often are they rendred
<hi>unprofitable.</hi> There are times to be obſerved, not only for the
right management of common Actions, but alſo for Duties. What
is Chriſtian Reproof, if it be not rightly ſuited to ſeaſon, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity?
The ſame may be ſaid of other Services.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Services are ſpoiled, when Men ſet upon them <hi>without
reſolutions of leaving their Sins.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eze. 14 3.</note> While they come with their <hi>Idols
in their heart,</hi> and <hi>the ſtumbling-block of their iniquity before their
face, God will not be enquired of by them.</hi> He requires of thoſe
that preſent their Services to him, that (at leaſt) they ſhould not
affront him, with <hi>direct purpoſes</hi> of continuing in their Rebellions
againſt him: nay, he expects from his Servants, that look for a
Bleſſing in their Duties;<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 22.</note> that they come with their <hi>hearts ſprinkled
from an evil conſcience,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>and their bodies waſhed with pure water.</hi> If
they come to hear the Word, they muſt <hi>lay aſide all filthineſs, and
ſuperfluity of naughtineſs:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 8.</note> if they pray, they muſt <hi>lift up pure hands.</hi>
If they come to the Lords Supper; they muſt eat that Feaſt <hi>with
the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cor. 5. 8.</note> And albeit, he may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49412:88"/>
the Prayers of thoſe, that are ſo far convinced of their Sins
(though they be not yet ſanctified) that they are <hi>willing</hi> to lay
down their Weapons, and are touched with a ſence of <hi>Legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi>
for thus he heard <hi>Ahab,</hi> and regarded the Humiliation of
<hi>Nineveh.)</hi> Yet while Men <hi>cleave</hi> to the love of their iniquity, and are
not upon any <hi>terms</hi> of parting with their Sins, God will not
look to their Services, but abhor them. For thus he declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>Iſa. 1. 11. To what purpoſe is the multitude of your Sacrifices?
Bring no more vain oblations.—I cannot away with them, it is iniquity,
even the ſolemn meeting,—my ſoul hateth them, they are a trouble to
me, I am weary to bear them: when you ſpread forth your hands, I
will hide mine eyes from you, yea when you make many Prayers, I will
not hear.</hi> The ground of all this is, that their heart was no way
ſevered from the purpoſes of Sinning, <hi>Your hands are full of blood,</hi>
verſ. 15. Satan knowing this ſo well, he is willing that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in the Services of God; if they will keep up their <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
to him, and come with <hi>intentions</hi> to continue wicked ſtill:
for ſo while he cannot prevent the actual performance of Duty,
(which yet notwithſtanding he had rather do, becauſe he knows
not but God may by that means ſometime or other reſcue theſe
Slaves of Satan out of his hand) he makes their Services nothing
worth, and renders them abominable to God.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, In the manner of undertaking, Duties are ſpoiled,
when Men have not a <hi>ſubmiſſive ingenuity</hi> in them, by giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up to the <hi>direction</hi> and <hi>diſpoſal</hi> of the Almighty; but rather
<hi>confine</hi> and limit God to <hi>their wills</hi> and deſires. Sometimes Men
by attempting of Services to God, think thereby to engage God
to <hi>humour</hi> them in their wills and ways. With ſuch a mind did
<hi>Ahab</hi> conſult the Prophets about his expedition to <hi>Ramoth-Gilead;</hi>
not ſo much ſeeking <hi>Gods mind</hi> and counſel for direction, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby to engage God to confirm and <hi>comply with his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
With the ſame mind did <hi>Johanan</hi> and the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
conſult the Lord, concerning their going down to <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
Jer. 42. 5. Though they ſolemnly proteſted Obedience to what
God ſhould ſay, <hi>whether it were good or evil;</hi> yet when the return
from God, ſuited not with their deſires and reſolutions, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it to be the Command of God; and found <hi>an evaſion</hi> to free
themſelves of their engagement, <hi>Jer.</hi> 43. 2. Such dealings as theſe
being the evident undertakings of an Hypocritical heart, muſt needs
render all done upon that ſcore, to be preſumptuous temptings
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49412:88"/>
of God; no way deſerving the name of Service.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. In the act of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</note> Not only are Services thus ſpoiled, in thoſe wrong
grounds and ways of attempting, or ſetting about them, but in
the <hi>very act,</hi> or performance of them, while they are <hi>upon the Wheel,</hi>
(as a Potters Veſſel in the Prophet) they are often <hi>marred:</hi> and
this Satan doth two ways.<note place="margin">Two wayes.</note> (1) By <hi>diſturbing</hi> our thoughts, which
ſhould be attentive and fixed upon the Service in hand. (2) <hi>By
vitiating</hi> the Duty it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. By Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> By <hi>diſtracting</hi> or diſturbing our thoughts. This is an uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Policy of Satan. Thoſe Fowls which came down upon <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 12.</note> are ſuppoſed (by Learned Expoſitors) to ſignifie
thoſe means and ways by which the Devil doth diſorder and
trouble our thoughts in Religious Services. And Chriſt himſelf
compares the Devil ſtealing our thoughts from Duty, to the
<hi>Fowls of the Air,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 4.</note> that gather up the Seed as ſoon as it is ſown. There
are many reaſons that may perſwade us, that this is one of his
Maſter-pieces of Policy. As (1) in that the buſineſs of Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is oft, <hi>eaſily done;</hi> our thoughts do not <hi>naturally</hi> delight in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things, becauſe of their depravement; neither can they eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brook to be <hi>pent</hi> in, or confined ſo ſtrictly, as the nature of ſuch
imployments doth require; ſo that there is a kind of <hi>preternatural
force</hi> upon our thoughts, when they are Religiouſly imployed;
which as it is in it ſelf laborious: (like the ſtopping of a Stream,
or driving <hi>Jordan</hi> back;) ſo upon the leaſt <hi>relaxing</hi> of the <hi>Spring,</hi>
that muſt <hi>bend</hi> our thoughts Heaven-ward, they incline to their
natural bend and current. As a Stone rolled up a Hill, hath a
<hi>renitentia,</hi> a ſtriving againſt the hand that forceth it, and when that
force ſlackens, it goes down-ward. How eaſily then is it for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
to ſet our thoughts off our Work? If we ſlacken our Care
never ſo little they <hi>recoyle,</hi> and tend to their <hi>old Byas;</hi> and how
eaſie is it for him to take off our hand? when 'tis ſo much in his
power to <hi>inject thoughts</hi> and motions into our Hearts; or to <hi>preſent
Objects</hi> to our Eyes, or <hi>Sounds</hi> to our Ears, which by a <hi>natural force</hi>
raiſeth up our apprehenſion to act: for in ſuch caſes, <hi>non poſſumus
non cogitare:</hi> we cannot reſtrain the act of thinking, and not, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great heedfulneſs,</hi> can we reſtrain the <hi>purſuit</hi> of thoſe thinkings
and imaginations. (2) Satan can alſo do it <hi>inſenſibly;</hi> our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
or roveings of thoughts creep and ſteal upon us ſilently,
we no more know oft, when they begin, than when we begin to
ſleep; or when we begin to wander in a journey, where oft we do not
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49412:89"/>
take our ſelves to be out of the way, till we come to ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
turning. (3) And when he prevailes to <hi>divide</hi> our thoughts
from our Duty, he always makes great <hi>advantage;</hi> for thus he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
(at leaſt) the <hi>comfort</hi> and profit of Ordinances. While we are
buſied to <hi>look to our hearts,</hi> much of the Duty <hi>goeth by,</hi> and we
are but as thoſe, that in Publick Aſſemblies are imployed to ſee to
the order and ſilence of others, who can be ſcarce <hi>at leaſure</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for their own advantage. Beſides, much of the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of
Ordinances are abated by the <hi>very trouble</hi> of our Attendance. When
we are put to it (as <hi>Abraham</hi> was) to be ſtill driving away thoſe
Fowls that come down upon <hi>our Sacrifice,</hi> the very toil will eat
out, and eclipſe much of the comfort. Thus alſo he (at leaſt) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
matter to <hi>object</hi> againſt the ſincerity of the Servants of God;
and will aſſurly find a time, to ſet it home upon them to the
purpoſe, that their hearts were wandring in their Services. Thus
he further gets advantage for a temptation to <hi>leave off</hi> their Duty,
and will not ceaſe to improve ſuch diſtractions (as we have heard)
to an utter <hi>overthrow</hi> of their Services. Nay, if he prevail to give
us ſuch diſtractions as <hi>wholly takes away our minds,</hi> and ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
from the Service, then is the ſervice become nothing worth,
though the <hi>outward</hi> circumſtances of attendance be never ſo <hi>exact</hi>
and Saint-like. Who could appear in a more religious dreſs, than
thoſe in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. who came and <hi>ſate,</hi> and were pleaſed with
Divine Services (as to all outward diſcovery) <hi>as Gods People;</hi> yet
was all ſpoiled with this, that their <hi>hearts were after their Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this Diſtraction Satan can work <hi>two wayes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Outward diſturbances.</note> By <hi>outward Diſturbances.</hi> He can preſent Objects to the
<hi>Eyes,</hi> on purpoſe to entice our thoughts after them. The cloſing
of the Eyes in Prayer, is uſed by ſome of the Servants of God,
to prevent Satan's Temptations this way.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid.</hi> Clarks Lives.</note> And we find, in the
Story of Mr. <hi>Rothwel,</hi> that the Devil took notice of this in him,
That <hi>he ſhut his eyes to avoid diſtraction in prayer.</hi> Which implies,
a Conceſſion in the Devil, that by outward Objects he uſeth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
our diſtraction in Services. The like he doth by <hi>noiſes</hi>
and ſounds. Neither can we diſcover how much of theſe Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances,
(by Coughings, Hemmings, Tramplings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we
hear in greater Aſſemblies) are from Satan, by ſtirring up others to
ſuch noiſes. We are ſure the <hi>Damſel</hi> that had an unclean Spirit,
<hi>Act.</hi> 16. that grieved and troubled <hi>Paul</hi> (going about theſe Duties)
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49412:89"/>
with her Clamours, was ſet on by that Spirit within her, to diſtract
and call off their thoughts from the Services, which they were
about to undertake. Beſides, the common ways of giving trouble
to the Servants of God in outward Diſturbances, he ſometimes
(though rarely) doth it in an <hi>extraordinary</hi> manner: thus he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to hinder Mr. <hi>Rothwel</hi> from praying for a Poſſeſſed Perſon,
by <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>blaſpheming.</hi> The like hinderance we read, he gave
<hi>Luther,</hi> and others: and truly <hi>ſo ſtrict</hi> an attendance in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of our Minds, ſpiritual Sences, and Graces, is required in
matters of Worſhip: and ſo <hi>weak</hi> are our hearts in making a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
or beating off theſe aſſaults, that a very <hi>ſmal</hi> matter will
<hi>diſcompoſe</hi> us, and a <hi>ſmaller diſcompoſure</hi> will prejudice and <hi>blemiſh</hi>
the Duty.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Inward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions.</note> He diſtracts or diſturbs us alſo, by <hi>inward Workings,</hi>
and injections of Motions, and repreſentations of things to our
Minds: and as this is his moſt general and uſual way, ſo doth he
make uſe of greater variety of contrivance and art in it: As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By the troubleſome <hi>impetuouſneſs</hi> and violence of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
they come upon us as thick as Hail. No ſooner do we put
by one Motion, but another is in upon us: he hath his Quiver full
of theſe Arrows, and our hearts (under any Service) <hi>ſwarm</hi> with
them, we are inceſſantly infeſted by them, and have no reſt. At
other times, when we are upon worldly buſineſs, we may obſerve
a <hi>great eaſe</hi> and freedom in our thoughts; neither doth he ſo much
preſs upon us: but in theſe, Satan is continually <hi>knocking</hi> at our
door, and calling to us, ſo that it is a great hazard, that ſome or
other of theſe Injections may <hi>ſtick</hi> upon our thoughts, and lead
us out of the way; or if they do not, yet 'tis a great <hi>moleſtation</hi>
or toil to us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He can ſo order his dealings with us, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
us ſometimes, <hi>to follow him out of the Camp,</hi> and ſeeks to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare
us, by improving <hi>our own ſpiritual reſolution</hi> and hatred againſt
him; even as courage whetted on and enraged, makes a Man
<hi>venterſome</hi> beyond the due <hi>bounds</hi> of prudence, or ſafety. To this
end, he ſometimes caſts into our thoughts <hi>hideous, Blaſphemous,</hi> and
<hi>Atheiſtical</hi> ſuggeſtions, which do not only <hi>amaze</hi> us, but oftentimes
engage us to <hi>diſpute</hi> againſt them; which, at ſuch time, is all he ſeeks
for: for, whereas in ſuch caſes we ſhould ſend away ſuch thoughts
with a <hi>ſhort Anſwer, Get thee behind me Satan;</hi> We by taking up
the <hi>Buckler</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> againſt them, are drawn off from minding
our preſent Duty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:49412:90"/>
Thirdly, He doth ſometimes ſeek to allure, and draw our thoughts
to the Object, by repreſenting what is <hi>pleaſant</hi> and taking. (1) He
will adventure to ſuggeſt <hi>good things impertinently,</hi> and unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
as when he puts us upon Praying, while we ſhould be Hearing;
or while we are Praying, he puts into our hearts, things that we
have heard in Preaching: theſe things, (becauſe good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
we are not ſo apt to ſtartle at, but give them a more quick
welcome. (2) He alſo can allure our thoughts, by the <hi>ſtrangeneſs</hi>
of the things ſuggeſted; ſometimes we ſhall have <hi>hints</hi> of things
which we <hi>knew not before,</hi> or ſome <hi>fine</hi> and excellent <hi>notions,</hi> ſo that
we can ſcarce forbear <hi>turning aſide</hi> after them, to <hi>gaze</hi> at them: and
yet when all is done, except we wholly neglect the Duty for them,
they will ſo vaniſh, that we can ſcarce remember them when the
Duty is over. (3) Sometimes he ſuits our deſires and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with the <hi>remembrances</hi> of things that are, at other times, much
in our <hi>love</hi> and affection; and with theſe we are apt to comply:
the pleaſure of them making us forget our preſent Duty. Thoughts
of Eſtates, Honours, Relations, Delights, Recreations, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
elſe we are ſet upon at other times, will more eaſily prevail
for audience now.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He hath a way to betray, and circumvent us, by height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our <hi>own jealouſies</hi> and fears againſt him; and here he <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoots
us in our own bow:</hi> and by a kind of <hi>overdoing,</hi> makes us <hi>undoe</hi>
our deſired work. For where he obſerves us <hi>fearful,</hi> and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
againſt wandring, he doth <hi>alarm</hi> us the more: ſo that (1) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of looking to the <hi>preſent</hi> part of Duty; we reflect upon what
is <hi>paſt,</hi> and make enquiries, <hi>whether we performed that aright?</hi> or
whether we did not wander <hi>from the beginning?</hi> Thus our <hi>ſuſpitions</hi>
that we have miſcarried, bring us into a <hi>miſcarriage:</hi> by this are we
deceived, and put off from minding what we are doing at preſent.
Or (2) an <hi>eager deſire to fix</hi> our thoughts on our preſent Service,
doth amaze and aſtoniſh us into a <hi>ſtupid inactivity,</hi> or into a ſaying,
or doing, <hi>we know not what;</hi> as ordinarily it happens to perſons,
that out of a great <hi>fearfulneſs to offend</hi> in the preſence of ſome
great Perſonages, become <hi>unable to do any thing rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t;</hi> or to behave
themſelves tollerably well: or as an <hi>over-ſteady</hi> and earneſt fixing
the Eye, <hi>weakens</hi> the ſight, and renders the object leſs truly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
to us.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Sometimes the <hi>exerciſe of Fancy</hi> acting or working ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to ſome miſtake which we have entertained; as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49412:90"/>
of performance, doth <hi>ſo hold our thoughts doing,</hi> that we embrace a
cloud or <hi>ſhadow,</hi> when we ſhould have looked after the <hi>ſubſtance.</hi>
I will give an inſtance of this, in reference to Prayer; which (I
have obſerved) hath been a ſnare and miſtake to ſome, and that
is this; Becauſe in that Duty, the Scripture directs us to go to God,
and to ſet <hi>him before us:</hi> therefore have they thought it neceſſary
to frame an <hi>Idea</hi> of God in their thoughts, as of a <hi>perſon preſent</hi> to
whom they ſpeak. Hence their thoughts are buſied, to conceive
ſuch a <hi>repreſentation;</hi> and when the ſhadow of imagination <hi>vaniſheth,</hi>
their thoughts are again <hi>buſied</hi> to enquire, whether their hearts are
upon God? Thus by <hi>playing</hi> with Fancy, they are really <hi>leſs attentive</hi>
upon their Duty.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Satan can lay <hi>impreſſions</hi> of Diſtraction upon Men, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they come</hi> to Religious Services, which ſhall then work, and ſhew
their power to <hi>diſturb,</hi> and divide our hearts; which is by a ſtrong
<hi>prepoſſeſſion</hi> of the heart, with any thing that we fear, or hope, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
or doth any way trouble us: theſe will ſtick to us, and keep
us <hi>company</hi> in our Duties, though we ſtrive to keep them back. And
this was the ground of the Apoſtles advice, to the unmarried per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
to continue in a ſingle life, (times of Perſecution and Diſtreſs
nearly approaching,) that they might <hi>attend upon the Lord without
diſtraction:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 37.</note> implying, that the <hi>thoughtfulneſs,</hi> and more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
carefulneſs, which would ſeize upon the minds of Perſons
under ſuch <hi>ſtraits</hi> and hazards, would unavoidably follow them
in their Duties, and ſo diſtract them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Duties ſpoiled in the performance, by vitiating the Duty.</note> The other way, (beſides this of diſtraction) by which
Satan ſpoils our Duties in the act of performance, is, by <hi>vitiating
Duty it ſelf:</hi> and this he commonly doth three ways.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When he puts Men upon <hi>greater care</hi> for the <hi>outward garb</hi>
and dreſs of a Service, than for the <hi>inward work</hi> of it; he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to make ſome Devotionaries deal with their Duties,<note place="margin">3. Wayes of vitiating the Duty.</note> as the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> did with their Cups, <hi>waſhing</hi> and adorning the <hi>out-ſide,</hi>
while the <hi>inſide</hi> is altogether neglected. Thus the <hi>Papiſts</hi> generally
are for the <hi>outward pomp</hi> and beauty of Services; being only care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that all things ſhould have their external bravery: as the <hi>Tombs</hi>
of the Prophets were <hi>painted</hi> and beautified, which yet were full
of <hi>rottenneſs.</hi> And the generality of Chriſtians more taken up
with this, than with the Service of the heart: <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of this Snare, in the work of Preaching, (where ordinarily
Men cared for <hi>excellency of ſpeech,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2.</note> or <hi>wiſdom)</hi> that he determines
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49412:91"/>
another courſe of Preaching;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2.</note> not <hi>Notions,</hi> or Rhetorick, and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing
words,</hi> but the Doctrine of Chriſt Crucified in <hi>ſincerity</hi> and
<hi>plainneſs.</hi> 'Tis not indeed the outward coſt and fineneſs of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
that God regards;<note place="margin">Jer. 6. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Incenſe from</hi> Sheba, <hi>and the ſweet Cane,
from a far country</hi> are not to any purpoſe, where the heart doth
not moſt deſign <hi>a ſpiritual</hi> Service; for theſe are rather a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the humours of Men, than to pleaſe God: an offering to
themſelves rather than to him. And therefore is it, that what
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> confeſſed they did, <hi>(Chap. 6. 20.)</hi> in buying Incenſe and
the ſweet Cane, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (Chap. 43. 24.) ſeems to deny, <hi>Thou haſt
bought me no ſweet Cane with money;</hi> that is, though thou didſt it,
yet it was to thy <hi>ſelf,</hi> rather than <hi>to me:</hi> I accepted it not, and ſo
was it all one as if thou hadſt not done it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Duties and Services are more apparently vitiated by
<hi>humane additions:</hi> a thing expreſly contrary to the <hi>ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and yet is there a ſtrange boldneſs in Men this way, which
ſometimes riſeth to ſuch an height, that the <hi>plain</hi> and clear Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God are violated, under the ſpecious pretence of <hi>Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Order,</hi> and <hi>Humility;</hi> and nothing doth more take them, than
what they deviſe and find out. Satan knows how diſpleaſing this
is to God, and how great an inclination there is in Men to be
forward in their Inventions, and ſelf-deviſed Worſhip; that he can
eaſily prevail with the incautious. This was the great miſcarriage
of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation all along the <hi>old Teſtament:</hi> and of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi>
who though they declined the Idolatries of their Fathers; yet
were ſo <hi>fond</hi> upon their <hi>Traditions,</hi> that they made their <hi>Worſhip
vain,</hi> as Chriſt tells them. And this humour alſo in <hi>Pauls</hi> time was
inſinuating it ſelf into Chriſtians; managed by a great deal of
deceit, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. and <hi>ſhew of wiſdom, verſ.</hi> 23. which accordingly
he doth earneſtly fore-warn them of. There are indeed ſeveral
degrees of corrupting a Service or Ordinance by humane Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
according to which, 'tis more or leſs defiled: yet, the leaſt
preſumption this way, is an offence and Provocation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Duties are vitiated in their <hi>exceſs. Natural</hi> Worſhip,
which conſiſts in Fear, Love, Faith, Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can never be too
much: but <hi>Inſtituted</hi> Worſhip may, Men may Preach too much,
and Pray too long, (a fault noted by Chriſt in the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> they
made <hi>long Prayers)</hi> even in Duties; a Man may be righteous over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much.
<hi>Timothy</hi> was ſo, in his great pains and over abſtemious
life, to the waſting of his ſtrength, which the Apoſtle takes notice
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49412:91"/>
of, and adviſeth againſt it, <hi>Drink no longer water,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
were ſo, when out of a high deteſtation of the miſcarriage of
the Inceſtuous Perſon, they were backward to forgive him, and to
receive him into the Church again. <hi>Peter</hi> is another inſtance to
us of exceſs; <hi>Jo.</hi> 13. 8. Firſt, in a <hi>modeſt humility,</hi> he refuſeth to
let Chriſt <hi>waſh his feet:</hi> but after, underſtanding the meaning of it,
then he runs to the other extream, and offers not <hi>only his feet,</hi> but

either by the <hi>manner</hi> of the attempt, or in <hi>the Act:</hi> he then ſeeks to

                     <p>Firſt, When he makes us <hi>proud</hi> of them: we can ſcarce perform

thoughts of <hi>Applauſe,</hi> vain Glory, and Boaſting; and we readily
begin to think highly of our ſelves, and performances; as if we
were better than others, whom we are apt to cenſure, as low and
weak in compariſon of our ſelves. Though this be an apparent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
yet 'tis a wonder how much the minds, even of the beſt, are apt
to be tainted with it; even where there are conſiderable <hi>endeavours</hi>

they be <hi>Angels food,</hi> yet (like the <hi>Manna</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when kept

think our ſelves ſecure from him; and as after a full Meal, we are
apt to grow drowſie: ſo after Services, we are apt to think our ſelves
out of harms way.<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 1.</note> The Church after an High Feaſt with Chriſt,

<hi>againſt Duty,</hi> his deſign of <hi>corrupting the Minds
of Men by Errour</hi> calls for our ſearch; and indeed
this is one of his principal endeavours, which
takes up a conſiderable part of his time and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
He is not only called in Scripture an
<hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Spirit,</hi> but alſo a <hi>Lying Spirit,</hi> and there

may conclude that he will certainly ſtrive to blind the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Errour. But a clear diſcovery of this we may have from
theſe Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, From God's intereſt <hi>in Truth,</hi> in reference to his great
deſigns of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> in the World.<note place="margin">Deus eſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma veritas eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentialis, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Dei pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma veritas normalis. <hi>Mac.

Beam of him who is the Father of Lights. All <hi>revealed</hi> Truths
are but <hi>Copies</hi> and Tranſcripts of that <hi>Eſſential, Archetypal</hi> Truth.
Truth is, the <hi>Rod of his Strength,</hi> Pſal. 110. 2. the <hi>Scepter of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
by which he doth ſubdue the hearts of Men to his obedience
and ſervice in converſion. Truth is that <hi>Rock</hi> upon which he
hath <hi>built his Church,</hi> the foundations are the <hi>Prophets and Apoſtles,</hi>
Eph. 2. 20. that is, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Prophets and Apoſtles,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49412:94"/>
in the Scriptures of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> Truth is that
great <hi>depoſitum</hi> committed to the care of his Church, which is
therefore called the <hi>pillar of Truth:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15.</note> becauſe as Princes or Rulers
put their Proclamations on Pillars for the better information of
their Subjects,<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 17.</note> ſo doth his Church hold out Truth to the World.
Holineſs is maintained by Truth, our ways are <hi>directed</hi> by it, and
by it are we <hi>forewarned</hi> of Satan's Devices. Now the <hi>Prince of
Darkneſs</hi> carrying himſelf in as full an oppoſition to the <hi>God of
Truth</hi> as he can in all his ways, God's intereſt in Truth will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
diſcover the Devil's deſign to promote Errour; for ſuch
is his hatred of God, that (though he cannot deſtroy Truth, no
more than he can tear the Sun out of the Firmament, yet) he
will endeavour by <hi>corrupting the Copy,</hi> to <hi>diſgrace the Original;</hi>
though he cannot <hi>break</hi> Chriſt's Scepter, yet by raiſing Errour he
would hinder the <hi>encreaſe</hi> of his Subjects; though he cannot
<hi>remove</hi> the Rock upon which the Church is built, he will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to <hi>ſhake</hi> it, or to <hi>interrupt</hi> the Building, and to <hi>tear down</hi>
God's Proclamation from the Pillar on which he hath ſet it to be
<hi>read of all;</hi> and if we can conceive what an <hi>hatred</hi> the <hi>Thief</hi> hath to
the Light, as it contradicts and hinders his Deſigns, we may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
there is nothing againſt which the Devil will uſe greater
contrivances than againſt the light of Truth: He neither can, nor
will make a <hi>league</hi> with any, but upon the terms that <hi>Nahaſh</hi>
propounded to the Men of <hi>Jabeſh-Gilead,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 11. 3.</note> that is, that he may
<hi>put out their right eye,</hi> and ſo <hi>lay it for a reproach upon the Iſrael of
God.</hi> 'Tis the work of the Holy Spirit <hi>to lead us into Truth,</hi> and by

                     <p>Secondly, Though the Scripture doth charge the <hi>Sin</hi> and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Deluſion and Errour upon thoſe Men that <hi>promote</hi> it, to the
deception of themſelves and others, yet doth it chiefly blame
Satan for the great <hi>Contriver</hi> of it, and expreſsly affirms him to
be the grand Deceiver: Inſtruments and <hi>Engeniers</hi> he muſt make
uſe of to do him ſervice in that work, but ſtill it is the <hi>Devil</hi>
that is a Lying Spirit in their Mouths; 'tis he that teacheth and

                     <p>The Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> among other diſtempers, laboured
under dangerous Errours, againſt which when the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth
induſtriouſly ſet himſelf, he doth chiefly take notice, 1. Of the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49412:94"/>
                        <hi>falſe-Teachers</hi> who had cunningly wrought them up to an apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

<hi>falſe-Apoſtles,</hi> as having no commiſſion from God, and <hi>Satan's
Miniſters,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 13, 15. thereby informing us who it is
that ſends them out and imploys them upon this errand. 2. He
eſpecially accuſeth <hi>Satan</hi> as the great Contriver of all this evil;
if any ſhut their Eyes againſt the Light, he gives this for the
principal cauſe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> that the <hi>God of the World blinded their Minds:</hi> If
any ſtumbled at the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, he preſently blames
the <hi>ſubtilty of the old Serpent</hi> for it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. When falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was directly taught, and varniſhed over with the glorious
pretexts of Truth, ſtill he chargeth Satan with it, <hi>Verſ. 14. No
marvel, for Satan himſelf is transformed into an Angel of Light;</hi>
where he doth not only give a reaſon of the corrupting or the
adulterating the Word of God by falſe-Apoſtles, as <hi>Vintners</hi> do
their Wines by mixtures,<note place="margin">

<hi>cap. 2. 17.)</hi> that they learned it of Satan, <hi>who abode not in the
Truth, but was a Lyar from the beginning:</hi> But alſo, he further
points at Satan, to furniſh us with a true account of the ground
of that cunning Craft which theſe deceitful Workers uſed, while
they <hi>metamorphoſed</hi> themſelves, by an <hi>imitation</hi> of the way and
manner, zeal and diligence of the <hi>Apoſtles of Chriſt;</hi> they were
taught by one who had exactly learned the Art of Imitation,
and who could, to all appearance, act to the life the part of <hi>an
Angel of Light.</hi> And to take away all objection or wonder, that
ſo many with ſuch ſeeming earneſtneſs and zeal, ſhould give up
themſelves to deceive by falſe-Doctrine: he tells us that this hath
been the Devil's work, from the firſt <hi>beguiling of</hi> Eve, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. and
that as he then made uſe of a <hi>Serpent</hi> for his Inſtrument, ſo ever

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

as his Emiſſaries, that it ſhould now neither ſeem a <hi>marvel,</hi> nor
a <hi>great matter</hi> to ſee the Devil at this work by his Agents.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That this is Satan's great deſign, may be further
cleared from the <hi>conſtant courſe</hi> of his endeavours. The Parable
of the Tares, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 25. ſhews, that Satan is as <hi>buſie</hi> in ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Tares,</hi> as the Maſter of the Field is in ſowing <hi>Wheat;</hi> that by
Tares, not Errors in the <hi>abſtract,</hi> but <hi>Men</hi> are to be underſtood,
is evident from the Parable it ſelf; but that which makes <hi>Men</hi>
to be <hi>Tares,</hi> is <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Errour:</hi> ſo that in a <hi>complex</hi> ſenſe, we are
taught how diligent the Devil, (who is expreſsly ſignified by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49412:95"/>
the Enemy, <hi>verſ. 39.)</hi> is in that imployment, much of his time
hath been taken up that way. <hi>There were falſe Prophets</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Epiſt. 2. 1.) and <hi>there ſhall be falſe-Teachers;</hi> that is, ſo
it was of old, and ſo it will be to the end. The ſhorteſt abſtract
of Satan's acts in this matter, would be long and tedious, judge
of the reſt by a few inſtances.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Apoſtles times,</hi> how <hi>quickly</hi> had the Devil broached falſe
Doctrine? That it was <hi>neceſſary to be circumciſed,</hi> was early taught,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. 1. In <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. the vain deceit of <hi>Philoſophy, Traditions,</hi>
and the <hi>Elements</hi> of the World, (which were the body of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi>
Ceremonies) are mentioned as dangerous Intruſions; and
in <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. the <hi>worſhipping of Angels</hi> (as it ſeems) was pleaded
for, with no ſmall hazard to the Church. The <hi>denial of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi>
is expreſsly charged upon ſome of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. and that <hi>the Reſurrection is paſt already, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 18.
is affirmed to have been the Doctrine of <hi>Hymeneus, Philetus,</hi> and
others; but theſe are comparatively little, to that groſs Errour
of <hi>denying Chriſt,</hi> Jud. <hi>v.</hi> 4. or, <hi>that Jeſus is the Chriſt,</hi> 2 Joh. 2. 22.
or, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 3. which are branded
for <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Errours, and were boldly aſſerted by many falſe
Prophets that were then <hi>gone out into the World;</hi> and to ſuch a
height came they at laſt, that they taught the lawfulneſs of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Fornication, and to eat things offered to Idols,</hi> Rev. 2. 20.
All theſe falſehoods took the boldneſs to appear, before all the
Apoſtles were laid in their Graves: And if we will believe what
<hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us from <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Haeres.</note> there were no leſs
than <hi>ten</hi> ſorts of <hi>Heretical Antichriſts</hi> in the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>'s days,
the <hi>Simonians, Menandrians, Saturnilians.</hi> &amp;c. This was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
increaſe of falſe Doctrine in ſo <hi>ſhort</hi> a time, and in the
times and preachings of the <hi>Apoſtles themſelves,</hi> whoſe power and
authority (one would think) might have made Satan <hi>fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them as lightning.</hi> What progreſs then in this work of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
might be expected, when they were all removed out of
the World? They left indeed behind them ſad <hi>predictions</hi> of the
power of deluſion in after-times, <hi>Of your ſelves ſhall Men ariſe,
ſpeaking perverſe things. After my departing ſhall grievous Wolves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Acts 20. 30. The Spirit ſpeaketh expreſsly, that in the
latter times ſome ſhall depart from the Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 1. and
<hi>Paul</hi> (2 Theſſ. 2. 3.) propheſies of a <hi>general</hi> Apoſtacy, upon the
revealing of the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49412:95"/>
that theſe ſhould be <hi>perilous times, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 1. To the ſame purpoſe,
<hi>John</hi> mentions the coming of the <hi>great Antichriſt,</hi> as a thing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
known and believed, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 18. But before all theſe, Chriſt
alſo had fully forewarned his Servants of <hi>falſe-Chriſts,</hi> the power
and danger of their deluſion, and of the ſad revolt from the Faith
which ſhould be before his ſecond coming, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24. And
as we have <hi>heard,</hi> ſo have we <hi>ſeen,</hi> all ages ſince the Apoſtles can
witneſs that Satan hath anſwered the Prophecies that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him: what a ſtrange increaſe of Errours hath been in the
World ſince that time? <hi>Iraeneus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> made Catalogues
long ſince, after them <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> reckoned about
<hi>eighty</hi> Hereſies; <hi>Auſtin</hi> after them brings the number to <hi>eighty
eight.</hi> Now, though there be juſt exceptions againſt the <hi>largeneſs</hi>
of their Catalogues, and that it is believed by many, that there
are ſeveral branded in their Rolls for Hereticks, that meerly ſuffer
upon the account of their <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> (for <hi>Barbariſm, Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſm,
Helleniſm</hi> are muſtered in the Front) and others alſo ſtand
there, for very ſmall matters (as the <hi>quarto decimani,</hi> &amp;c.) and
that ſome ought altogether to be croſſed out of their Books; yet
ſtill it will appear that the number of Errours is great, and that
all thoſe hard names have this general ſignification, that the Devil
hath made a great ſtir in the World by Errour and Opinion;
After times might alſo be ſummoned in to ſpeak their evidence,
and our own knowledg and experience might without any other
help, ſufficiently inſtruct us (if it were needful) of the truth of
this, that Errour is one of Satan's great deſigns.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Let us next look into the Reaſons which do ſo
ſtrongly engage Satan to theſe endeavours of raiſing up Errours.
If we ſet theſe before us, it will not only confirm us in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
that this is one of his main imployments, (for if Errour yield
him ſo many advantages for the ruine of Men, and the diſhonour
of God, there can be no doubt of his readineſs to promote it.)
This alſo may be of uſe to put us in mind, <hi>who it is</hi> that is at
work <hi>behind the Curtain,</hi> when we ſee ſuch things acted upon the
Stage, and conſequently may beget a cautious ſuſpition in our
Minds againſt his proceedings; the Reaſons are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Errour is <hi>ſinful,</hi> ſo that if Satan ſhould be hindred in his
endeavours for any further miſchief, than the corrupting of any
particular Perſon, yet he will reckon, that he hath not altogether
loſt his labour. Some Errours, that overturn <hi>fundamentals</hi> of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49412:96"/>
Faith, are as <hi>deadly poyſon,</hi> and called expreſsly <hi>damnable</hi> by the
<hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1. Theſe Hereſies are by <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 5. 20. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
among the <hi>works of the Fleſh,</hi> of which, he poſitively
affirms, that <hi>they that do ſuch things cannot inherit the Kingdom of
God:</hi> Thoſe that are of a lower nature, that do not ſo <hi>extreamly</hi>
hazard the Soul, can only be capable of this Apology, that they
are <hi>leſs evil;</hi> yet as they are oppoſitions to Truth (propounded
in Scripture for our belief and direction) they ceaſe not to be
Sins, though they may be greater or leſs evils, according to the
<hi>importance</hi> of thoſe Truths which they deny, or the <hi>conſequences</hi>
that attend them; and if we go yet a ſtep lower, to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of thoſe <hi>raſh</hi> and bold aſſertions, about things not <hi>clearly
revealed;</hi> though they may poſſibly be true, yet the poſitiveneſs
of avouchments and determinations in ſuch caſes, where we want
ſufficient reaſon to ſupport what we affirm, (as that of the <hi>Pſeudo-Dionyſius</hi>
for the <hi>Hierarchy of Angels,</hi> and ſome <hi>adventurous</hi> aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concerning God's <hi>ſecret Decrees,</hi> and many other things of
like nature) are by the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. moſt <hi>ſeverely</hi> taxed
for an unwarrantable and unjuſt preſumption, in ſetting <hi>our foot</hi>
upon <hi>God's right;</hi> as if ſuch Men would by violence thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into that which God hath reſerved for himſelf, (for ſo
much the word <hi>intruding</hi> imports,)<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> the cauſe of this he tells us,
is the <hi>arrogancy</hi> of corrupt Reaſon, the <hi>fleſhly Mind,</hi> (ſuitable to
that expreſſion, <hi>Matth. 16. 17. Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed
it;)</hi> the bottom of it is <hi>Pride,</hi> which ſwells Men to this height;
and the Fruit (after all theſe ſwelling attempts) is no other than
(as the Apples of <hi>Sodom)</hi> Duſt and <hi>Vanity, intruding into thoſe
things which he hath not ſeen, Vainly puft up by his fleſhly Mind:</hi> If
then Satan do but gain this, that by Errour (though not diffuſed
further than the breaſt of the infected Party) Truth is <hi>denied,</hi>
or that the heart be <hi>ſwelled</hi> into Pride and Arrogancy, or that he

                     <p>Secondly, But Errour is a Sin of an <hi>encreaſing</hi> nature, and
uſually ſtops not at one or two Falſhoods, but is apt to <hi>ſpawn</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
many others, (as ſome of the moſt <hi>noxious</hi> Creatures have the
moſt <hi>numerous</hi> Broods:) for one Errour hath this miſchievous
danger in it, that it <hi>taints</hi> the Mind to an <hi>inſtability</hi> in every Truth;
and the <hi>bond of ſtedfaſtneſs</hi> being once broken, a Man hath no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
where he ſhall ſtay: as a wanton Horſe once turned looſe,

more <hi>remote,</hi> and by the <hi>long ſtretch</hi> of multiplyed inferences, thoſe
things are <hi>coupled</hi> together that are not very <hi>contiguous.</hi> If the

unneceſſary: this is then a fair mark for the Devil to aim at, if
he prevails for one Errour, 'tis an hundred to one but he prevails
for more.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Satan hath yet a further reach in promoting Errour,
he knows 'tis a <hi>Plague</hi> that uſually infects all <hi>round about,</hi> and
therefore doth he the rather labour in this work, becauſe he hopes
thereby to corrupt others, and infected Perſons are commonly
the moſt buſie Agents (even to the <hi>compaſſing of Sea and Land)
to gain Proſilytes</hi> to their falſe Perſwaſions. This <hi>Harveſt</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
labour, is often noted in Scripture, <hi>they ſhall deceive many,</hi>
Matth. 24. 24. <hi>Many ſhall follow their pernicious ways,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 2.
How quickly had this Leaven ſpread it ſelf in the Church of
<hi>Galatia,</hi> even to <hi>Paul</hi>'s wonder? <hi>Gal. 1. 6. I marvel, that you are
ſo ſoon removed from him, that called you into the grace of Chriſt, into
another Goſpel.</hi> Inſtances of the ſpreading of Errour are frequent.
<hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> roſe about the Year 415, but preſently ſpread it ſelf in
<hi>Paleſtine, Africa, Greece, Italy, Sicily, France,</hi> and <hi>Britain. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſm,</hi>
like fire in Straw, in a little time brought its flame over
the Chriſtian World, and left her <hi>wondring at her ſelf,</hi> that ſhe was
ſo ſuddenly become <hi>Arrian. Socinianiſm</hi> had the like prevalency,
<hi>Laelius</hi> privately had ſowed the Seeds, and after his death <hi>Fauſtus
Socinus</hi> his Nephew did ſo beſtir himſelf, that within <hi>ten years</hi>
(after his confident appearing) whole Congregations in <hi>Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
ſubmitted themſelves to his Dictates,<note place="margin">Conſid. Th. Soc. Proemial. <hi>p.</hi> 65.</note> as <hi>Calovius</hi> affirms, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49412:97"/>
within <hi>twenty</hi> or <hi>thirty</hi> Years more ſeveral <hi>hundreds</hi> of Churches
in <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> were infected, and within a <hi>few Years</hi> more, the
whole <hi>Synod</hi> was brought over to ſubſcribe to <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi> We
have alſo inſtances nearer home, after the Reformation, in the
raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>ſixth,</hi> how ſoon did <hi>Popery</hi> return in its full
ſtrength when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> came to the Crown? which occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Peter Martyr</hi> (when he ſaw young Students flocking to Maſs)
to ſay,<note place="margin">Haec una no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula omnem meam doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam evertit.</note> 
                        <hi>That the tolling of the Bell overturned all his Doctrine at</hi> Oxford.
And of late we have had the ſad experience of the power of Errour
to infect, no Errour ſo abſurd, ridiculous, or blaſphemous, but (once
broached) it preſently gained conſiderable numbers to entertain it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Errour is alſo eminently ſerviceable to Satan for the
bringing in <hi>Diviſions, Schiſms, Rents, Hatreds, Heart-burnings,
Animofities, Revilings, Contentions, Tumults, Wars, and whatſoever
bitter Fruits, breach of Love, and the malignity of Hatred can poſſibly
produce.</hi> Enough of this might be ſeen in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
the diviſions that were amongſt themſelves were occaſioned by it,
and a great number of evils the Apoſtle ſuſpected to have been
already produc'd from thence, as <hi>Debates, Envyings, Wraths,
Strifes, Back-bitings, Whiſperings, Swellings, Tumults, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 20.
He himſelf eſcaped not from being evilly intreated, by thoſe
among them that were turned from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel:
The quarrelſome exceptions that they had raiſed againſt him,
he takes notice of: They charged him with levity, in neglecting
his promiſe to come to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. They called him
<hi>carnal,</hi> one that <hi>walked according to the fleſh,</hi> chap. 10. 2. they
taunted him as a contemptible Fellow, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. They undervalued
his Miniſtry, which occaſioned (not without great Apology)
a commendation of himſelf; nay, they ſeemed to call him a
falſe Apoſtle, and were ſo bold as to challenge him for a <hi>proof of
Chriſt ſpeaking in him, 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 3.</p>
                     <p>If the Devil had ſo much advantage from Errour that was
but in the <hi>bud,</hi> and that in <hi>one</hi> Church only; what may we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
hath he done by it, when it broke out to an open <hi>flame</hi> in
<hi>ſeveral</hi> Churches? What work do we ſee in Families when an
Errour creeps in among them? <hi>the Father riſeth up againſt the
Son, the Son againſt the Father, the Mother againſt the Daughter,
the Daughter againſt the Mother:</hi> what ſad divided Congregations
have we ſeen? what Fierceneſs, Prejudices, Slanders, Evil-ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
Cenſurings, and Diviſions hath this brought forth? what
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49412:97"/>
bandying of Parties againſt Parties, Church againſt Church, hath
been produced by this Engine? How ſadly hath this poor <hi>Iſland</hi>
felt the ſmart of it, the bitter conteſts that have been betwixt
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent,</hi> betwixt them and the <hi>Epiſcopal?</hi>
makes them look more like factious Combinations, than Churches
of Chriſt. The preſent differences betwixt Conformiſts and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts
(if we take them, where they are loweſt) they do
daily produce ſuch effects, as muſt needs be very pleaſing and
grateful to the Devil, both Parties mutually objecting Schiſm,
and charging each other with Crime and Folly; what invectives
and railings may be heard in all Companies? as if they had been
at the greateſt diſtances in point of Doctrine. But whoſoever
loſeth, to be ſure the Devil gains by it. Hatreds, Strife, Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
Emulations, Lyings, Railings, Scorn and Contempt, are
all againſt the known duty of <hi>brotherly kindneſs,</hi> and are undoubted
provocations againſt the God of Love and Peace: What can we
then think of that can be ſo uſeful to Satan as Errour, when
theſe abovementioned evils are the inſeparable products of it?
The modeſteſt Errours that ever were among good Men are ſtill
accompanied with ſomething of theſe bitter Fruits. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
about Meats and Days (when managed with the greateſt
moderation) made the <hi>Strong to deſpiſe the Weak,</hi> as ſilly, wilful,
factious Humoriſts; and on the contrary, the <hi>Weak judged the
Strong,</hi> as prophane, careleſs, and bold Deſpiſers of divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
for ſo much the Apoſtle implyes, <hi>Rom. 14. 3. Let not him
that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth
not, judge him that eateth.</hi> But ſhould we trace Errour thorow
the <hi>ruines</hi> of Churches, and view the <hi>ſlaughters</hi> and bloodſhed that
it hath occaſioned; or conſider the <hi>Wars</hi> and Deſolations that it
hath brought forth, we might heap up matter fit for Tears and
Lamentations, and make you ceaſe to wonder that Satan ſhould
ſo much concern himſelf to promote it.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The greateſt and moſt ſucceſsful Stratagem for the
hindering a <hi>Reformation,</hi> is that of raiſing up an Army of Errours.
Reformation of Abuſes, and corruptions in Worſhip or Doctrine,
(we may well ſuppoſe) the Devil will withſtand with his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
might and Policy, becauſe it endeavours to pull that down
which coſt him ſo much labour and time to ſet up, and ſo croſſeth
his end.<note place="margin">Judg. 5. 18.</note> They who are called out by God to <hi>jeopard their lives in
the high places of the Field,</hi> undertake an hard task in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49412:98"/>
to check the power of the Mighty, whoſe intereſt it is to
maintain thoſe defilements, which their <hi>Policy</hi> hath introduced,
to fix them in the poſſeſſion of that grandeur and command
which ſo highly gratifies their Humours, and ſelf-ſeeking aſpiring
Minds: But Satan knowing the ſtrength of that Power, which
hath raiſed them up to oppoſe, with ſpiritual reſolution, the
current of Prevailing Iniquity, uſually provides himſelf with this
reſerve, and comes upon <hi>their backs</hi> with a <hi>Party</hi> of deluded erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Men raiſed up from among themſelves, and by this means
he hopes either to <hi>diſcourage</hi> the Undertakers for Reformation, by
the difficulty of their work (which muſt needs drive on heavily,
when they that ſhould aſſiſt prove hinderers,) or at leaſt to
<hi>ſtraiten</hi> and limit the ſucceſs: For by this means (1.) He <hi>divides
the Party,</hi> and ſo weakens their hands. (2.) He <hi>ſtrengthens their
Enemies,</hi> who not only gather heart from theſe diviſions (ſeeing
them ſo fair a prognoſtick of their ruine,) but alſo improve them,
by retorting them as an argument, that they are all out of the
way of Truth. (3.) The erroneous Party in the <hi>Rear</hi> of the
Reformers, do more <hi>gall them</hi> with their Arrows (even bitter
words of curſed reviling,) and more hazard them with their
Swords and Spears of oppoſition, than their Adverſaries in the
<hi>Front</hi> againſt whom they went forth. In the mean while, they
that ſtand up for Truth, are as Corn betwixt two Milſtones;
oppreſſed with a double conflict, beſet before and behind.</p>
                     <p>This hath been Satan's method in all ages. And indeed Policy
it ſelf could not contrive any thing that would more certainly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
Reformation than this. When the Apoſtles (who in theſe
laſt days were firſt ſent forth) were imployed to reform the
World, to throw down the Ceremonies of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi>
and Heathen Worſhip, Satan had preſently raiſed up <hi>Men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Minds</hi> to hinder their Progreſs; what work theſe made for
<hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and with the <hi>Galatians,</hi> the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to thoſe Churches
do teſtify. The buſineſs of theſe Men was to draw Diſciples after
them from the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the Goſpel, nay <hi>to another Goſpel;</hi> and
this they could not do but by ſetting up themſelves, boaſting of
the Spirit, carrying themſelves <hi>as the Apoſtles of Chriſt,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
thoſe that were really ſo, inſinuating thereby into the
affections of the ſeduced, as if they <hi>zealouſly affected</hi> them, and
that <hi>Paul</hi> was but <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>contemptible,</hi> nay their very <hi>Enemy for
telling them the truth.</hi> What unſpeakable hindrance muſt this be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49412:98"/>
to <hi>Paul?</hi> What grief of heart? What fear and jealouſie muſt this
produce? he profeſſeth he was affraid leſt he had <hi>beſtowed upon them
labour in vain,</hi> Gal. 4. 11. And that he did no leſs than <hi>travel of
them in birth the ſecond time;</hi> verſ. 19. If <hi>one Alexander</hi> could do
<hi>Paul</hi> ſo much Evil,<note place="margin">2 Tim 4. 24.</note> by <hi>withſtanding his Words,</hi> that he complains of
him, and cautions <hi>Timothy</hi> againſt him. If <hi>one Diotrephes,</hi> by <hi>prating</hi>
againſt <hi>John</hi> with <hi>malicious Words,</hi> prevailed with the Church, that
they <hi>received not him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3 Jo. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.</note> 
                        <hi>nor the Brethren;</hi> What hurt might a Multitude
of ſuch be able to do?</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Primitive</hi> times of the Church, after the Apoſtles days;
when thoſe Worthies were to conteſt with the <hi>Heathen</hi> World, the
<hi>Serpent caſt out of his mouth water, as a flood, after the Woman:</hi> (which
moſt interpret to be a Deluge of Hereſies: And ſome particularly
underſtand it of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie) that he might hinder the
progreſs of the Goſpel. Which deſign of his did ſo take, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
complaints there were, of hindring the Converſion of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
by the Errours that were among Chriſtians. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells
us, That <hi>Pagans</hi> refuſed to come near the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and would not
ſo much as hear them ſpeak, being affrighted by the wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and wayes of the <hi>Priſcilianiſts. Auſtin</hi> complains to the ſame
purpoſe, That looſe, and laſcivious Hereticks adminiſtred matter

                     </p>
                     <p>In after-times, when Religion grew ſo corrupt by <hi>Popery,</hi> that

that Reformation attained not that height and univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which might rationally have been expected from ſuch bleſſed
undertakings. This was the conjecture of many, particularly of
our Country-man, Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> That if theſe <hi>Fanatick Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſts</hi>
(which with ſo great a ſcandal to the Goſpel then brake forth)
<hi>had not retarded and hindred thoſe glorious proceedings; that Apocalyptical
Beaſt of</hi> Rome, <hi>had been not only weakned and wounded, but utterly
overthrown and ſlain.</hi> In particular Cities, where any of the faithful
Servants of Chriſt endeavoured to detect the Errours of <hi>Popery,</hi>
theſe inſtruments of Satan were ready to joyn with the common
Adverſary in reproaches and diſturbances: How they oppoſed <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>

                        </note> you may alſo ſee in their Lives. In all
which, and others of like nature, you will ſtill find, (1) That
there was <hi>never</hi> a Reformation begun, but there were <hi>erroneous</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to <hi>hinder</hi> and diſtract the Reformers. (2) That theſe Men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<hi>as great hatred</hi> againſt the <hi>Reformers,</hi> and oftentimes more,
than againſt the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> and were as ſpitefully bitter in Lies, Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and Scorns againſt them, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Satan can alſo make uſe of Errour, either to <hi>fix</hi> Men
in their preſent miſtaken wayes, and <hi>careleſs</hi> courſe; or as a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> Varieties or Opinions and Doctrines, do amuſe,
and amaze Men; while one cryes, <hi>Lo here is Chriſt,</hi> And another,
<hi>Lo he is there.</hi> Men are ſo confounded, that they do not know
what to <hi>chuſe.</hi> 'Tis one of the greateſt difficulties to <hi>ſingle</hi> out
Truth, from a <hi>croud</hi> of ſpecious confident pretences; eſpecially,
ſeeing Truth is <hi>modeſt,</hi> and oftentimes <hi>out-noiſed</hi> by <hi>clamorous</hi> bold
Errour: yea, ſometimes <hi>out vyed</hi> by the <hi>pretenſions</hi> of Spirit, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
in an Antiſcriptural falſhood. At what a loſs is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
Travellour, where ſo many wayes meet? while one party
cries up this, another that, mutually charging one another with
Errour. They, whoſe hearts are any thing <hi>looſened</hi> from a ſence
and reverence of Religion, are eaſily tempted to <hi>disbelieve</hi> all. Thus
Errour leads to <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> and layes the Foundation for all thoſe
ſlanderous exceptions againſt Scripture, by which Godleſs Men
uſually juſtifie themſelves in their Religion. Now, though all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men are not brought to this, becauſe the Conſciences of ſome,
do ſo ſtrongly retain the ſentiments of a Deity, that all Satans Art
can not obliterate thoſe Characters; yet, the conſideration of the
<hi>multitude</hi> of Errours doth rivet them in the perſwaſion of the
Truth, and goodneſs of <hi>that way</hi> of Religion, wherein they had
been Educated. <hi>Papiſts</hi> are hardned by this; and though they have
no reaſon to boaſt of their <hi>unity</hi> among themſelves, as they have
been often told;<note place="margin">Diſcourſe of the Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </note> and now of late, by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet:</hi> (who hath
manifeſted, that their Diviſions among themſelves, are as great,
and managed with as great Animoſity, as any amongſt us;) yet are
their Ears ſo beaten with the Objection of Sects and Schiſms elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
that they are generally confirmed to ſtay where they are.
Beſides, this is a ſtumbling-block which the Devil throws in the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49412:99"/>
way of poor <hi>Ignorant</hi> People; if they are urged to a ſerious ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in Religion, they are <hi>affrighted</hi> from it, by the conſideration
of <hi>Sects</hi> and parties, and the woful <hi>miſcarriages</hi> of ſome erronious
Perſons, that at firſt pretended to ſtrictneſs; imagining, that ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in Religion, is an unneceſſary dangerous thing; and that the
ſober godly Chriſtians, are but a company of giddy, unſetled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited,
preciſe Perſons, who will in a little time run themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
madneſs and diſtraction; or into deſpair. And thus out of <hi>fear
of Schiſm</hi> or Errour, they dare not be <hi>Religious</hi> in good <hi>earneſt;</hi> but
content themſelves with <hi>drawing near to God with their mouthes,</hi> and
<hi>confeſſing him with their lips, whilſt their hearts are far from him,</hi> and
<hi>in their works they deny him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is ſuch a propenſity in the hearts of Men, to be ſtaggered
by the multitude and boldneſs of Errours, that the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi>

and <hi>Fan,</hi> to purifie and to cleanſe, that <hi>they which are approved,
may be made manifeſt.</hi> The like care he hath, in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19, 20.
upon the mention of the Errour of <hi>Hymeneus,</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> where
he obviateth the offence that might ariſe, by reaſon of their <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy:</hi>
partly by removing the <hi>fears</hi> of the Upright, in affirming
their ſafety, whatever became of other Men, ſeeing <hi>the Foundation
of God ſtandeth ſure:</hi> and partly, by declaring it, no more ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or diſhonourable for God to permit the riſe of Errours in his
Church, than for great Men to have in their houſes, <hi>not only Veſſels
of Gold and Silver, but alſo of Wood and of Earth; ſome to honour,
and ſome to diſhonour.</hi> By theſe very Apologies, it appears, That
Satan by this device of Errour, deſigns to ſhake Mens Faith, and
to drive them from their Religion.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Neither can this, <hi>that corrupt Doctrines bring forth
corrupt Practices,</hi> be of any leſs weight with Satan; or leſs engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for the purſuit of this Deſign, than any of the fore-mentioned
reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Corrupt Doctrines are imbraced as the <hi>very truth</hi> of God by the
Deluded; and one way or other, <hi>directly,</hi> or <hi>conſequentially</hi> they lead
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49412:100"/>
on <hi>Practice;</hi> and that with the higheſt ſecurity, and confidence;
as if they were very Truths indeed.</p>
                     <p>The Devil then hath this great advantage by Errour; That if
he can but corrupt the minds of Men; eſpecially in the more <hi>weighty</hi>
and Fundamental Points of Religion: then by a great eaſe, and
without any more labour, he hath gained them to the <hi>practice</hi> of
whatſoever theſe <hi>corrupted</hi> Principles will <hi>lead</hi> unto. No courſe
can be taken, that with greater expedition and prevalency, can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
profane Debaucheries than this. Thus he conquers <hi>Parties</hi>
and <hi>Multitudes,</hi> as a victorious General takes Cities, and whole
Countries by <hi>Surrender:</hi> whereas his particular Temptations to Sin,
are but inconſiderable, leſs ſucceſsful, <hi>picqueerings</hi> in compariſon:
and when he hath once corrupted the <hi>underſtandings</hi> of Men, he
hath by that means, a command over their <hi>Conſciences;</hi> and doth
not now urge to Evil, in the notion of <hi>a Devil,</hi> or tempter; but
as an <hi>Angel of Light,</hi> or rather as an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> of Divine Authority:
he requires, he commands theſe wicked Practices, as <hi>neceſſary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In perſecutione cogit homines negare Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtam, nunc do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet.</note> or at leaſt, gives a liberty therein, as being harmleſs allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.
This difference was of old obſerved in Satans management
of Perſecution, and Errour; that in the former, he did <hi>compel</hi> Men
to deny Chriſt: but by the latter, he did <hi>teach</hi> them.</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>Lives</hi> and Practices of Men, are ſo concerned by <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Doctrines,</hi> may appear to any, that are but indifferently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Scripture, or Hiſtory. We are told by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 19.</note> That <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſtand ſo related to each other,
that they live and die together; and that when the one is <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracked,</hi>
the other is <hi>Drown'd</hi> for company. In <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 2. he
ſeems ſeverely harſh againſt thoſe of the <hi>Conciſion,</hi> he calls them
Dogs, <hi>Beware of Dogs; beware of evil Workers.</hi> The reaſon of
which expreſſion, (I apprehend) lyes not ſo much in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances,
That Dogs <hi>ſpoyl</hi> the Flock, by <hi>devouring;</hi> or that they
are <hi>fawning</hi> Creatures: or that they are <hi>induſtrious</hi> in proſecution of
their Prey: (though in all theſe particulars, falſe Teachers may
be compared to Dogs; for they ſpare not the Flock, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
Sea and Land, to gain Diſciples, and they intice them with
fair ſpeeches:) but rather, he intends the ſimilitude, to expreſs
the <hi>prophane Life,</hi> and carriage of theſe Seducers; for Dogs are <hi>filthy</hi>
creatures, to a Proverb, <hi>The Dog to his vomit.</hi> And common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes,

from their wicked and abominable Practices. 2. <hi>Pet. 2. 10.

Perſons as the moſt ſcandalous wicked Wretches that we ſhall meet
with: groſly filthy in themſelves, corrupted in all the Duties of
their Relations, natural, and civil; defiled in all the ways of their
converſe with Men.</p>
                     <p>Neither are theſe wicked practices iſſuing from groſs Errours, to
be looked upon as rare, accidental, or <hi>extraordinary</hi> effects thereof,
but as the natural and <hi>common</hi> fruits of them: for Chriſt makes
this to be the very <hi>ſpecial</hi> property and note, whereby falſe Prophets
may be diſcovered. <hi>Matth. 7. 16. Ye ſhall know them by their Fruits:
Do Men gather Grapes of Thornes, or Figs of Thiſtles?</hi> &amp;c. Theſe
Fruits, were not their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> but their <hi>Lives:</hi> (for to know <hi>falſe
Prophets</hi> by <hi>falſe Doctrines</hi> is no more, than to know <hi>falſe Doctrine</hi>
by <hi>falſe Doctrine.)</hi> If any object, That many falſe Teachers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the ſhape of <hi>ſeeming Holineſs,</hi> and ſtrictneſs of Life; they
may be anſwered, from Chriſt's own words: for there he tells us,
(to avoid miſtakes) That their <hi>firſt appearance,</hi> (and it may be the
<hi>whole Lives</hi> of ſome of the <hi>firſt</hi> Seedſ-men of any Errour) is under
the form of <hi>Sanctity: They come to you in Sheeps-cloathing;</hi> In an
outward appearance of Innocency, and plauſible pretences: but
then he adds, that their <hi>Fruits</hi> afterward will diſcover them. A
Tree at its firſt Planting, is not diſcovered what it is; but give
it time to grow to its proper fruitfulneſs, and then you may know
of what kind it is: ſo that we need not affirm, That damnable
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49412:101"/>
Doctrines produce wicked Lives <hi>in all</hi> that entertain them at the
<hi>very firſt;</hi> 'tis enough for diſcovery, if there be a <hi>natural,</hi> conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
tendency in ſuch Doctrines, to <hi>practical Impieties;</hi> or that <hi>at laſt,</hi>
they produce them, though not in all, yet in many.</p>
                     <p>And that this matter hath been always found to be ſo, all Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
doth confirm. Such there were in the Apoſtles dayes, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
by their complaints. Such there were in the Church of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamos,</hi>
Rev. 2. 14. <hi>Thou haſt them that hold the Doctrine of</hi> Balaam;
<hi>who taught</hi> Balak <hi>to caſt a ſtumbling-block before the Children of</hi> Iſrael;
<hi>to eat things ſacrificed unto Idols, and to commit Fornication.</hi> There
were alſo, the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> of whom Chriſt declares his abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.
<hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. In the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> there was the <hi>woman
Jezebel, who taught and ſeduced many</hi> of that Church, to the like
abominable Doctrines and Practices. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. Beſides theſe, the
<hi>Apoſtle John</hi> was troubled with the abominable <hi>Gnoſticks.</hi> The
filthy <hi>Carpocratians,</hi> who taught, That Men <hi>muſt ſin,</hi> and do the
will of all the Devils, or elſe they <hi>could not evade</hi> Principalities
and Powers; who would <hi>no otherwiſe</hi> be pleaſed to ſuffer them to
eſcape to the <hi>Superiour</hi> Heavens. Of theſe Men, and their licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Doctrine doth he ſpeak, 1 <hi>John. 3. 6. &amp;c.</hi> that <hi>they that
are born of God</hi> indeed, muſt not, dare not, <hi>cannot</hi> give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up to a liberty in ſuch Abominations.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Fruits of corrupt Doctrine appeared after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
dayes. What was <hi>Montanus</hi> but an impure wretch? What
were his two companion Propheteſſes, <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> and <hi>Maximilla,</hi> but
infamous Adultereſſes? The <hi>Priſcillianiſts,</hi> the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
more, left the ſtink of their Prophaneneſs behind them; by
reaſon of whom, (according to <hi>Peters</hi> Propheſie, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 2.) the
way of Truth was evil ſpoken of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Later times have alſo given in full evidence of this Truth.
How ſhameful and abominable were the Lives of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi>
and the reſt of thoſe <hi>German Enthuſiaſts?</hi> Who reads the ſtory of
<hi>Hacket,</hi> and <hi>Coppinger,</hi> without deteſtation of their wicked Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
What better have the <hi>Familiſts,</hi> and Libertines of <hi>New</hi> and

all Prophaneneſs of Swearing,<note place="margin">See the Story of Mr. <hi>Copp.</hi>
                        </note> Drinking, Adultery, and the defying
of a godly Life: and this, under the <hi>unreaſonable boaſt</hi> of Spirit
and Perfection. The Heavens may bluſh, and the Earth be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at theſe things! But in the mean time, Satan huggs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his ſucceſs; and encourageth himſelf to further attempts
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49412:101"/>
in propagating Errour, ſeeing it brings in ſo great an harveſt of
Sin.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, In this Deſign of falſe-Doctrine, Satan is never alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
out: if he cannot thus defile their Lives, yet 'tis a thouſand
to one, but he <hi>obſtructs their Graces</hi> by it. What greater hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
can there be to Converſion, than Errour? The word of Truth
is the means by which God, through his Spirit, doth beget us;
'tis part of that Image of God that is implanted in us: 'tis God's
Voice to the Soul, to awaken it. It cannot then be imagined that
God will give the honour of that work to any Errour: neither
can Truth take place, or have its Effect upon a Soul <hi>fore-ſtalled</hi>
with a contrary falſhood. Falſhood in poſſeſſion, will keep Truth
at the door. Neither is Converſion only hindred, by ſuch Errours
as directly contradict converting Truths; but alſo by <hi>Collateral
non-fundamental Errours.</hi> As they fill the Minds of Men with <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi>
againſt thoſe that profeſs another Perſwaſion; ſo that for their
own beloved Errours-ſake, Men will not entertain a warning, or
conviction from thoſe that diſſent from their Opinions: they firſt
account them <hi>Enemies,</hi> and then they <hi>deſpiſe</hi> their Meſſage. 'Tis
no ſmall matter in Satans way, to have ſuch an obſtruction at
hand, in the grand concern of Converſion. Yet this is further
ſerviceable to him, to hinder, or weaken the Graces of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
already: if he can ſet God's Children a <hi>madding</hi> upon Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
or make them fond of <hi>Novelties;</hi> he will by this means <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt</hi>
the vigour and ſtrength of their Hearts; ſo that the <hi>ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi>
of Religion will be neglected. For as hurtful Plants <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs</hi>
all the moiſture and fatneſs of the Earth where they ſtand,
and impoveriſh it into an inability, for the nouriſhment of thoſe
that are of greater worth: So doth Errour poſſeſs it ſelf of the
<hi>ſtrength</hi> of the Spirit; and in the mean time, <hi>neglected</hi> Graces
dwindle into emptineſs, and <hi>fade as a Leaf.</hi> The moſt curious
<hi>Queſtions and</hi> Opinions that are, contribute nothing to the <hi>Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of the Heart; 'tis only Grace that doth that. <hi>Heb. 13. 9.

nay, they do Grace a prejudice, in that they make it <hi>ſick</hi> and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing:

                     <p>Ninthly, Errour hath yet another miſchief in it, which makes
it not a little deſirable to Satan; and that is the <hi>judgment,</hi> or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49412:102"/>
that it brings. So that it every way anſwers the Devils ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
againſt both Soul and Body. The bleſſings of <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi>
do attend the Triumphal Chariot of <hi>Truth.</hi> Pſal. 85. 11, 12. <hi>Truth
ſhall ſpring out of the Earth, and Righteouſneſs ſhall look down from
Heaven.</hi> And then it follows, That <hi>the Lord ſhall give that which is
good, and our Land ſhall yield her increaſe.</hi> But on the contrary,
Errour doth more <hi>provoke</hi> God than Men are aware. How often
did God deſolate the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſet a fire in their Cities, and gave
them into the hands of their Enemies, becauſe of their changing
the Truth of God into a lye; and worſhipping and ſerving the
<hi>Creature more than the Creator?</hi> God left not the Church of <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi>
and <hi>Thyatira</hi> without ſevere Threatnings for the Errour of
the <hi>Nicolaitans.</hi> Rev. 2. 16. <hi>Repent, or elſe I will come unto thee
quickly.</hi> Verſ. 22. <hi>I will caſt them into great tribulation, except they
repent of their Deeds, and I will kill her children with death.</hi> And
accordingly, God fulfilled his threatning upon them, by bringing
in the <hi>Saracens</hi> to deſolate them, and to poſſeſs their Land: as he
alſo brought the <hi>Goths</hi> upon the <hi>Empire,</hi> for the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie.
How is Satan pleaſed to labour in a Deſign that will kindle the

                     <head>CHAP. II. Of the Advantages which Satan hath, and uſeth, for the
Introduction of Errour. As, (1.) From his own Power
of Spiritual Faſcination. That there is ſuch a Power,
proved from Scripture, and from the Effects of it.
(2.) From our imperfection of Knowledge; the particulars
thereof explained. (3.) From the byaſs of the Mind.
VVhat things do byas it; and the power of them to
ſway the Underſtanding. (4.) From Curioſity. (5.) From
Atheiſtical Debauchery of Conſcience.</head>
                     <p>THat Satan may the better ſpeed in his deſign, he carefully
takes notice of, and diligently improves all advantages.
Indeed all his Stratagems are advantages taken againſt us, (for
ſo the Apoſtle in his caution to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> calls his devices,
leſt Satan ſhould get an <hi>advantage</hi> of us, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 11.)</hi> but here, I
only underſtand thoſe that are more <hi>general,</hi> which are the grounds
and encouragements to his particular Machinations againſt Men,
and which alſo direct him in his procedure. Theſe are</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Satan's own power of <hi>Spiritual Faſcination,</hi> by which he
infatuates the <hi>minds</hi> of Men, and deludes them, as the <hi>external
ſenſes</hi> are deceived by Inchantments or <hi>Witchcraft.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Satan is a cunning Sophiſter, and can put Fallacies upon
the Underſtanding; that by ſubtile objections or arguments he
can obtrude a falſhood upon the belief of the unskilful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary;
that he can betray the judgment by the affections, are
things of common practice with him. But that which I am now
to ſpeak of, is of an higher nature, and though it may (probably)
take in much of his common method of ordinary deluſion, yet in
this it differs, (at leaſt) that 'tis more <hi>efficacious</hi> and prevalent;
for as his power over the children of diſobedience is ſo great
that he can <hi>lead them captive at his will,</hi> (except when he is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanded
by the Almighty,) ſo hath he (by ſpecial commiſſion)
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49412:103"/>
a power to lead thoſe to Errour <hi>effectually,</hi> (without miſſing his
end) that have prepared themſelves for that ſpiritual judgment
by a ſpecial provocation; and for ought we know, as he hath
an <hi>extraordinary power</hi> which he exerts at ſuch times, ſo may he
have an <hi>extraordinary method</hi> which he is not permitted to practiſe
daily, nor upon all.</p>
                     <p>That ſuch a power as this the Devil hath, is believed by thoſe,
whoſe learning and experience have made their judgments of
great value with ſerious Men; and thus ſome do deſcribe it, <hi>'Tis

not only from the <hi>authority</hi> of learned Interpreters, who appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Apoſtle and his expreſſion to intend more, but alſo from
ſome <hi>concomitant</hi> particulars in the Text. He calls them <hi>fooliſh
Galatians,</hi> as we tranſlate it, but the Original goes a little higher,
to ſignify a <hi>madneſs;</hi> and withall, he ſeems to be ſurprized with
<hi>wonder</hi> at the Power of Satan upon them, which had not only
prevailed againſt the <hi>Truth,</hi> but againſt ſuch <hi>evident</hi> manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                     <p>Next to this, let us a little conſider that famous Scripture, in
2 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 9, 10, 11. Whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all
Power—and for this cauſe, God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions,
that they ſhould believe a lye</hi>—. I ſhall from this place obſerve
a few things, which if put together, will clear the truth we ſpeak
of: As firſt, In this deluſion here mentioned, the Apoſtle doth
not only ſet down <hi>extraordinary outward</hi> means, (as <hi>Signs,</hi> and
<hi>Lying Wonders)</hi> but alſo ſuits theſe extraordinary means with a
ſutable concomitant <hi>inward power;</hi> for, <hi>by Power</hi> I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
(as ſome) a power of ſhewing Signs,<note place="margin">Piſcator <hi>&amp;</hi> Sclator.</note> and doing Wonders,

                        </gap>, <hi>with
the power of Signs and Wonders,</hi> for the words will not well bear
that without ſome unnatural ſtraining: but I underſtand by it,
a Power <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the Signs and Wonders by which he moves
their hearts to believe, by an <hi>inward working</hi> upon their minds,
<hi>ſtriking in</hi> with the <hi>outward means</hi> of Lying Miracles propounded
to their ſenſes.<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> And we may the better ſatisfy our ſelves in this
interpretation, if we compare it with <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 19. where not
only the power of doing Wonders is expreſſed by a phraſe,

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49412:104"/>
mighty Signs and Wonders,</hi> or in the power of Signs and Wonders,
but it is alſo <hi>clearly diſtinguiſhed</hi> from the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
God in working upon the hearts to make thoſe Wonders effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and perſwaſive; ſo that, as in the Spirit of God we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a Power <hi>to do Wonders,</hi> and a Power to <hi>work upon the Heart</hi>
by theſe Wonders, we may conclude that this wicked Spirit hath
alſo (in order to Sin and Deluſion) this <hi>twofold</hi> Power.<note place="margin">

                           </gap>.</note> But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
I note further, that this Power is called a <hi>ſpecial energy</hi> of
peculiar force and efficacy in its working, the ſtrange inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtrength of it ſeems to ſtand in need of many words for expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:

                           <gap reason="foreign">

height, as the <hi>variety</hi> of its operations,) and then the <hi>energy,</hi> the
virtue, operativeneſs and ſtrength of Power. Thirdly, 'Tis alſo
to be obſerved that Satan's ſucceſs and exerciſe of this Power of
Deluſion depends upon the <hi>commiſſion of God,</hi> and that therefore
'tis <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and not permitted to him but upon ſpecial
occaſions and provocation, <hi>for this cauſe God ſhall ſend,</hi> &amp;c.
Fourthly, The <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of this Power when exerciſed, is <hi>certain.</hi>
They are not only ſtrong deluſions in regard of the <hi>Power</hi> from
whence they come, but alſo in regard of the <hi>event,</hi> thoſe upon
whom they come cannot but believe.<note place="margin">Sclater <hi>in</hi> loc.</note> 
                        <hi>Infatuation</hi> and <hi>Pertinaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
are the certain fruits of it. Fifthly, The Proof of all is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
in the <hi>quality</hi> of the Errours entertained, for they are pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
groſs <hi>lyes,</hi> and yet believed as the <hi>very truths of God,</hi> and
they are in ſuch <hi>weighty</hi> points as do evidently determine the
Soul to ruine, <hi>lies to be damned,</hi> which two things are ſufficient
proofs of Spiritual faſcination. It being unimaginable that
rational Men (and eſpecially ſuch as were inſtructed to a belief
of a contrary truth) ſhould ſo far degenerate from the light of
Reaſon, as to be deluded by groſs and <hi>apparent</hi> Lyes, and of ſuch
<hi>high importance,</hi> except their minds had been <hi>blinded</hi> in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
way. Some further confirmation may be added to
this truth from 1 <hi>King. 22. 21. And there came forth a Spirit and
ſtood before the Lord, and ſaid, I will perſwade him—I will go
forth, and I will be a lying Spirit in the mouth of all his Prophets,
and he ſaid, thou ſhalt perſwade him, and prevail alſo.</hi> I might here
take notice of Satan's <hi>readineſs</hi> in this work, as wanting neither
skill nor will, if he were but always furniſhed with a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
as alſo the powerful <hi>efficacy</hi> of Spiritual Witchcraft, where

Spirit in the mouth of the Prophets:</hi> which neceſſarily, (as <hi>Peter

to fix upon their <hi>Imaginary Faculty,</hi> the <hi>Species,</hi> Images, or
Characters of what was to be ſuggeſted, that he could not only
make them apprehend, what he <hi>preſented</hi> to their minds; but alſo,
make them <hi>believe,</hi> that it was a <hi>Divine Inſpiration,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true: for theſe falſe Prophets did not ſpeak <hi>hypocritically,</hi>
what they knew to be falſe, but what they confidently apprehended
to be true; as appears by the whole ſtory. (2) He could <hi>irritate,</hi>
and inflame their deſire to <hi>publiſh</hi> theſe their Perſwaſions to the
King, after the manner of Divine Prophecies. (3) He had a
further power of perſwading <hi>Ahab,</hi> that his Prophets <hi>ſpake
Truth.</hi>

                     <p>If any yet further enquire, how he can do theſe things? We

<hi>Gal. 5. 3. This Perſwaſion cometh not of him that called you:</hi> that

                     <p>
                        <hi>From all theſe Scriptures, then it appears, That this Spiritual
Faſcination,</hi> is a Power in Satan which he exerts, by ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49412:105"/>

unable to diſcern betwixt Truth, and a Lye; and ſo by darkning their
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, they are effectually perſwaded to believe an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is yet another proof of this Spiritual Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
from the conſideration of the <hi>Effects</hi> of it upon the
Deluded: and the uncouth, ſtrange unnatural way of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.
Let all particulars of this kind be put together, and it
will not be found poſſible to give any other rational accompt of
ſome Errours, than that of extraordinary Deluſion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Let us take notice of the <hi>vileneſs</hi> and odiouſneſs of ſome
Errours that have prevailed upon Men; ſome have been plainly
<hi>ſottiſh;</hi> ſo evidently fooliſh, that it cannot be imagined, that Men
that entertained them, had at that time the uſe of Reaſon, or
any competent Underſtanding. This very conſideration, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> inſiſts upon largely, <hi>Chap.</hi> 44. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.
Where he taxeth them ſmartly, for the ſenceleſs doltiſhneſs of
their Errour, in Worſhiping Idols: he tells them, the <hi>matter</hi> of
it is the Work of Nature; a <hi>Cedar, Oak,</hi> or <hi>Aſh,</hi> that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(poſſibly) had planted, and the Rain did nouriſh it. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14.
He tells them alſo, That the <hi>form</hi> of it, was from the Art of the
Workman, the <hi>Smith,</hi> or <hi>Carpenter. Verſ. 12, 13. The Smith with
the Tongs, both worketh in the Coals, and faſhioneth it with Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
and worketh it with the ſtrength of his Arms.—The Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſtretcheth out his Rule, he marketh it out with a Line, he fitteth it
with Planes, and he marketh it out with a Compaſs.</hi>—He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
minds them, that without any reverence, they make uſe of
the reſidue of the Materials; out of which, they formed their
Idol to common ſervices of dreſſing their meat, and warming
themſelves; <hi>He burneth part thereof in the Fire, with part thereof
he eateth Fleſh, he roaſteth roaſt, and is ſatisfied; yea, warmeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſaith, Aha, I am warm, I have ſeen the fire.</hi> Verſ. 16. Then
he accuſeth them of Sottiſhneſs; in that, the <hi>reſidue thereof he
maketh a God, even his graven Image, he falleth down to it, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipeth
it, and prayeth unto it, and ſaith, Deliver me, for thou art my
God,</hi> verſ. 17. And from all this he concludes, That ſeeing this
is ſo directly contrary to common reaſon and underſtanding,
(which. in the ordinary exerciſe of it, would eaſily have freed
them from ſuch a dotage: for if they had but <hi>knowledge or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
to ſay, I have burnt part of it in the fire; I have baked
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49412:105"/>
bread, and ſhall I make the reſidue an abomination?—Verſ.</hi> 19. They
could not have been ſo fooliſh,) it muſt then, of neceſſity, be a
Spiritual Infatuation. <hi>Their Eyes were ſhut that they cannot ſee, and
their Hearts, that they cannot underſtand</hi>—Verſ. 18. <hi>A deceived heart
hath turned him aſide</hi>—Verſ. 20. Other Errours there are, that

the <hi>ſober</hi> Principles of Man-kind, the <hi>natural</hi> Principles of Modeſty,
the moſt <hi>general</hi> and <hi>undoubted</hi> Principles of Religion, and Holineſs.
As when Adulteries, Swearing, Ranting, going Naked, Cruelties,
Murthers, outragious Confuſions, and Madneſs, are cloathed with
<hi>pretences</hi> of Spirit, Revelation, <hi>freedom</hi> in the uſe of the Creature,
<hi>exerciſe</hi> of Love, and having <hi>all things common,</hi> &amp;c. (Of which,
ſad inſtances have been given more than once.) Let any ſober
Man conſider, how it could come to paſs, That Men that have
<hi>Reaſon enough</hi> to defend them againſt ſuch Furies, and the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

common reaſon would teach them to abhor: 'tis more than ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
that 'tis not any <hi>probability</hi> of Truth, or <hi>excellency</hi> in the
Errour, that prevails with them: but, a <hi>Spiritual Power</hi> that doth
bewitch them. When we conſider, that ſuch a Learned Man as
<hi>Tertullian</hi> begins to admire ſuch a wretch as <hi>Montanus;</hi> or ſuch an
one as <hi>Arthington,</hi> led away with <hi>Hacket</hi> and <hi>Coppinger,</hi> or ſuch a
Man as <hi>Kneperdollin,</hi> ſeduced by <hi>John of Leyden;</hi> and eſpecially,
ſuch numbers of wiſe, and ſeemingly <hi>ſober and Religious</hi> perſons
going down the ſtream, after <hi>irrational</hi> and plainly <hi>irreligious</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours;
what elſe can be apprehended to be the cauſe, but a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Satanical Deluſion?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Add we to theſe, the conſideration of the <hi>ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of the prevalency of ſuch Errours, againſt plain and evident
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49412:106"/>
Truths, (which is a circumſtance taken notice of by the Apoſtle.
<hi>Gal. 1. 6. I marvel that ye are ſo ſoon removed from him that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
you into the Grace of Chriſt, unto another Goſpel.)</hi> In which caſe
we may obſerve, it uſually falls out, That Mens <hi>Affections</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their <hi>Diſcoveries,</hi> at the firſt view they are taken, before they
underſtand what the Errour is; and they are <hi>perſwaded before they
know.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly and Laſtly, That the <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> of the proſecution, by
which they maintain, and propagate the Errour, is a kind of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
fury,</hi> which hurries Men with violence into an unyielding
ſtifneſs, to the ſtifling of all kind of Charity, and Conſideration.
Theſe things put together, (I ſay) makes the matter in hand evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
when Men, otherwiſe <hi>rational,</hi> are at <hi>firſt touch, highly</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured
with, and <hi>violent</hi> in the purſuit of Errours, that are <hi>ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,</hi>
or <hi>devilliſh;</hi> we can reſolve it into nothing leſs, than into that
of the Apoſtle, <hi>Who hath bewitched you?</hi> The improvement of
this firſt, and great advantage for the introduction of Errours, is
more than can be well expreſſed; but he hath beſides, other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which he no way neglects: among which,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Our <hi>Imperfection in Knowledge,</hi> is none of the leaſt;
if our Knowledge had been perfect, it would have been a task too
hard for the Devil, to make us Erroneous; for Men do <hi>not err,</hi>
but ſo far as they are <hi>ignorant:</hi> to impoſe upon Men againſt clear
and certain Knowledg is impoſſible. Men cannot <hi>believe</hi> that to
be <hi>true,</hi> which they <hi>know</hi> to be <hi>falſe.</hi> It would be as ſilly for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
to make ſuch attempts, as for a Jugler to endeavour the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of thoſe, that know and ſee the ways of his Conveian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as well as himſelf. That our Knowledg is imperfect, I ſhall
prove and explain in the following particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Scripture plainly aſſerts it, the greateſt number of
Men (which are in an <hi>unregenerate</hi> Eſtate) are expreſly called, <hi>fooliſh,</hi>
blind, ignorant, Men that are in Darkneſs, Men that do not know,
nor conſider, that periſh through Ignorance. Others, that (in
compariſon to theſe) are called <hi>Children of the Light;</hi> and ſuch as
<hi>ſee with open face,</hi> are notwithſtanding (when compared to a ſtate of
Perfection) repreſented to be in the <hi>Non-age</hi> of their Knowledg,
unripe, imperfect; the Apoſtle doth ſo expreſs it, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 9.
We know in part, we propheſie in part.</hi> In the Explanation of this,
he compares our attainments in this World, to the <hi>underſtanding,
thoughts,</hi> and <hi>ſpeakings</hi> of Children, <hi>v.</hi> 11. concludes <hi>v.</hi> 12. That
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49412:107"/>
all our knowledg, gives us but a dark imperfect reflection of
things; <hi>we ſee through a Glaſs darkly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Men that have had the <hi>cleareſt heads,</hi> and have been
at the greateſt <hi>pains</hi> in their enquiries to find out Truths, have
brought back the clear <hi>conviction</hi> of their own Ignorance.<note place="margin">Plura neſcio quam ſci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <hi>Epiſt. 119. c. 21. Melch. Adam</hi> in vita.</note> 
                        <hi>Auſtin</hi>
confeſſeth, That in the Scriptures, (which he made his chief
ſtudy) the things <hi>which he knew not, were more than the things he
underſtood. Chytraeus,</hi> in humble Modeſty goes a little further, <hi>My
deareſt knowledg</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is to know, that I know nothing:</hi> and it
will be a clear demonſtration of that Mans ignorance, that boaſts
of his Knowledg; his own mouth will prove againſt him, that
<hi>he knows nothing as he ought to know.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The conſideration of the <hi>Nature</hi> of the things, which
are the Objects upon which we employ our ſearch, will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
convince us, that we do comprehend but very little. For
though the Scripture hath expreſſed the <hi>main concerns</hi> of eternal
Life ſo fully, that they are as <hi>clear as Light,</hi> and need no ſuch ſtretch
of the Brain, but that the meaneſt capacities may as certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
them, as they underſtood any thing of common buſineſs;
as, <hi>That Chriſt dyed for Sinners; that without Faith it is impoſſible
to pleaſe God;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                        </note> 
                        <hi>that without Holyneſs no Man ſhall ſee his face,</hi> &amp;c.
Yet, (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 16.) There are many things that are
hard to be underſtood;</hi> there are Difficulties, Depths, and Myſteries.
Some things (whereof we have but dark touches in Scripture;
though enough to let us know, that ſuch things there are; and
to humble us for our ignorance) are, in their <hi>own nature,</hi> ſublime,
bounded on all ſides with Rocks, and Praecipices, where our near
and bold approaches are prohibited: ſuch are thoſe things, that
concern the Decrees of God, the Trinity, &amp;c. Other things are
dark and uncertain to us, from their very <hi>proximity</hi> to us (as ſome
are pleaſed to fancy the reaſon;) ſuch are the nature, faculties,
and workings of our own Souls within us: which we cannot <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi>
ſee, (as the Eyes ſees not it ſelf) and do but as it were gueſs
by dark <hi>reflections.</hi> Some things in Scripture are <hi>accidentally</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
<hi>to us,</hi> that were <hi>plain</hi> to thoſe that heard them <hi>firſt,</hi> to whom
they were ſpoken, and written: for now, to the underſtanding
of a great many paſſages, there is neceſſary the <hi>knowledg of the
Tongues,</hi> in which they were dictated, of <hi>the Hiſtories</hi> of thoſe times
to which they ſeverally related; as alſo, of the particular <hi>Cuſtoms</hi>
of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, which gave a <hi>mold</hi> and form to a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49412:107"/>
Scripture Aſſertions: all which are eaſie, and familiar to thoſe
that knew the exact propriety of ſuch Languages, were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
throughly with ſuch Hiſtories Cuſtoms, Uſages, and manner
of Speakings: and beſides all theſe, the <hi>application</hi> of <hi>general Rules,</hi>
to <hi>particular</hi> Caſes, (where a little circumſtance may make a great
alteration,)<note place="margin">D'<hi>Eſpagne</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Errours. §. 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.</note> is full of puzzle and intricacy. Inſomuch, that ſome
have thought, that there are <hi>ſeveral</hi> caſes of Conſcience, that are
not yet <hi>fully</hi> determined, and that are like ſo to remain.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Neither is the <hi>nature of Knowledg</hi> it ſelf, without an
Argument to prove, the inſufficiency of our Knowledg; to Know,
is properly to underſtand things by their <hi>Cauſes;</hi> or at leaſt, by
their <hi>Effects:</hi> and to make a right <hi>reſult</hi> of Particulars from a
general Maxim. Such a kind of Knowledg, is neceſſary in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
for ſetting aſide, ſome particulars of <hi>myſterious</hi> height,
(about which, God hath ſet bounds, leſt Men in preſumptuous
boldneſs ſhould adventure to <hi>break through unto the Lord to gaze.)</hi>
And ſome things which are the <hi>Principles of Nature,</hi> or their <hi>next
reſults,</hi> (which are upon that ſcore, beyond all need of enquiry,)
in all which, 'tis enough to believe, that what the Scripture ſaith
is true, without asking a further account: yet in other things,
the Scripture gives us the <hi>Grounds, Reaſons,</hi> and <hi>Proofs</hi> of what it
declares, or aſſerts; as may appear by infinite Examples: ſo that
to know <hi>Chriſt dyed,</hi> or that we are <hi>juſtified by Faith,</hi> or that <hi>Chriſt
ſhall come to Judgment;</hi> without a knowledge of the <hi>grounds,</hi> and
reaſons of theſe things, is indeed but <hi>groſs ignorance.</hi> The like
may be ſaid, of the Knowledg of general Precepts, without the
Knowledg of their neceſſary Application.</p>
                     <p>But how few are there that do thus know? the greateſt part
of Men ſatisfie themſelves with the bare affirmations of Scripture,
and they reſolve all into this, That the <hi>Word of God ſaith ſo:</hi> or,
<hi>That it is the Will of God it ſhould be ſo,</hi> without further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
                     <p>And as for others, though they may know the Reaſons of
many things, yet are there a vaſt number of Particulars, whoſe
reaſons we <hi>know not,</hi> though the Scripture may contain them:
and as for Conſequences, and the <hi>application</hi> of general Rules, their
juſt <hi>limitation,</hi> and the <hi>Enumeration</hi> of the Caſes wherein they are
<hi>true,</hi> or <hi>falſe:</hi> it is that that keeps the Wits of Men upon the <hi>rack</hi>
perpetually.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The <hi>unſuitableneſs</hi> of our Capacities, to thoſe <hi>Objects</hi>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:49412:108"/>
of Words, we have but a <hi>mole-hill</hi> of ſubſtantial Matter. Nay,
ſeeing we make but a ſorry ſhift, at beſt, by theſe Artifices to
come to ſome <hi>rude conceptions</hi> of things, which otherwiſe we
cannot in any tolerable manner comprehend; it is as great a
<hi>proof</hi> of our imperfection in Knowledg, as the neceſſary uſe of
<hi>ſtaves and crutches</hi> is an evidence of <hi>lameneſs.</hi> If I ſhould paſs
from this, to the conſideration of the Multitude (beyond all num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
of <hi>Books</hi> that are written, we ſhall find them but ſo many
<hi>Proclamations</hi> of our Ignorance; for if we could believe <hi>them all</hi>
to contain ſo many wholſome Precepts of <hi>neceſſary</hi> Truth (which
yet we cannot rationally imagin) this would imply, That the
<hi>greateſt part wanted</hi> theſe informations; and that common Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is not only a <hi>general diſtemper,</hi> but alſo a Diſtemper <hi>hard</hi> to
be cured, that ſtands in need of ſuch <hi>Multitudes</hi> of Inſtructors,
and ſuch <hi>varieties</hi> of helps. But if we believe, that among this
infinite number of Volumes there are <hi>thouſands of Lyes,</hi> millions
of unproved <hi>Conjectures,</hi> millions of millions of idle unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Fancies;</hi> then do we in expreſs terms pronounce them guilty
of Ignorance, and of Ignorance ſo much the more <hi>dangerous,</hi> by
how much the more <hi>bold</hi> it is, to avouch it ſelf in the Light,
and to obtrude it ſelf upon the belief of others, who inſtead of
being better informed by it, ſhall but encreaſe their own blindeſs:
were there nothing to be ſaid but this, That there are ſuch a vaſt
multitude of <hi>Commentators</hi> upon the Bible, which do all pretend
to expound and explain it, it would of neceſſity admit of theſe
Concluſions. (1) That the Bible hath in it things ſo <hi>dark</hi> or at
leaſt, our <hi>capacities</hi> are ſo <hi>dull,</hi> that there is need of great endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to explain the one, or aſſiſt the other. (2) That the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of Men is <hi>imperfect:</hi> for if all, or moſt Men could <hi>certainly
interpret</hi> the Scripture, there needed not ſo many Volumes, but
that <hi>one, or two</hi> might have ſignified as much, as now whole <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries</hi>
can do.</p>
                     <p>The imperfection of our Knowledg, being thus laid open, 'tis
eaſie to ſee, what advantages the Devil may make out of it, for
the promoting of Errour; for it muſt now become our wonder,
not that <hi>any Man errs,</hi> but that <hi>all do not.</hi> We find it eaſie to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
any thing upon Children, 'tis an eaſie matter for a trifle to
cheat them out of all they have. Surely then Satan may do as
much by Men, who are but <hi>Children in underſtanding.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 14. puts us in mind of this hazard, under that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49412:108"/>
ſimilitude, <hi>That we henceforth be no more Children toſſed to and
fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine.</hi> How fitly doth
he reſemble us to Children? Their weakneſſes are, (1) Want
of <hi>diſcerning,</hi> they ſee not the true worth of things. (2) <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity,</hi>
they believe all fair ſpeeches, and ſpecious Promiſes;
and the hazard of both theſe is in this, That it makes them <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant,
uncertain,</hi> and <hi>fickle;</hi> and ſuch are we made by our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
ſo <hi>little</hi> do we truly diſcern, ſo apt are we to <hi>believe</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pretence (for <hi>the ſimple believes every word,</hi>

<hi>Feather</hi> in the Wind.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A third advantage which the Devil takes againſt us
in his deſign of Errour, is the <hi>byaſs</hi> of the Mind; were our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
purely free, in a juſt and <hi>even ballance</hi> toward all things
propounded to its deliberation and aſſent, (though it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
in its Light) the danger were the leſs; but, now in
regard of the <hi>bent</hi> and ſway it is under; 'tis commonly <hi>partial,</hi>
and inclined to one ſide more than to another, and yet the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
were the leſs, if only <hi>one or two</hi> noted things had the power
of ſetting up a falſe-Light before the Mind; but there are many
things that are apt to do us this miſchief, which have the <hi>ſame</hi>
Effect upon us, that <hi>bribes</hi> have upon perſons intereſted in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which not only tempts them to do wrong, but ſo blindes
their eyes, that they know not they do ſo, or at leaſt, not in ſo
great a meaſure. The Mind is byaſſed.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Naturally</hi> to <hi>Errour,</hi> rather than Truths; the corruption of
our Nature is general, and doth not only diſpoſe the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
to <hi>practical</hi> iniquities, but doth alſo incline the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi>
to <hi>Errour</hi> and miſapprehenſion. And that ſeems to be the ground
of Chriſts aſſertion againſt the <hi>Jews; Jo. 5. 43. I am come in
my Fathers Name, and ye receive me not; if another ſhall come in his
own name, him ye will receive.</hi> Which implies, That Men are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
more prone to believe an <hi>Impoſter,</hi> than one that ſpeaks
the moſt certain and profitable Verities: and beſides this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
inclination to vanities and lyes, there are (if ſome think right)
ſome Errours that are <hi>formally</hi> engraven in the <hi>nature of faln Man;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">D'<hi>Eſpagne</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Errours. §. 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</note>
as that Opinion, <hi>To be ſaved by Works.</hi> For not only do all Men
(that have any apprehenſions of a future Eternal State) reſolve
that queſtion of obtaining Salvation into Works, as the proper
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49412:109"/>
Cauſe, (and indeed no other could have been imagined, if the
Scripture had not revealed the Redemption by the Blood of Jeſus.)
But the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Jo.</hi> 6. 28. (When they propound that Queſtion,
<hi>What ſhall we do, that we might work the works of God?)</hi> take
it for granted, That Works (of ſome kind or other) are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Happineſs. Poſſibly ſome impreſſion of that Notion (while
it was a Truth, as in the ſtate of Innocency it was,) may yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
upon our Natures, though by the Fall, the Caſe is altered
with us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Mind is byaſſed by <hi>bodily temper,</hi> and <hi>complectional
inclination;</hi> the varieties of Complections, introduce varieties of
Humours, and Diſpoſitions: and the Underſtanding (being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to look through theſe, as ſo many <hi>coloured glaſſes,)</hi> is
apt to judge, (that is to miſ-judge) according to the miſ-repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Objects.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Sometimes <hi>habitual acquirements</hi> have the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the Underſtanding, that Natural humours have.
The Arts and Sciences we ſtudy, our ways of Education and
Imployment, are but ſo many <hi>prejudicate praepoſſeſſions</hi> that do ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
taint the Mind.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There are alſo <hi>accidental inclinations,</hi> which (though
not cuſtomary) have the force of a ſecond Nature, becauſe their
working is violent and impetuous, and theſe which are from a
<hi>wounded Conſcience,</hi> or <hi>exceſſes</hi> of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> have a byaſs more
than ordinary; they lay violent Hands upon the Underſtanding,
and with a mighty Torrent run it down. So that if an Errour
be offered, that is ſuitable to ſuch fears, or miſapprehenſions, it
can ſcarce miſs of ſucceſs. The extraordinary <hi>turbulencies</hi> of ſome
other Paſſions; as Anger, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have the like Effect.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Vitious Habits</hi> do ſo much byaſs the Mind, that the
Underſtanding muſt needs be defiled by them. Nothing can more
prepare the Mind to a <hi>wicked Errour,</hi> than a <hi>wicked Life.</hi> An
Errour of <hi>Indulgence</hi> (being ſo grateful to Corruption) may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
find favour with the underſtandings of thoſe that <hi>know not
to do good,</hi> becauſe <hi>they have accuſtomed themſelves to do evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, There are <hi>External things</hi> that have no leſs power on
the Underſtanding, than any of the fore-going; and theſe are <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,
Education,</hi> and <hi>Intereſt;</hi> theſe ſtick ſo cloſe, and work ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
that though there are few that are not (in diſputable caſes)
<hi>influenced</hi> by them, yet none are able, or willing to take notice,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49412:109"/>
                        <hi>how,</hi> and by <hi>what ſteps</hi> they do engage them to paſs Sentence
againſt Truth. And indeed, that Man muſt have a ſingular
meaſure of ſuſpicious Watchfulneſs, and clear Integrity, that is
not deceived by them. And the beſt way to keep clear of the
miſchief that theſe may do us, <hi>is to be ſevere in our ſuſpitions, on
that ſide to which Cuſtom and Intereſt have their tendencies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seventhly, I might Note, that there is ſomething conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to this purpoſe, in the <hi>nature of Spirits.</hi> Some Spirits are
<hi>unfixed,</hi> and <hi>volatile;</hi> and theſe are ſoon altered by their own <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteadineſs.</hi>
Others are <hi>tenacious</hi> and unflexible; and if ſuch be firſt
ſet wrong, 'tis not an eaſie thing that will reduce them to Truth.
Others are <hi>ſoft and ductile,</hi> perſwaded by <hi>good words</hi> as ſoon as
<hi>ſtrong arguments.</hi> And again, ſome are of ſuch a rough, ſowre,
<hi>contradictious temper,</hi> that they will ſooner chuſe to run wrong, than
comply with the perſwaſions of thoſe that offer Truth, even
for that reaſon, <hi>becauſe they are perſwaded to it;</hi> ſo that the Truth
which (if none had minded them) they of themſelves would have
embraced, they will now refuſe when 'tis preſſed upon them, out
of a croſs and thwarting humour, becauſe they hate nothing
more <hi>than to do as they are bidden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To come a little nearer, Let us conſider how theſe things ſhew
their Power upon the Mind, to ſway and incline it. 'Tis indeed
true, That in things that are <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>ſtrongly</hi> propounded to
the Underſtanding, it cannot but judg according to the evidence
of Truth; and cannot be guided by the Will, to judg contrary:
nay, the Will (though in things purely <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> it may retain
its <hi>averſeneſs;</hi> as alſo in things <hi>Practical,</hi> while they are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
only, as what <hi>may</hi> be done, before the Underſtanding hath
come up to its <hi>final reſolve,</hi> determining, that ſuch things <hi>muſt,</hi> or
<hi>ought</hi> to be done) cannot but follow the <hi>light</hi> and information of
the Underſtanding,<note place="margin">Tantum quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que vult, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum intelligit ſe velle debere.</note> and that according to the <hi>Proportion</hi> of its
Conviction; ſo that though in ſome Caſes, a Man would have
things otherwiſe than he believes them to be: yet, he cannot
believe <hi>what he will,</hi> neither can he <hi>refuſe</hi> to will what is <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
repreſented to be good and neceſſary. Notwithſtanding all
this, the fore-mentioned Particulars may ſo byaſs the Mind, that
it ſhall not act truly and ſteadily; as we may ſee in theſe <hi>three</hi>
Particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In things <hi>clearly</hi> demonſtrated to the Underſtanding;
though the Will cannot <hi>directly</hi> oppoſe, nor prevail to have them
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49412:110"/>
judged falſe,<note place="margin">Intellectus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem quoad exercitium, non quoad ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificationem.</note> yet it can <hi>indirectly</hi> hinder the procedure of the
Underſtanding, and divert it from fixing its <hi>conſideration</hi> upon the
Truth; or from working it ſelf into <hi>poſitive determinations,</hi> for
bringing it into Practice. Thus, many that cannot but believe
there is a God, and that his Law is true; being byaſſed by
their Luſts, the power of Pleaſures, or Intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do prevail
upon their underſtandings, to take up <hi>other Objects</hi> of conſideration;
ſo that they are ſaid to forget God, and to caſt his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
behind their backs: as alſo, not to remember their latter-end,
though they cannot but believe, that they ſhall dye. Truth may
be <hi>impriſoned,</hi> and fettered, where it cannot be <hi>ſlain.</hi> We read
of <hi>holding the Truth in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. Which was
this, That thoſe <hi>Heathens</hi> (of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks) by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their vitious Inclinations and Practices; though they could
not obliterate thoſe notices of Equity and Religion that were
imprinted on their Minds; yet, they kept them at under, (as
Captives in a Dungeon) and ſuffered them not to riſe up in a
juſt practical improvement. Now the wrong that is done to
Truth this way, is not only, by rendring it <hi>unfruitful</hi> and uſeleſs
at preſent, but hereby the Devil hath his advantage in the <hi>gaining
of time,</hi> to gather together <hi>more</hi> Forces againſt that Truth; and
by frequent onſets of <hi>contrary</hi> Arguings; (eſpecially upon the
advantage of the Minds <hi>indifferency,</hi> and remiſſneſs, begot by
long and often Diverſions,) to ſet <hi>another face</hi> upon it, and by
degrees to over-turn former Perſwaſions. This was the very
Caſe of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> in the place laſt cited; who being firſt
<hi>ſwayed</hi> by their Impieties, became unwilling to give way to thoſe
Dictates of Light and Juſtice which they had; and having thus
gratified their Luſts, the Devil further prevailing with them, to
find <hi>evaſions</hi> from the power of thoſe Truths, they began to
make <hi>unſuitable Inferences</hi> from theſe Premiſes, which they could
not deny, and ſo became <hi>ſottiſh</hi> and <hi>vain</hi> in their reaſonings,
<hi>changing the glory of the uncorruptible God, into an Image made like
unto corruptible Man.</hi> And by ſuch practices againſt Truth,
they at laſt <hi>changed the Truth into a Lye,</hi> verſ. 25. and at long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
<hi>obliterated</hi> the knowledg of God out of their Minds. This
is Satan's old Method of over-turning Truth at laſt, by divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Mind from receiving the preſent powerful Impreſſions
of thoſe Principles.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But in things doubtful, where there is not a clear
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49412:110"/>
certainly, what is Truth? but contrary Opinions ſtrive with ſuch
<hi>equal confidence,</hi> that 'tis difficult to determine which hath the
<hi>Conqueſt;</hi> there the Mind may be ſo ſwayed by its byaſs, that it
may give <hi>approbation</hi> to Errour: nay, where upon a fair and <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
tryal,</hi> Truth hath the <hi>greater appearance</hi> of ſtrength; and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
nothing elſe, than little <hi>ſhadows</hi> or appearances of Reaſon
to ſhelter it ſelf under; yet, that way may the mind be inclined
by the aforeſaid things. We have a more <hi>eaſie</hi> and facile belief
for what we <hi>would have,</hi> than for what we <hi>would not.</hi> Though
there is nothing more noted by common experience than this,
that Men are uſually drawn aſide by Humours, Inclinations, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
and Education, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to judg well of that which an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced
perſon would eaſily ſee to be weak, unjuſt, ridiculous,
or unreaſonable: yet, how theſe conſiderations and tempers do
<hi>exert</hi> their force upon the Underſtanding to draw it into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance;
or by what <hi>ſecret Art</hi> they can <hi>heighten</hi> Probabilities, and
<hi>leſſen</hi> Objections; or by what <hi>inſenſible progreſs</hi> they move, that
Men thus carried do not perceive that they are under ſuch a
force, is not ſo very diſcernible. How often may we obſerve,
Men (that are rational enough, to diſcover the pitiful ſhifts, and
poor allegations of others,) with ſuch <hi>gravity</hi> and confidence
(where their own <hi>Intereſts</hi> are concerned) to offer ſuch <hi>low</hi> reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and <hi>extravagant</hi> impertinences, that all that hear them,
are ready to laugh at their folly; and yet they themſelves enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
no leſs than perſwaſions of the <hi>invincibleneſs</hi> of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?
they ſo eagerly deſire what they would eſtabliſh, that they,
think any thing is enough to juſtifie it; and are apt to imagine that
their ſhifts and excuſes appear <hi>as ſtrong</hi> to others, as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
I have known ſome, that by the ſway of <hi>Intereſt,</hi> have
changed their Opinions in Religious Matters, and have really
become otherwiſe perſwaded, than they had been formerly, (and
not as ſome, who for advantage will <hi>knowingly</hi> take up what they
cannot believe to be true,) and have not been able to ſay, That
they have met with <hi>new</hi> Arguments, or <hi>new</hi> Anſwers to Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but, I know not how, Arguments, which they had <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
and laid by for weak, began to look <hi>big</hi> upon them: the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
by which their former Perſwaſion was upheld, grew
inſenſibly <hi>feeble</hi> in their hands; the one <hi>revived,</hi> gathered ſtrength,
after they had a little cheriſhed them, by thinking there might
be ſomething in them, though before they <hi>knew</hi> all the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49412:111"/>
and could not inſtance in any thing which they had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
notified and anſwered; and the other ſort of Arguments
grew <hi>weaker</hi> and weaker, till at laſt they parted with all good
conceit of them; ſo that ſuch a change was but as the <hi>turning
of the Tables:</hi> that which acted behind the <hi>Curtain,</hi> and wrought
this change of the <hi>Fancy,</hi> could be no other than ſome of the
forementioned things that byaſſed their Mind; for where the
<hi>Arguments, pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> were the <hi>ſame,</hi> the <hi>alteration</hi> of Opinion
(where Men are not ſo wicked as to go directly againſt their own
Light,) muſt of neceſſity be imputed to the <hi>different poſitions</hi> of
external things, and the <hi>different humours</hi> and inclinations begot
by them: Even as the <hi>different ſtations</hi> of Men in the proſpect of
ſome Pictures, repreſent them <hi>variouſly,</hi> one way they give the
ſhape of a beautiful face; another way, they expreſs the ugly
deformity of a Devil: or as <hi>different reflections</hi> of the Sun-beams
upon the ſame Object, cloath it with <hi>ſeveral colours.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth alſo give us notice of this advantage which the Devil
takes from the inclinations of Men, to lead them into miſtakes.
That of <hi>Mic. 2. 11. (If a man walking in the Spirit of falſhood,
do lye, ſaying, I will propheſie unto thee of Wine, and of ſtrong-drink,
he ſhall even be the Prophet of this People)</hi> hath this for
its Foundation, that let the Errour be never ſo groſs and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
(as if a Man ſhould propheſie a liberty for Drunkenneſs,)
if it be ſuitable to the <hi>ſway of peoples humours,</hi> it will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough be embraced, <hi>He ſhall be a Prophet to this People:</hi> that
is, ſuch a Prophet will eaſily prevail with ſuch a People, their
vitious inclinations fit them for any impreſſion of a ſuitable Errour.
The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo found this too true in the Hereſies of his
own times: for he tells us, That Seducers had learned that
cunning from the Devil, to draw Men to Errour, by the ſway of
their <hi>Luſts; 2 Tim. 3. 6. They creep into houſes, and lead Captive
ſilly Women laden with Sins, and led away with divers Luſts.</hi> As
alſo, 2 Tim. 4. 6. He propheſies of the future uſe of this Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem;
<hi>After their own Luſts ſhall they heap to themſelves Teachers.</hi>
So that the uſual prevalency of Errour, was, and is, from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ground-working
of Luſts, Humours, Habits, and Inclinations;
which make Men willing to entertain an Opinion, which can
but gratifie them with a ſuitableneſs, or fitneſs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Where the fore-mentioned Particulars of Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
natural, or acquired Humours, Cuſtom, Education, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49412:111"/>
neither <hi>divert</hi> the Underſtanding, nor <hi>engage</hi> it to cloſe with Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
yet, often do they diſcover, how powerfully they can byas
the Mind, in that theſe prevail with Men, to <hi>modifie and mold a
Truth according to the bent, or form of their inclinations.</hi> As a Bowl
which is skilfully aimed at a <hi>Mark,</hi> goes nevertheleſs by a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs</hi>
which its byas forceth it unto, according to the riſings or
fallings of the ground it meets with in the way. Men may arrive
at real Truth in the main, and yet may <hi>ſhape</hi> it according to their
<hi>humours.</hi> For inſtance, let us conſider the different <hi>modes</hi> or forms,
in which the <hi>ſame Truth</hi> is repreſented under the workings of
<hi>different</hi> tempers. A <hi>Melancholy</hi> Perſon conceives of all things
under ſuch <hi>reflections,</hi> as Fear and Sadneſs do uſually give; if he
conſider God he looks upon him in the notion of <hi>greateſt ſeverity
and juſtice:</hi> if upon the ways of <hi>Duty,</hi> he colours them all <hi>in black,</hi>
and can ſcarce account any thing <hi>Piety,</hi> which is not accompanied
with <hi>ſadneſs</hi> and <hi>mourning;</hi> if he calls his <hi>Soul</hi> to a reckoning,
his concluſions concerning himſelf are <hi>ſad,</hi> doleful, or at beſt <hi>ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</hi>
On the contrary, an <hi>hilarous</hi> cheerful temper, cenſures all
<hi>ſadneſs</hi> for <hi>fullenneſs,</hi> and is apt to accuſe thoſe that go mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their way, for <hi>unthankful Murmurers,</hi> and <hi>unbelieving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainers;</hi>
it interprets God's favourable <hi>condeſentions</hi> to the weak,
in the greateſt <hi>latitude,</hi> and is eaſily perſwaded to thoſe things
that are upon the <hi>utmoſt brink</hi> of Liberty: to which, others of a
<hi>more timerous</hi> diſpoſition dare not <hi>approach,</hi> for fear of offending.
This puts an higher excellency upon the duties of <hi>Praiſe,</hi> as
the other upon <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Mourning.</hi> Thoſe Men that are <hi>moroſe</hi>
and ſevere, they are apt to think, that <hi>God is ſuch an one as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi>
and though they acknowledg there is ſuch a grace as
Charity, yet under a pretence of <hi>ſtrictneſs,</hi> they cannot believe they
are bound to exerciſe it towards any that are under <hi>any failing,</hi>
of which they judge themſelves to be free; and therefore ſuch
Men are uſually very <hi>difficult,</hi> in all caſes wherein Condeſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to be uſed; they are hard to be <hi>reconciled,</hi> and after the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
of any perſon, are not <hi>eaſily ſatisfied</hi> of their Repentance:
and in caſes of <hi>Diſſent</hi> from their way and practice of Religion,
they are commonly <hi>cenſorious,</hi> and conclude the worſt. They again
that are naturally <hi>mild and gentle,</hi> under a pretence of Charity and
Meekneſs, are apt to become <hi>remiſs</hi> in their Carriages towards
any Brother; and becauſe <hi>Charity thinks not evil,</hi> they <hi>model</hi> their
acknowledged Duty into the form of their <hi>own diſpoſition,</hi> and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49412:112"/>
ſo think they <hi>muſt ſee, and yet not perceive;</hi> and inſtead of cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>infirmities</hi> of a Brother, they have a Mantle to caſt over
every <hi>tranſgreſſion.</hi> At the ſame rate alſo do they frame their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of <hi>God,</hi> as if he was ſo <hi>merciful,</hi> that he would ſcarce
reckon any Abomination to be above the height of an <hi>ordinary
infirmity:</hi> theſe are apt to think, that the <hi>mercies</hi> of God (ſo much
praiſed in Scripture) ſignifie <hi>little leſs</hi> than an <hi>indulgence</hi> in Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
far above what <hi>Preciſians</hi> are apt to imagine: and that it
is as <hi>eaſie</hi> to obtain <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> from God for any offence, as it is
to ſay, <hi>The Lord be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi> Thoſe that accuſtom
themſelves to the <hi>delights of the ſenſes,</hi> are apt to bend the <hi>way</hi> of
their Religion to that <hi>humour;</hi> and think, that nothing can be <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi>
in Worſhip, that is not ſet out with <hi>garniſhings</hi> that may
pleaſe the Eye, or Ear. Nay, 'tis obſervable enough, That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
borrows ſome <hi>taint</hi> or <hi>ſhape,</hi> from the various <hi>Studies</hi> and
<hi>Sciences</hi> of Men; in ſome, (as in many of the <hi>Fathers)</hi> we may ſee
Religion dipt in <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> or <hi>Peripateticiſm.</hi> Some introduce
the <hi>diſtinctions</hi> and <hi>definitions</hi> of Philoſophy; others compel all
Scriptures to ſubmit to the Laws of ſtrict <hi>logical Analyſis.</hi> Thus,
according to the various <hi>Mediums</hi> that Men look through, are
Truths diſcoloured, and dreſſed up in ſeveral ſhapes: 'tis eaſie
from theſe inſtances to imagine, that Satan muſt have a great
advantage againſt us in point of Errour, from the byas of the
Mind.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Adventurous Curioſities</hi> is another general advantage
by which he works. This ariſeth partly from a <hi>deſire</hi> of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and partly <hi>from Pride;</hi> and both theſe make way for his
Deſign.</p>
                     <p>A deſire after Knowledg is Natural,<note place="margin">Divinum eſt ſcire quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plurima.</note> and withal very bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
To know hath ſomething in it more than ordinary. This
is noted in <hi>Job 11. 12. Vain Man would be wiſe, though Man be
born like a wild Aſſe's-colt:</hi> though he be fooliſh, yet he <hi>affects</hi> Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and the very delight of Knowing, doth engage Men to
<hi>curious prying Searches,</hi> though with much labour and hazard.
Of this Temper were the <hi>Athenians,</hi> Act. 17. 21. <hi>They ſpent their
time in nothing elſe, but either to tell, or to hear ſome new thing:</hi>
not barely in telling News, but in inquiries after <hi>new Notions</hi>
and Diſcoveries: and this made them willing to hear <hi>Paul,</hi> as
<hi>a ſetter forth of ſtrange Gods,</hi> and a <hi>new Doctrine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When this deſire after Knowledg is animated with Pride,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49412:112"/>
(as oft it is, for <hi>Knowledg puffeth up)</hi> then 'tis more dangerous;
when Men are upon a Deſign, to ſeem higher than others, to
be <hi>ſingular,</hi> to ſee more, than what all Men ſee, to be admired,
to out-talk their Neighbours, what <hi>adventures</hi> will they not make?
How fair do they lye open to any conceit that may ſerve this
end?</p>
                     <p>That Satan labours to improve this curioſity, is without doubt;
he carefully affords fuel to this burning, and diligently blows it
up into a flame. The firſt temptation had that ingredient in it,
<hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</hi> And we ſee it was
a great enticement to <hi>Eve, That which would make one wiſe,</hi> was
therefore deſirable. The blame of <hi>Iſraels</hi> firſt Idolatry, ſeems
to be laid at this door, <hi>Deut. 32. 17. They ſacrificed—to Gods
whom they knew not, to new Gods that came newly up:</hi> implying,
That they were drawn aſide from their old eſtabliſhed way of
Worſhip, by a curioſity, to <hi>try the new ways</hi> of the <hi>Heathens.</hi> And
ſo great an hand hath this, generally, in Errours; That <hi>Paul,
2 Tim.</hi> 4. 3. makes this itch after Novelty the great ground of
that defection from Truth,<note place="margin">Pluritus ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſt ſcabies Eccleſiarum.</note> which he foreſaw was coming, <hi>They
ſhall heap to themſelves Teachers, having itching ears.</hi> This <hi>itch of
the Ear,</hi> is the uſual fore-runner of a <hi>Scab in the Church,</hi> becauſe
it doth diſpoſe Men to receive any <hi>kind</hi> of Teacher. God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
doth ſometimes take the advantage of our <hi>natural curioſity</hi>
for our <hi>good:</hi> by this means many of <hi>Johns</hi> Hearers, who went
out into the Wilderneſs to him, as to a <hi>ſtrange ſight</hi> (as thoſe
words imply, <hi>What went ye out into the Wilderneſs to ſee?)</hi> were
Converted. By this means, the Goſpel afterwards made a large
Progreſs, as we ſee commonly <hi>new Teachers</hi> affect moſt at <hi>firſt,</hi>
for when Men grow acquainted with their Gifts, their admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
decays, and the ſucceſs of their Labours is not ſo great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times. The Devil alſo obſerving, the prevalency of Curioſity;
and that Men are more pleaſed with <hi>new Notions,</hi> than with
<hi>old Truths;</hi> he endeavours alſo to Plow with this Heifer, and oft
makes a great Harveſt by it. There is yet another advantage
more that he ſometimes uſeth: and that is,</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Atheiſtical Debauchery,</hi> when Men by long cuſtome in
Sinning, have arrived to habitual Careleſneſs and Preſumption,
then they become <hi>Practical Atheiſts;</hi> their <hi>Vitious Habits</hi> work
upon their Underſtandings, to <hi>obliterate all Principles:</hi> when
Men are gone ſo far, they are fit Engineers for Satan; for while
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49412:113"/>
they diſ-believe all things, they can (to ſerve a <hi>Deſign,</hi> or to head
a <hi>Party)</hi> take up any <hi>Opinion,</hi> and pretend the greateſt ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the propagating it; though in the mean time, they <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
laugh</hi> at the credulity of the Vulgar.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Men <hi>let out themſelves,</hi> and all their parts to the Devil,
and he knows how to make uſe of them, to bring on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,
and deception of others. Many Ages have given Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of ſuch: thoſe Seducers mentioned in the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi>
were (ſome of them) of <hi>this rank,</hi> and therefore called <hi>deceitful
Workers.</hi> Such as were not <hi>really</hi> under thoſe Perſwaſions, which
they thought to ſix upon others; but upon <hi>deſign, transformed
themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt; ſuch as ſerved not our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, but their own bellies:</hi> and yet <hi>by good words and fair
ſpeeches, deceived the hearts of the ſimple,</hi> Rom. 16. 18. Who,
<hi>through Covetouſneſs, with feigned words, made Merchandize</hi> of
Men, 2 Pet. 2. 3. <hi>Balaam</hi> was ſuch, and the <hi>Woman Jezabel that
called her ſelf a Propheteſs,</hi> Rev. 2. 20. Such was the <hi>Arch-biſhop</hi>
of <hi>Spalato,</hi> who for advantage could at pleaſure take up, and lay

                     <head>CHAP. III. Of Satan's improving theſe Advantages for Errour. 1. By
deluding the Underſtanding directly: which he doth
(1.) by countenancing Errour from Scripture. Of
his cunning therein. (2) By ſpecious pretences of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries;
and what theſe are. Of perſonal flatteries.
(3.) By affected Expreſſions. Reaſon of their preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.

if managing that deſign. (6.) By pretended Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
(7) By pretended Miracles. His cunning here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
(8) By peace and proſperity in ways of Errour.
(9) By lyes againſt Truth, and the Profeſſors of it.</head>
                     <p>WHat are the <hi>general Advantages</hi> which Satan hath to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his deſign of Errour we have ſeen. It now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
that we take an account of the various ways, by
which he improves thoſe Advantages, and thoſe may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>two</hi> Heads. (1) They are ſuch Stratagems, as more <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recty</hi>
work upon the Underſtanding to <hi>delude</hi> and blind it. Or
(2) they are ſuch as <hi>indirectly</hi> by the power of the <hi>Will</hi> and
<hi>Affections</hi> do <hi>influence</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Thoſe Stratagems, that more immediatly concern the
Underſtanding, are the uſe of ſuch <hi>Arguments,</hi> which carry in
them a <hi>probability</hi> to confirm an Errour; though indeed they are
but <hi>Fallacies, Sophiſms,</hi> or <hi>Paralogiſms:</hi> of which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks,
<hi>Col. 2. 4. Leſt any beguile you,</hi>—that is, leſt they impoſe upon
you, by <hi>falſe Reaſonings.</hi> His uſual way of proceeding in this

profeſſion and belief of Scripture; he is then careful to give an
Errour ſome countenance or pretence from <hi>Scripture:</hi> it is not his
courſe to <hi>decry</hi> the Scriptures with ſuch Men, but to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> their
Truth and Authority, as the moſt plauſible way to his Deſign:
for by this means he doth not only <hi>prevent</hi> a great many ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
objections, which would otherwiſe riſe up againſt him, (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men brought up with Scripture, cannot eaſily be brought to
call them falſe,) but with conſiderable advantage, he doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>authorize</hi> and juſtifie his Errour: for nothing can give more
boldneſs or confidence to a miſtake, then a belief that it is
backed with Scripture.</p>
                     <p>That this is one of his grand Stratagems, may be ſufficiently
evinced from the infinite number of Errours that pretend to
<hi>Scripture warrant.</hi> Thoſe that are above, or beyond Scripture,
(which acknowledg no dependance upon it) are but few, and
rare: and indeed, among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Errour cannot well thrives
without a pretence of Scripture. Men would have enough to
do to perſwade <hi>themſelves</hi> to ſuch Errours, but it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to make a <hi>Party</hi> or perſwade others; ſuch Errours would
preſently be hiſſed out of the World. Upon this account is it,
that <hi>Atheiſm ſculks</hi> and conceals it ſelf, (except where generally
tolerated Prophaneneſs gives it more than ordinary encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,)
which is not to be aſcribed to any <hi>ſhame-faced modeſty,</hi>
that <hi>Atheiſms</hi> can be ſuppoſed to nouriſh; but to the <hi>generall diſlike</hi>
of others, who ſo ſtick to the Authority of the <hi>Bible,</hi> that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
all direct contradictions to it with great abhorrency. Hence
alſo it is, that ſome Erroneous perſons are forced to <hi>contradictions</hi>
in their <hi>practice</hi> againſt their profeſſed <hi>Principles,</hi> becauſe they find
it impoſſible to propagate their Errours, without ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
or other to Scripture. They that would undermine thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Records, are forced to make uſe of their Authority for proof
of what they would ſay. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> have a <hi>quarrel</hi> at them, and
envy them the title of <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Perſpicuity,</hi> upon deſign to
intoduce <hi>Traditions,</hi> and to ſet up the <hi>Popes</hi> Judicial Authority in
matters of Faith; and when they have ſaid all they can, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the Scriptures to the <hi>Popes</hi> Determination, they are forced at
laſt to be beholden to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to prove the <hi>Popes Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:</hi>
they would prove the <hi>Scriptures</hi> by the <hi>Church;</hi> and then
the <hi>Church</hi> by the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> which is a <hi>Circle</hi> they have been often
told of, and of which, ſome of the wiſer ſort among themſelves
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49412:114"/>
are aſhamed. Others alſo, that will not allow the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to
be a <hi>general ſtanding Rule,</hi> are yet forced to make it (in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes)
a <hi>Rule</hi> to <hi>themſelves,</hi> and eagerly plead it to be ſo to <hi>others.</hi>
They that pretend to be <hi>above Ordinances,</hi> and decry <hi>outward-Teachings</hi>
as unneceſſary, or hurtful: yet, they <hi>Teach outwardly,</hi>
becauſe they ſee they are not able to enlarge the <hi>Empire</hi> of Errour,
without ſuch teaching. Thoſe very Errours that make it their
chief buſineſs, to render the <hi>Scriptures</hi> no better than <hi>an old Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack;</hi>
they yet ſeek to <hi>Scripture</hi> to countenance their Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Aſſertions; and if they get any ſcrap or ſhred of it, that
may by their <hi>unjuſt Torture</hi> be wreſted to ſpeak any ſuch thing,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note>
or any thing toward it, they think all their follies are thereby <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized;</hi>
and commonly, ſuch Men either fix upon ſuch places as
give warning of the neceſſary <hi>concomitances</hi> of the Spirit, and
<hi>Heart,</hi> with the outward <hi>Act</hi> of ſervice; (and from hence, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
what God hath joyned together, they ſet up <hi>Spiritual</hi>
Sabbaths, <hi>Spiritual</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>Spiritual</hi> Worſhip, to cry down, and
caſhier the <hi>external Acts</hi> of ſuch Ordinances:) or they pretend
<hi>kindred</hi> to <hi>Scripture,</hi> as propheſying, or foretelling thoſe <hi>new</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations
which they <hi>are about to ſet up.</hi> Let <hi>H. Nicholas</hi>
be an inſtance of this, who though he decryed the Service of the
<hi>Law</hi> under God the Father, and the Service of the <hi>Belief</hi> under
Chriſt; and in the room of both theſe, would ſet up another
Adminiſtration, under the Spirit; yet, (that he might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
believed) he applyed ſeveral <hi>Scriptures</hi> to his purpoſe, as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically</hi>
foretelling <hi>H. Nicholas,</hi> and his ſervices; and would have
Men imagine, that he was <hi>that Angel flying in the midſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with the Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> Rev. 14. 6. <hi>And that Prophet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after by the Jews,</hi> Joh. 1. 21. <hi>Art thou that Prophet,</hi> and
<hi>that Man ordained to Judg the World?</hi> Act. 17. 31. And that
the times of his Diſpenſation, were the times of Perfection, and
Glory ſpoken of in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. The like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
for new Adminiſtrations had <hi>Saltmarſh,</hi> and ſeveral
others.</p>
                     <p>Satan fixing his Foot upon this Deſign, and taking advantage
of Mens Ignorance, Curioſity, and Pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is impoſſible to tell
what he may do; he hath introduced many Hereſies already,
and none knows what may be behind; many paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are <hi>dark,</hi> to the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> of Men: a great many more are ſo
to the <hi>common</hi> ſort of Chriſtians. A great many wits are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49412:115"/>
by him, as <hi>Adventurers</hi> for <hi>new Diſcoveries;</hi> and a ſmall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is ground enough for a bold Undertaker to erect a new
Notion upon; and a new Notion in Religion, is like a new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
in Apparel, which bewitcheth the unſteady with an itch to
be in it, before they well underſtand what it is: So that 'tis alike
impoſſible to <hi>ſtint</hi> the juſt <hi>number</hi> of Errours, as to <hi>adjuſt</hi> the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>pretences</hi> from Scripture upon which they may be countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
Leaving therefore this task to thoſe that can undertake it,
I ſhall only note a particular or two of Satans cunning in affixing
an Errour upon Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In any grand deſign of Error, he endeavours to lay the
<hi>Foundation</hi> of it as <hi>near to Truth</hi> as he can; but yet ſo, that in the
<hi>tendency</hi> of it, it may <hi>go as far from it</hi> as may be. As ſome Rivers
whoſe firſt <hi>Fountains</hi> are <hi>contiguous,</hi> have notwithſtanding a direct
<hi>contrary</hi> courſe in their Streams. For inſtance, in thoſe Errors that
tend to overthrow the doctrine of the Goſpel, concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi>
and <hi>Ordinances</hi> (and theſe are things which the Devil hath a great
ſpite at) he begins his work with plauſible pretences of <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Admiration</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Grace;</hi> he proceeds from thence to the
pretence of <hi>purer Enjoyments,</hi> from thence to a <hi>diſlike</hi> of ſuch Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Preaching, as <hi>threaten Sin,</hi> and ſpeak out the <hi>wrath</hi> of God
againſt Iniquity, and theſe are preſently called <hi>Legal Preachers,</hi> and
the doctrine of Duty a <hi>Legal Covenant;</hi> having them once at this
point, they eaſily come to <hi>immediate Aſſiſtances,</hi> and <hi>ſpecial Gifts,</hi>
which they pretend to have above others; being thus ſet up, they
are for free Grace, and the enjoyment of God <hi>in Spirit;</hi> from
thence they come to <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> and by degrees Duties are
<hi>unneceſſary,</hi> there is <hi>no Chriſt</hi> but <hi>within them,</hi> and being <hi>freed</hi> from
the Law, whatever they do is <hi>no Tranſgreſſion.</hi> This is a Path that
Satan hath trodden of old, though now and then he may vary in
ſome Circumſtances, and be forced to ſtop before he come to the
utmoſt of his Journey. You may obſerve this Method in the <hi>late
Errors</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>See the Book ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>led</hi> Wonder Working Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence <hi>for</hi> New-England.</note> in the <hi>Familiſts</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and in thoſe
of <hi>Old-England;</hi> in all which at the long-run Men are led as far
from Scripture, as Darkneſs is from Light. Now this is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be ſeen in a <hi>progreſſive multiplication</hi> of Errors, but often may
we perceive the ſame ſubtilty of Satan in a <hi>ſimple Error,</hi> as when
he takes up <hi>part</hi> of a Truth which ſhould ſtand in <hi>conjunction</hi> with
another, and ſets it up <hi>alone</hi> againſt its own <hi>Companion,</hi> where we
ſhall have the <hi>name</hi> and pretence <hi>kept up,</hi> but the <hi>thing</hi> quite <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:49412:115"/>
God requires <hi>Services</hi> of Men, and preſcribes to their uſe,
Prayer, Hearing, Sacraments, but becauſe in theſe God is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
when Men only draw near with their Lips, he further tells
us, <hi>that he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, neither is that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
which is of the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. This part are ſome Men ſo fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that they think they are diſcharged of <hi>the other,</hi> and in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
go quite from <hi>theſe duties,</hi> and yet ſtill they profeſs they are
<hi>for Ordinances</hi> and the <hi>Worſhip of God;</hi> juſt ſo are ſome Men <hi>for
Chriſt,</hi> but then 'tis but the <hi>name,</hi> not the <hi>thing;</hi> they own Chriſt
they ſay, but then 'tis <hi>Chriſt in them,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt come in their Fleſh,</hi>
but not that Chriſt <hi>that died at Jeruſalem,</hi> as a Sacrifice for the
Sins of Men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Satan takes great care that an Errour be (in all the
ways of its propagation) <hi>cloathed with Scripture phraſes;</hi> and <hi>the
leſs</hi> the Errour can pretend to any plauſible ground of Scripture, the
more doth he endeavour to adorn it with Scripture <hi>Language,</hi> (I
underſtand this chiefly of ſuch Errors, as are deſigned for the <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude)</hi>
ſo that though Scripture be not uſed to <hi>prove</hi> the Errour,
yet are Deceivers taught to <hi>expreſs</hi> their <hi>conceptions</hi> by it, and to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate</hi>
the Words and Sentences of it to their purpoſes; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
pride and confidence, <hi>Scriptural Eloquence</hi> is a neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
to make a <hi>powerful Deluder.</hi> Obſerve the <hi>Ring-leaders</hi> of
Errors, and you ſhall find that ordinarily, ſuch have at firſt been
<hi>ſtudious</hi> of the Scriptures; and though never able to <hi>digeſt</hi> them, yet
when they <hi>turned their Ears from Truth,</hi> they have carried their
<hi>Scripture Language</hi> (which they had before brought themſelves
unto by long cuſtom) away with them, and ſtill retain it, and
expreſs their Opinions by it.</p>
                     <p>Now this is a great advantage to Satan. For Firſt, By this
means the <hi>ignorant</hi> Multitude are often caught without any more
ado; if they hear Scripture Expreſſions they are apt to think that
<hi>all is Truth</hi> which is ſpoken <hi>by them;</hi> and they the rather believe
it, becauſe they will imagine ſuch Teachers to be <hi>well verſed</hi> in
Scripture, and conſequently either ſo <hi>honeſt,</hi> or ſo <hi>knowing</hi> that
they neither <hi>can,</hi> nor <hi>will</hi> delude them. Secondly, There is a
<hi>Majeſty</hi> in Scripture which (in ſome ſence) doth <hi>ſtick</hi> to the very
<hi>expreſſions</hi> of it; Men may perceive that generally Hearers are more
<hi>affected</hi> with <hi>Scripture Eloquence,</hi> than with <hi>Play-Book Language;</hi>
it hath (as it were) a charm in the words, which makes the Ear
attentive, more than a quaint diſcourſe, ſtarched up in the dreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="208" facs="tcp:49412:116"/>
of common Rhetorick: One gives us an Obſervation to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of his own Preaching,<note place="margin">Savonarola triumph. Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis. <hi>lib. 2. c.</hi> 2.</note> and ſo may many others. While then
Men hear ſuch language, they have a reverence to it. And as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
cover their Pills with Gold that the Patient might more
willingly take them; ſo do Men often ſwallow down Errour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
due conſideration, becauſe conveyed to them in a Language
which they reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Satans ſecond care for the advancement of Errour,
(after he hath given it all the countenance he can from Scripture)
is to gild it over with <hi>ſpecious pretences,</hi> he ſets it off with all the
bravery he can, and then urgeth that as an Argument of its Truth.
Men are apt to judg that what doth <hi>better</hi> their Spiritual Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cannot be a <hi>Lye</hi> or deluſion; and the Argument were the more
conſiderable, if the advantages were <hi>ſuch</hi> as he <hi>pretends</hi> them to be:
but the very <hi>noiſe</hi> and boaſt of advantages <hi>pleaſe</hi> the unwary, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a due enquiry into their reality. The Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 18.
reduceth all this Policy of the Deceiver to two heads: (1.) <hi>Good
words,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, words that ſet out the <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> of
the thing. (2.) And <hi>fair Speeches</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Speeches that flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Condition</hi> of the party. His Art, as to the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, is to
tell them that the Notions offered to them are <hi>ſpecial Diſcoveries,
rare Myſteries,</hi> which have been hidden from others; and thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
that it muſt of neceſſity conduce much to their <hi>happineſs,</hi> and
Spiritual <hi>Perfection</hi> to know and embrace them. Thoſe that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the Church in <hi>Pauls</hi> days with falſe Doctrines, uſed this
ſlight of boaſting, as appears by that expreſſion in 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 20.
Oppoſitions of Science;</hi> it ſeems they called their opinions (though
they were but <hi>prophane,</hi> and <hi>vain-bablings)</hi> by the name of <hi>Science</hi>
or <hi>Knowledg,</hi> implying that all others, even the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were <hi>in the Dark,</hi> and came ſhort of their <hi>Illumination.</hi> The
like we have in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 24. of that abominable Propheteſs <hi>Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
who recommended her blaſphemous filthy Doctrines, under
the name of <hi>Depths,</hi> Profundities, or hidden Knowledg, though
the Spirit of God told that Church they were not ſuch; but <hi>if
Depths,</hi> they were <hi>depths of Satan,</hi> (as 'tis added there by way of
Correction) and not of the Spirit of God. We may trace theſe

                           </gap>ſteps</hi> of Satan in all <hi>conſiderably</hi> prevailing Errors: for what
hath been more common than to hear Men ſpeak of the deſigns
they have been carrying on, under the ſpecious Titles <hi>Of Chriſt's
coming to ſet up a Righteous Kingdom; The Churches coming out of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49412:116"/>
and out of the Wilderneſs; the dawning of the day of the Lord; the
day of Reformation, the time of the Reſtitution of all things;</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Brags of the ſame kind. I ſhall add no particular
Inſtance of this nature; but a few ſtrains of <hi>H. Nicholas,</hi> with
whom ſuch high promiſing vaunts were ordinary. His Service of
Love, he compares to the <hi>moſt Holy,</hi> (whereas <hi>Johns</hi> Doctrine of
Repentance was but a preparation to the <hi>Holy;</hi> and the <hi>Service of
Chriſt</hi> he allowed to be no more than as the <hi>Holy</hi> of the Temple)
this his Service he calls, <hi>the perfection of Life, the completion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
the perfect concluſion of the Works of God, the Throne of Chriſt,
the true Reſt of the Choſen of God, the laſt Day, the ſure Word of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
the New Jeruſalem,</hi> and what not?</p>
                     <p>If we make further enquiry into the <hi>nature</hi> of theſe fair promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Myſteries, we ſhall find that Satan moſt frequently pitcheth
upon theſe <hi>three.</hi> Firſt, He befools Men into a belief, that the
Scriptures do under the <hi>Vail</hi> of their Words and Sentences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſome <hi>hidden Notions,</hi> that are <hi>of purpoſe</hi> ſo diſguiſed, that they
may be <hi>locked up</hi> from the generality of Men, at leaſt from <hi>learned</hi>
and wiſe Men; and that theſe Rarities cannot be diſcerned from
the <hi>uſual ſignifications</hi> of the Words and Phraſes, (as we underſtand
other Books of the ſame Language) but they fancy theſe Sacred
Writings to be like the Writings of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">As <hi>Ibis a ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabeo accipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris pulchritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pat:</hi> by which they ſignified the Moon bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing its Light from the Sun.</note> by which they
abſconded their Myſteries, eſpecially like that kind of Writing,
whereby under words of <hi>common known ſence,</hi> they intended things
which the <hi>Words themſelves could not ſignify;</hi> and that which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
this imagination is this, that we read frequently of <hi>Myſteries</hi>
in Scriptures, and <hi>hidden Wiſdom,</hi> and the <hi>ſpecial Revelation</hi> of
them to God's Children which are very great Truths, but yet
not to be ſo underſtood, as this Deluſion ſuppoſeth: for theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
in Scripture intend no more than this, that the <hi>deſign</hi> of
God to <hi>ſave Man by Chriſt</hi> is in it ſelf a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> which never would
have been <hi>found out</hi> without a <hi>ſpecial Revelation;</hi> and that though
this Myſtery is <hi>now revealed</hi> by the Goſpel, yet as to the <hi>application</hi>
of it to the Hearts of Men in <hi>Converſion,</hi> by the Operation of the
Spirit, it is <hi>yet a Myſtery.</hi> But none of theſe intend any ſuch ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
that there are private Notions of <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Doctrine</hi> that are
lying <hi>under ground</hi> (as it were) in Scripture words, which the
words in the <hi>common Language</hi> will <hi>not acquaint</hi> us withal; nay, the
contrary is expreſly affirmed, when we are told that all is <hi>plainly</hi>
laid open to the very <hi>ſimple,</hi> ſo that from the Scriptures they may
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49412:117"/>
as well underſtand the <hi>fundamental</hi> principles of Religion, as they
may underſtand <hi>any other</hi> thing which their language doth expreſs
to them.</p>
                     <p>However in this Satan takes advantage of Mens <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity,</hi>
to make them forward in the <hi>acceptation</hi> of ſuch offers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when ſuch things are repreſented, as the <hi>only ſaving diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
which a Man cannot be ignorant of but with hazard of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In this boaſt of Myſtery, Satan ſometimes takes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
courſe ſomewhat differing from the former, and that is to put
Men upon <hi>Allegorical reflections</hi> and alluſions, by which the <hi>Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Paſſages of Scripture are made (beſides the import of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory)
<hi>reſemblances</hi> of ſpiritual Truths; which ſuppoſeth the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of Scripture to be <hi>true,</hi> (but ſtill as no better than the <hi>firſt Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
to train up Beginners withal,) yet withal, that the <hi>ſpiritual
meaning</hi> of it raiſeth the skilful to a higher Form in Chriſt's School.
At this rate all are turned into Allegories. If they fall upon the <hi>firſt
of Geneſis,</hi> they think they then truly underſtand it, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and God's <hi>ſeparating</hi> of them, with ſuch
other Paſſages, to the <hi>regeneration</hi> of the Soul. The like work
make they with the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of Chriſt. But then the crafty Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
at laſt enticeth them on to <hi>let go the Hiſtory,</hi> as if it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a <hi>Parable,</hi> not really acted, but only fitted to <hi>repreſent</hi>
Notions to us. <hi>Allegories</hi> were a <hi>Trap</hi> which the Devil had for the
<hi>Jews,</hi> and wherein they wonderfully pleaſed themſelves. How
much <hi>Origen</hi> abuſed himſelf and the Scriptures by this humour is
known to many; and how the Devil hath prevailed generally by
it upon giddy people in later times, I need not tell you.</p>
                     <p>The pretence that Satan hath for this dealing is raiſed from
ſome paſſages of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> wherein many things of the

the <hi>Grammatical</hi> Sence, (which all of us do own) and beſides the
<hi>Tropological</hi> ſence (which is not divers or diſtinct from the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical;
as when from Hiſtories, we deduce inſtructions of holy

                     <p>Thirdly, The Devil hath yet another way of <hi>coining</hi> Myſteries,
and that is a pretence of a <hi>more full</hi> diſcovery of Notions and Ways,
which (as he tells thoſe that are willing to believe him,) are but
<hi>glanced</hi> at in the Scripture; and this doth not only contain his boaſt
of <hi>unfolding Prophecies,</hi> and the dangerous applications of them to
Times and Places that are no way concerned, (which hath more
than once put Men upon dangerous undertakings) but alſo his
<hi>large promiſe of teaching the Way of the Lord more perfectly,</hi> and of
leading Men into a <hi>full comprehenſion</hi> of thoſe <hi>tremendous Myſteries,</hi>
wherein the Scripture hath <hi>as induſtriouſly</hi> concealed the <hi>Reaſons,
Way,</hi> and <hi>Manner of their Being,</hi> as it hath <hi>fully aſſerted</hi> that they
are, (ſuch are the <hi>Decrees</hi> of God, the <hi>Trinity,</hi> &amp;c.) as alſo of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding
and teaching <hi>at large</hi> thoſe things that the Scripture ſeems
only to <hi>hint at.</hi> In all which points we have inſtances enough at
hand, which will ſhew us how the Devil hath played his Game, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by making Men <hi>bold</hi> in things <hi>not revealed,</hi> or by drawing Men
to <hi>diſlike ſolid</hi> Truths, and by puffing them up with notions, till

inamoured with theſe ſuppoſed Myſteries. With theſe he ſtrokes
their heads, and cauſeth them to hug themſelves in a Dream of
an imaginary happineſs. For if they have the knowledg of Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49412:118"/>
which are locked up from other Men, they cannot avoid
this Concluſion, <hi>That they are the only Favourites of Heaven; that they
only have the Spirit, are only taught of God,</hi> &amp;c. Such ſwelling
words of vanity have ever accompanied Deluſion. And indeed,
we ſhall find the confidence of ſuch Men <hi>more ſtrong,</hi> and their
falſe embracements <hi>more rapturous,</hi> than <hi>ordinarily</hi> the ways of
Truth do afford, upon this account; that in ſuch caſes, Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is <hi>elevated,</hi> and the delights of a <hi>raiſed Fancy</hi> are <hi>exceſſive,</hi> and
<hi>Enthuſiaſtical.</hi> 'Tis a kind of Spiritual <hi>Frenzy,</hi> which extends
all the Faculties to an extraordinary Activity; the Devil doing
all he can to further it, by his utmoſt Contributions. Joy, delight,
hope, love, are all raiſed to make an <hi>hubbub</hi> in the heart; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
on the contrary, <hi>Truth is modeſt, humble, ſober,</hi> and affords a <hi>more
ſilent joy,</hi> though more <hi>even</hi> and <hi>laſting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here might I ſet Errour before you in its <hi>rant,</hi> and give you
a taſte of the <hi>high flown ſtraines</hi> of it. <hi>Montanus</hi> (as vile as he
was) had the confidence to call himſelf the <hi>Comforter. Novatus</hi>
and his Brother would be no leſs than <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> The
<hi>Gnoſticks</hi> called themſelves the <hi>Illuminati.</hi> The <hi>Swinkfieildians</hi>
aſſumed the title of the <hi>Confeſſors of the Glory of Chriſt.</hi> The
<hi>Family of Love</hi> had their <hi>Evangelium Regni,</hi> the Goſpel of the
Kingdom. The <hi>Fratricelli,</hi> diſtinguiſhed themſelves from others
by the term <hi>Spiritual. Muntzer</hi> aſſerted, That all of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>were Gods Elect:</hi> and that all the Children of their <hi>Religion</hi>
were to be called <hi>the Children of God;</hi> and that all others were
<hi>ungodly,</hi> and deſigned to <hi>Damnation. H. Nicholas</hi> affirms, That
there was <hi>no knowledg of Chriſt nor Scripture, but in his Family.</hi>
To this purpoſe moſt of them ſpeak, that forſake the wayes of
Truth; and though theſe ſwellings are but <hi>wind</hi> and <hi>vapour,</hi> yet
thoſe <hi>heights</hi> are very <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to the Devils purpoſes: who by
this means <hi>confirms</hi> thoſe whom he hath already <hi>Conquered,</hi> and
then fits them out with the greater confidence to allure others;
and Men are apt enough to be drawn by fair ſhews, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
boaſtings. But I proceed.</p>
                     <p>The third Stratagem of Satan for promoting Errour, is <hi>to
aſtoniſh Men with ſtrange Language, and affected expreſſions.</hi> It was
an old device of Satan to coyn an <hi>unintelligible gibberiſh</hi> as the
proper <hi>vehicle</hi> of ſtrange <hi>Enthuſiaſticks</hi> Doctrine, and this he artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſuits to his pretended Myſteries; without this his rare
Diſcoveries would be too flat and dull to gain upon any Man
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49412:119"/>
of competent underſtanding. For if theſe <hi>Dotages</hi> were cloathed
in <hi>plain words,</hi> they would either appear to be <hi>direct non-ſence,</hi>
or <hi>ridiculous folly.</hi> It concerns him when he hath any feats of
Deluſion in hand, to ſet them off with a <hi>canting ſpeech,</hi> as jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
uſe their hard words, of <hi>Ailif, Caſyl, Zaze, Preſto, Millat,</hi> &amp;c.
to put their ignorant Admirers into a belief of ſome unknown
power by which they do their Wonders. And this is in ſome
ſort neceſſary; extraordinary matters are above expreſſion, and
ſuch <hi>wild expreſſions</hi> put Men into an expectation of things <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime.</hi>
This <hi>knack</hi> Satan hath conſtantly uſed. <hi>Montanus</hi> had his
ſtrange Speeches. And all along downward to our times, we may
obſerve, That Errour hath had this gaudy dreſs; the <hi>Familiſts</hi>
eſpecially abound with it, you may read whole Books full of
ſuch a kind of ſpeaking, as the Book called <hi>Theologia Germani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
or <hi>German Divinity;</hi> the Books of <hi>Jacob Behmen, The bright
Morning Star,</hi> &amp;c. Neither are the <hi>Papiſts</hi> free; one of late hath
taken the paines to ſhew them this, and other follies: among
them you may find ſuch talk as this, of being <hi>becloſed in the
mid-head of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dr. Stilling-fleet</hi> Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>and in his meek-head; of being ſubſtantially uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God, of being oned to God; as alſo of the abſtractedneſs of
Life, of paſſive <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions, of the Deiform fund of the Soul; of a ſtate
of introverſion: of a Super-eſſential life, a ſtate of nothingneſs,</hi> &amp;c.
Juſt like the raveings of <hi>H. Nicholas, David George,</hi> and others,
who confidently diſcourſe of being <hi>godded with God,</hi> of being
<hi>conſubſtantiated with the Deity,</hi> and of <hi>Gods being manned with
them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have oft conſidered, what reaſon might be given for the <hi>take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs</hi>
of ſuch expreſſions, and have been forced to ſatisfie my
ſelf with theſe: Firſt, Many miſtake the knowledge of <hi>words,</hi>
for the knowledge of <hi>things.</hi> And well may poor ignorant Men
believe, they have attained, no man knows what, by this device;
when among Learned Men, the Knowledg of <hi>words</hi> is eſteemed
ſo great a pitch of Learning, and they nouriſh a great many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
that are only <hi>verbal.</hi> Secondly, Some are pleaſed to
be accounted <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanders</hi> by others, and reſt in ſuch high words,
as a <hi>badge</hi> of Knowledge. Thirdly, Some are delighted with
ſuch an hard Language upon an hope, That it will lead them
to the knowledg of the <hi>things</hi> at laſt: they think <hi>ſtrange</hi> expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are a ſign of <hi>deep</hi> Myſteries. I knew one, that ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the reading of <hi>Jacob Behmens</hi> Books, (though at preſent
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49412:119"/>
he confeſſed, he was ſcarce able to make common ſenſe of three
lines together,) upon a ſecret enticement that he had from the
Language,<note place="margin">Dicas cos mera tonitrua ſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, nam com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni ſermone ſpreto, exoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum neſcio quod idioma ſibi fingunt, viſi ſunt ſuos diſcipulos ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra coelum ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere. <hi>Calvin.</hi> in <hi>Jud.</hi> 13.</note> to come to ſome <hi>excellent</hi> diſcovery, by much pains
and reading. Fourthly, Some that have their Fancies <hi>heated,</hi>
have by this means broken <hi>confuſed impreſſions</hi> of ſtrange things
in their imaginations, and conceive themſelves to know things
beyond what common Language can expreſs: as if with <hi>Paul,</hi>
rapt up into the third Heaven, <hi>they hear, and ſee Wonders un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable.</hi>
But what reaſon ſoever prevails with Men to take up
ſuch a way of ſpeaking, Satan makes them believe, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
a rich <hi>Mine</hi> or <hi>Treaſury,</hi> not of common Truths, but of
extraordinary <hi>Profundities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In ſtead of Argument to confirm an Errour, ſometimes
we have only <hi>bold Aſſertions, that it is Truth,</hi> and a confident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the contrary as an Errour; urging the danger of Mens
rejecting it, <hi>backed with threatning of Hell and Damnation:</hi> and
all this in the words of Scripture. To be ſure they are right,
and all other Men are wrong. This kind of confidence and
fierceneſs hath been ſtill the complexion of any remarkable way
of Deluſion; for that commonly <hi>confines</hi> their Charity to their
own <hi>Party,</hi> (which is a great token of an Errour) not only
may you obſerve in ſuch extraordinary <hi>Proclamations of Wrath</hi>
againſt thoſe that will not believe them: (a practice uſed by the
Mad <hi>Fanaticks</hi> of <hi>Munſter;</hi> who, (as our <hi>Quakers</hi> were wont to
do) go up and down the ſtreets, crying, <hi>Wo, wo; Repent, repent;
come out of</hi> Babylon; <hi>the heavy Wrath of God; the Axe is laid to
the root of the Tree.)</hi> But in their more ſetled Teaching, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and of the <hi>carnal Church,</hi> that do op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them. Take for this <hi>H. Nicholas</hi> his words, <hi>all Knowledg</hi>
(beſides his) <hi>is but witchery and blindneſs, and all other Teachers,
and Learners, are a falſe Chriſtianity, and the Devils Synagogue;
a neſt of Devils, and wicked Spirits; a falſe Being, the Antichriſt,
the Kingdom of Hell, the Majeſty of the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. This piece of
Art, not only our <hi>Quakers,</hi> (to whom nothing is more familiar,
than to ſay to any oppoſer, <hi>Thou art Damn'd, thou art in the
Gall of bitterneſs, the Lake of fire and brimſtone is prepared for
thee,</hi> &amp;c.) but alſo the <hi>Papiſts</hi> commonly practiſe, who <hi>ſhut all
out of Heaven</hi> that are not of <hi>their Church;</hi> and when they would
affright any from Proteſtaniſm, they make not nice to tell him,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49412:120"/>
That there is no <hi>poſſibility of Salvation,</hi> but in their way.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſons of this Policy are theſe, (1) The Heart is apt
to be <hi>ſtartled</hi> with threatnings, and <hi>moved</hi> by commands; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
thoſe that are of a more <hi>tender</hi> and frightful Spirit: and
though they know nothing by themſelves, yet theſe beget fears,
which may <hi>ſecretly</hi> betray Reaſon, and make Men leave the right
way becauſe of affrightment. (2) The <hi>confidence</hi> of the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of ſuch things, hath alſo its <hi>prevalency:</hi> for Men are apt to
think that they would not ſpeak ſo, if they were not <hi>very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
and had not <hi>real experience</hi> of what they ſaid: and thus are
Men <hi>threaped</hi> out of their own Perſwaſions. (3) The <hi>native
Majeſty</hi> of Scripture, in a buſineſs of ſo great <hi>hazard,</hi> adds an
unexpreſſible force to ſuch threatnings: and though (being <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyed)</hi>
they are no more <hi>Scripture Threatnings;</hi> yet, becauſe God
hath ſpoken his diſpleaſure in <hi>thoſe words,</hi> Men are apt to <hi>revere</hi>
them: as Men cannot avoid to fear a Serpent or Toad, (though
they know the Sting and Poyſon were taken out) becauſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
did furniſh them with a Sting or Venom.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, 'Tis an uſual trick of Satan to derive a credit and
honour to Errour, from the excellencies (ſuppoſed, or real) of
the <hi>Perſons</hi> that more eminently appear for it. So that it fetcheth
no ſmall ſtrength from the qualities of thoſe that propagate it.
The Vulgar (that do not uſually dive deep into the Natures of
Things) content themſelves with the moſt <hi>Superficial</hi> Arguments,
and are ſooner won to a good conceit of any Opinion, by the
reſpects they carry to the Author, than by the <hi>ſtrongeſt Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The excellencies that uſually move them, are either their
<hi>gifts</hi> or their <hi>holineſs.</hi> If the Seedſmen of an Errour be <hi>Learned,</hi>
or <hi>Eloquent</hi> and <hi>Affectionate</hi> in his ſpeaking, Men are apt to <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe</hi>
to any thing he ſhall ſay, from a blind <hi>devotional admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of the Parts wherewith he is endowed. And often, where
there is no Learning, or where Learning is decryed, (as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
too much of Man) if there be <hi>Natural fluency</hi> of ſpeech,
with a ſufficient meaſure of <hi>confidence,</hi> it raiſeth them ſo much
the <hi>higher</hi> in the eſteem of the common ſort, who therefore judge
him to be immediately taught of God, and <hi>divinely</hi> furniſhed
with gifts. At this point began the Diviſions of the Church
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> they had ſeveral Officers ſeverally gifted; ſome were
taken with one Mans gift, others with another Mans; ſome are
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49412:120"/>
for <hi>Paul,</hi> as being <hi>profound,</hi> and nervous in his Diſcourſes; others
for <hi>Apollo,</hi> as <hi>Eloquent,</hi> a third ſort were for <hi>Cephas,</hi> as (ſuppoſe)
an <hi>Affectionate</hi> Preacher: thus upon <hi>perſonal reſpects</hi> were they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into Parties. And if theſe ſeveral Teachers were of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Opinions, their adherents imbraced them upon an <hi>affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
conceit</hi> of their Excellencies. And generally Satan hath
wrought much by ſuch conſiderations as theſe. This he urgeth
againſt Chriſt himſelf, when he ſet up the wiſdom and learning
of the Rulers and Phariſees, as an argument of Truth in their
way of rejecting ſuch a <hi>Meſſias; Joh. 7. 48. Have any of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
or of the Phariſees believed on him?</hi> There is no inſinuation
more frequent than this; theſe are <hi>learned, excellent, able Men,</hi>
and therefore what they ſay, or teach, is not to be disbelieved;
and though this be but <hi>Argumentum ſtultum,</hi> a fooliſh Argument,
yet ſome that would be accounted wiſe, do make very great uſe
of it. The crack of <hi>Learned Doctors</hi> among the Papiſts, is one
<hi>Topick</hi> of perſwaſion to Popery, and ſo to other Errours, as appears
by this, That all Errours abound with large declamations of the
<hi>praiſes</hi> of their <hi>Founders</hi> and Teachers: and the moſt illiterate
Errours uſually magnifie the excellent <hi>inſpirements,</hi> and gifts of
utterance of their Leaders.</p>
                     <p>But the other excellency of <hi>Holineſs</hi> in the Teachers of Errour,
is more generally and more advantagiouſly improved by Satan,
to perſwade Men, that all is true Doctrine which ſuch Men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.
Of this Deluſion Chriſt forewarned us, <hi>They ſhall come in
Sheeps cloathing;</hi> that is, under the mask of ſeeming holineſs;
(at leaſt at firſt;) notwithſtanding, <hi>beware of them,</hi> Math. 7. 15.
Thoſe complained of by <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 15. though they were
<hi>Satans Miniſters,</hi> yet that they and their Doctrine might be more
plauſibly entertained, they were <hi>transformed as the Miniſters of
Righteouſneſs:</hi> this cunning we may eſpie in Hereticks of all
ages. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> uſed a pretence of <hi>Sanctity</hi> as
a main piece of Art, to draw others to their way; their Alms,
Faſtings, long Prayers, ſtrict Obſervations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were all deſigned
as a <hi>Net</hi> to catch the Multitude withal. The lying Doctrines of
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> were foretold by <hi>Paul,</hi> to have their ſucceſs from this
ſtratagem; all that Idolatry and Heatheniſm which he is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 2.</note> muſt be, (and hath been) through the <hi>hypocriſie</hi> of a <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
holineſs;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 13. 11.</note> and where he intends moſt to play the <hi>Dragon,</hi> he
there moſt artificially counterfeits the <hi>innocency</hi> and ſimplicity of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49412:121"/>
the <hi>Lamb. Arch-hereticks</hi> have been <hi>Arch-pretenders</hi> to Sanctity.
And ſuch pretences have great influence upon Men: for Holineſs
and Truth are ſo near of kin, that they will not readily believe
that it can be a <hi>falſe Doctrine</hi> which an <hi>holy Man</hi> Teacheth; they
think that God that hath given a Teacher <hi>Holineſs,</hi> will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him <hi>Truth:</hi> Nay, this is an eaſie and plauſible <hi>meaſure,</hi> which
they have for Truth and Errour. To enquire into the intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and depths of a Diſputation, is too burdenſome and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
for ordinary Men, and therefore they ſatisfie themſelves with
this conſideration, (which hath little toyl in it, and as little
certainly) <hi>That ſurely God will not leave holy Men to a deluſion.</hi>
It would be endleſs to give all the inſtances that are at hand in
this Matter; I ſhall only add a few things of Satans method
in managing this Argument, as</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When he hath a Deſign of <hi>common,</hi> or prevailing Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
he mainly endeavours to <hi>corrupt</hi> ſome perſon of a more
<hi>ſtrict</hi> ſerious, and religious carriage, to be the <hi>Captain</hi> and Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader;
ſuch Men were <hi>Pelagius, Arrius, Socinus,</hi> &amp;c. He mainly
endeavours to have fit inſtruments. If he be upon that deſign
of <hi>blemiſhing</hi> Religion, and to bring Truth into a diſ-eſteem;
then (as one obſerves) he perſwades ſuch into the Miniſtry,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acontius</hi> Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem Satanae. <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. pag. 406 <hi>Oxon.</hi>
                        </note> as he
fore-ſees are likely to be <hi>idle, careleſs, prophane,</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous;</hi>
or doth endeavour to <hi>promote</hi> ſuch Miniſters into more <hi>conſpicuous
places,</hi> and provokes them to miſcarriage, that ſo their Example
may be an Objection againſt Truth, while in the mean time,
he is willing, that the Oppoſers of Truth ſhould continue their
ſmooth carriage; and then he puts a <hi>Two-edged</hi> Sword into the
hands of the unſtable: can that be Truth where there is ſo much
Wickedneſs? and can this be Errour, where there is ſo much
Holineſs?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in Proſecution of this Deſign, he uſually puts Men
upon ſome more than <hi>ordinary ſtrictneſs,</hi> that the pretence of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
may be the more augmented; in this caſe a courſe of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Sanctity is not enough, they muſt be above the common
Practice; ſome ſingular <hi>Additions</hi> of ſeverity and exactneſs above
what is written, are commonly affected to make them the more
remarkable. Chriſt notes this in the Phariſees, concerning all
their Devotions, and the wayes of expreſſing them; their <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries</hi>
ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Jerom. Theoph. Lyra. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 5. (as ſome think) were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by that Text of <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 8. but only that they ſhould
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49412:121"/>
remember the Law, and endeavour not to forget it; as they do
that tye a thred, or ſuch like thing about their Finger for a
Remembrancer; according to <hi>Prov. 3. 3. Bind them about thy neck,
write them upon the Table of thine heart.</hi> However, if they were
literally enjoyned, they would have them (as Chriſt tells them)
<hi>broader</hi> than others, as an evidence of their greater care. The
<hi>Cathari</hi> boaſted of Sanctity and good Works, and rejected ſecond
Marriages; the <hi>Apoſtolici</hi> were ſo called, from a pretended ſtricter
imitation of the ſingular holineſs of the Apoſtles. The <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſians</hi>
made themſelves <hi>Eunuches</hi> (according to the Letter) <hi>for
the Kingdom of God.</hi> The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> accounted that no true
Church, where any ſpot or infirmity was found. The <hi>Meſſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
or <hi>Euchytae</hi> were for conſtant praying. The <hi>Nudipedales</hi> for
going bare-foot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> urge Canonical Hours, Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,
Pennances, Pilgrimages, voluntary Poverty, abſtinence from
Meats, and Marriage in their Prieſts and Votaries. In a word,
all noted Sects have ſomething of ſpecial <hi>ſingularity,</hi> whereby
they would difference themſelves from others, as a peculiar <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi>
of their greater ſtrictneſs; and for want of better ſtuff,
they ſometimes take up affected geſtures, devotional looks, and
outward garbs; all which have this note, That what they moſt
ſtand upon, God hath leaſt, or not at all <hi>required at their hands;</hi>
their <hi>voluntary Humility,</hi> or <hi>neglecting of the Body,</hi> being but <hi>will-worſhip,</hi>
and a ſelf-deviſed piece of Religion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When once Men are ſet in the way of exerciſing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities,
Satan endeavours (by working upon their fancies) to
preſs them on further to a <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> in theſe<note n="*" place="margin">At<expan>

of ſtrictneſs, ſo that the practiſer themſelves are not only <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi>
in theſe uſages, and the opinions that are concomitant
with them; but others are the more eaſily drawn to like and
<hi>profeſs</hi> the ſame things. Any <hi>ſerious</hi> temper under any Profeſſion
of Religion, eaſily comes to be <hi>devout,</hi> and readily complies with
opportunities of evincing its Devotion by ſtrictneſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhall find among <hi>Heathens,</hi> a great devotional ſeverity,
and ſuch as far exceeds all of that kind, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do
uſually brag of, the <hi>Magi</hi> abſtained from Wine, eat not the fleſh
of living Creatures, and profeſſed Virginity. The <hi>Indian Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
did the like, and beſides uſed themſelves to incredible hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
they laid upon skins, ſuſtained the violence of the Sun, and
Storms, and exerciſed themſelves therewith; ſome ſpending
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49412:122"/>
Thirty ſeven years in this courſe, others more. We read ſtrange
things of this nature concerning the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſts, and others.
The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> are not without their Religious Orders, which
pretend a more holy and auſtere Life than others; and though
of ſome (as of the <hi>Torlachs</hi> and <hi>Dervizes)</hi> ſeveral private Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
are reported, yet of others, (as of the Order of <hi>Calender)</hi>
we are aſſured from Hiſtory, That they profeſs Virginity, and
expoſe themſelves to Hardſhip, and a ſtricter Devotion in their
way; and generally 'tis ſaid, of all of them, That they go mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
clad, or half naked; ſome abſtinent in Eating, and Drinking,
profeſſing Poverty, renouncing the World: ſome can endure
cutting and ſlaſhing, as if they were inſenſible; ſome profeſs
perpetual Silence, though urged with Injuries, and Tortures;
others have Chains about their Necks and Arms, to ſhew, that
they are bound up from the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If ſuch things may
be found among <hi>Heathens,</hi> no wonder that Errour boaſts of
them, for in both there is the ſame reaſon of Mens <hi>pleaſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>
in ſuch hardſhips (which is from a Natural Devotion, aſſiſted
by Satans cunning,) and the ſame Deſign driven on by it; for
the Devil doth confirm <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans</hi> in their falſe
Worſhip, by the <hi>reverence</hi> and reſpect they carry to <hi>ſuch</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Becauſe Religious Holineſs hath a beauty in it, and is
very lovely; he doth all he can to affect Men with the higheſt
<hi>revernce</hi> for theſe <hi>pretences</hi> of Religious ſtrictneſs: ſo that they
that will not be at <hi>pains</hi> to practiſe them, can beſtow an exceſſive
reſpect and <hi>admiration</hi> upon thoſe that are grown <hi>famous</hi> in the
uſe of ſuch things; and by that means, being almoſt adored, they
are without doubt perſwaded, that all they teach or do is right,
and in a doting fondneſs they multiply Superſtitious Errours.
<hi>Idolatry</hi> is ſuppoſed to have a great part of its riſe from this:
While Men endeavoured to expreſs their thankful and admiring
<hi>remembrances</hi> of ſome excellent Perſons, by ſetting up their
<hi>Pictures,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Purchas</hi> Pilg. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. cap. 10. out of <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
                        </note> their Poſterity began to worſhip them as <hi>Gods:</hi> Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramages
were firſt ſet on foot by the reſpects that Men
gave to <hi>places</hi> that were made <hi>famous</hi> by Perſons and Actions
of more than ordinary Holineſs: and becauſe the Devil found
Men ſo very apt to pleaſe themſelves in paying ſuch Devotional
<hi>Reverences,</hi> he wrought upon their Superſtitious humour to <hi>multiply</hi>
to themſelves the <hi>occaſions</hi> thereof, and by fabulous Traditions
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49412:122"/>
ſent them to places no otherwiſe made <hi>memorable</hi> than by Dreams
and <hi>Impoſtures.</hi> Much of this you might ſee if you would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
a <hi>Caravan</hi> from <hi>Cairo</hi> to <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Purchas</hi> Pilg. 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 5.</note> where you would
ſee the zealous Pilgrims with a great many Oriſons and Prayers
<hi>compaſſing Abrahams</hi> houſe; <hi>kiſſing</hi> a Stone, which (they are told) fell
from Heaven, bleſſing themſelves with a <hi>relique</hi> of the old Veſture
of Abrahams Houſe; <hi>waſhing</hi> themſelves in the Pond, which (as
their Tradition goes) the <hi>Angel</hi> ſhewed to <hi>Hagar; ſaluting</hi> the
Mountain of Pardons; throwing <hi>Stones</hi> in defiances of the Devil, as
(their Legend tells them) <hi>Iſmael</hi> did; their Prayers on the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Health;</hi> their viſit to the <hi>Prophets Tomb</hi> at <hi>Medina,</hi> &amp;c. The
like might you obſerve among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in their Pilgrimages to
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> to the <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Loretto's</hi> Chappel and
other places. By ſuch devices as theſe the unobſervant people are
tranſported with a <hi>pleaſure,</hi> inſomuch that they not only perſwade
themſelves they are <hi>very devout</hi> in theſe Reverences, but they alſo
become <hi>unalterably fixed</hi> to theſe Errours that do ſupport theſe
<hi>delightful</hi> Practices, or as conſequences do iſſue from them.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, A more plauſible Argument for Errour (than the
Learning and Holineſs of the Perſons that profeſs it) is that of
<hi>Inſpiration,</hi> in which the Devil ſoars a loft, and pretends the higheſt
<hi>divine</hi> warrant for his falſhoods: for <hi>God is Truth,</hi> and <hi>we know that
no lye is of the Truth.</hi> Now to make Men believe that God by his
Holy Spirit doth in any manner <hi>dictate</hi> ſuch Opinions, or certainly
<hi>reveal</hi> ſuch things for Truths: is one of the <hi>higheſt</hi> Artifices that
he can pretend to, and ſuch a confirmation muſt it be (to thoſe
that are ſo perſwaded,) that all diſputes and doubtings muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
be ſilenced.</p>
                     <p>That the Devil can thus <hi>transform himſelf into an Angel of Light,</hi>
we are aſſured from Scripture, which hath particularly cautioned
us againſt this cheat. The Apoſtacy of the later times, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1.
the Apoſtle foretells ſhould be carried on by the prevalency of this
pretence, <hi>Some ſhall depart from the Faith, giving heed to ſeducing
Spirits.</hi> That by <hi>Spirits</hi> there, <hi>Doctrines</hi> are intended rather than
<hi>Doctors,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoſtacy of the latter times <hi>pag.</hi> 7.</note> is <hi>Mr. Medes</hi> interpretation: but it will come all to one if
we conſider that the word <hi>Spirit</hi> carryes more in it, than either
<hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Doctor;</hi> for to call either the one or the other <hi>a Spirit</hi>
would be intollerably harſh, if it were not for this, that that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
is hereby ſuppoſed to pretend an <hi>infallability</hi> from the <hi>Spirit of
God,</hi> or (which is all one) that he received his <hi>Doctrine</hi> by ſome
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49412:123"/>
                        <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> of the Spirit; ſo that by <hi>ſeducing Spirits</hi> muſt
be, <hi>Men or Doctrines that ſeduce others to believe them, by the pretence
of the Spirit, or Inſpiration:</hi> and that text of 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1. doth thus
explain it, <hi>believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they
are of God;</hi> which is as much as if he had ſaid, believe not every
<hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Doctrine</hi> that ſhall pretend he is <hi>ſent of God,</hi> and hath <hi>his
Spirit;</hi> and the reaſon there given makes it yet more plain, becauſe
many <hi>falſe Prophets are gone out into the World:</hi> So that theſe <hi>Spirits</hi>
are <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> Men that pretend inſpiration. And the warning,
<hi>believe not every Spirit,</hi> tell us, that Satan doth with ſuch a dexterity
<hi>counterfeit</hi> the Spirits Inſpirations, that holy and good Men are in
no ſmall <hi>hazard</hi> to be deceived thereby. Moſt full to this purpoſe
is that of 2 Theſſ. 2. 2. <hi>That ye be not ſoon ſhaken in Mind, or be
troubled, neither by Spirit, nor by Word, nor by Letter as from us, as
that the day of Chriſt is at hand;</hi> where the ſeveral <hi>means</hi> of ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
are particularly reckoned,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Prideaux</hi> Orat. X. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir. Seducto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus.</note> as diſtinct from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and
<hi>Doctors,</hi> and by Spirit can be meant no other than a pretence of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
or Revelation.</p>
                     <p>'Tis evident then that Satan by this Artifice, uſeth to put a
ſtamp of divine Warrant upon his adulterate Coyn; and if we
look into his practice, we ſhall in all ages find him at this work.
Among <hi>Heathens</hi> he frequently gained a repute to his ſuperſtitious
Idolatrous worſhip by this device: The Men of greateſt note a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them feigned a <hi>ſpiritual commerce</hi> with the Gods. <hi>Empedocles</hi>
endeavoured to make the people believe that there was a kind of
<hi>Divinity</hi> in him, and affecting to be eſteemed more than a Man,
caſt himſelf into the burnings of <hi>Mongebel,</hi> that they might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him to have been <hi>taken up to the Gods. Pythagoras</hi> his Fiction
of a Journey to Hell was upon the ſame account. <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> and
<hi>Cedrenus</hi> report no leſs of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> than that he had <hi>familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes</hi>
with their ſuppoſed Dieties: and the like did they believe
of their <hi>Magi</hi> and Prieſts; inſomuch that ſome cunning <hi>Politicians</hi>
(obſerving how the vulgar were under a deep reverence to ſuch
pretences) gave it out that they had received their <hi>Laws</hi> by <hi>divine
Inſpirations. Numa Pompilius</hi> feigned he received his Inſtitutions
from the <hi>Nymph Aegeria: Lycurgus</hi> from <hi>Apollo: Minos</hi> the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
of <hi>Candy,</hi> baoſted that <hi>Jupiter</hi> was his Familiar. <hi>Mahomet</hi>
alſo ſpeaks as high this way as any, his <hi>Alcoran</hi> muſt be no leſs
than a <hi>Law</hi> received <hi>from God,</hi> and to that end, he pretends a
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49412:123"/>
ſtrange Journey to Heaven, and frequent converſe with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
<hi>Gabriel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we trace Satan in the Errours which he hath raiſed up under
the profeſſion of the Scriptures, we may obſerve the ſame method,
the <hi>Valentinians, Gnoſticks, Montaniſts</hi> talked as confidently of the
Spirit, as <hi>Moſes</hi> or the Prophets could do, and a great deal more;
for ſome of them blaſphemouſly called themſelves the <hi>Paraclete,</hi> or
Comforter. Among the Monſters which later Ages produced, we
ſtill find the ſame ſtrain; one ſaith he is <hi>Enoch,</hi> another ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the <hi>great Prophet,</hi> another hath raptures, and all immediately
inſpired. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> have as much of this cheat among them as
any other, and ſome of their learned Defenders avouch their <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Propheticum,</hi> and <hi>Miraculorum Gloria, Propheſies</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi>
to be the <hi>two eyes,</hi> or the Sun and Moon of their Church; nay by
a ſtrange tranſportment of Folly, (to the forfeiture of the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Learning and Reaſon) they have ſo <hi>multiplied</hi> Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that we have whole <hi>Volumns</hi> of them, as the Revelations of
their <hi>Saint Brigit</hi> and others; and by wonderful credulity they have
not only advanced apparent <hi>dreams</hi> and dotages to the honour of
<hi>Inſpirations</hi> or Viſions, but upon this <hi>ſandy Foundation</hi> they have
built a great many of their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> as <hi>Purgatory, Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
auricular Confeſſion,</hi> &amp;c. By ſuch warrants have they inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Feſtivals,</hi> and <hi>founded</hi> ſeveral Orders; the particulars of theſe
things you may ſee more at large in <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet</hi> and others.
And that there might be nothing wanting that might make them
ſhameleſly impudent, they are not content to <hi>equal</hi> their <hi>Fooleries</hi>
with the Scriptures of God, as that the <hi>rule</hi> of their <hi>St. Francis</hi>
(for I ſhall only inſtance in him, omitting others for brevity ſake)
was not compoſed <hi>by the Wiſdom of Man,</hi> but by <hi>God himſelf,</hi> and
<hi>inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> but they advance <hi>their</hi> Prophets <hi>above the
Apoſtles,</hi> and above <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. Their <hi>St. Benedict</hi> (if you will
believe them) was rapt up to the <hi>third Heavens,</hi> where he ſaw
God <hi>Face to Face,</hi> and heard the choire of Angels; and their <hi>St.
Francis</hi> was a <hi>none-ſuch</hi> for Miracles and Revelations. Neither may
we wonder that Satan ſhould be forward in urging this cheat,
when we conſider.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, What a <hi>reverence</hi> Men <hi>naturally</hi> carry to Revelations, and
how apt they are to be ſurpriſed with an <hi>haſty</hi> credulity. An <hi>old
Prophecy,</hi> pretended to be found in <hi>a Wall,</hi> or taken out of an <hi>old
Manuſcript</hi> (of I know now what uncertain Author,) is uſually
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49412:124"/>
                        <hi>more doted on,</hi> than the plain and infallible <hi>rules</hi> of Scripture: this
we may obſerve daily, and Forreiners do much blame the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
for a facile belief of ſuch things, but it is a general fault of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and we find even wiſe Men forward in their perſwaſions
upon meaner grounds, than thoſe that gain credit to old Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
For their <hi>antiquity</hi> and <hi>ſtrangeneſs</hi> of diſcovery, eſpecially at
ſuch times wherein the preſent poſture of Affairs ſeem to <hi>favour</hi>

matter for Satan to beguile Men into an expectation of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<hi>inſpirations,</hi> and a belief of what is pretended ſo to be: for

upon by this pretence, is an high motive to him to practiſe
upon it. For Inſpirations, Viſions, Voices, Impulſes, Dreams,
and Revelations are things wherein wicked <hi>Impoſtors</hi> may by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<hi>they do but lye, and the Lord never ſent them, nor commanded them;</hi> nay
'tis eaſy by <hi>tricks</hi> and <hi>illuſions,</hi> to put that honour and credit upon

with all their art of ſeeming ſeriouſneſs: the <hi>inventions</hi> of Men
(that have been formerly ſucceſsful in this deceit) being now <hi>laid
open</hi> to our knowledg, may make us more wary in our truſt.
Among the <hi>Heathens</hi> you may find notable ways of deceits of this
nature. The Story of <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Pſappho</hi> is commonly known,
they tamed Birds, and learned them to ſpeak, <hi>Hanno and Pſappho
are Gods;</hi> and then ſet them at liberty, that Men hearing ſuch
<hi>ſtrange voices</hi> in the Woods from Birds, might imagine that theſe
Men were declared <hi>Gods</hi> by ſpecial diſcovery. <hi>Mahomets</hi> device
of making a <hi>Dove</hi> to come frequently to his Ear, (which he did,
by training her up to an uſe of picking Corn out of it,) ſerved him
for an evidence (among the vulgar beholders, who knew not the
true cauſe of it) of his immediate Inſpiration by the <hi>Angel Gabriel,</hi>
who (as he told them) whiſpered in his ear in the <hi>ſhape of a Dove.</hi>
The like knavery he practiſed for the confirmation of the truth of
his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> by making a Bull (taught before to come at a call or
ſign) to come to him, with a Chapiter upon his Horns. <hi>Hector
Boetius</hi> tells us of a like ſtratagem of a King of <hi>Scots,</hi> who (to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate
his fainting Subjects againſt the <hi>Picts</hi> that had beaten
them,) cauſed a Man clothed in the <hi>ſhining skin of Fiſhes,</hi> and
with rotten Wood (which as a Glow-worm in the Night, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
a faint Light) to come among them in the dark, and through
a <hi>Reed</hi> or hollow Trunk (that the Voice might not appear to be
humane) to incite them to a vigorous onſet: this they took to be
an <hi>Angel,</hi> bringing them this command from Heaven, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
fought and prevailed. Crafty <hi>Benedict,</hi> (who was afterward
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49412:125"/>
                        <hi>Pope</hi> under the name of <hi>Boniface the eighth)</hi> made ſimple <hi>Celeſtine
the fifth</hi> give over the <hi>Popedom,</hi> by conveying to him a Voice
through a Reed to this purpoſe: <hi>Celeſtine, Celeſtine, renounce the
Papacy, give it over, if thou wouldſt be ſaved, the burthen is beyond thy
Strength, &amp;c.</hi> The ſilly Man taking this for a Revelation from
Heaven, quitted his Chair and left it for that crafty Fox <hi>Benedict.</hi>
Not very many years ſince, the ſame trick was played in this
Country to <hi>a Man of Revelations,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Paul Hobſon.</note> who called himſelf <hi>David in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
when he had wearied his Entertainer with a long ſtay, he
quitted himſelf of his Company, (as I was credibly informed) by
a Policy which he perceived would well ſuit with the Man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſs;
for through a <hi>Reed</hi> in the <hi>night time</hi> he tells him, that
he muſt go into <hi>Wales,</hi> or ſome ſuch Country, and there preach
the Goſpel; the next Morning the Man <hi>avouches a Revelation from
God</hi> to go elſewhere, and ſo departs. Theſe inſtances ſhew you
how cunningly a cheating knave may carry on a pretence of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
or Viſion. And yet this is not all the advantage which
the Devil hath in this matter, though it is an advantage which he
ſometime makes uſe of when he is fitted with ſuitable Inſtruments.
But he works moſt <hi>dangerouſly</hi> when he ſo acts upon Men, that they
<hi>themſelves</hi> believe they have Viſions, Raptures and Revelations,
for ſome are <hi>really</hi> perſwaded that it is ſo with them. Neither is
it ſtrange, that Men ſhould be deluded into an apprehenſion that
they hear and ſee what they do not; in <hi>Feavers, Frenzies,</hi> and
<hi>Madneſs,</hi> we clearly ſee it to be ſo: and who can <hi>convince</hi> ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of their <hi>miſtakes,</hi> when with as high a confidence as may be,
they contend <hi>that they are not deceived?</hi> Shall we think it ſtrange
that Satan hath ways of conveying falſe apprehenſions upon Mens
minds? no ſurely, do we not ſee that the <hi>Senſes</hi> may be cheated,
and that the <hi>Fancies</hi> of Men may be corrupted? is it not eaſy for
him to convey <hi>Voices</hi> to the Ear, or <hi>ſhapes</hi> and repreſentations to
the Eye? and in ſuch caſes, what can ordinarily hinder a belief
that they hear or ſee ſuch things? but he needs not always work
upon the Fancy by the Senſes. If he hath the advantage of a <hi>cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy
diſtempered Fancy</hi> (as commonly he hath in <hi>Melancholly Perſons)</hi>
he can ſo <hi>ſtrongly fix</hi> his ſuggeſtions upon them, and ſo <hi>effectually</hi> ſet
the Fancy on work to <hi>embrace</hi> them, that without any appearance
of Madneſs, they will perſwade themſelves that they have <hi>diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
from God, <hi>Impulſes</hi> by his Spirit, <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſet upon their
Hearts, and what not? and becauſe they <hi>feel</hi> the workings of theſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49412:125"/>
things within them, it is impoſſible to make them ſo much <hi>as ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi>
that they are deceived. Do but conſider the power of <hi>any
Fancy</hi> in a <hi>Melancholick</hi> Perſon, and you may eaſily apprehend how
Satan works in ſuch deluſions. Melancholy doth ſtrangely <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi>
the imagination, and will beget in Men wonderful miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
and that ſometimes doth bewitch them into peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<hi>uncontroulable</hi> belief of their Fancy; 'tis a vehement, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
humour, what way ſoever it takes, the imagination thus
corrupted hath an enormous <hi>ſtrength,</hi> ſo that if it fix upon things
never ſo abſurd or irrational, 'tis not reducible by the ſtrongeſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
If ſuch a Man conceits himſelf <hi>dead,</hi> or that he is <hi>transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
to a <hi>Wolf</hi> or Cat, or that he is made of <hi>Glaſs</hi> (as many in this
Diſtemper have done;) there is no perſwaſion to the contrary, that
can take place with him. Now if this humour be taken up with
<hi>Divine matters</hi> (as uſually it doth, for it hath a <hi>natural inclination
to religious things)</hi> it ſtill acts with <hi>fierceneſs</hi> and <hi>confidence,</hi> and there
are many things often concomitant to ſuch actings, that if it miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit
Inſpiration or Prophecy, the <hi>Parties</hi> themſelves are not
only <hi>bound up</hi> under that perſwaſion, but even <hi>unwary Spectators</hi>
are deluded. For ſometime a Melancholy <hi>imagination</hi> is not <hi>wholly</hi>
corrupt, but only in reſpect of ſome <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> particulars, whilſt in
<hi>other</hi> things it acts <hi>regularly,</hi> and then neither they nor others
(that are unacquainted with ſuch caſes) are ſo apt to ſuſpect that
they are <hi>miſtaken</hi> in theſe things, while they act <hi>rationally</hi> and <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly</hi>
in <hi>other</hi> matters. Sometime they have vehement <hi>fits of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal</hi>
(for the humour hath its ebbings and flowings) and this
gives them occaſion to apprehend that ſometing doth <hi>ſupernaturally</hi>
act or raiſe them, and then when the things they ſpeak, are for
the <hi>matter</hi> of them, of <hi>religious concern,</hi> and <hi>odd notions</hi> (for the
humour flies high, and bounds not it ſelf with ordinary things,)
and withal uttered in <hi>Scripture Rhetorick</hi> and with <hi>fervency</hi> and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of Spirit, when theſe things <hi>concur,</hi> there is ſuch an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> that the Parties themſelves and others reſt fully
perſwaded that it is ſo.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Pretended and counterfeit <hi>Miracles</hi> the Devil makes
much uſe of, to countenance Errour, and this is alſo one of his
ſtrong-holds; for he ſuggeſts that God himſelf <hi>bears witneſs</hi> by theſe

is that of <hi>Paul</hi> concerning <hi>Antichriſt, 2 Theſ.</hi> 2. 9. where he tells
us of powerful <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Wonders</hi> by the <hi>working of Satan;</hi> who
doth all the while only lye and cheat, that he may draw Men to
Errour.</p>
                     <p>If we make enquiry how Satan hath managed this Engine, we
ſhall obſerve not only his diligence in uſing it, on <hi>all occaſions</hi> to
countenance all kind of Errours both in <hi>Paganiſme</hi> and <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>

is it with them to play tricks with Women troubled with

<hi>Holy-water</hi> againſt the Devil (with whom they would have all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſhe was poſſeſſed) when the event diſcovered, that her Fits
were only the Fits of the <hi>Mother.</hi> I my ſelf (and ſome others in
this place) have ſeen thoſe Fits allayed by the Fume of Tobacco
blown into her Mouth, to the ſhame and apparent detection of
that Artifice. I might mention the <hi>Legerdemain</hi> of <hi>Antonius</hi> of
<hi>Padua,</hi> who made his <hi>Horſe</hi> adore the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> for the converſion of an
Heretick; the finding of the Images of <hi>St. Paul</hi> and <hi>St. Dominick</hi>
in a Church at <hi>Venice</hi> with this Inſcription for <hi>Paul, By this Man
you may come to Chriſt;</hi> and this for <hi>Dominick, But by this Man you

on <hi>Straw, found</hi> at his Execution, (in all probability) by him that
<hi>made it</hi> and threw it down, or by his <hi>Confederate:</hi> but theſe are
enough to ſhew the honeſty of theſe kind of Men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They have alſo a cunning of aſcribing <hi>effects</hi> to
wrong <hi>cauſes,</hi> and by that means they make thoſe things Wonders
that are none. <hi>Mahomet</hi> called his Fits of <hi>Falling-Sickneſs, Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi>
or Trances. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us the Heathens were notable at this:

                        <note place="margin">Portenta falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> when his Agents can go no further in the Trade of
Miracle-making, he as a Spirit, doth often make uſe of his Power,
Knowledg, and Agility, by which he can indeed do things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
and to be wondred at. 'Tis nothing for him by his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of affairs at a diſtance, of the private endeavours, or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
reſolves of Princes, to <hi>prognoſticate</hi> future events: by his power

advantages do much to bring a Man into a <hi>Trance,</hi> or take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of a Fit of an <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> and then like a cunning Jugler,
pretend (by I know not what, nor whom) to raiſe a Man from
death. He knows the ſecret Powers and <hi>Vertues</hi> of things, and
by <hi>private applications</hi> of them may eaſily ſupply Spirits, remove
obſtructions, and ſo cure Lameneſs, Blindneſs, and many other
Diſtempers, and then give the honour of the Cure to what Perſon
or Occaſion may beſt fit his deſign; ſo that either by the <hi>officious Lyes</hi>
of his Vaſſals, or the <hi>exerting</hi> of his own Power on ſuitable Objects
at fit times, he hath made a great noiſe of Signs and Wonders in
the World. And this ſtratagem of his, hath ever been at hand
to gain a repute to falſe doctrine. And the rather doth he inſiſt
upon this,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="234" facs="tcp:49412:129"/>
Firſt, Becauſe true Miracles are a <hi>Divine Teſtimony</hi> to Truth. As
<hi>Nichodemus</hi> argued Joh. 3. 2. <hi>No Man could do theſe Miracles that
thou doeſt, except God be with him.</hi> And there were <hi>ſolemn</hi> occaſions
wherein they were <hi>neceſſary;</hi> as when God gave publick diſcoveries
of his mind <hi>before</hi> the Scriptures were written; and alſo when he
<hi>altered</hi> the Oeconomy of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and ſetled that of the
<hi>New.</hi> In theſe caſes it was neceſſary that God ſhould confirm his
Word by Miracles. But now, though theſe ends of Miracles are
ceaſed, though God hath ſo ſetled and <hi>fixed</hi> the rule of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Worſhip, that no <hi>other Goſpel</hi> or Rule is to be expected,
and conſequently no <hi>need</hi> of new Miracles, where the <hi>certain</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Old</hi> Miracles are ſufficient <hi>atteſtations</hi> of old and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
Truths; nay though God have expreſly told us, <hi>Deut. 13.
1.</hi> that no Miracle (though it ſhould <hi>come to paſs,</hi> and could not
be diſcovered to be a Lye) ſhould prevail with us to forſake the
eſtabliſhed truths and ways of Scripture, or to entertain any thing
contrary to it; yet doth Satan exerciſe herein a <hi>proud imitation</hi>
of the Supream Majeſty, and withal doth ſo <hi>dazle</hi> the minds of
the weaker ſort of Men, (who are more apt to conſider the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
than to ſuſpect the Deſign) that (without due heed given
to the cautions which God hath laid before us in that particular)
they are ready to interpret them to be Gods witneſs to this or that
Doctrine to which they ſeem to be appendant.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe Satan hath a more than ordinary advantage
to <hi>feign</hi> Miracles, he doth more induſtriouſly ſet himſelf to pretend
them, and to urge them, for the accompliſhment of his ends.
'Tis an eaſy work to prevail with Men that are wholly devoted
to their own Intereſt under the Mask of Religion, to ſay and do
any thing that may further their deſign; and the buſineſs of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
is ſo imitable <hi>by Art,</hi> through the <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>heedleſneſs</hi> of
Men, that with a ſmall labour Satan can do it at pleaſure. The
ſecret Powers of Nature (ſuch as that of the <hi>Loadſtone)</hi> by a dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
application brought into act, in a fitly contrived Subject,
will ſeem Miraculous to thoſe that ſee not the <hi>ſecret ſprings</hi> of thoſe
actions. There have been <hi>artificial</hi> contrivances of Motions,
which had they been diſguiſed under a <hi>religious form,</hi> and directed
to ſuch an end, might have paſſed for greater Miracles than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which we have mentioned. Such was the <hi>Dove</hi> of <hi>Architas</hi>
which did fly in the Air,<note place="margin">Heylin Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mography. <hi>pag.</hi> 399</note> as if it had been a living Creature. Such
was the <hi>Flie</hi> of <hi>Regiomontanus,</hi> and the <hi>Eagle</hi> preſented to the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49412:129"/>
Emperour <hi>Maximilan,</hi> which in the compaſs of their little Bodies,
contained ſo many Springs and Wheels as were ſufficient to give
them Motion, and to direct their courſes as if they had been anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> his Artificial Man, and the Silver <hi>Gally,</hi> and
<hi>Tritons</hi> made by a Goldſmith at <hi>Paris,</hi> were rare peices of Art, their
Motions ſo certain and ſteady, that they ſeemed to have Life and
Underſtanding. If Art can do all this, how much more may we
ſuppoſe can Satan do? how eaſily can he make Apparitions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtrange Sights to the Eye, and Voices to the Ear? and by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out his Power do a thouſand things aſtoniſhing and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?</p>
                     <p>Eightly, Sometime Satan pleads for Errour, from the <hi>eaſe,
peace,</hi> or other <hi>advantages</hi> which Men pretend they have received,
ſince they engaged in ſuch a way, or received ſuch a perſwaſion.
This is an Argument from the <hi>effect,</hi> and frequently uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Minds of Men in their Opinions. Hence they ſatisfy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with theſe reaſonings: <hi>I was before always under fears and
uncertainties, I never was at peace or reſt in my Mind, I tryed ſeveral
courſes, followed ſeveral Parties, but I never had ſatisfaction or comfort
till now, and by this I know that I am in a right way.</hi> Others ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
after the ſame manner from their abundance and outward
proſperity: <hi>I met with nothing but croſſes and loſſes before, but now
God hath bleſſed me with an increaſe of Subſtance, proſpered my Trade
and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakings,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe, though apparently weak and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
Grounds, are reputed ſtrong and concluſive, to thoſe that
are <hi>firſt reſolved</hi> upon an Errour. For Men are ſo willing to <hi>juſtify</hi>
themſelves in what they have undertaken, that they greedily <hi>catch</hi>
at any thing that hath the leaſt appearance of probability to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
their ends.</p>
                     <p>This plea of ſatisfaction is commonly from one of theſe two
things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, From <hi>inward Peace,</hi> and contentment of Mind. Satan
knows that Peace is the thing to which a Man ſacrificeth all his
labours and travel; this he ſeeks, (though often in a wrong way,
and by wrong means:) he knows alſo that true Peace is only the
Daughter of Truth, <hi>(the ways</hi> whereof <hi>are pleaſantneſs,</hi> and the
<hi>Paths</hi> whereof <hi>are Peace;)</hi> neither is he ignorant of the delights
which a Man hath, by enjoying himſelf in the ſweet repoſe of a
contented Mind, that he may charm the Hearts of the erroneous
into a confidence and aſſurance that they have taken a right courſe,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49412:130"/>
he doth all he can to further a falſe peace in them, and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he commonly uſeth this method:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He doth all he can to <hi>unſettle</hi> them from the Foundation
of Truth upon which they were bottomed; he labours to render
things <hi>ſuſpitious,</hi> doubtful or uncertain: this ſome have noted from
2 <hi>Theſ. chap. 2. ver.</hi> 2. where Satans firſt attempts are to <hi>ſhake</hi> their
<hi>Minds,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sclater in loc. <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>.</note> not only by diſquiet, (of which we are next to ſpeak)
but by <hi>alteration</hi> of their judgment, (for <hi>Mind</hi> is ſometimes taken

of Chriſt,</hi> and 1 Cor. 1. 10. <hi>in the ſame Mind, and in the ſame Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, His ſecond approach is to raiſe a ſtorm of reſtleſs <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet</hi>
upon that uncertainty; and in order to his intended deſign
he uſually fills them with the utmoſt <hi>anxiety</hi> of Mind, and makes
their Thoughts (like a tempeſtuous Sea) daſh one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>.</note> This peice of his Art is noted in the forecited place, <hi>that ye
be not ſhaken in mind or troubled;</hi> the word ſignifies a <hi>great perplexity.</hi>
And this is an uſual method which the falſe Teachers among the
<hi>Galatians</hi> practiſed, they firſt troubled them, and then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by the advantage of that trouble to pervert the Goſpel of
Chriſt.<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 7. &amp; 5. 12.</note> To effect both theſe, he doth amuſe them with all the
objections that can be raiſed. If he can ſay any thing of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
of the Errour, the Number, Wiſdom, Learning or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of thoſe that embrace it, they are ſure to hear of theſe things
to the full; the danger of continuing as they were, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the new Doctrine, are repreſented with all aggravating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
and theſe ſo often, that their thoughts have no reſt:
and if this reſtleſneſs does wound or weaken them, he purſues with
an high hand. Theſe ways of diſturbing the unſettled mind, are
hinted to us in the aforeſaid place, <hi>Spirit, Word, Letter,</hi> any
thing that carries a ſeeming Authority to unſettle, or power to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze
and diſtreſs. And we may here further note, that where
the minds of Men are diſcompoſed with <hi>other</hi> fears or diſquiets, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
is ready to improve them to this uſe, ſo that commonly when
the Word of God begins to work at firſt upon the conſciences of
Men, to awaken them to the conſideration of their Sin and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
the Adverſary is then very buſy with them to inveagle them
into ſome Errour or other.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Having throughly prepared the mind with reſtleſs fears,
he then advanceth forward with the <hi>proffers of peace and comfort</hi> in
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49412:130"/>
the way of Errour which he propoſeth; and in this caſe Errour will
boaſt much, <hi>Come to me, and ye ſhall find reſt for your ſouls.</hi> How grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and welcome the confident proffers of eaſe and ſatisfaction are
to a toſſed and diſquieted mind any Man will eaſily imagine?
'Tis uſually thus, Men that are tired out, will eaſily embrace any
thing for eaſe. A Man in this caſe may be wrought upon like Wax
to receive any Impreſſion; he will faſten on any thing true or falſe
that doth but promiſe comfort.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The compleatment of his method is to pleaſe the
Man in the <hi>fruition</hi> of the peace promiſed: and this he labours to
do, not only to <hi>fix</hi> the Man in his deluſion, but to make that Man
<hi>brag</hi> of eaſe to be a ſnare to others. And 'tis eaſy for the Devil to
do this: for, Firſt, The <hi>novelty</hi> of a new Opinion doth naturally
pleaſe, eſpecially if it give any ſeeming commendation for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
or ſingularity. We ſee Men are fond of their own Inventions,
and delighted to be lifted up above others. Secondly, Satan can
eaſily <hi>allay</hi> the ſtorm which he himſelf <hi>raiſed:</hi> he gives over to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
with anxious thoughts, on the contrary he ſuggeſts thoughts
of ſatisfaction. Thirdly, And whatever he can do in a <hi>natural
way</hi> to raiſe up our paſſions of joy and delight, he will be ſure to
do it now, to <hi>raviſhment</hi> and exceſs if he can; and then he not
only makes theſe Men ſure, (for what argument can ſtand before
ſuch a confidence?) but hath an active inſtrument for the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch as cannot diſcover theſe methods.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Outward proſperity</hi> is the other common plea for Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
Though ſucceſſes, plenty and abundance of worldly comforts,
argue of themſelves neither love nor hatred, truth nor falſhood,
becauſe the wiſe Providence of God, for holy ends and reaſons
(often undiſcerned by us) permits often the <hi>Tabernacles of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to proſper,</hi> and permits thoſe <hi>that deal treacherouſly</hi> with the
Truths of God, <hi>to be planted, to take root, to grow, yea, to bring forth
Fruit;</hi> nevertheleſs if in a way of Errour they meet with outward
Bleſſings, they are apt to a ſcribe all to their Errours, and to ſay as
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 5. <hi>I will go after my Lovers that gave me my Bread and
my Water, my Wool and my Flax, mine Oyl and my Drink,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſerious conſideration of God's common Bounty, which
upon far other accounts, <hi>gives them Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, and
multiplies their Silver and Gold, which they prepared for</hi> Baal, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.
I ſhall not need to add any thing further for the proof and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
of this, than what we have in <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 17. where the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49412:131"/>
Jews expreſly advance their Idolatrous Worſhip as the right way,
and confirm themſelves even to <hi>obſtinacy</hi> in the purſuit of it, upon
this reaſon; <hi>We will certainly do whatſoever thing goeth out of our own
Mouth, to burn Incenſe to the Queen of Heaven—for then had we
plenty of Victuals, and were well, and ſaw no evil: but ſince we left off
to burn Incenſe to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out our drink-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been conſumed by the
Sword, and by the Famine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ninthly, Inſtead of better arguments, Satan uſually makes <hi>Lyes
his refuge:</hi> and theſe reſpect either the <hi>Truth</hi> which he would cry
down, or the <hi>Errour</hi> which he would ſet up.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Lyes that are managed againſt Truth, are of two ſorts;
miſtakes and miſrepreſentations of its <hi>Doctrines,</hi> or <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
againſt the <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> of thoſe that take part
with it.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Lyes that are proper to beſpatter a <hi>Truth</hi> withal, are ſuch
as tend to render it <hi>unlovely, inconvenient,</hi> or <hi>dangerous.</hi> Satan hath
never been awanting to raiſe up miſts and fogs to eclipſe the ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beauty of Truth. Sometime he perſwades Men that it is a
<hi>novelty,</hi> and contrary <hi>to the tradition of the Fathers:</hi> and then if an
Errour had been once upon the ſtage before, and had again been
hiſſed out of the World, when it peeps out again into the World,
its former impudency is made an argument for its antiquity, and
Truth is decryed as novel. Or, if it be but an Errour of yeſterday,
and hath only obtained an Age or two, then the <hi>Ghoſts</hi> of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
are conjured up as witneſſes, and the plea runs currant,
<hi>What is become of your Fathers? or, are you wiſer than your Fathers? are
they all Damned?</hi> Theſe were inſiſted on by the <hi>Heathens:</hi> the Gods
of the <hi>Country,</hi> and the Worſhip of their <hi>Fathers,</hi> they thought
ſhould not be forſaken for Chriſtianity, which they judged was
but a <hi>novelty</hi> in compariſon of <hi>Paganiſme.</hi> Of the ſame extract is
that <hi>old ſong</hi> of the Papiſts, <hi>Where was your Religion before Luther?</hi>
And to this purpoſe they talk of the ſucceſſion of their <hi>Biſhops</hi>
and <hi>Popes.</hi> And other Errours grow a little <hi>pert</hi> and confident, if
they can but find a <hi>pattern</hi> or ſample for themſelves among the
<hi>old Hereſies.</hi> Sometimes he endeavours to bring Truth into ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by rendering it a dangerous <hi>encroachment</hi> upon the <hi>rights</hi> and
priviledges of Men, as if it would turn all upſide down, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
Factions and Confuſions. This clamour was raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Goſpel, that it would <hi>ſubvert</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49412:131"/>
the Law.</hi> Sometimes he cloaths the opinions of Truth with an <hi>ugly
dreſs,</hi> and miſrepreſents it to the World, as guilty of ſtrange infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and <hi>abſurdities,</hi> which only ariſe from a <hi>wrong ſtating</hi> of the
queſtions: and where it doth <hi>really</hi> differ from Errour, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to <hi>widen</hi> the differences to an inconvenient diſtance, ſo that
if it go <hi>a Mile</hi> from Errour, Satan will have it to <hi>go two;</hi> if Truth
teach <hi>Juſtification by Faith,</hi> Errour repreſents it as <hi>denying</hi> all care
of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>good Works;</hi> if Truth ſay, <hi>bare moral Vertues</hi> are
not ſufficient <hi>without Grace,</hi> Errour preſently accuſeth it, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
any <hi>neceſſary uſe of Morality,</hi> or affirming that <hi>moral</hi> Vertues
are <hi>obſtructions</hi> and hinderances to Salvation. It were eaſie to note
abundance of ſuch Inſtances.</p>
                     <p>As for calumnies againſt the <hi>Perſons</hi> and Actions of thoſe that
are Aſſertors of Truth, 'tis well known for an old thread-bare
deſign, by which Satan hath gained not a little. <hi>Machiavil</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
the policy from him, and formed it into a Maxime, for he
found by experience that where ſtrong Slanders had ſet in their
Teeth, though never ſo unjuſtly, the Wounds were never
<hi>throughly healed:</hi> for ſome that heard the report of the <hi>Slander,</hi>
never heard the <hi>Vindication,</hi> and thoſe that did, were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſo <hi>unprejudiced</hi> as to free themſelves from <hi>all ſuſpition,</hi> but
ſtill ſomething remained uſually upon their Spirits for ever after;
and that, like a ſecret venome, poyſons all that could be ſaid or
done by the Perſons, that (wrongfully) fell under their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
and did not a little derogate from the authority and power
of the Truths which they delivered.</p>
                     <p>The Friends of Truth have always to their coſt found it ſo.
Chriſt himſelf eſcaped not the lyes and cenſures of Men when he
did the greateſt Miracles; they raiſed this calumny againſt him,
<hi>That he caſt out Devils by</hi> Beelzebub <hi>the Prince of Devils:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 48.</note> when he
ſhewed the moſt compaſſionate condeſcentions, they called him <hi>a
Man gluttonous, a Wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners;</hi>
and at laſt upon a miſinterpretation of his ſpeeches, <hi>(I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
this Temple, and in three days I will build it up,</hi> Mat. 26. 61.)
they arraigned and condemned him for <hi>Blaſphemy:</hi> and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
have (according to what he foretold) drunk of the ſame
Cup; the more eminent in ſervice, the greater draught. <hi>Paul,</hi> a
choſen veſſel, met with much of this unjuſt dealing; he was accuſed
<hi>Act.</hi> 21. 28. as ſpeaking againſt the <hi>People,</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> and the
<hi>Temple;</hi> and, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. 5. called <hi>a peſtilent Fellow, a mover of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49412:132"/>
a prophaner of the Temple.</hi> Neither can we wonder at this,
that the greateſt Innocency, or higheſt degree of Holineſs, is no
Armour of proof againſt the ſharp Arrows of a lying Tongue:
When we read this as one of Satan's great Characters, that he is
<hi>the Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> and that his Agents are ſo perfectly
inſtructed in this Art, that they are alſo branded with the ſame
mark of <hi>falſe Accuſers,</hi> Jude 10. 'Tis well known how the
Primitive Chriſtians were uſed, they were accounted <hi>the filth and
off-ſcouring of all things;</hi> there could be nothing that could render
them odious or ridiculous but they were aſperſed with it, as that
they <hi>ſacrificed Infants, worſhipped the Sun,</hi> and <hi>uſed promiſcuous
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs;</hi> nay, what ever <hi>Plague</hi> or diſaſter befel their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
they were ſure to carry the <hi>blame.</hi> And we might trace this
Stragem down to our own days. <hi>Luther</hi> in his time was the
common Butt for all the poyſoned Arrows of the Papiſts calumny;
which ſo exceeded all bounds of Sobriety and Prudence, that
they deviſed a <hi>Romance</hi> of his Death, how he was choaked of the
Devil; that before he died, he deſired his Corps might be carried
into the Church, and adored with divine Worſhip; and that after
his Death the exceſſive ſtench of his Carcaſe forced all his Friends
to forſake him. All this and more to this purpoſe they publiſhed
<hi>while he was alive,</hi> whoſe Slanders (worthy only of laughter)
he refuted by his own Pen. The like fury they expreſſed againſt
<hi>Calvin,</hi> by their <hi>Bolſecus,</hi> whom they ſet on work to fill a Book
with impudent lyes againſt him: Neither did <hi>Beza, Junius,</hi> or
any other of note eſcape without ſome ſlander or other. How
unjuſtly the <hi>Arrians</hi> of old accuſed <hi>Athanaſius</hi> of Uncleanneſs,
and of bereaving <hi>Arſenius</hi> of his Arm,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Theod. Hiſt.</hi> lib. cap. 30.</note> is ſufficiently known in
Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>But the Devils malice doth not always run in the dirty chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
of odious Calumnies, he hath ſometimes a more <hi>cleanly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance</hi>
for his Lyes againſt holy Men. In proſecution of the ſame
deſign, 'tis a fair colour for Errour, if he can abuſe the name and
credit of renowned Champions of Truth, by <hi>fathering</hi> an Errour
upon them which they never owned. By this means he doth not
only <hi>grace</hi> a falſe Doctrine with the <hi>authority</hi> of an eminent Perſon,
whoſe eſtimation might be a ſnare to ſome well-meaning Perſons,
but weakens the Truth, by bringing a faithful Aſſertor of it into
ſuſpition of holding (at leaſt in ſome points) dangerous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
by which many are affrighted from entertaining any thing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49412:132"/>
that they write or preach: For, though they may be confeſſedly
ſound in the moſt weighty Doctrines, yet if it be once buzz'd
abroad that they are in any thing unſound, this dead Fly ſpoils
all the precious Ointment: and the matter were yet the leſs, if
there were any juſt cauſe for ſuch a prejudice; but ſuch is Satans
Art, that if a Man explains the ſame Truth but in <hi>different words</hi>
and forms of ſpeech, than thoſe that others have been uſed unto;
or if he caſts it into a <hi>more convenient Mould,</hi> that (by laying aſide
doubtful or flexible expreſſions) it may be more ſafely guarded
from the exceptions of the Adverſaries, eſpecially if he carefully
chuſe his path betwixt the <hi>extreams</hi> on either hand; this is enough
for Satan to catch at, and preſently he beſtows upon him the names
of the <hi>very Errours</hi> which he moſt ſtrenuouſly <hi>oppoſeth;</hi> nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
if he mention any thing above the <hi>reach</hi> or acquaintance of
thoſe that hear him, 'tis well if he eſcapes the charge of Hereſie, and
that he meets not with the lot of <hi>Virgilius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Saltzbury,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Harvaei Praefat.</hi> in Sang. Circulo. &amp; <hi>Heylin Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogr.</hi> p. 399.</note> who
was judged no leſs than heretical, for venting his opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Antipodes.</hi> I know Men do ſuch things in their zeal,
but while they do ſo, they are concerned to conſider how Satan
doth abuſe their good meaning to the diſſervice of Truth.</p>
                     <p>As Satan's deſign in beſpattering the Actions and Doctrines of
good Men, is to bring the Truth they profeſs into a ſuſpition of
falſhood, and to advance the contrary Errours to the place and
credit of Truth; ſo doth he uſe a <hi>skill</hi> proportionable to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
And though he be ſo <hi>impudent</hi> that he will not bluſh at the
contrivance of the moſt groſs and malicious lye, yet withall he is ſo
<hi>cunning,</hi> that he ſtudiouſly endeavours ſome probable riſe for his
ſlanders, and commonly he takes this courſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He doth all he can to <hi>corrupt</hi> the Profeſſors of Truth;
if Riches or Honours will tempt them to be Proud, High-minded,
Contentions, or Extravagant, he plyes them with theſe Weapons;
if the pleaſures of the Fleſh and World be more likely to beſot
them, or to make them ſenſual, earthly or looſe, he inceſſantly
lays thoſe Baits before them; if Fears and Perſecutions can affright
them out of duty; if Injuries and Provocations may prejudice
them into a forward or wayward temper, he will certainly urge
them by ſuch occaſions, and when he hath prevailed in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
he is ſure to aggravate every circumſtance to its utmoſt
height, and upon that advantage to make additions of a great
many things beyond what they can be juſtly accuſed of. This old
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49412:133"/>
device <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 24. takes notice of concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi>
whoſe breach of the Law ſo diſhonoured God, that <hi>the Name of God
was blaſphemed among the</hi> Gentiles <hi>through them.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> lived
wickedly, and their wicked lives was a currant argument among
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to confirm them in <hi>Paganiſm;</hi> for they judged the
Law of God could not approve it ſelf to be better than their
own, when the Profeſſors of it were ſo naught. To prevent this
miſchief,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 1.</note> we are ſeriouſly warned to be carefully ſtrict in all our
ſtations,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>that the Name of God and his Doctrine be not blaſphemed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Whatever miſcarriages <hi>any Profeſſor</hi> of Truth is guilty
of, Satan takes care that it be preſently charged upon <hi>all the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
If any <hi>one</hi> offend, it is matter of <hi>publick</hi> blame; much more
if any <hi>Company</hi> or Party ſhall run into extravagancies, or do acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſtrange and unjuſtifyable, thoſe that agree with them in the
<hi>general name</hi> of their Profeſſion (though they differ as far from
their wild Opinions and Practices as their enemies do) ſhall ſtill
be upbraided with <hi>their</hi> Follies. We ſee this practiſed daily by
differing Parties, according to what was foretold, in 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 2.
Falſe Prophets</hi> ſeduce a great number of Chriſtians to follow <hi>their
pernicious ways,</hi> and by reaſon of their wild ungodly behaviour,
<hi>the whole way of Truth was evil ſpoken of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The leaſt ſlip or <hi>infirmity</hi> of the Children of Truth
the Devil is ready to bring upon the Stage; and they that will
not charge <hi>themſelves</hi> as offenders for very <hi>great</hi> evils, will yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the diſparagement of Truth the ſmalleſt miſtakes of <hi>others;</hi>
a <hi>mote</hi> in the eye of the lovers of Truth ſhall be eſpyed, when a
<hi>beam</hi> in the eye of falſhood ſhall paſs for nothing.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Slanderous Aſperſions are ſometimes raiſed from a
ſimple <hi>miſtake</hi> of Actions, and their <hi>grounds</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
and ſometimes from a malicious <hi>Miſrepreſentation.</hi> The
Devil ſeldom acts from a ſimple miſtake, but he will either
ſuborn the paſſionate Oppoſers to a <hi>wilful perverting</hi> of the true
management of things, or will by a <hi>falſe account</hi> of things take
the advantage of their prejudice, to make Men believe that ſuch
things have been ſaid or done, which indeed never were. The
Chriſtians in the Primitive times were reported to be bloody
Men, and that they did kill Men in Sacrifice, and did eat their
Fleſh and drink their Blood; and this was only occaſioned by their
<hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.
They were accuſed for <hi>promiſcuous uncleanneſs</hi> with one another,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49412:133"/>
and this only becauſe they taught that there was no diſtinction of
<hi>Male and Female</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Juſtication,</hi> and that they were all
<hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Siſters</hi> in Chriſt.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Apolog.</hi> cap. 7, 8, 9, 39.</note> This account <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives of the
Calumnies of thoſe times, and others have noted the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of other abuſes of them. They were reported to worſhip the
Sun, becauſe they in times of perſecution were forced to meet
<hi>early</hi> in the Fields, and were often ſeen undiſperſed at Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing.
They were reported to worſhip <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Elements of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the Lords Supper.
If they met in <hi>private places,</hi> and in the <hi>night,</hi> it was enough to
occaſion ſurmiſes of <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> and Rebellion: ſo ready is Satan
to take occaſion where none is given.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, But if none of theſe are at hand, then a <hi>downright Lye</hi>
muſt do the turn, according to that of <hi>Jer. 18. 18. Come and let
us deviſe devices againſt</hi> Jeremiah: and when once the lye is coyned,
Satan hath officious Inſtruments to ſpread it; <hi>Jer. 20. 10. Report,
ſay they, and we will report it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe were the Lyes raiſed againſt Truth; but beſides this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
he uſeth the ſame Art of <hi>lying</hi> to inhance the <hi>credit of
Errour. Lying Inſpirations, Lying Signs</hi> and Wonders we have
ſpoken of, I ſhall only mention another ſort of Lying, which is
that of <hi>Forgery,</hi> an Art which Errour hath commonly made uſe
of. Sometimes <hi>Books</hi> and Writings erroneous have been made to
carry the <hi>names</hi> of Men that <hi>never knew</hi> or ſaw them. The Apoſtles
themſelves eſcaped not theſe abuſes; you read of the counterfeit
<hi>Goſpels</hi> of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> the Acts of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi>
the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Conſtitutions, and a great many more. Later
Writers have by the like hard uſage been forced to father the
Brats of other Mens Brians.<note place="margin">Coci cenſura Patrum. Dr. <hi>James</hi> de corrupt. Scrip. concilior. <hi>Prideaux</hi> de Pſeudo. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphis.</note> I might be large in theſe, but they

                     <head>CHAP. IV. Of Satan's ſecond way of improving his Advantages, which
is by working upon the Underſtanding indirectly by the
Affections. This he doth (1.) By a ſilent inſenſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
of Errour. His method herein. (2.) By en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling

Pride and Anger. (8.) By adorning Errour with
the Ornaments of Truth.</head>
                     <p>THe uſual <hi>Arguments</hi> by which Satan doth <hi>directly</hi> blind the
Underſtanding to a perſwaſion to accept Darkneſs for Light,
we have now conſidered. It remains that ſome account be given
of the <hi>ſecond</hi> way of prevailing upon the Underſtanding, and that
is by <hi>ſwaying</hi> it through the power and prevalency of the <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
In order to this he hath many Devices, the principal where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By ſilent and <hi>inſenſible</hi> procedure he labours to introduce
Errours; and leſt Men ſhould <hi>ſtartle</hi> at a ſudden and full preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole, he thinks it policy to inſinuate into the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
by offering it in <hi>parcels.</hi> Thus he prevents wonderment
and ſurpriſal, (leſt Men ſhould boggle and turn away,) and
doth by degrees <hi>familiarize</hi> them to that, which at firſt would
have been rejected with abhorrency. We read in the Parable of the
Tares, that the envious Man which ſowed them (who was Satan)
took his opportunity <hi>while Men ſlept,</hi> and then went away in the
dark; inſomuch that the diſcovery was not made <hi>at the ſowing,</hi>
                        <pb n="245" facs="tcp:49412:134"/>
but <hi>at their coming</hi> up. In purſuance of this policy, we find the
principal Inſtruments of Satan have followed the footſteps of
their Maſter; they <hi>creep in unawares,</hi> Jude 4. they <hi>privily bring in
damnable Hereſies,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1. and as if they were guilty of ſome
modeſt ſhamefaſtneſs, they <hi>creep into houſes,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 6. The
ſteps by which the Devil creeps into the boſoms of Men to plant
Errour in the Heart, are theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He endeavours to gain the Heart by the <hi>ingenious</hi> ſweet
and delightful <hi>ſociety</hi> of thoſe that are corrupted already. Errour
hath a peculiar Art to <hi>woo the good-will</hi> before it diſcloſe it ſelf; it
firſt <hi>ſteals</hi> the Ear and Affections to the <hi>Perſon,</hi> and thence inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
derives it to the <hi>Opinion.</hi> Truth is Maſculine, and perſwades
<hi>by teaching,</hi> but Errour doth often <hi>teach by perſwading.</hi> 'Tis very
difficult to affect the Perſon, and not to beſtow upon the Errour
better thoughts than it deſerves. Thoſe therefore that are cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the Art of Seduction, make extraordinary pretences of
<hi>affectionate kindneſs,</hi> and (as the Apoſtle noted concerning the
Seducers of his time, <hi>Gal. 4. 17.) they zealouſly affect</hi> (thoſe whom
they would delude) <hi>but not well:</hi> Their Art doth alſo teach them
not to be <hi>over-haſty</hi> in <hi>propounding</hi> their Opinions, nor ſo much
as to touch upon them till they perceive they have gained a firm
perſwaſion of their aimity, and of the reality of thoſe kindneſſes
which they have made ſhew of: but when they have once gained
this point of advantage, they take opportunity more freely to
propound and preſs their Doctrines. Thus are Men at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled
<hi>with enticing words.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis alſo part of the ſame Deſign, that Satan ſometimes makes
uſe of <hi>Women Seducers:</hi> For, (1.) They are more apt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
themſelves; <hi>ſilly Women</hi> are ſoon <hi>led captive.</hi> (2.) Being
deceived, they are moſt earneſtly forward in the heat of zeal to
propagate their Opinions. (3.) And by the advantage of their
Nature they are moſt engaging, their affectionate Perſwaſions
uſually have a <hi>peculiar prevalency.</hi> The <hi>daughters of</hi> Moab (through
<hi>Balaam</hi>'s counſel) were made choice of, as the fitteſt Inſtruments
to ſeduce <hi>Iſrael</hi> to Idolatry. <hi>Solomon,</hi> though a wiſe Man, was
prevailed with by the importunity of his Wives, againſt his
former practice and knowledg, to favour falſe Worſhip. The
Woman <hi>Jezabel,</hi> Rev. 2. 20. was Satan's under-Agent, <hi>to
teach and ſeduce</hi> God's Servants <hi>to commit Fornication, and to eat
things ſacrificed to Idols.</hi> (4.) Beſides, they have a greater influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49412:135"/>
upon their Children, to leaven them with their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Satan alſo obſerves a <hi>gradual motion</hi> in fixing any
particular Errour. If he attempt it <hi>immediately</hi> without an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Agent, he firſt puts Men upon the <hi>reading</hi> or conſideration of
ſome <hi>dark Paſſages</hi> that ſeem to look favourably upon his deſign;
then he <hi>ſtarts the Notion</hi> or Objection; then begets a <hi>ſcruple</hi> or
queſtioning: Having once proceeded thus far, he follows his
Deſign with <hi>probable Reaſons,</hi> till he have formed it into an <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:</hi>
When 'tis come to this, a little more begets a <hi>perſwaſion,</hi>
that perſwaſion he ripens into a <hi>reſoluteneſs</hi> and obſtinacy, and
then at laſt fires it with <hi>zeal</hi> for the deluding of others. Having
thus laid the foundation by <hi>one</hi> Errour, he next endeavours to
<hi>multiply</hi> it, and then brings in the <hi>Inferences</hi> that unavoidably
follow: for as one Wedg makes way for another, ſo from one
Falſhood, another will eaſily force it ſelf, and from two or three,
who knows how many? And though the conſequences are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>more abſurd</hi> than the principles, yet are they with a ſmall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
brought into favour, where the principles are firſt <hi>confidently</hi>
believed; ſo that thoſe Errours, which becauſe of their ugly look,
Satan durſt not at firſt propound, leſt he ſhould ſcare Men off from
their reception, he can now with an undaunted boldneſs recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend.
It cannot be imagined that ever Men would <hi>at firſt</hi> have
entertained Opinions of <hi>contempt of Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Libertiniſm,</hi>
and therefore we may obſerve they uſually come in the <hi>rear</hi> of
<hi>other</hi> Opinions, which by a long tract of Art prepare their way.</p>
                     <p>Yet may we note, that though Satan uſually is forced to <hi>wait
the leaſure</hi> of ſome Mens timerouſneſs and baſhfulneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot ripen Errour to an haſty birth as he deſires, (hence
is it, that one Man often doth no more for his time, but only
<hi>brew</hi> it, or it may be makes only the <hi>rude draught</hi> of it, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>vents</hi> and adorns it: for ſo it was betwixt <hi>Laelius</hi> and <hi>Fauſtus
Socinus,</hi> betwixt <hi>David George</hi> and his Succeſſors:) And though
he be ſo confined to the <hi>firſt principles</hi> of Errour, which he hath
inſtilled, that he cannot at preſent enlarge them beyond their own
juſt conſequences; yet there are ſome <hi>choice</hi> principles of his,
which if he can but faſten upon the Mind, they preſently <hi>open the
gap</hi> to all kind of Errours imaginable; they are like the firing a
Train of Gunpowder, which in a Moment blows up the whole
Fabrick of Truth: ſuch are the deluſions of <hi>Enthuſiaſm, Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:49412:135"/>
and <hi>Prophetick Raptures;</hi> let theſe be once fixed, and then
there is nothing ſo Inhumane, Irreligious, Mad, or Ridiculous,
but Satan can with eaſe perſwade Men to it, and alſo under the
higheſt pretences of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Certainty;</hi> the experience of all
Ages, hath made any further proof of this altogether needleſs.</p>
                     <p>This is his way when he <hi>acts alone.</hi> But if he uſe <hi>Inſtruments,</hi>
though he is alſo gradual in his procedure, yet 'tis in a <hi>different
method:</hi> for there he ſometimes proceeds from the abuſe of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>innocent</hi> and lawful (by the help of a <hi>long tract of time)</hi> to
introduce the <hi>groſſeſt Falſhood.</hi> Thus may we conceive he brought
<hi>Idolatry</hi> to its height: firſt Men <hi>admired</hi> the wiſdom or famous acts
of their Progenitors, or Benefactors; next, they <hi>erected Pillars,</hi>
or Images of ſuch Perſons, to perpetuate the Names, Honour and
Memory of them and their Actions. Another Age being at a
<hi>greater diſtance</hi> from the things done, and conſequently greater
Strangers to the <hi>true ends</hi> and reaſons of ſuch practices, which
being (as it uſually falls out in ſuch caſes) abuſed by falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
or miſrepreſentations of things, (for Time covers things of
this nature with ſo thick a Miſt, that 'tis difficult to diſcover the
true <hi>Metal</hi> of an <hi>original Conſtitution)</hi> they in a devout ignorance
gave the Images a <hi>greater reſpect</hi> than was at firſt intended; then
did they ſlide into a conceit they were not of the <hi>ordinary rank</hi> of
Mortals, or at leaſt they were <hi>exalted</hi> to a condition which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Mortals were not capable of; thus they ſuppoſed them
<hi>Deities,</hi> and gave them <hi>worſhip</hi> of Prayers and Sacrifices: hence
they went further, and <hi>multiplied Gods,</hi> and that of ſeveral ſorts,
according to the natures of things that were good or hurtful to
them; and then at laſt conſulting <hi>how mean</hi> their offerings were,
and how unlikely to pleaſe their <hi>Godſhips,</hi> they concluded <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſacrifices</hi> moſt ſutable, eſpecially to expiate greater provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and in times of great calamity.</p>
                     <p>The burthenſom heap of ceremonious Superſtitions in <hi>Popery</hi>
was the work of <hi>ſeveral Ages,</hi> they were not brought in all at
once. One in a devotional heat fancied ſuch a Ceremony as a fit
teſtimony of Zeal, or a proper incitement of his Affections; Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deviſeth a ſecond, and ſo all along; as the minds of Men
were <hi>beſt pleaſed</hi> with their <hi>own inventions,</hi> and had ſo much <hi>credit</hi>
or authority to recommend them to others, they encreaſed the
ſum by <hi>new additions,</hi> till at laſt they are become a burthen not
to be born; and ſtill as they receeded from the <hi>primitive purity,</hi>
                        <pb n="248" facs="tcp:49412:136"/>
and became more careleſs and corrupt in their lives, (for from
<hi>good Biſhops</hi> they declined to but <hi>tollerable Arch-Biſhops,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matth. Pride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux</hi> Introduct. to Hiſtory.</note> till at laſt
they are become <hi>incurable Babylonians,)</hi> ſo they departed gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, and <hi>abounded</hi> in contrivances
of Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In corrupting <hi>eſtabliſhed Truths.</hi> Satan's proceedings are
not by <hi>ſudden</hi> and obſervable leaps, but by lingring and <hi>ſlow</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
as Flowers and Plants grow inſenſibly, and as Men gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
wax old and feeble. Violent and <hi>haſty</hi> alterations he knows
would beget <hi>Obſervation,</hi> Diſlike, and Oppoſition; neither will
he make <hi>ſuch attempts,</hi> but where he is ſure of a <hi>ſtrong prevalent</hi>
Party, which by force and power is able to carry all before it:
In this caſe he is willing to enforce Errour <hi>by Fire and Sword.</hi>
Thus he propagated <hi>Mahumetiſm</hi> at firſt, and ſtill continueth to
do ſo by the conquering Arms of the <hi>Turks;</hi> but where he hath
not this advantage, he betakes himſelf to another courſe, and
ſtudieth to do his work ſo that he may not be obſerved. The <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility</hi>
of ſuch a change, with the <hi>manner</hi> of effecting it, we may
obſerve in many Churches, that have declined from the Doctrine
which they <hi>at firſt</hi> received, but moſt of all in the Church at
<hi>Rome,</hi> which at firſt was a <hi>pure Church,</hi> as the Apoſtle teſtifieth,
but now ſo changed from the Truths upon which they were
bottomed in their <hi>firſt Conſtitution,</hi> as if ſhe had not been the ſame
Church. They boaſt indeed that as they were at firſt, ſo they are
now; but nothing is more evident than the contrary: and the
poſſibility of their <hi>inſenſible</hi> corruption is as demonſtrable as the
<hi>alteration</hi> of Doctrine in <hi>any other</hi> Church. The manifold ways
that Satan takes in this matter in the <hi>abuſe</hi> of Scripture, by raiſing
<hi>perverſe</hi> Interpretations, and <hi>unnatural</hi> Inferences, and the <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi>
of a <hi>long ſucceſſion</hi> in Authority; of the <hi>negligence</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi>
of the common People; of the <hi>crafty ſubtilty</hi> of the Teachers,
eſpecially when Religion began to be abuſed to <hi>ſecular</hi> Intereſt,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Stratagem Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanae.</hi> lib. 4.</note>
is deſcribed by <hi>Acontius</hi> and others. If we ſhould <hi>ſingle</hi> out any
of their noted Errours, and follow up the Hiſtory of it to its <hi>firſt
original,</hi> we ſhall find, that whatever ſtrong <hi>current</hi> it hath now
gotten, it was very ſmall and inconſiderable in the <hi>Fountain.</hi>
The <hi>Invocation</hi> of Saints, though it be now an eſtabliſhed Article
among them, yet its <hi>firſt riſe</hi> was from the <hi>unwary Proſopopoea's</hi> of
of the Ancients, and the liberty of their <hi>Oratorical declamatory
ſtile;</hi> theſe gave occaſion to ſome <hi>private Opinions,</hi> theſe Opinions
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:49412:136"/>
to ſome <hi>private</hi> devotional <hi>liberty</hi> in Practice, and from <hi>private
Opinions</hi> and Practices, at laſt it obtained ſo ſtrong a Party, that it
procured a <hi>publick Injunction.</hi> The like method was uſed for the
Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> whoſe beginning was from the
abuſe of ſuch <hi>Sentences</hi> as this in ancient Writers, <hi>That after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration
it was no more Bread and Wine, but the Body and Blood of
Chriſt;</hi> by which expreſſion the Authors intended no more than
this, that the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament were <hi>relatively
altered,</hi> and were more than <hi>ordinary Bread and Wine,</hi> becauſe they
were <hi>repreſentatives</hi> of the Body and Blood of Chriſt: however,
this gave them courage to interprect <hi>literally</hi> and ſtrictly theſe
words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body:</hi> and thus by degrees from the
<hi>Opinion</hi> of a <hi>few</hi> it became the <hi>judgment of many,</hi> and from the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
of a <hi>private Opinion</hi> of ſome Doctors and <hi>unimpoſed,</hi> it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
at laſt a <hi>Canon</hi> to make it Authentick, <hi>Publick Doctrine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, This inſenſible proceeding is in nothing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
than in the power of <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Education;</hi> Cuſtom doth by
degrees take off the <hi>ſtartling</hi> of Conſcience: and thoſe Opinions
or Practices which at firſt look affright it, are by a little familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
made more ſmooth and tollerable. The diſſents of Men by
frequent ſeeing and hearing, become <hi>tame</hi> and gentle; but the
force of Education is incomparably great, for this makes an Errour
to become as it were <hi>natural;</hi> they ſuck it in with their Milk,
and draw it in with their Air. This general advantage the
Devil hath over all the <hi>Children</hi> of erroneous Parents, eſpecially
where <hi>Countreys</hi> or Nations are of the ſame Perſwaſion; inſomuch
that <hi>Turks</hi> have as great belief of their <hi>Alcoran</hi> as we of the <hi>Bible,</hi>
and think as reverently of <hi>Mahomet</hi> as Chriſtians do of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
The Children of Idolatrous <hi>Pagans</hi> have as great a confidence of
the truth of their way of <hi>Heatheniſh Worſhip,</hi> as we have of <hi>God's
Ordinances</hi> and Inſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, We may ſee ſomething of this Stratagem of ſilent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglement
in Satan's <hi>Surpriſals;</hi> for ſometimes he inveagles Men
at <hi>unawares,</hi> and engageth them in Errour while they know not
what they are doing. Weak heads cannot ſee the far end of a
ſmooth-fac'd Doctrine; and they uſually embrace it by <hi>whole-ſale,</hi>
for <hi>ſome particular</hi> that ſtrikes upon their fancy, or gratifies their
humour. If they read a Book that hath ſome good things in it,
or is affectionate, for the ſake of <hi>theſe</hi> they <hi>ſwallow</hi> all the reſt
(though never ſo dangerous Doctrine) without further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49412:137"/>
The like advantage he hath from Actions that are bad
or tollerable, according to the various reſpects which they have
to the ends or conſequences that ly before them, for he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth intereſt Men in an erroneous conſequence, by <hi>concerning</hi>
them in actions that lead that way; and having thus beguiled
them into an evil miſtake, inſtead of drawing their Foot out of
the Snare, he puſheth them forward to maintain their ground,
and to juſtify their proceedings. This was the caſe of ſome of the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> when the Heathens had offered Sacrifice to an Idol,
part of the Sacrifice was reſerved, and either ſold at the <hi>Shambles,</hi>
or uſed in <hi>a Feaſt,</hi> to which the Heathens ſometimes invited their
<hi>Chriſtian Acquaintance</hi> or Relations. Thoſe that went, <hi>(knowing
that an Idol was nothing)</hi> eat what was ſet before them, <hi>without</hi>
any regard to the Idol, and <hi>making no queſtion for Conſcience ſake:</hi>
by their example, other <hi>that had not that knowledg,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 7.
<hi>were emboldned,</hi> not only to eat againſt their ſcruples and doubts
of Conſcience, (which is all that many Interpreters think to be
intended in that place) but alſo (as the words make probable)
with ſome <hi>poſitive regard</hi> to the Idol; ſo that by the examples of
thoſe that ſate in the Idols Temple, eating what was ſet before
them as <hi>common Meat,</hi> others <hi>miſinterpreting</hi> their Actions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to eat with <hi>a Conſcience of the Idol,</hi> as if the Idol had been
ſomething indeed, and deſerving a <hi>conſcientious regard.</hi> Not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to this was that Art of <hi>Julian,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Sozomen,</hi>
whereby he endeavoured to <hi>twiſt</hi> ſomething of <hi>Paganiſm</hi> with
Actions and things that were lawful or neceſſary:<note place="margin">Sozomeni <hi>Eccl. Hiſt.</hi> l. 5. c. 16.</note> He cauſed the
Images of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> to be placed by his <hi>own,</hi> ſo that the
reſpects that were payed to the Emperours <hi>Picture,</hi> ſeemed to
carry a <hi>concomitancy</hi> of reverence to thoſe <hi>Idols:</hi> He alſo (in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of the ſame policy) cauſed their Meats and Drinks to
be ſprinkled or mixed with the <hi>luſtral Water,</hi> that ſo every one
that uſed them, might be <hi>inured</hi> to give ſome regard to his Idols;
and that ſome, at leaſt, might be engaged to a <hi>juſtification</hi> of that
and ſuch other practices.</p>
                     <p>All theſe are but Inſtances of Satans ſilent inſinuation, by
which he ſecretly ſteals the Affections, and through theſe, taints
the Judgment. Next follows,</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Plot upon the Affections, which is an endeavour to
entangle them by the <hi>external garb</hi> of Errour. In this he works
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49412:137"/>
by two <hi>contrary extreams,</hi> that he may the better prevail with
Mens different diſpoſitions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He ſometimes cloaths a falſe Doctrine with the moſt
<hi>pompous, gorgeous, delightful</hi> Attire, that like <hi>Solomons</hi> Harlot it
may entice thoſe that are pleaſed with the higheſt gratifications
of the ſenſes, <hi>I have decked my Bed with Coverings of Tapeſtry, with
fine Linnen of</hi> Egypt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moſt Men that are given up to an
<hi>Animal life,</hi> cannot be pleaſed with any Religion but ſuch as may
moſt <hi>pleaſe the ſenſes;</hi> they ſo diſreliſh the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the Goſpel
(which is, notwithſtanding, its particular <hi>mark</hi> and <hi>honour,
2 Cor. 11. 3.)</hi> that they cannot perſwade themſelves they do
any thing in religious Worſhip, except they abound in <hi>coſtly
ceremonious obſervances.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Primus in orbe Deos timor fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit.</note> Thus do ſome interpret that <hi>fear</hi> of the
Heathens, which firſt put them upon <hi>Images</hi> and outward repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
of their Gods; they were affraid they ſhould not have
any Religion to their <hi>own ſatisfaction,</hi> except they proceeded in
ſuch a courſe as might make their ſenſes ſure that they were doing
ſomething: the Devil knowing well the force of <hi>external beauties</hi>
in Religion, prepared the way to Idolatry by it. They had their
<hi>coſtly Temples,</hi> ſome of them admirable for Antiquity and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
enriched with Gifts and Offerings, excellent for Matter
and Workmanſhip, adorned with Images, Lamps, Beds, and
Tables of Gold, beautified by Art, and natural pleaſantneſs of
Scituation; they had alſo their Groves in the moſt pleaſant and
delightful Places, as that of the <hi>Daphne</hi> beſides <hi>Antiochia,</hi> which
was invironed with tall Cypreſs Trees, ten Miles about, and
within adorned with the ſumptuous Temples of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi>'s
Sanctuary; in theſe places they had their Muſick and ſolemn
Feſtivals, which were ſometimes extraordinary, for coſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.
<hi>Antiochus</hi> at <hi>Daphne</hi> continued an incredible ſolemnity,
with a vaſt train and coſtly preparation for thirty days together;
and that nothing might be wanting, they had their Annual
Feaſts, Sacrifices, Rites, the Adornments of their Prieſts, their
white Garments, their Coats of divers Colours, their Miters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in
a word, nothing was lacking that might pleaſe the Eye or Ear.
And doubtleſs the Devil found this courſe very ſucceſsful to win
the Affections of Men to <hi>Gentiliſm.</hi> And if it were not for <hi>this</hi>
conſideration, it might be admired that the <hi>Jews</hi> (who were
inſtructed in the true Worſhip of God) ſhould, notwithſtanding,
be ſo <hi>prone</hi> to Idolatry, and ſo <hi>hardly</hi> drawn from it: but, ſurely
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49412:138"/>
their ſtrong inclinations that way proceeded from a natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
that Men have in a <hi>ſenſual</hi> Religion, which by a powerful
Witchcraft doth inchant them to an exceſs of love. The ſame
method the Devil takes in <hi>Popery,</hi> the chief inticement lies in its
glorious <hi>external appearance;</hi> all their religious places are dreſſed
up in the higheſt bravery, they are beautified with Images and
Pictures, with Lights and coſtly Adornments; they abound in
Rites, Ceremonies, Geſtures, and Obſervances, and all this is
but to dazle the Eyes, and to win a reverence in Men to their
Worſhip; and accordingly, they practiſe in theſe exteriour things
on purpoſe to raviſh Mens Affections; their Children are brought
up to a confirmed delight and reſolution for Popery, by pleaſing
them with Shews, Pictures, Repreſentations, Proceſſions, and
grateful Obſervances. If a Stranger of another Religion come
among them, then as their firſt eſſay, they ſhew them all their
Play-things, that their Affections may be tickled with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
pomp and ornament of their way, for they know by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that a <hi>glitering out-ſide,</hi> and <hi>a great deal ado</hi> of bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
is the All of moſt Mens Religion; if it have but <hi>Body</hi> enough,
they never enquire whether it have <hi>Spirit</hi> or Life within: a dead
<hi>Carcaſs in Robes,</hi> that may put them to the exerciſe of their <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,</hi>
and ceremonious Complements, doth make up a <hi>more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Religion for a carnal Man, than a <hi>living, ſpiritual</hi> Service, that
neceſſarily will put them upon <hi>inward</hi> care and watchfulneſs in
the <hi>conſtant</hi> exerciſe of holy <hi>Spiritual</hi> Graces, without affording
any conſiderable <hi>gratification</hi> to the Senſes: Hence is it truly more
difficult, (and yet inwardly more beautiful and glorious) to
<hi>pray in Faith and Humility,</hi> even in ſhort breathings after God,
than to ſay a <hi>thouſand Ave Maria's,</hi> or to perform a task of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Penance.</hi> But as thoſe that have no Children of their own,
delight themſelves in playing with a <hi>Monkey</hi> or <hi>Baboon,</hi> ſo thoſe
that know not how to worſhip God <hi>in Spirit and Truth,</hi> ſeek to
ſatisfie themſelves in the performance of <hi>external Geſture</hi> and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, On the other hand; he ſometimes is willing that an
Errour ſhould affect an <hi>exceſs of plainneſs</hi> and ſimplicity. In this
he takes advantage of thoſe expreſſions in Scripture, wherein the
Goſpel is commended for its <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> and the inventions of
Men under the pretences of <hi>Wiſdom, Humility,</hi> and <hi>neglecting of
the Body</hi> are condemned. Upon this ground, he runs Men upon
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49412:138"/>
ſuch an exceſs of dotage, that they never think the things of
God are rightly managed but when they are brought down to a
<hi>contemptible ſillineſs.</hi> By this means he arms conceited ignorant
Men with exceptions againſt <hi>Learning,</hi> and the neceſſary <hi>decencies</hi>
of languague in Preaching; and with them they are the <hi>only</hi>
Preachers, and moſt likely to be <hi>inſpired</hi> that uſe <hi>leaſt</hi> ſtudy and
preparation for their work. 'Tis indeed very true, that the affected
<hi>fooleries</hi> of a <hi>bombaſt</hi> Stile, or <hi>ſtartcht Diſcourſe,</hi> and needleſs <hi>citations</hi>
of Sentences for oſtentation, without any true advantage to the
<hi>matter</hi> in hand, are things very <hi>pedantick,</hi> and exceedingly unſuitable
to the <hi>gravity</hi> of the Work of the Miniſtry, and renders it very
ungrateful to a pious Mind: but this <hi>contrary folly</hi> makes the
ſolemn Ordinances of God ſo <hi>nauſeous</hi> and contemptible, that it
often makes way (by Satan's cunning improvement of the
Temptation) to an <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> rejection of all Worſhip. In the
mean time 'tis wonderful to obſerve, how ſome Perſons pleaſe
themſelves with this conceit, that their way of Worſhip is plain,
and that they ſpeak what <hi>immediately</hi> comes into their Mind;
and though it be <hi>Non-ſenſe</hi> or Contradictions (which ſufficiently
evidenceth that 'tis nothing of <hi>kin</hi> to the <hi>Spirits Inſpiration)</hi>
which they utter, yet 'tis argument enough to them, that their
opinions and ways are right, becauſe they proceed in a <hi>deſigned</hi>
neglect of all neceſſary order, and under pretence of the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the Goſpel, they reduce all they do to childiſh ſillineſs.
Neither is this all the miſchief which the Devil raiſeth out of
this conceit, for the contempt and diſuſe of the Sacraments,
may in great part be aſcribed to it. Thoſe erroneous ways of
Worſhip that are moſt noted for decrying thoſe Inſtitutions of
Chriſt, have this for their Plea, that the Worſhip which God is
beſt pleaſed with, is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and that all <hi>bodily</hi> ſervices and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
obſervations are things that God ſtands not upon, ſuch as
<hi>profit little,</hi> and were no further in uſe, but to <hi>recommend</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
ſpiritual communion with God; ſo that the more they
<hi>reject</hi> theſe things, they perſwade themſelves they have a more
<hi>true underſtanding</hi> of the deſign of God in Religion. Either of
theſe ways Satan makes uſe of for the befooling of Men into an
humour of pleaſing themſelves with Errour. But,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He hath of old endeavoured to cloud and enervate
the Doctrine of the Bible by <hi>traditionary Fables.</hi> We meet with
many paſſages to this purpoſe: ſometimes he ſets up <hi>unwritten</hi>
                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:49412:139"/>
Traditions, not only of <hi>equal</hi> authority to the written Word, but
as <hi>completions</hi> and perfections of it. This he practiſed among the
<hi>Jews</hi> with ſuch ſucceſs, that the <hi>Traditions of the Elders</hi> were of
greater force with them than the <hi>Commands</hi> of God, as Chriſt
himſelf noted of them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 13. Of theſe unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
(which they called <hi>the Law by the word of Mouth,</hi> feigned
by them to be given to <hi>Moſes</hi> when he was in the Mount, and
ſo delivered from hand to hand) the Apoſtles gave many warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and ſignified the hazards that Truth ſtood in by them,
through the cunning of Satan, as <hi>Col. 2. 8. Beware leſt any man
ſpoil you—through the Traditions of Men.</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 4. <hi>Neither
give heed to Fables, and endleſs Genealogies.</hi> Tit. 1. 14. <hi>Not giving
heed to Jewiſh Fables, and Commandments of Men.</hi>—2 Tim. 4. 4.
<hi>And they ſhall turn away their Ears from the Truth, and ſhall be turned
unto Fables.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> at this day give the ſame entertainment to this
device that the <hi>Jews</hi> did of old, they boaſt as high of their <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi>
and are every whit as <hi>fabulous</hi> and fooliſh in them as they
were. Satan in his attempts upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to confirm them
in their falſe Worſhip, though he kept up the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
yet he was neceſſitated to alter the <hi>ſcene</hi> a little, that he
might more handſomly accommodate it to their condition; and
therefore he ſet up amongſt them <hi>fabulous imitations</hi> of the Truths
and Ordinances of the Scripture, inſomuch that there is ſcarce
any grand Myſtery, or remarkable Hiſtory, or Ordinance men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Scripture, but we may find ſomething among the
Heathens in Tradition or Practice that doth allude to it. What
traditionary <hi>imitations</hi> had they of the <hi>Creation</hi> recorded in the
Book of <hi>Geneſis?</hi> That of <hi>Ovid</hi> concerning the <hi>Chaos</hi> and firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of things, is known to every School-Boy. The <hi>Phoenicians</hi>
in their Theology give an odd account of it,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Purchas Pilg.</hi> l. 1. c. 17.</note> from their <hi>Taautus,</hi>
to this purpoſe, <hi>That the firſt beginnings of all things were a dark
diſordered Chaos, and the ſpirit of the dark Air; hence proceeded Moth,
that is Mire, from thence iſſued the Seeds and Generation of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in Earth and Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. The wickedneſs of Men before
the Flood, (mentioned <hi>Gen. 6. 1, 2.)</hi> is fabulouſly related in an
ancient Book,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Scalagers</hi> notas in <hi>Euſeb. Chron.</hi> p. 244.</note> (falſly aſcribed to <hi>Enoch)</hi> wherein the <hi>Watchmen
or Angels are reported to take them Wives of the Daughters of Men,
and that from thence was the race of Giants.</hi> For the deſcription of
Paradiſe, the Heathens had the <hi>Poetical Fiction</hi> of the <hi>Elyzian
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49412:139"/>
Fields,</hi> as they had the Story of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark
and the Deluge. The Story of <hi>Lots Wife</hi> was abuſed by the
Fiction of <hi>Orpheus</hi> his Wife, ſuddenly ſnatched from him for look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back. The Hiſtory of <hi>Sampſon</hi> was turned into their Story
of <hi>Hercules</hi> and his ten labours. From the Sun ſtanding ſtill in
<hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time, came that Fiction of <hi>Jupiters</hi> doubling
the night, that he might enjoy <hi>Alemena.</hi> In ſome of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes
of ſacred Story, they go ſo near in name and circumſtances
that 'tis paſt doubt they imitated the true Hiſtory, which they
corrupted:<note place="margin">Lib. 2. <hi>mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alſo by</hi> Joſephus <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. fews.</hi> l 10. c. 1.</note> for inſtance, <hi>Herodotus</hi> relates, that <hi>Sethon</hi> King of

againſt Senacherib,</hi> which plainly relates to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Juda,</hi>
and the wonders that God did for him. So in imitation of

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs</hi> Letters to <hi>Joab</hi> for his own deſtruction, we have in <hi>Homer</hi>

<hi>Bellerophon,</hi> wherein his death was commanded; the near affinity
of the names <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Jobatas,</hi> ſhews with what Heifer the Devil
plowed. The Hiſtory of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s offering up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> is by <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiry</hi>
applied to <hi>Saturn,</hi> who ſaith, he was by the <hi>Phaenicians</hi>
called <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he had by <hi>Anobreth</hi> one only Son, called <hi>Jeud</hi> (an
evident alluſion (ſaith <hi>Godwin,</hi> Antiq. <hi>lib. 4. cap. 3.)</hi> to <hi>Gen.
22.</hi> 2. where <hi>Iſaac</hi> is in the Hebrew called <hi>Jechid,</hi> that is an only
begotten) him he offered up on an Altar purpoſely prepared;
here not only the <hi>matter,</hi> but the <hi>names</hi> do clearly ſhew, that
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Story is imitated in this. The like imitation I might
ſhew to have been among the Heathen, of <hi>doctrinal</hi> Truths, as
of the ſacred Myſtery of the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

Feaſts, which they laid at their Idols Feet, conſecrating them by
Singing and other Ceremonies, and then they called there <hi>the
Fleſh and Bones</hi> of their God <hi>Vitziliputzli,</hi> (alluding directly to
that of our Saviour, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> &amp;c. inſomuch that <hi>Acoſta</hi>
thought the Devil mocked their <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> by it;)<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Purchas</hi> l. 8. c. 13.</note> this
was diſtributed among all, and was eaten with a great deal of
reverence, fear, and devotion.</p>
                     <p>We may ſee by thoſe inſtances, that in theſe fabulous imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of Truth, the Devil hath induſtriouſly traded, and that
which he aimed at in this deſign may eaſily be conjectured to be,</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>deſpiting and diſcrediting</hi> of Truth; he renders it
(by this means) <hi>ſuſpitious</hi> of ſome Forgery, as if the Scripture
were no better than an uncertain Tradition, as if (at the beſt)
it were doubtful, whether Scripture or theſe traditionary Fables
had better authority.</p>
                     <p>2. He further intends the <hi>intanglement</hi> of the Affections to
Errour by this Device;<note place="margin">Ita Diabolus hoc egit ut di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in <hi>Judaea</hi> editum vileſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, fidem &amp; authoritatem amitteret, &amp; tanti operis gloria ad tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſſima idola rediret. <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholcer.</hi>
                        </note> for he doth, as it were, take the <hi>ſpoils</hi>
of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> to adorn his <hi>Dagon</hi> withal, and without doubt
the <hi>Heathens</hi> were very much <hi>hardned</hi> in <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> by theſe tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary
Stories; hence, one obſerves, the Devil imitated the
Hiſtory of the Miracle done in favour of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
might loſe their <hi>credit</hi> and authority, and that the <hi>glory</hi>
of ſuch a wonder might be transferred to their <hi>Idols;</hi> and the
conſequence of both theſe, is</p>
                     <p>3. To <hi>deprive</hi> the Truth of its <hi>convincing power</hi> upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of Men. The principles of Scripture <hi>convince</hi> by the
<hi>evidence</hi> of their Truth: If that Truth be <hi>queſtioned</hi> by the ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of another <hi>Competitor,</hi> it preſently loſeth its force, and the
commands thereof are diſregarded, upon a ſuppoſition of its <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Another of his ways to betray the underſtanding by the
Affections, is by putting Men upon <hi>an accommodation</hi> of Truth,
to a <hi>complyance</hi> with Parties differing from it. And this hath been
ſo much the more ſucceſsful, becauſe it hath begun, and been
carried on upon the moſt <hi>ſpecious</hi> pretences. The <hi>avoiding</hi> of
Offences; the <hi>ſmoothing</hi> of the way of Religion, for the gaining
of the contrary minded; the <hi>preſervation</hi> of Peace and Unity, are
Pleas very plauſible; and really upon the account of theſe things,
the Scripture (both by its Precepts and Examples) hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to us <hi>condeſcentions</hi> and Brotherly <hi>forbearances.</hi> The
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49412:140"/>
                        <hi>Jews</hi> (who were diſſatisfied at the firſt publication of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
from the Yoke of <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremonies, purchaſed for us by
Chriſt) were <hi>indulged</hi> in the uſe of Circumciſion, and obſervance
of the difference of Meats for a long time, till they might be the
better ſatisfied in the Truth. Theſe pretences the Devil makes
uſe of to undermine Truth. And pleaſing his Agents with
the honour of a <hi>pious deſign,</hi> (and it may be at firſt really
<hi>ſo intended</hi> by them) he prevails with them, not only for a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
condeſcention</hi> to Men of contrary practice, but to caſt the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Truth into ſuch a <hi>fixed Mould</hi> that they may carry a
more <hi>near reſemblance</hi> to thoſe Opinions which they do moſt <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi>
oppoſe. The <hi>appearance</hi> of ſanctity, peaceableneſs, prudence,
and ſucceſsfulneſs in ſuch an undertaking, doth exceedingly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the <hi>well-meaning</hi> deſigners, which Satan, in the mean time,
carries them beyond all bounds, and ſo dangerouſly fixeth an
<hi>unnatural repreſentation</hi> of Truth, that it loſeth its own ſplendor,
and ſettles at laſt upon <hi>unſafe</hi> notions. Thus by the <hi>continuance</hi>
of ſuch a <hi>complyance,</hi> Errour begins to <hi>recruit</hi> its Forces, and is as
likely to <hi>draw over</hi> Truth wholly to its ſide, (by the argument
of <hi>reſemblance,</hi> and the conſequences following thereupon) as
Truth is wholly to <hi>extirpate</hi> and conquer Errour; and if it do not
that, ſucceeding Ages (that minded not the firſt deſign) find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things ſo continued to them in deep <hi>reverence</hi> to their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
form their <hi>prudential condeſcentions</hi> into <hi>perverſe opinions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we follow the <hi>tract</hi> of Time from the firſt preaching of the
Goſpel, we may find Satan's <hi>footſteps</hi> all along. In the Apoſtles
times, when the believing <hi>Jews</hi> were tollerated <hi>neceſſarily</hi> (till
time and experience might fully convince them) in their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (which was certainly given of <hi>God,</hi>
and ſo might very eaſily occaſion an opinion of the continuance
of it, <hi>Act. 15. 1, 5.)</hi> though the Apoſtles did not at all <hi>accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date</hi>
the <hi>ſtanding</hi> precepts of the New Teſtament to carry a <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
reſemblance</hi> of that Opinion, neither did they <hi>ſtill</hi> countenance
that practice, but did <hi>ſeaſonably</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> declare againſt it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
Chriſtians <hi>to ſtand in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made
them free,</hi> Gal. 5. 1, 2. yet Satan was buſie to take <hi>advantage</hi> of
the preſent forbearances, which the Holy Ghoſt had directed
them unto; inſomuch that inſtead of <hi>convincing</hi> all the diſſenters
by that <hi>lenity,</hi> ſome diſſenters waxed <hi>bold</hi> to perſwade the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<hi>to another Goſpel:</hi> But after their days the Devil purſued
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49412:141"/>
this deſign with greater ſcope; for inſtance, in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time,
when the <hi>Gentiles</hi> flocked into the Church with <hi>dirty Feet,</hi> and
in their <hi>old Rags,</hi> they were tollerated in ſome <hi>old cuſtoms</hi> of
Gentiliſm, and upon a deſign to win them, they made bold to
<hi>bend</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Goſpel toward their <hi>former uſages:</hi> they
thought indeed it was beſt to wink at things, and not to bear
too hard upon them at firſt, but that tollerating a <hi>leſſer</hi> evil, they
might avoid a <hi>greater</hi> inconvenience; and withall they deemed
they had done great ſervice to the Church and Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
if they could any way divert the Heathen from Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
their <hi>Idols:</hi> And to effect this the eaſilier, they ſeemed to
cheriſh <hi>their</hi> cuſtoms and rites of Worſhip, as conſonant in the
<hi>general,</hi> to the Principles of Chriſtianity, only they excepted againſt
the <hi>Object</hi> of their Worſhip as unlawful, ſo that upon the matter
they did no more than change <hi>the name.</hi> The manifold incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
that followed this kind of dealing, they did not diſcover
at firſt; but beſides the <hi>infecting</hi> the ſimplicity of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
with the <hi>dirt</hi> and dregs of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> (which they might
eaſily have ſeen) Time hath ſince diſcovered, that here the
Devil ſecretly laid the chief foundations of <hi>Popery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whoſoever ſhall impartially compare the Rites, Cuſtoms,
Uſages and Garbs of <hi>Popery,</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> will, to his
admiration, find ſuch an exact <hi>agreement</hi> and conſonancy, that he
muſt neceſſarily conclude that either <hi>Paganiſm</hi> imitated <hi>Popery,</hi> or
<hi>Popery</hi> imitated <hi>Paganiſm;</hi> but the latter is true, and that theſe
corruptions in Religion by <hi>Popery</hi> came in by <hi>a deſignment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Chriſtianity to Heatheniſm,</hi> (though it may be upon <hi>pious</hi>
intentions at firſt) is no difficult thing to evince; for (beſides
that the Rites of Paganiſm were more <hi>ancient,</hi> and ſo could not be
borrowed from Popery which came <hi>long after)</hi> the Scripture did
foretel a great <hi>defection</hi> from Truth, which ſhould be in the <hi>laſt
days,</hi> and this <hi>under a profeſſion</hi> of Religion; and the things <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularized,</hi>
are ſuch, as ſhew that the defection ſhould carry an
<hi>imitation</hi> of Paganiſm; for no leſs ſeems to be ſignified by 1 <hi>Tim.

Their Doctrine of <hi>Daemons</hi> was this: they ſuppoſed <hi>two ſorts</hi> of

dwell in the <hi>Heavenly Lights,</hi> Sun, Moon, and Stars, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

that they might not be prophaned with the approach of earthly
things, and that <hi>immediate</hi> approaches to them were <hi>derogatory</hi> to
their Soveraignty. The inferiour order of Gods they imagined
were of a <hi>middle ſort,</hi> betwixt the <hi>ſupream</hi> Beings and Men, as
participating of <hi>both:</hi> theſe they called <hi>Mediators</hi> and Agents, and
ſuppoſed their buſineſs was to <hi>carry up Mens Prayers to God,</hi> and
to <hi>bring down Bleſſings</hi> from God upon Men;<note place="margin">De <hi>Civit. Dei.</hi> l. 8. c. 14, 18.</note> theſe were in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Did the Heathen <hi>pray</hi> to theſe <hi>Daemons</hi> for their aid? ſo do the

their <hi>Candlemas</hi> with Lights. Did the Heathen <hi>erect Images</hi> and

the Papiſts: the one had <hi>Proceſſions</hi> and <hi>Adorations,</hi> ſo have the

Proſecution, (and ſurely it pleaſed its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers not a little) the
Foundation of that Evil which Religion hath ſince groaned under, that
Men made bold with the tremendous Myſteries of Chriſtianity, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate

Certainly the Snare is neither unuſual, nor weak, where the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ſo ſerious. 'Tis a thing naturally pleaſing, to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter
of any new thing, or to make new <hi>Diſcoveries</hi> in Religion,
to raiſe new Hypotheſes, or to adventure in <hi>unbeaten</hi> Paths, for a
<hi>Reconcilement</hi> of Religion to any Notion, or Practice, famous for
its <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or pretence to <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Decency.</hi> Men hug them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
when they can make ſeveral things to hit right, and an exact
ſuiting of Parallels is inſtead of Demonſtration. By this fooliſh
delight the Devil makes Men bold to make Eſſays; and what
doth anſwer their humour, paſſeth currant for undoubted
Truth.</p>
                     <p>5. He doth ſometime blind the Underſtanding, by working up
the Affections to ſuch an <hi>earneſt Oppoſition</hi> to ſome Error, that in
a <hi>forward</hi> haſte they caſt the Mind upon a <hi>contrary Extreme:</hi> ſo that
through an haſty violent avoidance of one Error, they are caſt upon
a contrary, and (it may be) as dangerous as that they fly from.
And this the Devil doth with great eaſe, having the plauſible
pretence of <hi>Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> to Truth, wherein the Affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
highly ingaged, the Mind in a careleſs <hi>Confidence</hi> doth eaſily
<hi>overſhoot</hi> the Truth, (which commonly lies in the middle) and
thinks it doth well enough, if it gives the <hi>greateſt Contradiction</hi> to
the Error now to be abominated. Men in this Caſe, having
their eyes only fixed upon what they <hi>would avoid,</hi> conſider not ſo
much whither they are going, as <hi>from what</hi> they go. So that ſeeking
(as Men in a fright) to avoid the Pit that is <hi>before</hi> them, they run
backward into another <hi>behind</hi> them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="263" facs="tcp:49412:143"/>
This is ſuch a noted Stratagem of Satan, that all Men take
notice of it the general, though all Men do not improve the
Diſcovery for their own particular Caution. The <hi>wiſeſt</hi> of Men
are often ſo befooled by their violent reſiſtance of an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth,</hi> that
they readily overſhoot themſelves and miſs the Mark. The <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
in the heat of diſpute ſaid many things ſo inconveniently, that
thoſe who come after, do ſee and lament theſe <hi>haſty Overſights;</hi>
and have no other way to <hi>ſalve</hi> their Credit, but by giving <hi>this
Obſervation</hi> in excuſe for them. And it may be obſerved that
ſome Errors which have riſen from this Root <hi>at firſt,</hi> have ſo
ſtrongly fixed themſelves, that they have grown up to the great
annoyance of the Truth; while the contrary Errors that did oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
them are forgotten, and their memories are periſhed. I
ſhall but inſtance in one inſtead of many, and that ſhall be <hi>Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm;</hi>
how ſadly prevalent that hath been in its time, all Men
know that know any thing of Church Hiſtory; the Chriſtian
World once groaned under it. But that which gave the firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to <hi>Arrius</hi> to fix himſelf in that Error, was the Doctrine of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> who diſcourſing of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> in the <hi>Trinity</hi> too nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſeemed to juſtify the Error of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> who had taught (as
alſo <hi>Noetus</hi> before) that there was but <hi>one Perſon</hi> in the Trinity,
called by divers <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> according to
different occaſions; the Trinity (according to his Doctrine)
being not of <hi>Perſons,</hi> but of <hi>Names</hi> and Functions. While <hi>Arrius</hi>
was diſſatisfied with this account of the Trinity, he ran to a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Extreme;</hi> and that he might give the higheſt proof of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of <hi>Perſons,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Socr.</hi> Eccleſ. Hiſtor. lib. 1. cap. 3.</note> he affirmed that Jeſus Chriſt had a <hi>beginning,</hi> and
that there was a time when he was not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Socrates</hi> ſpeaks
of the Riſe of that Hereſy.</p>
                     <p>We might further follow the footſteps of this Device, and trace
it in moſt Opinions; where we might find the humour of running
to a contrary Extreme, hath ſtill either ſet up a contrary Error,
or at leaſt leavened the Truth with <hi>harſh</hi> and <hi>unjuſtifiable</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
and Explanations. The Diſputes betwixt <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Works,</hi> have been thus occaſioned and aggravated. Some ſpeak
ſo of <hi>Faith,</hi> as if they <hi>ſlighted Works;</hi> others ſo urge a <hi>neceſſity of
Works,</hi> as if they intended to make <hi>Faith uſeleſs.</hi> Some talk of
<hi>Grace</hi> to an utter <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>Morality;</hi> others on the contrary
magnify <hi>Morality</hi> to the <hi>annihilating</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi> Some in their
practice acquieſce in the <hi>outward Performance</hi> of Ordinances: if
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49412:144"/>
they pray or receive the Sacraments, (though never ſo formally)
they are at peace, ſuppoſing they have done all that is required;
others obſerving the Miſtake, and knowing that God looks more
to the performance of the Soul and Spirit, than to the Act of the
Body, upon a pretence of worſhipping God in Spirit, throw off
the obſervation of his Ordinances altogether. Neither is there
any thing that doth more generally and apparently undoe us in
the preſent Diſſentions, (as many have complained) than Mens
violent <hi>Over-doing,</hi> and running to contrary Extremes.</p>
                     <p>6. Satan makes uſe of <hi>Rewards,</hi> or <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> on the one
hand to <hi>bribe,</hi> or on the other to <hi>force</hi> the Affections, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtrongly poſſeſſed, eaſily prevail with the Underſtanding to
give Sentence accordingly. Men are ſoon perſwaded to take that
for Truth which they ſee will be <hi>advantageous</hi> to them. Some
Men indeed take up with a Profeſſion of Truth, which yet their
Hearts approve not; but the Advantages they have by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
do ſilence their diſſatisfactions; theſe are ſaid to uſe the
Profeſſion of Truth <hi>as a Cloak of Covetouſneſs, 2 Theſ.</hi> 2. 5. But
others go further, and are really brought to an <hi>Approbation</hi> of that
Doctrine or Way that makes moſt for their <hi>Profit,</hi> their Minds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
really corrupted by a ſelf-ſeeking Principle; they perſwade
themſelves, (where there is any Conteſt about Doctrines) that
that Doctrine is <hi>true</hi> which is <hi>gainful,</hi> and will accordingly
diſpute for it. Hence that Expreſſion in 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 5. ſuppoſing
that Gain is Godlineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this may be added, that the Affections are quickly ſenſible
of the <hi>Eaſe,</hi> and <hi>ſenſual Gratifications</hi> of any Doctrine, and theſe
are uſually thrown into the ſame Scale to make more weight.
Men have naturally a good liking to that Doctrine that promiſeth
fair for Eaſe, Liberty, Gain, and Honour; and this hath made
it an uſual piece of Satans buſineſs in all Ages to gild an Error
with outward Advantages, and to corrupt the Mind by ſecret
Promiſes of Advancement.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, he labours as much to prejudice Truth,
by repreſenting it as <hi>hazardous</hi> and <hi>troubleſom</hi> to the Profeſſors of
it. And this not only affrights ſome from an open Confeſſion of
the Truth they believe; but alſo by the help of the Affections
doth perſwade ſome to believe that to be an Error, which unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
brings Perſecution with it: By this Engine are the Minds
of Men turned about to think well or ill of a Doctrine preſented
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49412:144"/>
to them. This is ſo well known, that I ſhall forbear a further
Proſecution of this Head, and go to the next Courſe than Satan
takes to corrupt the Judgment by the Affections; Which he
doth,</p>
                     <p>7. By ſtirring up ſome <hi>particular Paſſions,</hi> which in Opinions
do uſually more influence the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> And here I ſhall
only inſiſt upon theſe two, <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Anger;</hi> with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
means that Satan hath to engage them in his Service.</p>
                     <p>That Pride and Anger are the two uſual <hi>Firebrands</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and Fountains of Error, all Ages have acknowledged
and bewailed. Theſe two <hi>Companions in Evil</hi> do ſo darken the
Mind, that the miſerable Captive, in whom they domineer, is
carryed blindfold he knows not whither, nor how. Pride uſually
begins, and Anger follows with all its forces to juſtify what Pride
hath undertaken. Hence the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4. rakes up all
the concomitant Filth of Error, as <hi>Envy, Strife, Railings, evil
Surmiſings,</hi> and <hi>perverſe Diſputings of Men,</hi> and lays them at the
Door of <hi>Pride; He is proud, knowing nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the ingaging of theſe two Thieves, that <hi>rob</hi> the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of its Light, Satan hath many <hi>Artifices</hi> in readineſs. Pride
(which is forward enough of it ſelf) is ſoon excited, by laying
before it an Opportunity of a ſeeming <hi>rare Diſcovery,</hi> or of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the <hi>Glory of Knowledge</hi> above the common Pitch, of being
<hi>ſeen</hi> and admired as more excellent than others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (for upon
ſuch unworthy Grounds have ſome dared to adventure upon
ſtrange Notions) yet there is nothing that doth more firmly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
it, than Contention or <hi>Diſpute:</hi> for though the proper end
of Diſputation be the <hi>ſifting out</hi> of Truth; yet ſuch is Mans Pride,
and Satans Advantage by it, that it ſeldom attains its true end in
<hi>thoſe that are ingaged.</hi> By-ſtanders, that keep their Minds calm,
and unbyaſſed, may receive more ſatisfaction than the Contenders
themſelves; and there needs no other evidence of this, than the
common Experience which Men have of our frequent Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
where we have Confutations, Anſwers and Replies, and
yet ſtill all Parties continue in their Opinions without Conviction.
So that they that would unfeignedly feels Truth, (in my Mind)
take not the beſt Courſe in their Purſuit, that preſently engage
themſelves in a <hi>publick Diſpute,</hi> for the uſual Heats that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
in a Contention alienate their Minds from a juſt <hi>Impartiality,</hi>
and the duſt they raiſe blinds their Eyes, that they diſcern not
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:49412:145"/>
truly. Let us look into this Artifice of engaging Pride by Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and by it the Judgment. Firſt we find, that when an
humor of contending is raiſed, <hi>certain</hi> Truths are neglected, as to
their improvement and Practice; For ſo much of the Strength of
the Soul is laid out upon <hi>diſputable Queſtions,</hi> that little is left for
more <hi>weighty matters.</hi> Secondly, In Diſputes Mens Credit is ſo
concerned, that 'tis a moſt difficult thing to preſerve a <hi>faithful</hi>
regard to Verity, eſpecially where they are managed with <hi>Affronts</hi>
and <hi>Contumelies.</hi> They that by <hi>calm handling</hi> might be induced to
acknowledge a Miſtake, will ſcarce <hi>come near</hi> that Point of Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
when they muſt be called <hi>Fool, Knave,</hi> or <hi>Aſs</hi> for their
labour. Hence ordinarily (though they profeſs otherwiſe) Men
ſeek rather Victory than Truth. Thirdly, in Diſputes Pride and
Paſſion are uſually heightned, and the <hi>ſtronger</hi> the Paſſions are, the
<hi>weaker</hi> is the Judgment. Eager Altercations bring a Confuſion,
both upon the matter of which they diſpute, and upon the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
that ſhould judge. Fourthly, in the heart of Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
when the Mind is inflamed, Men uſually behave themſelves
like thoſe in a <hi>Fray,</hi> where they ſnatch and throw any thing that
comes to hand, and never mind where it hits; they will affirm
or deny any thing that may ſeem any way to bring them off.
Fifthly, theſe Aſſertions being <hi>once affirmed,</hi> muſt be <hi>maintained,</hi>
and ſo Errors and Contentions increaſe without end. Diſputes fix
a Man in his Perſwaſion, and do as it were tye him to the Stake, ſo

Seventhly, A ſadder Miſchief often follows a diſputing Humor,
which is an hazard of the loſs of <hi>all Truth;</hi> Men diſpute ſo long till

                     </p>
                     <p>After the ſame manner doth the Devil <hi>engage Anger</hi> in all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
and Controverſies, for it keeps company with Pride,
wherever there is a Provocation. And beſides this, Anger ſtirring
up Injuries and Wrongs,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acont.</hi> Strat. Satanae, lib. 1. p. 23.</note> hath often engaged Men (as it were
<hi>in revenge)</hi> to change their Opinion, and to take up another Way
or Doctrine. Nay often that ſimple Mixture of Pride and Anger
which we call <hi>Emulation,</hi> hath privately tainted the Integrity of
Mind, and prepared it for the next fair opportunity of Error.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49412:145"/>
This is noted of <hi>Arrius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Theod.</hi> Eccleſ. Hiſt. l. 1. c. 2.</note> by <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that when <hi>Alexander</hi> was
choſen Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he envied him the preferency, and
from thence ſought occaſions of Contention, which after a
little while the Devil brought to his hand, as we have heard.</p>
                     <p>So great is the power of theſe two Paſſions over the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that we have cauſe to wonder at their ſucceſs: ſeldom
or never can if be ſhown that any <hi>Ring-leader</hi> in Errour was not
viſibly <hi>tainted</hi> with Pride, or not apparently <hi>ſowred</hi> with Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
and Emulation.</p>
                     <p>8. To theſe ways of blinding the Underſtanding by the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
I ſhall add but one more, which is this: Satan endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
mainly to <hi>adorn</hi> an Errour with <hi>Truths clothing;</hi> he takes
its Ornaments and Jewels to dreſs up a falſe Doctrine, that it
may look more lovely and dutiful; I mean, that he deſigns
(where Errours are capable of ſuch an imitation) to put them
into the <hi>way, method, garb</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> which Truth doth naturally
uſe: If Truth be adorned with <hi>Zeal, Order, Strictneſs,</hi> or have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
ways of <hi>managing</hi> it ſelf, Errour muſt ſtraight-way imitate
it in all theſe things; and though he that looks near, may eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that 'tis not the <hi>natural complexion</hi> of Errour, but an <hi>artificial
varniſh,</hi> and ſuch as doth no more become it than a Court-dreſs
doth become a courſe, clowniſh Country Perſon, (for you may at
firſt look uſually diſcover the <hi>Wolf</hi> under <hi>Sheeps clothing,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>garb of the Apoſtles of Chriſt</hi> you may ſee <hi>the Miniſters of
Satan)</hi> yet are the credulous uſually affected with theſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances;
if they find a profeſſed ſtrictneſs, a ſeeming ſeverity, an
imitation of the ways of Truth, or of the fruits thereof, they
commonly ſeek no further, but judg that to be Truth which
doth the things that Truth doth; and if Errour can handſomly
ſtand in competition with Truth, upon a pretence of being as
effectual in <hi>good works,</hi> and doing things of themſelves <hi>lovely,</hi>
and of <hi>good report,</hi> it doth much gain upon the good liking of thoſe
whoſe conſideration leads them not much further than fair ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances.
I ſhall only exemplify this by the Art and policy
which <hi>Julian</hi> uſed to ſet up <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and to ruine Chriſtianity,
(and thoſe who have obſerved the ways which he took to gain
his end, will readily acknowledg he was as well skill'd in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
Errour and ſuppreſſing Truth as any whoſoever, and
knew exactly to ſuit his deſigns to Mens inclinations) he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
that Chriſtian Religion had ſome particular things in its
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49412:146"/>
practice and way, which made it's face to ſhine, as that it had
Perſons ſolemnly <hi>ſet apart by Ordination</hi> for teaching the Myſteries
of the Goſpel, and for managing the publick Worſhip of God;
that theſe Perſons were to be <hi>grave</hi> in their carriage, and <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary</hi>
in a ſtrict holy converſation; that the Conſtitutions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
appointed certain neceſſary and effectual ways of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi>
for Puniſhment, and reſtoring of Offenders, and bringing them
to Repentance; that it took care of the comfortable maintenance
of thoſe that had given up themſelves to the Miniſtry of the Word
and Prayer; that it alſo enjoyned a relief of the Poor and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Taking notice (I ſay) of theſe Excellencies in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and how lovely they were in the eyes of their enemies;
He appointed the <hi>like Conſtitutions</hi> for Paganiſm, and ordained
that the <hi>Idol Temples</hi> ſhould be ſuited in conveniency and <hi>comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
to Chriſtian Churches; That there ſhould be <hi>Seats</hi> and <hi>Desks</hi>

and <hi>Monaſteries</hi> ſhould be erected for them, and for the <hi>relief</hi> of
the Poor and Strangers; he commanded <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Penances</hi>
for the chaſtiſement of Offenders; he required that their Prieſts
ſhould ſeriouſly <hi>give up</hi> themſelves to the Worſhip of God, as alſo
their <hi>Families;</hi> that they ſhould not frequent <hi>Shews</hi> and <hi>Taverns,</hi>
nor practiſe any <hi>infamous</hi> Trade and Art.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sozom.</hi> Eccl. Hiſt. l. 5. c. 15.</note> Thus <hi>Sozomen</hi> reports
him, and gives us a Copy of his Letter to <hi>Arſacius</hi> high Prieſt of
<hi>Galatia</hi> to this purpoſe; and all this he did to bring <hi>Gentiliſm</hi>
into credit with the Vulgar, whom he had obſerved to be affected
to Chriſtianity for its Order, Strictneſs and Government.</p>
                     <p>Yet is not this the only inſtance that may be given in this
kind: for obſerve but any Errour that by <hi>Schiſm</hi> ſets up for it ſelf
in a <hi>diſtinct party,</hi> and you ſhall ſee that though it departs from
the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Church, and from its <hi>Communion,</hi> yet ſtill (as
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did with the <hi>Egyptians)</hi> it carries away with it
theſe Jewels of the Church, and keeps to ſome conſiderable part
of the Churches way, (though <hi>modified</hi> according to its own
bent) that it might have a luſtre with it, to make it taking with
others.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>eight</hi> particulars are the moſt remarkable ways of Satan,
whereby the Affections are gained to a good liking of Errour,
and by them the judgment <hi>ſecondarily</hi> corrupted to call it Truth.</p>

<hi>Sin,</hi> by which he withdraws Men from <hi>Duty</hi> and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
by which he corrupts the Mind through <hi>Errour;</hi> it only
now remains that ſomething be ſpoken of his attempts againſt
the <hi>Peace</hi> and Comfort of the Children of God.</p>
                     <p>That 'tis alſo one of Satans chief deſigns to cheat us of our
Spiritual Peace, may be fully evinced by a conſideration of <hi>his
Malice, the great concern</hi> of inward Comfort to us, and the <hi>many
Advantages</hi> which he hath againſt us by the diſquiet of our
Minds.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, whoſoever ſhall ſeriouſly conſider the Devil's <hi>implacable
Malice,</hi> will eaſily believe, that he ſo <hi>envies</hi> our Happineſs that
he will induſtriouſly riſe up againſt all <hi>our Comforts.</hi> 'Tis his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
fret and indignation that Man hath any intereſt in that
Happineſs from which he irrecoverably fell, and that the Spirit
of God ſhould produce in the hearts of his People any ſpiritual
joy or ſatisfaction in the belief and expectation of that Felicity,
and therefore muſt it be expected that his Malice (heightned by
the torment of his own guilt, which (as ſome think) are thoſe
<hi>Chains of darkneſs</hi> in which he is reſerved at preſent, <hi>to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the great day)</hi> will not, cannot leave this part of our
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49412:147"/>
Happineſs unattempted. He endeavours to ſupplant us of our Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
of our Bleſſing, of our Salvation, and the comfortable hopes
thereof. From his common imployment in this matter, the Scripture
hath given him <hi>names,</hi> importing an oppoſition to Chriſt and his
Spirit, in the ways they take for our Comfort and Satisfaction.

where the Apoſtle expreſſeth his fear, leſt the excommunicated
Perſon ſhould <hi>be ſwallowed up of too much ſorrow;</hi> but the caution
being not expreſsly bound up to any one of theſe, ſeems to point
at them all, and to tell us that Satan drives on many deſigns at
once, and that in this Mans caſe Satan would endeavour to put
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> upon a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> rigour, or to <hi>rend</hi> the Church
by a diviſion about him, and to <hi>oppreſs the Penitent</hi> by bereaving
him of his due comfort; ſo that it appears ſtill, that it is one of
his deſigns to hinder the Comfort, and moleſt the Hearts of God's
Children.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Of <hi>ſuch concern</hi> is <hi>inward</hi> ſpiritual Peace to us, that 'tis
but an eaſie conjecture to conclude from thence, that ſo great an
Adverſary will make it his deſign to rob us of ſuch a Jewel: For,</p>
                     <p>1. Spiritual Comfort is the <hi>ſweet Fruit</hi> of Holineſs, by which
God <hi>adorns</hi> and beautifies the ways of Religious Service, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:49412:147"/>
them amiable and pleaſant to the Undertakers. <hi>Her ways
are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace,</hi> Prov. 3. 17.
and this is the preſent <hi>reſt and refreſhment</hi> of God's faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
under all their <hi>toil,</hi> that when they have <hi>tribulation from the
World,</hi> yet they have <hi>peace in him,</hi> Joh. 16. 33. and that being
<hi>juſtified by Faith, they have peace with God,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8. and this they may the more
confidently expect, becauſe <hi>the fruits of the Spirit are Love, Joy,
Peace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
                     <p>2. Spiritual Comfort is not only our ſatisfaction, but our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Strength</hi> and Activity, for all holy Services doth depend
upon it. By this doth God ſtrengthen our Heart, and gird up
our Loyns <hi>to run the ways of his Commandments;</hi> it doth alſo
ſtrengthen the ſoul to undergo <hi>Afflictions,</hi> to glory in Tribulations,

which are intended by that expreſſion, <hi>Neh. 8. 10. The joy of the

that both for <hi>ſervice</hi> and <hi>ſuffering;</hi> the reaſon whereof the Apoſtle
doth hint to us, <hi>Phil. 4. 7. The peace of God which paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
ſhall keep your Hearts and Minds;</hi> that is, Peace doth ſo
guard us as with <hi>a Gariſon,</hi>

                           </gap>
                        </note> (for ſo much the word imports) that
our Affections <hi>(our Hearts)</hi> being <hi>entertained</hi> with <hi>divine ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions,</hi>
are not eaſily <hi>enticed</hi> by baſer proffers of <hi>worldly delights,</hi>

an object,</hi> are not ſo eaſily <hi>perverted</hi> to a treacherous recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of vanities.</p>
                     <p>3. Joy and Peace are propounded to our careful endeavours,
for Attainment and Preſervation, as a neceſſary <hi>duty</hi> of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to us. Rejoycings are not only <hi>recommended</hi> as <hi>ſeemly
for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright,</hi> but <hi>injoined</hi> as <hi>Service,</hi> and that in the <hi>conſtant</hi>
practice, <hi>Rejoyce evermore, In every thing give thanks,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 16, 18.
<hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alway; and again I ſay, rejoyce,</hi> Phil. 4. 4. In
the Old Teſtament God commanded the obſervation of ſeveral
Feaſts to the <hi>Jews,</hi> theſe though they had their ſeveral reſpective
grounds from God's appointment, yet the general deſign of all
ſeems to have been this, <hi>that they might rejoyce before the Lord their
God,</hi> Lev. 23. 40. as if God did thereby tell them that it was the
<hi>comely complexion</hi> of Religion, and that which was very <hi>acceptable</hi>
                        <pb n="272" facs="tcp:49412:148"/>
to himſelf, that his Children might always ſerve him in <hi>chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Heart,</hi> ſeeing ſuch have <hi>more cauſe</hi> to rejoyce than all the
World beſides. They are then much miſtaken, that think <hi>moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Eyes</hi> and <hi>ſad Hearts</hi> be the greteſt <hi>Ornaments</hi> of Religion,
or that none are <hi>ſerious</hi> in the Profeſſion of it, that have a <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Countenance and a <hi>rejoycing</hi> frame of Spirit. 'Tis true, there
is a Joy that is <hi>deviliſh,</hi> and in Mirth which is <hi>madneſs,</hi> to which
Chriſt hath denounced <hi>a Wo, Wo be to them that laugh now, for
they ſhall mourn and weep;</hi> but this is a Joy of another nature, a
<hi>carnal</hi> delight in <hi>Vanity and Sin,</hi> by which Men <hi>fatten</hi> their hearts
to ruine; and whatſoever is ſaid againſt this, can be no prejudice
to Spiritual, holy Joy in <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Ways.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Spiritual Comfort is alſo a <hi>badg</hi> of our Heavenly Father's
kindneſs. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> (the Son of his Fathers affections) had a
ſpecial teſtimony thereof in his party-coloured Coat; ſo have
Gods Favourites a peculiar token of his good Will to them, when
he gives them <hi>the Garments of Praiſe for the Spirit of Heavineſs;</hi> if
Spiritual Comfort be ſo advantagious to us, it will be no wonder
to ſee Satan ſo much rage againſt it; it would be a ſatisfaction
to him to tear theſe <hi>Robes</hi> off us, to impede ſo needful a <hi>Duty,</hi>
to rob us of ſo much <hi>Strength,</hi> and to bereave us of the ſweet
<hi>fruits</hi> of our Labours.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It further appears that Satan's deſign is againſt the
Comforts of God's Children, by the many <hi>advantages</hi> he hath
againſt them, from the trouble and diſquiet of their Hearts: I
ſhall reckon up the chief of them; As,</p>
                     <p>1. From the Trouble of the Spirit, he raiſeth <hi>confuſions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions</hi>
of Mind: For, 1. 'Tis as natural to Trouble, to raiſe
up a ſwarm of <hi>muddy Thoughts,</hi> as to <hi>a troubled Sea to caſt up Mire
and Dirt:</hi> and hence is that compariſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 20. a thouſand
fearful Surmiſes, evil Cogitations, Reſolves, and Counſels, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
offer themſelves. This diſorder of Thoughts Chriſt
took notice of in his Diſciples when they were in danger, <hi>Why
do thoughts ariſe in your hearts?</hi> Luk. 24. 38. And <hi>David</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it as matter of great anxiety, which called for ſpeedy help,
<hi>Pſal. 94. 19. In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
delight my ſoul.</hi> Sometimes one fear is ſuggeſted, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
another; now this doubt perplexeth, then another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is begot by the former; they think to take this courſe,
then by and by they are off that, and reſolve upon another, and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:49412:148"/>
as quickly change again to a third, and ſo onward, one Thought
ſucceeding another, as Vapours from a boyling Pot. 2. Such
Thoughts are <hi>vexatious</hi> and diſtracting, the very Thoughts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(being the poyſonous <hi>ſteams</hi> of their running Sores) are
ſadly afflictive, and not unfitly called <hi>Cogitationes oneroſae,</hi> burdenſom
Thoughts. But as they wrap up a Man in Clouds and Darkneſs, as
they puzzle him in his Reſolves, <hi>non-plus</hi> him in his Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
diſtract him in his Counſels, diſturb and hinder him in his
Endeavours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo do they bring the Mind into a labyrinth of
confuſion. What advantage the Devil hath againſt a Child of
God when his heart is thus divided and broken into Shivers,
'tis eaſie to imagine. And <hi>David</hi> ſeems to be very ſenſible of it,
when he put up that requeſt, <hi>Pſal. 86. 11. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite my heart to fear
thy Name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. By diſquiet of Heart the Devil <hi>unfits</hi> Men <hi>for Duty</hi> or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Fitneſs for Duty lies in the <hi>orderly temper</hi> of <hi>Body</hi> and
<hi>Mind,</hi> making a Man <hi>willing</hi> to undertake, and <hi>able</hi> to finiſh his
work with <hi>comfortable</hi> ſatisfaction; if either the Body or Mind
be diſtempered, a Man is unfit for ſuch an undertaking, both
muſt be in a ſuitable frame, (like a <hi>well-tun'd Inſtrument)</hi> elſe
there will be no melody: Hence, when <hi>David</hi> prepared himſelf
for Praiſes and Worſhip, he tells us, his <hi>Heart was ready</hi> and <hi>fixed,</hi>
and then <hi>his Tongue</hi> was <hi>ready</hi> alſo,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 1, 2, 108. 1, 2.</note> ſo was his Hand with Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
and Harp, all theſe were <hi>awakened</hi> into a ſuitable poſture.
That a Man is or hath been in a fit order for Service, may be
concluded from, 1. His <hi>Alacrity</hi> to undertake a Duty. 2. His
<hi>Activity</hi> in the proſecution. 3. His <hi>Satisfaction</hi> afterward, right
<hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> in theſe things being ſtill <hi>preſuppoſed.</hi> This
being laid as a foundation, we ſhall eaſily perceive how the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of the Spirit do unfit us for Duty: For,</p>
                     <p>1. Theſe do take away all <hi>Alacrity</hi> and forwardneſs of the
Mind, partly by <hi>diverting</hi> it from Duty. Sorrows when they
prevail, do ſo fix the Mind upon the preſent Trouble, that it
can think of nothing but its Burthen, they <hi>confine</hi> the Thoughts
to the <hi>pain</hi> and ſmart, and make a Man <hi>forget</hi> all other things;
as <hi>David</hi> in his trouble <hi>forget to eat his Bread;</hi> and ſick Perſons
willingly diſcourſe only of their Diſeaſes, partly by <hi>indiſpoſing</hi>
for action. <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> are <hi>active</hi> Principles, but <hi>Sorrow</hi> is <hi>ſullen</hi>
and ſluggiſh. As the Mind (in trouble) is wholly imployed in
a <hi>contemplation</hi> of its <hi>Miſery,</hi> rather than in <hi>finding out a way</hi> to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:49412:149"/>
avoid it, ſo if it be at leiſure at any time to entertain thoughts of
uſing means for recovery, yet 'tis ſo tired out with its Burden, ſo
diſheartned by its own Fears, ſo diſcouraged with Oppoſition
and Diſappointment, that it hath no <hi>liſt</hi> to undertake any thing;
by this means the Devil brings the ſoul into a ſpiritual <hi>Catoche,</hi>
ſo <hi>congealing</hi> the Spirits, that it is made ſtiff and deprived of
motion.</p>
                     <p>2. Diſquiets of Heart unfit us for Duty, by hindering our
<hi>activity</hi> in proſecution of Duty. The <hi>whole Heart,</hi> Soul, and
Strength ſhould be <hi>engaged</hi> in all religious Services, but theſe
Troubles are as Clogs and Weights to hinder motion. Joy is the
<hi>dilatation</hi> of the Soul, and widens it for any thing which it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes;
but Grief <hi>contracts</hi> the Heart, and narrows all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties:
hence doth <hi>David</hi> beg an <hi>enlarged heart,</hi> as the principle
of Activity, <hi>Pſal. 119. 32. I will run the way of thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
when thou ſhalt enlarge my Heart:</hi> for what can elſe be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
when the Mind is ſo diſtracted with Fear and Sorrow,
but that it ſhould be uneven, tottering, weak, and confuſed?
ſo that if it do ſet it ſelf to any thing, it acts <hi>troubleſomly,</hi> drives
on heavily, and doth <hi>very little</hi> with a <hi>great deal ado;</hi> and yet
were the unfitneſs the leſs, if that <hi>little</hi> which it can do, were
<hi>well</hi> done, but the Mind is ſo <hi>interrupted</hi> in its endeavours, that
ſometimes in Prayer the Man begins, and then is preſently at a
ſtand, and dare not proceed, his words are <hi>ſwallowed up, he is ſo
troubled that he cannot ſpeak,</hi> Pſal. 77. 4. Sometimes the Mind is
kept ſo imployed and fixed on Trouble that it cannot attend in
Hearing or Praying, but preſently the Thoughts are called off,
and become wandring.</p>
                     <p>3. Troubles hinder our <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> in Duty, and by that means
unfit us to <hi>preſent</hi> Duties, and indiſpoſe us to <hi>future</hi> Services of
of that kind. Our ſatisfaction in Duty ariſeth, 1. Sometimes
from <hi>its own luſtre</hi> and ſweetneſs, the conviction we have of its
<hi>pleaſantneſs</hi> and the ſpiritual advantages to be had thereby; theſe
render it alluring and <hi>attractive,</hi> and by ſuch conſiderations are
we invited to their performance, as <hi>Iſa. 2. 3. Come ye let us go
up to the Mountain of the Lord,—and he will teach us of his ways,
and we will walk in his paths.</hi> Hoſ. 6. 1. <hi>Come, and let us return
unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us: he hath ſmitten,
and he will bind us up;</hi> but trouble of Spirit draws a black Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
over the excellencies of Duty, and preſents us with frightful
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:49412:149"/>
thoughts about it, ſo that we judg of it according to our fears,
and make it frightful to our ſelves, as if it would be to no purpoſe,
rather a miſchief than an advantage. 2. Sometime our ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ariſeth from ſome <hi>ſpecial token of Favour</hi> which our indulgent
Father lets fall upon us, while we are in his work. As when he
gives us more than ordinary <hi>aſſiſtance,</hi> or puts <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Hearts. And this he often doth to make us come again,
and to engage <hi>afreſh</hi> in the ſame, or other ſervices, as having <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
and ſeen that the Lord is gracious,</hi> and that there is a bleſſedneſs
in waiting for him. As in our Bodies he ſo orders it, that the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
juices</hi> become a <hi>ſucceſſive Ferment</hi> to thoſe that ſucceed from
our daily Meat and Drink: So from Duties performed, doth he
beget and continue Spiritual <hi>Appetite</hi> to <hi>new</hi> undertakings. But
O how ſadly is all this hindered by the diſquiet of the Heart?
The Graces, of Faith and Love, are uſually obſtructed, if not in
their <hi>Exerciſe</hi> yet in their delightful <hi>Fruits,</hi> and if God offer a
kindneſs, inward ſorrow hinders the <hi>perception:</hi> As when <hi>Moſes</hi>
told the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of their deliverance, <hi>they hearkned not for hard bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi>
If a meſſage of Peace preſent it ſelf in a Promiſe, or ſome
conſideration of Gods merciful diſpoſition, yet uſually this is not
credited. <hi>Job</hi> confeſſeth ſo much of himſelf, Job 19. 16. <hi>If I
had called and he had anſwered me, yet would I not believe that he had
hearkened unto my Voice. David</hi> alſo doth the like, Pſal. 77. 2, 3.
<hi>My Soul refuſeth to be comforted: I remember God, and was troubled.</hi>
Matter of greateſt comfort is often ſo far from giving eaſe, that it
augments the trouble. However the Heart is ſo hurried with its
fears, and diſcompoſed with grief, that it cannot hearken to nor
conſider, nor believe any kind offer made to it.</p>
                     <p>By all theſe ways doth the Devil, through the diſquiet of Mind,
unfit the Lord's People for Duty; and what a ſad advantage this
is againſt us cannot eaſily be told. By this means he may <hi>widen</hi>
the diſtance betwixt God and us, keep our Wounds <hi>open,</hi> make us
a <hi>reproach</hi> to Religion: And what not? But</p>
                     <p>3. By theſe diſquiets he puſheth us on to <hi>reject all duties,</hi> for
when he hath tyred us out by weariſom endeavours, under ſo
great indiſpoſitions and unfitneſs, he hath a fair advantage to tempt
us to lay all aſide. Our preſent poſture doth furniſh him with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
he forgeth his <hi>Javelings</hi> upon our <hi>Anvil,</hi> and they are
commonly theſe <hi>three:</hi> 1. That duties are <hi>difficult.</hi> And this is
eaſily proved from our own experience, while we are broken or
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:49412:150"/>
bowed down with ſorrows: we make many attempts for duty,
and are oft beat off with loſs: our greateſt <hi>toil</hi> helps us but to very
<hi>inconſiderable</hi> performances, hence he infers, <hi>'Tis fooliſhneſs to attempt
that which is above our ſtrength, better ſit ſtill then toil for nothing.</hi>
2. That they are <hi>unfruitful,</hi> and this is our own complaint, for
troubled Spirits have commonly <hi>great expectations</hi> from duties <hi>at
firſt,</hi> and they run to them (as the impotent and ſick people, to
the Pool of <hi>Betheſda)</hi> with thoughts of <hi>immediate</hi> eaſe as ſoon as
they ſhall ſtep into them; but when they have tryed, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a while, ſiretching themſelves upon duty (as <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Servant
laid the Staff upon the Face of the <hi>Shunamites</hi> Son) and yet there
is <hi>no voice</hi> nor hearing, no anſwer from God, no peace, then are
they preſently diſatisfied, reflecting on the Promiſes of God, and
the Counſels of good Men, with this, <hi>Where is all the pleaſantneſs
you ſpeak of? what advantage is it that we have thus run, and laboured,
when we have got nothing?</hi> and then 'tis eaſy for the Devil to add,
<hi>And why do you wait on the Lord any longer?</hi> 3. His laſt and moſt
dangerous argument is, that they are <hi>ſinful.</hi> Unfitneſs for Duty
produceth many diſtractions, much deadneſs, wandering thoughts,
great interruptions, and pittiful performances. Hence the troubled
Soul comes off from duty, <hi>wounded</hi> and <hi>halting,</hi> more diſtreſſed
when he hath done, than when he began: upon theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that all his ſervice was <hi>ſin, a mocking of God, a taking his name
in vain,</hi> nay a very <hi>blaſphemous affront</hi> to a divine Majeſty. Upon
this the Devil ſtarts the queſtion to his Heart, <hi>whether it be not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to forbear all Duty, and to do nothing?</hi> Thus doth Satan improve
the trouble of the mind, and often with the deſigned ſucceſs. For
a dejected Spirit doth not only afford the <hi>materials</hi> of theſe Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
which the Devil frames againſt it, but is much prepared to
<hi>receive</hi> them into its own Bowels. The <hi>grounds</hi> of theſe Arguments
it <hi>grants</hi> and the <hi>inferences</hi> are commonly <hi>conſented</hi> to, ſo that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
duty is neglected, either, 1. Through <hi>ſottiſhneſs</hi> of Heart,
or 2. Through <hi>frightful</hi> fears: Or 3. Through <hi>deſperateneſs:</hi>
bringing a Man to the very precipice of that <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>I have cleanſed my hands in vain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Satan makes uſe of the troubles of Gods Children as a <hi>ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block
to others.</hi> 'Tis no ſmall advantage to him, that he hath
hereby an occaſion to render the ways of God <hi>unlovely</hi> to thoſe
that are beginning to look Heaven-ward, he ſets before them, the
Sighs, Groans, Complaints, and reſtleſs Out-cries of the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:49412:150"/>
in Spirit, to ſcare them off from all ſeriouſneſs in Religion,
and whiſpers this to them; <hi>Will you chuſe a Life of Bitterneſs and
Sorrow? can you eat Aſhes for Bread, and mingle your Drink with
Tears? will you exchange the comforts and contents of Life, for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
Heart, and a dejected countenance? how like you to go Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the day, and at night to be ſcared with Dreams and terrified
with Viſions? will you chuſe a Life that is worſe than Death? and a
condition which will make you a terrour to your ſelves, and a burthen to
others? can you be in love with an heart loaden with grief, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
fears almoſt to diſtraction? while you ſee others in the mean time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
themſelves in a contented peace?</hi> Thus he follows young begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with his ſuggeſtions, making them believe that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſerious in Religion, but at laſt they will be brought to this,
and that 'tis a very dangerous thing to be religious overmuch, and
the high way to diſpair: So that if they muſt have a Religion, he
readily directs them to uſe no more of it, than may conſiſt with
the pleaſures of Sin and the World, and to make an eaſy buſineſs
of it, not to let Sin lye over-near their Heart, leſt it diſquiet them,
nor over-much to concern themſelves with Study, Reading, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or hearing of threatning awakening Sermons, leſt it make them
<hi>Mad,</hi> nor to affect the ſublimities of Communion with God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
of Faith and Divine Love, leſt it <hi>diſcompoſe</hi> them, and daſh
their worldly Jollities <hi>out of Countenance.</hi> A Counſel that is readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough embraced by thoſe that are almoſt perſwaded to be
Chriſtians; and the more to confirm them in it, he ſticks not
ſometime to aſperſe the poor troubled Soul with <hi>Diſſimulation</hi>
(where that accuſation is proper, for the Devil cares not how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
he be to himſelf, ſo that he may but gain his end) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
all his ſeriouſneſs to be nothing but <hi>whining Hypocriſy.</hi>
So that whether they judg theſe troubles to be real or feigned, his
concluſion is the ſame, and he perſwades Men thereby to hold off
from all religious ſtrictneſs, holy diligence, and careful watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>5. A further uſe which the Devil makes of theſe troubles of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
is to <hi>prepare</hi> the Hearts of Men thereby, to give entertainment
to his <hi>venomous impreſſions.</hi> Diſtreſs of Heart uſually opens the
Door to Satan, and lays a Man naked, without Armour or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
as a fair Mark for all his poyſoned Arrows, and 'tis a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to one but ſome of them do hit. I ſhall chuſe out ſome of
the moſt remarkable, and they are theſe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="278" facs="tcp:49412:151"/>
1. After long <hi>acquaintance</hi> with grief he labours to <hi>fix</hi> them in it.<note place="margin">Eſt quaedam etiam delendi voluptas.</note>
In ſome caſes cuſtome doth <hi>alleviate</hi> higher griefs, and Men take
an <hi>odd kind of delight in them,</hi> 'tis ſome pleaſure to complain, and
Men ſettle themſelves in ſuch a courſe, their Finger is ever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Soar, and they go about telling their Sorrows to all they
converſe with, though to ſome this is a neceſſity, (for real Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
if they be not <hi>too great</hi> for vent, will conſtrain them to ſpeak,)
yet in ſome that have been formerly acquainted with grief, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates
at laſt into a <hi>formality</hi> of complaining; and becauſe
they formerly had cauſe ſo to do, they think they muſt always do ſo.
But beſides this, Satan doth endeavour to <hi>chain</hi> Men to their
mourning upon <hi>two</hi> higher Accounts,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Collius Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial</hi> Part 2. p. 154.</note> 1. By a <hi>deluſive contentment</hi>
in ſorrow, as if our tears <hi>paid</hi> ſome part of <hi>our debt</hi> to God, and
made <hi>amends</hi> for the injuries done to him. 2. By an <hi>obſtinate ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenneſs</hi>
and deſperate reſolvedneſs, they <hi>harden themſelves in ſorrow,</hi>
and ſay as <hi>Job 7. 11. I will not refrain my Mouth, I will ſpeak in the
anguiſh of my Spirit, I will complain in the bitterneſs of my Soul. Am
I a Sea, or a Whale, that thou ſetteſt a Watch over me?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Another impreſſion that Mens Hearts are apt to take, is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs,</hi>
for the favours <hi>formerly</hi> beſtowed upon them; their
<hi>preſent</hi> troubles blot out the memory of <hi>old</hi> kindneſſes; they
conclude they have nothing at all, becauſe they have not peace;
though God heretofore hath ſent down from on high, and taken
them out of the great Waters, or out of the Mire and Clay where
they were ready to ſink; though he hath ſent them many tokens
of Love, conferred on them many Bleſſings: yet all theſe are no
more to them, ſo long as their ſorrows continue, than <hi>Haman's</hi>
Wealth and Honour was to him, ſo long as <hi>Mordecai</hi> the Jew ſate
at the Kings Gate. Thus the Devil oft prevails with God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to deal with God, as ſome unthankful Perſons deal with
their Benefactors; who if they be not humour'd in every requeſt,
deny the reality of their Love, and diſpiſe with great ingratitude
all that was done for them before.</p>
                     <p>3. By inward griefs, the Heart of the afflicted are prepared to
entertain the <hi>worſt interpretation</hi> that the Devil can put upon the
<hi>Providences</hi> of God. The various <hi>Inſtances</hi> of Scripture, and the
gracious <hi>Promiſes</hi> made to thoſe that <hi>walk in Darkneſs and ſee no
Light,</hi> do abundantly forewarn Men from making <hi>bad</hi> concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God's dealings, and do tell us that God in deſign, for our
<hi>tryal,</hi> and for our <hi>profit</hi> doth often hide his Face <hi>for a moment,</hi> when
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:49412:151"/>
yet his purpoſe is to <hi>bind us up with everlaſting compaſſions.</hi> Now
the Devil labours to improve the ſorrows of the Mind to give a
quite contrary conſtruction: if they are afflicted, inſtead of ſaying,
<hi>Sorrow may endure for a Night, but Joy will come in the Morning,</hi> or
that <hi>for a little while God hath hidden himſelf,</hi> he puts them to ſay,
<hi>this Darkneſs ſhall never paſs away.</hi> If the grief be little, he drives
them on to a fearful expectation of worſe; as he did with <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,
Eſa. 38. 13. I reckoned till Morning, that as a Lyon, ſo will be
break all my Bones, from Day even to Night wilt thou make an end of
me.</hi> If God purpoſe to teach us by inward Sorrows, our Pride
of Heart, careleſsneſs, neglect of dependance upon him, the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
of Sin, or the like: the Devil will make us believe (and
we are too ready to ſubſcribe to him) that God proclaims open
War againſt us, and reſolves never to own us more. So did <hi>Job,
chap. 19. 6. Know now that God hath overthrown me, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
me with his Net:</hi> how often complained he, <hi>thou haſt
made me as thy mark, thou haſt broken me aſunder, thou haſt
taken me by my Neck and ſhaken me to peices?</hi> So alſo <hi>Heman,
Pſal. 88. 14. Why caſteſt thou off my Soul? why hideſt thou thy Face
from me?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Upon this occaſion the Devil is ready to envenome the Soul
with <hi>ſinful wiſhes</hi> and execrations againſt itſelf. Eminent Saints
have been tempted in their trouble to ſay too much this way, <hi>Job</hi>
ſolemnly curſed his Day; <hi>Job 3. 3. Let the Day periſh wherein I was
born, and the Night in which it was ſaid, there is a Manchild concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
&amp;c. So alſo <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> chap. 20. 14. <hi>Curſed be the Day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I was Born, let not the Day wherein my Mother bare me, be Bleſſed;
Curſed be the Man who brought tydings to my Father, ſaying a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child
is Born unto thee; and let that Man be as the Cities which God
overthrew, and repented not.</hi> Strange raſhneſs! what had the
Day deſerved? or wherein was the Meſſenger to be blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Violent Paſſions hurried him beyond all bounds of
reaſon and moderation. When troubles within are violent,
a ſmall puſh ſets Men forward; and when once they begin,
they are <hi>carried headlong</hi> beyond what they <hi>firſt</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>5. On this advantage the Devil ſometimes imboldens them to
<hi>quarrel</hi> God himſelf <hi>directly.</hi> When <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> curſed their
day, it was a contumely againſt God <hi>indirectly,</hi> but they durſt not
make bold with God at ſo high a rate as to quarrel him to his Face.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:49412:152"/>
Yet even this are Men brought to often, when their ſorrows are
<hi>long-laſting</hi> and <hi>deep.</hi> The Devil ſuggeſts, <hi>Can God be faithful, and
never keep Promiſe for help? can he be merciful when he turns away his
ears from the cry of the miſerable? where is his pity when he multiplies
his wounds without cauſe?</hi> Though at firſt theſe curſed intimations
do a little <hi>ſtartle</hi> Men, yet when by frequent <hi>inculcating</hi> they grow
more <hi>familiar</hi> to the Heart, the diſtreſſed break out <hi>in their rage,</hi>
with thoſe exclamations, <hi>Where is the faithfulneſs of God? where
are his Promiſes? hath he not forgotten to be gracious? are not his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
clean gone?</hi> And at laſt it may be Satan leads them a ſtep higher,
that is,</p>
                     <p>6. To a <hi>deſparing deſperateneſs.</hi> For when all Paſſages of relief are
ſtop up, and the burthen becomes great, Men are apt to be drawn
into <hi>rage and fury,</hi> when they think their burthen is <hi>greater than
they can bear,</hi> and ſee no <hi>hope of eaſe,</hi> in a kind of <hi>revenge</hi> they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
their anger againſt the hand that wounded them. The
Devil is officiouſly ready with his advice of <hi>Curſe God and die,</hi>
and they being <hi>full of anguiſh,</hi> are quickly made to comply with
it.</p>
                     <p>7. When 'tis at this height, the Devil hath but one Stage
more, and that is the ſuggeſting of <hi>irregular means</hi> for eaſe. Rage
againſt God doth not quench the inward burning; Blaſphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Heaven eaſeth not the Pain, the Soar runs ſtill and ceaſeth
not, the trouble continues, the Man cannot endure it longer, all
Patience and Hope is gone, what ſhall he do in this caſe? The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
offers his Service, he will be the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and commonly he
preſcribes one of theſe <hi>two</hi> things: 1. That 'tis beſt to endeavour
to break through all this trouble into a <hi>reſolved prophaneneſs;</hi> not to
ſtand in awe of Laws, nor to believe that there is a God that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
in the Earth, but that this is only the bitter fruit of <hi>melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,</hi>
and unneceſſary ſeriouſneſs, and therefore 'tis beſt; <hi>to eat,
drink and be merry.</hi> If a Man can thus eſcape out of his trouble, the
Devil needs no more; but oft he cannot, the wounds of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
will not be thus healed. Then, 2. He hath another remedy
which will not fail, as he tells them, that is, to <hi>deſtroy themſelves,</hi> to
end their troubles with their lives. How open are the Breaſts of
troubled Creatures to all theſe Darts? and were it not that God
<hi>ſecretly</hi> ſteps in, and <hi>holds</hi> the afflicted <hi>with his right hand,</hi> 'tis
ſcarce imaginable but that wounded Conſciences ſhould by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49412:152"/>
ſubtile improvement of ſo fair an advantage, be brought to
all this miſery.</p>
                     <p>8. Satan can afflict the <hi>Body,</hi> by <hi>the Mind.</hi> For theſe two are
ſo cloſely bound together, that their good and bad eſtate is ſhared
betwixt them. If the Heart be merry, the Countenance is chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
the Strength is renewed, the Bones do flouriſh like an Herb.
If the Heart be troubled, the Health is impaired, the Strength is
dryed up, the Marrow of the Bones waſted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Grief in the
Heart, is like a <hi>Moth</hi> in the Garment, it inſenſibly conſumeth the
Body, and diſordereth it. This advantage of weakening the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
falls into Satans hands by neceſſary conſequence, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ripe Figs, that fell into the Mouth of the Eater. And
ſurely he is well pleaſed with it, as he is an Enemy both to Body
and Soul: But 'tis a greater ſatisfaction to him, in that as he can
make the Sorrows of the Mind, produce the Weakneſs and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Body: So can he make the <hi>Diſtemper</hi> of the Body (by a
<hi>reciprocal requital)</hi> to augment the <hi>trouble</hi> of the Mind. How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
can a ſickly Body do? it diſables a Man for all Services, he
cannot oft Pray, nor Read, nor Hear. Sickneſs takes away the
Sweetneſs and Comfort of Religious Exerciſes; this gives occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for them to think the worſe of themſelves; they think the
<hi>Soul is weary</hi> of the ways of God, when the Body cannot hold out.
All failures which <hi>wearineſs</hi> and faintneſs produce, are aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
preſently to the <hi>bad diſpoſtion</hi> of the Mind, and this is like Oyl
caſt upon the Flame. Thus the Devil makes a double gain out of
Spiritual trouble.</p>
                     <p>9. Let it be alſo reckoned among the advantages which Satan
hath againſt Men from trouble of Spirit, that 'tis a <hi>contentment</hi> to
him to ſee them in their Miſeries; 'tis a <hi>ſport</hi> to him to ſee them
(as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks) take their Fleſh in their Teeth, and cry out in the
bitterneſs of their Souls; their groanings are his Muſick: when
they wallow in Aſhes, drown themſelves in Tears, roar till their
Throat is dry, ſpread out their Hands for help, then he <hi>gluts</hi> his
Heart in looking upon their woes. When they fall upon God
with their unjuſt Surmiſes, evil Interpretations of Providence,
queſtioning his Favour, denying his Grace, whiſhing they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been Born, then he <hi>claps</hi> his Hands and ſhouts <hi>a Victory.</hi> The
pleaſanteſt ſight to him, is to ſee <hi>God hiding</hi> himſelf from his
Child, and that Child <hi>broken</hi> with fears, <hi>torn</hi> in peices with griefs,
made a <hi>Brother to Dragons,</hi> a <hi>Companion</hi> to <hi>Owls,</hi> under <hi>reſtleſs
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:49412:153"/>
Anxities,</hi> perpetual <hi>Lamentations, feeble</hi> and ſore broken, their
Strength <hi>dryed</hi> like a Potſheard, their <hi>Throat</hi> dry, their <hi>Tongue</hi>
cleaving to their Jaws, their <hi>Bowels boyling,</hi> their <hi>Bones</hi> burnt
with Heat, their <hi>Skin black</hi> upon them, their <hi>Fleſh</hi> conſumed, their
<hi>Bones</hi> ſticking out, <hi>chaſtened</hi> with <hi>ſtrong</hi> pain upon their Bed.
This is one of Satan's delightful Spectacles, and for theſe ends
doth he all he can, to bereave them of their Comfort, which
we may the more certainly perſwade our ſelves to be true, when
we conſider the grounds forementioned, his <hi>malicious nature,</hi> the
<hi>advantages</hi> of Spiritual Peace, and the <hi>diſadvantages</hi> of Spiritual
trouble.</p>

                     <p>HAving evidenced that one of Satan's principal deſigns is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Peace and Comfort of God's Children; I ſhall
next endeavour a diſcovery of the <hi>various ways</hi> by which he doth
undermine them herein. All inward troubles are not of the ſame
<hi>kind</hi> in themſelves, neither doth Satan always produce the ſame
<hi>effects</hi> out of all. Some being in their own nature <hi>diſquiets,</hi> that
do not ſo <hi>directly,</hi> and immediately overthrow the Peace and Joy
of believing, and the Comforts of aſſurance of Divine Favour, as
others do. Yet ſeeing that by all, he hath no ſmall advantage
againſt us, as to <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Trouble,</hi> and that any of them at the <hi>long-run,</hi>
may lead us to <hi>queſtion</hi> our intereſt in Grace, and the Love of
God, and may accordingly afflict us, I ſhall ſpeak of them all;
which that I may do the more diſtinctly, I ſhall rank theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
into ſeveral <hi>heads,</hi> under <hi>peculiar names,</hi> (it may be not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ſo proper, but that the curious may find matter of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to them) that by them and their explanation, the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may the better appear. I diſtinguiſh therefore of a <hi>fourfold</hi>
trouble, that the Devil doth endeavour to work up upon the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:49412:154"/>
Hearts of Men. They are, 1. <hi>Diſcompoſures. 2. Affrightments.
3. Dejections of Sadneſs. 4. Diſtreſſes</hi> of Horrour. Of all which I
ſhall ſpeak in their order. And</p>
                     <p>1. Of <hi>Diſcompoſures</hi> of Soul. Theſe are <hi>Moleſtations</hi> and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances
by which the Mind is put <hi>out of order</hi> and made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet;
the calm (in which it ſhould enjoy it ſelf, and by which

trouble of <hi>Soul</hi> from the trouble of <hi>Conſcience</hi> is not new, others
have obſerved it before, and do thus explain it, Trouble of Soul
is <hi>larger</hi> than trouble of Conſcience; every <hi>troubled Conſcience</hi> is a
<hi>troubled Soul,</hi> but every troubled Soul is not a troubled Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
for the Soul may be troubled from Cauſes <hi>Natural, Civil,</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> according to <hi>variety</hi> of Occaſions and Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
when yet a Man's <hi>inward peace</hi> with God is firm; and in

there may be paſſions and diſturbances of Soul, when the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

                     <p>For the opening of theſe diſcompoſures of Soul, I ſhall, 1. Shew
upon what advantage of <hi>Natural Temper</hi> the Devil is encouraged
to moleſt Men. 2. By what <hi>occaſions</hi> he doth work upon our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Inclinations.</hi> 3. And with what <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of diſturbance to the
Soul.</p>
                     <p>1. As to our <hi>Natural Diſpoſitions,</hi> Satan (as hath formerly
been noted) takes his uſual <hi>indications</hi> of working from thence;
theſe guide him in his enterpriſes; his Temptations being ſuited
to Mens Tempers, proceed more ſmoothly and ſucceſsfully.
Some are of ſo ſerene and calm a diſpoſition, that he doth not
much deſign their diſcompoſure; but others there are, whoſe
Paſſions are more ſtirring, (ſit matter for him to work upon:)
and theſe are,</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>angry</hi> Diſpoſition. How great an advantage this gives
to Satan to diſturb the Heart, may be eaſily conceiv'd, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the various workings of it in ſeveral Men, according to
their different Humors; 'tis a Paſſion that acts not alike in all,
and for the differences (ſo far as we need to be concerned,) I
ſhall not trouble the Schools of Philoſophers, but content my
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:49412:154"/>
ſelf with what we have in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 31. where the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
it by <hi>three</hi> words, (not that they differ eſſentially) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
thereby the various ways of Angers working; the firſt is
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bains</hi> in loc.</note> which we tranſlate <hi>Bitterneſs.</hi> This is a diſpleaſure <hi>ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:</hi>
for ſome when they are angry cover it, and give it no vent,
partly for that they are ſometimes aſhamed to mention the ground
as trivial or unjuſt, partly from ſullenneſs of diſpoſition, and oft
from a natural reſervedneſs: while the flame is thus kept down,
it burns inwardly, and Men reſolve in their Minds many trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
vexatious thoughts. The ſecond word is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Wrath:</hi>
this is a fierce impetuous anger. Some are ſoon moved, but ſo
violent, that they are preſently tranſported into Rage and Frenzy,
or are ſo peeviſhly waſpiſh that they cannot be ſpoken to. The
third is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, tranſlated here <hi>Anger,</hi> but ſignifies ſuch a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
as is deep, entertaining thoughts of <hi>Revenge</hi> and Purſuit,
ſetling it ſelf at laſt into hatred. Any of theſe is enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave
the heart of its reſt, and to alarm it with diſturbances.</p>
                     <p>2. Others have an <hi>envious</hi> Nature, always maligning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining
at other Mens felicity; an evil Eye, that cannot look on
anothers better condition without vexation. This turns a Man
into a Devil, 'tis the Devil's proper ſin, and the fury that doth
unquiet him, and he the better knows of what avail it would
be to help on our trouble.</p>
                     <p>3. Some are of <hi>proud</hi> Tempers, always overvaluing themſelves
with the ſcorn and contempt of others. This humor is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
to all about them, but all this trouble doth at laſt redound
to themſelves; theſe think all others ſhould obſerve them, and
take notice of their ſuppoſed excellencies, which if Men do not,
then it pines them, or ſtirs up their Choler to Indignation. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
Prov. 30. 21. mentioning thoſe things that are greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting
in the Earth, inſtanceth in <hi>a Servant when he reigneth,
and the Hand-maid that is Heir to her Miſtris,</hi> intending thereby
the proud imperious inſolency of thoſe that are unexpectedly
raiſed from a low eſtate to Wealth or Honour: He that is of
<hi>a proud Heart ſtirreth up Strife,</hi> Prov. 28. 25. and as he is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to others, ſo doth he create trouble to himſelf; for he not
only moleſts himſelf by the working of his diſdainful thoughts,
while he exerciſeth his ſcorn towards others, <hi>(Prov. 21. 24. The
haughty Scorner deals in proud wrath)</hi> but this occaſions the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:49412:155"/>
and contempt of others again, which beget new griefs
to his reſtleſs Mind.</p>
                     <p>4. Some have a Natural <hi>exorbitancy of Deſire,</hi> an evil coveting;
they are paſſionately carried forth toward what they have not,
and have no contentment or ſatisfaction in what they do enjoy.
Such Humors are ſeldom at eaſe, their deſires are <hi>painfully</hi> violent,
and when they obtain what they longed for, they ſoon grow weary
of it, and then another object takes up their wiſhes, ſo that theſe
<hi>Daughters of the Horſleech are ever crying, Give, give,</hi> Prov. 30. 15.</p>
                     <p>5. Others have a <hi>ſoft effeminate</hi> Temper, a weakneſs of Soul
that makes them unfit to bear any burthen, or endure any hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Theſe if they meet with Pains or Troubles, (and who
can challenge an exemption from them?) they are preſently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient,
vexing themſelves by a <hi>vain reluctancy</hi> to what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
avoid; not but that extraordinary Burthens will make the
ſtrongeſt Spirit to ſtoop, but theſe cry out for the ſmalleſt matters,
which a ſtout Mind would bear with ſome competent chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>6. And there are other Diſpoſitions that are <hi>tender,</hi> to an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of Sympathy,</hi> ſo that they immoderatly affect and afflict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with other Mens ſorrows. Though this be a temper more
commendable than any of the former, yet Satan can take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of this, as alſo of the forenamed Diſpoſitions, to diſcompoſe
us, eſpecially by ſuiting them with fit occaſions which readily
work upon theſe Tempers: And this was</p>
                     <p>2. The ſecond things to be explained, which ſhall be performed
by a brief enumeration of them, the chief whereof are theſe,</p>
                     <p>1. Contempt <hi>or Diſeſtimation. When a Man's Perſon, Parts,
or Opinion are ſlighted, his Anger, Envy, Pride and Impatience
are awakened, and theſe make him ſwell and reſtleſs within.
Even good Men have been ſadly diſturbed this way.</hi> Job, <hi>as
holy a Man as he was, and who had enough of greater matters
to trouble his Mind, yet among other griefs, complains of this
more than once,</hi> Job. 12. 4. I am as one mocked of his Neighbour:
the juſt upright Man is laughed to ſcorn. <hi>Job</hi> 19. 15. They that dwell
in mine Houſe, and my Maids count me for a Stranger.—I called
my Servant, and he gave me no anſwer;—Yea, young Children de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
me, I roſe up and they ſpake againſt me. <hi>Thus he bemoans
himſelf, and (which is more) ſpeaks of it again with ſome</hi>
ſmartneſs <hi>of indignation,</hi> Job 30. 1. Now they that are younger
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:49412:155"/>
than I, have me in deriſion, whoſe Fathers I would have diſdained to
have ſet with the Dogs of my Flock. David <hi>alſo who had a ſtout heart
under troubles, complains that he could not bear reproaches,</hi>
Pſal. 69. Reproach hath broken mine Heart, I am full of heavineſs.
<hi>What theſe reproaches were, and how he was ſtaggered with
them, he tells us,</hi> Verſ. 10. I chaſtned my ſoul with faſting, that
was to my reproach. I made Sackcloth my Garment, and I became a
Proverb to them. They that ſit in the Gate, ſpeak againſt me; and I was
the Song of the Drunkards. <hi>With theſe he was ſo ſtounded, that if
he had not catch'd hold on God by Prayer, (as he ſpeaks,</hi> ver. 13.)
<hi>he had faln;</hi> But as for me, my Prayer is unto thee, O Lord, <hi>&amp;c. and
he afterward ſpeaks of his ſupport under Reproaches, as a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Divine aſſiſtance,</hi> Pſal. 119. 51. The Proud have had me in
deriſion, yet have I not declined from thy Law.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Injury</hi> is another occaſion by which the Devil works upon
our Tempers to diſquiet us. Wrongs of Injuſtice and Oppreſſion
are hard to bear, this is a common ground of trouble, good Men
cannot always acquit themſelves in this caſe as they ought. <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
when ſmitten by <hi>Paſhur,</hi> and put in the Stocks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 2, 7.
falls into a ſad paſſion, <hi>I am a deriſion daily, every one mocketh me,
I cried out, I cried violence and ſpoil,</hi> imitating the paſſionate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightments
of thoſe that cry, Murther, Murther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No wonder
ſeeing <hi>Solomon</hi> gives it as an <hi>axiom</hi> built upon manifold experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<hi>Eccl. 7. 7. Oppreſſion</hi> doth not only make a Man unquiet,
but <hi>Mad</hi> in his unquietneſs; and not only thoſe that are fooliſh
and haſty, but the moſt conſiderate and ſedate Perſons; <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
makes a wiſe Man mad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Another occaſion of Mens diſcompoſure, is the <hi>proſperity of
the Wicked:</hi> their abundance, their advancements to Honours and
Dignity hath always been a grudge to thoſe whoſe condition is
below them, and yet ſuppoſe themſelves to have better grounds
to expect preferment than they. This aſtoniſhed <hi>Job</hi> even to
trembling, <hi>Job 21. 7. When I remember, I am afraid, and trembling
taketh hold on my fleſh,</hi> and the matter was but this; <hi>Wherefore do
the Wicked live, become old, yea, and mighty in power?</hi> &amp;c. The trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that ſeizeth on Mens hearts on this occaſion, is called <hi>fretting,</hi>
a vexation that wears out the ſtrength of the Soul, as two <hi>hard</hi>
Bodies waſte by <hi>mutual attrition</hi> or rubbing. And it takes its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
from our envy chiefly, though other diſtempers come in
to help it forward, <hi>Pſal. 37. 1. Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of evil Doers,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:49412:156"/>
neither be thou envious againſt the workers of Iniquity. David</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
that he was apt to fall into this trouble, <hi>Pſal. 73. 3. I was
envious at the Fooliſh, when I ſaw the proſperity of the Wicked.</hi> Againſt
this diſquiet we have frequent cautions, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 1, 19. and
<hi>Pſal. 49. 16. Be not afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of
his houſe is increaſed.</hi> All which ſhew our proneneſs to this diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Croſſes</hi> and Afflictions give Satan an opportunity to work
upon our Paſſions. As diſappointments of Expectations, loſs
of Friends, of Eſtate, Perſecutions and Sufferings for Conſcience
ſake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> none of theſe in their own nature <hi>are joyous, but grievous:</hi>
and what uſe they have been of to the Devil to diſcompoſe the
minds of the Sufferers, is evidenced by common experience. The
Tears, ſad Countenances, and doleful Lamentations of Men are
true Witneſſes of the diſquiet of their hearts; every one being
preſſed with the ſenſe of his own ſmart, is ready to cry out, <hi>Is
there any ſorrow like my ſorrow? I am poor, and comfortleſs, my
Lovers and my Friends have forſaken me, and there is none to help.</hi>
Some grow faint under their Burthen, while their Eyes fail in
looking for redreſs, eſpecially when new unexpected troubles
overwhelm their hopes, <hi>When I looked for good, then evil came;
and when I waited for light, there came darkneſs,</hi> Job 30. 26. <hi>Why
haſt thou ſmitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace,
and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble,</hi>
Jer. 14. 19. and here they ſink, concluding there is no hope.
Others that bear up better in a bleſſed expectation of ſpiritual
profit, having that of <hi>David</hi> in their Eye, <hi>Bleſſed is the Man whom
thou afflicteſt, and teacheſt in thy Law:</hi> yet they cannot forbear their
complaints even to God, <hi>Pſal. 25. 17. The troubles of mine heart
are enlarged, O bring thou me out of my diſtreſſes, look upon mine afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and my pain.</hi> May thoſe that have had the higheſt advantages
of heavenly ſupport, whoſe hearts have been kept in peace,
counting it all joy that they have fallen into theſe trials, (and
God doth more this way, for thoſe that ſuffer for the Goſpels
ſake, than ordinarily for others) yet have not theſe been under
a <hi>Stoical ſenſleſſneſs</hi> of their trouble; though they were <hi>not diſtreſſed,
they were troubled on every ſide,</hi> though <hi>not in deſpair,</hi> yet they were
<hi>perplexed, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 8. though their Afflictions were <hi>light,</hi> yet were
they <hi>Afflictions</hi> ſtill.</p>
                     <p>5. To thoſe may be added the <hi>pain</hi> or anguiſh of <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> and
bodily Diſtemper. Though there are various degrees of pain, and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:49412:156"/>
that ſome Sickneſſes are leſs afflictive than others, yet none of
them forbear to pierce the Mind. The whole Man is diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
he that is exerciſed <hi>with ſtrong pains upon his Bed,</hi> cryes out in
the bitterneſs of his Soul, and he that by <hi>inſenſible</hi> degrees lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth,
grows ordinarily <hi>peeviſh,</hi> and his mind bleeds by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
wound, ſo that he <hi>ſpends his days in ſighing,</hi> and his years in
mourning. And others there are, who being before acquainted
with bodily pains, grow very impatient in Sickneſs, and are able
to bear nothing: and beſides the preſent ſence of pain, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of Death puts ſome into great commotion, the fears of
it, (for it is naturally dreadful) fills them with diſquiet thoughts,
and thoſe that approach to the Grave, by ſlow ſteps, under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
or languiſhing Sickneſſes, they are habituated to ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and can think of nothing <hi>chearfully,</hi> (except they have
great aſſurance of Salvation, and have well learned to dye) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Coffin, Grave, and Winding-ſheet are ſtill preſented to
them: theſe though they be very ſuitable Objects for Meditation,
and (well improved) of great advantage for preparation to
Death, yet doth Satan thereby (when it is for his purpoſe) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to keep Men under grief, and to bereave them of their
Peace.</p>
                     <p>6. Satan takes an advantage of trouble, from the <hi>Miſeries</hi> of
others. Sympathy is a Chriſtian Grace; and to bear one anothers
Burthens, to mourn with thoſe that mourn, ſhews us to be <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feeling
Members of the ſame Body,</hi> for <hi>if one Member ſuffer, all the
Members ſuffer with it.</hi> Yet are ſome Men naturally of ſo tender a
Conſtitution, that Satan overdrives them herein, every common
occaſion will wound them: the uſual effects of God's ordinary
Providence on the Poor, Lame, or Sick, are deeply laid to Heart
by them; and inſtead of being not <hi>unſenſible</hi> of other Mens Miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
they are <hi>not ſenſible</hi> of any thing elſe, neither do they enjoy
their own Mercies. And here, as Satan can every moment, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
them with objects of pitty, ordinary or extraordinary: ſo
upon a religious pretence of merciful conſideration, they are made
cruel to themſelves, refuſing their <hi>own peace,</hi> becauſe <hi>other</hi> Men are
not at <hi>eaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. The third particular, promiſed to be explained for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of theſe diſcompoſures of Soul, was this; That by a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currance</hi>
of theſe and ſuch like <hi>occaſions,</hi> to ſuch <hi>tempers,</hi> the Hearts
of Men are diſturbed, and their inward peace broken. This I ſhall
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:49412:157"/>
evidence by theſe <hi>three</hi> things: 1. That theſe <hi>occaſions</hi> meeting
with ſuch <hi>diſpoſitions,</hi> do naturally raiſe great <hi>diſturbances</hi> in their
preſent working. 2. That they have a tendency to <hi>further trouble.</hi>
3. That Satan doth <hi>deſign,</hi> and hath it ordinarily in his power
to <hi>diſcompoſe</hi> the Hearts of Men hereby.</p>
                     <p>1. That theſe occaſions, meeting with ſuch diſpoſitions, do
naturally raiſe great diſturbances. This is evident from what hath
been ſaid already: for (1.) All theſe diſpoſitions carry as much
<hi>Fire</hi> in their own Boſomes, as is ſufficient to burn up the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Corn of any Man's peace. What is anger, but an <hi>inward
burning,</hi> a reſtleſs confuſion of the Spirits, ſometime a Phrenſy,
a Diſtraction, a troubled Sea full of Rage, a wild Beaſt let looſe?
Envy, that is a <hi>fretful</hi> peeviſhneſs, a vexatious repining, needing
no other Tormentors but its own <hi>furies,</hi> recoiling upon him
that bred it, becauſe it cannot wreak its ſpite upon its Objects. An
envious Perſon is a <hi>Self-murtherer</hi> by the verdict of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> Job 5.
2. <hi>Wrath killeth the fooliſh Man, and envy ſlayeth the fooliſh one.</hi> This
is not barely to be underſtood of its <hi>provoking</hi> the Judge of all the
Earth to ſend down its deſerved deſtruction, but alſo (if not
chiefly) of its own <hi>corroding</hi> temper, which by long continuance
waſts the Strength, and conſumes the Body. Pride is a <hi>perpetual
vexation,</hi> creating its troubles from its own Fancy: irregular co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetings,
keep a Man ſtill upon the Rack, they make a Man like
the <hi>Tantalus</hi> of the Poets, they give a Man a <hi>caninus Appetitus,</hi> a
ſtrong Appetite with exceſſive greedineſs, and reſtleſs purſuit, and
<hi>conſtant diſſatisfactions,</hi> he is ever <hi>gaping</hi> and never <hi>enjoying.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
is a weariſome conflict with a burthen which it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>bear,</hi> nor yet <hi>ſhake off;</hi> where all the Fruit of the vain la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
amounts to no better account than this, that the Impatient
makes his burthen the <hi>greater,</hi> the bands that tye it on the <hi>ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
and the Strength that ſhould bear it the <hi>weaker.</hi> Laſtly, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of Pity, multiplies <hi>wounds without cauſe,</hi> it hinders a Man to
be <hi>happy,</hi> ſo long as there are any that are <hi>miſerable:</hi> he is always
(in reference to his quiet) at the Mercy of other Men, the afflicted
can torment him at a diſtance; and, by a kind of <hi>Magick,</hi> make
him feel the torments that are inflicted upon his Image. Who
can deny, but that Men that are ridden by ſuch vexatious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
muſt lead an unquiet Life, and always be toſſed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Tempeſts. Eſpecially (2) when we conſider, <hi>how fit</hi> the
forementioned <hi>occaſions</hi> are, to draw out theſe <hi>humours</hi> to their tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:49412:157"/>
extravagancies: a lighted Match and Gun-Powder, are
not more exactly ſuited to raiſe a ſhaking Blaſt, than thoſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and tempers are to breed an inward annoyance. Some of
theſe humours are ſo troubleſome, that rather than they will want
work, they will fight with their <hi>own Shadows,</hi> and by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs
of <hi>prejudicated Fancy,</hi> will create their own troubles, and
the beſt of them, which ſeem ſometime to take truce, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
themſelves to reſt, while occaſions are out of the way:
yet they are <hi>quickly awakened,</hi> like ſleeping Dogs that are rouſed
with the leaſt noiſe; what work then may we expect they will
make when they are ſummoned to give their appearance upon a
ſolemn occaſion? But (3) if we ſhould deal by inſtances, and
bring upon the Stage the effects that have been brought forth by
theſe concurring cauſes, it will appear that they make diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in good earneſt: let us either view the <hi>furious fits,</hi> that have
been like ſudden Flaſhes, ſooneſt gone; or their more <hi>laſting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,</hi>
and we ſhall find it true. As to violent Fits, raiſed by
ſuch occaſions and diſpoſitions, examples are infinite. What ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
outrages, Madneſſes, and extravagances have Men run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?
Some upon provocations, have furiouſly acted <hi>ſavage cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
and for ſmall matters have been carried to the moſt deſperate
revenges. Others have been brought to ſuch violent <hi>commotions</hi>
within themſelves, that the frame of nature hath been thereby
<hi>weakened,</hi> and overthrown. As <hi>Scilla,</hi> who in a ſtrong paſſion,
vomited Choler till he dyed. Some in their fury, have acted that
which hath been matter of <hi>ſorrow</hi> to them all their dayes. But
(omitting the examples of Heathens and wicked Men) let us
conſider the wonderful <hi>tranſports</hi> of holy Men. <hi>Moſes</hi> a Man emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
beyond compariſon, in Meekneſs; was ſo aſtoniſhed with
a ſudden ſurprize of trouble, at the Sight of the Golden Calf, that
he threw down the Tables of the Law, and brake them. Some
indeed obſerve from thence, a <hi>ſignificancy</hi> of <hi>Iſraels</hi> breaking the
Law, and forfeiting God's Protection, as his peculiar People, but
<hi>this</hi> is more to be aſcribed to the <hi>deſignment</hi> of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi>
that ſo ordered it, than to the <hi>intendment</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who no doubt,
did not this from a <hi>ſedate</hi> and calm <hi>deliberation,</hi> as purpoſing by
this act to tell <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo much; but was hurried by his grief (as not
conſidering well what he did) to break them. <hi>Aſa</hi> a good Man,
when he was reproved by the Prophet, (inſtead of thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of the reproof) grows angry, falls into a rage, and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:49412:158"/>
throws the Prophet into Priſon. <hi>Elias,</hi> diſcompoſed with <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebels</hi>
Perſecution, deſires that God would <hi>take away his Life.
Jonah,</hi> in his anger, falls out with God, and <hi>juſtifies</hi> it when he
hath done: ſurely ſuch Fits as theſe proceeded from great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
combuſtion. Would Wiſe, Sober, holy Men have ſaid
or done ſuch things, if they had not been tranſported <hi>beyond</hi>
themſelves? and though in ſuch caſes, the fits are ſoon over, yet
we obſerve that ſome are apt to fall into ſuch Fits <hi>often,</hi> and are ſo
<hi>eaſily</hi> irritated, that (like the <hi>epileptick</hi> Perſon poſſeſſed by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil)
upon every occaſion, they are by him, <hi>caſt into the Fire or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Water,</hi> and by the <hi>frequent return</hi> of their Diſtemper are <hi>never</hi>
at reſt.</p>
                     <p>As to others, whoſe tempers are more apt to <hi>retain</hi> a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Impreſſion, 'tis very obvious that their diſcompoſures have
as much in <hi>length</hi> and <hi>breadth,</hi> as the other had in <hi>height.</hi> You
may view <hi>Haman</hi> tormented under his ſecret diſcontent, which
his Pride and Envy formed in him, for the want of <hi>Mordicai</hi>'s
Obeyſance: the Kings Favour, a great Eſtate, high Honour, and
what elſe a Man could wiſh to make him content, are all ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up in this Gulph, and become nothing to him. You ſee
<hi>Amnon</hi> vexed and ſick, for his Siſter <hi>Tamer,</hi> waxing lean from
day to day. You ſee <hi>Ahab</hi> (though a King, who had enough to
ſatisfie his Mind) in the ſame condition for <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard.
If you ſay theſe were wicked Men, who rid their Luſts without a
Bridle, and uſed the Spur: look then upon better Men, and you
will ſee too much. <hi>Rachel</hi> ſo grieves and mourns for want of
Children, that ſhe profeſſeth her Life inconſiſtent with her diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
<hi>Give me Children, elſe I die. Hanna</hi> upon the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
weeps and eats not, and prays in the bitterneſs of her Soul,
and the abundance of her complaint and grief. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> (being
preſſed with diſcouragements from the contradiction of evil Men)
calls himſelf <hi>a Man of ſtrife and contention to the whole Earth, Jer.
15.</hi> 10. his ſorrows thence ariſing, had ſo imbittered his Life,
that he puts <hi>a woe</hi> upon his Birth, <hi>Wo is me, my Mother, that thou haſt
born me a Man of Strife. Paul</hi> had a noble courage under mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
afflictions, he could glory in the Croſs, and rejoice in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions:
nevertheleſs, the greatneſs of his work, the froward
perverſneſs and unſteadineſs of Profeſſors,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 2.</note> (which put him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
fears,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 19.</note> jealouſies, and new travel) the Miſeries of Chriſtians,
and the care he had for the concerns of the Goſpel, (which was a
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:49412:158"/>
conſtant load upon his Mind, his Heart (like old <hi>Eli</hi>'s) trembling
ſtill for the Ark of God) made him complain as one worn out
by the troubles of his Heart; 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 27. In wearineſs, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
in watchings often, in hunger and thirſt, in faſtings often, in
cold and nakedneſs. Beſides thoſe things that are without, that which
cometh upon me daily, the care of all the Churches. Who is weak, and I am
not weak?</hi> &amp;c. For the <hi>Jews</hi> he had great heavineſs and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ſorrow in his Heart;<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 2.</note> and for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> he had perpetual fears.
Now though he had a great ſhare of divine Comforts intermixed,
and a more than ordinary aſſiſtance of the Spirit, to keep him
from ſinful diſcompoſure of Spirit (at leaſt to ſuch an height, as
it ordinarily prevails upon others) yet was he very ſenſible of his
burthen, and doubtleſs the Devil laboured to improve theſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to weary out his ſtrength. For by theſe, and ſuch like things,
he frequently vexeth the righteous Souls of the faithful Miniſters
of the Goſpel from day to day: ſo that their hearts have no reſt,
and their hands grow often feeble, and they cry out, O the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then!
O the care! being ready to ſay as <hi>Jeremiah, chap. 20. 7. O
Lord, thou haſt deceived me, and I was decieved; I am a deriſion daily,
every one mocketh me.</hi> Thus ſay they, Did we ever think to meet
with ſuch diſappointments ſuch Griefs, from the Wilfulneſs, Pride,
Weakneſs, Ignorance, Pettiſhneſs, Inconſtancy, Negligence, and
Scandals of Friends? and ſuch Hatred, Contradictions, Scorns,
and Injuries from Enemies? Were we free, what Calling would
we not rather chuſe? what place would we not rather go to,
where we might ſpend the remainder of our dayes in ſome reſt and
eaſe? Were it not better to work with our hands for a Morſel of
Bread, for ſo might our Sleep be ſweet to us at Night, and we
ſhould not ſee theſe ſorrows? At this rate are good Men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
diſturbed, and the anguiſh of their Spirit makes their Life a
burthen.</p>
                     <p>2. Yet is not this all the diſturbance that the Devil works upon
our hearts by theſe things, (though theſe are bad enough) but
they have a tendency <hi>to further trouble.</hi> Diſcompoſures of Spirit, if
they continue <hi>long,</hi> turn at laſt into <hi>troubles of Conſcience.</hi> Though
there is no affinity betwixt ſimple diſcompoſure of Soul, and
troubles of Conſcience in their own nature; the objects of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
being things <hi>external,</hi> no way relating to the Souls Intereſt in
God and Salvation, which are the objects of the latter: yet the
effects produced by the prevalency of theſe diſturbances, are a fit
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:49412:159"/>
Stock for the ingrafting of doubts and queſtionings about our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
condition. As <hi>Saul</hi>'s Father firſt troubled himſelf for the
loſs of his Aſſes, and ſent his Son to ſeek them; but when he ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
long, he forgat his trouble, and took up a new grief for his
Son, whom he feared he had loſt in purſuit of the Aſſes. So is
it ſometime with Men, who after they have long vexed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for injuries or afflictions, &amp;c. upon a ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the working, and power of theſe Paſſions, leave their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
purſuit, and begin to bethink themſelves in what a condition
their Souls are, that abound with ſo much Murmuring, Rage,
Pride, or Impatience, and then the Scene is altered, and they
begin to fear they have loſt their Souls, and are now perplexed
about their Spiritual eſtate. To make this plain I will give ſome
<hi>inſtances,</hi> and then add ſome <hi>reaſons</hi> which will evidence <hi>that it is
ſo,</hi> and alſo <hi>how</hi> it comes to be ſo.</p>
                     <p>For Inſtances, though I might produce a ſufficient number to
this purpoſe, from thoſe that have written of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> yet I
ſhall only inſiſt upon two or three from Scripture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when God ſmote him with Sickneſs, at firſt was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed
upon the apprehenſion of Death, that he ſhould ſo ſoon
be deprived of the <hi>reſidue of his years, and behold Man no more with
the inhabitants of the World,</hi> as he himſelf expreſſeth it, <hi>Eſay 38.
10.</hi> afterward his trouble grew greater, <hi>He chattered as a Crane
or Swallow, and mourned as a Dove,</hi> he was in <hi>great bitterneſs, ver.</hi> 17.
and ſadly <hi>oppreſſed</hi> therewith, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. That which thus diſtreſſed
him was not ſimply the fear of Death, we cannot imagine ſo pious
a Perſon would ſo very much diſquiet himſelf upon that ſingle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
but by the expreſſions which he let fall in his complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
we may underſtand, that ſome ſuch thoughts as theſe did
ſhake him, that he apprehended God was <hi>angry</hi> with him, that
the preſent ſtroke ſignified <hi>ſo much</hi> to him,<note place="margin">2 Kings 20. 6. Vid. <hi>Light<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

a ſuppoſition of his Recovery, and a deep ſenſe of Iniquity)

Devil ſeeing now himſelf defeated, obtains a new Commiſſion,
wherein <hi>Job</hi> is wholly put into his hand, (life only excepted,
<hi>chap. 2. 9.)</hi> he ſets upon him again, and in his new encounter labours
to bring upon him ſpiritual diſtreſſes, and accordingly improves
his loſſes and ſufferings to that end, as appears by his endeavours
and the ſucceſs; for as he tempted him <hi>by his Wife</hi> to a deſperate
<hi>diſregard</hi> of God, that had ſo afflicted him, <hi>Curſe God and die,</hi>
ſo he tempted him alſo by <hi>his Friends,</hi> to <hi>queſtion</hi> the ſtate of his
Soul, and his Integrity, and all from the conſideration of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
miſeries. To that purpoſe are all their diſcourſes. <hi>Eliphaz
Chap.</hi> 4. 5, 6, 7. from his ſufferings and his carriage under them,
takes occaſion to jear his former Piety, (as being no other than
feigned) <hi>It is come upon thee, and thou fainteſt: is not this thy fear, thy
confidence, thy hope, and the uprightneſs of thy ways?</hi> that is, is
all thy Religion come to this? and alſo concludes him to be
wicked, <hi>Who ever periſhed being innocent? and where were the righteous
cut off?</hi> Bildad, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 6, 13. chargeth him with Hypocriſie
upon the ſame ground, and while he makes his defence, <hi>Zophar</hi>
plainly gives him the lye, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 3. and at this rate they go
their round; and all this while Satan (whoſe deſign it was to
afflict his Conſcience with the ſenſe of divine Wrath) <hi>ſecretly</hi>
ſtrikes in with theſe Accuſations, inſomuch, that though <hi>Job</hi>
ſtoutly defended his <hi>Integrity,</hi> yet he was wounded with inward
<hi>Diſtreſſes,</hi> and concluded, that theſe dealings of God againſt him
were no leſs than God's ſevere obſervance of his Iniquity; as is
plain from his bemoaning himſelf in <hi>Chap. 10. 2. I will ſay unto
God, Do not condemn me; ſhew me wherefore thou contendeſt with me.</hi>

                        <hi>David</hi> was a Man that was often exerciſed with Sickneſs and
Troubles from Enemies, and in all the inſtances almoſt that we
meet with in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> of theſe his Afflictions, we may obſerve
the outward occaſions of Trouble brought him under the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods Wrath, and his Iniquity; ſo that he was ſeldom
ſick, or perſecuted; but this called on the diſquiet of Conſcience,
and brought his ſin to remembrance; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. (which was
made on the occaſion of his Sickneſs, as appears from <hi>verſ. 5.)</hi>
wherein he expreſſeth the <hi>vexation</hi> of his <hi>Soul</hi> under the appehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Gods <hi>Anger;</hi> all his other griefs running into this Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
(as little Brooks loſing themſelves in a great River) change
their name and nature; he that was at firſt only concerned for
his Sickneſs, is now wholly concerned with ſorrow and ſmart
under the fear and hazard of his Souls condition; the like we
may ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. and many places more.</p>
                     <p>Having made good the aſſertion, That diſcompoſures of Soul
upon outward occaſions, by long continuance and Satans manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
do often run up to ſpiritual diſtreſs of Conſcience: I ſhall
next for further confirmation and illuſtration ſhew how it comes
to be ſo.</p>
                     <p>1. Diſcompoſures of Spirit do <hi>obſtruct,</hi> and at laſt <hi>extinguiſh</hi>
the inward <hi>comforts</hi> of the Soul: ſo that if we ſuppoſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed
Perſon at firſt (before he be thus diſordered) to have
had a good meaſure of ſpiritual joy in Gods favour, and delight
in his ways; yet the diſturbances, 1. <hi>Divert</hi> his thoughts from
<hi>feeding</hi> upon theſe Comforts, or from the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of himſelf in
them. The Soul cannot naturally be highly intent upon two
different things at once, but whatſoever doth ſtrongly engage
the Thoughts and Affections, that carries the whole Stream with
it, be it good or bad, and other things give way at preſent.
When the heart is <hi>vehemently</hi> moved on <hi>outward</hi> Conſiderations,
it lays by the thoughts of its ſweetneſs which it hath had in the
enjoyment of God; they are ſo contrary and inconſiſtent, that
either our Comforts will chaſe out of our Thoughts our Diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures,
or our Diſcompoſures will chaſe away our Comforts.
I believe the Comforts of <hi>Elias</hi> (when he lay down under his
grief, and deſired to die); and of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> (when he cried out
of violence) run very low in thoſe fits of Diſcontent, and their
Spirits were far from an actual rejoycing in God; but this is not
the worſt, we may not ſo eaſily imagine that upon the going
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:49412:160"/>
away of the fit, the wonted Comforts return to their former
courſe: For, 2. The Mind being <hi>diſtracted</hi> with its Burthen, is
left <hi>impotent</hi> and unable to return to its former exerciſe; the
warmth which the Heart had, being ſmothered and ſuſpended in
its excerciſe, is not ſo quickly revived, and the thoughts which
were buſied with diſturbance (like the diſtempered humors of
the Body) are not <hi>reduced</hi> ſuddainly to that evenneſs of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
as may make them fit for their <hi>old</hi> imployment. And 3. If
God ſhould <hi>offer</hi> the Influences of joyful ſupport, a diſcompoſed
Spirit is not in a capacity to <hi>receive</hi> them, no more than it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thoſe counſels that by any careful hand are interpoſed for its
relief and ſettlement. Comforts are not heard in the midſt of
noiſe and clamour; the <hi>calmneſs</hi> of the Souls faculties are praeſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
as a neceſſary <hi>qualification</hi> towards its <hi>reception</hi> of a meſſage
of Peace. <hi>Phineas</hi> his Wife being overcome of grief for the Arks
captivity and her Husbands death, could not be affected with the
joyful news of a Son. But 4. Sinful diſcompoſures <hi>hinder</hi> theſe
gracious and comfortable <hi>offers,</hi> if we could poſſibly (which we
cannot ordinarily) receive them, yet we cannot expect that
God will give them. The Spirit of Conſolation loves to take
up his lodging in a <hi>meek and quiet Spirit,</hi> and nothing more grieves
him than Bitterneſs, Wrath, Anger, Clamour, and Malice, which
made the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30, 31. ſubjoyn his direction of <hi>putting
theſe away</hi> from us, with his advice of <hi>not grieving the Spirit by
which we are ſealed unto the day of Redemption.</hi> And then 5. The
<hi>former ſtock</hi> of Comfort, which Perſons diſtempered with diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures
might be ſuppoſed to have, will ſoon be <hi>waſted,</hi> for our
Comforts are not like the <hi>Oil</hi> in the Cruſe, or <hi>Meal</hi> in the Barrel,
which had (as it were) their <hi>Spring</hi> in themſelves; we are
comforted and ſupported by <hi>daily communication</hi> of Divine Aid,
ſo that if the Spring head be ſtopped, the Stream will quickly
grow dry. 'Tis evident then, that inward Conſolations in God
will not <hi>ripen</hi> under theſe <hi>Shadows,</hi> nor <hi>grow</hi> under theſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<hi>droppings,</hi> ſeeing a diſcompoſed Spirit is not capable to <hi>receive</hi>
more, nor able <hi>to keep</hi> what comfort it had at firſt; we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
ſee how it comes to paſs that theſe diſturbances may in time
bring on ſpiritual troubles: for if our Comforts be once loſt,
Trouble of Conſcience eaſily follows. Where there is nothing to
fortify the Heart, the poyſon of malicious ſuggeſtions will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
prevail.</p>

2. Diſcompoſures of Soul afford the Devil <hi>fit matter</hi> to work
upon. They furniſh him with ſtrong objections againſt <hi>ſincerity
of Holineſs,</hi> by which the peace of Conſcience being ſtrongly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted,
is at laſt overthrown. The uſual Weapons by which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
fights againſt the aſſurance of Gods Children, are the <hi>guilt</hi> of
ſins committed, and the <hi>neglect</hi> of Duty, and the diſturbed Soul
affords enough of both theſe to make a Charge againſt it ſelf:
For,</p>
                     <p>1. Where there is much <hi>Diſcompoſure</hi> there is much <hi>Sin.</hi> If in
the multitude <hi>of words</hi> there wants not Iniquity, then much more
in the multitude of <hi>unruly thoughts.</hi> A diſturbed Spirit is like
<hi>troubled</hi> Water, all the <hi>Mud</hi> that lay at the bottom is raiſed up
and <hi>mixeth</hi> it ſelf with the Thoughts: If any injury or loſs do
trouble the Mind, all the Thoughts are tinctured with Anger,
Pride, Impatience, or whatſoever root of bitterneſs was in the
Heart before; we view them not ſingly as the iſſue of wiſe
<hi>Providence,</hi> but ordinarily we conſider them as done by ſuch <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and againſt our <hi>ſelves</hi> as malicious, ſpiteful, cauſleſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
wrongs, and then we give too great a liberty to our
ſelves to rage, to meditate revenge, to threaten, to reproach,
and what not? and if our Diſpoſition have not ſo ſtrong a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
inclination to theſe Diſtempers, yet the Thoughts by diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
are quickly leavened (it is the compariſon uſed by the
Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. to expreſs the power of Malice, (which is
an uſual attendant in this ſervice) to infect all the Imaginations)
with a ſharpneſs, which makes them ſwell into exorbitancy and
exceſs; hence proceed Revilings, Quarrelings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the
Tongue is thus <hi>fermented,</hi> it is <hi>a Fire, a World of Iniquity,</hi> (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
more ſins than can be reckoned) <hi>it defileth the whole Body,</hi>
(engaging all the faculties in heady purſuit,) <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
                     <p>2. Diſcompoſures obſtruct <hi>Duties.</hi> This is the inconvenience
which the Apoſtle <hi>(1 Pet. 3. 7.)</hi> tells us doth ariſe from diſturbances
among Relations; if the Wife or Husband do not carry well,
ſo that diſcontents or differences ariſe, <hi>their Prayers are hindered.</hi>
Duties then are obſtructed, 1. In the <hi>Act.</hi> When the Heart is
<hi>out of frame,</hi> Prayer is <hi>out of ſeaſon,</hi> and there is an averſneſs to it;
partly becauſe all good things are (in ſuch confuſions) <hi>burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome</hi>
to the <hi>Humor</hi> that then prevails, which eats out all deſire
and delight to ſpiritual things: and partly becauſe they <hi>dare
not</hi> come into <hi>Gods preſence;</hi> conſcience of their own guilt, and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:49412:161"/>
awe of God hindring ſuch approaches. 2. They obſtruct the
<hi>right manner</hi> of Performance, ſtraitning the Heart, and contracting
the Spirit, that if any thing be attempted, 'tis poorly and weakly
performed. 3. And alſo the <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of Duty is obſtructed by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure.
God <hi>will not accept</hi> ſuch Services, and therefore
Chriſt adviſeth to <hi>leave the Gift before the Altar,</hi> (though ready
for offering) where the Spirit is overcharged with Offences, or
angry Thoughts, and <hi>firſt to go and be reconciled to our Brother,</hi> and
then to <hi>come and offer the Gift,</hi> it being loſt labour to do it before.
From theſe ſins of Omiſſion and Commiſſion, Satan can (and
often doth) frame a dreadful charge againſt thoſe that are thus
concern'd, endeavouring to prove by theſe evidences, that they
are yet (notwithſtanding pretence of Converſion) in the gall
of Bitterneſs, and bond of Iniquity, whereby the peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is much ſhaken; and the more, becauſe alſo</p>
                     <p>3. Theſe diſcompoſures of Soul give Satan a <hi>fit ſeaſon</hi> for the
management of his Accuſation: Strong Accuſations do often ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
nothing, when the ſeaſon is unſutable. Many a time he hath
as much to ſay againſt the Comforts of Men, when yet they ſhake
all off (as <hi>Paul</hi> did the Viper off his hand) and fell no harm.
But that which prepares the Conſcience to <hi>receive</hi> the Indictment,
is a particular <hi>diſpoſition</hi> which it is wrought into, by <hi>ſuſpicious cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity</hi>
and fearfulneſs: Theſe make the Heart (as Wax to the Seal)
ready to take any impreſſion that Satan will ſtamp upon it: Now
by long diſturbances he works the Heart into this Mould very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and upon a <hi>double</hi> account he gains himſelf a fit opportunity
to charge home his exceptions. 1. In that he ſets upon the
Conſcience with his Accuſations, after the Heart hath been <hi>long
moleſted</hi> and confuſed with its other Troubles; for then the Heart
is weakned and <hi>unable</hi> to make <hi>reſiſtance</hi> as at other times. An
Aſſault with a freſh Party after a long conflict, diſorders its Forces
and puts all to flight. 2. In that long and great diſcompoſures
of Mind, bring on a diſtemper of <hi>Melancholy;</hi> for 'tis notoriouſly
known by common experience, that thoſe <hi>acid Humors</hi> (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
this diſtemper) which have their riſe from the Blood,
may be occaſioned by their violent Paſſions of Mind, the Animal
Spirits becoming inordinate (by long diſcompoſures of Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Envy, Terrour, and fretful Cares) and the motion of the
Blood being retarded, it by degrees departs from its tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and is infected with an acidity, ſo that Perſons no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:49412:162"/>
naturally to Melancholy may yet become ſo, by the diſquiets
of their troubled Mind.</p>
                     <p>Both theſe ways, but chiefly Melancholy, the Devil hath his
advantage for diſturbing the Conſcience. Melancholy (moſt
naturally) inclines Men to be ſolicitous for their Souls welfare;
but withall diſpoſeth them ſo ſtrongly to ſuſpect the worſt, (for
'tis a credulous ſuſpitious humour in things hurtful) and afflicts
ſo heavily with ſadneſs for what it doth reſpect, that when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
lays before Men of that humour their <hi>Miſcarriages</hi> under their
diſcontents, their Impatience, Unthankfulneſs, Anger, raſh Thoughts
and Speeches againſt God or Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> withall ſuggeſting that
ſuch an Heart cannot be right with God, after ſerious thoughts
upon Satan's frequently <hi>repeated</hi> Charge, they cry out, <hi>Guilty,
guilty,</hi> and then begins a new trouble for their Unregenerate
Eſtate, and their ſuppoſed loſt Souls.</p>
                     <p>4. In this caſe uſually Satan hath greater <hi>liberty to accuſe,</hi> and
by his Accuſations to moleſt the Conſcience, in that Men of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed
Spirits by the manifold evils ariſing thence <hi>provoke God
to deſert</hi> them, and to leave them in Satans hand to be brought
into an <hi>hour</hi> of Temptation. Satan's Commiſſion is occaſioned
by our Provocations, and the Temptations ariſing from ſuch a
Commiſſion, are uſually dreadful; they are <hi>ſolemn</hi> Temptations,
and called ſo after a ſingular manner; for of theſe I take thoſe
Scriptures to be meant, <hi>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
Mat. 26. 41. <hi>And lead us not into Temptation,</hi> Mat. 6. 13.
Such Temptations are not common Temptations, and are of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
force and hazard to the Soul, which way ſoever they are
deſigned, either for Sin or Terror. For ſeveral things do <hi>concur</hi> in
a ſolemn Temptation: As, 1. Satan doth in a ſpecial manner
<hi>challenge</hi> a Man to the Combate, or rather he <hi>challenges</hi> God to
give him ſuch a Man to fight with him, as he did concerning
<hi>Job.</hi> This Chriſt tells us of, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 31. Simon, <hi>Satan hath
deſired to have you;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> the word ſignifies a <hi>challenging</hi> or daring, and
it ſeems the Devil is oft daring God to give us into his hand,
when we little know of it. 2. There is alſo a ſpecial <hi>ſutableneſs
of Occaſion,</hi> and Snare, to the temper and ſtate of Men. Thus
he took <hi>Peter</hi> at an advantage in the High Prieſts Hall, and in
the caſe we now ſpeak of he takes advantage of Mens Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Melancholy. 3. There is always a <hi>violent proſecution,</hi>
which our Saviour expreſſeth under the compariſon of <hi>ſifting,</hi>
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:49412:162"/>
which is a reſtleſs agitation of the Corn, bringing that which
was at the bottom to the top, and ſhuffling the top to the bottom,
ſo that the Chaff or Dirt is always uppermoſt. 4. And to all this
there is <hi>divine permiſſion,</hi> Satan let looſe and we left to our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſtrength; as is implied in that expreſſion, <hi>He hath deſired to
have you, that he might ſift you.</hi> Now then if the Devil have ſuch
ground to give God a challenge concerning ſuch Men, and if God
do (as he juſtly may) leave ſuch Men (whoſe bitterneſs of
Spirit hath been as <hi>a ſmoak in his Noſtrils all the day)</hi> in Satans hand,
he will ſo ſhake them, that their Conſciences ſhall have no reſt.
And this he can yet the more eaſily effect, becauſe</p>
                     <p>5. Diſcompoſures of Spirit have a particular <hi>tendency</hi> to incline
our thoughts to <hi>ſeverity</hi> and harſhneſs, ſo that thoſe who have
had long and great diſturbances upon any outward occaſions, of
Loſs, Affliction, or Diſappointment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do naturally think (after
a ſolemn review of ſuch troubles) harſhly <hi>of God,</hi> and <hi>of themſelves;</hi>
they are ready to conclude that God is ſurely angry with them,
in that he doth afflict them, or that they have unſanctified hearts,
in that their thoughts are ſo fretful and unruly upon every incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
petty occaſion. 'Tis ſo ordinary for Men under the weight
of their Trouble, or under the ſenſe of their Sin, to be ſadly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
of Gods Wrath, and their Souls hazard, that it were
needleſs to offer Inſtances; let <hi>Davids</hi> caſe be inſtead of all. That
his troubles begot ſuch imaginations frequently, may be ſeen
throughout the Book of the <hi>Pſalms;</hi> we never read his complaints
againſt perſecuting Enemies, or for other Afflictions, but ſtill his
heart is affraid that God is calling Sin to remembrance; in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 38.
He is under great diſtreſs, and tells how low his Thoughts were;
he was <hi>troubled,</hi> greatly <hi>bowed down,</hi> he <hi>went mourning all the day
long;</hi> he expreſſeth his thoughts to have been, that <hi>God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
him,</hi> ver. 21. and his hopes (though they afterward revived)
were almoſt gone; he cryes out of his ſins, as having <hi>gone over
his Head,</hi> and become <hi>a Burthen too heavy for him,</hi> ver. 4. and
therefore ſets himſelf to confeſs them, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. He trembles at Gods
Anger, and feels the <hi>Arrows</hi> of God <hi>ſticking faſt</hi> in him, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.
But what occaſioned all this? the Pſalm informs us, God had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
him with <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> ver. 7. beſides that (for one trouble ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
comes alone) his <hi>Friends</hi> were perfidious, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. his
Enemies alſo were buſie, laying <hi>Snares</hi> for his life, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Now,
his thoughts were to this purpoſe, that ſurely he had ſome way
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49412:163"/>
or other greatly provoked God by his Sins, and therefore he fears
<hi>wrath</hi> in every <hi>rebuke,</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> in every <hi>chaſtiſement, ver.</hi> 1.
The like you may ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. where the Prophet upon the
occaſion of <hi>Sickneſs, ver.</hi> 3. and 23. and the <hi>reproach</hi> of Enemies,
<hi>ver.</hi> 8. is under great trouble, and ready to fail except ſpeedy
relief prevent, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. the reaſon whereof was this, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
theſe troubles were evident tokens of God's indignation
and wrath, <hi>becauſe of thine indignation and thy wrath, ver.</hi> 10. From
theſe five particulars we may be ſatisfied that it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
and alſo how it comes to be ſo, that ſometime trouble of
Conſcience is brought on, by other diſcompoſing troubles of the
Mind. For if theſe <hi>take away</hi> the Comforts, which ſupported the
Soul, and <hi>afford</hi> alſo arguments to the Devil to prove a wicked
Heart, and withal <hi>a fit ſeaſon</hi> to urge them to a deep impreſſion,
God in the mean time ſtanding at <hi>a diſtance,</hi> and the thoughts <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi>
inclined to conclude Gods Wrath from theſe troubles;
how impoſſible is it that Satan ſhould miſs of diſquieting the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
by his ſtrong vehement ſuggeſtions of wickedneſs and
deſertion?</p>
                     <p>In our enquiries after Satan's ſucceſs in working theſe diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures
of mind, we have diſcovered, 1. That the diſturbances
thence ariſing are great; 2. That they have a tendency to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Conſcience. There is but one particular more to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of relating to his ſucceſs in this deſign, and that is,</p>
                     <p>3. Theſe diſturbances are <hi>much in Satan's Power. Ordinarily</hi>
he can do it at pleaſure, except when God reſtrains him from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
ſit occaſions, or when (notwithſtanding theſe occaſions)
he extraordinarily ſuſpends the effect, which he frequently doth
when Men are enraged under ſuffering, upon the account of <hi>the
Goſpel</hi> and <hi>Conſcience;</hi> for then though they be bound up <hi>under Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
and Iron,</hi> yet the <hi>Iron enters not into the Soul;</hi> though they
are <hi>troubled,</hi> they are not <hi>diſtreſſed.</hi> Theſe <hi>Extraordinaries</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he can as eaſily <hi>diſcompoſe</hi> the Spirits of Men, as he can by
Temptation, <hi>draw</hi> them into other Sins, which may be evidenced
by theſe conſiderations:</p>
                     <p>1. We may obſerve, that thoſe, whoſe <hi>paſſionate</hi> tempers do <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually</hi>
tranſport them into greater vehemencies, are <hi>never</hi> out of
trouble. Their fits frequently return, they are never out of the
Fire, and this is, becauſe Satan is ſtill provided of occaſions ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their inclinations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="303" facs="tcp:49412:163"/>
2. Though God, out of his common bounty to mankind, hath
allowed him a comfortable being in the World, yet we find that
generally the Sons of Men under their various Occupations and
Studies, are wearied out with <hi>vexations of Spirit;</hi> this <hi>Solomon</hi> in
<hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> diſcovers at large in various imployments of Men, not
exempting the purſuit of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and Knowledg, <hi>(chap. 1. 18. In
much Wiſdom is much grief, and he that increaſeth Knowledg increaſeth
ſorrow)</hi> nor Pleaſures, nor Riches, for by all theſe he ſhews that
a Man is obnoxious to diſquiets: ſo that the general account of
Man's Life is but this, <hi>Eccleſ. 2. 23. All his days are ſorrows, and
his travel grief, yea his heart taketh not reſt in the night.</hi> That it
is ſo, is teſtified by common experience paſt denyal; but how it
comes to be ſo, is the enquiry: 'tis either from <hi>God,</hi> or from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
working by occaſions upon our tempers. That 'tis not from
God is evident: for though ſorrow be a part of that <hi>Curſe,</hi> which
Man was juſtly doomed unto, yet hath he appointed ways and
means by which it might be ſo <hi>mitigated,</hi> that it might be tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
without <hi>diſcompoſure</hi> of Spirit; and therefore <hi>Solomon,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning,
in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> to ſet forth the chief good, ſhews that
felicity conſiſts not in the common abuſe of outward things, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that brings only vexation) but in the <hi>fear of God</hi> leading to
future happineſs, and in the mean time, in a <hi>thankful, comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
uſe</hi> of things preſent without anxiety of Mind. Hence doth
he fix his concluſion (as the reſult of his experience) and often
repeats it; <hi>There is nothing better for a Man, than that he ſhould Eat
and Drink, and that he ſhould make his Soul enjoy good in his Labour.
Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 24. &amp; 3. 12, 13. &amp; 5. 18, 19. Not that <hi>Solomon</hi> plays the
<hi>Epicure,</hi> giving advice <hi>to eat and drink, for to morrow we die;</hi> nor
that he ſpeaks <hi>deridingly</hi> to thoſe that ſeek their felicity in this
life, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>If ye do terminate your deſires upon a terrene
felicity, there is nothing better then to eat and drink,</hi> &amp;c. But he
gives a ſerious <hi>poſitive</hi> advice, of enjoying the things of this life
with <hi>cheerfulneſs,</hi> which he affirms proceeds from the ſole bounty of
God, as his ſingular gift; <hi>It is the gift of God,</hi> Eccleſ. 3. 13. <hi>'tis our
portion,</hi> that is, our allowance, Eccleſ. 5. 19.) for theſe two expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<hi>[our Portion,</hi> and <hi>God's gift]</hi> they are of the ſame ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with <hi>Solomon</hi> here) and when a Man hath power to enjoy this
allowance in comfort, 'tis <hi>God</hi> that <hi>anſwereth him in the joy of his
heart,</hi> ver. 20. 'Tis plain then, that God <hi>ſows good Seed in his
Field;</hi> the ſpringing up therefore of theſe Tares of vexation, which
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:49412:164"/>
ſo generally afflict the Sons of Men, muſt be aſcribed to this, <hi>the
Enemy hath done it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis alſo a conſiderable ground of ſuſpition that Satan can
do much in diſcompoſures of Spirit, in that ſometimes thoſe
whoſe tempers are <hi>moſt cool</hi> and <hi>calm,</hi> and whoſe ſingular <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi>
upon, and communion with God, muſt needs more <hi>ſtrengthen</hi>
them againſt theſe paſſionate vexations, are notwithſtanding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
into violent commotions. <hi>Moſes</hi> was naturally meek,
above the common diſpoſition of Men, and his very buſineſs was
converſe with God, whoſe preſence kept his Heart under a bleſſed
awe; yet upon the Peoples murmuring, he was ſo tranſported,
with fullenneſs and unbelief at the waters of <hi>Meribah,</hi> Numbers
20. 10, 12. that <hi>it went ill with him:</hi> which <hi>David</hi> thus expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
Pſal. 106. 33. <hi>they provoked his Spirit, ſo that he ſpake unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
with his Lips.</hi> Who can ſuppoſe leſs in this matter, than
that Satan, having him at advantage, hurried him to this raſhneſs?
ſpecially ſeeing ſuch vehemencies were not <hi>uſual</hi> with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
that his natural temper led him to the contrary. This hath ſome
affinity with the next conſideration, Which is,</p>
                     <p>4. That when Men moſt <hi>foreſee</hi> the occaſions of their trouble,
and do moſt <hi>fear</hi> the trouble that might thence ariſe, and moſt
<hi>firmly deſign</hi> to keep their hearts quiet, yet are they oft forced (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all care and reſolution) upon <hi>extravagant</hi> heats. <hi>David</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
and ſtrenuouſly endeavoured, to poſſeſs his Soul in Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Patience, (for what could be more, than ſolemn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement?
<hi>Pſal. 39. 1. I ſaid I will look to my ways,</hi> and what
endeavours could be more ſevere, than to keep himſelf <hi>as with Bit
and Bridle?</hi> what care could be more hopeful to ſucceed, than to
be <hi>dumb with ſilence?)</hi> yet for all this, he could not keep his Heart
calm, nor reſtrain his Tongue, <hi>ver. 3. My Heart waxed hot within
me, while I was muſing, the Fire burned, then ſpake I with my Tongue.</hi>
Who ſuſpects not the hand of Satan in this?</p>
                     <p>5. 'Tis alſo remarkable, that when we have <hi>leaſt reaſon</hi> to give
way to diſcompoſure, when we have <hi>moſt cauſe</hi> to avoid all provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
yet then we have <hi>moſt occaſions</hi> ſet before us. When we

if we have not theſe <hi>ſolemn</hi> affairs to wait upon; we ſhall
have <hi>fewer</hi> of theſe occaſions of vexation to attend us. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be attributed to meer <hi>contingency</hi> of occaſions, nor yet to our
<hi>tempers</hi> ſolely; for why they ſhould be moſt <hi>apt</hi> to give us trouble,
when they are moſt <hi>engaged</hi> to calmneſs, cannot well be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for; 'tis evidently then Satan, that maliciouſly directs theſe
occaſions (for they have not a malicious ingeniouſneſs to prepare
themſelves, without ſome other chief mover) at ſuch times as he
knows would be moſt to our prejudice.</p>
                     <p>Theſe general conſiderations amount to more than a ſuſpition
that it is much in Satan's power to give diſturbances to the Minds
of Men; yet for the clearer manifeſtation of the matter I ſhall
ſhew, that he can do much to bring about <hi>occaſions</hi> of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure,
and alſo to <hi>ſtir</hi> up the Paſſions of Men upon theſe
occaſions.</p>
                     <p>1. That <hi>occaſions</hi> are much in his hand, I ſhall eaſily demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.
For 1. There being <hi>ſo many</hi> occaſions of vexation to a
weak craſy Mind, we may well imagine, that one or other is ſtill
occuring, and while they thus offer themſelves Satan needs not be
idle for want of an opportunity. 2. But if common occaſions do
not ſo exactly ſuit his deſign, he can <hi>prepare</hi> occaſions; for ſuch
is his <hi>foreſight</hi> and contrivance, that he can put ſome Men (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their privity to his intentions, or any evil deſign of their
own) upon ſuch <hi>actions</hi> as may (through the ſtrength of prejudice,
miſinterpretation, or evil inclination) be an offence to others; and
in like manner, can <hi>invite</hi> thoſe to be <hi>in the way</hi> of theſe offences.
I am ready to think, there was a contrivance of Satan (if we well
conſider all circumſtances) to bring <hi>David</hi> and the Object of his
Luſt together; while <hi>Bathſhebah</hi> was Bathing, he might uſe his
Art in private motions to get <hi>David</hi> up to the Roof of his Houſe.
But more eſpecially can the Devil prepare occaſions that do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<hi>upon the wickedneſs of his Slaves;</hi> theſe are Servants under his
command, he can <hi>ſay to one, God, and he goes; and to another, Come,
and he comes.</hi> If contempt, or injury, affronts or ſcorns, &amp;c. be
neceſſary for his preſent work againſt any, whom he undertakes
to diſturb, he can eaſily put his Vaſſals upon that part of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
and if he have higher imployment for them, he ever finds
them forward. And hence was it that when <hi>Satan</hi> deſigned to
plunder <hi>Job,</hi> he could quickly perform it, becauſe he had the
<hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans</hi> ready at a call. 3. If both theſe ſhould
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:49412:165"/>
fail him, he can eaſily awaken in us, the <hi>memory</hi> of <hi>old</hi> occaſions
that have been heretofore a trouble to us: theſe being raiſed out of
their Graves, will renew old diſturbances, working afreſh the
<hi>ſame</hi> diſquiets, which the things themſelves gave us at
firſt.</p>
                     <p>If Satan's power were bounded here, and that he could do no
more than ſet before Men occaſions of vexation, yet we might
juſtly, on that ſingle account, call him the <hi>troubler</hi> of the Spirits
of Men; conſidering, that naturally the thoughts of Men are reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
and their imaginations ever rowling. If Men ſequeſter
themſelves from all buſineſs, if they ſhut themſelves up from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with Men; turn <hi>Eremites,</hi> (as <hi>Jerom</hi> did) on purpoſe to
avoid diſquiet, yet their thoughts would <hi>hurry</hi> them from place to
place, ſometimes to the <hi>Court,</hi> ſometimes to the <hi>Market,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to <hi>Shews</hi> and Paſtimes, ſometimes to <hi>quarrellings,</hi> ſometimes
they <hi>view</hi> Fields, Buildings and Countries, ſometimes they <hi>fancy</hi>
Dignities, Promotions and Honours, they are ever working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one object or other, real or ſuppoſed; and according to the
object, ſuch will the affections be, high or low, joyful or ſorrowful:
ſo that if the utmoſt of what Satan could do, were no more than
to provide occaſions, diſcompoſures would follow naturally.
The evil diſpoſitions of Men would thereby be ſet a working,
though Satan ſtood by as an <hi>Idle Spectator.</hi> The <hi>Serpent</hi> (in our
Breaſts, as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us <hi>Eccleſ. 10. 11.)</hi> would <hi>bite without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment,</hi>
that is, except it were charmed. But Satan can do more
than tempt <hi>objectively,</hi> when he hath provided the Fewel he can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
bring Fire: For,</p>
                     <p>2. He can alſo ſet our paſſions <hi>on work,</hi> and incenſe them to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
fury than otherwiſe they would arrive at. We ſee perſons that
are diſtempered with paſſion, may be whetted up to an higher
pitch of rage, by any officious <hi>Flatterer,</hi> that will <hi>indulge</hi> the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
and <hi>aggravate</hi> the Provocation. Much more then can Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
do it by <hi>whiſpering</hi> ſuch things to our Minds as he knows will
increaſe the Flame; and therefore is it, that where the Scripture
doth caution us againſt <hi>anger,</hi> (as the proper product of our own
corruption, calling it <hi>our wrath,</hi> Eph. 4. 26, 27.) There alſo it
warns us againſt <hi>the Devil,</hi> as the <hi>incendiary,</hi> that endeavours to
heighten it. And where it tells us of the diſorders of the tongue
(which, though <hi>a little Member, can</hi> of it ſelf do <hi>great miſchief, Jam.
3. 6.)</hi> there it alſo tells us, that the <hi>Devil</hi> brings it an <hi>additional</hi>
                        <pb n="307" facs="tcp:49412:165"/>
Fire from <hi>Hell; It is ſet on Fire of Hell.</hi> And there are ſeveral
ways by which Satan can irritate the Paſſions. As,</p>
                     <p>1. By preſenting the occaſions <hi>worſe</hi> than they are, or were
ever intended, unjuſtly <hi>aggravating</hi> all circumſtances. By this means
he makes the object of the paſſions the more diſpleaſing, and
hateful; this muſt of neceſſity provoke to an higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                     <p>2. He can in a natural way move (as it were) the <hi>Wheels,</hi> and
ſet the paſſions a going, if they were of themſelves more dull and
ſluggiſh: for he hath <hi>a nearer acceſs</hi> to our Paſſions than every
one is aware of. I will make it evident thus: our Paſſions, in their
workings,<note place="margin">Vid. Willis de anima Brut. <hi>cap. 8. &amp;</hi> 9.</note> do depend upon the fluctuations, excurſions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
of the Blood, and animal Spirits, as <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines:
Now that Satan can make his approaches to the <hi>Blood,
Spirits</hi> and <hi>Humors,</hi> and can make <hi>alterations</hi> upon them, cannot
be denied, by thoſe that conſider what the Scripture ſpeaks in
<hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, and in the caſes of thoſe, that were by poſſeſſion of the
Devil,<note place="margin">Job 2. 7.</note> made <hi>Dumb, Deaf</hi> or, <hi>Epileptick:</hi> for if he could afflict
<hi>Job</hi> with <hi>grievous Boils,</hi> 'tis plain he diſordered and <hi>vitiated</hi> his
Blood and Humors, which made them apt to produce ſuch Boils
or Ulcers; and if he could produce an <hi>Epilepſy,</hi> 'tis evident that
he could infect the <hi>Lympha</hi> with ſuch a ſharpneſs, as by vellicating
the Nerves, might cauſe a Convulſion: and theſe were much more
than the diſorderly Motions of Blood, Spirits or Humors which
raiſe the paſſions of Men. If any <hi>object</hi> to this, That then (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
Satan's malicious diligence) we muſt expect the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Men would never be at reſt. 'Tis <hi>anſwered,</hi> that this
power of Satan is not <hi>unlimited,</hi> but oft <hi>God prohibits</hi> him ſuch
approaches, (and without his leave he can do nothing); and alſo
<hi>grace</hi> in God's Children, working <hi>calmneſs,</hi> ſubmiſſion and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
doth <hi>ballance</hi> Satan's contrary endeavour. For as hurtful
and vexatious occaſions, being repreſented by the Sence to the
imagination; are apt to move the Blood and Spirits: ſo on the
contrary, the <hi>Ballaſt</hi> of Patience and other Grace, doth ſo <hi>ſettle</hi>
the Mind, that the Blood and Spirits are kept ſteady in their uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
courſe.</p>
                     <p>3. When the Paſſions <hi>are up,</hi> Satan can by his ſuggeſtions make
them <hi>more h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ady</hi> and violent. He can ſuggeſt to the Mind <hi>Motives</hi>
and Arguments to forward it, and can ſtir up our <hi>natural</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:49412:166"/>
with all its powers to ſtrike in with the opportunity.
Thus he not only kindles the Fire, but blows the Flame.</p>
                     <p>4. And he can further <hi>fix</hi> the Mind upon theſe thoughts, and
keep them ſtill upon the Hearts of Men. And then they eat in
the deeper, and like Poyſon, diffuſe their malignity the further.
We ſee that Men, who are at <hi>firſt</hi> but in an <hi>ordinary</hi> fret, if they
continue to <hi>meditate</hi> upon their Provocation, they increaſe their
vexation, and if they give themſelves to <hi>vent</hi> their Paſſions by their
Tongues, though they begin in ſome moderation, yet as motion
cauſeth heat, ſo their own words whet their rage, according to
<hi>Eccleſ. 10. 13. The beginning of the words of his Mouth is fooliſhneſs,
but the latter end of his talk is miſchievous madneſs.</hi> The ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
hath Satan againſt Men by <hi>holding down</hi> their thoughts to
theſe occaſions of diſcompoſure.</p>
                     <p>If occaſions be ſo much in Satan's power, and he have alſo ſo
great an hand over Mens Paſſions, 'tis too evident that he can do
very much to diſcompoſe the Spirits of Men, that are naturally
obnoxious to theſe troubles, except God reſtrain him, and Grace
oppoſe him. Thus have I ſpoken my thoughts of the firſt ſort
of troubles, by which Satan doth undermine the peace of Mens
Hearts.</p>

troubling the fancy; and ſaying, <hi>deny God, Curſe God,</hi> and
then adds, <hi>ſuch was the Thorn in the Fleſh given to the Apoſtle.</hi>
But whether this was the trouble of the Apoſtle, or ſome other
thing (for ſeveral things are conjectured, and nothing can be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
proved) we are ſure (from the ſad experience of many)
that ſuch troubles he doth often give; which I ſhall <hi>firſt</hi> explain
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:49412:167"/>
in the <hi>general,</hi> and then give a <hi>particular</hi> of theſe frightful inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>1. To explain the nature and burthen of this kind of trouble,
I ſhall preſent you with a few <hi>obſervations</hi> about them. As,</p>
                     <p>1. Theſe aſtoniſhing thoughts, are purely <hi>injections,</hi> ſuch as
Satan <hi>caſts</hi> into the Mind, and not what the Mind of it ſelf doth
<hi>produce,</hi> as one expreſſeth it, they are more <hi>darting</hi> than <hi>reflecting.</hi>
Not but that our natural corruption could <hi>of it ſelf</hi> beget Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
or Atheiſtical Thoughts, but when they have their riſe
from <hi>our ſelves</hi> ſolely, they do not <hi>ſo ſtartle</hi> us, having ſome ſhare
(at leaſt) of <hi>our conſent</hi> going along with them, they appear not
ſo ſtrange. But in this caſe in hand, Satan is the <hi>Agent,</hi> and Men
are the <hi>Sufferers,</hi> their Underſtandings and Souls being buſied all
the while to repel them, with the utmoſt of their reluctances.
And to thoſe that do thus ſtrive againſt them, making reſiſtance
with all their ſtrength, with Tears and Prayers, they are only their
<hi>Afflictions,</hi> but not their <hi>Sins.</hi> For the Thoughts are not polluted
by the <hi>ſimple apprehenſion</hi> of a ſinful Object, no more than the Eye
is defiled by <hi>beholding</hi> loathſome and filthy things: for then ſhould
the Mind of <hi>Chriſt</hi> have been defiled, when <hi>Satan</hi> propounded
himſelf, blaſphemouſly, as the <hi>Object</hi> of his Worſhip, his Mind as
truly apprehended the meaning of that ſaying <hi>[fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me]</hi> as ours can do, when he caſts ſuch a thing immediately
into our Thoughts. Which is a conſideration to be obſerved di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
by thoſe that meet with ſuch ſad exerciſe; if they do
truly apprehend that they are but their ſufferings, and that God
will not charge the Sin upon them, they will more eaſily bear and
overcome the trouble.</p>
                     <p>Theſe injections are commonly <hi>impetuous</hi> and <hi>ſudden,</hi> frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compared to Lightning: and this is uſually made a note of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
betwixt wicked blaſphemous thoughts riſing from <hi>our
natural corruption,</hi> and <hi>darted in</hi> by Satan; the former being
more <hi>leaſurely, orderly,</hi> and <hi>moderate</hi> according to the uſual courſe
of the procedure of <hi>humane</hi> thoughts, the latter uſually accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with an <hi>haſty violence, ſubtilly,</hi> and <hi>incoherently</hi> ſhooting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Underſtandings, as Lightning into an Houſe. So that
all the Strength we have, can neither <hi>prevent</hi> them nor <hi>expel</hi> them,
nor ſo much as <hi>mitigate</hi> the violence of them.</p>
                     <p>3. They are alſo for the moſt part <hi>inceſſant,</hi> and conſtant Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

where they once begin. Though Satan hath <hi>variety,</hi> in
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:49412:167"/>
regard of the matter of theſe amazing injections, (for ſometimes
he affrights one Man with blaſphemous Thoughts, another, with
Atheiſtical Thoughts, a third with grievous unuſual Temptations
to Sin, as Murther, &amp;c.) yet, uſually, he <hi>fixeth</hi> his Foot upon
what he <hi>firſt</hi> undertakes. And as cunning Huntsmen, do not
change their Game that they firſt rouſe, that they may ſooner
ſpeed in catching the Prey; ſo what frightful thought Satan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
the trouble with, that he perſiſts in, and is withal ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his purſuit, that he gives little intermiſſion. He makes
theſe unwelcom thoughts haunt them like Ghoſts, whitherſoever
they go, whatſoever they do; he will give ſolemn onſet it may
be <hi>twenty</hi> or <hi>forty</hi> times in a day: and at this rate he continues, it
may be for ſome conſiderable time, ſo that they are not quit of
the trouble for ſeveral <hi>Months,</hi> or it may be <hi>Years.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. The matter of theſe Affrightments, are things moſt <hi>contrary</hi>
to the <hi>Impreſſions</hi> of Nature, or Grace, and therefore <hi>moſt odious</hi>
and troubleſome. When he is upon this deſign, things that are
moſt contrary to the belief and inclination of Men are beſt for his
purpoſe. As Men that intend to affright others, chuſe the moſt
<hi>ugly viſors,</hi> the <hi>ſtrangeſt garbs</hi> and <hi>poſtures,</hi> and make the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
<hi>inhumane</hi> noiſes; and the more monſtrous they appear, the
better they ſucceed in their purpoſes. Yet Satan doth not always
chuſe the <hi>very worſt,</hi> for then moſt of the troubles of this kind,
would be about the <hi>ſame thing,</hi> but he conſiders the ſtrength of
our <hi>perſwaſions,</hi> our <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> in Truths, the <hi>probability</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability
of an <hi>after-game</hi> with us; and accordingly ſometimes
refuſeth to trouble us with injections, contrary to what we are
<hi>moſt firmly</hi> rooted in, chuſing rather that which (though contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to our thoughts and reſolves) we have not been fixed in,
without <hi>a great deal of labour,</hi> and which (if there be occaſion)
might moſt fitly be <hi>charged</hi> upon us as our own, ſo that (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
other Suggeſtions would be ſlighted, as apparent Malice, and
<hi>Scarecrows)</hi> theſe are moſt <hi>afflicting,</hi> (as being an aſſault againſt
ſuch a Fort which <hi>coſts us</hi> much to rear, and which we are moſt
afraid to loſe,) and moſt lyable to his <hi>accuſation</hi> after a long
continuance, as being the iſſue of our own unſetledneſs.</p>
                     <p>5. The firſt and moſt obvious effects of theſe injections, are
the <hi>utmoſt abhorrency of the Mind,</hi> (which preſently ſtartles at the
appearance of ſuch odious things,) and the <hi>trembling</hi> of the Body,
ſometimes to an agony and fainting. The invaſion of <hi>one ſingle</hi>
                        <pb n="312" facs="tcp:49412:168"/>
injection, hath put ſome into ſuch an heart-breaking affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they have not recovered themſelves in a <hi>whole days
time.</hi> This <hi>trembling</hi> of the Body, and <hi>agony</hi> of the Mind, are the
uſual conſequences of any thing that is <hi>ſurpriſing,</hi> ſtrange and
fearful: and therefore is trembling of the Body made, by Divines,
a <hi>mark</hi> to diſcover, that theſe hideous blaſphemous thoughts are

and moleſtation of the Mind, when it is forced againſt its own
<hi>natural bent</hi> and inclination, to harbour ſuch Monſters within it
ſelf? how would nature reluct and abominate the drinking down
of noiſome pudled Water, or the ſwallowing of Toads and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents?
(and hence was it that Perſecutors in their deviliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
invented ſuch kind of Tortures) and what leſs doth
the Devil do, when he forceth Blaſphemies upon their Thoughts?
and commits <hi>a rape</hi> by a malicious violence upon their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
<hi>David</hi> under theſe Temptations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 21. crys out,
<hi>Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins:</hi> and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be otherwiſe, for the reaſon already mentioned. Nature ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors
to be forced to what is moſt contrary to it ſelf, and ſo doth
Grace. Now the things by which Satan works theſe Affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are contrary to Nature or Grace, or both together; and as
they will ſtrive to the utmoſt of their ability to caſt out what
is ſo oppoſite to them, ſo muſt the Devil to the utmoſt of
his ability (if he would carry his deſign) ſtrength himſelf in
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:49412:168"/>
his force, and from hence (as when Fire and Water are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
together) ariſeth a moſt troubleſome conflict; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
if there were a <hi>compliance</hi> of our conſent, there would be <hi>no
Affrightment;</hi> neither can this kind of Temptation be managed,
except there be the <hi>utmoſt diſſent</hi> of the Mind. If any think there
is no great <hi>ground</hi> for theſe Temptations, becauſe ſome of the
particulars by which he is ſaid to affright Men are <hi>natural</hi> to us,
as (for inſtance) <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> Thoughts (which are by ſome called
the <hi>Maſter-vein</hi> of our original Corruption, and by others, ſaid
to be in the heart of <hi>every</hi> Man naturally) and then conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not ſo troubleſome as is imagined, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, That when
Divines call theſe, or blaſphemous Thoughts, natural, they do
not mean that they are <hi>natural impreſſions engraven on us by Creation</hi>
(for they aſſert the contrary) that 'tis a <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>unextinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
impreſſion upon every Man that <hi>there is a God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Perkins <hi>Caſes of Conſcience.</hi> l. 1. cap. 10. § 2.</note> &amp;c. and uſually
give in this for proof, that the greateſt <hi>Atheiſts</hi> in <hi>fear</hi> and extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will manifeſt a <hi>ſecret belief</hi> of a Deity, by calling out, <hi>O God,</hi> &amp;c.
or by ſome other <hi>poſture,</hi> (as <hi>Caligula</hi> by hiding himſelf when it
thundered) but they mean only, that our <hi>natural corruption may
produce theſe Thoughts,</hi> and that they are the natural iſſues thereof;
and therefore <hi>Perkins</hi> in anſwer to a queſtion of this nature,<note place="margin">Treatiſe of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> tells
us, that theſe <hi>two</hi> Thoughts <hi>[there is a God]</hi> and <hi>[there is no
God]</hi> may be, and are <hi>both</hi> in the <hi>ſame</hi> heart. Now as this will
give us the <hi>reaſon</hi> why Satan doth make <hi>choice</hi> of theſe Thoughts
to trouble us withall, which may <hi>alſo</hi> riſe from our ſelves, (which
I have hinted before, and ſhall preſently again touch upon:) ſo it
tells us ſtill, that whether theſe Thoughts ariſe from our own
Corruption, or from Satan, our <hi>natural impreſſions</hi> are ſtrong againſt
them, and withall that they cannot be <hi>ſo</hi> affrightful but when
<hi>Satan</hi> doth manage them, and when the contrary impreſſions of
Nature are awakened to give <hi>ſtrong reſiſtance,</hi> and then that ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
muſt be as the tearing of our Bowels, and ſtill the worſe in
that we are inceſſantly purſued: Satan ſtill caſting back (with
unwearied labour) the ſame Thoughts as they are repulſed and
rejected; as Souldiers that beſiege Cities uſe to caſt over the Walls
their fir'd <hi>Granado's.</hi> (2.) Theſe are alſo grievous, as they ſet
the Mind upon the <hi>Rack,</hi> and ſtretch it under laborious and
<hi>doubtful enquiries</hi> after the grounds or <hi>cauſes</hi> of this kind of trouble,
for the Heart aſtoniſhed with ſuch curſed Gueſts againſt his Will,
preſently reflects upon God and it ſelf, <hi>What have I done? and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:49412:169"/>
wherefore am I thus diſquieted with Monſters? why doth the Righteous
Lord ſuffer Satan to break open my Heart, and fill me with ſuch fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Thoughts?</hi> but when Mens enquiries are not ſo high, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in a conſideration of the <hi>nature</hi> of the trouble and <hi>manner</hi>
of its working, without looking up to the Providence of God,
then are their troubles <hi>increaſed.</hi> (3.) As theſe Injections neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate
Men in their own defence, to <hi>oppoſe,</hi> and every way to
reſiſt, 'tis an increaſe of the Burthen: What Pleadings are they
put to? what Defiances? what endeavours to call off the thoughts?
and all to little purpoſe; while the trouble continues, they are
forced to ly in their Armour, and to be conſtantly in their Ward.
(4.) And yet are they further troubleſome in the <hi>After-Game</hi> that
Satan plays by theſe Thoughts. 'Tis not all of his deſign to affright
Men, but he uſually hath another Temptation to come in the
<hi>rear</hi> of this, and that is to turn theſe <hi>Affrightments</hi> into <hi>Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and by urging them <hi>long</hi> upon the hearts of Men, to make
them believe that they are their <hi>own</hi> Thoughts, the iſſues of their
own natural Corruption, and after Men are by continual Aſſaults
weakned, their Senſes and Memory dulled, their Underſtanding
confounded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they eaſily conclude againſt themſelves; The
Tempter imputes all the horrid Blaſpemy to them, boldly calls
them guilty of all; and becauſe their Thoughts have dwelt long
upon ſuch a <hi>Subject,</hi> and withall knowing that corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>it ſelf</hi> will lead Men to ſuch horrid Blaſphemies or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies
(which makes it <hi>probable</hi> that it might be their own fault,
and for this <hi>reaſon</hi> Satan makes choice of ſuch Injections as may
in the Accuſation ſeem moſt <hi>likely</hi> to be true) being ſtrongly
charged as guilty,<note place="margin">Vid. Dickſon T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fearful than the former: Oh! what ſad thoughts have they then
of themſelves? as the moſt vile blaſphemous Wretches! ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they think, <hi>that 'tis impoſſible that other Mens Hearts ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
ſuch intollerable things within them as theirs; and that none was
ever ſo bad as they:</hi> ſometimes they think, <hi>that if Men knew what
vile imaginations and monſtrous things are in their Minds, they would
in very Zeal to God and Religion ſtone them, or at leaſt exclude them
from all commerce with Men; ſometimes they think their Sin to be the
Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; ſometimes they think God is engaged in point
of Honour to ſhew upon them ſome remarkable Judgment, and they verily
look for ſome fearful ſtroke to confound them, and live under ſuch a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
expectation.</hi> Theſe and many more to this purpoſe are their
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:49412:169"/>
thoughts, ſo that theſe Temptations are every way troubleſome
both in their firſt and ſecond effects.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have in the general expreſſed the <hi>nature</hi> of theſe affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
what the particular injections are by which he ſtudies
to affright Men, I ſhall next declare. They are principally
<hi>ſix:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Atheiſtical Thoughts.</hi> By injecting theſe into the Mind, he
doth exceedingly affright Men, and frequently for that end doth
he ſuggeſt, that there is no God, and that the Scriptures are
but deluſive contrivances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Concerning theſe I ſhall note a few
things. As,</p>
                     <p>1. Though there be an obſervable difference betwixt <hi>Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
injections,</hi> and <hi>Temptations to Atheiſme,</hi> not only in the <hi>deſign,</hi>
(Satan chiefly intending <hi>ſeduction</hi> in the latter, and <hi>affrightment</hi> by
the former) but alſo in the <hi>manner</hi> of proceeding: (for when he
deſigns <hi>chiefly</hi> to tempt to Atheiſm, he firſt prepares his way by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching</hi>
the Conſcience with vitious or negligent living. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. that which makes Men <hi>ſay in their Hearts there
is no God,</hi> is this, that <hi>they are corrupt, and have done abominable
works;</hi> and in this method was famous <hi>Junius</hi> tempted to Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.
But when he <hi>chiefly</hi> intends to affright, he ſets upon Men,
that by a <hi>watchful</hi> and ſtrict converſation cut off from him that
advantage) yet he doth <hi>ſo manage</hi> himſelf, that he can turn his
courſe <hi>either way,</hi> as he finds probability of ſucceſs after tryal; for
he preſſeth on upon Men moſt, where he finds them <hi>moſt to yeild,</hi>
ſo that thoſe who were but at firſt affrighted, may at laſt be ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſwaded and urged to believe the ſuggeſtion to be true, if
they give him any incouragement for ſuch a procedure.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Contemplative Heads</hi> and great Searchers are uſually moſt
troubled in this manner, partly becauſe they ſee <hi>more difficulties</hi>
than other Men, and are more <hi>ſenſible</hi> of Humane inability to
reſolve them, and partly becauſe God (who will not ſuffer his
Children to be tempted <hi>above what they are able)</hi> doth <hi>not permit</hi>
Satan to moleſt the <hi>weaker</hi> ſort of Chriſtians with ſuch dangerous
aſſaults.</p>
                     <p>3. Perſons of eminent and ſingular <hi>Holineſs</hi> may be (and often
are) troubled with Atheiſtical thoughts, and have ſad conflicts
about them, Satan labouring (where he cannot prevail for a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
entertainment of Atheiſm) at leaſt to <hi>diſquiet</hi> their Minds
by haunting them with his Injections, if not to <hi>weaken</hi> their aſſent
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49412:170"/>
to theſe Fundamental Truths, in which he ſometimes ſo prevails,
that good Men have publickly profeſſed, that they have found it
an harder matter to believe that there is a God, than moſt do
imagine.</p>
                     <p>4. Satan lies at the <hi>catch</hi> in this deſign, and uſually takes Men
at the advantage, <hi>ſuddenly</hi> ſetting upon them, either in the <hi>height</hi>
of their Meditations and Enquiries into Fundamental Truths,
(for when they ſoar aloft, and puzzle themſelves with a difficulty,
then is he at hand to adviſe them to cut the knot which they
cannot unlooſe) or in the <hi>depth</hi> of their Troubles, (for when
Men cannot reconcile the daily Afflictions and Sufferings which
they undergo, with the love and care of God toward his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
then 'tis Satans ſeaſon to tell them that there is no ſupream
Diſpoſer of things); in both theſe caſes the Devil leaps upon
them unawares (like a Robber out of a Thicket) who if he do
not wound them by the Dart of Atheiſtical Injection, at leaſt he
is ſure to aſtoniſh them, and to confound them with amazement.
For,</p>
                     <p>5. Sometimes he purſues with wonderful <hi>violence,</hi> and will <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute</hi>
with admirable ſubtilty, urging the <hi>inequality</hi> of Providence,
the <hi>ſeeming contradictions</hi> of Scripture, the <hi>unſuitableneſs</hi> of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
to an infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, with many more
Arguments of like kind; and this with ſuch unexpected acuteneſs,
and ſeeming demonſtration, that the moſt holy Hearts and wiſeſt
Heads ſhall not readily know what to anſwer, but ſhall be forced
to betake themſelves to their Knees, and to beg of God that he
would rebuke Satan, and uphold them that their Faith fail not:
Nay, he doth not only diſpute, but by urging, and (with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
earneſtneſs) <hi>threaping</hi> the Concluſion upon Men, doth
<hi>almoſt force</hi> them to a Perſwaſion, ſo that they are almoſt carried
off their Feet whether they will or no. Which was the very caſe
of <hi>David</hi> (when the Devil purſued him with Atheiſtical thoughts
on the occaſion of the proſperity of wicked Men, and his daily
Troubles,) <hi>Pſal. 73. 2. My Feet were almoſt gone, my Steps had
well-nigh ſlipt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. Yet for all this, he ſometimes lays aſide his Sophiſtical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
and betakes himſelf to an <hi>Impudent Importunity;</hi> for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he inſiſts only on <hi>one</hi> Argument, not changing that which
he firſt took up, nor ſtrengthening his Suggeſtion with variety of
Arguments, but by frequent repetition of the ſame Reaſon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:49412:170"/>
to urge his injected Atheiſm. This gives no diſcovery of
any deep reach if he deſigned to perſwade, (for 'tis ſcarce rational
to imagine, that ſerious Men, who by many Arguments are fully
perſwaded there is a God, ſhould readily loſe their hold upon the
appearance of one Objection,) but it ſhews that he purpoſeth
only to moleſt. And this appears more evidently, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
himſelf with weak and <hi>trivial</hi> Arguments, which the afflicted
Party can anſwer fully, and yet cannot for all that quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of the trouble: for inſtance, 'Tis not very many years ſince
a ſerious and pious Perſon came to me, and complained, that he
could not be at reſt for Atheiſtical thoughts that perpetually
haunted him, and upon a particular enquiry into the cauſe and
manner of his Trouble, he told me the firſt riſe of it was from
his Obſervation, that I had interpreted ſome Scriptures otherwiſe
than he had heard ſome others to have done; but withall, he
added, that he knew the reaſon of his perplexity was but ſilly,
and that which he could eaſily anſwer: This being no juſt charge
againſt the Scripture, (whoſe ſenſe and truth might for all that
be one, and uniform to it ſelf) but only an implication of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
weakneſs appearing in the different apprehenſions of Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors;
yet notwithſtanding, he affirmed he could not ſhake off the
trouble, and that his thoughts were ever urged with the ſame
thing for a long time together; nay, ſuch is his impudency in
this kind of trouble, that thoſe who know 'tis the beſt way <hi>not
to diſpute</hi> Fundamentals with Satan, but with abhorrency to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
him (after the example of Chriſt) with a <hi>Get thee behind me
Satan,</hi> and accordingly do with their utmoſt ſtrength reject them,
yet they find that he doth not readily deſiſt.</p>
                     <p>How ſad is this Trouble? how are pious Perſons affrighted to
ſee the Face of their Thoughts made abominably ugly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by theſe violent and unavoidable Injections? 'tis not only
<hi>weariſome</hi> to thoſe that know it to be ſolely <hi>Satans malice,</hi> but it
often proves to be an <hi>aſtoniſhing ſurpriſal:</hi> like that of a Traveller,
who while he paſſeth on his way without foreſight or thought
of danger, is ſuddenly brought to the top of a great Precipice,
where when he looks down to the vaſt deep below, his Head ſwims,
his Heart pants, his Knees tremble, and the very fear of the ſudden
danger ſo confounds him that he is (through exceſſive dread)
ready to fall into that which he would avoid: ſo are theſe amazed
at ſo great hazards before them. Satan could not by all his Art
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:49412:171"/>
prevail with them to abandon the holy ways of God in exchange
for the pleaſures of Sin, and now they ſeem to be in danger to
loſe all at once, and yet 'tis more affrightful by far to thoſe that
charge (though Satans cunning) all this Atheiſm <hi>upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Another affrightful Injection; is that of <hi>blaſphemous Thoughts,</hi>
as that God is not juſt, not compaſſionate, that Scriptures and
Ordinances are but low and ſorry things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Satan doth delight to force ſuch Thoughts upon Men, is
evident, (1.) From his <hi>Nature.</hi> He is a <hi>blaſphemous</hi> Spirit, and
withal ſo <hi>malicious,</hi> that whatſoever is in his curſed Mind, he will
be ready to vent upon all occaſions. (2.) From his <hi>Practice:</hi> for
where he can obtain the rule over Mens Imaginations, (as in
ſome diſtracted Perſons, and thoſe that are diſtempered with
Feavers,) he uſually makes them vomit for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Oaths, Curſings,
and Blaſphemies, and this he doth to ſome that (while they have
had the uſe of their Reaſon) have not been obſerved to give their
Tongue the liberty of ſwearing, or curſed ſpeaking. (3.) From
his <hi>profeſſed Deſign</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> concerning whom he boaſted
to God himſelf, that he would make him curſe him to his face,
and accordingly tempted him by his Wife to curſe God and die.
(4.) From the ſad <hi>experience</hi> of thoſe that have ſuffered under this
ſad Affliction; for many have complained of blaſphemous
Thoughts, and thoſe whom he cannot conquer, he will thus
trouble. Neither need we think it ſtrange that the Devil can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Blaſphemies upon the Imaginations of Men <hi>againſt their wills,</hi>
when we conſider that he could make <hi>Saul</hi> (in his fits) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have

then may Satan poſſeſs the Fancies of Men with Blaſphemies? ſo
that the <hi>unwilling</hi> may be troubled with them, and thoſe that are
deprived of the benefit of Reaſon, may (from the power of the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:49412:171"/>
impreſſion upon their imagination) vent them with a kind of
unwilligneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Melancholy Perſons</hi> do very frequently meet with this kind of
Trouble, Satan having a great power upon their <hi>Imagination,</hi> and
great <hi>advantages</hi> from the darkneſs of that Humor, to make the
fear ariſing from ſuch thoughts the more <hi>aſtoniſhing,</hi> and to <hi>delude</hi>
them into an apprehenſion that they are guilty of all that paſſeth
through their thoughts, and alſo to work this perplexity to more
<hi>diſmal effects.</hi> In theſe kind of Men he doth play the <hi>Tyrant</hi>
with ſuch Injections, abuſing them to ſuch an height, as if they
were his Vaſſals and Slaves, whoſe Thoughts and Tongues were
in his (and not their own) keeping; and ſo ſtrongly doth he
poſſeſs them with this perplexity ſometimes, that all the counſels,
reaſonings, or advice of others, cannot in the leaſt ſatisfie or
relieve them; yet notwithſtanding I have known ſeveral under
this Affliction, who (when by <hi>Phyſick,</hi> the ſtate of their Bodies
hath been altered) have found themſelves at eaſe immediately,
the Trouble gradually and inſenſibly ceaſing of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Others there are that have great vexation from theſe Thoughts,
and theſe are commonly ſuch as by ſome <hi>long</hi> and grievous Pain,
Sickneſs or other Croſſes, have their Spirits <hi>fretted</hi> and imbittered;
then is Satan ready to ſuggeſt, that God is cruel, or regardleſs
of his People; and theſe Thoughts are the more dreadful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
fretting and murmuring Spirits have a natural tendency to
to think harſhly of God; ſo that Satan in this caſe doth with the
more <hi>boldneſs</hi> obtrude theſe Suggeſtions upon them, finding ſo
great a forwardneſs toward ſuch Imaginations, and alſo with
greater <hi>ſeverity</hi> he doth <hi>reflect</hi> upon them, as being in ſome likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
compliant and conſenting.</p>
                     <p>When other Perſons (not ſo concerned as theſe two ſorts of
Men above mentioned) are aſſaulted with blaſphemous thoughts,
the fits are <hi>leſs permanent,</hi> and (becauſe they eaſily <hi>diſcover</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
and Author of them) not highly affrightful, though ſtill
troubleſome.</p>
                     <p>The burthen of theſe injections are much like the former, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſadly afflicting. For who can eaſily bear the <hi>noiſe</hi> of Satan while
he ſhouts continually into their Ears odious Calumnies, and
Blaſphemous Indignities againſt God? <hi>David</hi> could not hear wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men blaſpheme God, but it was <hi>as a Sword in his Bones,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
painful: the impreſſions of <hi>Nature,</hi> (that teach us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:49412:172"/>
and honour God) the power of <hi>Education</hi> (that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
theſe impreſſions) the <hi>perſwaſion</hi> of Faith (that aſſures us of
the reality and infinite Excellency of a Godhead) and the force
of Love (that makes us more ſenſibly apprehenſive of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
or Diſhonour done to him whom we love above all): <hi>all
theſe</hi> do ſuffer by theſe violent Incurſions of Satan, and the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer
finds himſelf to be pained and tortured in theſe <hi>noble parts.</hi>
How grievous muſt it be to a Child of God, to have his Ear <hi>chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
to theſe intollerable ingrateful Reproaches? Eſpecially when we
conſider that the Devil will in this caſe, utter the <hi>moſt dreadful</hi>
Blaſphemies he can deviſe, which will ſtill add to the Affliction,
(for even thoſe Men that through habit, can well bear ordinary
petty Oaths, will yet ſtartle at outragious prodigious Swearing)
and therefore what ever <hi>Covert</hi> and conſequential Blaſphemies
may be to ſome Men, theſe <hi>impudent</hi> hideous abuſes of the Holy
and Juſt God, muſt needs ſadly trouble thoſe that are forced to
hear them. And the more <hi>conſtant</hi> the greater trouble. Who
would not be weary of their Lives, that muſt be forced to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
this Vexation ſtill without intermiſſion? And yet, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
can advance the trouble a little higher by the <hi>Apparatus,</hi> or
Artificial Dread, which he puts upon the Temptation in the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of the injection. As the <hi>Roaring</hi> of the Lion increaſeth terrour
in the Beaſts of the Field, who without that, would tremble at
his preſence; and as the <hi>Thundering</hi> and Lightning at the giving
of the Law, increaſed the fear of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> So when Satan is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this deſign, he <hi>ſhakes</hi> as it were the Houſe, and makes a noiſe
that the fright may be increaſed.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Suſpicious fears</hi> of being excluded out of Gods eternal <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of Election,</hi> is another of his affrightments. This is, when
Satan boldly takes upon him to <hi>determine</hi> God's ſecret Counſel
concerning any Man; peremptorily aſſerting, that <hi>he is none of
Gods Elect.</hi> In which caſe he often doth only inject the <hi>ſuſpicion
confidently,</hi> without <hi>offer</hi> of Proof; or if he uſe Arguments, they
never amount to a proof of his Aſſertion, (neither is it poſſible
they ſhould, for theſe are among <hi>God's ſecrets,</hi> and out of Satans
reach) though poſſibly they may prove the Perſon to be <hi>not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi>
at preſent. So that this kind of trouble differs exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
from thoſe diſquiets of Temptation, which frequently Men
ſuffer about their <hi>ſtate</hi> of Regeneration. And indeed, the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi>
ſhould not be <hi>confounded,</hi> it being of great concern to Men,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:49412:172"/>
when their Peace is aſſaulted, to be able to obſerve the difference
betwixt theſe two Aſſertions, <hi>Thou art not Elected:</hi> And, <hi>Thou
art not yet Regenerated.</hi> Seeing the latter being granted, there yet
remains a hope of the <hi>Probability,</hi> or <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of that Mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
afterwards: (the ſuſpitions of Non-converſion are more
common, and not ſo dangerous); Nay, in Unregenerate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
the fears of their being yet in that condition (being joyned
with diligence and care to avoid the danger) are neceſſary, and
advantagious; but) the former being granted, <hi>all hopes</hi> are, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with that conceſſion, <hi>laid off,</hi> which muſt needs make the
affrightment intollerable. In this we may obſerve,</p>
                     <p>1. That Satan for the better management of this Deſign,
doth not only inject theſe ſuſpitions in the moſt <hi>dreadful Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi>
(as <hi>Thou art a loſt and damned Wret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>h, hopeleſly miſerable to
all Eternity: God hath not Elected thee to Life, but prepared for thee
(as a Veſſel of wrath) the Lake of fire and Brimſtone for ever,</hi> &amp;c.)
But alſo he doth aſſert them with the higheſt <hi>Peremptorineſs</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
as if he had <hi>Authority</hi> from God to pronounce a Sentence
of Condemnation againſt a Man: This muſt needs amaze the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
unſpeakably.</p>
                     <p>2. In this he alſo <hi>obſerve his Advantages:</hi> For there are ſome
Men ſo ſadly ſuited to this Deſign, that Satan comes better to
ſpeed upon them, than others. Uſually he fixeth his Eyes,
1. Upon <hi>young Perſons</hi> at their <hi>firſt</hi> ſerious attendances upon,
and conſiderations of Scripture Truths. Their hearts are then
<hi>tender,</hi> (Youth hath a natural tender-heartedneſs; we find them
coupled together in <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s Character, 2 <hi>Chron. 13. 7. When</hi>
Rehoboam <hi>was young, and tender-hearted)</hi> and they are apt to
receive ſtrong impreſſions. When thoſe who were formerly
mindleſs of their Spiritual concern, begin to be ſerious, they
can no ſooner fall upon a Conſideration of thoſe weighty Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines:
That there are <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Goats,</hi> ſome <hi>Saved,</hi> and ſome
<hi>Damned;</hi> that the Bleſſed are <hi>few,</hi> in compariſon of the <hi>many</hi>
that take the Broad-way to deſtruction, and that theſe were from
Eternity <hi>ordained unto</hi> Life, and <hi>theſe only,</hi> &amp;c. No ſooner (I
ſay) begin they to ponder theſe things, but Satan is ready with
this ſuſpition, <hi>And what doſt thou know, but thou art one of theſe
excluded Wretches? If but few are ſaved, a thouſand to one thou art
none of them? For why ſhould God look upon thee more than another?</hi>
Theſe are his firſt Aſſays with Young-Men, beginning to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:49412:173"/>
in which afterward he proceeds with greater boldneſs, as
he ſeeth occaſion. 2. He alſo doth this to Perſons that are <hi>ſome
way quickned</hi> to a devotional fear of God, and care of their Souls,
but withal are <hi>ignorant,</hi> and not able <hi>diſtinctly</hi> to apprehend, and
<hi>orderly</hi> to range the Doctrines of the Scriptures into a due <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency</hi>
with one another. Their <hi>careful fears</hi> make them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into what God hath ſaid concerning the everlaſting ſtate of
Men; and before they can be able to <hi>digeſt</hi> the Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Satan ſets ſome Truths <hi>edg-ways</hi> againſt them, which put
them into great affrightment, while (through their ignorance)
other Truths (appointed and declared for the ſatisfaction of the
minds of thoſe that hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come in to their relief. How ſtartling muſt the truths of
Gods Election be, when they ſtand forth <hi>alone,</hi> and are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the <hi>Invitations</hi> of the Goſpel, that promiſe
<hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Acceptance</hi> to all that will come in and ſubmit to
Chriſt? Satan uſually holds ſuch kind of Men, to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe Truths, that have the moſt <hi>diſmal Aſpect,</hi> and while
they are ſtopt there, they can draw forth no other concluſions
than theſe, <hi>That they are in hazard, and for ought they know, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
loſt.</hi> 3. Satan hath alſo this Plot againſt thoſe that by ſome
<hi>grievous</hi> iniquity, or <hi>long continuance</hi> in ſin, have highly provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the Lord. Here he uſeth Arguments from the heinouſneſs
of their Iniquity; thou art a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> becauſe thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
theſe <hi>great evils,</hi> theſe are <hi>marks</hi> of Damnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which
Arguments, though they be of <hi>no value,</hi> and no way proving
that for which they are brought, yet Satan <hi>injecting ſuſpitions,</hi>
and their own Conſciences in the mean time juſtly accuſing, they
ſo ſink under their fear, that they ſuffer Satan to make <hi>what
concluſion</hi> he will, and then they <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> to it. 4. Above all,
<hi>Melancholy</hi> Perſons give the Devil the <hi>greateſt</hi> advantage to raiſe
affrightments. That Diſtemper naturally fills Men with ſad
thoughts, and is credulous of the worſt evil that can be objected
againſt him that hath it. Of it ſelf, it can create the blackeſt
Conceits, and ſaddeſt Surmiſes, and then believes its own fancy.
When Satan ſtrikes in with this Humour,<note place="margin">Finguntque, creduntque.</note> they are the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in their Suſpitions, and the Fright is the greater, becauſe
they are as <hi>Incredulous</hi> of what is good (if it be told them) as
they are apt to <hi>believe</hi> what is evil,<note place="margin">Dum timel, cred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t.</note> and to believe it, becauſe <hi>they
fear</hi> it; though no other reaſon were offered: But much more
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:49412:173"/>
when Satan in a <hi>Prophetick</hi> manner foretels their miſery, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
them they muſt never be happy.</p>
                     <p>3. The ſuſpitions which the Devil hath by theſe advantages
<hi>raiſed up,</hi> he doth endeavour to <hi>increaſe,</hi> and to root them <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
in the minds of them, upon whom he hath thus begun:
And indeed, by frequent <hi>inculcating</hi> the ſame thing with his
continued <hi>peremptorineſs</hi> of aſſerting the certainty of their
Non-election, he at laſt brings up very many to a <hi>full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion</hi>
that it is ſo; and beſides other Arts that he may have, or
exerciſe in this particular, he commonly practiſeth upon Men,
by <hi>perverting</hi> the true <hi>Intendment</hi> and uſe of the Doctrine of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
That there is ſuch a thing as <hi>Election,</hi> and that of a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate</hi>
number, are Truths undeniable; and the end of their
diſcovery in the Goſpel, is the <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>confirmation</hi> of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.
Here they may ſee Gods <hi>unchangeable love</hi> to them, how
much they <hi>ſtand engaged</hi> for the freeneſs of Grace, and that <hi>the
Foundation of God is ſure,</hi> &amp;c. For to this purpoſe doth our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
improve theſe Doctrines, <hi>John</hi> 17. 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 16. But
nothing of this is ſpoken to <hi>diſcourage</hi> any Man from his <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi>
neither can any Man, <hi>prove that he, or any other, is excluded
out of the decree of Election,</hi> (except in caſe of the ſin againſt the
Holy Ghoſt); neither is it poſſible for the <hi>Devil</hi> to <hi>prove</hi> any ſuch
thing againſt any Man; neither <hi>ought any to ſuppoſe himſelf not
Elect:</hi> But on the contrary, if he is <hi>willing to forſake ſin,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to be reconciled to God,</hi> he ought to apprehend a <hi>probability,</hi>
that he is Elected, becauſe the proffer of Chriſt is made <hi>to all that
will recieve him.</hi> And therefore ſhould Men <hi>ſtop</hi> their ears againſt
ſuch Suggeſtions, and not diſpute that with Satan, but rather
<hi>hearken</hi> to the Commands, Exhortations, and Promiſes of
Scripture, it being moſt certain that theſe <hi>ſecret things belong to
God,</hi> Deut. 29. 29. and are no Mans <hi>rule</hi> to walk by, ſeeing <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
things only belong to us.</hi> All this the Devil perverts, for he
endeavours to make Election the <hi>immediate Object</hi> of our Faith,
and <hi>our Rule</hi> to walk by; as if it were neceſſary that every Man
<hi>knew Gods eternal purpoſe</hi> concerning him, before <hi>he begin</hi> his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
And as he argues ſome Men into a <hi>perverſe careleſsneſs</hi>
upon the ground of Election, making them to conclude, that <hi>If
they are ordained to Life, they ſhall be ſaved, though they live wickedly;
if they be not, they ſhall be damned, though they endeavour never ſo
much to the contrary.</hi> So he alſo argues ſome, from this Doctrine,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:49412:174"/>
into terrible <hi>fears of Damnation,</hi> becauſe they cannot be aſſured
<hi>aforehand, that their names are written in Heaven.</hi> And theſe
dreadful ſuſpitions he doth labour to ſtrengthen, by ſome Mens
<hi>unwary</hi> handling of the Doctrine of Non-election; when ſome
Preachers unskilfully urge the <hi>dangerous ſigns</hi> of Reprobation, or
ſpeak <hi>ſeverely</hi> of God's Decrees, without due <hi>caution</hi> and <hi>promiſe</hi>
of Mercy to all penitent Sinners. Or when ſome, unskilful in
the methods of comforting the diſtreſſed in Conſcience, becauſe
they are not able to ſhew the Afflicted their Condition, or to
ſpeak <hi>a word in ſeaſon</hi> to quiet their Minds, and to <hi>direct</hi> them
what courſe to take, do uſually refer them to God's Decree, and
tell them, If God have <hi>decreed</hi> them to Salvation, they <hi>ſhall be
ſaved.</hi> Satan doth induſtriouſly hold them there, by this means
he leads them from the Promiſes and their Duty, and keeps them
<hi>muſing</hi> and <hi>poring</hi> upon Election, till they are <hi>bewildred,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find the way out. Thus have ſeveral continued under their
Affrightments for many Years.</p>
                     <p>4. We may obſerve, That when Satan hath brought them
into this ſnare, he doth <hi>tyrannically domineer</hi> over them. He doth
<hi>deride</hi> them under their trouble, and <hi>mock</hi> at them when <hi>their fear
comes</hi> upon them. And becauſe now the very thought, or hearing
of <hi>Election</hi> is as a Daggar to the heart, and a <hi>dreadful ſound in their
Ears,</hi> he delights to <hi>repeat</hi> it to them; for the very naming of the
word, becomes as dreadful, as the ſentence of <hi>Condemnation</hi> to
a Malefactor, being always accompanied with this Reflection;
<hi>Oh how miſerable am I, that have no part nor portion in it!</hi> Beſides,
he doth buſie their minds with <hi>imaginary repreſentations</hi> of Hell,
and ſets before them as in <hi>a Scheme,</hi> the day of Judgment, the
terrours of the Damned, the ſentence againſt the Goats on the
Left-hand, the intollerable pains of everlaſting Burnings, and
(that which is the miſery of all theſe Miſeries) the <hi>Eternity</hi> of
all. Thus he forceth their Meditations, but ſtill with Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to themſelves; neither doth he ſuffer them to reſt in the
Night, but they are terrified with ſad <hi>Dreams,</hi> and the <hi>Viſions of
the Night</hi> do diſquiet them.</p>
                     <p>5. How <hi>grievous</hi> this Affrightment is, I ſhould next obſerve,
but that is partly expreſſed in the aforegoing Particulars, and
may yet more fully appear by a conſideration of theſe 3 things.
1. That a Man hath nothing <hi>dearer</hi> to him than his Soul: Alas,
that cannot be counterballanced by the gaining of the whole
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:49412:174"/>
World, and to have <hi>no hope</hi> or expectancy of its Salvation, muſt
needs be terribly affrightful. 2. Theſe ſuſpitions of Non-electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
prevailing, all <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Comforts</hi> are urged in vain, and
they commonly return them back again to thoſe that offered them,
with this reply: <hi>They are true, and uſeful to thoſe unto whom they
appertain, but they belong not unto me.</hi> Nay, all means are rejected
as uſeleſs. If ſuch be adviſed to Pray, or Read, they will in their
fit of Affrightment <hi>refuſe</hi> all; upon this reaſon, that <hi>they are not
Elected.</hi> And then to what purpoſe (ſay they) is Prayer, or any
endeavours? <hi>For who can alter his Decree?</hi> And indeed, if their
Affrightments <hi>continued</hi> at an height without intermiſſion, they
would never do any thing; but this is their help, that ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<hi>under-ground hopes</hi> which they eſpy not, do revive at leaſt
ſometimes, and put them upon endeavours, which (through
Gods bleſſing) become means of better information. 3. Though
Satans injections of Non-election be altogether unproveable,
and withal ſo terrifying, that it might be ſuppoſed Men ſhould
not be forward in their belief of ſo great an unhappineſs: Yet
can he prevail ſo far, that the Perſons above named (eſpecially
the Melancholy) are made to believe him, and this chiefly by
poſſeſſing their imaginations, with his <hi>frequent confident</hi> Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Wee ſee it is a common practice to teach Birds Muſical
Notes and Sounds, which is only by conſtant repetition, till a
ſtrong Impreſſion is made upon their Fancy: And thus may one
Man impoſe upon the imagination of another with his Songs, or
Sayings: for what we hear often, we cannot forbear to repeat in
our thoughts, being ſtrongly fixed upon our Fancy. No wonder
then, if Satan by often repeating, <hi>Thou art not Elected, thou art
Damned,</hi> &amp;c. do form ſo ſtrong an impreſſion upon the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that poor amazed Creatures learn <hi>to ſay after him,</hi> and then
take the <hi>Ecchoes</hi> of their <hi>Fancy,</hi> to be the <hi>voice of Conſcience condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them.</hi> Now then, if the <hi>unhappineſs</hi> (ſuſpected) be the
<hi>greateſt</hi> beyond all compariſon, if theſe ſuſpitions entertained cut
off all <hi>ſuccours</hi> of Comfort that may ariſe from the Promiſes of
God, and the endeavours of Man, if Satan can prevail with Men
to entertain them with any <hi>perſwaſion</hi> (as we ſee he can) how
dreadfully will theſe perſwaſions recoil upon a Man? And thus
will his thoughts run, <hi>I am perſwaded I am not Elected; and if
not Elected, then Comforts and Prayers are all in vain; and if theſe be
in vain, there is no poſſibility of Salvation, nor the leaſt hope of a who
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:49412:175"/>
knows, or a peradventure; and if that, Oh unſpeakably miſerable?</hi>
Under theſe aſtoniſhing thoughts doth Satan exerciſe their hearts
by ſuſpitions of Non-election. But</p>
                     <p>4. Sometimes he takes another Courſe to affright Men, and
that is by injecting <hi>Motions</hi> of ſome <hi>abominable Sin,</hi> or evil into
their minds, to the commiſſion whereof he ſeems ſtrongly to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite;
yet not with any <hi>full</hi> intention, or <hi>expectation</hi> of preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
but with a purpoſe to <hi>moleſt</hi> and diſquiet. And for that
end, he commonly chuſeth ſuch ſins as are <hi>moſt vile</hi> in their own
Nature, and <hi>moſt oppoſite</hi> to the Diſpoſitions of Men: Thus he
injects thoughts of Uncleanneſs to a chaſt Perſon; thoughts of
injuſtice and wrong to a Juſt Man; thoughts of revenge and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
to a Week Man; thoughts of rejoycing in the loſs and miſery
of others to the Merciful Man. Or elſe he injects motions to
ſuch ſins, wherein formerly Men have been <hi>overtaken,</hi> but have
been made <hi>bitter</hi> by deep repentance; the very thoughts whereof
are now become moſt <hi>loathſome.</hi> And ſometimes he purſues Men
with thoughts of <hi>Self-Murther,</hi> even while there is <hi>nothing</hi> of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
or trouble in their Minds, to ſecond ſuch a Temptation.
By this manner of proceeding, he creates great Affrightments to
the Hearts of men. For</p>
                     <p>1. Theſe are ſtrange <hi>Surpriſals;</hi> and Perſons under this kind
of Trouble, cannot but be amazed to find ſuch thoughts within
them, which are moſt <hi>contrary</hi> to their Diſpoſitions, or their moſt
<hi>ſerious Reſolves.</hi> The chaſt Perſon tempted to Uncleanneſs, or
the juſt man to Revenge; the humble Perſon urged to the ſame
Sin that coſt him ſo dear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They <hi>wonder</hi> at their own Hearts,
and while they <hi>miſtake</hi> theſe Temptations, by judging them to
be the <hi>iſſues</hi> of their own <hi>Inclination,</hi> with aſtoniſhment they cry
out, <hi>Oh I had thought that I had mortified theſe Luſts, but what a
ſtrange Heart have I? I ſee ſin is a ſtrong in me as ever? And I have
cauſe to fear my ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. And this is yet a greater trouble, becauſe uſually Satan
takes them at <hi>ſome advantage</hi> of an offered occaſion, or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
then he gives them a ſudden puſh, and with importunity
urgeth them <hi>to take the time;</hi> this often affrights them into Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
and their Fears do ſo <hi>weaken</hi> their purpoſes, that their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
are the greater, in that they are aſtoniſhed into an <hi>Inactivity.</hi>
So that in this caſe, the Men of Might do not readily find their
Hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="327" facs="tcp:49412:175"/>
3. Neither are theſe motions <hi>ſudden</hi> and <hi>tranſient</hi> glances,
which periſh as ſoon as they are born, (though it be a very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
thing with Satan to caſt in motions into the Heart for trial
ſake, without further proſecution) but he (in this caſe) pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues
with frequent <hi>Repetitions,</hi> following hard after them, to the
increaſe of the Affrightment. So that for a long time together
Men may be afflicted with theſe Meſſengers of Satan to buffet
them; and though they may Pray earneſtly againſt them that
they may be removed, yet they find the motions continue upon
them. Which muſt needs be an <hi>hateful annoyance</hi> to an upright
Heart, that doth <hi>know</hi> it to be only Satans deſign to affright, much
more muſt it afflict thoſe that do <hi>not perceive</hi> the Contriver and
end of ſuch motions, but judg them to be the natural workings
of their own evil Heart.</p>
                     <p>4. Satan can alſo affright Men by <hi>immediate impreſſions of Fear</hi>
upon their minds. He can do much with the imagination, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when Perſons are diſtempered with Melancholy; for ſuch
are naturally fearful, and any impreſſions upon them have the
deepeſt, moſt piercing operation. They are always framing to
themſelves diſmal things, and abound with black and dark Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits;
ſurmiſing ſtill the worſt, and always incredulous of what
is good. Hence it is that ſometimes Men are ſeized upon by Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and Trembling, when yet they cannot give any <hi>tollerable
account</hi> of a cauſe, or reaſon, why it ſhould be ſo with them.
And others are exceſſively aſtoniſhed with the ſhadows of their
own thoughts, upon the meaneſt pretences imaginable.</p>
                     <p>That this is the work of Satan, doth appear by unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
evidence. This was that <hi>evil Spirit</hi> which God ſent between
<hi>Abimelech,</hi> and the Men of <hi>Sechem, Judg.</hi> 9. 23. God permitted
Satan (for the Puniſhment of them both) to raiſe Fears and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
in the Heart of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> againſt the Men of <hi>Sechem,</hi> and
in the Hearts of the Men of <hi>Sechem</hi> againſt <hi>Abimelech.</hi> They
were mutually afraid of one another, and theſe Fears <hi>wrought ſo
far,</hi> that they were (for the prevention of a ſuppoſed danger)
engaged in <hi>Treacherous Conſpiracies,</hi> to the real Ruine of them both.
The <hi>evil Spirit that vexed Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 16. 14. was nothing elſe
but ſudden and vehement <hi>fits of Terrour,</hi> and inward fear which
the Devil raiſed by the working up of his Melancholy. For we
may obſerve theſe Fits were allayed by <hi>Muſick;</hi> and alſo we might
ſee by his diſpoſition <hi>out of his fits,</hi> and by his carriage <hi>in them,</hi>
                        <pb n="328" facs="tcp:49412:176"/>
that <hi>inward fears</hi> were his <hi>tormentors:</hi> for 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 9. 'tis noted,
that <hi>Saul eyed David,</hi> that is, his jealous fears began to work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>David,</hi> of whom 'tis ſaid expreſly, ver. 12. <hi>that he was
afraid becauſe the Lord was with him;</hi> and when the evil Spirit came
upon him, his heart was exerciſed with theſe fears, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
he behaved himſelf when he caſt the Javelin at <hi>David</hi> with
a purpoſe to ſlay him. Upon any occaſion, of trouble eſpecially,
the Devil was at hand to heighten his affrightment, inſomuch
that when the ſuppoſed <hi>Samuel</hi> told him of his Death, 1 <hi>Sam. 28.
20.</hi> he was afraid to ſuch an height, that <hi>he fell ſtraightway all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
on the Earth and there was no ſtrength in him.</hi> Neither muſt we
ſuppoſe that Satan in this kind of working, is confined only to
wicked Men: for there is nothing in this manner of affrightment,
which is inconſiſtent with the condition of a Child of God, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
when God gives him up to tryal, or correction. Nay,
many of Gods Servants ſuffer under Satans hand in this very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Let us conſider the troubles of <hi>Job,</hi> and we ſhall find that
though Satan endeavoured to deſtroy his peace by diſcompoſure
of Spirit, by queſtioning his integrity, by frightful injections of
blaſphemous thoughts, yet all theſe he vanquiſhed with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
courage, the Blaſphemy he rejected with abhorrency, his
integrity he reſolved he would not deny ſo long as he lived, his
loſſes he digeſted eaſily with a ſober compoſed mind, bleſſed God
that gives and takes at pleaſure, and yet he complains of his fears,
and his frequent ſurpriſals thereby, inſomuch that his friends take
notice that moſt of his trouble aroſe from thence; Job 22. 10. <hi>a
ſudden fear troubleth thee,</hi> and he himſelf confeſſeth as much, Job 9.
34. <hi>let not his fear terrify me,—but it is not ſo with me.</hi> So that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that <hi>Job</hi>'s inward diſtreſs, was moſtly from ſtrong impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of affrighting fears.</p>
                     <p>Theſe fears impreſſed upon the Mind, muſt needs be an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible
trouble, there is nothing that doth more looſen the Sinews
and Joynts of the Soul, to the weakening and utter enfeebling
of it in all its endeavours, than fears; it ſcatters the ſtrength in a
moment. And beſides the preſent burthen, which will bow down
the backs of the ſtrongeſt, theſe fears have a ſpecial kind of <hi>envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
magnanimity</hi> in them: For 1. they come by fits, and have
times of more fierce and <hi>cruel aſſaults,</hi> yet in their intervals they
leave the Heart in a <hi>trembling fainting</hi> poſture, (for the Devil gives
not over the preſent ſit, till he hath <hi>rent</hi> them ſore, and left them
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49412:176"/>
(as he did the Mans Son in <hi>Mark 9. 26.) as one dead):</hi> So that 'tis
no more to be reckoned compaſſion, and gentleneſs in Satan to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the afflicted that their fits are not <hi>conſtant,</hi> than it can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
tenderneſs or kindneſs in a Tyrant, who when he hath
racked or tormented a Man as much as ſtrength will bear without
killing out of hand, gives over for a time, that the party might
be reſerved for <hi>new torments.</hi> 2. Theſe fits uſually return at <hi>ſuch</hi>
times as the Party afflicted ſeems to promiſe himſelf ſome <hi>little
eaſe,</hi> being deſigned to give the greater diſappointment, in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
his expected comforts. <hi>Sleep</hi> and <hi>Meat</hi> are the two great
refreſhments of the diſtreſſed, theſe times Satan watcheth for his
new onſets. <hi>Job</hi> found it ſo in both caſes, his Meal-times were
times of trouble; Job 3. 24. <hi>My ſighing cometh</hi> (that is the fits of
ſighing return) <hi>before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the
Waters;</hi> and his Sleeping times were no better, Job 7. 13. <hi>When I
ſay my Bed ſhall comfort me, my Couch ſhall eaſe my complaint: then
thou ſcareſt me with Dreams, and terrifieſt me through Viſions, ſo that
my Soul chuſeth ſtrangling and Death, rather than Life.</hi>—3. Theſe
fears do make them feel the weight, not only of <hi>real</hi> preſent evils,
but of all others which the <hi>imagination</hi> can repreſent to them. So
that the ſight or hearing of any ſad thing, afflicts them with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
that this will be their caſe. Hence are they full of miſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thoughts; ſometimes they fear that they ſhall at laſt fall off
from God, into ſome ſcandalous Sin, to the diſhonour of God
and Religion, as that they ſhall be Apoſtates, and turn openly
prophane, ſome times they fear they ſhall meet with ſome ſignal
devouring Judgment, by which they ſhall one day periſh; as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
ſaid in the like caſe, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of Saul:</hi>
thus are they crucified betwixt their preſent burthen, and future
expectations of evil.</p>
                     <p>6. The laſt (and indeed the meaneſt) Engine for the working
of affrightment, is <hi>ſcrupuloſity of Conſcience.</hi> Satan vexeth the
Conſcience and diſtracteth the Mind, by raiſing up <hi>needleſs, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi>
fears concerning a Mans Practice. Where the <hi>ignorance</hi> of Men,
or their <hi>timerous</hi> diſpoſitions do encourage Satan to this enterprize,
there he multiplies ſcruples upon them, ſo that though they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the doing of any thing as good or lawful, yet are they
conſtantly affrighted from it, by a ſuſpitious fear that it may be
otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>This kind of trouble takes in almoſt all kind of actions, it
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:49412:177"/>
extends to the way of a Mans <hi>Calling,</hi> the way of his management
of it, the rates he takes, and the prices he gives for his Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
our every <hi>natural</hi> actions of Sleeping, Eating, Drinking,
Company, Recreation, are not unconcerned. In all which the
Devil affrights the timerous Conſcience that (it may be) he hath
offended: if he buys or ſells, he is diſquieted with <hi>[a may be]</hi>
that he hath ſold too dear, or bought too cheap; if he eats or ſleeps,
he fears he hath been exceſſive, a Sluggard or a Glutton: thus
are ſome Men moleſted in every thing they do.</p>
                     <p>Neither is this kind of affrightment to be deſpiſed: for though
often 'tis a groundleſs fear, and ſo appears to be to diſcerning
Chriſtians; yet thoſe that are under this moleſtation think it bad
enough: Though it be not as a <hi>Rack</hi> that afflicts with violent pains,
yet 'tis as thoſe kinds of <hi>puniſhments</hi> which at firſt are nothing, but
by continuance do tire Men out with <hi>little-eaſe,</hi> and ſo at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
intollerable. Beſides this is a <hi>multiplying</hi> trouble; for one
ſcruple begets another, and by <hi>continuance</hi> of ſcrupling, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
grows <hi>ſo weak</hi> and unſteady, that <hi>every</hi> thing is ſcrupled,
and the Man brought to a continual affrightment of doing wrong
in every action. Neither can all Men make uſe of the <hi>remedy</hi> that
is preſcribed for the cure of this Diſtemper, which is, That when
ſuch ſcruples cannot be removed by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> then either Men
ſhould forbear the <hi>thinking</hi> upon ſuch things from whence ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are apt to ariſe, or they ſhould <hi>break</hi> them down by violence,
and go over the Belly of their ſcruple to the performance of their
action. I deny not but that ſomething may be done and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
this way; But any may ſee that 'tis not eaſy for every one
to do either of theſe: ſo that this is alſo a troubleſome evil, from
which 'tis not eaſy to be diſcharged.</p>

                     <p>BEſides the troubles already mentioned under the heads of <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſures</hi>
of Spirit, and <hi>affrightments,</hi> there is a third kind
of trouble which Satan gives to the Children of God, and this may
for diſtinction ſake, be called <hi>Spiritual Sadneſs.</hi> Theſe Spiritual
Sadneſſes <hi>are troubles raiſed in the Mind, relating to the Conſcience,
and Spiritual State or Condition of Men.</hi> They differ exceedingly
from the two former ſorts of trouble: for, 1. Theſe troubles
wholly concern the Conſcience in point of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and Men's
<hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> thereunto; whereas ſimple diſcompoſures of Spirit
firſtly relate to <hi>outward</hi> things. 2. In theſe the Conſcience is
<hi>immediately</hi> concerned, but in other troubles, the Conſcience is
either wholly <hi>untouched,</hi> or wounded only <hi>ſecondarily,</hi> by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
and progreſs of the diſcompoſure of the Spirit. 3. In
theſe troubles, Conſcience is the great <hi>inſtrument</hi> by which the
Devil works, whereas in the trouble of affrightments the Devil
acted <hi>alone,</hi> the Heart being in the mean time, <hi>uncomplyant</hi> and
reſiſting. For the opening of this trouble, I ſhall explain,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="332" facs="tcp:49412:178"/>
The ſeveral <hi>degrees</hi> thereof. 'Tis a trouble of Conſcience unduly
aggravated by Satan, wherein he confines himſelf to the <hi>operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of Conſcience. But then, as he ſuggeſts the troubles of Men
by the <hi>voice</hi> of Conſcience, ſo he doth all he can to make it <hi>irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
in its actings, and <hi>exceſſive</hi> in that irregularity. So that in this
caſe, the Conſcience is <hi>evil,</hi> and imploys it ſelf in that miſtake,
to enquire into Mens Regeneracy or Holineſs, always being either
a <hi>Neuter,</hi> or an <hi>Adverſary,</hi> and the Devil helps this forward all he
can.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. makes mention of an <hi>evil Conſcience,</hi>
and that chiefly as it doth occaſion fear, hindering our comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
acceſs to God. This the Conſcience doth when it doth not
execute its office aright, either in <hi>not excuſing</hi> when it ought, or
in <hi>accuſing</hi> when it ſhould not; and theſe falſe accuſations cauſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
ſorts of troubles according to the variety of the matter for
which it doth condemn. Hence is it that there are <hi>three degrees</hi> of
trouble of Conſcience, below the trouble of diſpair:</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>loweſt</hi> degree is when a regenerate Perſon doth not <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively</hi>
determine the caſe of his Soul, whether he be Regenerate
or not, but is only kept in <hi>ſuſpence</hi> betwixt Hope that he is, and
Fear that he is not, the Conſcience in the mean time forbearing
to witneſs for him, though it have juſt cauſe to excuſe him: This
we may call a <hi>doubting</hi> or queſtioning Conſcience; and though it
comes far ſhort of theſe diſtreſſes in which ſome Men are plunged
upon the account of their Souls, yet is it a trouble, for their Peace
is hereby hindred, and their deſires of ſatisfaction fruſtrated,
which in matters of ſo great concern (as are theſe of Everlaſting
Life, and Everlaſting Miſery) muſt be very diſquieting. When
the Affections are earneſt, their ſatisfaction cannot be delayed
without trouble; for <hi>Hope deferred makes the Heart ſick,</hi> Prov. 13. 12.
not only doth it <hi>faint</hi> under its doubts, but is by that means ſo
<hi>weak</hi> in its Purpoſes that it is eaſily drawn to admit of greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies,
which may lay the foundation of more perplexing
diſturbances.</p>
                     <p>That the Conſcience may be in ſuch a Diſtemper, that it will
not witneſs <hi>for a Man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ames Caſe Cenſe.</hi> lib. 1. c. 9</note> when yet it cannot witneſs <hi>againſt him,</hi> is
the obſervation of thoſe that have treated of the nature of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:
Sometimes it will not make <hi>application</hi> of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
though it will believe, that he that forſakes Sin is rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
that he that truly repents ſhall be pardoned, yet it will
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:49412:178"/>
not <hi>affirm</hi> for a Man, that he forſakes Sin or repents, though he
really do ſo; or if it cannot deny that, yet it will ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to make that concluſion which one would think would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of it ſelf, by natural conſequence, and ſo refuſeth to judge
the Perſon regenerate or pardoned, though it cannot deny but
that he forſakes Sin and repents. The <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the Bleſſing,
the <hi>remainders</hi> of Unbelief, the deep <hi>ſenſe</hi> of Unworthineſs, with
other conſiderations, do keep off the Heart from making (as I
may ſay) <hi>ſo bold</hi> with the Promiſes; but all this while the Devil
is doing his utmoſt to aggravate theſe conſiderations, afrighting
the Conſcience from that juſt abſolution which it ought to give.</p>
                     <p>2. Another degree of Trouble ariſing from an evil Conſcience,
is when the <hi>condition</hi> of a Regenerate Perſon is determined by
Conſcience (but falſly) to be <hi>very bad.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dickſon Therap. Sacra. <hi>lib. 3. c.</hi> 1.</note> I muſt here (as ſome
others have done) for want of better terms diſtinguiſh betwixt
the <hi>ſtate</hi> of Regeneracy, and a Mans <hi>condition</hi> in that ſtate, though
the words <hi>[ſtate and condition]</hi> are uſed promiſcuouſly the one for
another. A Man may be in a <hi>Regenerate ſtate,</hi> and yet his condition
in <hi>that ſtate</hi> may be very bad and blame-worthy, as not walking
worthy of ſo holy a Calling; as a Perſon may be a Man, and yet
unhealthy or languiſhing. Thus many of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches
were <hi>true</hi> Churches, and yet in a <hi>bad</hi> condition; ſome <hi>lukewarm;</hi>
ſome <hi>had a name to live, and yet were</hi> comparatively <hi>dead,</hi> becauſe
<hi>their works</hi> were not full or <hi>perfect before God;</hi> and others had <hi>left
their firſt</hi> love. To this purpoſe is that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5.
Know ye not your own ſelves,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> 
                        <hi>how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except
ye be Reproabates?</hi> where the word <hi>Reprobate</hi> is not to be taken in
the ſtrict ſevere ſenſe for one <hi>not elected,</hi> but for one whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
is not <hi>ſo ſound</hi> and approved as it ſhould be: for this
relates not to their <hi>being in Chriſt,</hi> but to their <hi>aſſurance</hi> of being
in that ſtate, which the Apoſtle affirms they might know, except
the fault lay in their negligent careleſs converſation.</p>
                     <p>This kind of Trouble then is of this nature: the Conſcience
doth not accuſe a Man to be <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate,</hi> yet it condemns him
for a carriage <hi>unſuitable</hi> to the Goſpel; and this ſometimes when
his Actions are not <hi>abſolutely</hi> evil, but partly good, partly bad:
When the Conſcience condemns the Actions as altogether ſinful,
becauſe of ſome <hi>mixture</hi> of Infirmities, in which caſe we ſhould
imitate the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. who when by reaſon of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of Sin in him, he <hi>could not</hi> do the good <hi>he would,</hi> that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:49412:179"/>
is in <hi>ſuch a manner</hi> and degree as he deſired, nor <hi>avoid</hi> the evil
which he would ſo <hi>clearly</hi> and fully as he wiſhed, ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in his beſt endeavours ſtill cleaving to him: yet his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
took a right courſe, he was humbled for his imperfections,
but withal acquits himſelf in point of integrity, his Conſcience
teſtified, ver. 16. that he <hi>conſented to the Law as good,</hi> and ver. 22.
that he <hi>delighted in the Law of God after the inward Man.</hi> But in
this caſe of Spiritual trouble, the Conſcience takes all in the worſt
ſence, it only fixeth upon the <hi>imperfections,</hi> and makes them to
ſerve for proofs againſt the Sincerity. Thus if a Man in praying
be troubled with <hi>wandering</hi> thoughts, then a diſtempered Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
condemns that Prayer as a ſinful prophanation of the name
of God: if the great concern of <hi>God's Glory</hi> run along in ſuch a
way, as is alſo advantagious to the <hi>Perſon</hi> in outward things, then
will ſuch a Conſcience condemn the Man for <hi>ſelf-ſeeking,</hi> though
his <hi>main deſign</hi> were truly the honour of God. In all actions where
there is <hi>infirmity</hi> appearing with the moſt <hi>ſerious</hi> endeavours, or
where <hi>God's Glory</hi> and <hi>Man's Good</hi> are twiſted together, the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Conſcience will be apt to take part with Satan, accuſing
and condemning the action. Yea very often when the actions
are <hi>very good,</hi> no way juſtly reprovable, the Conſcience ſhall
condemn: if he have had peace, he ſhall be judged for ſecurity; if
he have Faith in God's promiſes, it will call it preſumption; if he
have a zeal for God, it will be miſinterpreted for carnal rigour; if
he have joy, it ſhall be misjudged to be natural chearfulneſs, or
deluſion; in a word, all his <hi>Graces</hi> ſhall be eſteemed no better than
<hi>moral Vertues.</hi> At this rate are the Children of God put to great
trouble, <hi>loſing</hi> (as I may ſay) <hi>the things they have wrought,</hi> ſadly
bemoaning their hardneſs of heart, or want of Faith and Love,
when in their carriage and complainings, they give very <hi>high proofs</hi>
of all. In this alſo Satan is buſy to nouriſh the Conſcience in its
Jealouſies, and doth ſuggeſt many objections to confirm it in its
Diſtemper. The Conſcience is not always of a peeviſh or perverſe
humour; for ſometimes it will ſmite a Man for a miſcarriage (as
it did to <hi>David</hi> when he cut off the lap of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Garment) and
yet not break his peace: which is a ſufficient evidence that it is
put (in this caſe) far out of order; which advantage Satan
works upon to diſquiet the heart, to make Men unthankful for
the Mercies they have received, and to incapacitate them for more.
This for diſtinction ſake, we may call the trouble of <hi>a grieved or
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:49412:179"/>
dejected</hi> Conſcience, according to that of Pſal. 42. 5, 11. <hi>Why art
thou caſt down, O my Soul? and why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi>
Though ſuch Men are under God's Favour, yet they misdeem it,
and think God is angry with them, their Heart pants, their Soul
thirſts, their Tears are their Meat, they are ready to ſay unto God,
<hi>My rock, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And though they have ſome
hopes for the future, that God <hi>will command his loving kindneſs,</hi> and
that they <hi>ſhall yet praiſe him;</hi> yet their preſent apprehenſion of
their Spiritual wants and weakneſſes, and of the diſpleaſure of
God, which they ſuppoſe they are under, makes them go mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Day.</p>
                     <p>3. The third degree of trouble of Conſcience is when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
peremptorily denies the <hi>ſtate of Regeneration.</hi> Hereby a Man
that is really regenerate, is concluded to be yet <hi>in the Gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and bond of Iniquity;</hi> his former hopes are taxed for <hi>ſelf-deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and his preſent ſtate to be a ſtate of Nature. This trouble is
far greater than the two former; becauſe the Party is judged to be
in <hi>greater hazard,</hi> and by many degrees more remote <hi>from hope.</hi>
'Tis the frequent and ſad thought of ſuch, That if Death ſhould
in that eſtate cut off their days, Oh! then they were for ever mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.
The fears and diſquiets of the Heart on this account,
are very grievous, but yet they admit of <hi>degrees,</hi> according to the
<hi>Ignorance</hi> of the Party, the <hi>Diſtemper</hi> of the Conſcience, the <hi>Strength</hi>
of the Objections, or <hi>Severity</hi> of the Proſecution, in regard the
Conſcience is now ſadly out of order. We may call this degree
of grief (for diſtinction) <hi>a wounded Spirit;</hi> which how hard it is
to be born <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 14. By comparing it with
all other kind of troubles, which the <hi>Spirit of a Man</hi> can make
ſome ſhift to <hi>bear,</hi> making this heavier than all, and above ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Some make <hi>enquiry</hi> what may be the difference betwixt a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Spirit, in the <hi>Regenerate</hi> and the <hi>Reprobate?</hi> To which it may be
<hi>anſwered,</hi> 1. That in the Parties apprehenſion there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at all: both of them may be compaſſed about with the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
of Death,</hi> and ſuppoſe themſelves to be in the <hi>Belly of Hell.</hi>
2. Neither is there any difference in the <hi>degree</hi> of the trouble, a
Child of God may be handled with as much ſeeming <hi>Severity,</hi> as
he whom God intends for a future <hi>Tophet.</hi> 3. Neither is there
any ſuch remarkable difference in the <hi>working</hi> of the Spirits of the
one and other, that <hi>they</hi> themſelves at preſent, or <hi>others</hi> that are
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:49412:180"/>
by-ſtanders, can <hi>eaſily</hi> obſerve. Yet a formal difference there is,
for Grace being in the Heart of the one, will in ſome <hi>breathing</hi> or
<hi>Pulſe</hi> diſcover its Life. And though ſometimes it acts ſo low, or
confuſedly, that <hi>God only</hi> can diſtinguiſh; yet often thoſe that are
<hi>experienced</hi> obſerves will diſcover ſome real Breathings after God,
and true loathing of Sin, and other traces of Faith and Love,
that are not ſo diſcernible to the Parties themſelves. 4. But in
God's <hi>deſign</hi> the difference is very great: the wicked lye under his
Laſh as <hi>Malefactors,</hi> but the regenerate are as Patients <hi>under Cure,</hi>
or Children <hi>under Diſcipline.</hi> 5. And accordingly the <hi>Iſſue</hi> doth
determine, that Gods intention in wounding their Spirits were
not alike to both; the one at laſt, coming out of the Furnace as
<hi>Gold,</hi> the other ſtill remaining as <hi>reprobate Silver,</hi> or being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
as droſs. Thus have ye ſeen the nature and degree of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Sadneſs.</p>
                     <p>2. For the further explanation whereof I ſhall next ſhew you
that this is an <hi>uſual</hi> trouble to the Children of God.</p>
                     <p>Which, 1. I might evidence from ſeveral <hi>Inſtances</hi> of thoſe that
have ſuffered much under it: as <hi>David,</hi> whoſe complaints in this
caſe are very frequent; and <hi>Heman,</hi> who left a memorial of his
griefs in <hi>Pſal. 88. Jonah</hi> alſo in the Belly of the Whale, had a ſharp
fit of it, when he concluded that he was <hi>caſt out of Gods Sight,</hi> and
his <hi>Soul fainted</hi> within him, <hi>Jon.</hi> 2. 4. 7. Neither did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
eſcape it, for though his diſquiet began upon another
ground, it run him into Spiritual trouble at laſt. But beſides theſe,
innumerable inſtances occur. One ſhall ſcarce converſe with any
Society of Chriſtians, but he ſhall meet with ſome, who with ſad
complaints ſhall bemoan the burthen of their Hearts, and the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of their Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>proviſions</hi> which God hath made in his Word for ſuch,
is an evidence that ſuch Diſtempers are <hi>frequent.</hi> He that in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhall obſerve the Shops of the Apothecaries, and there take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the great variety of Medicines, Pots and Glaſſes full of
Mixtures, Confection and Cordials: may from thence rationally
conclude, that 'tis a frequent thing for Men to be Sick, though he
ſhould not converſe with any Sick Perſon for his information.
Thus may we be ſatisfied from the Declarations, Directions, and
Conſolations of Scripture, that 'tis a common caſe for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God to ſtand in need of Spiritual Phyſitians, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Remedies to help them, when they are wounded and fainting.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:49412:180"/>
                        <hi>Solomon</hi>'s exclamination, <hi>a wounded Spirit who can bare?</hi> ſhews that
the Spirit is ſometimes wounded. The Prophets direction, <hi>he that
walks in darkneſs and ſees no Light, let him truſt in the Lord,</hi> clearly
implies that ſome there are that walk in darkneſs. God's creating
the <hi>fruit of the Lips, Peace, peace;</hi> his promiſes of reſtoring <hi>Comforts
to Mourners;</hi> his commands to others to comfort them; do all
inform us, that 'tis a common things for his Children to be under
ſuch Sadneſſes of Spirit, that all this is neceſſary for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>reaſons</hi> of this trouble, do alſo aſſure us of the frequency
of it: for of them we may ſay (as Chriſt ſpeaks of the poor) <hi>we
have them always with us;</hi> ſo that the grounds of Spiritual Sadneſs
conſidered, 'tis no wonder to find many Men complaining under
this Diſtemper. The reaſons are,</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>Malice</hi> of Satan, who hath no greater revenge againſt a
Child of God, when tranſlated from the Power of Darkneſs to the
Kingdom of Chriſt, than to hinder him of the Peace and Comfort
of that condition.</p>
                     <p>2. The many <hi>advantages</hi> which Satan hath againſt us. For the
effecting of this, we cannot imagine that one ſo malicious as he is,
will ſuffer his Malice to ſleep, when ſo many fair opportunities of
putting it in practice do offer themſelves. For 1. The <hi>Queſtions</hi>
to be determined for ſetling the peace of the Soul, are very <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate,</hi>
and often of greater difficulty than <hi>Doctrinal</hi> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.
How hard is it to conclude, what is the <hi>Minimum quod
ſic;</hi> the loweſt degrees of true Grace? Or the <hi>Maximum quod ſic;</hi>
the higheſt degree of ſin, conſiſtant with true Grace? To diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
betwixt a Child of God at the <hi>loweſt,</hi> and an Hypocrite, or
Temporary Believer at the <hi>higheſt,</hi> is difficult. In <hi>mixt</hi> actions,
to be able to ſhew how the Soul doth manage its reſpect <hi>to God,</hi>
when the Man hath alſo a reſpect to <hi>himſelf,</hi> eſpecially when it
is under any <hi>confuſion,</hi> is not eaſie. And in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſe Actions where
the difference from others of like kind, lies only in the <hi>grounds</hi>
and <hi>motives</hi> of the undertaking, or where the <hi>prevailing degree</hi> muſt
diſtinguiſh the Act, in reference to <hi>different</hi> Objects that are <hi>ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi>
to one another (as our loving God above the World, or

                        </gap> God above Men, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> 'tis not every one
that can give a ſatisfactory determination. 2. As the intricacies of
the Doubts to be reſolved, give the Devil an advantage to puzzle
us; ſo is the advantage heightned exceedingly by the great <hi>injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs,</hi>
                        <pb n="338" facs="tcp:49412:181"/>
and unskilfulneſs of the greateſt part of Chriſtians.
Theſe Queſtions are in their <hi>notion</hi> difficult, more difficult in their
<hi>application</hi> to particular Perſons, (where the ableſt Chriſtian may
eaſily be non-pluſt) but moſt difficult to the <hi>weak</hi> Chriſtians: Theſe
Satan can baffle with every poor Objection, and impoſe what
he will upon them. 3. Eſpecially having the advantage of the
working <hi>guilt</hi> of Conſcience, which he can readily ſtir up, to
preſent to a Mans <hi>remembrance</hi> all his failings and miſcarriages,
of what nature ſoever. And when Guilt rageth in an unskilful
Heart, it muſt needs create great diſquiet. 4. But moſt of all
when our <hi>natural fears are awakened:</hi> As when a Man hath been
under any great Conviction, though he be cured of his Trouble,
yet it uſually leaves a weakneſs in the part, (as Bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſes and Maims
do in any Member of the Body) which at the change of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or other accidental hurt, will renew their old Trouble;
and then, when freſh Guilt begins to preſs hard upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
not only do the broken Bones ake, by the <hi>reviving</hi> of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
fears: But the impreſſions of his old ſuſpitions, bad conceit
of himſelf, and jealouſies of the deceitfulneſs of his Heart,
which had then fixed themſelves by a deep rooting, do now
make him <hi>moſt fearful</hi> of entertaining any <hi>good thought</hi> of
himſelf. So that if any conſideration tending to his ſupport be
offered, he dare not come near it, ſuſpecting his greateſt danger
to lie <hi>on that hand.</hi> Theſe advantages conſidered, we ſhould not
think it ſtrange that any Child of God is driven to Spiritual Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
(as ſome do) but may rather wonder that this is not the
common condition of all Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>3. Another reaſon that muſt be aſſigned for theſe Troubles, is
<hi>Divine Diſpenſation;</hi> ſuch are his Children, ſome ſo Careleſs, others
Proud, others Stubborn, many Preſumptuous, that God is forced
to correct them by this piece of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and to cure them by
caſting them into a Feaver. Others of his Children he thus Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth
for <hi>other ends,</hi> ſometimes to take occaſion there-from, of
making larger <hi>diſcoveries</hi> of his Love; ſometimes thereby <hi>prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
them from falling under ſome grievous Miſcarriage, or for
the <hi>tryal</hi> and exerciſes of their Graces. We may obſerve accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
that there are <hi>three</hi> ſorts of Men that uſually have Exerciſes
of this kind.</p>
                     <p>1. Thoſe who at their Converſion, are either <hi>Ignorant, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,</hi>
or were <hi>groſly Scandalous,</hi> are uſually brought through with
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:49412:181"/>
great fear and ſadneſs. And this is ſo obſervable, that (by the
miſtake of Men) it is made a general Rule, that none are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
but they are under great and frightful apprehenſions of
Wrath, and diſmal Terrors. This indeed is true of ſome, but
theſe ordinarily are the Scandalous, Melancholy, and Ignorant
ſort, (though ſometimes God may deal ſo with others, for who
can limit him?) Yet are there many, whoſe Education hath
been good, and their Inſtruction aforehand great, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
is ſo <hi>gradual</hi> and inſenſible, that they are ſtrangers to theſe
troubles of Conſcience; and profeſs that if theſe <hi>heights</hi> of fear be
neceſſary to Converſion, they muſt be at a <hi>loſs,</hi> neither can they
give an account of the <hi>time</hi> of their Converſion as others may.</p>
                     <p>2. Thoſe whoſe Converſion was eaſie, when after their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
they <hi>miſcarry</hi> by any <hi>great</hi> Iniquity, they meet with as
great a meaſure of Terrour and Fear (and ſome think far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
as thoſe whoſe new Birth was more difficult. <hi>David</hi>'s great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
troubles of Soul came upon him after he began to appear
more publick in the World; for then he met with many <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and great <hi>Occaſions</hi> for God's exerciſing his Diſcipline over
him. I believe, when he kept his Fathers Sheep, his Songs had
<hi>more</hi> of Praiſes, and <hi>leſs</hi> of Complainings than afterward. It is
the Opinion of ſome, that God's dealing in this kind of Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
even when miſcarriage is not the cauſe, is more ſharp
uſually to thoſe, whoſe Converſion hath been moſt eaſie.</p>
                     <p>3. There is another ſort of Men, to whom God vouchſafes,
but <hi>ſeldom</hi> and <hi>ſhort</hi> fits of Spiritual Joy, as <hi>breathing times,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
ſharp fits of Soul-trouble, for neceſſary refreſhment and
recovery of ſtrength; but the <hi>conſtant courſe</hi> which God holds with
them, is to <hi>exerciſe</hi> them under fears while he hides his Face from
them, and ſuffers Satan to vex them, by urging his Objections
againſt their holineſs and integrity. <hi>Heman</hi> was one of this Rank,
and the <hi>great</hi> Inſtance which God hath given in his Word, for the
ſupport of others that may be in the ſame caſe. For he teſtifies
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. that he ſuffered the <hi>Terrours</hi> of God almoſt to <hi>deſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and this from <hi>his Youth up.</hi> 'Tis not fit for us too narrowly
to queſtion, why God doth thus to his Children, ſeeing his <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are unſearchable,</hi> and his <hi>ways paſt finding out;</hi> but we may
be ſute, that God ſees this dealing to be moſt fit for thoſe that are
exerciſed therewith; it may be, to keep Pride from them, or to
prevent them from falling into ſome greater inconvenience or
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:49412:182"/>
ſin: Unto which, he takes notice of a more than ordinary <hi>prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
in their diſpoſition, or for the benefit of others who may
thereby take notice, what <hi>an evil and bitter thing it is</hi> to ſin againſt
God, and what a malicious Adverſary they have to deal with.
Whoſo ſhall conſider theſe reaſons of Spiritual Sadneſs, muſt
needs confeſs, that (ſeeing the <hi>advantages</hi> which Men give to a
malicious Devil to vex their Conſciences are ſo many and great,
and the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of Gods Children ſo hazardous, for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof, a wiſe careful Father will neceſſarily be engaged
to exerciſe his Diſcipline) it cannot be expected, but that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Troubles ſhould be very frequent among the Servants of
God.</p>
                     <p>Here it is requiſite that I give ſatisfaction to this <hi>Quaery.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>God</hi> doth ſometime <hi>wound</hi> the Conſciences of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and that <hi>Satan</hi> alſo <hi>wounds</hi> them, what are the <hi>differences</hi>
betwixt God and Satan, in inflicting theſe Wounds?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the right underſtanding of this Queſtion, I ſhall
propound <hi>two</hi> things:</p>
                     <p>1. That it is a truth, that <hi>God</hi> doth ſometimes <hi>wound</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of his Children; and this, 1. <hi>Before</hi> Converſion: but in
<hi>order</hi> to it, as preparatory to that change, Men are then in their
ſins, walking in the vanity of their minds. To <hi>tranſlate</hi> them from
this eſtate, he awakens the Conſcience, ſhews them their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the danger of them, that at preſent they are <hi>in their
Blood, Children of wrath, as well as others,</hi> and that without
Chriſt they are miſerable; the effect of this muſt needs be <hi>ſerious</hi>
Conſideration, deep thoughts of Heart, with ſome <hi>trouble,</hi> only
as to the <hi>meaſure</hi> and degree there is great <hi>difference:</hi> God doth not
in the particular application of theſe things to the Conſcience, tie
up himſelf exactly to the ſame <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> of proceeding,
though he keep ſtill to his <hi>general Method.</hi> Hence is it, that ſome
(in regard of Gods gentle <hi>leaſurely</hi> dealing, and the frequent
<hi>interpoſure</hi> of Incouragements) are (if compared with the caſe
of others) ſaid to be <hi>allured,</hi> and <hi>drawn with Cords of Love:</hi>
But others have a remarkable meaſure of trouble, ſharp fits of
Fear and Anguiſh; and thoſe moſt commonly are ſuch, whoſe
Converſion is more <hi>quick,</hi> and the Change viſible from one <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream</hi>
to <hi>another,</hi> (as <hi>Paul,</hi> when Converted in the midſt of his
Perſecuting rage) or thoſe whoſe <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Melancholy,</hi> makes
their Hopes and Comforts inacceſſible for the preſent. Theſe
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:49412:182"/>
troubles God <hi>owns</hi> to be the Work of his Spirit: the ſame Spirit
which is a <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> to the Converted, is a <hi>Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi>
to theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. And accordingly we find, it was ſo
to the Converts, in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Who being <hi>pricked in their hearts</hi> by
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, <hi>cried out, Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi>
The like did the <hi>Jaylor.</hi> And the Promiſe which God makes of
calling the <hi>Jews, Zach.</hi> 12. 10. doth expreſs God's purpoſe of
dealing with them in this very Method; <hi>They ſhall look upon him
whom they have pierced, and ſhall mourn for him as one that mourneth
for his only Son, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him,—in that day ſhall
be a great mourning.</hi> 2. God alſo ſometimes wounds the Conſcience
of his Children <hi>after Converſion,</hi> and this he doth to convince and
humble them for ſome Miſcarriage, which they become guilty
of.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid. Goodwin</hi> Child of Light.</note> As when they grow <hi>ſecure,</hi> carnally confident of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of their Peace, when they are careleſly <hi>negligent</hi> of Duty,
and the exerciſes of their Graces, when they fall into <hi>groſs</hi> and
ſcandalous ſins, or wilfully <hi>deſert</hi> the ways of Truth; and in
many more caſes of like kind. When his Children make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
thus obnoxious to Divine Diſpleaſure, then God hides his
Face from them, takes away his Spirit, ſignifies his Anger to their
Conſciences, threatens them with the danger of that Condition;
from whence follows grief and fear in the Hearts of his People.
In this manner God expreſſed his Diſpleaſure to <hi>David,</hi> as his
Complaints in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. do teſtifie: <hi>Make me to hear joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that the Bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce, hide thy Face
from my ſins.—Caſt me not away from thy preſence, and take not thy
holy Spirit from me. Reſtore unto me the joy of thy Salvation,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. Notwithſtanding all this, there is a <hi>great difference</hi> betwixt
God and Satan in this matter, which mainly appears in <hi>two</hi>
things. 1. God doth <hi>limit</hi> himſelf in all the Trouble which he
gives his Children, to his great <hi>end</hi> of doing them Good, and
Healing them, and conſequently <hi>ſtints</hi> himſelf in the <hi>meaſure</hi> and
<hi>manner</hi> of his Work to ſuch a <hi>proportion,</hi> as his Wiſdom ſees will
exactly ſuit with his End. So that his Anger is not like the
<hi>brawlings</hi> of malicious Perſons that know <hi>no bounds;</hi> he will not <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Chide;</hi> his Debates are <hi>in meaſure,</hi> and this, <hi>leſt the Spirit ſhould
fail before him,</hi> Iſa. 57. 16. So that when he wounds the Conſcience
before Converſion, 'tis but to bring them to Chriſt, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their taking ſuch Courſes, as might through Deluſion, make
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:49412:183"/>
them take up their ſtand ſhort of him. So much of Mourning
and Fear as is requiſite for the true effecting of this, he appoints
for them, and no more. When he wounds after Converſion, 'tis
but to let them feel that it is an evil and bitter thing to ſin
againſt him, that their Godly <hi>ſorrow</hi> may work <hi>Repentance</hi> ſuitable
to the Offence; and that they may be ſufficiently cautioned for
the time to come, to <hi>ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing befal them.</hi> He
that afflicts not willingly, will put no more Grief upon them,
than is neceſſary to bring them to this. But Satan when he is
admitted (and God doth ofter permit him in ſubſervience to his
deſign) to wound the Conſcience, he proceeds according to the
<hi>boundleſs fury</hi> of his malice, and plainly manifeſts that his deſire
is to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> and to tread them down, that they may never riſe
again: This though he cannot effect, (for God will not ſuffer
him to proceed further, than the bringing about his holy and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Purpoſe) yet it hinders not, but that ſtill his envious
thoughts boil up in his Breaſt, and he acts according to his <hi>own
Inclination.</hi> For it is with Satan, as 'tis with wicked Men; if
God imploy them for the Chaſtiſement of his Children, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
not <hi>who</hi> ſets them on work, nor what <hi>Meaſures</hi> probably
God would have them obſerve; but they propoſe to themſelves
<hi>more work</hi> than ever God cut out for them. As <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> when
imployed againſt <hi>Jeruſalem, Iſa.</hi> 10. 7. had deſigns more large
and cruel than was in Gods Commiſſion. God had ſtinted him in
his holy Purpoſe; yet the <hi>Aſſyrian meant not ſo, neither did his heart
think ſo, but it was in his heart to deſtroy and cut off Nations not
a few.</hi> So that when God is <hi>a little diſpleaſed</hi> (as he ſpeaks,
<hi>Zach. 1. 15.)</hi> they do all that lies in them, to help forward the
Affliction. Thus doth the Devil endeavour to make all things
worſe to God's Children, than ever God intended. Here is one
difference betwixt God and Satan, in the wounding of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
But, 2. They are yet further differenced, in that all that
God doth in this Work, is ſtill <hi>according to Truth.</hi> For if he
ſignifie to the Unconverted that they are in a ſtate of Nature,
liable to the Damnation of Hell, unleſs they accept of Chriſt for
Salvation upon his Terms; this is no more than what is true,
God doth not <hi>miſrepreſent</hi> their Caſe to them at <hi>that</hi> time. Again,
if he expreſs his diſpleaſure to any of his Converted Children,
that have grieved his Spirit by their Follies, by ſetting before
them the Threatnings of his Word, or the Examples of his
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:49412:183"/>
Wrath; he doth but <hi>truly tell them</hi> that he is angry with them,
and that <hi>de jure,</hi> according to the <hi>Rigour</hi> of the Law, and the
<hi>demerit</hi> of their Offence, he might juſtly caſt them off: But he
doth not <hi>poſitively</hi> ſay, that <hi>de eventu,</hi> it ſhall infallibly be ſo with
them. But Satan in both theſe caſes, goes a great way <hi>further.</hi>
He plainly affirms to thoſe that are in the way to Converſion, that
God <hi>will not</hi> pardon their Iniquities, that there is <hi>no hope</hi> for
them, that Chriſt <hi>will not</hi> accept them; that he <hi>never intended</hi> the
benefit of his Sufferings for them. And when the Converted
do provoke God, he ſticks not to ſay, the Breach <hi>cannot</hi> be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that they <hi>are not</hi> yet Converted. All which are moſt <hi>falſe</hi>
aſſertions. And though God can <hi>make uſe</hi> of Satans malice, when
he abuſeth his Children with his <hi>falſhoods</hi> to their great fear, to
carry on his own ends by it, and to give a <hi>greater</hi> impreſſion to
what he <hi>truly</hi> witneſſeth againſt them: Yet is not God the <hi>proper
Author</hi> of Satans lying, for he doth it <hi>of his own</hi> wicked inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The <hi>effect</hi> of theſe deſperate falſe Concluſions (which is
the putting his Children into a fear, in order to his end) may
be aſcribed to God; but the <hi>falſhood</hi> of theſe Concluſions are <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi>
Satan's work, and not God's. For he makes uſe of ſo much
of Satan's <hi>wrath</hi> as may be to his <hi>Praiſe,</hi> and the <hi>remainder of</hi> his
<hi>wrath</hi> he doth <hi>reſtrain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have diſcovered the <hi>nature</hi> and degrees of theſe Spiritual
Troubles, and that 'tis a common thing for the Children of God
to fall under them. For the further opening of them, I ſhall
next diſcover.</p>
                     <p>3. The uſual <hi>ſolemn occaſions,</hi> that do as it were invite Satan,
to give his onſet againſt God's Children, and they are principally
theſe <hi>Six.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>time of Converſion:</hi> He delights to ſet on them when
they are in the ſtraits of a new Birth, for then the Conſcience is
<hi>awakned,</hi> the danger of Sin <hi>truly</hi> repreſented, <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>ſorrow</hi> (in
ſome degree) neceſſary and unavoidable. At this time he can
eaſily <hi>overdrive</hi> them. Where the Convictions are <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>ſharp,</hi>
ready to weigh them down, a <hi>few Grains</hi> more caſt into the Scale,
will make the Trouble (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>heavier than the Sand;</hi>
and where they are more eaſie, or gentle, yet the Soul being
<hi>unſetled,</hi> the thoughts in commotion, they are diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a <hi>ſtrong</hi> impreſſion, and to be turned <hi>(as Wax to the Seal)</hi>
into a mould of <hi>Hopeleſsneſs</hi> and Deſperation. That this is one of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:49412:184"/>
Satans ſpecial occaſions, we need no other evidence for ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than the common experience of Converts; many of them
do <hi>hardly eſcape</hi> the danger, and after their difficult Conqueſt of
the troubles of their Heart (which at that time are extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
enlarged) <hi>do witneſs,</hi> that they are aſſaulted with deſperate
fears, that their ſins were <hi>unpardonable,</hi> and ſad concluſions againſt
any <hi>expectation</hi> of favour from the Lord their God. Theſe
thoughts we are ſure, the Spirit of God <hi>will not</hi> bear witneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
becauſe <hi>falſe,</hi> and therefore we muſt leave them at Satans
door.</p>
                     <p>2. Another occaſion which Satan makes uſe of, is the time of
<hi>ſolemn Repentance</hi> for ſome <hi>great ſin</hi> committed <hi>after</hi> Converſion.
Sometimes God's Children fall, to the breaking of their Bones.
What great Iniquities they may commit through the force of
Temptation, I need not mention. The Adultery and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>David;</hi> the Inceſt of the <hi>Corinthian; Peters</hi> denial of Chriſt,
with other ſad Inſtances, in the Records of the Scriptures, do
ſpeak enough of that. Theſe ſins (conſidering their hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the ſcandal of Religion, the diſhonour of God, the grieving
of his Spirit, the condition of the Party offending againſt Love,
Knowledg and the various Helps which God affords them to
the contrary, with other aggravating Circumſtances) being very
diſpleaſing to God, their Conſciences at leaſt, (either <hi>compelled</hi>
to Examination <hi>by God immediately,</hi> or <hi>mediately</hi> by ſome great
<hi>Affliction,</hi> or <hi>voluntarily</hi> awakening to a ſerious conſideration of
what hath been done, by the working of its <hi>own Light,</hi> aſſiſted
thereunto by quickning Grace, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 31, 32.)</hi> call them to
a ſtrict account; thence follow <hi>Fear, Shame, Self-Indignation,
bitter Weeping, deep Humiliation;</hi> then comes Satan, he rakes their
Wounds, and by his Aggravations makes them ſmart the more: He
pours in <hi>Corroſives</hi> inſtead of Oyl, and all to make them believe, that
<hi>their Spot is not the Spot of Gods Children;</hi> that their Back-ſlidings
cannot be healed. An occaſion it is, as ſuitable to his Malice as
he could wiſh; for ordinarily God doth <hi>ſeverely</hi> teſtifie his Anger
to them, and doth not <hi>eaſily</hi> admit them again to the <hi>ſence</hi> of his
Favour. At which time, the Adverſary is very buſie to work up
their Hearts to an <hi>exceſs</hi> of Fear and Sorrow. This was the
courſe which he took with the Inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of his great Tranſgreſſions, to <hi>overwhelm him with too
much Sorrow,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 7, 11.</p>

3. Satan watcheth the <hi>diſcompoſures</hi> of the Spirits of God's
Children, under ſome grievous <hi>Croſs</hi> or <hi>Affliction.</hi> This occaſion
alſo falls fit for his deſign of wounding the Conſcience; when
the Hand of the Lord is <hi>lifted up</hi> againſt them, and their thoughts
<hi>diſordered</hi> by the ſtroke, ſuggeſting at that time God's <hi>Anger</hi> to
them and their <hi>ſins;</hi> he can eaſily frame an Argument from theſe
Grounds, That they are not reconciled to God, and that they
are dealt withal as Enemies. <hi>David</hi> ſeldom met with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
trouble, but he at the ſame time had a Conflict with Satan
about his ſpiritual condition, or ſtate, as his frequent deprecations
of Divine Wrath, at ſuch times do teſtifie; <hi>Lord, rebuke me not in
thy Wrath,</hi> &amp;c. There is indeed but a ſtep betwixt diſcompoſure
of Spirit, and Spiritual Troubles; as hath been proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>4. When Satan hath <hi>prepared</hi> the Hearts of God's Children by
<hi>Atheiſtical,</hi> or <hi>Blaſphemous</hi> thoughts, he takes that occaſion to <hi>deny</hi>
their Grace and Intereſt in Chriſt. And the Argument <hi>at that
time,</hi> ſeems unanſwerable. Can Chriſt lodg in an Heart ſo full
of horrid Blaſphemies againſt him? Is it poſſible it ſhould be
Waſhed and Sanctified, when it produceth ſuch filthy curſed
thoughts? All the troubles of Affrightment (of which before)
are improveable to this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>5. Another ſpiritual occaſion for Spiritual Trouble, is <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly;</hi>
few Perſons diſtempered therewith, do eſcape Satans
hands, at one time or other, he caſts his Net over them, and
ſeeks to ſtab them with his Weapon. <hi>Melancholy</hi> indeed affords
ſo <hi>many</hi> advantages to him, and thoſe ſo <hi>anſwerable</hi> to his deſign,
that it is no wonder if he make much of it.<note place="margin">Willis de ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Brut. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholia.</note> For, 1. Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affects both <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> it affords both <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Sadneſs,</hi>
and <hi>deformed, miſhapen, delirous</hi> imaginations to work upon;
than which, nothing can be more for his purpoſe. For where
the Heart <hi>trembles,</hi> and the Head is <hi>darkned,</hi> there every Object
is miſrepreſented; the <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Brain are <hi>monſtrous</hi> appearances,
reflected from <hi>opake</hi> and <hi>dark</hi> Spirits, ſo that Satan hath no more
to do, but to ſuggeſt the new matter of Fear. For that Queſtion,
<hi>Whether the Man be Converted,</hi> &amp;c. being once ſtarted, to a mind
already diſtempered with Fear, muſt of it ſelf (it being a buſineſs
of ſo high a nature) without Satan's further purſuit, ſummon the
utmoſt powers of ſadneſs and miſreprehenſion, to raiſe a Storm.
2. Beſides, the <hi>impreſſions</hi> of Melancholy are always <hi>ſtrong,</hi> it is
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:49412:185"/>
ſtrong in its <hi>fears,</hi> (or elſe Men would never be tempted to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy</hi>
themſelves); it is ſtrong in its <hi>miſtakes</hi> (or elſe they could
never perſwade themſelves of the truth of <hi>fooliſh, abſurd,</hi> and
<hi>impoſſible</hi> Fancies); as that of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who by a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
apprehenſion, believing himſelf to be <hi>a Beaſt,</hi> forſook the
company of Men, and betook to the Fields to eat Graſs with
Oxen. The imaginations of the Melancholick are <hi>never idle,</hi>
and yet <hi>ſtraightned,</hi> or confined to a few things; and then the
Brain being weakned as to a true and <hi>regular</hi> apprehenſion, it
frames nothing but <hi>Bugbears,</hi> and yet with the higheſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of certainty. 3. Theſe impreſſions are uſually <hi>laſting,</hi> not
vaniſhing as an <hi>early Dew,</hi> but they continue for Months and
Years. 4. And yet they have only <hi>ſo much</hi> underſtanding left
them, as ſerves to nouriſh their fears. If their underſtanding
had been <hi>quite</hi> gone, their fears would vaniſh with them: As the
Flame is extinguiſhed for want of Air:<note place="margin">Fael Plateri prox. med. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. de mentis aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</note> but they have only <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi>
to let them <hi>ſee</hi> their miſery, and <hi>ſence</hi> to make them <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive</hi>
of their pain. And therefore will they <hi>pray</hi> with floods of
<hi>Tears,</hi> unexpreſſible <hi>Groanings,</hi> deepeſt <hi>Sighing,</hi> and <hi>trembling</hi>
Joynts, to be <hi>delivered</hi> from their fears. 5. They are alſo apt after
eaſe of their troubles, to have <hi>frequent returns:</hi> What diſpoſition
(all theſe things being conſidered) can be more exactly ſhaped
to ſerve Satans turn? If he would have Men to believe <hi>the worſt</hi>
of themſelves, he hath ſuch imaginations to work upon, as are
already misſhapen into a <hi>deformity</hi> of evil ſurmiſing. Would he
<hi>terrifie</hi> by Fears, or <hi>diſtreſs</hi> by Sadneſs? he hath that already; and 'tis
but <hi>altering the Object</hi> (which oftentimes needs not, for naturally
the ſerious Melancholick imploys all his Griefs upon his ſuppoſed
miſerable eſtate of Soul) and then he hath Spiritual diſtreſs.
Would he continue them <hi>long</hi> under their ſorrows, or take them
upon all occaſions <hi>at his pleaſure,</hi> or act them to a <hi>greater height</hi>
than ordinary? Still the Melancholick temper ſuits him. This
is ſufficient for caution, that we take ſpecial care of our Bodies
for the preventing, or abating of that Humour, by all lawful
means, if we would not have the Devil to abuſe us at his will.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> or <hi>Death-Bed,</hi> is another ſolemn occaſion, which
the Devil ſeldom miſſeth with his will. Death is a ſerious thing,
it repreſents the Soul and Eternity <hi>to the Life.</hi> While they are
at a diſtance, Men look ſlightly upon theſe, but when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
near to them, Men uſually have ſuch a ſight of them, as
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:49412:185"/>
they never had before. We may truly call Sickneſs and Death-Bed,
an <hi>hour of Temptation,</hi> which Satan will make uſe of with
the more miſchievous induſtry, becauſe he hath but a <hi>ſhort time</hi>
for it. That's the laſt Conflict, and if he miſs that, we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his reach for ever. So that in this caſe Satan incourageth
himſelf to the Battel, with <hi>a now, or never.</hi> And hence we find,
that it is uſual for the dying Servants of God, to undergo moſt
<hi>ſharp</hi> Encounters; then to tell them (when the Soul is about to
looſe from the Body) that they are yet in their Blood, without
God, and Hope, is enough to affright them into the <hi>extreameſt
Agonies;</hi> for they ſee <hi>no time</hi> before them anſwerable to ſo great
a <hi>work,</hi> if it be yet to do. And withal, they are under vaſt
<hi>diſcouragments</hi> from the wearineſs and pains of Sickneſs, their
underſtandings and faculties being alſo dull, and ſtupified; ſo that
if at this laſt plunge, God ſhould not extraordinarily appear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
Satan, and to pluck them out of theſe <hi>great Waters</hi> (as he
often doth, by the fuller interpoſition of the Light of his Face,
and the larger Teſtimony of his Spirit) after their long and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
profeſſion of their Faith, and holy Walking, their Light
would be <hi>put out in Darkneſs,</hi> and they would <hi>lie down in Sorrow.</hi>
Yet this I muſt note, That as deſirous as Satan is to improve this
occaſion, he is often remarkably <hi>diſappointed,</hi> and that wherein
he (it may be) and we would leaſt expect, I mean in regard of
thoſe, who through a timerous Diſpoſition, or <hi>Melancholy,</hi> or
upon other Accounts, are (as I may ſo ſay) <hi>all their life-time ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Bondage;</hi> thoſe Men who are uſually exerciſed with <hi>frequent
fits</hi> of Spiritual Trouble, when they come to Sickneſs, Death-Bed,
and ſome other <hi>ſingular occaſions</hi> of trouble, though we
might ſuſpect their fears would <hi>then</hi> be working, if ever; Yet
God out of gracious Indulgence to them, (conſidering their
<hi>Mould and Faſhion,</hi> or becauſe he would prevent their <hi>extream</hi>
fainting, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> doth meet them with <hi>larger</hi> Teſtimonies of his
Favour, <hi>higher</hi> Joys, more confident ſatisfactions in his Love,
than ever they received at any time <hi>before;</hi> and this to their
wonder, their high admiration, making the times which they
were wont to <hi>fear moſt,</hi> to be times of greateſt <hi>Conſolation.</hi> This
Obſervation I have grounded, not upon <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> Inſtances, but
could produce a cloud of Witneſſes for it. Enough it is to check
our <hi>forward</hi> fears of a <hi>future</hi> evil day, and to heal us of a ſighing
Diſtemper, while we afflict our ſelves with ſuch thoughts as
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:49412:186"/>
theſe: <hi>If I have ſo many fears in Health, how ſhall I be able to go
through the valley of the ſhadow of Death?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. I have one thing more to add, for theſe diſcovery of theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Troubles, and that is to ſhew you the <hi>Engines</hi> by which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
works them, and they are theſe <hi>two, Sophiſtry,</hi> and <hi>Fears.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. As to his <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> by which he argues the Children of God
into a wrong apprehenſion of themſelves, it is very great. He
hath a wonderful dexterity in framing Arguments againſt their
Peace, he hath variety of ſhrewd Objections and ſubtile Anſwers,
to the uſual Replies, by which they ſeek to beat him off. There
is not a <hi>Fallacy</hi> by which a cunning <hi>Sophiſter</hi> would ſeek to entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
his Adverſary in Diſputation, but Satan would make uſe of
it; as I might particularly ſhew you, if it were proper for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Auditory. Though he hath ſo much impudence, as not to
bluſh at the moſt <hi>ſilly contemptible</hi> Reaſon that can be offered; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
he hath alſo ſo much wit as to urge (though never
<hi>true,</hi> yet) always <hi>probable</hi> Arguments. How much he can <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail</hi>
upon the beliefs of Men, in caſes relating to their <hi>Souls,</hi> may
be conjectured by the ſucceſs he hath upon the <hi>underſtandings</hi> of
Men, when he argues them into <hi>Errour,</hi> and makes them <hi>believe
a lye.</hi> We uſually ſay (and that truly) that Satan cannot, in
any caſe, <hi>force</hi> us properly to conſent; yet conſidering the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which he takes, and the ways he hath to <hi>prepare</hi> the Hearts
of Men for his impreſſions, and then his very great <hi>ſubtilty</hi> in
diſputing, we may ſay that he can ſo order the matter, that he
will <hi>ſeldom miſs</hi> of his aim. It would be an endleſs work to
gather up all the Arguments that Satan hath made uſe of, to
prove the Condition, or State of God's Children to be bad: But
that I may not altogether diſappoint your expectations in that
thing, I ſhall preſent to your view Satan's <hi>uſual Topicks,</hi> the
<hi>Common-places,</hi> or Heads unto which all his Arguments may be
reduced. And they are,</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Scripture abuſed,</hi> and perverted. His way is not only to <hi>ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt</hi>
that they are Unregenerate, or under an evil frame of Heart,
but to <hi>offer proof</hi> that theſe Accuſations are true. And becauſe he
ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h to do with them that profeſs a belief of Scriptures, as the
Oracles of God, he will fetch his proofs from thence; telling
them that he will evidence what he ſaith <hi>from Scripture.</hi> Thus
ſometimes he aſſaults the weaker unskilful ſort of Chriſtians, <hi>Thou
art not a Child of God: for they that are ſo, are Enlightned, tranſlated
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:49412:186"/>
from Darkneſs, they are the Children of the Light; but thou art a
poor, ignorant, dark blind Creature, and therefore no Child of God.</hi>
Sometimes he labours to conclude the like, from the <hi>Infirmities</hi> of
God's Children, abuſing to this purpoſe, that of 1 <hi>John 3. 9.
He that is born of God, doth not commit ſin.</hi> And, <hi>He cannot ſin,
becauſe he is born of God.</hi> Thus he urgeth it, <hi>Can any thing be
more plainly and fully aſſerted? Is not this Scripture? Canſt thou
deny this?</hi> Then he purſues, <hi>But thou ſinneſt often, that is thine
own complaint againſt thy ſelf, thy Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs to
the truth of this Accuſation; therefore thou canſt be no Child of God.</hi>
Sometimes he <hi>plays</hi> upon <hi>words</hi> that are uſed in <hi>divers</hi> ſenſes, (a
fit Engine for the Devil to work by) for what is true in one
ſenſe, will be falſe in another; and his arguing is from that which
is <hi>true,</hi> to that which is falſe. I remember one that was long
racked with that of <hi>Rev. 21. 8. The fearful and unbelieving,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>ſhall have their part in the Lake, which burns with Fire and Brimſtone.</hi>
From whence the Party thus argued: The propoſion is <hi>true,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis Scripture, and I cannot <hi>deny</hi> the Aſſumption. <hi>Fearful
I am, becauſe I am doubtful of Salvation; and unbelieving I am,
for I cannot believe that I am Regenerate, or in a ſtate of Grace, and
therefore I cannot avoid the Concluſion.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
againſt ſome, from 1 <hi>John 4. 18. There is no fear in love, but
perfect love caſteth out fear;</hi> but, <hi>thou art full of fears, therefore thou
loveſt not God.</hi> Sometimes he makes uſe of thoſe Scriptures, that
make the <hi>prevailing degree</hi> of our love and reſpects to God, above
the World, and the things of this Life, to be the Characters of true
Grace; as that of <hi>John, If any Man love the World, the love of the
Father is not in him:</hi> And that of Chriſt, <hi>If a Man love any thing
more than Me, he is not worthy of Me: he that forſakes not all for Me,
cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> &amp;c. Then he urgeth upon them their <hi>love</hi>
of the World, and <hi>unwillingneſs</hi> to part with their Eſtates; and
ſo brings the Concluſion upon them. Inſtances might be infinite,
but by theſe you may judg of the reſt. Let us now caſt our Eye
upon his <hi>ſubtilty,</hi> in managing his Arguments againſt men. 1. He
grounds his Arguments <hi>on Scripture,</hi> becauſe that hath <hi>authority</hi>
with it, and the very troubled Conſcience hath a <hi>reverence</hi> to it.
2. He always <hi>ſuits</hi> his Scriptures, which he thus cites, to that
wherein the Conſcience is <hi>moſt tender:</hi> if there be any thing that
affords matter of <hi>ſuſpition,</hi> or fear, he will be ſure to chuſe ſuch
an <hi>Arrow</hi> out of the <hi>Quiver</hi> of Scriptures, as will directly <hi>hit
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:49412:187"/>
the Mark.</hi> 3. Though in the citation of Scripture, he always
urgeth a ſenſe which the Holy Ghoſt <hi>never</hi> intended: Yet there
will be always ſomething in thoſe Scriptures which he makes uſe
of, which <hi>in words</hi> at leaſt, ſeem to <hi>favour</hi> his Concluſion; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in the Inſtances now given. For when he would conclude
a Man not to be a Child of God becauſe of his Ignorance, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his Argument is true; it may be the Man is ſenſible that
his knowledg is but <hi>little;</hi> compared with the meaſures which
ſome others have; or that he is at a <hi>loſs,</hi> or <hi>confuſed</hi> in many
Doctrinal points of Religion; or hath but <hi>little experience</hi> in many
Practical caſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This, as it is true, ſo is it his trouble; and
whilſt he is poring upon his defect, Satan claps an <hi>Arreſt</hi> upon
him, of a far <hi>greater</hi> Debt than God chargeth upon him, and
from Scriptures that ſpeak of a <hi>total ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi>
of Religion, (as that there is a God, that Chriſt Jeſus is God
and Man, the Redeemer of Mankind by a ſatisfaction to Divine
Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> Or of a <hi>wilful ignorance</hi> of the <hi>worth</hi> of the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
of the Goſpel, or its <hi>reality</hi> (which is diſcovered in the <hi>refuſal</hi>
of the terms thereof) he concludes him to be in a ſtate of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
whereas the Ignorance which the Man <hi>complains</hi> of, is not the
Ignorance which thoſe Scriptures <hi>intend.</hi> So in the next Inſtance,
the <hi>ſins</hi> which a Child of God complains of, are thoſe of <hi>daily
Incurſion,</hi> which he labours and ſtrives againſt; but that <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſin</hi> mentioned in the Text, hath reſpect to the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi>
who taught a <hi>liberty</hi> in ſinning, and fancied a <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant
with the <hi>avowed practice</hi> of Iniquity: Hence doth <hi>John,</hi>
1 John 3. 7. <hi>directly</hi> face their Opinion, in theſe terms, <hi>Little
Children, let no Man deceive you; he that doth Righteouſneſs is righteous.</hi>
And, <hi>He that is born of God neither doth,</hi> nor can, avouch a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>ſinning,</hi> it being contrary to the Principles of the New Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
So that the <hi>miſcarriages</hi> of Infirmity which the Child of
God laments in himſelf, are not the <hi>ſame</hi> with that of the Text,
upon which Satan grounds the Accuſation. The like may be
ſaid of the third Inſtance, from <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 18. The threatning
there is againſt ſuch a <hi>fear</hi> to loſe the comforts of the World,
that they <hi>dare not</hi> believe the Goſpel to be true, and accept it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly:
which is nothing to thoſe fears and doubtings that
may be in a Child of God, in reference to his Happineſs. Thus
in all the reſt, the Fallacy lies in <hi>miſapplying</hi> the Scripture (to
ſuit them to that wherein the Conſcience is tender) under a ſenſe
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:49412:187"/>
which was never intended by them; yet in another ſenſe, the
thing charged upon the Conſcience is true. 4. Yet is Satan ſo
ſubtile, that when he diſputes by ſuch Fallacious Arguments, he
chiefly endeavours to draw off the <hi>Defendants Eye</hi> and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
from that <hi>part</hi> of the Argument wherein its <hi>weakneſs</hi> lies
(which in this caſe, is always in the abuſe of the Scripture to a
wrong ſenſe); this he doth, partly from the advantage which
he hath from the <hi>reverence</hi> that they carry to Scripture, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it to be true, and are not willing to <hi>ſuſpect the ſenſe;</hi> and
many are ſo weak, that if they ſhould, Satan is ſo cunning that
he can eaſily <hi>baffle</hi> them in any diſtinction that they can make.
And partly from the <hi>ſenſe</hi> they have of that whereof they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
they feel themſelves <hi>ſo ſore</hi> in that place, (and for that
very end doth Satan direct his Scripture to hit it) that they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<hi>take it for granted,</hi> that the <hi>hinge</hi> of the Controverſie turns
upon it, and that the whole Diſpute reſts upon it. Now Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
having theſe fair advantages, by a further improvement of
them, hides the weakneſs of his Argument. For, 1. He takes
that ſenſe of the Scripture (in which he miſapplies it) <hi>for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and that with great <hi>confidence,</hi> making as if there were no
doubt there. 2. He <hi>turns</hi> always that part of the Argument <hi>to
them,</hi> which they can <hi>leaſt</hi> anſwer, preſſing them eagerly with
the <hi>matter of charge</hi> (which they are as ready to confeſs, as he is
to accuſe them of) and <hi>aggravating</hi> it very buſily. And becauſe
the unskilful have no other <hi>direction</hi> for the finding the Knot of
the Controverſie, than Satan's <hi>buſle,</hi> (though he, like the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing,</hi>
makes the greateſt noiſe when he is furtheſt from his Neſt, on
purpoſe to draw them into a greater miſtake) they <hi>look no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
and then not being able to anſwer, they are ſoon caſt, and
ſtriking in with the concluſion againſt themſelves, they multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their Sorrows, and cry out of themſelves as miſerable.</p>
                     <p>2. Another piece of his Sophiſtry, is the improving certain
<hi>falſe Notions</hi> (which Chriſtians of the weaker ſort have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
as <hi>proofs</hi> of their Unregeneracy, or bad Condition. As
there are <hi>Vulgar Errors</hi> concerning Natural things, ſo there are
<hi>Popular Errors</hi> concerning Spiritual things. Theſe miſtakes, in a
great part, have their Original from the Fancies, or Miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of <hi>unskilful</hi> Men. Some indeed have (it may be)
been preached and taught as Truths, others have riſen (without
a Teacher) from meer Ignorance, being the concluſions and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:49412:188"/>
which weak Heads have framed to themſelves, from the
Sayings, or Practices of Men, which have not been either ſo
<hi>cleared</hi> from the danger of miſtake, or not ſo <hi>diſtinctly</hi> apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as was neceſſary. Theſe falſe Inferences once ſet on foot, are
<hi>traditionally</hi> handed down to others, and in time they gain (among
the ſimple) the opinion of undoubted Truths. Now where
ever Satan finds any of theſe that are fit for his purpoſe (for to be
ſure whatever miſtake we entertain, he will at one time or other
caſt it in our way) he will make it the foundation of an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt him that hath received it, and that with very great
advantage. For a falſhood in the <hi>Premiſes,</hi> will uſually produce a
falſhood in the <hi>Concluſion.</hi> And theſe falſhoods being taken for
granted, the Devil is not put to the trouble to prove them, if
then he can but exactly fit them to ſomething in the party which
he cannot deny, he forthwith carries the cauſe, and condemns
him by his <hi>own conceſſions,</hi> as out of his <hi>own mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis ſcarce poſſible to number the falſe Notions which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
entertained among Chriſtians, relating to Grace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
much leſs thoſe that may afterward ariſe. But I ſhall
mention ſome that Satan frequently makes uſe of, as grounds of
Objection.</p>
                     <p>1. 'Tis a common apprehenſion among the weaker ſort, that
Converſion is <hi>always</hi> accompanied with <hi>great fear and terrour.</hi>
This is true in ſome (as hath been ſaid); and though none of the
Preachers of the Goſpel have aſſerted the univerſality of theſe
<hi>greater</hi> meaſures of Trouble, yet the People taking notice, that
<hi>many</hi> ſpeak of their deep humiliations in Converſion; and that
<hi>ſeveral Authors</hi> have ſet forth the greatneſs of Diſtreſs that <hi>ſome</hi>
have been caſt into on that occaſion, (though without any inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of fixing this into a <hi>general Rule)</hi> have from thence ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that all the Converted are brought to their Comforts <hi>through
the flames of Hell.</hi> Upon this miſtake, the Devil diſquiets thoſe
that have not felt theſe <hi>extream Agonies</hi> of Sorrow in themſelves;
and tells them that it is a <hi>ſure ſign</hi> that they are not yet Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Though 'tis eaſie for a Man that ſees the falſhood of the
Notion, to anſwer the Argument, yet he that <hi>believes it to be true,</hi>
cannot tell what to ſay, becauſe he finds he never was under ſuch
Troubles, and now he begins to be troubled becauſe he was not
troubled <hi>before,</hi> or (as he ſuppoſeth) not troubled <hi>enough.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="353" facs="tcp:49412:188"/>
2. Another falſe Notion is, That a Convert can give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of his Converſion. This is true
in <hi>ſome,</hi> as in <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome others, whoſe Change hath been
ſudden and remarkable, though in <hi>many</hi> this is far otherwiſe;
who can better give account that they <hi>are</hi> Converted, than by
what <hi>Steps, Degrees,</hi> and <hi>Methods,</hi> they were brought to it. But
if any of theſe receive the Notion, they will preſently find that
Satan will turn the edge of it againſt them, and will tell them that
they are <hi>not Converted,</hi> becauſe they cannot nominate the time
when, nor the manner how ſuch a Change was wrought.</p>
                     <p>3. Some take it for granted, that Converſion is accompanied
with a <hi>remarkable meaſure of Gifts</hi> for Prayer and Exhortation; and
then the Devil objects it to them, That they are not Converted,
becauſe they cannot <hi>Pray</hi> as others, or <hi>Speak</hi> of the things of God
ſo readily, fluently, and affectionately, as ſome others can. Thus
the poor weak Chriſtian is baffled for want of <hi>Abilities</hi> to expreſs
himſelf to God and Men.</p>
                     <p>4. Falſe Notions about the <hi>nature of Faith,</hi> are a ſad ſtumbling-Block
to ſome. Many ſuppoſe that Saving Faith is a <hi>certain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
that our Sins are Pardoned, and that we ſhall be Saved;</hi> making
Faith and Aſſurance all one. This miſtake is the deeper rooted
in the Minds of Men, becauſe ſome have directly taught ſo, and
thoſe, Men of Eſtimation; whoſe words are entertained with
great Reverence by well-meaning Chriſtians. For whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
this may be pleaded in excuſe, that they have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſcribed Faith in <hi>its height,</hi> than in its <hi>loweſt meaſures.</hi> How
ever it be, thoſe that have no other underſtanding of the nature
of Faith, can never anſwer Satan's Argument, if he takes them
at any time at the <hi>advantage of fear, or doubting:</hi> For then he
will diſpute thus, <hi>Faith is a belief that ſins are Pardoned, but thou
doſt not believe this; therefore thou haſt no Faith.</hi> Oh, what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of poor doubting Chriſtians have been diſtreſſed with this
Argument!</p>
                     <p>5. Some take it for a truth, that <hi>growth</hi> of Grace is always
<hi>viſible,</hi> and the progreſs remarkable. And then becauſe they can
make no ſuch diſcovery of themſelves, the Devil concludes their
Grace to be counterfeit and hypocritical.</p>
                     <p>6. Of like nature are ſome <hi>miſtaken ſigns</hi> of true Grace, as that
true Grace fears God <hi>only for his Goodneſs.</hi> And then if there be
any apprehenſion of Divine Diſpleaſure impreſſed upon the Heart,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:49412:189"/>
though upon the neceſſary occaſion of miſcarriage, they through
the Devils inſtigation, conclude, that they are <hi>under a ſpirit of
Bondage,</hi> and their ſuppoſed Grace not <hi>true,</hi> or not <hi>genuine</hi> at
leaſt; according to that <hi>diſpoſition</hi> which the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> will
furniſh a Man withal. 'Tis alſo another miſtaken ſign of Grace:
That it doth direct a Man to love God <hi>ſingly</hi> for himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>leaſt regard</hi> to his <hi>own Salvation;</hi> for that, they think, is
but Self-love. Now when a Child of God doth not ſee his love
to God ſo <hi>diſtinct,</hi> but that his <hi>own ſalvation</hi> is twiſted with it,
Satan gets advantage of him, and forceth him to caſt away his
love as adulterate and <hi>ſelfiſh.</hi> Like to this miſtake (but of an
higher ſtrain) is that of ſome, That where Grace is true, 'tis ſo
carried forth to honour God, that the Man that hath it, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<hi>God may be honoured, though he ſhould be damned.</hi> God doth
not put us to ſuch Queſtions as theſe, but upon ſuppoſition that
this is true; the grace of moſt Men will be ſhaken by the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that Satan will make from thence; he can and will preſently
put the miſtaken to it, <hi>Canſt thou ſay thou art willing to go to Hell,
that God may be glorified? If not, where is thy Grace?</hi> From ſuch
miſtakes as theſe, he diſputes againſt the holineſs of the Children
of God; and 'tis impoſſible but that he ſhould carry the Cauſe,
againſt thoſe who grant theſe things to be true. Satan can unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
ſhew them, that their Hearts will not anſwer ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of a Convert, or gracious Heart, as theſe falſe Notions
will make. So long then as they hold theſe Notions, they have
no relief againſt Satan's Concluſions; no comfort can be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred,
till they be convinced that they have embraced Miſtakes
for Truths. And how difficult that will be in this caſe (where
the confidence of the Notion is great, and the ſuſpition ſtrong,
that the defect is only in the Heart) hath been determined by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
experience already.</p>
                     <p>3. The third piece of Satan's Sophiſtry, from whence he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
falſe Concluſions, is his <hi>miſrepreſentation of God.</hi> In this he
directly croſſeth the deſign of the Scriptures, where God in his
Nature, and Dealings is ſo ſet forth, that the Weakeſt, the moſt
Afflicted and Toſſed, may receive incouragement of Acceptance,
and of his Fatherly Care over them in their ſaddeſt Tryals. Yet
withal, leſt Men ſhould turn his Grace into Wantonneſs, and
embolden themſelves in ſin becauſe of his Clemency, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſometimes give us lively deſcriptions of his Anger againſt
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:49412:189"/>
thoſe that wickedly preſume upon his Goodneſs, and continue
ſo to do. <hi>Both</hi> theſe Deſcriptions of God ſhould be taken <hi>toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
as affording the only true Repreſentation of him. He is ſo
gentle to the humbled ſenſible Sinner, that <hi>He will not break their
bruiſed Reed, nor quench</hi> their <hi>ſmoking Flax.</hi> And ſo careful of
Health, that (for their recovery) he will not <hi>leave</hi> them <hi>altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unpuniſhed;</hi> nor ſuffer them to ruine themſelves by a Surfeit
upon worldly Comforts; yet <hi>with the froward</hi> he <hi>will ſhew himſelf
froward,</hi> Pſal. 18. 26. And, <hi>As for ſuch as turn aſide unto their crooked
ways, the Lord ſhall lead them forth with the workers of Iniquity,</hi>
Pſal. 125. 5. He will <hi>put out the Candle of the wicked,</hi> for he ſets
them in <hi>ſlippery places: So that they are caſt down into Deſtruction,
and brought into Deſolation as in a moment; they are conſumed with
Terrours.</hi> Now Satan will ſometimes argue againſt the Children
of God, and endeavour to break their hopes, by turning <hi>that part</hi>
of the Deſcription of God againſt them; which is <hi>intended</hi> for
the diſmounting of the confidence of the Wicked, and the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down of high looks. By this means he wreſts the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God to a contrary end, and miſrepreſents God to a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
afflicted Soul. This he doth,</p>
                     <p>1. By miſrepreſenting <hi>his Nature:</hi> Here he reads a ſolemn Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of the <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, but always with reflection
upon the <hi>vileneſs</hi> and unworthineſs of the Perſon againſt whom he
intends his Dart. And thus he Argues: <hi>Lift up thine eyes to the
Heavens, behold the brightneſs of God's Glory: Conſider his unſpotted
Holineſs, his infinite Juſtice. The Heavens are not clean in his ſight,
how much more abominable and filthy then art thou? His Eyes are
pure, he cannot wink at, nor approve of the leaſt ſin: How canſt thou
then imagine (except thou be intolerably impudent) that he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſuch an unclean wretch into his favour? He is a jealous God, and
will by no means acquit the guilty; Canſt thou then with any ſhew of
reaſon, conclude thy ſelf to be his Child? He beholds the wicked afar
off; he ſhuts out their Prayer; he laughs at their Calamity; he mocks
when their Fear comes; and therefore thou haſt no cauſe to think that
he will hearthy cry, though thou ſhouldeſt make many Prayers. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſuppoſed that he will incline his Ear. 'Tis his expreſs Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
that if any Man regard iniquity in his Heart, the Lord will
not hear his Prayer.</hi> This, and a great deal more will he ſay.
And while Satan ſpeaks but at this rate we may call him modeſt,
becauſe his Allegations are in themſelves true, if they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:49412:190"/>
rightly. Sometimes he will go further, and plainly <hi>belye</hi>
God, ſpeaking incredible falſhoods of him: but becauſe theſe
properly appertain to an higher ſort of Troubles, of which I am
next to ſpeak, I ſhall not hear mention them. However, if he
ſtops here, he ſaith enough againſt any Servant of God, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
an <hi>high ſenſe</hi> of his unworthineſs. For being thus brought
to the view of theſe <hi>aſtoniſhing</hi> Attributes, he is daſhed out of
Countenance, and can think no other, but that 'tis very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that <hi>ſo unworthy</hi> a Sinner ſhould have any intereſt in <hi>ſo Holy</hi>
a God. Thus the Devil affrights him off, turning the <hi>wrong ſide</hi>
of the Deſcription of God to him; and in the mean time <hi>hiding</hi>
that part of it that ſpeaks God's wonderful Condeſcenſions, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Compaſſions, unſpeakable readineſs to accept the humble
broken-hearted, Weary, heavy-laden Sinner, that is proſtrate at
his Foot-ſtool for Pardon. All which are on purpoſe declared in
the Deſcription of God's Nature, to obviate this Temptation,
and to encourage the Weak.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>He miſrepreſents God in his</hi> Providence. <hi>If God chaſtiſe
his Children by any Affliction, Satan perverſly wreſts it to a bad
Conſtruction, eſpecially if the Affliction be</hi> ſharp, <hi>or ſeem to be</hi>
above <hi>their ſtrength, or</hi> frequent, <hi>and moſt of all if it ſeem to</hi>
croſs <hi>their Hopes and Prayers; for then he argues,</hi> Theſe are not
the chaſtiſements of Sons: God indeed will viſit their Tranſgreſſions with
Rods, but his dealing with thee is plainly of another nature, for he
breaketh thee with his Tempeſts. And whereas he corrects his Sons that ſerve
him in meaſure, thou art bowed down with thy trouble to diſtreſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair:
but he will lay no more upon his Sons than they are able to bear, he
will not always chide his Servants; but thou art afflicted every Morning.
And beſides, if thou wert pure and upright, ſurely now he would awake
for thee, and make the habitation of thy Righteouſneſs proſperous: for to
his Sons he ſaith, Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee;
and thou ſhalt glorifyme. <hi>Pſal. 50. 15. Hence comes the complaint
of many; that they are not regenerated, becauſe they think God
deals not with them as with others.</hi> Oh! ſay they, we know God
chaſtiſeth every Son whom he receiveth: but our caſe is every way different
from theirs, our troubles are Plagues, not Rods; our cry is not heard, our
Prayers diſregarded, our ſtrength faileth us, our Hearts fret againſt the
Lord, ſo that not only the nature and quality of our Affections, but the
frame of our heart under them, in not enduring the burthen (which is,
the great Character of the chaſtiſement of Sons, <hi>Heb. 12. 7.)</hi> plainly
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:49412:190"/>
evinceth that we are under Gods hatred, and are not his Children.
<hi>This Objection, though it might ſeem eaſy to be anſwered by
thoſe that are not at preſent concerned, yet it will prove a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
buſineſs to thoſe that are under the ſmart of Afflictions. How
much a holy and wiſe Man may be gravell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d by it, you may ſee in</hi>
Pſal. 73. <hi>where the Prophet is put to a grievous plunge upon this
very objection, ver.</hi> 14. all the day long have I been plagued, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed
every Morning.</p>
                     <p>And yet in all this Satan doth but play the Sophiſter, working
upon the advantages, which the <hi>nature</hi> of the affliction, and the
<hi>temper</hi> of Mens Hearts do afford him. For 1. Afflictions are a
great <hi>depth,</hi> one of the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of God, ſo that 'tis hard to know
what God intends by them. 2. The <hi>end</hi> of the Lord, is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<hi>at firſt,</hi> but at ſome diſtance, when the Fruits thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to appear. 3. The mind of the afflicted cannot always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<hi>regularly</hi> in making a judgment of God's deſign upon them:
eſpecially at firſt when 'tis <hi>ſtounded</hi> by the aſſault, and all things
in <hi>confuſion,</hi> Faith is to ſeek, Patience awanting, and Love ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering;
after it hath recollected it ſelf, and attained any <hi>calmneſs,</hi>
to fit it for <hi>a review</hi> of the ways of God, and of the Heart, it is
better enabled to fix ſome grounds of Hope. Lam. 3. 19, 20, 21.
<hi>This I recall to my Mind, therefore have I Hope.</hi> 4. Afflictions have
<hi>a Light</hi> and <hi>a Dark</hi> ſide, and their appearances are according to
our <hi>poſture</hi> in which we view them: as ſome Pictures, which if we
look upon them one way, they appear to be Angels, if another
way, they ſeem Devils.</p>
                     <p>5. Some Men in Affliction do <hi>only buſy</hi> themſelves in looking
upon the dark ſide of Affliction. Their diſpoſition (either through
<hi>natural timerouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>ſtrong impreſſions</hi> of Temptation) is only to
<hi>meditate terrours,</hi> and to ſurmiſe evils. Theſe Men out of the
Croſs, can draw nothing but the <hi>Wormwood</hi> and the <hi>Gall,</hi> while
others, that have another Proſpect of them, obſerve <hi>mixtures</hi> of
Mercy and Gentleneſs, and do <hi>melt</hi> into ſubmiſſion and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.
Theſe (conſidered together) are a great advantage to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
in diſputing againſt the peace of Gods afflicted Children, and
it often falls out, that as he doth <hi>miſrepreſent</hi> God's deſign, ſo do
they (urged by Temptation), upon that account <hi>misjudge</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>3. He alſo miſrepreſents God in the <hi>works of his Spirit;</hi> if God
withdraw his countenance, or by his Spirit ſignifies his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:49412:191"/>
to the Conſciences of any, if he permit Satan to moleſt them
with Spiritual Temptations, preſently Satan takes occaſion to put
his falſe and malignant interpretation upon all: he tells them
that <hi>Gods hiding</hi> his Face is his <hi>caſting them off,</hi> that the <hi>threatnings</hi>
ſignified to their Conſcience, are plain <hi>declarations</hi> that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtate is Wrath and Darkneſs. That Satans <hi>moleſtations</hi> by
Temptations, ſhew them to be yet under <hi>his power;</hi> that the <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>
of their former Peace, Joy, and ſenſible delight which they had
in the ways of God, is beyond contradiction, an evidence that
God hath <hi>no delight</hi> in them, nor they in him; that their Faith was
but that of <hi>Temporaries,</hi> their Joy but that of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> which is
only for a moment. How often have I heard Chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
thus? <hi>We cannot be in a ſtate of Grace, our Conſciences lye
under the ſenſe of Gods diſpleaſure, they give teſtimony againſt us, and
we know that teſtimony is true, for we feel it. 'Tis true, time was when
we thought we had a delight in Hearing, Praying, Meditating, but now
all is a burthen to us, we can reliſh nothing, we can profit nothing, we can
remember nothing: time was when we thought we had aſſurance, and our
Hearts rejoyced in us; ſometimes we have thought our Hearts had as much
of Peace and Comfort as they could hold, now all is vaniſhed and we are
under ſad fears: if God had had a favour to us, would he have dealt thus
with us?</hi> Thus are they cheated into a belief that they never had
any Grace; they take all for granted that is urged againſt them:
they cannot conſider Gods <hi>deſign</hi> in hiding his Face, nor yet can
they ſee how <hi>Grace acts</hi> in them under theſe complainings; how
they expreſs their <hi>Love</hi> to God in their <hi>deſires</hi> and pantings after
him, in their <hi>bewailing</hi> of his abſence, in <hi>abhorring</hi> and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but their preſent feeling, (and an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
from ſence is very ſtrong) bears down all before
it.</p>
                     <p>Thus doth Satan frame his Arguments from miſrepreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God, which (though a right view of God would eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
them, yet) how difficult it is for a Perſon in an hour of
Temptation to diſpel, by a right apprehenſion of the ways
of the Holy God, doth abundantly appear from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.
where the caſe of <hi>Aſaph</hi> (or whoever elſe he was) doth inform us
1. That 'tis uſual for Satan, for the diſquieting of the Hearts of
Gods Children, to offer <hi>a falſe Proſpect</hi> of God. 2. That this
<hi>overwhelms</hi> their Hearts with grief, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. 3. That the more they
perſiſt in the proſecution of this method, under the <hi>Miſts of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,</hi>
                        <pb n="359" facs="tcp:49412:191"/>
they ſee the leſs, being apt to miſconſtrue every thing in
God to their diſadvantage, <hi>ver. 3. I remembred God, and was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</hi>
4. The reaſon of all that trouble lies in this, that they can
<hi>only conclude</hi> wrath and deſertion from God's carriage toward
them. 5. That till they look upon God in <hi>another method,</hi> and
take up better thoughts of him and his Providences, even while
they carry the appearance of Severity, they can expect no eaſe to
their complainings. For before the Prophet quitted himſelf of
his trouble, he was forced to acknowledge <hi>his miſtake (ver. 10.)</hi> in
the miſconſtruction he made of his dealings, and to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to a reſolve of entertaining better thoughts of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. His
Interrogation, <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever,</hi> &amp;c? ſhews indeed
what he did once think, being miſled by Satan, but withal that
he would never do ſo again, <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever?</hi> Is not
here the Voice of a deſpairing Man? but of one that through bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
information hath <hi>rectified</hi> his Judgment, and now is reſolved
ſtrongly to hold <hi>the contrary</hi> to what he thought before, as if he
ſhould ſay, <hi>'Tis not poſſible that it ſhould be ſo, he will not caſt off for
ever, and I will never entertain ſuch perverſe thoughts of God any more.</hi>
6. But before they can come to this, it will coſt them ſome
pains and ſerious thoughts; 'tis not eaſy to break theſe Fetters, to
anſwer this Argument; but they that will do ſo, muſt <hi>appeal</hi> from
their preſent ſence, to a conſideration <hi>of the iſſues</hi> of theſe dealings
upon <hi>other Perſons,</hi> or upon themſelves at <hi>other times:</hi> for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
ver. 5. <hi>conſidered the days of old, and the years of ancient times;</hi>
and <hi>ver.</hi> 6, he alſo made uſe of his own experience, calling <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi>
that after ſuch dealings as theſe, God by his return of
favour gave him <hi>Songs in the Night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Another common head from whence this great Diſputant
doth fetch his Arguments againſt the good condition and ſtate of
God's Servants, is their <hi>ſin and miſcarriages.</hi> Here I ſhall obſerve
two or three things in the general concerning this, before I ſhew
how he draws his falſe Concluſions from thence. As,</p>
                     <p>1. That with a kind of <hi>feigned ingenuity,</hi> he will grant a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt <hi>Sin and Sin,</hi> betwixt Sins reigning, and not reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Sins mortified, and not mortified: betwixt the Sins of the
Converted, and the Unconverted: and upon this ſuppoſition he
uſually proceeds. He doth not always (except in caſe of <hi>great
Sins)</hi> argue want of Regeneration from <hi>one Sin</hi> for that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:49412:192"/>
                        <hi>This is a Sin, therefore thou art not a Convert,</hi> would be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
anſwered, by one that knows the Saints have their imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
but he thus deals with Men: <hi>Theſe Sins whereof thou art
guilty, are reigning Sins,</hi> ſuch as are inconſiſtent with a converted
eſtate, and therefore thou art yet unregenerated.</p>
                     <p>2. He produceth uſually for the backing of his Arguments, ſuch
Scriptures as do <hi>truly</hi> repreſent the ſtate of Men <hi>unſanctified;</hi> but
then his labour is to make the Parties to appear <hi>ſuitable</hi> to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Unregenerate. And to that purpoſe he <hi>aggravates</hi>
all their failings to them: he makes ſevere enquiries after all their
Sins, and if he can charge them with any <hi>notorious</hi> crime, he lays
load upon that, ſtill concluding that a Regenerate Perſon doth not
ſin at ſuch a rate as they do.</p>
                     <p>3. This is always a very <hi>difficult</hi> caſe; 'tis not eaſy to anſwer
the objections that he will urge from hence: for 1. if there be
the real guilt of any <hi>grievous</hi> or remarkable ſcandal which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
the accuſed Party (though never ſo knowing, or (former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
never ſo holy) will be hardly put to it to determine any thing
in favour of his eſtate. 1. The <hi>Fact</hi> cannot be denyed. 2. The
Scripture nominates <hi>particularly</hi> ſuch offences, as render a Man
unfit for the Kingdom of God. 3. Whether in ſuch caſes, Grace
be not <hi>wholly</hi> loſt, is a <hi>queſtion</hi> in which all are not agreed. 4. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it will be very doubtful whether ſuch had <hi>ever</hi> any Grace. The
Scripture hath given <hi>no note</hi> of difference, to diſtinguiſh betwixt a
Regenerate and Unregenerate Perſon, <hi>In the acts</hi> of Murther, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
Fornication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It doth not ſay the Regenerate commits
an act of groſs Iniquity <hi>in this manner,</hi> the Unregenerate <hi>in that,</hi>
and that there is a <hi>viſible</hi> diſtinction betwixt the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar,
relating to theſe <hi>very Acts.</hi> And whatever may be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be the <hi>inward</hi> workings of Grace in the Soul, while 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to ſo <hi>narrow</hi> a compaſs, as a ſpark of Fire raked up in Aſhes,
yet the <hi>weight</hi> of preſent guilt upon the Soul (when 'tis charged
home) will always <hi>poiſe</hi> it toward the <hi>worſt</hi> apprehenſions that
can be made concerning its ſtate. <hi>Former</hi> acts of Holineſs will be
diſowned under the notion of Hypocriſy; or if yet owned to be
true, they will be apt to think that true Grace may be <hi>utterly loſt.
Preſent</hi> acts of Grace they can ſee none, ſo that only the <hi>after-acts</hi> of
Repentance can diſcover that there is yet a being and life of Grace
in them, and <hi>till then</hi> they can never anſwer Satans Argument
from great Sins. But, 2. In the <hi>uſual infirmities</hi> of God's Children
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:49412:192"/>
the caſe is not <hi>ſo eaſy.</hi> For the Scriptures give inſtances of ſome,
whoſe Converſations could not be taxed with any notorious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils;
who though they were <hi>not far from the Kingdom of God,</hi> yet
were not <hi>of the Kingdom of God:</hi> a freedom then from <hi>great Sins.</hi>
is not pleadable, as an <hi>undoubted mark</hi> of Grace. And if others
that are <hi>not converted,</hi> may have no greater infirmites than ſome
<hi>that are,</hi> the <hi>difference</hi> betwixt the one and the other muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the <hi>ſecret</hi> Powers of Grace, giving check to theſe infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and ſtriving to mortify them: And this will be an <hi>intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi>
queſtion. The Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. notes indeed <hi>three</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
betwixt the Regenerate and Unregenerate, in this caſe of
Sins of Infirmity. 1. <hi>Hatred</hi> of the Sin <hi>before</hi> the commiſſion of
it; <hi>What I hate, that do I. 2. Reluctancy in the Act: what I would,
that do I not. 3. Diſallowance after the Act: that which I do, I allow
not.</hi> Yet ſeeing natural Light will afford ſome <hi>appearances</hi> of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowance,
and reluctancy, it will ſtill admit of further debate,
Whether the <hi>Principles, Motives, Degrees</hi> and <hi>Succeſs</hi> of theſe ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
be ſuch as may diſcover the Being and Power of real
Grace.</p>
                     <p>While Satan doth inſiſt upon Arguments from the Sins of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
for the proof of an unconverted eſtate, he only aims to
make good this point, That <hi>their</hi> Sins are <hi>reigning</hi> Sins, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that they cannot be in ſo good a condition as they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to think. And to make their Sins to carry that appearance,
his conſtant courſe is to <hi>aggravate</hi> them all he can: this is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
and the means by which he would effect it. His great <hi>Art</hi> in
this caſe, is to heighten the Sins of the Regenerate; this he doth
many ways. As,</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>From the</hi> nature <hi>of the Sin committed, and the</hi> manner <hi>of
its commiſſion: and this he chiefly labours, becauſe his Arguments
from hence are more probable, eſpecially conſidering what he fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon uſually, is that which may moſt favour his Concluſion. A
1. If any have faln into a</hi> great Sin, <hi>which a Child of God doth but</hi>
rarely <hi>commit, then he argues againſt him, thus:</hi> They that are in
Chriſt, do mortify the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts, they caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the works of Darkneſs: and theſe works of the Fleſh are manifeſt,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19. Adultery, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Laſciviouſneſs, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Becauſe of
theſe things cometh the Wrath of God upon the Children of Diſobedience.
Be not therefore partakers with them, have no fellowſhip with the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:49412:193"/>
works of Darkneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 6, 11. But thou haſt not put theſe away,
nor mortified them, as thy preſent Sin doth teſtify, therefore thou art no
Child of God. 2. <hi>If any do more than once or twice</hi> relapſe <hi>into
the ſame Sin, (ſuppoſe it be not ſo highly ſcandalous as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
then he pleads from thence, that they are</hi> back-ſliders in
Heart, <hi>that they have</hi> broken their Covenant <hi>with God, that they are</hi>
in bondage <hi>to Sin. Here he urgeth, it may be, that of 2 Pet. 2. 19,
20.</hi> Of whom a Man is overcome, of the ſame is he brought in bondage;—
The Dog is returned to his Vomit. 3. <hi>Or if any have by any offence,
more remarkably gone</hi> againſt their Knowledg, <hi>or</hi> violated <hi>their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
then he tells them, that</hi> they ſin wilfully, that they reject the
Counſel of the Lord, that they are the Servants of Sin; for his Servants
ye are to whom ye obey. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. And that where there is Grace,
though they may fall, yet it is ſtill againſt their wills, <hi>&amp;c. 4. If he have
not ſo clear ground to manage any of the former charges againſt
them, then he argues from the</hi> frequency <hi>of their</hi> various <hi>miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Here he ſets their Sins</hi> in order <hi>before them,</hi> rakes <hi>them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that he may oppreſs them by a</hi> multitude, <hi>when he cannot
prevail by an accuſation from one or two acts: and his pleading
here is,</hi> Thou art nothing but Sin, thy thoughts are evil continually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy
words are vain and unprofitable, thy actions fooliſh and wicked, and this
in all thy imployments, in all relations, at all times. What duty is there
that is not neglected or defiled? what Sin that is not ſome way or other
committed? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Can ſuch an Heart as thine be the Temple of the
Holy Ghoſt? For the Temple of the Lord is Holy, and his People are
waſhed and cleanſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are all of them ſtrong objections, and frequently made uſe
of by Satan, as the complaints of the Servants of God do teſtify,
who are made thus to except againſt themſelves; <hi>If our Sins were
but the uſual failings of the converted, we might comfort our ſelves, but
they are great, they are back-ſlidings, they are againſt Conſcience, they
are many; what can we judge, but that we have hitherto deceived our
ſelves, and that the work of converſion is yet to do?</hi> The Objections
that are from <hi>great</hi> Sins, or from <hi>recidivation,</hi> or wilful <hi>violation</hi> of
Conſcience, do uſually prevail for <hi>ſome time,</hi> againſt the beſt that
are chargable with them; they cannot determine that they <hi>are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi>
(though they might be ſo,) ſo long as they cannot deny the
<hi>matter of Fact</hi> upon which the accuſation is grounded; till their
<hi>true repentance</hi> give them ſome light of better information, they are
in the dark and cannot anſwer the Argument. <hi>Jonah</hi> being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:49412:193"/>
in the Whales Belly, for his ſtubborn rebellion, at <hi>firſt</hi>
concluded himſelf a Caſt-away: Jon. 2. 4. <hi>Then I ſaid I amccaſt out of
thy Sight:</hi> Neither could he think better of himſelf, till upon his
<hi>Repentance,</hi> he recovered his Faith and Hope of Pardon, <hi>Yet will I
look again toward thy Holy Temple.</hi> Yea thoſe objections that are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from the <hi>multitude</hi> and <hi>frequency</hi> of leſſer failings, though they
may be anſwered by a Child of God, while his Heart is not <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed</hi>
with the Miſts and Clouds of Temptation, yet when he
is confuſed with violent commotions within, his Heart will fail
him, and till he can bring himſelf to ſome <hi>compoſure</hi> of Spirit, he
hath not the <hi>boldneſs</hi> to aſſert his integrity. <hi>David</hi> was gravelled
with this Objection, Pſal. 40. 12. <hi>Innumerable evils have compaſſed
me about, mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able
to look up; they are more than the Hairs on my Head, therefore my Heart
faileth me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. He aggravates the ſinfulneſs of our condition, from the <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency</hi>
and <hi>violence</hi> of <hi>his own</hi> Temptations. 'Tis an uſual thing for
him to give a young Converts, <hi>inceſſant onſets</hi> of Temptation to Sin:
moſt commonly he works upon their <hi>natural conſtitution,</hi> he blows
the Coals that are not yet quite extinguiſhed, and that have grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
forwardneſs from their own inclination to kindle again; as
Luſt and Paſſion. The <hi>firſt motions</hi> of the one, (though it go no
further, than thoſe <hi>offers</hi> and riſings up in the Heart, and is there
<hi>damped,</hi> and kept down by the oppoſing principle of Grace) and
the <hi>occaſional out-breakings</hi> of the other, (which he provokes by a
diligent preparation of <hi>occaſion</hi> from without, and violent <hi>incitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
from within) furniſh him with ſufficient matter for his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
accuſations; and ſometimes (being as it were wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
of the advantages which our tempers give him, or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to find any ſuch forwardneſs to theſe evils in our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
as may more eminently ſerve his ends) he ſatisfies himſelf
to moleſt us with earneſt motions to <hi>any Sins</hi> indifferently; and all
this to make us believe, that Sin is not crucified in us. Which
ſome are more apt to believe, becauſe they obſerve their Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to theſe Sins, to importune them <hi>more,</hi> and with <hi>greater ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency</hi>
than they were wont to do before: and this doth yet the
more aſtoniſh them, becauſe they had high <hi>expectations</hi> that after
their converſion, Satan would <hi>fall before them,</hi> and their Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<hi>abate;</hi> that their natures ſhould be altered, and their natural
inclinations to theſe Sins <hi>wholly ceaſe:</hi> but now finding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:49412:194"/>
they are ready to cry out, (eſpecially when Satan violently
buffets them with this objection) <hi>We are yet in our Sins, and under
the dominion thereof; neither can it be that we are converted, becauſe we
find Sin more active and ſtirring than formerly; 'tis not then ſurely mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
in us, but lively and ſtrong.</hi> Though in this caſe it be very
plain that <hi>Temptations</hi> are only ſtrong, and <hi>Sin</hi> weak, and that
Grace is <hi>faithfully</hi> acting its part againſt the Fleſh, arguing, not
that Grace is ſo very <hi>weak,</hi> but that Satan is more <hi>buſy</hi> than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;
the Sins are not <hi>more</hi> than formerly, but the <hi>Light</hi> that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
them more is <hi>greater,</hi> and the <hi>Conſcience</hi> that reſents the
Temptation is more <hi>tender.</hi> Yet all this doth not at firſt give eaſe
to the fears that are now raiſed up in the Mind; they find Sin
<hi>working</hi> in them, their <hi>expectations</hi> of attaining a greater conqueſt
on a <hi>ſudden,</hi> and with greater <hi>eaſe,</hi> are <hi>diſappointed,</hi> (and the deſire
of having much, makes a Man think himſelf poor); and withal
they commonly labour under ſo much <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or perverſe <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity,</hi>
that they conclude they <hi>conſent</hi> to every thing which they
are <hi>tempted</hi> to, inſomuch that 'tis long before theſe Clouds do va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
and the afflicted brought to a right underſtanding of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>3. From ſome <hi>remarkable appearances</hi> of God, doth Satan aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
our ſinful condition. If God ſhew any notable act of <hi>Power,</hi>
he makes the Beams of that act <hi>reflect</hi> upon our <hi>unworthineſs</hi> with
a dazling Light. When <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw the Power of Chriſt in ſending
a great multitude of Fiſhes into his Net, (having laboured all
Night before and caught nothing) it gave ſo deep an impreſſion
to the conviction of his vileneſs, that he was ready to put Chriſt
from him as being altogether unfit for his Bleſſed Society, <hi>Depart</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>from me, for I am a ſinful Man.</hi> If God diſcover the
Glorious Splendor of his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> 'tis enough to make the holieſt
Saints (ſuch as <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah)</hi> to cry out they are <hi>undone,</hi> being
<hi>Men of unclean Lips,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 42. 6.</note> and to <hi>abhor themſelves in Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> The
like may be ſaid of any diſcovery of the reſt of the Glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of God.<note place="margin">Iſa. 6. 5.</note> Of all which Satan makes this advantage, that
the Parties tempted ſhould have ſo deep a conſideration of their
unworthineſs, as might induce them to believe, (as if it were by
a Voice from Heaven) that God <hi>prohibits</hi> them any approaches to
him, and that they have nothing to do to take Gods Name with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Mouths. And though theſe remarkable diſcoveries of
God (either by his acts of Power and Providence, or by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:49412:194"/>
impreſſions upon the Soul, in the height of contemplation)
have ordinarily <hi>great effects</hi> upon the Hearts of his Children, but
not of long continuance: yet where they ſtrike in with <hi>other</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
by which they were <hi>already</hi> ſtaggered as to their Intereſt
in God, they mightily ſtrengthen them, and are taken for no
leſs than Gods own determination of the queſtion againſt
them.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all the uſe that Satan makes of them; for from
hence he ſometimes hath the opportunity to raiſe <hi>new accuſations</hi>
againſt them, and to tax them with <hi>particular</hi> crimes, which in a
particular <hi>manner</hi> ſeem to prove them Unregenerate. For what
would ſeem to be a clearer Character of a Man dead in Treſpaſſes
and Sins, than a <hi>hard Heart,</hi> that can neither be ſenſible of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
nor Mercies? This he ſometimes chargeth upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, from the great <hi>diſproportion</hi> that they find in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
betwixt the <hi>little ſence</hi> that they ſeem to have (and that
which is <hi>diſproportionable,</hi> they reckon to be <hi>nothing,)</hi> and the <hi>vaſt
greatneſs</hi> of Gods Mercy or Holineſs. I have obſerved ſome to
complain of utter <hi>unthankfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>inſenſibleneſs</hi> of Heart (from
thence concluding confidently againſt themſelves) becauſe, when
God hath remarkably appeared for them, in deliverances from
dangers, or in unexpected kindneſſes, they could not render a
thankfulneſs that carried any proportion to the Mercy. While
they were in the higheſt <hi>admiration</hi> of the kindneſs, ſaying, <hi>What
ſhall I render to the Lord?</hi> they were quite out of the <hi>ſight</hi> of their
own ſence and feeling, and thought they returned <hi>nothing</hi> at all,
becauſe they returned nothing <hi>equivalent</hi> to what they had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Others I have known, who from the <hi>confuſion</hi> and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Spirit, when they have been overwhelmed with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
have poſitively determined themſelves to be <hi>ſenſleſs,</hi> ſtupid,
paſt feeling, hardened to deſtruction: when in both caſes any
might have ſeen the <hi>working</hi> of their Hearts to be an apparent <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction</hi>
to what Satan charged them withal. For they were not
<hi>unapprehenſive</hi> either of Mercies or Judgments; but on the contrary,
had only a <hi>greater ſence</hi> of them than they were able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.</p>
                     <p>4. To make full meaſure, Satan doth ſometimes aggravate
the miſcarriages of thoſe whom he intends to accuſe, by <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
their lives and actions with the <hi>holy Lives</hi> of ſome eminent
Servants of God, eſpecially ſuch as they have <hi>only</hi> heard of, and
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:49412:195"/>
not known perſonally. For ſo they have only their <hi>Vertues</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented,
without their <hi>failings.</hi> Here Satan takes a liberty of
declaming againſt them: and though he could never ſpare a Saint
a good word out of reſpect; yet, that others might be put out
of heart and hope, he will <hi>commend</hi> the holineſs, ſtrictneſs, care,
conſtancy of <hi>dead</hi> Saints to the Skies. And then he Queries, <hi>Art
thou ſuch an one? Canſt thou ſay thou art any thing like them, for a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Heart, a holy Life, a contempt of the World, a zeal for God, for good
Works, for patient Suffering?</hi> &amp;c. (All this while not a word of
their Weakneſſes). <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were the Servants of the Moſt
High: their Examples thou ſhouldſt follow, if thou expecteſt their Crown.
Had they any more Holineſs than they needed? And if thouhaſt not ſo
much, thou art nothing.</hi> What can Humility, Modeſty, and ſenſe of
Guilt, ſpeak in ſuch a caſe? They go away mourning, their Fears
increaſe upon them; and what God hath ſet before them (in
the Examples of his Servants) for the <hi>increaſe</hi> of their diligence,
they take to be as a <hi>Witneſs</hi> againſt them, to prove them Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
                     <p>5. The laſt part of Satan's Sophiſtry, is to leſſen their <hi>Graces,</hi>
that ſo he may altogether <hi>deny</hi> them. In this he proceeds upon
ſuch Scriptures, as do aſſert the Fruits of the Spirit; and urgeth
for his foundation, that none are the Children of God, but ſuch
as <hi>are led by the Spirit;</hi> and that <hi>he that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt,
is none of his.</hi> The <hi>neceſſity</hi> of Faith, Love, Patience, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
with the Fruits of theſe and other Graces, he <hi>preſſeth;</hi> but
ſtill in order to a Demonſtration (as he pretends) that ſuch are
<hi>not to be found</hi> in thoſe, whoſe Gracious ſtate he calls into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and conſequently that they are not the Children of
God.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Rule</hi> by which he manageth himſelf in this Diſpute, is
this: <hi>The more Graces are heightned in the Notions, that muſt give an
account of their Nature and Beings; the more difficult it will be to
find out their Reality in the Practice of them.</hi> His deſign then hath
theſe <hi>two</hi> parts. 1. He <hi>heightens</hi> Grace in the <hi>Notion,</hi> or Abſtract,
all he can. 2. He <hi>leſſens</hi> it in the Concrete, or <hi>Practice,</hi> as much
as is poſſible, that it may appear a very Nullity, a ſhadow and not
a ſubſtance. I ſhall ſpeak a little of both.</p>
                     <p>1. As to the <hi>firſt part</hi> of his Deſign, he hath many ways by
which he <hi>aggravates</hi> Grace in the Notion. We may be ſure if it
lie in his way, he will not ſtick to give <hi>falſe definitions</hi> of Grace;
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:49412:195"/>
and to tell Men that it is, what indeed it is not. He is a Lyar, and
in any caſe whatſoever he will lie for his <hi>advantage,</hi> if he have
hope his Lye may paſs for current; but he cannot always uſe a
<hi>palpable Cheat</hi> in this matter, where the nature of any Grace is
poſitively determined in Scripture, except it be with the <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi>
or where the nature of Grace is made a buſineſs of <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie</hi>
among Men. I will not make Conjectures what Satan
may poſſibly ſay, in belying the nature of Grace, to make it ſeem
to be quite another thing than it is; but ſhall rather ſhew you
the more uſual plauſible ways of Deceit which herein he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth;
and they are theſe that follow.</p>
                     <p>1. As the ſame Graces have different <hi>Degrees</hi> in ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and theſe different Degrees have <hi>Operations</hi> ſuitable; ſome
Acts being ſtronger, ſome weaker, ſome more perfected and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
others more imperfect, and immature: So when Satan
comes to deſcribe Grace, he ſets it forth in its <hi>higheſt Excellencies,</hi>
and moſt glorious Attainments. You ſhall never obſerve him
to ſpeak of Graces at their <hi>loweſt pitch,</hi> (except where he is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on a deſign for <hi>Preſumption,</hi> and then he tells Men that any
<hi>Wiſhing,</hi> or <hi>Woulding</hi> is Grace; and every formal <hi>[Lord forgive
me]</hi> is true Repentance): but on the contrary he offers the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
reach of it, that any Saint on Earth ever arrived at, as <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi>
neceſſary to conſtitute its <hi>Being;</hi> and tells them if they have
not <hi>that,</hi> they have <hi>nothing.</hi> Let us ſee it in the Particulars.
1. Grace ſometimes hath its <hi>Extraordinaries;</hi> (as I may call
them.) We have both Precept and Example of that nature in
Scripture, which are propounded not as the <hi>common Standard</hi> by
which the Being and <hi>Reality</hi> of Grace is to be meaſured, but as
<hi>Patterns</hi> for imitation, to provoke us to Emulation; and to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
us in preſſing forward. Of this nature I reckon to be the
Example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> deſiring to be blotted <hi>out of God's Book</hi>
(whatever he meant by it) in his love to the People; and the
like of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> wiſhing himſelf to be <hi>accurſed from Chriſt
for his Brethrens ſake.</hi> Of this nature alſo we have many Precepts;
as <hi>rejoyce evermore,</hi> of <hi>waiting</hi> and <hi>longing</hi> for the Appearance of
Chriſt, of <hi>rejoycing</hi> when we <hi>fall into divers Temptations;</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more to this purpoſe, All which are heights of Grace that
do <hi>rarely</hi> appear among the Servants of God, at any time.
2. Grace hath ſometimes its <hi>ſpecial Aſſiſtances;</hi> this is when the
occaſion is <hi>extraordinary,</hi> but the Grace befitting that occaſion is
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:49412:196"/>
promiſed <hi>in ordinary,</hi> and ordinarily recieved. When God calls
any to ſuch occaſions, though compared with that <hi>meaſure of
Grace,</hi> which uſually is acted by the Children of God upon ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
occaſions; it is a ſpecial aſſiſtance of the Spirit. Of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is that <hi>Boldneſs</hi> which the Servants of Chriſt receive, to
<hi>confeſs</hi> Chriſt before Men in times of Perſecution, and to <hi>Die</hi> for
the Truth, with Conſtancy, Courage, and Joy. 3. There are
alſo ſingular <hi>Eminencies</hi> of Grace, which ſome diligent, careful,
and <hi>choice</hi> Servants of God attain unto, far above what the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſort</hi> arrive at. <hi>Enoch</hi> had his Converſation ſo much in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that he was ſaid to <hi>walk with God. David</hi>'s Soul was often
full of <hi>delight</hi> in God. Some in the height of Aſſurance, rejoyce
in God, with <hi>joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory. Moſes</hi> was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in <hi>Meekneſs; Job</hi> in <hi>Patience;</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Zeal,</hi> for
promoting the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now Satan, when he comes to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
the Graces of Men, he preſents them with theſe Meaſures;
and if they fall ſhort, (as ordinarily they do) he concludes them
altogether Graceleſs.</p>
                     <p>2. Satan alſo can do much to heighten the <hi>ordinary work,</hi> and
uſual fruits of <hi>every</hi> Grace. His Art herein, lies in two things.
1. He gives us a deſcription of Grace as it is <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> abſtracted
from the Weakneſs, Dulneſs, Diſtraction, and Infirmities that
are Concomitant with it, as it comes forth to Practice. He brings
to our view Grace in its <hi>Glory,</hi> and without the <hi>Spots</hi> by which
our Weakneſs, and Satan's Temptation, do much <hi>disfigure</hi> it.
2. He preſents us with Grace in its <hi>whole Body,</hi> compleated with
all its Members, Faith, Love, Hope, Patience, Meekneſs, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> From both theſe, he ſets before thoſe whom he
intends to diſcourage, a compleat <hi>Copy</hi> of an <hi>exact</hi> holy Chriſtian:
As if every true Chriſtian were to be found in the <hi>conſtant</hi> Practice
of <hi>all theſe Graces at all times,</hi> on <hi>all occaſions,</hi> and that without
weakneſs or Infirmity. Whereas indeed, a true Chriſtian may
be found ſometimes <hi>evidently</hi> practiſing <hi>one</hi> Grace, and weak, or
at preſent <hi>defective in another.</hi> And ſometimes the beſt of his
Graces is ſo <hi>interrupted</hi> with Temptation, ſo <hi>clogged</hi> with Infirmity,
that its workings are ſcarce <hi>diſcernable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. He hath a Policy in heightning thoſe <hi>Attainments</hi> and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Soul, in things relating to God and Religion, which are
to be found in <hi>Temporary Believers;</hi> which becauſe they ſometimes
appear in the Unconverted, as well as in the Converted, (though
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:49412:196"/>
all Unconverted Men have them not) are therefore called <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
Graces. This he doth that he may from thence take occaſion
to <hi>diſprove</hi> the <hi>Real</hi> Graces of the Servants of God; of whom <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things, and things that accompany Salvation</hi> (that is ſpecial ſaving
Graces) are to be expected, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 9. His way herein is, 1. To
ſhew the utmoſt <hi>bravery</hi> of theſe Common Graces, how much Men
may have, how far they may go, and yet at laſt come to nothing.
For <hi>Gifts</hi> they may have powerful <hi>Eloquence, Prophecy,</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Myſteries,</hi> faith of <hi>Miracles.</hi> For <hi>good Works;</hi> they may
give their <hi>Eſtates to relieve the Poor:</hi> In <hi>Moral Vertues,</hi> they may
be Excellent, their <hi>Illumination</hi> may be great; they may <hi>taſte the
good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come,</hi> Heb.
6. 4. Their Converſation may be <hi>without offence,</hi> and their
Conſcience <hi>Honeſt,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi>'s was before his Converſion.
2. With theſe <hi>heights</hi> of common Grace, he compares the <hi>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
degree</hi> of Special Grace. And becauſe the <hi>Principles, Motives,</hi>
and <hi>Ends,</hi> which conſtitute the difference betwixt theſe two, are
(as it were) <hi>under-ground,</hi> more remote from Senſe and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and oftentimes darkned by Temptation: He takes the
boldneſs to deny the Truth of Grace, upon the account of the
ſmall inconſiderable <hi>appearance</hi> that it makes, confidently affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that Special Grace muſt of neceſſity make a far greater <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhew</hi> than theſe Common Graces. In what manner, and
to what end, Satan doth <hi>heighten Grace</hi> in the <hi>abſtract</hi> we have
ſeen: It remains that we diſcover,</p>
                     <p>2. How he doth <hi>leſſen</hi> Grace in the <hi>Concrete;</hi> this is the center
of his Deſign. He would not extol Grace ſo much, but that he
hopes thereby to <hi>condemn the Generation of the Juſt,</hi> and to make
it appear, that there are <hi>few</hi> or <hi>none,</hi> that are truly Gracious.
When he comes to apply all this to the condition of any Child of
God, he deals treacherouſly; and his cunning conſiſts of three
Parts.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>He compares the</hi> preſent ſtate <hi>of any one, with whom he
deals, to the</hi> higheſt <hi>attainments and excellencies of Grace; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
nothing to be Grace, but what will anſwer theſe Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he had already given. Here the Tempter doth apparently
make uſe of a</hi> falſe Ballance, <hi>and</hi> a Bag of deceitful Weights. <hi>For
thus he puts them to it:</hi> Thou ſayeſt thou haſt Grace, but thou doſt
altogether deceive thy ſelf, for indeed thou haſt none at all. Compare
thy ſelf with others, that were in Scripture noted, as undoubtedly
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:49412:197"/>
Gracious, and thou wilt ſee that in the Ballance, thou art lighter than
Vanity. <hi>Abraham</hi> had Faith, but he believed above hope. <hi>Moſes</hi>
and <hi>Paul</hi> had love, but they manifeſted it by preferring their Brethrens
happineſs before their own. <hi>David</hi> was a Saint, but he had a Heart
raviſhed with God. The Martyrs ſpoken of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. they could do
Wonders; they were above fears of Men, above the love of the World;
they loved not their Lives to the Death: How joyfully took they the ſpoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Goods? How couragiouſly did they ſuffer the ſharpeſt Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
Beſides <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> all the Children of God are deſcribed is San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
throughout, abounding with all fruits of Righteouſneſs; their Faith
is Working; their Love ſtill Laborious; their Hope produceth conſtant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:
What art thou to theſe? That in thee which thou calleſt Faith,
or Love, or Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis not fit to be named with theſe: Thy fears
may tell thee, that thou haſt no Faith, and ſo may thy Works; thy
murmurings under God's Hand is evidence ſufficient, that thou haſt no
Patience. The little that thou doſt for God, or eſpecially wouldſt do,
if it were not for thy own advantage, may convince thee that thou haſt
no love to him; thy wearineſs of Services and Duties thy confeſſed
unprofitableneſs under all, do proclaim thou haſt no delight in God, nor
in his Ways. <hi>He further adds, for the confirmation of all this:</hi>
Conſider how far Temporaries may go, that ſhall never go to Heaven.
Thou art far ſhort of them; thy Gifts, thy Works, thy Vertues, thy
Illumination, thy Converſation, thy Conſcientiouſneſs are nothing like
theirs: How is it poſſible then that ſuch as one as thou (a pittiful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Creature) ſhouldſt have any thing of true Grace in thee?
<hi>Thus he makes the Application of all the Diſcovery of Grace,
which he preſented to them. Though he needs not urge</hi> all <hi>theſe
things to every one, any one of theſe particulars frequently ſerves
the turn. When a trembling Heart compares it ſelf with theſe
Inſtances, it turns its Back, yields the Argument, and is aſhamed
of its former Hopes, as thoſe are of their former Confidence, who
flee from Battel. Hence then do we hear of theſe various Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints:
One ſaith,</hi> Alas! I have no Grace, becauſe I live not as other
Saints have done in all exactneſs. <hi>Another ſaith,</hi> I have no Faith,
becauſe I cannot believe above Reaſon, and contrary to Senſe, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
did. <hi>A third crys out,</hi> He hath no Love to God, becauſe he cannot
find his Soul raviſhed with deſire after him. <hi>Another thinks,</hi> He hath
a hard Heart, becauſe he cannot weep for Sin. <hi>Another concludes
againſt himſelf, becauſe</hi> He finds not a preſent chearful reſolve <hi>(while
he is not under any queſtion for Religion)</hi> to ſuffer Torments for
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:49412:197"/>
Chriſt. <hi>Some fear themſelves,</hi> Becauſe Temporaries in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
have much out-gone them. <hi>You ſee how Complaints may upon
this ſcore, be multiplied without end; and yet all this is but Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.
Satan tells them what Grace is at the</hi> higheſt, <hi>but not a
word of what it is at</hi> loweſt: <hi>And ſo</hi> unskilful <hi>is a toſſed, weak
Chriſtian, that he in examining his Condition, looks after the</hi>
higheſt Degrees <hi>of Grace (as affording clearer Evidence) and not
after the</hi> Sincerity <hi>of it; which is the ſafeſt way for Trial, where
Graces are weak. In a word, this kind of Arguing is no better
than that of Children, who cannot conclude themſelves to be</hi>
Men, <hi>becauſe their preſent ſtature is</hi> little, <hi>and they are not as
tall as the Adult.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Another part of his cunning in leſſening the real Graces of
God's Children, is to take them at an advantage, when their
Graces are <hi>weakeſt,</hi> and themſelves moſt <hi>out of order.</hi> He that
will chuſe to meaſure a Man's Stature while he is upon his Knees,
ſeems not to deſign to give a faithful account of his Height. No
more doth Satan, who, when he will make Compariſons, always
takes the Servants of God at the worſt. And indeed, many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
do the Children of God give him, inſomuch that it is
no wonder that he doth ſo oft Baffle them, but rather a wonder
that they at any time return to their Comforts. 1. Sometimes
he takes them to task while they are yet <hi>young and tender,</hi> when
they are but newly converted, before their Graces are grown up,
or have had time to put forth any conſiderable Fruit. 2. Or
when their Graces are <hi>tired out,</hi> by long or grievous aſſaults of
Temptation; for then they are not what they are at other times.
3. When their Hearts are <hi>diſcompoſed,</hi> or <hi>muddied</hi> with fear; for
then their ſight is bad, and they can ſo little judg of things that
differ, that Satan can impoſe almoſt any thing upon them.
4. Sometimes he comes upon them, when ſome Grace <hi>acts</hi> his
part but <hi>poorly</hi> (as not having its <hi>perfect work)</hi> and is ſcarce able
to get through, ſticking as it were in the Birth. 5. Or when the
<hi>progreſs</hi> of Grace is ſmall and <hi>imperceptible.</hi> 6. Or while in the
<hi>abſence</hi> of the Sun (which produceth Flowers, and Fragrancy, and
is the time of the <hi>ſinging of Birds,</hi> Cant. 2. 11, 12.) it is forced
to caſt off its <hi>Summer Fruits</hi> of Joy, and ſenſible Delights; and
only produceth <hi>Winter Fruits,</hi> of Lamenting after God, Longing
and Panting after him, juſtifying of God in his Dealings, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
it ſelf; all this while <hi>ſowing in Tears,</hi> for a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:49412:198"/>
Crop. 7. Or while <hi>Expectations</hi> are more than <hi>Enjoyments,</hi>
the Man it may be promiſed himſelf large incomes of greater
meaſures of Comforts, Eaſe, or Strength, under ſome particular
Ordinances, or Helps which he hath lately attained to; and not
finding things preſently to anſwer what he hoped for, is now ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitious
of his caſe, and thinks he hath attained nothing, becauſe
he hath not what he would. 8. Sometimes Satan ſhews them his
Face in this Glaſs, when 'tis <hi>fouleſt,</hi> through the ſpots of ſome
Miſcarriage. 9. Or he takes advantage of ſome <hi>Natural Defects,</hi>
as want of <hi>Tears,</hi> which might be more uſual in former times,
but are now dried up; or from the <hi>Ebbings</hi> and uncertainty of his
A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ections, which are never ſure rules of Trials. 10. Or in ſuch
acts that are of a <hi>mixed</hi> nature in the Principles and Motives,
where it may ſeem to be <hi>uncertain</hi> to which the <hi>Act</hi> muſt be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
as to the <hi>true</hi> Parent. The Heart of a gracious Perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
challenged upon any of theſe Points, and under ſo great a
Diſadvantage, being called out to give a proof of himſelf, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the view of Grace ſet forth in all its Excellency and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ſhall have little to plead, but will rather own the Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And the rather, becauſe</p>
                     <p>3. It is another part of Satan's cunning, to urge them (whilſt
they are thus at a ſtand) with a <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> nay, a <hi>Probability</hi> of
their <hi>miſtaking</hi> themſelves, by paſſing too favourable an opinion
formerly of their Actions. To confirm them in this apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
1. He lays before them the conſideration of the <hi>deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of the Heart,<note place="margin">J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r. 17. 6.</note> which (being ſo, above all things, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
wicked, beyond ordinary diſcovery) makes a fair way for
the entertainment of a ſuſpition of <hi>Self-deluſion</hi> in all the former
hopes which a Man hath had of himſelf. Satan will plainly ſpeak
it: <hi>Thou haſt had ſome thoughts and workings of Mind towards
God, but ſeeing they carry ſo great a diſproportion to Rule and Examp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
and come ſo far ſhort of Common Graces; 'tis more than probable,
that ſuch poor, weak, confuſed appearances are nothing. How know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thou that thine adherence to, and practice of the Command and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of God are any more, than from the power of Education, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency
of Cuſtom, or the impreſſions of Moral ſwaſion? How doſt thou
know that thy deſires after God, and thy delight in him, are any more
than the products of Natural Principles, influenced by an Hiſtorical
faith of Scripture Doctrine?</hi> 'Tis oftentimes enough for Satan to
hint this: A ſuſpitious Heart (as it were greedy of its own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery)
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:49412:198"/>
catcheth at all things that make againſt it: and hence
complains; That it hath no Grace becauſe it ſees not any viſible
Fruits, or makes not a ſufficient appearance at all times, when
oppoſed, or reſiſted; or becauſe it wants ſenſible progreſs, or
gives not the Summer Fruits of Praiſes, Rejoycings, and Delights
in God; or becauſe it ſeems not to meet with remarkable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
in Ordinances; or becauſe it cannot produce Tears,
and raiſe the Affections; and becauſe the Party doth not know
but his Heart might decieve him, in all that he hath done. Which
the Devil yet further endeavoureth to confirm, 2. By a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the <hi>ſeeming</hi> Holineſs and Graces of ſuch, as believed
themſelves to be the Children of God, and were generally by
others reputed ſo to be; who yet, after a glorious profeſſion,
turned Apoſtates. This being ſo great and undeniable an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Hearts deceitfulneſs, makes the poor tempted Party
conclude, that he is certainly no true Convert.</p>
                     <p>Thus have we ſeen Satan's Sophiſtry in the management of
thoſe five grand Topicks, from whence he draws his falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
againſt the Children of God, pretending to prove that
they are <hi>not Converted;</hi> or at leaſt, if they be in a ſtate of Grace,
that they in that ſtate, are in a very bad <hi>unſuitable</hi> condition to it.
(For if his Arguments fall ſhort of the <hi>firſt,</hi> they ſeldom miſs the
<hi>latter</hi> mark.) This was his firſt Engine. Now follows.</p>
                     <p>2. The other Engine by which he fixeth theſe Concluſions,
which though it be not <hi>Argumentative,</hi> yet it ſerves to <hi>ſharpen</hi> all
his Fallacies againſt the Comforts of God's Children; this is
<hi>fear,</hi> which together with his Objections he ſends into the Mind.
That Satan can raiſe a ſtorm and commotion in the Heart by fear,
hath been proved before. I ſhall now only in a few things ſhew,
how he doth <hi>forward</hi> his deſign, by aſtoniſhing the Heart with
his frightful thundrings.</p>
                     <p>1. His Objections being accompanied with <hi>Affrightments,</hi> they
paſs for <hi>ſtrong</hi> undeniable Arguments, and their Fallacy is not ſo
eaſily detected. Fear, as well as Anger, <hi>darkens</hi> Reaſon, and
diſables the Underſtanding to make a true faithful <hi>ſearch</hi> into
things, or to give a right <hi>judgment:</hi> As Darkneſs deceives the
Senſes, and makes every Buſh affrightful to the Paſſenger; or as
muddied Waters hinder the ſight: ſo do Fears in the Heart diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Man to diſcover the ſillieſt Cheat that Satan can put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="374" facs="tcp:49412:199"/>
2. They are alſo very <hi>Credulous.</hi> When Fear is up, any Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
takes place. As ſuſpitious <hi>Incredulity</hi> is an effect of <hi>Joy,</hi> (the
Diſciples at firſt hearing that Chriſt was riſen, <hi>for Joy believed it
not)</hi> ſo ſuſpitious <hi>Credulity</hi> is the effect of <hi>Fear.</hi> And we ſhall
obſerve ſeveral things in the Servants of God, that ſhew a ſtrange
Inclination, as it were a <hi>Natural aptitude</hi> to believe the evil of
their Spiritual Eſtate which Satan ſuggeſts to them. As 1. There is
a great forwardneſs, and <hi>Precipitancy</hi> in the Heart, to cloſe with evil
Thoughts raiſed up in us. When jealouſies of God's Love are
injected, there is a violent <hi>Haſtineſs,</hi> forthwith (all calm deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
being laid aſide) to entertain a belief of it. This is
more than once noted in the <hi>Pſalms.</hi> In this caſe, <hi>David</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
this haſty Humour; <hi>I ſaid in my haſte,</hi> Pſal. 31. 22. and
Pſal. 116. 11. This haſty forwardneſs to determine things that
are againſt us, without due examination, <hi>Aſaph</hi> calls a great
weakneſs; <hi>This is my Infirmity,</hi> Pſal. 77. 10. 2. There is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
in thoſe that are under Spiritual Troubles, a great kind of
<hi>Delight,</hi> (if I may ſo call it) to hear <hi>Threatnings</hi> rather than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes;
and ſuch Diſcourſes as ſet forth the miſery of a Natural
State, rather than ſuch as ſpeak of the Happineſs of the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Becauſe theſe things, in their apprehenſion, are more ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their Condition, and more needful for them, in order to a
<hi>greater</hi> meaſure of Humiliation, which they ſuppoſe to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
However, thus they add fuel to the Flame. 3. They have
an aptitude to <hi>hide themſelves</hi> from Comfort, and with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
nimbleneſs of Wit and Reaſoning, to evade, and anſwer
any Argument brought for their Comfort; as if they had been
Volunteers in Satans ſervice, to fight againſt themſelves. 4. They
have alſo ſo great a <hi>blaſting</hi> upon their Underſtanding, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
<hi>tempting</hi> them to doubt of their good Eſtate, is to them a
ſufficient <hi>reaſon</hi> to doubt of it; and that is Ground enough for
them to <hi>deny</hi> it, becauſe Satan <hi>queſtions</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>3. Theſe Fears make all Satan's ſuggeſtions ſtrike the <hi>deeper,</hi>
they point all his Arrows, and make them pierce (as it were)
<hi>the Joynts and Marrow;</hi> they poyſon and envenom them to the
great <hi>increaſe</hi> of the Torment, and <hi>hinderance</hi> of the Cure; they
<hi>bind</hi> the Objections upon them, and <hi>confirm</hi> them in a certain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
that they are all true. We have now viewed Satan's Engines
and Batteries againſt the Servants of the Lord, for the deſtuction
of their Joy and Peace, by Spiritual Troubles; but theſe are but
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:49412:199"/>
the <hi>beginnings</hi> of ſorrows, if compared with thoſe diſtreſſes
of Soul, which he ſometimes brings upon them. Of which

                     <p>THe laſt ſort of Troubles by which Satan overthrows the
peace of the Soul, are <hi>Spiritual Diſtreſſes;</hi> theſe are more
<hi>grievous</hi> Agonies of Soul, under <hi>deepeſt</hi> apprehenſions of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Wrath,</hi> and <hi>dreadful</hi> Fears of everlaſting <hi>Damnation,</hi> differing
in <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>degree,</hi> from the former ſorts of Troubles; though in
theſe Satan obſerves much what the ſame General Method, which
he uſed in Spiritual Troubles laſt mentioned. For which cauſe, and
alſo that theſe are not ſo common as the other, I ſhall ſpeak of
them with greater Brevity. Herein I ſhall ſhew, 1. Their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
2. Satan's <hi>Method</hi> in working them. 3. Their <hi>Weight</hi> and
Burthen.</p>
                     <p>1. The Nature of Spiritual Diſtreſſes will be beſt diſcovered,
by a conſideration of thoſe <hi>Ingredients</hi> of which they are made
up, and of the different <hi>degrees</hi> thereof.</p>
                     <p>1. As to the Ingredients, there are ſeveral things that do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
for the begetting of theſe violent Diſtreſſes. As, 1. There
is uſually a <hi>Complication</hi> of ſeveral <hi>kinds</hi> of Troubles. Sometimes
there are <hi>outward</hi> Troubles, and <hi>inward</hi> diſcompoſures of Spirit
ariſing from thence; ſometimes <hi>Affrightments</hi> of blaſphemous
thoughts long continued, and uſually <hi>Spiritual</hi> Troubles (in
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:49412:200"/>
which their State or Condition have been called to queſtion)
have gone before. <hi>Heman</hi> (who is as famous an Inſtance in this
caſe, as any we meet withal in Scripture) in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. ſeems not
obſcurely to tell us ſo much; his <hi>Soul</hi> was <hi>full of troubles,</hi> ver. 3.
And in <hi>ver.</hi> 7. he complains that God had afflicted him <hi>with all his
Waves:</hi> And that theſe were not all of the ſame kind (though
all concurred to the ſame end) he himſelf Explains, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 18.
where he bemoans himſelf for the unkindneſs of his Friends:
<hi>Thou haſt put away mine Acquaintance; Lover and Friend haſt thou
put far from me.</hi> 2. Theſe Troubles drive at a <hi>further end</hi> than
any of the former; for their deſign was only againſt the <hi>preſent
Quietneſs</hi> and Peace of God's Children, but theſe deſign the <hi>ruine</hi>
of their hopes for the <hi>future;</hi> they are troubled, not for that they
are <hi>not Converted,</hi> but for that they expect <hi>never to be Converted.</hi> This
is a trouble of an high nature, making them believe that they are
<hi>eternally Reprobated,</hi> cut off from God for ever, and under an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility</hi>
of Salvation. 3. Theſe troubles have the <hi>conſent</hi> and
belief of the Party. In ſome other troubles Satan diſquieted the
Lords Servants, by <hi>impoſing</hi> upon them his own curſed ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
violently bearing in upon them temptations to Sin and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
or objections againſt their ſtate of Regeneration, while
in the mean time <hi>they oppoſed</hi> and refuſed to give conſent; but in
theſe Satan prevails with them, to believe that their caſe is really
ſuch as their Fears repreſent it to be. 4. They are Troubles of
a far higher <hi>degree</hi> than the former, the deepeſt Sorrows, the
ſharpeſt Fears, the greateſt Agonies. <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88. <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16.
calls them <hi>Terrours</hi> even to <hi>diſtraction: While I ſuffer thy Terrours,
I am diſtracted; thy fierce Wrath goeth over me, thy Terrours have cut
me off.</hi> 5. There is alſo God's <hi>deſerting</hi> of them in a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

1. Some are deſperate Terrours, of <hi>curſed Reprobates</hi> under
deſperation. Theſe terrours in them, are in the greateſt Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
the very Pit of Miſery, of the ſame nature with thoſe of
the Damned in Hell,<note place="margin">Ames <hi>caſes of Conſc.</hi> lib. 1. cap.</note> 
                        <hi>where the Worm that never dies,</hi> is nothing elſe
but the dreadful vexation and torment of an accuſing Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
They are commonly accompanied with <hi>Blaſpheming</hi> of
God, and an utter <hi>rejection</hi> of all means for Remedy; and though
they ſometimes turn to a kind of <hi>ſecure deſperation,</hi> (by which
(when they ſee it will be no better) they <hi>harden</hi> themſelves in
their Miſery, and ſeek to <hi>divert</hi> their Thoughts) as <hi>Cain</hi> did,
betaking himſelf to the Building of Cities. And <hi>Eſau,</hi> when
he had ſold his Birth-right, deſpiſed it, and gave himſelf up to
the purſuit of a Worldly intereſt; yet ſometimes theſe Terrours
end in <hi>Self-Murther,</hi> as in <hi>Judas,</hi> who being ſmitten with dread
of Conſcience, went and hanged himſelf. We have many ſad
Inſtances of theſe deſperate Terrours. <hi>Cain</hi> is the firſt we read
of, and though the account the Scriptures give of him be but
ſhort, yet 'tis ſufficient to let us ſee what his condition was, <hi>Gen.
4.</hi> 11. to 16. Firſt, He was <hi>curſed from the Earth.</hi> Of this part
of his Curſe, there were two Branches; 1. That his labour
and toyl in Tillage ſhould be <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>greatly</hi> unſucceſsful; for
thus God himſelf explains it, <hi>ver. 12. When thou tilleſt the Ground,
it ſhall not henceforth yield unto thee her ſtrength.</hi> The Earth was
curſed with Barrenneſs before to <hi>Adam,</hi> but now to <hi>Cain</hi> it hath
a <hi>double</hi> Curſe. 2. That he ſhould be a Man of uncertain abode
in any place; <hi>A Fugitive and a Vagabond ſhalt thou be in the
Earth:</hi> Not being able to ſtay long in a place, by reaſon of the
terrours of his Concience. His own interpretation of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.
ſhews, that herein lay a great part of his Miſery; <hi>Thou haſt dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me out this day from the face of the Earth.</hi> By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that he was to be as one that was chaſed out of all Society,
and as one that thought himſelf ſafe in no place. Secondly,
He was <hi>hid from the Face of God;</hi> that is, he was doomed to
carry the inward feeling of God's Wrath, without any expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mercy. Thirdly, His mind being terrified under the
apprehenſion of that Wrath, he crys out, That his <hi>Sin was greater</hi>
than it could be <hi>pardoned;</hi>

                           </gap>.</note> or that <hi>his Puniſhment</hi> was <hi>greater than
he could bear.</hi> (For the word in the Original, ſignifies both Sin,
and Puniſhment.) Take it which way you will, it expreſſeth
a deep horrour of Heart. If in the former ſenſe, then it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:49412:201"/>
a Conviction of the greatneſs of his ſin to <hi>Deſperation;</hi> if in
the latter ſenſe, then 'tis no leſs than a blaſphemous <hi>Reflection</hi>
upon God, as unjuſtly Cruel. Fourthly, This horrour was ſo
great, that he was afraid of all he met with, ſuſpecting every
thing to be armed with Divine Vengeance againſt him; <hi>every one
that findeth me, ſhall ſlay me.</hi> Or if that ſpeech was a deſire, that
any one that found him might Kill him,<note place="margin">Lightfoot Harm in loc.</note> (as ſome interpret) it
ſhews that he preferred Death before that life of Miſery. It
ſeems then, that God ſmote him with ſuch Terrour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation
of Mind, and with ſuch affrightful Trembling of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
for his bloody Fact, that he was weary of himſelf, and afraid
of all Men, and could not ſtay long in a Place. By theſe Tokens
(or ſome other way) God ſets his <hi>Mark</hi> upon him, as upon a
curſed Miſcreant, to be noted and abhorred of all. Such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inſtance was <hi>Lamech,</hi> of whom the ſame Chapter ſpeaks.
1. The ſting of Conſcience was ſo great, that he is <hi>forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs</hi>
his fault: (The interpretations of thoſe, that take it Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatively;
<hi>Have I ſlain?</hi> Or, <hi>If I have, what is that to you?</hi>
&amp;c. are upon many accounts improper; much more are thoſe
ſo, that take it Negatively). Which, whether it were the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of <hi>Poligamy,</hi> (as ſome think) by which Example he had
deſtroyed more than <hi>Cain</hi> did; or if it were <hi>Murther</hi> in a proper
ſenſe (as the Words and Context plainly carry it) 'tis not very
material to our purpoſe; however God ſmote him with Horrour,
that he might be a witneſs againſt himſelf. 2. He accuſeth
himſelf for a more grievous Sinner, and more deſperate Wretch
by far than <hi>Cain: If</hi> Cain (ver. 24.) <hi>ſhall be avenged ſeven-fold,
truly</hi> Lamech <hi>ſeventy and ſeven-fold.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay,
that there was as much difference 'twixt his Sin and <hi>Cain</hi>'s, as
betwixt ſeven, and ſeventy ſeven. 3. It ſeems alſo by his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to his Wives, that he was grievouſly perplexed with <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
fears;</hi> ſuſpecting (it may be) his very Wives (as well as
others) might have private Combinations againſt him, for the
prevention whereof, he tells them by <hi>Cain's</hi> example of God's
avenging him. Theſe two early examples of Deſperation the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World affords, and there have been many more
ſince, as <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi> Of late Years we have the Memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Inſtance of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> one of the cleareſt and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Examples of Spiritual Horrour, that the latter Ages
of the World were ever acquainted with; yet I ſhall not dare to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:49412:201"/>
be confident of his Reprobation, as of <hi>Cain</hi>'s and <hi>Judas</hi>'s, becauſe
the Scripture hath determined their caſe, but we have no ſuch
certain authority to determine his.</p>
                     <p>2. There are alſo Diſtreſſes from <hi>Melancholy,</hi> which may be
further differenced according to the intenſeneſs, or remiſneſs of
the Diſtemper upon which they depend. For ſometimes the
<hi>Imagination</hi> is ſo exceedingly depraved, the <hi>fears</hi> of Heart ſo
great, and the <hi>ſorrows</hi> ſo deep, that the Melancholy Perſon cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of himſelf, that he is Damned, under the Curſe of God,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> appears to be wholly <hi>beſides himſelf;</hi> and his Anguiſh to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, but a <hi>delirous irrational diſturbance.</hi> There are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſad Inſtances of this: Some I have known, that for many
Years together, have laboured under ſuch apprehenſions of Hell
and Damnation, that they have at laſt proceeded to Curſe, and
Blaſpheme God in a moſt dreadful manner; ſo that they have
been a Terrour to all their Friends and Acquaintance. And
though ſometimes they would fall into fits of <hi>obſtinate ſilence,</hi> yet
being urged to ſpeak, they would amaze all that were about them,
with the confident averment of their Damnation; with horrible
out-crys of their ſuppoſed Miſery and Torments, and with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
rage againſt Heaven. Some in this Diſtemper, will fancy
themſelves to be in <hi>Hell already,</hi> and will diſcourſe as if they ſaw
the Devils about them, and felt their Torture. Such as theſe
give plain diſcovery by their <hi>whole Carriage</hi> under their Trouble,
and ſome <hi>concomitant falſe Imaginations</hi> about other things, (as
when they fancy themſelves to be in Priſon, or Sentenced to
Death, and that Torments, or Fire, are provided for them by the
Magiſtrate, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> that 'tis only Melancholy (perverting their
underſtanding) that is the cauſe of all their Sorrow. Others
there are, who are not <hi>altogether</hi> Irrational, becauſe in moſt <hi>other</hi>
things their underſtanding is <hi>right;</hi> yet being driven into Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the occaſion of Croſſes, or other outward Afflictions, they
at laſt ſix all their thoughts upon their Souls, and now their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
becoming Irregular in part, the whole of the Irregularity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
only in that, wherein they chiefly concern themſelves. Hence
they misjudg themſelves, and condemn themſelves to everlaſting
Deſtruction; ſometimes without any <hi>apparent</hi> cauſe, and ſometimes
they accuſe themſelves of ſuch things as they <hi>never did;</hi> they fear
and cry out they are Damned, but they cannot give a particular <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
why they ſhould entertain theſe fears, neither can they ſhew
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:49412:202"/>
any cauſe why they ſhould refuſe the Comforts of the Promiſes that
are offered, but they ſay, they know, or are perſwaded it is ſo; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no better account than this, <hi>It is ſo, becauſe it is ſo.</hi> Or if they
give reaſons of their Imagination, they are commonly either <hi>feigned,</hi>
or <hi>frivolous,</hi> and yet in all other matters they are <hi>Rational,</hi> and ſpeak
or act like Men in their right Minds. Of both theſe kinds of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation
I ſhall ſpeak nothing further; 'tis enough to have noted
that ſuch there are, becauſe the Cure of the former is <hi>impoſſible,</hi>
and the Cure of the latter doth wholly depend upon <hi>Phyſick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some may poſſibly <hi>queſtion,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Whether all <hi>extraordinary</hi> Agonies
of Soul, upon the apprehenſion of <hi>eternal Damnation,</hi> be not the
fruits of <hi>Melancholy?</hi> and if not, then what may the <hi>difference</hi> be
betwixt thoſe that proceed from Melancholy, and thoſe that are
properly the Terrours of Conſcience?</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt part of the Queſtion,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I <hi>anſwer,</hi> 1. That <hi>all</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Diſtreſſes, <hi>are not</hi> to be aſcribed to Melancholy. For, 1.
There are ſome Melancholy Perſons who are never <hi>more free</hi> from
Spiritual Troubles (though frequently accuſtomed to them at
other times) than when (upon the occaſion of ſome ſpecial
Trouble, or Sickneſs, threatning Death) there is <hi>greateſt cauſe</hi>
to fear ſuch onſets upon the <hi>increaſe</hi> of Melancholy; ſome ſuch I
have known. 2. Sometimes theſe Diſtreſſes come <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> their
Conſcience ſmiting them in the very <hi>act</hi> of Sin; and theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſometime ſuch, as are not of a <hi>Melancholick Conſtitution.
Spira</hi> was ſuddenly thunder-ſtruck with Terrours of Conſcience,
upon his Recantation of ſome Truths which he held; and ſo were
ſome of the <hi>Martyrs.</hi> Sometimes Terrours that have continued
<hi>long,</hi> and have been very <hi>fierce,</hi> are removed in a <hi>moment.</hi> Now,
'tis not rational to ſay, that Melancholy only occaſioned all
ſuch Troubles, where in Bodies that are not <hi>naturally</hi> of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
(and ſome ſuch have been ſurpriſed with terrours of
Conſcience): if we will take a liberty to ſuppoſe an <hi>accidental Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,</hi>
we muſt of neceſſity allow <hi>ſome</hi> time; and (uſually)
ſome <hi>precedaneous occaſion,</hi> to mould them into ſuch a Diſtemper.
Neither do the <hi>fears</hi> of Melancholy ceaſe on a <hi>ſudden,</hi> but abate
<hi>gradually,</hi> according to the gradual abatement of the Humour.
To ſay that <hi>Cain</hi>'s, or <hi>Judas</hi>'s diſpair were the invaſions of
ſtrong Melancholy, is not only beyond all <hi>Proof,</hi> but alſo <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi>
Neither is it likely that <hi>David</hi> (whoſe <hi>ruddy</hi> Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and Inclination to <hi>Muſick,</hi> are tokens of a Sanguine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion)
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:49412:202"/>
was <hi>always</hi> Melancholick under his frequent complaints
of Spiritual Trouble.</p>
                     <p>4. They that read the ſtory of <hi>Spira,</hi> and obſerve his <hi>rational ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>
Replies, to the Diſcourſes that were offered him for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and his Carriage all along, will have no cauſe to conclude
his Trouble to be <hi>only</hi> Melancholy; neither did the ſober judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
By-ſtanders aſcribe his Diſtreſs to any ſuch cauſe.</p>
                     <p>5. The Agony of <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the Croſs, under the ſenſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wrath for our Sins, (though it were <hi>without Deſperation)</hi>
is an undeniable Proof, that there may be <hi>deep ſenſe</hi> of God's <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure</hi>
upon the Soul of Man; which cannot be aſcribed to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</p>
                     <p>2. I anſwer, That it is not to be denied, but that God <hi>may</hi>
make uſe of that Humour as his <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> for the increaſe and
continuance of Terrours upon the Conſciences of thoſe, whom
he thinks fit to Puniſh (for any provocation) with Spiritual
Deſertion. As he made uſe of that Diſtemper to puniſh <hi>Saul</hi> and
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vid. Fel. Plateri obſerv. lib. 1. in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</note> I ſpeak not here of thoſe Diſtreſſes which are
<hi>nothing elſe</hi> but Melancholy, (ſuch as thoſe before mentioned, of
which Phyſicians have given us frequent Hiſtories) though in this
caſe, the ſecret ways of God's Providences are to be adored with
humble ſilence; but of thoſe Terrours of Conſcience which have
a <hi>mixture</hi> of Melancholy to help them forward, yet ſo, as that
the Judgment and Reaſon are not thereby <hi>perverted. Spira,</hi> when
his Caſe was haſtily concluded, by an injudicious Friend, to be a
ſtrong Melancholy, made this reply: <hi>Well, be it ſo, ſeeing you will
needs have it ſo; for thus alſo is God's Wrath manifeſted againſt me.</hi>—
Which ſhews, 1. That he believed, God doth <hi>ſometimes</hi> manifeſt
his Wrath againſt Man by Melancholy. And, 2. That he denied
this to be <hi>his condition:</hi> For he ſtill concluded, that God ſent the
Terrours of his Wrath <hi>immediately</hi> upon his Conſcience, as the
Sentence of his juſt Condemnation, for denying Chriſt. Now
when God doth make uſe of Melancholy, as his Inſtrument in
Satan's hand, to make the Soul of Man more apprehenſive of his
ſin and God's Wrath, (though he doth not always make uſe of
this means, as hath been ſaid) while he ſtill preſerves the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
from falſe <hi>Imaginations.</hi> The Diſtreſs is ſtill <hi>Rational,</hi>
and we have no cauſe to make any great difference betwixt theſe
Troubles that have ſuch a mixture of Melancholy, and ſuch as
have not. Neither muſt we ſay, That then 'tis in the power of
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:49412:203"/>
the <hi>Phyſician</hi> to remove, or mitigate ſuch Spiritual Diſtreſſes. For
if God ſee it fit to make uſe of Melancholy for ſuch a purpoſe,
he can <hi>ſuſpend</hi> the power of Phyſick, ſo that it ſhall not do its
work till God hath performed all his Purpoſe. And the <hi>unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfulneſs</hi>
of Remedies in this Diſtemper, (while it ſeems to be
wonderfully ſtubborn, in reſiſting all that can be done for Cure)
is more to be aſcribed (in ſome caſes) to <hi>God's Deſign,</hi> than
every Phyſician doth imagine.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>latter</hi> part of the Queſtion. How the Terrours of
Melancholy, and thoſe of Conſcience are to be <hi>diſtinguiſhed,</hi> I
ſhall only ſay this: That (as I ſaid) we are not much concerned
to make <hi>any diſtinction,</hi> where the Diſtreſſed Party acts <hi>rationally.</hi>
'Tis true, <hi>ſomething</hi> may be obſerved from theſe <hi>mixtures</hi> of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy;
and thence may ſome <hi>Indications</hi> be taken by the
Friends of the Diſtreſſed, which may be of uſe to the Afflicted
Party. <hi>Phyſick</hi> in this caſe is not to be neglected, becauſe (though
God may permit that Diſtemper in order to the Terrour of the
Conſcience) we are not of God's Counſel, to know <hi>how high</hi> he
would have it to go, nor <hi>how long</hi> to continue; but 'tis our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(with ſubmiſſion to him) to uſe all means for help. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſeeing the <hi>Phyſician</hi> is the only <hi>proper Judg</hi> of the Bodily
Diſtemper, it were improper to ſpeak of the Signs of Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in theſe <hi>mixt caſes,</hi> to thoſe that cannot make uſe of them.
And as for theſe Diſtreſſes of Melancholy that are <hi>Irrational,</hi> they
are of themſelves ſo notorious, that I need not give any account of
them. There is uſually a <hi>Conſtitution</hi> inclining that way, and
often the <hi>Parents,</hi> or Friends of the Party, have been handled in
the ſame manner before; or if their Natural Temper do not lead
them that way, there is uſually ſome Croſs, Trouble, Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or the like outward Affliction that hath firſt preſſed them
heavily, and by degrees hath wrought them into Melancholy,
and then afterward they come to concern themſelves for their
Souls.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. demen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</note> (As that Woman in <hi>Platers</hi> Obſervations, who being
long grieved with Jealouſie upon Grounds too juſt, at laſt fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
grievous diſpair, crying out; <hi>That God would not Pardon her;
that ſhe was Damned; that ſhe felt Hell already, and the Torments
of it,</hi> &amp;c.) Or there are ſome <hi>Concomitant Delirium</hi>'s, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
apparently abſurd, or falſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which give plain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
of Irrational Diſtreſſes. And if there remained any
doubt concerning them, the conſideration of <hi>all Circumſtances</hi>
                        <pb n="383" facs="tcp:49412:203"/>
together, by ſuch as are Sober and Judicious, would eaſily afford
a ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>3. Having now confined the Diſcourſe to the <hi>Spiritual Diſtreſſes</hi>
of God's Children, that are not ſo oppreſſed with Melancholy,
as to be miſled with falſe Imaginations; I muſt next, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe Diſtreſſes, offer another obſervable <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> which is
this: That they are either made up of <hi>all the five</hi> forementioned
Ingredients, or only of <hi>ſome of them,</hi> and ſo may be called <hi>Total,</hi>
or <hi>Partial;</hi> though in each of theſe there may be great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of Degrees. 1. Sometimes then the Children of God
may be brought into <hi>Total</hi> Diſtreſſes of Conſcience, even with
<hi>Deſperation,</hi> and (that which is more hideous) with <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi>
If Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his Obſervation hold true,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Treat.</hi> of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions.</note> who tells us, <hi>That
they may be ſo over-charged with Sorrow, as to cry out they are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and to blaſpheme God.</hi> And we have no reaſon to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
it, when we obſerve how far <hi>David</hi> went in his haſte, more
than once. And whatever may be the <hi>private</hi> differences betwixt
theſe and the Reprobates, in their Agonies (as differences there
are, both in <hi>God's Deſign,</hi> and <hi>their Hearts,</hi> though not viſible)
yet if we compare the Fears, Troubles, and Speeches of the one
and the other together, there appears <hi>little</hi> or no difference which
By-ſtanders can certainly fix upon. If it ſeems harſh to any, that
ſo horrid a thing as <hi>Deſpair</hi> ſhould be charged upon the <hi>Elect of
God,</hi> in the <hi>worſt</hi> of their Diſtreſſes, it will readily be anſwered;
1. That if we <hi>ſuppoſe not</hi> this, we muſt ſuppoſe that which <hi>is
worſe.</hi> If we like not to ſay, that God's <hi>Children</hi> may fall <hi>into
Deſpair;</hi> we muſt conclude (very uncharitably) that they <hi>that
fall</hi> into Deſpair, are not God's Children. 2. 'Tis eaſie to imagine
a difference betwixt <hi>Partial</hi> and <hi>Total</hi> Diſpair, betwixt <hi>Imaginary</hi>
and <hi>Real.</hi> The Children of God, under ſtrong perturbation of
Spirit, may imagine themſelves to do what they do not, and ſo
may bear <hi>falſe Witneſs</hi> againſt themſelves; profeſſing that all their
hope of Salvation is loſt, when yet the <hi>Root</hi> of their hope may ſtill
remain in their Hearts <hi>undiſcovered.</hi> The <hi>habit</hi> may be there, when
all viſible <hi>Acts</hi> of it are at <hi>preſent</hi> ſuſpended, or ſo diſguiſed in a
croud of confuſed Expreſſions, that they cannot be known. Or,
if they have <hi>real diſtruſt</hi> of their Salvation, yet every <hi>fit</hi> of real
Diffidence,<note place="margin">Ames <hi>caſes of conſc.</hi> lib. 4. cap. 9.</note> is not <hi>utter Deſperateneſs;</hi> neither will it denominate
a Man to be <hi>totally deſperate,</hi> any more than every <hi>Error,</hi> even
about <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> will denominate a Man an <hi>Heretick.</hi> For as
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:49412:204"/>
it muſt be a <hi>pertinacious</hi> Error in <hi>Fundamentals</hi> that makes an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,
ſo it muſt be a <hi>pertinacious Diffidence</hi> that makes a Man
truly deſperate. 3. But ſometimes the Children of God have only
<hi>Partial</hi> Diſtreſſes. That is, they may have a great meaſure of
<hi>ſome</hi> of the Ingredients, without mixture of the reſt. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
they may have a great meaſure of the <hi>ſenſe of Divine Wrath</hi>
and Deſertion, <hi>without Deſperation.</hi> The poſſibility of this is
evident, beyond exception, in the Example of our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
when he cry'd out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken
me?</hi> None can aſcribe Deſperation to him, without Blaſphemy;
and if they ſhould, the very words, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> (expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his full and certain <hi>hope)</hi> do expreſly contradict them. Such
an inſtance, of Spiritual Diſtreſs <hi>without Deſperation,</hi> I take <hi>Heman</hi>
to be. How high his Troubles were, is abundantly teſtified in
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. and yet that his hope was <hi>not loſt,</hi> appears not only by
his <hi>Prayer</hi> for relief in the general; (for Hope is not utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
where the appointed means for help are carefully uſed,)
but by the particular <hi>avouchment</hi> of his Hope in God, in the firſt
verſes of that Pſalm, <hi>O Lord God of my Salvation, I have cried day
and night before thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. The laſt difference of Spiritual Diſtreſſes which I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
is this; That ſome are more <hi>Tranſient fits</hi> and <hi>flaſhes</hi> of
Terror, under a <hi>preſent Temptation,</hi> which endure not long; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are more <hi>fixed</hi> and permanent. The <hi>leſs</hi> durable Diſtreſſes
may be <hi>violent</hi> and ſharp, while they hold. Temptations of
Diffidence may ſtrongly poſſeſs a Child of God, and at firſt may
<hi>not be repelled;</hi> and then before their Faith can recover it ſelf, they
vent their preſent ſad apprehenſions of their Eſtate, as <hi>Jonah</hi> did,
Jon. 2. 4. <hi>I ſaid I am caſt out of thy ſight.</hi> Many ſuch fits <hi>David</hi>
had, and in them, complained at this rate, <hi>Why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
me? Why caſteſt thou off my Soul?</hi> Pſal. 31. 32. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte,
I am cut off from before thine Eyes.</hi> Pſal. 116. 11. <hi>I ſaid in my
haſte, all Men are Lyars.</hi> Which was a great height of Diſtruſt,
and too boldly reflecting upon God's Faithfulneſs, conſidering the
<hi>ſpecial</hi> Promiſes that God had made to him. Such ſharp fits were
thoſe of <hi>Bainham,</hi> and <hi>Bilney,</hi> Martyrs, whoſe Conſciences were
ſo ſorely wounded for Recanting the Truth which they profeſſed,
that they ſeemed to feel a very <hi>Hell</hi> within them.</p>
                     <p>The more <hi>fixed</hi> Diſtreſſes, as they are of <hi>longer</hi> continuance,
ſo they are often accompanied with the very <hi>worſt Symptomes:</hi> For
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:49412:204"/>
when in theſe Agonies, <hi>no Sun nor Star of comfort appears to them
for many days, all hope that they ſhall be ſaved ſeems to be taken away;</hi>
and being <hi>tired out</hi> with Complaints and Importunities, without
any Anſwer, they at laſt reject the uſe of Means. Some have
lain many Years (as the <hi>Paralytick</hi> Man at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda)</hi>
without Cure. Some from their Youth up, as <hi>Heman</hi> complains.
Some carry their Diſtreſſes to their <hi>Death-Bed,</hi> and it may be,
are not eaſed till their Souls are ready to depart out of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and then they often end <hi>ſuddenly</hi> and <hi>comfortably.</hi> Some,
I could tell you of, who on their Death-Bed after grievous Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and many Out-crys, concerning their miſeries of <hi>Blackneſs
and Darkneſs for ever,</hi> lay long ſilent; and then on a ſudden brake
out into Raptures of Joy, and adoring Admiration, of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God, uſing that ſpeech of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 11. 33. O
the depth of the riches, both of the Wiſdom and knowledg of God!
how unſearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi>
Others go out of the World in <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> without any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Comfort: Such an Inſtance was Mr. <hi>Chambers,</hi> (as the
ſtory of his Death teſtifies) mentioned by Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> in his
Treatiſe of Deſertions, of whom this account is given; that in
great Agonies he cried out, <hi>he was Damned,</hi> and ſo died. The
caſe of ſuch is ſurely very ſad to themſelves, and appears no leſs
to others; yet we muſt take heed of judging raſhly concerning
ſuch. Nay, if their former Courſe of Life hath been <hi>uniformly
good,</hi> (for who will reject a fine Web of Cloth (as one ſpeaks)
for a little courſe Liſt at the end,) eſpecially if there be any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
appearance of hope. (As that Expreſſion of Mr. <hi>Chambers,
[O that I had but one drop of Faith!]</hi> is by Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſuppoſed
to be); we ought to judg the beſt of them. We have ſeen the
nature of Spiritual Diſtreſſes, in the Ingredients and Differences
thereof. We are now to Conſider,</p>
                     <p>2. Satan's method in procuring them: Which conſiſts, 1. In
the <hi>Occaſions</hi> which he lays hold on for that end. 2. In the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi>
which he uſeth. 3. In the working up of their <hi>Fears,</hi>
by which he confirms Men in them.</p>
                     <p>1. As to the Occaſions: He follows much the <hi>ſame Courſe</hi>
which hath been deſcribed before in Spiritual Troubles; ſo that
I need not ſay much, only I ſhall note <hi>two</hi> things. 1. That it
makes much for Satan's purpoſe, if the Party againſt whom he
deſigns, have faln into ſome <hi>grievous ſins.</hi> Sins of <hi>common</hi> Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:49412:205"/>
do not lay a foundation ſuitable to the Superſtructure
which he intends; he cannot plauſibly argue <hi>Reprobation,</hi> or <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
from every <hi>ordinary</hi> ſin; but if he finds them guilty of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
extraordinary, then he falls to work with his Accuſations.
The moſt uſual ſins which he takes advantage from, are (as
Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> obſerves) thoſe againſt the <hi>Third, Sixth,</hi> and <hi>Seventh</hi>
Command; ſometimes thoſe againſt the <hi>Ninth.</hi> Murther, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Perjury, and the wilful denial of Truth againſt Conſcience,
are the Crimes upon which he grounds his Charge, but moſt
uſually the laſt. Upon this the diſtreſſed <hi>Spira,</hi> and ſome of the
<hi>Martyrs.</hi> As for the other, the more <hi>private</hi> they are, Satan hath
oft the <hi>more</hi> advantage againſt them, becauſe God's ſecret and
juſt Judgment, will by this means <hi>bring to Light the hidden things
of Darkneſs;</hi> and force their Conſciences to accuſe them, of that
which no Man could lay to their Charge, that he might manifeſt
himſelf to be <hi>the ſearcher of the Hearts, and trier of the Reins.</hi> Thus
have many been forced to diſcloſe private Murthers, ſecret Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
and to Vomit up (though with much pain and torture)
that which they have by Perjury, or Guile, extorted from others.
2. Where Satan hath not theſe particular Advantages, he doth
endeavour to prepare Men for Diſtreſſes, by <hi>other</hi> Troubles <hi>long
continued.</hi> All men that are brought to diſpair of their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
muſt not be ſuppoſed to be <hi>greater Sinners</hi> than others; ſome
are diſtreſſed with fears of Eternal Damnation, that are in a good
meaſure able to make <hi>Job</hi>'s proteſtation in theſe caſes: That
their <hi>Heart hath not been deceived by a Woman:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 31. 9 &amp;c.</note> That they <hi>have not
laid wait at their Neighbours door:</hi> That they <hi>have not lift up their
hand againſt the Fatherleſs, when they ſaw their help in the Gate; that
their Land doth not cry againſt them, nor the Furrows thereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain;
that when they ſaw the Sun when it ſhined, or the Moon walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in brightneſs, their Heart hath not been ſecretly enticed, nor their
Mouth kiſſed their Hand; that they rejoyced not in the deſtruction of
him that hated them, nor lift up themſelves when evil found him,</hi> &amp;c.
Notwithſtanding all which their Fears are upon, and prevail
againſt them. But then before Satan can bring them to conſent
to ſuch diſmal Concluſions againſt themſelves, they muſt be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
fitted</hi> to take the Impreſſion; either <hi>tired</hi> out under
<hi>great</hi> Afflictions, or <hi>long</hi> exerciſed with <hi>Fears</hi> about their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Eſtates, without intermixture of Comfort, or Eaſe, or their
Faculties <hi>broken</hi> and weakned by Melancholy. Any of theſe give
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:49412:205"/>
him an advantage <hi>equivalent</hi> to that of <hi>great Sins.</hi> For though
he cannot ſay to theſe, your ſins are ſo Enormous, that they are
(conſidered themſelves together with their Circumſtances) <hi>ſad
ſigns</hi> or Reprobation; yet he will plead that <hi>God's carriage</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, doth plainly diſcover that he hath wholly caſt them
off, and left them to themſelves, without hope of Mercy.</p>
                     <p>2. As for the <hi>Arguments</hi> which he uſeth, they are much-what
from the ſame <hi>Topicks</hi> which he maketh choice of in bringing on
Spiritual Troubles. Only as he aims at the Proof of a great deal
more againſt God's Children, than that they are not Converted;
ſo accordingly he ſcrues up his <hi>Mediums</hi> for proof to an higher
pin. His Arguments are,</p>
                     <p>1. From <hi>Scriptures wreſted,</hi> or miſapplied. His choice of
Scriptures for this purpoſe, is of ſuch places as either ſeem to
ſpeak moſt ſadly the dangerous and fearful Eſtate of Men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>firſt view</hi> and literal repreſentation of them,
through the unskilfulneſs of thoſe that are to be concerned; Or
of ſuch places as do <hi>really</hi> ſignifie the miſerable Unhappineſs of
ſome Perſons, who through their own fault, have been cut off
from all hope, and the poſſibility of the like to ſome others for
the future. So that in framing Arguments from Scripture, the
Devil uſeth <hi>a twofold</hi> cunning. 1. There are ſome Scriptures
which have the word <hi>Damnation</hi> in them, applied to ſome <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Acts</hi> and Miſcarriages of Men; when yet their <hi>intendment</hi> is
not ſuch as the word ſeems to ſound, or as he would make them
to believe. Now, when he catcheth a Child of God in ſuch
acts as are there ſpecified, (if he finds that his Ignorance, or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merouſneſs
is ſuch, as may render the Temptation feazible) he
preſently applies Damnation to them by the authority of thoſe
Texts. For inſtance, that Text of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. hath been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
abuſed to that end; <hi>He that doubteth, is Damned if he
eat.</hi>—The word <hi>Damned</hi> there, ſtrikes deep with a weak trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Chriſtian, that is not skilful in the Word of Righteouſneſs.
For whether Satan apply it to <hi>Sacramental eating</hi> (as ſometimes
he doth to the Ignorant, though contrary to the purpoſe of the
Text,) or to <hi>Doubting</hi> in the general, he makes this concluſion
out of it: <hi>Thou doubteſt, or thou haſt eaten the Sacrament doubtingly,
therefore there is no hope for thee; thou art Damned.</hi> Whereas all
this while, the Devil doth but play the Sophiſter in the abuſe of
the <hi>ſignification</hi> of words. For that Scripture evidently relates
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:49412:206"/>
to the <hi>difference</hi> that then was in the Church, about eating thoſe
Meats that were unclean by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law: In which caſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
doth poſitively declare, that the difference betwixt clean
and unclean Meats, is taken away; ſo that a Chriſtian might
with all freedom imaginable, eat thoſe Meats that were formerly
unclean, with this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that he were <hi>fully perſwaded in his own
mind.</hi> The neceſſity of which ſatisfaction, he proves from this,
That otherwiſe he ſhould offend his own Conſcience, which in
that caſe muſt needs <hi>Condemn</hi> him (and that's the Damnation
that is there ſpoken of); as is more evident by comparing this
Verſe with the next foregoing; <hi>Happy is he that Condemneth not
himſelf.</hi> But he that doubteth, doth <hi>Condemn</hi> himſelf, becauſe
<hi>he eats not of Faith;</hi> that is, from <hi>full perſwaſion</hi> of the lawfulneſs
of the thing. This Scripture then hath nothing at all in it, to
the purpoſe for which Satan brings it; It doth not ſpeak of any
<hi>finall ſentence</hi> of Condemnation paſſed upon a Man for ſuch an
Act; all, and the utmoſt that it ſaith, is only this, That it is <hi>a
ſin</hi> to go againſt the perſwaſion of Conſcience, and conſequently
it puts no Man further off Salvation, than any <hi>other</hi> ſin may do;
for which, upon repentance, the Sinner may be pardoned.</p>
                     <p>Another Text which Satan hath frequently abuſed, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great prejudice of many, is that of 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 29. He that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh Damnation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
With this Scripture he inſults over the humble fearful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
who is ſenſible of his unworthineſs of ſo great a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.
Sometimes he keeps him off long from the Sacrament of
the Lord's Supper, upon this very ſcore; That ſuch an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Wretch ought not to make ſuch near and familiar approaches
to Chriſt. And if at laſt he is perſwaded to partake of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
then (taking the advantage of the Parties Conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his great Vileneſs, and the very low thoughts which he
entertains of himſelf) he endeavours to perſwade him, that now
he hath <hi>deſtroyed himſelf for ever,</hi> and run upon his own irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable
Damnation. Thus he pleads it; <hi>Can any thing be more
plain, than that thou haſt eaten and drunken unworthily? Thy own
Conſcience tells thee ſo: and can any thing be more poſitively aſſerted
than this, that he that doth ſo, eateth and drinketh Damnation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
What then canſt thou think of thy ſelf, but that thou art a
damned Wretch?</hi> Neither do I ſpeak barely, what may be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Satan <hi>would ſay</hi> in this matter, but what may be proved by
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:49412:206"/>
many Inſtances he <hi>hath ſaid</hi> and urged upon the Conſciences of
the Weak, who have from hence concluded (to the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of their Souls) that by unworthy receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they have ſealed up their own Condemnation; and all
this by abuſing and <hi>perverting</hi> the ſenſe of this Text. For the
unworthy receiving, doth relate to the Miſcarriages which he <hi>had
taxed</hi> before, and it implies a <hi>careleſs, prophane eating;</hi> ſuch as
might plainly expreſs the ſmall, or unworthy eſteem that they
had in their Hearts for that Ordinance. And the <hi>Damnation</hi> there
threatned, is not <hi>finall</hi> and irrecoverable Damnation, but <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Judgment;</hi> as the Apoſtle himſelf doth explain it, in the next
Verſes: <hi>For this cauſe many are ſickly.—And if we would judg
our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged.</hi>—That is (as he further
explains it) we ſhould not be thus Chaſtned, or Afflicted; and
the word tranſlated <hi>Damnation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> doth ſignifie Judgment. At the
furtheſt, if we ſhould take it for the Condemnation of Hell, all
that is threatned would be no more than this; That ſuch have
<hi>deſerved,</hi> and God in Juſtice might inflict the Condemnation of
Hell for ſuch an offence: Which is not only true of <hi>this ſin,</hi> but
of <hi>all others,</hi> which ſtill do admit of the <hi>exception</hi> of Repentance.
All this while this is nothing to the poor humbled Sinner, that
judgeth himſelf unworthy in his moſt ſerious Examination, and
greateſt Diligence. Satan here plays upon the unexactneſs of the
Tranſlation, and the ignorance of the Party in <hi>Criticiſms;</hi> for
'tis not every one that can readily anſwer ſuch <hi>Captious</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
2. But he hath another piece of Cunning, which is this:
He doth by a ſigular kind of Art, <hi>threap</hi> upon Men ſome Scripture
that really ſpeaks of Eternal Condemnation, without any ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
evidence in <hi>matter of Fact</hi> for the due application of them,
only becauſe they <hi>cannot prove</hi> the contrary. His proceeding
herein is to this purpoſe: Firſt, (After he hath prepared his way,
by forming their minds to a fearful ſuſpition of their Eſtate)
he ſets before them ſuch Scriptures as theſe; God <hi>hardned the
heart of Pharaoh:</hi> He hath prepared <hi>Veſſels of Wrath, fitted for
Deſtruction.</hi> Chriſt prayed not <hi>for the World:</hi> And that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Jews, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their hearts,</hi>
Secondly, He confidently <hi>affirms,</hi> that they are ſuch. Thirdly,
He puts <hi>them</hi> to prove the contrary, and herein he ſends them to
the ſearch of God's <hi>Eternal Decrees;</hi> in which Art, Satan (like an
<hi>Ignis fatuus)</hi> leads them out of the way. And though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:49412:207"/>
poſſibly <hi>determine</hi> what he affirms, he ſhifts off the <hi>poſitive
proof</hi> from himſelf, and leaves it upon them to make out, that
they <hi>are not thus determined of</hi> by God's unchangeable purpoſe.
And becauſe the tempted (under ſo great a Cloud) have no ſuch
<hi>perſwaſion</hi> of their preſent Graces, as may enable them to make
<hi>ſure their Election,</hi> by the Fruits of their <hi>Vocation,</hi> they are beaten
off from their hold and are brought to believe that the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is unanſwerable: Becauſe they cannot ſay <hi>they are Converted,</hi>
they conclude they <hi>muſt be Damned;</hi> overlooking the true An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that they might make, by keeping cloſe to the <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> or
<hi>Probability</hi> that they <hi>may be</hi> Converted, and ſo eſcape the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Hell. This <hi>general hope</hi> being of ſuch high concern to
the diſtreſſed, (for 'tis the firſt thing that muſt relieve them, till
better Evidence come in) it is Satan's great policy to Cheat
them of it, which he often doth by this Method now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
                     <p>2. Satan doth mainly endeavour to <hi>miſrepreſent</hi> God to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Souls, and from thence he draweth out Arguments againſt
them. In the former caſe of <hi>Spiritual Troubles,</hi> he miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
God, in that he repreſents only ſome Attributes of his, not
only <hi>diſtinct</hi> from, but in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to others, by which he labours
to conceal the ſweet and beautiful <hi>Harmony</hi> that is among them;
and alſo to make one Attribute, an Argument againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
ſupporting Conſiderations, which another would afford.
He inſiſts upon God's Juſtice without reſpect of Mercy, upon
his Holineſs, without any regard of his Gracious Condeſcentions
to the Infirmities of the Weak. But when it is his buſineſs to
bring any under Spiritual <hi>Diſtreſſes,</hi> he then miſrepreſents God at
an <hi>higher rate,</hi> and ſticks not to aſperſe him with abominable
<hi>Falſhoods.</hi> There are two Lies which he commonly urgeth at
this time.</p>
                     <p>1. He repreſents God as a <hi>Cruel Tyrant,</hi> of a rigorous unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Diſpoſition, that delights himſelf in the Ruine and Miſery
of Men. To this purpoſe he rakes together the <hi>harſheſt</hi> paſſages
of the Scripture, that ſpeak of God's juſt <hi>Severity</hi> againſt the
<hi>wilful</hi> obſtinate Sinners, that ſtubbornly contemn his offers of
Grace. God indeed hath cleared himſelf of this Aſperſion, by
Solemn <hi>Oath, Ezek. 33. 11. As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have
no pleaſure in the death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from
his way and live.</hi> Yet the Tempted will ſooner believe Satan's
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:49412:207"/>
                        <hi>Suggeſtion</hi> than God's <hi>Oath;</hi> partly becauſe the ſenſe of their <hi>Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
doth ſecretly ſway them to think, there is <hi>Reaſon</hi> that he
ſhould be ſo; partly becauſe their <hi>Fears</hi> incline them to ſuſpect the
<hi>worſt;</hi> and partly the uneaſie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oſſings of their Mind long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
reviveth the natural <hi>frowardneſs</hi> of the ſpirit againſt God.
Which, how apt it is (when fretted with Vexation) to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
harſh thoughts of God? May be ſeen in the anſwer of the
ſlothful Servant to his Lord, who returned his Talent back again
unimproved, with a <hi>Reflection:</hi> Importing that his Maſter was
ſuch as none could pleaſe; ſo Severe, that he was diſcouraged
from making any attempt of ſerving him acceptably, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 24.
He ſaid, <hi>Lord, I know thee that thou art an hard Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> reaping where
thou haſt not ſown, and gathering where thou haſt not ſtrawed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. He belies God further, by repreſenting him as <hi>deſigning</hi> the
Ruine and Miſery of the Tempted Perſon in particular. He
would make him believe that God had a <hi>particular ſpleen</hi> (as it
were) againſt him above other Men; and that in all his dealings
with, or concerning him, he is but as a <hi>Bear lying in wait, and as
a Lyon in ſecret places,</hi> ready to take any advantage to cut him
off. And accordingly he gives no other Interpretation of all the
Ways of God, but ſuch as make them look like Tokens of <hi>finall</hi>
Rejection of thoſe that are concerned in them. If there be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them outward <hi>Afflictions,</hi> he tells them, theſe are but the
<hi>Forerunners</hi> of Hell: If they lie under inward <hi>ſenſe of Wrath,</hi> he
calls that the <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> of everlaſting Vengeance: If any
particular <hi>Threatning</hi> be impreſſed upon their Conſciences by the
Spirit of God, in order to their Humiliation and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
he repreſents it as God's <hi>final Sentence,</hi> and abſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
againſt them. If for Caution, God ſee it fit to ſet
before them the <hi>Examples</hi> of his Wrath, (as it is very frequent
for him to do, leſt we <hi>ſhould fall after the ſame example of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi>
1 Pet. 2. 6. 1 Cor. 10. 6.) Satan perverts this to that which
God never intended, for he boldly aſſerts, that theſe Examples
<hi>prognoſticate</hi> their Miſery; and that God ſignifies by them, a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of certain unavoidable Unhappineſs.</p>
                     <p>This muſt be obſerved here, That theſe miſrepreſentations of
God, are none of Satan's <hi>primary</hi> Arguments; he uſeth them
only as <hi>freſh Reſerves</hi> to ſecond others. For where he finds any
Wing of his <hi>Batalions</hi> ready to be beaten, he comes up with theſe
Supplies to relieve them. For indeed, theſe Conſiderations of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:49412:208"/>
God's Severity in the General, or of his ſpecial Reſolve againſt
any in Particular, are not of force ſufficient to <hi>Attaque</hi> a Soul,
that is within the <hi>Trenches</hi> of preſent Peace; they are not of
themſelves proper <hi>Mediums</hi> to produce ſuch a Concluſion. Though
we ſuppoſe God ſevere, (except we ſhould imagine him to be
an <hi>hater</hi> of Mankind <hi>univerſally)</hi> we cannot thence infer the final
Ruine of this, or that <hi>individual</hi> Perſon. And beſides, (that
theſe are <hi>unjuſtifiable</hi> Falſhoods) they cannot make the final
Damnation of any one ſo much as <hi>probable,</hi> till the Heart be firſt
<hi>weakned</hi> in its hopes, by Fears, or Doubtings, raiſed up in it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other Grounds. Then indeed Men are ſtaggered, either by
the deep ſenſe of their Unworthineſs, or ſome ſad continuing
Calamity, and the ſeeming neglect of their Prayers. If Satan
then tell them of God's Severity, or that (all his Providences
conſidered) he hath ſet them up as a <hi>Mark for the Arrows of his
Indignation,</hi> they are ready to believe his Report, it being ſo ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their preſent ſence and feeling.</p>
                     <p>3. Satan alſo fetcheth Arguments from the <hi>Sins</hi> of God's
Children, but his great Art in this is by unjuſt aggravations to
make them look like thoſe Offences; which by <hi>ſpecial exception</hi> in
Scripture, are excluded from Pardon. The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 16.
tells us of a <hi>Sin that is unto Death;</hi> that is, a ſin which if a Man
commits, he cannot eſcape Eternal Death, and therefore he
would not have ſuch a Sinner prayed for.<note place="margin">Lorinus in loc. Barth. Petrus in loc.</note> (That the Popiſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of <hi>Venial</hi> and <hi>Mortal</hi> Sins is not here intended, ſome of
the Papiſts themſelves do confeſs). What he means by that ſin
he doth not tell us, it being a thing known ſufficiently from
other Scriptures. The note of <hi>unpardonableneſs,</hi> is indeed affixed
to ſins under <hi>ſeveral Denominations;</hi> the <hi>ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
Chriſt pronounceth <hi>unpardonable,</hi> Mat. 12, 31. <hi>Total Apoſtacy</hi>
from the Truth of the Goſpel, hath no leſs ſaid of it by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
when he calls it <hi>a drawing back to Perdition,</hi> Heb. 10. 39.
Whether theſe be all one, or whether there is any other <hi>Species</hi>
of ſin irremiſſible, beſides that againſt the Holy Ghoſt, 'tis not
to our purpoſe to make enquiry. What-ever they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
Satan in this matter, makes uſe of the Texts that ſpeak
of them diſtinctly; as we ſhall preſently ſee. But beſides theſe,
the Scriptures ſpeak of ſome, that were <hi>given up to vile Affections,
and to a reprobate Mind,</hi> Rom. 1. 26, 28. And of others that
were given up <hi>to hardneſs of Heart,</hi> Mat. 13. 14. Acts 28. 26.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:49412:208"/>
Now, whoſoever they are of whom theſe things may be juſtly
affirmed, they are certainly miſerable, hopeleſs Wretches. Here
then is Satans cunning, if he can make any Child of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he hath done any <hi>ſuch Act,</hi> or Acts of Sin, as may
bring him within the <hi>compaſs</hi> of theſe Scriptures, then he inſults
over them, and tells them over and over again, that they are cut
off for ever.</p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe he aggravates all their ſins. And, 1. If he
find them guilty of any <hi>great Iniquity,</hi> he fixeth upon that, and
labours all he can to make it look moſt <hi>deſperately,</hi> that ſo he may
call it the <hi>Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and in this he hath a mighty
advantage, that moſt Men are in the <hi>Dark</hi> about that ſin: All
Men being not yet agreed whether it be a <hi>diſtinct Species</hi> of Sin,
or an <hi>higher degree</hi> of wilfulneſs relating to any particular Sin.
Upon this ſcore, Satan can lay the Charge of this ſin, upon thoſe
that <hi>Apoſtatize</hi> from the Truth, and through Weakneſs have <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted</hi>
it. (Thus he dealt with <hi>Spira,</hi> with <hi>Bilney,</hi> with <hi>Bain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and ſeveral others.) There is ſo near a reſemblance in
theſe ſins of denying Truths, to what is ſaid of the Unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Sin, that theſe Men though they were <hi>Scholars,</hi> and Men
of <hi>good Abilities,</hi> yet they were not able to anſwer the Argument
that the Devil urged againſt them, but it prevailed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
them. Upon others alſo, hath Satan the advantage to fix
this Accuſation: For let the <hi>Species</hi> of the ſin be what it will, if
they have any thing of that Notion, that the Sin againſt the
Holy Ghoſt, is a <hi>preſumptuous Act</hi> of Sin, under Temptation,
they will call any <hi>notorious Crime,</hi> the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,
becauſe of the more remarkable aggravating <hi>Circumſtances</hi> that
have accompanied ſuch a Fact. 2. He aggravates the Sins of
God's Children from the Wilfulneſs of their ſinning. 'Tis a
thing often too true, that a Child of God may be carried by a
<hi>violent Impetus,</hi> or ſtrong inclination of Affection to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Iniquity, where the <hi>forwardneſs</hi> of deſires that way, by a
ſudden haſte, do <hi>ſtifle</hi> thoſe Reluctancies of Mind, which may be
expected from one endowed with the Spirit of God; whoſe
power upon them, doth ordinarily ſway them, <hi>to luſt againſt the
Fleſh.</hi> But it is more ordinary to find a Temptation to prevail,
notwithſtanding that an enlightned Mind doth make <hi>ſome Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;</hi>
which (becauſe 'tis too feeble) is eaſily born down by
the ſtrong <hi>importunities</hi> of Satan, working upon the inclinations
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:49412:209"/>
of the Fleſh. <hi>Both</hi> theſe Caſes are improved againſt them, over
whom Satan hath got any advantage of doubting of their Eſtate.
If they have reſiſted but <hi>ineffectually,</hi> or <hi>not reſiſted</hi> at all, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
them with the <hi>higheſt</hi> Wilfulneſs, and will ſo aggravate the
matter that they ſhall be put in fear, not only that there can be
<hi>no Grace</hi> (where Sin hath ſo much power as either to <hi>controul</hi> ſo
much light and endeavours, or hath ſo <hi>ſubjected</hi> the Heart to its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
that it can command <hi>without</hi> a contradiction) but that
they can have <hi>no Hope;</hi> that they that ſin with ſo high an hand,
ſhould ever enter into God's Reſt. And to this purpoſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſets before them, that Text of <hi>Heb. 10. 26. If we ſin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
after that we have received the knowledg of the Truth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
no more Sacrifice for ſins.</hi> Or that of <hi>Heb. 6. 4. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for thoſe who were once enlightned—if they fall away, to
renew them again to Repentance.</hi> Both which places ſpeak indeed,
at leaſt, ſuch a <hi>difficulty,</hi> as in common uſe of ſpeech, is called
an <hi>impoſſibility,</hi> if not an utter <hi>abſolute</hi> impoſſibility of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Pardon. But then the <hi>ſinning wilfully,</hi> or <hi>falling away,</hi>
there mentioned, is only that of <hi>Total Apoſtacy;</hi> when Men that
have embraced the Goſpel, and by it have met with ſuch impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Power, and delight upon their Hearts, which we uſually
call <hi>Common Grace,</hi> do notwithſtanding, reject that Goſpel as
<hi>falſe</hi> and fabulous, and ſo riſe up againſt it, with Scorn and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Contempt; as <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate did. If now the true
intendment of thoſe Scriptures were conſidered, by thoſe that
are diſtreſſed with them, they might preſently ſee, that they
were put into fear, where <hi>no ſuch cauſe</hi> of fear was. But all
Men have not this knowledg, nor do they ſo duely attend to the
matter of the Apoſtles Diſcourſe, as to be able to put a right In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
upon it; upon ſuch Satan impoſeth his deceitful
gloſs, and tells them: <hi>Wilful ſinners cannot be reſtored to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but you have ſinned wilfully; when ſin was before you, you
ruſhed into it without any conſideration; as the Horſe into the Battel:
or when God ſtood in your way with Commands, and advice to the
contrary; when your Conſciences warned you not to do ſo great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
yet you would do it. You were as thoſe that break the Yoke, and
burſt the Bonds.</hi> Upon this ſuppoſition, that theſe Texts ſpeak
of <hi>wilful</hi> ſinning in the General; How little can be ſaid againſt
Satan's Argument? How many have I known, that have been
tortured with theſe Texts, judging their Eſtate fearful, becauſe
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:49412:209"/>
of their wilfulneſs in ſinning? Who upon the breaking of the
<hi>ſnare</hi> of Satan's <hi>miſrepreſentation,</hi> have eſcaped <hi>as a Bird unto the
Hill.</hi> 3. When either of the <hi>two</hi> former Ways will not ſerve the
turn, (that is, when he meets with ſuch againſt whom he hath
nothing of notorious wickedneſs to object, or ſuch as have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diſcerning of Scripture, than ſo to be impoſed upon,) he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to make a Charge againſt them, from the <hi>number</hi> of their
Miſcarriages. Here he takes up all the filth he can, and lays it
upon one heap at their Door. 'Tis indeed an eaſie thing for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
to ſet the Sins of a Child of God <hi>in order</hi> before him, and to
bring to mind <hi>innumerable</hi> Evils, eſpecially to one that is already
awakened with a true diſcovery of the Corruption of Nature,
and the Vileneſs of Sin. In which caſe, the more a Man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
the more he will diſcover; and Sins thus ſet in <hi>Battel Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,</hi>
(though they be not more than ordinary hainous, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many) have a very <hi>diſmal appearance.</hi> Satan's deſign in this,
is to bring Men under the Affrightments which ſeem moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be raiſed from a perverſe Aſpect of the <hi>third</hi> Rank of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
which a little before I pointed at. For the Word of God
ſpeaking of the Final Eſtate of Men, doth not only diſcover the
hopeleſs condition of ſome as to Eternal Life from ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Acts</hi> of Sin, but alſo the ſad Eſtate of others from the <hi>manner,
degrees,</hi> and <hi>frequency</hi> of ſinning. The Heathens, becauſe they
improved not the Knowledg of God, which they had from the
Works of Creation, neither making thoſe <hi>Inferences,</hi> in matters
relating to his Worſhip, which thoſe Diſcoveries did direct them
unto; nor behaving themſelves in full compliance to thoſe Rules
of <hi>vertuous Converſation,</hi> which they might have drawn from theſe
Principles, and unto which in point of Gratitude, they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,
<hi>Rom. 1. 21. They glorified him not as God, neither were thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi>
therefore God <hi>gave them up to a Reprobate mind.</hi> And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
concerning all others, the Scripture teacheth us, that a
return to a prophane fleſhly Life, after ſome Reformation, hath
a greater hazard in it than ordinary; as appears by the Parable,
in <hi>Mat. 12. 45. Seven more wicked Spirits re-enter;</hi> where <hi>one</hi> that
was caſt out, is received again; and, <hi>the laſt ſtate of that Man, is
worſt than the firſt.</hi> So alſo, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. To this purpoſe is that
of <hi>Soloman,</hi> concerning the danger of continuance in ſin, after
many Reproofs, <hi>Prov. 29. 1. He that being often reproved, hardneth
his Neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy.</hi>

Theſe and many ſuch like Scriptures, Satan hath in readineſs,
which he plies home upon the Conſciences of thoſe that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the ſenſe of Sin; telling them, <hi>That their Hearts and
Ways being continually evil, notwithſtanding all the Courſes that God hath
taken to reclaim them; that they having ſo long neglected ſo great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
or that after having ſeemed to entertain it, became more ſinful
than before.</hi> (Which they will eaſily believe, becauſe they are now
more ſenſible of Sin, and more obſervant of their Miſcarriages than
formerly.) <hi>There can be no queſtion, but they are given up to vile
Affections; and like the Ground that bears nothing but Briers and
Thorns, they are rejected, and nigh unto Curſing, whoſe end is to be
Burned.</hi> The Wound that is made with this Weapon, is not ſo
eaſily healed, as ſome others already mentioned; becauſe
(though Satan do <hi>unduly</hi> wreſt theſe Paſſages, to ſuch failures in
the Children of God, as have <hi>little or no affinity</hi> with them, for they
only ſpeak, of falling into <hi>open prophaneneſs with contumacy,</hi> yet)
they that have deep Convictions, accompanied with great Fears, do
uſually think that there are <hi>none worſe</hi> than they are. And though
they will grant, that ſome others have <hi>more flagitious lives,</hi> yet
they think they have <hi>Hearts</hi> ſo deſperately wicked, that they
muſt needs be under as great hazards, as thoſe whoſe Lives ſeem
to be worſe.</p>
                     <p>4. There is but one Argument more, that carries any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of proof for everlaſting Condemnation, and that is from
an <hi>hard and impenitent Heart.</hi> How Satan will manage himſelf to
make a Child of God believe, that he hath ſuch an Heart; is our
laſt obſervation relating to his <hi>Sophiſtry.</hi> And it is this, He unjuſtly
aggravates the <hi>diſcompoſures</hi> of the ſpirits of thoſe that are troubled
for Sin, and from thence draws his Arguments of irrecoverable
Damnation; pleading that their Hearts are Seared, Hardned,
uncapable of Repentance, and conſequently of Heaven. That
<hi>final Impenitency</hi> will conclude Damnation, is certain, and that ſome
have been given up to ſuch a <hi>judicial</hi> hardneſs long before Death,
that they could not Repent; may not only be evidenced from the
Threatning of God to that purpoſe, <hi>Mat. 13. Make the Heart of
this People fat,</hi> &amp;c. but alſo from the ſad Inſtances of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
(of whom 'tis ſaid, that God hardned his Heart) and the <hi>Jews</hi>
who were blinded, <hi>Rom. 11. 8. God hath given them the Spirit of
ſlumber, Eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and Ears that they ſhould not
hear.</hi> But ſtill the Art lieth in this, How to make a Child of
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:49412:211"/>
God believe that it's ſo with him. For this purpoſe he muſt take
him at ſome advantage, he cannot terrifie him with this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>all times.</hi> While he is <hi>acting</hi> Repentance, with an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed</hi>
ſettled frame of Heart, 'tis not poſſible to make him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he doth not, or cannot Repent; for this were to force him
contrary to ſenſe and experience. But he muſt take him at ſome
ſeaſon, which may, with ſome probability, admit of his Plea,
and nothing is more proper for that deſign, than a <hi>troubled Heart;</hi>
ſo that he hath in this caſe, <hi>two</hi> things to do.</p>
                     <p>1. He diſquiets the Soul into as great an <hi>height</hi> of Confuſion
as he can: That, 2. When he hath <hi>melted</hi> it into heavineſs, and
torn it into pieces, he may work upon its <hi>diſtractions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are many things that fall out in the caſe of great anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Mind, that are capable of improvement for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of this deſign. As, 1. Diſtracting troubles bring the
Heart under the <hi>ſtupidity</hi> of Amazement. Their thoughts are ſo
broken and disjoynted, that they cannot unite them to a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
ſettled reſolution in any thing, they can ſcarce <hi>joyn</hi> them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to make out ſo much as might <hi>ſpell</hi> out their <hi>diſtinct</hi> deſires,
or endeavours; they ſcarce know what they are <hi>doing,</hi> or what
they <hi>would</hi> do. 2. They alſo <hi>poyſon</hi> the thoughts with harſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
againſt God. Great diſtreſſes make the thoughts
ſometimes recoil againſt the Holy Lord, with unſeemly queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his Goodneſs and Compaſſion; and this puts Men into
a bad <hi>ſullen</hi> humour of untowardneſs, from whence (through
Satan's improvement) ariſe the greateſt <hi>plunges</hi> of diſpair.
3. Moſt uſually in this caſe, the greateſt <hi>endeavours</hi> are Fruitleſs,
and Diſſatisfactory. Satan (though he be no friend to Duty)
doth <hi>unſeaſonably</hi> urge them to Repent, and Pray, but 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they cannot do either with any <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> and then their
Failures are matter of Argument againſt them. For it they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to put themſelves upon a more ſevere courſe of Repentance,
and accordingly begin to think of their ſins, to number them,
or to aggravate them, they are uſually affrighted from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
by the hainous appearance of them; they cannot,
they dare not think of them, the remoteſt glimps of them is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to an affrighted Conſcience: the <hi>raiſing</hi> of them up again
in the <hi>Memory</hi> (like the riſing of a Ghoſt from the Grave) is far
more aſtoniſhing, than the <hi>firſt proſpect</hi> of them, after Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
So true is that of <hi>Luther, If a Man could ſee Sin perfectly, it
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:49412:212"/>
would be a perfect Hell.</hi> If they ſet themſelves to beg their Pardon
by earneſt Prayer, they are ſo <hi>diſtracted</hi> and confuſed in Prayer,
that their Prayers pleaſe them not; they come off from the Duty
<hi>more</hi> wounded, than when they began. Or if in any meaſure
they overcome theſe difficulties, ſo that they do pray, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
their Iniquities, then they urge and <hi>force</hi> a ſorrow, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction
upon themſelves, but ſtill to a greater <hi>diſſatisfaction:</hi>
For, it may be (and this uſually happens in greater Diſtreſſes)
they cannot <hi>weep,</hi> nor force a tear, or if they do, ſtill they judg
their ſorrow is not <hi>deep enough,</hi> nor any way ſuitable to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their ſin. 4. To all theſe Satan ſometimes makes a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
addition of trouble, by injecting <hi>blaſphemous</hi> thoughts: Here
he ſets the Stock, with an intention to Graff upon it afterward.
When all theſe things are thus in readineſs, then comes he to ſet
fire to the <hi>Train,</hi> and thus he endeavours to blow up the <hi>Mine.
Is not thy Heart hardned to everlaſting deſtruction? How canſt thou
deny this? Art thou not grown ſtupid, and ſenſeleſs of all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
that are before thee?</hi> (Here he inſiſts upon the amazement,
and confuſion of their Spirit; and 'tis very natural for thoſe that
are drunk with the Terrours of the Almighty, to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>ſtupid,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>diſtraction</hi> of their thoughts. I have
known ſeveral that have pleaded that very Argument to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe).
Satan goes on: <hi>What greater evidence can there be of an
hardned Heart, than Impenitency? Thou canſt not mourn enough?
Thou haſt not a tear for thy ſins, though thou couldſt weep enough for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
upon every petty occaſion; nay, thou canſt not ſo much as pray
for Pardon: Is not this, not only a Heart that doth not, but that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Repent? Beſides</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou knoweſt the ſecret thoughts that
thy Heart is privy to, do they not boyl up in thy Breaſt againſt God?
Art thou not ready to tax him for dealing thus with thee? What is
this untowardneſs, but deſperate obdurateneſs?</hi> And if with all theſe
there be blaſpemous Injections, then he tells him it is a clear
caſe that he is judicially hardned; in that <hi>he acts the part of the
damned in Hell already.</hi> By all, or ſome of theſe Deceits, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
doth often prevail ſo far with Men, that they conclude their
Heart to be ſo obſtinate, ſo ſtupid, that 'tis impoſſible that it
ſhould be ever mollified, or brought into a penitential frame, and
conſequently that there is no hope of their Salvation.</p>
                     <p>3. There is but one thing more, (beſides the occaſions which
he takes, and the Arguments which he makes uſe of) relating
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:49412:212"/>
to Satan's method for the procurement of Spiritual Diſtreſſes,
and that is his endeavour to ſtrengthen theſe Arguments, by the
increaſe of <hi>fears</hi> in their Hearts.</p>
                     <p>What Satan can do in raiſing up miſgiving, tormenting Fears,
hath been ſaid, and how ſerviceable this is to his design, I ſhall
ſhew in a few Particulars, having only firſt noted this in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
That as his deſign in theſe Diſtreſſes, is raiſed to expreſs his
<hi>utmoſt</hi> height of Malice againſt Men, in puſhing them forward to
the <hi>greateſt</hi> miſchief, by excluding them <hi>totally</hi> from the <hi>loweſt</hi>
degree of the hope of Happineſs, and by perſwading them of
the inevitable <hi>certainty</hi> of their eternal Miſery: So he doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
by the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> impreſſions of Fear, to terrifie them to
the <hi>utmoſt</hi> degree of affrightful Amazement, and conſequently the
effects of that Fear are moſt powerful. For,</p>
                     <p>1. By this means, the Spirits of Men are <hi>formed</hi> and moulded
into a frame moſt ſuitable for the belief and entertainment of the
moſt diſmal impreſſions, that Satan can put upon them. For
ſtrong fears (like Fire) do <hi>aſſimulate</hi> every thing to their own
nature, making them naturally incline to receive the blackeſt,
the moſt diſadvantagious interpretations of all things againſt
themſelves; ſo that they have no capacity to put any other
ſenſe upon what lies in their way, but the very worſt; hence
are they poſſeſſed with no other thoughts, but that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs
Wretches, deſperate Miſcreants, utterly forſaken of
God. They are brought into ſuch a woful <hi>partiality</hi> againſt
their own Peace, that they cannot <hi>judg</hi> aright of any Accuſation,
Plea, or Argument that Satan brings, for a proof of their Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;
but being fill'd with ſtrong prejudices of Hell, they think
every <hi>Sophiſm</hi> a <hi>ſtrong</hi> Argument, every <hi>Suppoſition</hi> a <hi>Truth,</hi> and
every <hi>Accuſation, concluſive</hi> of no leſs than their Eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Inſomuch that their Fears do more to <hi>diſcomfit</hi> them, than
all Satan's Forces. A <hi>dreadful ſound being in their Ears,</hi> their
ſtrength fails them at the appearance of any Oppoſition. As
when fear comes upon an Army, they throw away their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and by an eaſie Victory, give their Backs ſometimes to an
inconſiderable Enemy.</p>
                     <p>2. Men thus poſſeſſed with fear, do not only receive into their
own Bowels every Weapon which Satan directs on purpoſe,
to the wounding and ſlaying of their Hopes; but by a ſtrange
kind of belief, they imagine every thing to be the <hi>Sword of an
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:49412:213"/>
Enemy.</hi> All they hear, or meet with, turns into Poyſon to
them, for they think every thing is againſt them; <hi>Promiſes,</hi> as
well as <hi>Threatnings; Mercies,</hi> as well as <hi>Judgments;</hi> and that by
all theſe (one as well as another). God (as with a <hi>Flaming
Sword,</hi> turning every way) doth hinder their acceſs to the <hi>Tree
of Life. Bilney</hi> the Martyr (as <hi>Latimer</hi> in his Sermons reports
of him) after his denial of the Truth, was under ſuch horrours
of Conſcience, that his Friends were forced to ſtay with him
Night and Day. No Comforts would ſerve: If any comfortable
place of Scripture was offered to him, it was as <hi>if a Man ſhould
cut him through with a Sword.</hi> Nothing did him good, he
thought that <hi>all Scriptures made againſt him, and ſounded to his
Condemnation.</hi> Neither is it ſo rare a thing for Fears to form the
Imagination into ſuch miſhapen apprehenſions, as that we ſhould
think ſuch Inſtances to be only ſingular and unuſual; but 'tis a
<hi>common</hi> effect of Terrour, which few or none eſcape that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Spiritual Diſtreſſes. The <hi>blackneſs</hi> of their thoughts, make
the whole Scripture ſeem <hi>black</hi> to them: The unfit <hi>medium</hi>
through which they look, doth diſcolour every Object. So that
the <hi>Book of Life</hi> (as Mrs. <hi>Kath. Bretterge,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid.</hi> Her Story in <hi>Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ks</hi> Lives.</note> in the like caſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
her ſelf, concerning the <hi>Bible)</hi> ſeems to be nothing elſe
but a <hi>Book of Death to them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. From hence it follows, that no <hi>Counſel,</hi> or Advice, can
take place with them. Exceſſive Fears do remove their Souls ſo
far from Peace, that they will not believe there is any Hope for
them, though it be <hi>told them.</hi> The moſt compaſſionate ſerious
Admonitions of Friends, the ſtrongeſt Arguments againſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
the cleareſt diſcoveries of the Hopes that are before them,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> effect but little; while they are ſpoken (it may be) they
ſeem to relieve them a little, but the Comfort <hi>abides</hi> not
with them, 'tis ſoon gone: Though they <hi>cannot anſwer</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
brought for them, yet they cannot <hi>believe</hi> them; as if
their Souls were now deprived of all power to believe any thing
for their good. Suitable to that Expreſſion of <hi>Spira,</hi> in anſwer
to his Friends that laboured to comfort him: <hi>I would believe
Comfort but cannot, I can believe nothing but what is contrary to my
Comfort.</hi> Nay, when they are told, that many others have been
under the like dreadful apprehenſions of everlaſting Miſery, who
have at laſt been Comforted, (and by manifold Experience, we
find, that it is <hi>the greateſt eaſe to diſtreſſed Souls, to hear (eſpecially
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:49412:213"/>
to ſpeak with) ſome that have been in the like caſe;</hi> for this will
oft adminiſter <hi>ſome hope,</hi> that they alſo may <hi>at laſt</hi> be comforted,
when the moſt comfortable <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the Scripture, are a
<hi>Terrour</hi> to them). Yet this doth not effect the leaſt eaſe for
them ſometimes, becauſe ſome are ſo <hi>wholly</hi> poſſeſſed with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable</hi>
Prejudice againſt themſelves; that they think <hi>none</hi> are,
or ever were <hi>like</hi> them. They compare themſelves to <hi>Judas</hi>
and <hi>Cain,</hi> and think their Iniquity to be aggravated by many
Circumſtances, far beyond the pitch of them. Thus <hi>Spira</hi>
judged of himſelf; <hi>I tell you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my caſe is mine own,
'tis ſingular, none like it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Though Fears make the Soul unactive to any thing of
Comfort, becauſe they wholly deſtroy its inclination, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
its Byas to Hope; yet on the contrary, they make it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>nimble,</hi> and active to purſue the concluſions of Miſery,
which they have helped to frame. For the <hi>ſpring</hi> of all the
faculties of the Soul are bent that way. Hence it is, that
thoſe who are poſſeſſed with theſe Agonies, will eagerly plead
againſt themſelves, and with an admirable <hi>ſubtilty,</hi> will <hi>frame</hi>
Arguments againſt their Peace, <hi>coin</hi> Diſtinctions, and make
ſtrange <hi>Evaſions</hi> to eſcape the force of any Conſolation that
may be offered to them; their underſtandings are, as it were,
<hi>whetted</hi> by their Fears to an unimaginable <hi>quickneſs.</hi> Who
would not wonder to hear the Replies that ſome will give to
the arguings of their Friends, that labour to comfort them?
What ſtrange anſwers <hi>Spira</hi> gave to thoſe that pleaded with
him? How eaſily he ſeemed to turn off the Example of <hi>Peter</hi>
denying Chriſt, and thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of <hi>God's
Love</hi> to Mankind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be ſeen at large in his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                     <p>5. Fears, by a ſtrange kind of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> do not only make
them believe that they <hi>ſhall be</hi> unhappy, but alſo will at laſt
perſwade them, that they <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>ſee</hi> their Miſery already.
How aſtoniſhingly doth <hi>Spira</hi> ſpeak to this purpoſe? <hi>I find, he
daily more and more hardens me, I feel it.</hi> Anſwerable to this
(I remember) was the caſe of one who was long impriſoned
in deep Diſtreſſes: He told me, that he verily believed that
Scripture of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 24. was fulfilled upon him, <hi>From one
Sabbath to another, ſhall all Fleſh come to worſhip before me, and
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:49412:214"/>
they ſhall go forth and look upon the Carcaſes of the Men that have
tranſgreſſed againſt me: For their Worm ſhall not die, neither ſhall
their Fire be quenched, and they ſhall be an abhorring to all Fleſh.</hi>
To his own <hi>feeling,</hi> he had the torments of Conſcience, and
the ſenſe of Divine Wrath was as a burning Fire within
him; and to his <hi>apprehenſion,</hi> every <hi>look</hi> from others, was a
gazing upon him as <hi>a monſter</hi> of Miſery, <hi>abhorred of all fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The nature of Spiritual Diſtreſſes, and Satan's method in
working them, being explained, the laſt thing promiſed, is
now to be opened. This is,</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>burthen</hi> and weight of theſe Diſtreſſes, which how
grievous, how intollerable it is, may be ſufficiently ſeen in
what hath been already ſaid, and may be further evidenced in
the Particulars following.</p>
                     <p>1. Thoſe that are wounded with theſe <hi>fiery Darts,</hi> do at
firſt uſually <hi>conceal</hi> their Wound, and ſmother their Grief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſhamed to declare it; partly, becauſe ſome <hi>great Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion</hi>
(it may be) hath kindled all this Fire in their Boſoms,
and this they are unwilling to declare to others. Partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſuſpect (though no one remarkable Sin hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
theſe Troubles) that the diſcovery of their Caſe,
will expoſe them to the <hi>Wonder</hi> and <hi>Cenſures</hi> of all that ſhall
hear of them. By this means the Fire burns with greater ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency:
Their Sore runs continually, and having none to
ſpeak a word in ſeaſon for the leaſt Relief, it becomes more
painful and dangerous. As Bodily Diſtempers concealed by a
<hi>fooliſh modeſty</hi> from the Phyſician, increaſe the trouble and
hazard of the Patient. Here have they many ſtruglings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
themſelves, many attempts to overcome their Fears, but
all in vain; they <hi>ſit alone</hi> and <hi>keep ſilence,</hi> they flee the company
and ſociety of Men; they labour after <hi>ſolitary</hi> Places, where
they may <hi>weep</hi> with freedom, (if their Tears be not yet dried
up) or at leaſt where they may pour out their <hi>Complaints</hi>
againſt themſelves, they <hi>meditate</hi> nothing but their Miſery;
they can fix their Thoughts upon nothing elſe; they <hi>chatter as
a Crane, or Swallow, they mourn as a Dove;</hi> they are as a <hi>Pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
in the Wilderneſs, as an Owl in the Deſart,</hi> but ſtill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
eaſe. They are but as thoſe that are <hi>ſnared in Dens, and
Priſon-Houſes;</hi> who the longer they lie there, have the <hi>leſs
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:49412:214"/>
Patience</hi> to bear the preſent Unhappineſs, and the <hi>leſs Hope</hi> to
be delivered from it.</p>
                     <p>2. When they are <hi>tired</hi> out with private Conflicts, and
have no reſt or intermiſſion of Trouble, then at laſt they are
forced <hi>to Speak;</hi> and having once begun to open their Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
they care not who knows it. If there be any heinous
ſin at the bottom, their Conſciences are forced to <hi>confeſs</hi> it:
Wickedneſs (that was once ſweet in his Mouth) is <hi>turned
in his Bowels,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 20. 14, 15.</note> 
                        <hi>it is the gall of Aſps within him.</hi> Thus doth God
make Men to vomit up what they had ſwallowed down. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
chaſe away all Shame, they can now freely ſpeak againſt
their Sin, with the higheſt Aggravations. And if their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
have not an heinous Crime to accuſe them of in <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi>
yet in the <hi>general</hi> they will judg and condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as the <hi>moſt ſtubborn,</hi> ſinful, or <hi>hardned</hi> Wretches, juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
branded with indelible Characters of the Wrath of God.
However the Diſtreſs becomes greater, if they <hi>truly</hi> accuſe
themſelves of any particular Sin, that Vomit is not without
a <hi>violence</hi> offered to Nature, which otherwiſe would cover
its Shame. It cannot be done without Sickneſs, ſtraining
and torture; and when it is done, they take it for granted,
that every one paſſeth the ſame judgment upon them, which
they do upon themſelves; And the <hi>frequent</hi> ſpeaking doth
<hi>confirm</hi> their Minds in their fearful expectations. For what
Men do <hi>accuſtom</hi> themſelves to aſſert, that they do more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
<hi>believe.</hi> If they only complain of themſelves in the
general, with any intentions of procurement of Pity, (as is
uſual for the Diſtreſſed to do) yet while they cry out to
others, <hi>Is this nothing to you, all you that paſs by? Is there
any ſorrow like to my ſorrow?</hi> &amp;c. Still they think their <hi>ſtroak
is heavier than their groaning,</hi> and their Cry to others, doth ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fix this apprehenſion in themſelves, that none can be more
miſerable than they. Thus are they brought to <hi>Job</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<hi>Job 16. 6. Though I ſpeak, my Grief is not aſſwaged; and
though I forbear, what am I eaſed?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. All this while they are under an <hi>expreſſible ſenſe</hi> of Divine
Wrath. <hi>Heman</hi> ſpeaks his apprehenſions of it, under the
Similitude of the moſt hideous, and diſmal, comfortleſs <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,</hi>
Pſal. 88. 6. <hi>Thou haſt laid me in the loweſt Pit, in
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:49412:215"/>
Darkneſs, in the Deeps. David,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 3. compares it
to the <hi>ſorrows of Death,</hi> and (the higheſt that humane
thoughts can reach) the <hi>pains of Hell: The ſorrows of Death
compaſs me, and the pains of Hell gat hold upon me; I found
Trouble and Sorrow.</hi> Well might they thus judg, all things
conſidered, for Sin (that then lies heavy upon them) is a great
Weight, a <hi>Burthen</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) greater than I can bear;</hi>
eſpecially when 'tis preſſed on by an heavy Hand, <hi>thy Hand
preſſeth me ſore.</hi> Sin makes the greateſt Wound, conſidering
the Conſcience, which is wounded by it, is the <hi>tendereſt</hi> part,
and of exquiſite ſenſe. (Hence the Grief of it is compared to
the pain of a running fretting Ulcer, that diſtempers the whole
Body: <hi>(My Wounds ſtink and are corrupted; my Sore ran in
the Night and ceaſed not)</hi> Or to the pain of broken and ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
Bones. Pſal. 38. 3. <hi>There is no ſoundneſs in my Fleſh,
becauſe of thine Anger; neither is there any reſt in my Bones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of my Sin.)</hi> The <hi>Inſtrument</hi> alſo that makes the Wound
is ſharp, and cuts deep, <hi>('tis ſharper than a two-edged Sword)</hi>
but when the Weapon is poyſoned (and Satan hath a way
to do that) then it burns, making painful malignant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations.
The Wrath of God expreſſed to the Conſcience,
brings the greateſt Terrour; <hi>Who knows the power of thine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</hi>
Pſal. 90. 11. It is impoſſible for the moſt <hi>trembling</hi>
Conſcience, or moſt <hi>jealous</hi> Fears, to go to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> bounds
of it, neither can we apprehend any Torture greater; the
Rack, Tortures, Fire, Gibbets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all nothing to it.
Hence is it that thoſe who were <hi>afraid</hi> of ſuffering for Truth,
when by this means they were brought under theſe Diſtreſſes,
could then be willing to ſuffer any <hi>Torment</hi> on the Body; yea,
and heartily wiſh to ſuffer much more, ſo that theſe Tortures
might be ended.<note place="margin">Act and Mon. c. 8. p. 938.</note> Thus it was with <hi>Bainham</hi> Martyr, who
in the publick Congregation bewailed his Abjuration of the
Truth, and prayed all his Hearers <hi>rather to Die by and by, than
to do as he had done.</hi> But that of <hi>Spira,</hi> ſeems almoſt beyond
belief; thus ſpeaks he to <hi>Vergerius: If I could conceive but the
leaſt ſpark of Hope of a better Eſtate hereafter, I would not refuſe to
endure the moſt heavy weight of the Wrath of that Great God, yea,
for twenty thouſand Years, ſo that I might at length attain to the
end of that Miſery.</hi>—What dreadful Agonies were theſe,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:49412:215"/>
that put him to theſe Wiſhes? But 'tis leſs wonder, if you
obſerve what Apprehenſions he had of his preſent Trouble,
he judged it <hi>worſe</hi> than <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelf. (And if you would have
a lively Expoſition of <hi>David</hi>'s expreſſion, <hi>The pains of Hell,</hi>
&amp;c. you may fetch it from this Inſtance); <hi>My preſent Eſtate</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>I now account worſe, than if my Soul (ſeparated from
my Body) were with</hi> Judas <hi>and the reſt of the Damned; and
therefore I deſire rather to be there, than thus to live in the Body.</hi>
So that if you imagine a Man <hi>cruſht</hi> under the greateſt weight,
<hi>wounded</hi> in the moſt tender parts, and thoſe Wounds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
by the ſharpeſt <hi>Corroſives,</hi> his Bones all <hi>disjoynted</hi> and
broken, <hi>pined</hi> alſo with hunger and thirſt, and in that caſe
put under the higheſt <hi>Tortures;</hi> yet you have but a very <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi>
of Divine Wrath: Add to all theſe (according to <hi>Spira</hi>'s
wiſh) <hi>twenty thouſand Years of Hell</hi> it ſelf, yet all is nothing
to that which a diſtreſſed Mind ſuppoſeth; while the word
<hi>Eternity</hi> preſents the Soul with the <hi>total Sum</hi> of utmoſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
all at once. Oh unexpreſſible burthen of a Diſtreſſed
Mind! Who can underſtand it truly, but he that feels it?
How terribly is the Mind of Man ſhaken with Terrours, as
the <hi>Wilderneſs by a mighty Wind!</hi> which not only produceth
violent Motions, but alſo hideous Noiſe, Murmur, and
Howling.</p>
                     <p>4. This burthen upon the Mind, forceth the Tongue to
vent its Sorrow in the ſaddeſt accent of moſt doleful <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crys,</hi>
their whole language is Lamentation; but when the
pangs of their Agonies come upon them, (for their Diſtreſſes
have their Fits) then they ſpeak in the bitterneſs of their
Souls. Oh! (ſaid <hi>Bainham) I would not for all the Worlds
good, feel ſuch an Hell in my Conſcience again.</hi> One (former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentioned) in theſe Diſtreſſes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mrs.</hi> K. B.</note> crys out; <hi>Wo, wo, wo!
a woful, a wretched, a forſaken Woman!</hi> It would ſurely have
made a Man's Hair to ſtand upright for dread, to have heard
<hi>Spira</hi> roaring out that terrible Sentence: <hi>How dreadful is it to
fall into the hands of the Living God?</hi> Or to have heard his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to him that told of his being at <hi>Venice, O curſed Day!</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>O curſed Day! O that I had never gone thither,
would God I had then died!</hi> &amp;c. The like Out-crys had <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
often, <hi>Pſal. 22. 1. My God, my God, why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:49412:216"/>
me? Why art thou ſo far from helping me, and from the
words of my Roaring?</hi> And <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88. 14. <hi>Lord, why
caſteſt thou off my Soul, why hideſt thou thy Face from me?</hi>
'Tis true, <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Heman</hi>'s words, have a better Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
than thoſe others laſt mentioned, but their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
of Heart ſeems (at ſometimes) to have urged their
Expreſſions with impetuous violence; as thoſe Paſſages
ſeem to ſay, <hi>Pſal. 38. 8. I have Roared by reaſon of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs
of my Heart.</hi> Pſal. 32. 3. <hi>My Bones waxed old, through
my Roaring all the Day long.</hi> Job 3. 24. <hi>My Roarings are pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out like Water.</hi> If their Lamentations were turned into
<hi>Roarings,</hi> and thoſe Roarings were like the breaking in of a
<hi>Flood,</hi> and that Flood of ſo <hi>long</hi> continuance, that it <hi>dried</hi> up
the Marrow of the Bones, we may ſafely imagine, that they
were not ſo much at leaſure to <hi>order</hi> their words, but that
their Tongues might ſpeak in that <hi>Dialect</hi> which is proper to
Aſtoniſhment, and Diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>5. Though the Mind be the principal ſeat of theſe Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
yet the <hi>Body</hi> cannot be exempted from a <hi>Copartnerſhip</hi>
in theſe Sorrows. Notwithſtanding this is ſo far from aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Trouble, that it increaſeth it by a <hi>Circulation.</hi> The
pains of the Body, contracted by the trouble of the Mind,
are communicated again to the Fountain from whence they
came, and <hi>reciprocally</hi> augment the diſquiet of the Mind.
The Body is weakned, their <hi>ſtrength poured out like Water;</hi>
they are <hi>withered like Graſs;</hi> pined as <hi>a Skin,</hi> become as a
<hi>Bottle in the ſmoak:</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> frequently complains, <hi>Pſal.
22.</hi> 14. he deſcribes himſelf as reduced to a <hi>Skeliton: I am
poured out like Water, and all my Bones are out of joynt: My Heart
is like Wax, it is melted in the midſt of my bowels; my ſtrength
is dried up like a Potſherd, my tongue cleaveth to my Jaws, and
thou haſt brought me to the duſt of Death.</hi> Neither is this his
peculiar caſe, but the common effect of Spiritual Diſtreſſes,
<hi>Pſal. 39. 11. When thou with Rebukes doſt correct Man for Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
thou makeſt his beauty to conſume away like a Moth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. Being thus diſtreſſed for their Souls, they caſt off <hi>all care</hi>
of their Bodies, Eſtates, Families, and all their outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
whatſoever. And no wonder, for being perſwaded
that they have made <hi>Shipwrack</hi> of their Souls, they judg the
reſt are not <hi>worth the ſaving.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="407" facs="tcp:49412:216"/>
7. Giving all for loſt, they uſually caſt about for ſome
<hi>eaſe</hi> to their Minds, by ſeeking after the <hi>lower</hi> degrees of
Miſery, hearing, or ſuppoſing that all are not tormented
alike, they endeavour to perſwade themſelves of a <hi>Cooler Hell.</hi>
This if they could reach it, were but poor Comfort, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to their Satisfaction; but as poor as it is, it is uſually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to them, for while they judg themſelves to be the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Sinners,</hi> they cannot but adjudg themſelves to the <hi>greateſt
Torments:</hi> And theſe Endeavours being fruſtrated, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
back to themſelves, (as now hopeleſs of the leaſt caſe)
worſe than before. Now they fix themſelves upon the <hi>deep</hi>
contemplations of their Miſery: <hi>Oh</hi> (think they) <hi>how great
had our Happineſs been, if we had been made Toads, Serpents,
Worms, or any thing but Men! For then ſhould we never have
known this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappineſs; and this begets a thouſand vain wiſhes.
Oh that we had never been born! Or that Death could annihilate
us! Or that as ſoon as we had been born, we had died!</hi> (As <hi>Job</hi>
ſpeaks) Job. 3. 11, 12. <hi>Why died I not from the Womb? Why
did I not give up the ghoſt, when I came out of the belly?)
For then had we not contracted ſo much Guilt. Or that the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Hills could fall upon us, and cover us from the Face of
our Judge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. When all their Hopes are thus daſhed, and (like a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracked-Man
on a Plank) they are ſtill knocked down with
new Waves, all their endeavours being ſtill fruſtrated, they
ſeem to themſelves to be able to hold out no longer; then they
give over all further <hi>Enquiries,</hi> and the <hi>uſe of Means,</hi> they
refuſe to Pray, Read, Hear. They perceive (as <hi>Spira</hi> ſaid)
<hi>that they pray to their own Condemnation;</hi> and that all is to no
purpoſe. They are <hi>weary of their Groanings,</hi> Pſal. 6. 6. <hi>Their
Eyes fail with looking up;</hi> their <hi>Knees are feeble,</hi> their Hands hang
down. And as <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88. 4, 5. <hi>They count themſelves
with thoſe that go down to the Pit, free among the Dead, like the
ſlain that lie in the Grove,</hi> whom God <hi>remembreth no more.</hi> Thus
they lie down under their Burthen, and while they find it ſo
hard to be born, 'tis uſual for them to come to the utmoſt
point of <hi>Deſperateneſs.</hi> (Satan ſuggeſting and forwarding
them.) Sometimes they open their Mouths with complaints
againſt God, and blaſpheme. And (as the laſt part of the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:49412:217"/>
Tragedy) being weary of themſelves, they ſeek to put an
end to their preſent <hi>Miſery,</hi> by putting an end to their
<hi>Lives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have preſented you with Satan's Stratagems, againſt the
<hi>Peace</hi> of God's Children: the Remedies againſt theſe and other
Subtilties of our grand Enemy, I ſhall not offer you, becauſe
many others have done that already, to whoſe Writings I
muſt refer you. Some <hi>principal</hi> Directions I have pointed at
in the way, and in the General have done this for the help
of the Tempted, that I have endeavoured to ſhew them the
<hi>Methods</hi> of the Tempter, which is no <hi>ſmall help to preſerve</hi> Men
from being thus impoſed upon, and to <hi>recover</hi> out of his Snare
thoſe that are. 'Tis a great preſervative from Sickneſs, and
no mean advantage to the Cure, to have a diſcovery of the
Diſeaſe, and the Cauſes of it. I ſhall conclude theſe Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
with a Caution or two.</p>
                     <p>1. Let none think worſe of the <hi>ſerious Practice</hi> of holy ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in Religion, becauſe theſe Spiritual Diſtreſſes do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
befal thoſe that are conſcientiouſly careful in the Ways
of God, while the prophane and negligent Profeſſors, are
ſtrangers to ſuch Trials. Theſe Troubles are indeed very ſad;
but a ſenſleſs, careleſs State is <hi>far worſe:</hi> theſe Troubles of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<hi>end very Comfortably,</hi> whereas the other end (except God
make them ſenſible, by Conviction of their ſin and danger)
in that <hi>real Miſery,</hi> the fears whereof occaſion theſe Sorrows
to God's Children. And the danger of Spiritual <hi>Troubles</hi> is
not ſo great as is that of an <hi>hardned</hi> Heart, (nay, God fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
makes uſe of them to prevent eternal Ruine) <hi>for one</hi>
that goes <hi>roaring</hi> to the Pit, there are <hi>thouſands</hi> that go <hi>laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to Hell.</p>
                     <p>2. Let none <hi>ſlight,</hi> or ſcoff at theſe Tremendous Judgments.
'Tis too common with Men, either to aſcribe Spiritual Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to <hi>Melancholy,</hi> as if none were ever thus concerned, but
ſuch, as by too much ſeriouſneſs in Religion, are <hi>become Mad,</hi>
(a fair pretence for Careleſsneſs) or to a whining <hi>Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
To the former I have ſaid ſomething before, and as for
the latter, I ſhall only reply in the words of <hi>Spira,</hi> to one that
objected Hypocriſie to him: <hi>I am a Caſt-away, a Veſſel of
Wrath, yet dare you call it Diſſembling and Frenzy, and can mock
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:49412:217"/>
at the formidable example of the heavy Wrath of God, that ſhould
teach you Fear and Terrour? But 'tis natural to the Fleſh to ſpeak
(either out of malice or ignorance) perverſly of the Work of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Let none be afraid of this</hi> Goliah, let no Man's heart faint
becauſe of him. A fear of <hi>caution</hi> and diligence to avoid his
Snares, is a neceſſary Duty, <hi>(Be ſober, be vigilant, becauſe your
adverſary the Devil,</hi> &amp;c.) but a <hi>diſcouraging</hi> diſtruſtful Fear,
is a diſhonourable <hi>reflection</hi> upon God's Power and Promiſes
to help us, and upon the Captain of our Salvation, who
goeth out before us: Let us hold on in the practice of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and not be afraid. The God of Peace ſhall tread down
Satan under our feet ſhortly. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>The firſt Verſe ſets down ſeveral remarkable

of weight and worth. As</p>

Emergency,</hi> but as <hi>particularly</hi> made <hi>choice</hi> of both by God and
Satan, being moſt fit and proper for the <hi>deſign</hi> which each of them
were carrying on. This is expreſly noted in <hi>Mat. 4. 1. Then was
Jeſus led up:</hi> but more fully in <hi>Mark 1. 12. Immediately the Spirit
driveth him into the Wilderneſs;</hi> Manifeſtly directing us to expect
ſomething worthy of our Obſervation in that circumſtance: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49412:220"/>
can we miſs of it, when the things unto which this directs
us, are ſo fully related immediately before. For we find in both theſe
Evangeliſts, (which ſpeak ſo exactly of the time of theſe Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was baptized of <hi>John;</hi> this was in order to the
fulfilling the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of his <hi>Office.</hi> As the <hi>Prieſts</hi> under the
Law when they came to be <hi>thirty years old,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Numb. 4. 3.</note> entred upon their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

(that he might anſwer his Type) beginning to be about <hi>thirty
years of Age,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Levit. 8. 6. 12.</note> was ſolemnly inaugurated into the great Office of
the <hi>Mediatorſhip</hi> by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 23.</note> and the <hi>extraordinary</hi> deſcending of the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> by which <hi>he was anointed with the Oyl of gladneſs above

Teſtimony concerning him; <hi>This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Immediately after this was he carried to
the place of Combate. Hence we may infer,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That our entring upon a ſpecial Service for God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>or receiving a ſpecial
Favour from God; are two Solemn Seaſons which Satan makes uſe of
for Temptation.</hi> Often theſe two Seaſons <hi>meet</hi> together in the ſame
<hi>Perſon,</hi> at the ſame <hi>time. Paul</hi> after his rapture into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 2, 7.</note> which (as ſome conceive) was alſo upon his entrance upon
the Miniſtry, was buffeted by the Meſſenger of Satan.</p>
                     <p>Sometime theſe two Seaſons are <hi>ſevered;</hi> yet ſtill it may be
obſerved, that the Devil watcheth them. When any Servant of
God is to engage in any particular employment, he will be upon
him. He Aſſaulted <hi>Moſes</hi> by perſecution, when he was firſt called
to deliver <hi>Iſrael.</hi> As ſoon as <hi>David</hi> was Anointed, immediately
doth he enrage the Minds of <hi>Saul</hi> and his Courtiers againſt him.
It was ſo ordinary with <hi>Luther,</hi> that he at laſt came to this, that
before any <hi>Eminent Service,</hi> he conſtantly expected either a <hi>fit</hi> of
<hi>Sickneſs,</hi> or <hi>the buffetings of Satan.</hi> He is no leſs ſedulous in
giving his Aſſaults when any Child of God hath been under pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Favours, or Enjoyments: The <hi>Church</hi> after an high enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
with <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 1, 2.</note> is preſently overcome by a careleſs ſleepy
indiſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>Though this may ſeem ſtrange, yet the harſhneſs of ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
on <hi>God's part,</hi> and the boldneſs of the attempt on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
part,</hi> may be much taken off by the conſideration of the
reaſons hereof.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, On <hi>Satan's part:</hi> It is no great wonder to ſee ſuch an
undertaking, when we conſider his Fury, and Malice. The more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49412:220"/>
we receive from God, and the more we are to <hi>do</hi> for him, the
more doth he <hi>malign</hi> us. So much the more as God is Good, by
ſo much is his Eye Evil.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There are (in ſuch caſes as theſe) ſeveral <hi>advantages,</hi>
which (through our weakneſs and imperfection) we are too apt
to give him; and for theſe he lieth at the catch.</p>
                     <p>As firſt, <hi>Security.</hi> We are apt to grow proud, careleſs, and
confident after, or upon ſuch Employments and Favours; even as
men are apt to ſleep or ſurfeit upon a full Meal, or to forget
themſelves,<note place="margin">Job 29. 18.</note> when they are advanced to Honour. <hi>Job's</hi> great
Peace and Plenty made him (as he confeſſeth) ſo confident, that
he concluded he ſhould <hi>die in his Neſt. David</hi> enjoying the Favour
of God in a more than ordinary meaſure, (though he was more
acquainted with viciſſitudes and changes than moſt of men) grows
ſecure in this apprehenſion,<note place="margin">Pſal. 30. 6.</note> that he <hi>ſhould never be moved:</hi> but he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
his miſtake, and leaves it upon Record as an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
neceſſary for others to take warning by, that when he became
warm under the Beams of God's Countenance, then he was apt
to fall into Security. And (this it ſeems was uſual with him in
all ſuch caſes) when he was moſt ſecure, he was neareſt ſome
trouble, or diſquiet: <hi>Thou didſt hide thy Face,</hi> (and then to be
ſure the Devil will ſhew his) <hi>and I was troubled.</hi> Enjoyments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
Confidence; Confidence brings forth Careleſneſs; Careleſneſs
makes God withdraw, and gives opportunity to Satan to work
unſeen. And thus as Armies after Victory growing ſecure, are
oft ſurprized; So are we oft after our Spiritual Advancements
thrown down.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Diſcouragement,</hi> and tergiverſation is another thing
the Devil watcheth for. By his Aſſaults he repreſents the Duty
difficult, tedious, dangerous, or impoſſible, on purpoſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
us, and to make us fall back. No ſooner doth <hi>Paul</hi> engage
in the Goſpel, than the Devil is upon him, ſuggeſting ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
as he knew were moſt prevalent with our frail natures; if he
had not been aware of him,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16.</note> and refuſed to hearken to what Fleſh
and Blood would have ſaid in the Caſe. When God honoured
<hi>Moſes</hi> with the high Employment of delivering <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the hazard
and danger of the work was ſo ſtrongly fixed upon his thoughts,
that he makes many excuſes; one while pleading his <hi>Inability</hi>
and Inſufficiency;<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Who am I, that I ſhould go to Pharaoh?</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
while he urgeth <hi>Iſraels unbelief,</hi> and a ſeeming Impoſſibility to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49412:221"/>
ſatisfy them of his Commiſſion;<note place="margin">Exod. 4. 1.</note> After that he deviſeth another
ſhift, <hi>I am not Eloquent,</hi> in the <hi>10th verſe.</hi> And when all theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges
were removed, (Satan had ſo affrighted him with the
trouble and difficulty of this undertaking,) that he attempts to
<hi>break</hi> away from his duty;<note place="margin">ver. 13.</note> ver. 13. <hi>Send by the hand of him whom
thou wilt ſend;</hi> That is, ſpare me and ſend another: and till the
anger and diſpleaſure of God was manifeſted againſt him, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
not. In <hi>Jonah</hi> the Temptation went higher. He (upon
the apprehenſions mentioned) <hi>ran away</hi> from his Service, and puts
God to convince him by an extraordinary puniſhment. And
when Satan prevails not ſo far, as <hi>wholly</hi> to deter men by ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets;
yet at leaſt he doth <hi>diſhearten</hi> and diſcourage them: So that
the work loſeth much of that Glory, Excellency, and Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which a ready and chearful undertaking would put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly; The <hi>Fall</hi> or miſcarriage of the Saints at ſuch times is of
more than ordinary <hi>diſadvantage;</hi> not only to <hi>others,</hi> (for if they
can be prevailed with to lay aſide their work, or to neglect the
Improvement of their Favours, others are deprived of the benefit
and help that might be expected from them) but alſo to <hi>themſelves.</hi>
A prevailing Temptation doth more than ordinarily prejudice
them at ſuch times. The greatneſs of the diſappointment under
ſpecial Service, the unworthy neglect, and unanſwerableneſs to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Favours are <hi>Extraordinary Provocations,</hi> and produce more than
ordinary <hi>Chaſtiſments;</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Jonah's</hi> Affliction, and the <hi>Spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
deſertion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; As we have ſeen the reaſon of <hi>Satan's Keenneſs</hi> in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thoſe Opportunities; So may we conſider the reaſons of <hi>God's
Permiſſion,</hi> which are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Temptations at ſuch Seaſons are permitted for more
eminent <hi>tryal</hi> of the upright. On this account was <hi>Job</hi> tempted.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, For an <hi>increaſe</hi> of diligence, humility and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
If theſe Priviledges and Mercies will not diſcourage Satan,
what will? And if Satan ſo openly malign ſuch Enjoyments, we
may be <hi>awakened</hi> to hold them <hi>faſter;</hi> and ſet a <hi>double Guard</hi> upon
them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, For a plentiful <hi>Furniture</hi> of <hi>Experience.</hi> Temptation
is the Shop of Experience. <hi>Luther</hi> was ſo great a gainer by this,
that he became able ſo to ſpeak to the <hi>Conſciences</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> of
his hearers, that the <hi>thoughts</hi> of their hearts were <hi>manifeſted</hi> by his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49412:221"/>
ſpeaking; as if he had had an <hi>Intilligencer</hi> in their own <hi>Boſoms.</hi>
Hence did he commend <hi>Prayer, Meditation,</hi> and <hi>Temptation,</hi> as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
requiſites for the accompliſhment of a Miniſter.</p>
                     <p>This may adminiſter matter of Counſel to us in <hi>both caſes</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.
<note place="margin">Applic.</note> If we be put upon eminent <hi>Employments,</hi> or receive
eminent <hi>Favours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, We muſt not be ſo ſecure as to think Satan will be aſleep
that while, or that we are beyond danger. While we are
<hi>receiving</hi> Kindneſſes, he is <hi>deviſing</hi> Plots, and laying Snares.
With Priviledges and Mercies expect Exerciſes and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in particular; We may receive ſomething of advice
from this conſideration, in reference to <hi>both</hi> Caſes. 1. If God is
about to <hi>employ</hi> us in any Service, (1.) We have little need to be
<hi>confident</hi> of our abilities, or performance, when we know that
Temptations <hi>wait</hi> for us. (2.) We muſt not only be ſenſible of
our weakneſs, that we be not confident; but we muſt be <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive</hi>
of the <hi>Strength</hi> and Power of God to carry us through,
that we be not <hi>diſcouraged.</hi> (3.) We muſt ſee our <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> that
we may be <hi>watchful;</hi> and yet muſt we refuſe to give it the leaſt
place of conſideration in our <hi>debates</hi> of Duty; leſt it <hi>ſway</hi> us
againſt Duty, or <hi>diſhearten</hi> us in it. 2. If God be pleaſed to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
us with peculiar <hi>Favours.</hi> Then (1.) Though we muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them to the full, yet muſt we not feed on them <hi>without
fear.</hi> (2.) We muſt not ſtay in the Enjoyment, or play with the
Token; but look to the <hi>tendency</hi> of ſuch Favours, and improve
them to duty, as to their proper end.</p>

                     <p>THe ſecond <hi>Circumſtance</hi> acquaints <hi>how Chriſt</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried
to the Combate. In Solemn Combates and
Duels, the Perſons undertaking the Fight, were uſually
carried to the place with great <hi>Solemnity</hi> and <hi>Ceremony:
Chriſt</hi> in this Spiritual Battel is deſcribed, as having the <hi>conduct</hi> of
the Spirit, <hi>He was led up of the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> What this Spirit was,
is (though by a needleſs and over-officious diligence) queſtioned
by ſome: but we need not ſtay much upon it, if we conſider the
phraſe of the <hi>Evangeliſts;</hi> who mention <hi>Spirit</hi> without any <hi>Note</hi>
of Diſtinction: (which of neceſſity muſt have been added, if it had
intended, either his <hi>proper</hi> Spirit as Man; or the <hi>wicked</hi> Spirit
Satan) directing thereby, to underſtand it of him to whom the
word <hi>Spirit</hi> is more peculiarly attributed; <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
Or if we obſerve the cloſe <hi>connexion</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> betwixt that Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſt's <hi>being full of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and his being <hi>led by the
Spirit,</hi> it will be out of controverſy, that the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is here
intended. Hence was it that <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlates it more fully; <hi>Jeſus
being full of the Holy Ghoſt, was led, eodem Spiritu, of the ſame Spirit;</hi>
and the <hi>Syriack</hi> in <hi>Matthew</hi> doubts not to expreſs it by the <hi>Holy
Spirit:</hi> And what elſe can be imagined? When in this Text the
<hi>Spirit</hi> that <hi>led</hi> him up, and the <hi>Devil</hi> that <hi>tempted,</hi> are mentioned
in ſo direct an oppoſition. <hi>He was led of the Spirit into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

things to their minds, or by <hi>infuſing</hi> evil <hi>Inclinations,</hi> or by any
<hi>proper compliance</hi> with Satan to undermine, and delude us by any
treachery or deceit; none of theſe can be imagined without appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
derogation to the holineſs of God, <hi>who tempteth no man, neither
can he be tempted with evil:</hi> But what we are to underſtand by the
<hi>Holy Spirit's</hi> concerning himſelf in temptations, is included in theſe
particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, God gives <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to Satan; without which his hand
would be ſealed up under an impoſſibility of reaching it out againſt
any.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Opportunities</hi> and occaſions do depend upon his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi>
without which nothing comes to paſs. Neither we nor
any thing elſe, do or can move without him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Spirit <hi>overſees</hi> the Temptation as to <hi>Meaſure,</hi>
and <hi>Continuance;</hi> The length and breadth of it is ordered by
him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The <hi>iſſue</hi> and conſequences of every Temptation are at
his appointment; The ways of its working for our Exerciſe, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
or Conviction, or for any other good and advantage
whatſoever, they all belong to his determination.</p>
                     <p>So that it is not improper to aſſert, that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> do <hi>concur</hi>
in the ſame temptation; though the <hi>ways</hi> of proceeding, with the
<hi>aims</hi> and <hi>intentions</hi> of both, be <hi>directly different</hi> and contrary.
Hence is it, that the Temptation of <hi>David, 1 Sam.</hi> 24. 1. and
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1. are upon <hi>ſeveral regards,</hi> attributed both to God
and Satan.</p>
                     <p>This note is of uſe,<note place="margin">Appl. 1.</note> to remove thoſe harſh <hi>Interpretations</hi> which
poor tempted Chriſtians meet withal, commonly, from ſuch as
have not touched their burdens with the leaſt of their Fingers. Men
are apt in theſe caſes to judg,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>Ways of Religion,</hi> as being ways (at leaſt in the more
ſerious and rigid practice of them) of intolerable <hi>hazard</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity;
and only upon an Obſervation, <hi>That thoſe who moſt addict
themſelves to a true and ſtrict obſervance of Duty and Command, uſually
complain of Temptations; and expreſs ſometimes their fears and diſtreſs
of heart about them.</hi> This is your Reading, your Praying and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49412:223"/>
Such Preaching (ſay they) leads men to diſpair, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
diſquiet; And upon the whole, they conclude it dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to be religious above the <hi>common rate</hi> of thoſe that proſecute it
in a ſlow and careleſs <hi>indifferency.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The like Severity of Cenſure do they uſe in reference
to the Spiritual <hi>State</hi> of the tempted; as if they were <hi>Veſſels of his
hatred;</hi> and ſuch as were by him given up to the power of this
<hi>Wild Boar</hi> of the <hi>Forreſt</hi> to devour and tear. All kind of diſtreſſes
are obnoxious to the worſt of misjudgings from malevolent minds.
The Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> produced this cenſorious Scoff, <hi>Let God
deliver him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 71. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>if he will have him. Davids</hi> troubles eaſily induced his
Adverſaries to conclude that <hi>God had forſaken him, and that there
was none to deliver him.</hi> But in troubles of this nature (where eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
there are frightful complaining againſt themſelves) men
are more eaſily drawn out to be peremptory in their uncharitable
determinations concerning them. Becauſe the trouble it ſelf is
ſomewhat <hi>rare,</hi> and apt to beget <hi>hideous Impreſſions:</hi> and withall
the <hi>vent</hi> which the afflicted parties give by their bemoaning of
their Eſtate, in hope to eaſe themſelves thereby, is but taken as a
<hi>Teſtimony</hi> againſt themſelves, and the undoubted <hi>Ecchoes</hi> of their
real feelings.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Their <hi>Sins</hi> are upon this Ground misjudged and
heightned. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nuſual Troubles</hi> with common Appreh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">Acts 28. 4.</note> The Viper upon <hi>Paul's</hi> hand, made the <hi>Barbarians</hi>

<hi>David's</hi> Sickneſs was enough to give his Enemies occaſion
to ſurmiſe that it was the puniſhment of ſome great Tranſgreſſion.
<hi>An evil diſeaſe,</hi>

<hi>Pilate</hi> mixed with their Sacrifices, were judged <hi>greateſt Sinners.</hi>
But in <hi>inward</hi> Temptations, this misjudging confidence is every
way more heightned; and thoſe that are <hi>moſt moleſted</hi> are ſuppoſed
to have given <hi>more way</hi> to Satan.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Temptations are alſo misjudged to be <hi>worſe</hi> than they
are. They are indeed things to be trembled at; but they are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
of an aſtoniſhing, amazing or diſpairing conſideration: as
men areapt to think that view the workings of them at a diſtance.</p>
                     <p>Againſt all thoſe unrighteous ſurmiſes, the poor afflicted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Chriſt may have relief from this truth in hand, That the
<hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God hath a <hi>hand</hi> in Temptations: and therefore it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49412:223"/>
is impoſſible, that every where they ſhould be of ſuch a <hi>Signification.</hi>
Were they in themſelves no way <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to God's Glory in the
Gracious Exerciſe of his Children, the Spirit of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
would not at all have a <hi>hand</hi> in them. If under Satan's Aſſaults
you meet with thoſe that by ſuch a harſhneſs of Cenſure, would
<hi>aggravate</hi> your troubles, and ſo <hi>grieve</hi> thoſe whom God hath ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
you may boldly appeal from them to him that judgeth
righteouſly. And indeed if men would but conſider in the ſaddeſt
caſe of this nature, either 1. The <hi>End</hi> of the Lord in permitting
Temptations which (if ſeen) would give an high juſtification
of his dealing; and force men to applaud and magnify his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
rather than to cenſure it. Or, 2. If they could but ſee the
<hi>ſecret ways</hi> of God's <hi>Support.</hi> How he acts his part, in <hi>holding</hi> them
by the hand, in <hi>counterworking</hi> of Satan, and <hi>confounding</hi> him under
the exerciſe of his higheſt malice; and alſo in the ways of his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi>
and <hi>deliverance.</hi> Or, 3. If the <hi>harmleſneſs</hi> of Temptations
when their <hi>ſting</hi> is taken out were but weighted, men would
change their minds as readily, as the <hi>Barbarians</hi> did, when they
ſaw the Viper not effect that miſchief they ſuppoſed upon <hi>Paul;</hi>
And would ſee cauſe to ſtand amazed at the contrivances of <hi>ſo
much</hi> Power and Wiſdom, as can turn theſe to quite <hi>other ends and
uſes,</hi> than what they of <hi>themſelves</hi> ſeem to threaten.</p>
                     <p>This Conſideration will further expreſs its uſefulneſs,<note place="margin">Appl. 2.</note> in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting</hi>
us under Temptations. It might have been <hi>Paul's</hi> great
diſcouragement,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 16.</note> that in his anſwer before <hi>Nero</hi> no man ſtood
with him: But this was his ſupport, that <hi>God was with him.</hi> The
like encouragement we have under all Aſſaults of Satan, that we
are not <hi>left</hi> to our ſelves, but the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is with us; and
that he concerns himſelf on a <hi>deſign</hi> to <hi>over-ſee,</hi> and <hi>over-rule</hi> his
work, and to put a <hi>check</hi> upon him when there is need. So that
he cannot tempt <hi>as</hi> he will, nor <hi>when</hi> he will, nor in <hi>what</hi> he
would, nor as <hi>long</hi> as he would; but that in all caſes, we may
rely upon the great Maſter-contriver, for relief, help, mitigation,
or deliverance; as there is need.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In that the</hi> Evangeliſts <hi>do not ſay that Chriſt caſt himſelf upon
a Temptation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>neither did go to undertake it, till he was</hi> led <hi>to it,
we note,</hi> That whatever may be the advantage of a Temptation by the
Spirits ordering of it; or what ſecurity from danger we may promiſe to
our ſelves upon that account, yet muſt we not run upon Temptations;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49412:224"/>
though we muſt ſubmit when we are fairly led into them. <hi>The reaſons
of this truth are theſe:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, There is ſo much of the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>evil</hi> in Temptations that
they are to be avoided if poſſible. Good they may <hi>accidentally</hi> be,
(that is beyond their proper nature and tendency) by the <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling</hi>
hand of God; but being in their own <hi>natural conſtitution</hi>
evil, 'tis inconſiſtent with <hi>humane</hi> nature to <hi>deſire</hi> them <hi>as ſuch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, To <hi>run</hi> upon them would be a dangerous <hi>tempting</hi> of
God, (that is) making a bold and preſumptuous trial (without
call) whether he will put forth his power to reſcue us or not.
<hi>Now he that runs upon a Temptation hath no promiſe to be delivered out
of it.</hi> And beſides, runs upon ſo deſperate a <hi>provocation,</hi> that in
all probability he ſhall <hi>miſcarry</hi> in it, as a juſt puniſhment of his
<hi>raſhneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Enquiry may be made,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> When do men run (uncalled and)
unwarrantably upon Temptation? I Anſwer, many ways. As</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> When men engage themſelves in Sin and <hi>apparent</hi> Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
in the Works of the Fleſh. For it can never be imagined
that the Holy God ſhould ever by his Spirit call any to ſuch things
as his Soul abhors.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When men run upon the <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>apparent occaſions
and cauſes</hi> of Sin. This is like a man's going to the Peſt-houſe,
thus do they, that though they deſign not to be actors in evil, yet
will give their <hi>Company</hi> and Countenance to Perſons <hi>actually enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged</hi>
in evil.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When men <hi>unneceſſarily</hi> (without the conduct either
of command, or urging an unavoidable Providence) do put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(though not upon <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> opportunities, yet) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>hazardous</hi> occaſions and ſnares. <hi>Peter</hi> had no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
in the High-Prieſt's Hall; his curioſity led him thither; he
might eaſily have foreſeen a probable Snare; but confidently put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelf forward, where his <hi>danger</hi> was <hi>more</hi> than his <hi>buſineſs,</hi>
he ran upon the Temptation, and accordingly fell. The like
did <hi>Dinah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 34. 1.</note> when ſhe made a <hi>needleſs</hi> Vagary to ſee the Daughters
of the Land; where ſhe met with her Sin and Shame. Neither
do they otherwiſe, who dare adventure themſelves <hi>in Families</hi>
(whilſt yet they are free and may otherwiſe diſpoſe of themſelves)
where they <hi>ſee</hi> Snares and Temptations will be <hi>laid</hi> before them.
The Caſe indeed is otherwiſe to thoſe that are under the <hi>neceſſary</hi>
engagement of <hi>relation, natural,</hi> or voluntary, (if it be antecedent
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49412:224"/>
to the hazard) to live in ſuch places or callings,<note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 11.</note> they have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
promiſe of preſervation than others can lay claim to.<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 29.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Thoſe run upon Temptation, that adventure <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently</hi>
beyond their <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and put themſelves upon actions good
or harmleſs, diſproportionably to their abilities. The Apoſtle
gives the inſtance in <hi>Marriage-Abſtinence, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 5. which he
cautions may not be undertaken at a <hi>careleſs adventure,</hi> for fear of
a Temptation: and by this may we judg other things of like
nature.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, They are alſo guilty, that deſign an <hi>adventure</hi> unto the
<hi>utmoſt bounds</hi> of lawful <hi>Liberty.</hi> Thoſe that have a mind to try
concluſions, how near they may make their approaches to Sin,
and yet keep off from the defilement; ſuch as would divide a
<hi>hair</hi> betwixt good and evil, have at beſt but a <hi>hair's breadth</hi> betwixt
them and Sin; But how eaſily are they brought over that. Like
a man that walks upon the utmoſt <hi>Verge</hi> of a River's brink, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
meets with <hi>hollow ground,</hi> and a dangerous <hi>ſlip</hi> before he is
aware.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Thoſe alſo may be reckoned in the number of ſuch as
ruſh upon their danger, who go abroad without their <hi>weapons,</hi> and
forget in the midſt of <hi>dayly</hi> dangers, the <hi>means</hi> of preſervation.
<hi>Thomas</hi> by his neglect ſlid into a greater unbelief than the reſt of
the <hi>Apoſtles. David's</hi> unwatchful heart was eaſily ſmitten by the
Intelligence which his Eyes brought him. They that would plead
their Innocency againſt Temptation, had need to carry their
arms, and preſervatives ſtill with them.</p>
                     <p>This truth is a ſufficient caution againſt the raſh <hi>adventurouſneſs</hi>
of thoſe who forwardly engage themſelves in matters of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<note place="margin">Applic.</note> As the former obſervation told us, Temptations are not to
be <hi>feared;</hi> So this alſo tells, they are not to be <hi>ſlighted.</hi> The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> when the <hi>Ark</hi> came among them, is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Imitation</hi> to us. We may <hi>tremble</hi> juſtly when we hear of
their approach; but our Hazard ſhould be the <hi>Whet-Stone</hi> of our
Courage; and our danger ſhould bring us to reſolves of a more
<hi>ſtout</hi> reſiſtance, that we may <hi>quit our ſelves like men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. ſeems to imply (when he tell thoſe
that were more ſevere and careleſs of others, that <hi>they may alſo
be tempted)</hi> that the beſt of men do little know what a <hi>change</hi> a
Temptation may make upon them; a <hi>ſmall</hi> Temptation may be
too <hi>ſtrong</hi> for them, and may carry them to what they never <hi>thought</hi>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49412:225"/>
of, nay, may break down the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> of their reſolves, and ſnap
their purpoſes as a Thread in a flame. It did ſo with <hi>Peter,</hi> who
was quickly <hi>overcome</hi> by that which he had with ſo much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<hi>undervalued.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. III. The Third Circumſtance, the place of the Combat. The

                     <p>THe Third Circumſtance (next to be conſidered) is the
<hi>place</hi> of this Combat, <hi>the Wilderneſs.</hi> To enquire
what or where this Wilderneſs was, is not only imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
and uſeleſs, (as to any thing we can obſerve

where 'tis ſaid, <hi>he was with the Wild Beaſts;</hi> noting thereby a
<hi>deſolate</hi> and dangerous Solitude, far remote from humane Society
and comfort.</p>
                     <p>'Tis much more our concern to ſeek after the reaſons of his
choice of that place, or rather among theſe many that are given to
ſatisfy our ſelves with, what may have the greateſt appearance of
Truth. They that think Chriſt hereby deſigned to ſhew the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain

other, ſeem not to attend to the <hi>true deſign</hi> of the choice of this
place; which notwithſtanding is evidently diſcovered to have
been done in <hi>order</hi> to the <hi>Temptation. He was led into the Wilderneſs
to be tempted.</hi> The place then was ſubſervient to the conflict, as
the proper <hi>Theater</hi> on which ſo great a Conteſt was to be acted;
And if we ſhall but mind what ſpecial conſideration was to be had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49412:225"/>
of ſuch a place (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> howling deſolate Wilderneſs) which may
with eaſe pitch upon theſe following reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It pleaſed God to have an Eye to the <hi>glory</hi> of Chriſt's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
when in a <hi>ſingle</hi> Combat he ſhould ſo remarkably foil the
Devil without any the leaſt advantage on his part; there being
none that might be the leaſt Support or Encouragement to
him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The condition of the place, gave <hi>riſe</hi> to the firſt
Temptation. For in that he <hi>hungred</hi> in a <hi>barren Wilderneſs,</hi> it
gave <hi>occaſion</hi> to Satan to tempt him more ſtrongly to <hi>turn Stones
into Bread.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In the choice of ſuch a place, God ſeems to offer Satan
a ſpecial <hi>advantage</hi> in tempting; which was the <hi>Solitude</hi> and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his preſent condition.</p>
                     <p>To omit the two former Conſiderations (as not altogether ſo
uſeful, further than what I ſhall be engaged to ſpeak to afterwards)
this laſt affords this Obſervation:</p>
                     <p>That Solitude affords a great advantage to Satan in the matter of
Temptation.<note place="margin">Obſ. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>This advantage ariſeth from Solitude two ways:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, As it doth deprive us of <hi>help.</hi> So great and many are the
bleſſed helps ariſing from the Society and Communion of ſuch as
fear the Lord, (as Counſel, Comfort, Encouragement from their
Graces, Experiences, and Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> that the Woe pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to him <hi>that is alone,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 4. 10.</note> is not groundleſs. Chriſtians in an holy
Combination can do more <hi>work;</hi> and ſo have a good <hi>reward</hi> for
their Labour. They can mutually <hi>help</hi> one another when they
<hi>fall,</hi> they can mutually <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>warm</hi> one another; they can
alſo <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> one another's hands to prevail againſt an Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
He then that is alone, being deprived of theſe advantages,
lyeth more open to the ſtroke of Temptation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Solitude increaſeth <hi>Melancholy,</hi> fills the Soul with
<hi>diſmal</hi> apprehenſions; and withal doth ſo ſpoil and alter the <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
of it, that it is not only ready to take any diſadvantageous <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi>
but it doth alſo diſpoſe it to <hi>leaven,</hi> and ſowre thoſe very
conſiderations that ſhould <hi>ſupport;</hi> and to put a bad conſtruction
on things that never were intended for its hurt.</p>
                     <p>This may warn us,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> to take heed of giving Satan ſo great an
advantage againſt us, as an <hi>unneceſſary</hi> Solitude may do. I know
there are <hi>times</hi> and <hi>occaſions</hi> that do juſtly require it, to ſeek a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary

                     <head>CHAP. IV. The Fourth Circumſtance, The end wherefore Chriſt was

Exempt not from Temptation. Of Temptations
that leave not Impreſſions of Sin behind them. How
Satan's Temptations are diſtinguiſhed from the Luſts of
our own Heart.</head>
                     <p>THe Fourth Circumſtance was the <hi>End.</hi> There was no other
deſign in the main of Chriſts being led up, and into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
but that he might be <hi>tempted.</hi> In this two things ſeem
to be matter of equal wonder.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Why Chriſt would <hi>ſubmit</hi> to be tempted. For this, many
great and weighty reaſons may be given: As</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Thus was Chriſt <hi>evidenced</hi> to be the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> and the
Seed of the Woman. His being tempted, and in ſuch a manner,
doth clearly ſatisfy us that he was <hi>true man;</hi> and that in <hi>that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
he it was that was promiſed <hi>to break the Serpents head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, This was a fair <hi>preludium</hi> and <hi>earneſt</hi> of that <hi>final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt</hi>
over Satan, and the breaking down of his power.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There was a more peculiar aim in God by theſe means
of Temptation to qualify him with <hi>pity and power</hi> to help; <hi>For in
that he ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Heb.</hi> 2. 18. And having Experience of Temptation himſelf,
be became a merciful High-Prieſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15.</note> apt to be <hi>touched with the feeling
of our Infirmities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49412:226"/>
Fourthly, The <hi>Conſequence</hi> of this experimental compaſſion in
Chriſt, was a further reaſon why he ſubmitted to be tempted, to
wit, that we might have the greater <hi>comfort and encouragement,</hi> in
the expectancy of <hi>tender</hi> dealing from him. Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. invites to <hi>come boldly to the Throne of Grace</hi> at any
<hi>time of need.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, A further end God ſeemed to have in this, <hi>viz.</hi> To
give a ſignal and remarkable <hi>Inſtance</hi> to us of the <hi>nature</hi> of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
of Satan's <hi>Subtilty,</hi> his <hi>Impudency,</hi> of the <hi>uſual</hi> Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which we may expect; as alſo to teach us what <hi>Weapons</hi> are
neceſſary for reſiſtance; and in what <hi>manner</hi> we muſt manage
them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It ſeems as ſtrange that Satan would <hi>undertake</hi> a
thing ſo unfeaſible and hopeleſs, as the tempting of Chriſt. What
expectation could he have to prevail againſt him, who was
<hi>Anointed with the Oyl of Gladneſs above his Fellows?</hi> Some An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That Satan might poſſibly <hi>doubt</hi> whether Chriſt were
the <hi>Son of God</hi> or no. But the Improbability of this I ſhall ſpeak
of afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Others attribute it to his <hi>Malice,</hi> which indeed is
great, and might poſſibly blind him to a deſperate undertaking.
But,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, We may juſtly apprehend, the <hi>power of Sin</hi> over Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
to be ſo great that it might <hi>enforce</hi> him to the bold attempt of
ſuch a wickedneſs. We ſee daily, that wicked men by the force of
their own wicked Principles, are <hi>reſtleſly hurried</hi> upon Acts of Sin,
though they <hi>know</hi> the Prohibition, and are not ignorant of the
threatned Danger. Satan is as great a Slave to his own internal
corrupt Principles as any. And whatſoever blind fury is ſtirred
up in Man by the power of his luſt, we may very well ſuppoſe the
like in Satan.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There is a <hi>Superior hand</hi> upon the Devil, that <hi>Sways,
Limits,</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> him in his Temptations. He cannot tempt
<hi>when</hi> he would; neither always <hi>what</hi> he would; but in his own
curſed inclinations and the acting of them, he is forced to be
<hi>ſubſervient</hi> to God's Deſigns. And in this particular, (whatever
might be Satan's proper End or Principle) it is evident that God
carried on a Gracious Deſign for the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> of his
Children.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49412:227"/>
The End of Chriſt's going to the Wilderneſs, being that he
might be tempted; if together with this, the <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of Chriſt in reſpect of his <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> be conſidered, we
may note from it.</p>
                     <p>That neither height of Priviledg,<note place="margin">Obſ. 5.</note> nor Eminency of Employment, nor
Holineſs of Perſon, will diſcourage Satan from Tempting, or ſecure any
from his Aſſaults. <hi>The beſt of men in the higheſt attainments may
expect Temptations. Grace it ſelf doth not exempt them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For firſt, None of theſe Priviledges <hi>in us,</hi> nor Eminencies of
Grace want <hi>matter</hi> to fix a Temptation upon. The weakneſſes
of the beſt of Men are ſuch, that a Temptation is not rendred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
as to the Succeſs, by their Graces: Nay, there are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<hi>Occaſions,</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi> in them, to encourage Temptations
of Pride, and Neglect. He found indeed nothing in Chriſt that
might offer the leaſt probability of prevalency; but in the Beſt of
Men, in their beſt Eſtate, he can find ſome encouragement for
his attempts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, None of us are beyond the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of ſuch <hi>Exerciſes.</hi>
It cannot be ſaid that we need them not; or that there may not
be holy ends wherefore God ſhould not permit and order them for
<hi>our Good.</hi> Temptations (as they are in God's diſpoſal) are a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
ſpiritual <hi>Phyſick;</hi> the deſign of them is to <hi>humble</hi> us, <hi>to
prove</hi> us,<note place="margin">Deut. 8. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>and to do us good in the latter End.</hi> Nothing will work
more of <hi>Care,</hi> Watchfulneſs, Diligence and Fear in a Gracious
Heart, than a ſence of Satan's deſignment againſt it. Nothing
puts a man more to <hi>Prayer,</hi> breathing after God, deſiring to be
diſſolved, and running to Chriſt, than the troubleſome and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
purſuits of Satan; Nothing brings men more from the <hi>love</hi>
of the World, and to a <hi>delight</hi> in the Ordinances of God, than
the trouble which here abides them unavoidably from Satan.
This diſcipline the beſt have need of; There are ſuch <hi>remainders</hi> of
Pride, and other Evils in them, that if God ſhould not permit
theſe <hi>Pricks</hi> and <hi>Thornes</hi> to humble them,<note place="margin">Non nobis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedit eſſe ſine tentationibus; non rogamus ut non tente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, ſed ne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducat in tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem. <hi>Aug.</hi> in Pſal. 73.</note> and thereby alſo awaken
them to laborious watchfulneſs; they would be careleſs, ſecure,
and ſadly declining. This made <hi>Auguſtine</hi> conclude that it was
no way <hi>expedient</hi> that we ſhould <hi>want</hi> Temptations; and that
Chriſt taught us as much, when he directed us, not to pray that
we ſhould <hi>not be tempted,</hi> but that we might not be <hi>led into the
Power, and Prevalency of Temptation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49412:227"/>
Thirdly, The <hi>Priviledges</hi> and Graces of the Children of God,
do ſtir up Satan's <hi>Pride,</hi> Revenge, and Rage againſt them. And
though he hath no encouragement to expect ſo <hi>eaſy</hi> a Conqueſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
theſe, as he hath over others, who are captivated by him at
pleaſure; Yet hath he encouragements to attempt them, for the
ſingular <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Advantage</hi> he makes of any <hi>ſucceſs</hi> againſt them;
the difficulty of the work being recompenced by the greatneſs of
the booty. For the fall of a Child of God (eſpecially of ſuch as
are noted above others) is as when <hi>a Standard-bearer fainteth;</hi> or
as the fall of an Oak that bears down with it the lower Shrubs
that ſtand near it. How the hearts of others <hi>fail</hi> for fear, leſt
they ſhould alſo be overcome. How the Hearts of ſome grow
thereby <hi>bold</hi> and ventureſome; How a general <hi>diſgrace</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
thereby doth accrue to Religion, and the ſincere Profeſſion
of it; are things of uſual Obſervation. If ſuch Men had not in
them ſomething of ſpecial <hi>Prey</hi> in caſe of Conqueſt, his Pride
would not ſo readily carry him againſt the heads and chief of the
People, while he ſeems to overlook the meaner, and weaker.
Out-Houſes, though more <hi>acceſſible,</hi> are not the Objects of the
Thief's Deſign; but the Dwelling-Houſe, though ſtronger
Built, and <hi>better Guarded</hi> (becauſe it affords hopes of richer Spoil)
is uſually aſſaulted. Neither do Pirates ſo much ſet themſelves
to take <hi>Empty Veſſels,</hi> though weakly Manned; but <hi>richly loaden</hi>
Ships (though better able to make reſiſtance) are the Ships of their
deſire.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Applic. 1.</note> This may be applyed for the <hi>Encouraging</hi> of thoſe that
think it <hi>ſtrange</hi> that Temptations do ſo haunt them; Eſpecially,
that they ſhould (in their apprehenſion) be <hi>more troubled</hi> by him,
when they <hi>fly furtheſt</hi> from him. The conſideration of this, will
much allay theſe thoughts, by theſe Inferences which it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, There is nothing <hi>unuſual</hi> befalls theſe Complainants.
Satan frequently doth ſo to others; they cannot juſtly ſay, their
caſe is <hi>Singular,</hi> or that they are alone in ſuch diſturbances; It is
but what is <hi>Common to Man.</hi> If they urge the <hi>unceſſantneſs</hi> of the
Devil's Attempts; Chriſt and others have felt the like. If they
object the peculiar <hi>Strangeneſs</hi> and <hi>Horridneſs</hi> of the Temptation:
(as moſt unſuitable to the ſtate of an upright Soul) Chriſt met
with the like. He was tempted to <hi>Self-deſtruction,</hi> to <hi>Diſtruſt,</hi> to
<hi>Blaſphemy</hi> it ſelf in the higheſt degree.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:49412:228"/>
Secondly, There is a good advantage to be made of them;
they are <hi>Preſervations</hi> from other Sins, that would otherwiſe grow
upon us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Theſe Temptations to the upright do but argue Satan's
<hi>loſs of Intereſt</hi> in them,<note place="margin">Tentationem experiuntur ac ſentiunt hi, qui ex animo Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ati Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> in loc.</note> and their greater <hi>Senſibility</hi> of the danger.
The captivated Sinners complain not ſo much; becauſe they are
ſo Inured to Temptation, that they mind not Satan's frequent
acceſſes. <hi>He that ſtudies Humility, is more ſenſible of a Temptation to
Pride, than he that is proud.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, This is alſo of uſe to thoſe that are apt to be <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
upon their Succeſſes againſt Sin through Grace. Satan (they
may ſee) will be upon them <hi>again;</hi> So that they muſt behave
themſelves as <hi>Mariners,</hi> who when they have got the Harbour,
and are out of the Storm, <hi>Mend</hi> their Ship, and Tackling, and
<hi>prepare</hi> again for the Sea.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If we conſider the unſpotted Holineſs of Chriſt, and
his conſtant Integrity under theſe Temptations, that they left
not the leaſt of <hi>Taint</hi> or ſinful <hi>Impreſſion</hi> upon him; we may
obſerve,</p>
                     <p>That there may be Temptations,<note place="margin">Obſ. 6.</note> without leaving a touch of Guilt or
Impurity behind them upon the Tempted.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, this is rare with Men, the beſt do ſeldom go down
to the <hi>Battel,</hi> but in their very Conqueſts they receive ſome <hi>wound.</hi>
And in thoſe Temptations that ariſe from our <hi>own</hi> hearts, we are
<hi>never</hi> without fault; but in ſuch as do ſolely ariſe from Satan, there
is a poſſibility, that the upright may ſo keep himſelf, that the <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one may not ſo touch him,</hi> as to leave the print of his Fingers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him.</p>
                     <p>But the great difficulty is,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> how it may be known when Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are from <hi>Satan,</hi> and when from <hi>our ſelves?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To Anſwer this,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I ſhall lay down theſe concluſions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The ſame Sins which <hi>our own natures</hi> would ſuggeſt to us,
may alſo be <hi>injected</hi> by <hi>Satan.</hi> Sometime <hi>we begin</hi> by the forward
working of our own thoughts upon <hi>occaſions</hi> and <hi>objects</hi> preſented
to us from <hi>without,</hi> or from the <hi>power</hi> of our own <hi>Inclination,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the offer of external Objects, and then Satan <hi>ſtrikes in</hi> with it;
ſometimes <hi>Satan begins</hi> with us, and by his injected motions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to <hi>excite</hi> our Inclinations; So that the <hi>ſame</hi> thing may be
ſometime from <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>from Satan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49412:228"/>
Secondly, There is no Sin ſo <hi>vile,</hi> but our <hi>own heart</hi> might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<hi>produce</hi> it without Satan, evil thoughts of the very worſt
kind,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 19.</note> as of <hi>Murthers, Adulteries, Thefts, Falſe Witneſs, and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,</hi>
may (as Chriſt ſpeaks) be produced <hi>naturally</hi> from our
own hearts; for ſeminally all Sins, the very greateſt of all Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are there: So that from the <hi>greatneſs</hi> and <hi>vileneſs</hi> of the
Temptation we cannot <hi>abſolutely</hi> conclude, that it is from Satan,
no more than from the <hi>commonneſs</hi> of the Temptation, or its <hi>ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs</hi>
to our Inclination, we can conclude <hi>infallibly</hi> that its <hi>firſt
riſe</hi> is from <hi>our ſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There are many caſes wherein it is very <hi>difficult,</hi> if not
altogether impoſſible to determine, whether our <hi>own heart,</hi> or
<hi>Satan</hi> gives the <hi>firſt</hi> life or breathing to a Temptation. Who can
determine in moſt <hi>ordinary</hi> caſes, when our thoughts are working
upon Objects preſented to our Senſes, whether Satan or our own
thoughts do run faſter? Yea when ſuch thoughts are not the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi>
of any <hi>former</hi> occaſion, it is a work too hard for moſt men to
determine which of the Parents, Father, or Mother, our <hi>own
Heart,</hi> or <hi>Satan,</hi> is <hi>firſt</hi> in the fault; they are both forward enough,
and uſually <hi>joyn</hi> hand in hand with ſuch <hi>readineſs,</hi> that he muſt
have a curious Eye that can diſcover certainly to whom the firſt
beginning is to be aſcribed.</p>
                     <p>The difficulty is ſo great, that ſome have judged it altogether
<hi>Impoſſible</hi> to give any <hi>certain</hi> marks by which it may be determined
when they are ours,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Capel.</hi> Tempt. Part 1. c. 4. §. 1.</note> and when Satans. And indeed the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
laid down by ſome are not ſufficient for a certain determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſo far I aſſent, that neither the <hi>ſuddenneſs</hi> of ſuch thoughts
(for the motions of our own Luſts may be ſudden) nor the <hi>horrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of the matter of them, are <hi>ſufficient</hi> notes of diſtinction. That
our own corrupt hearts may bring forth that which is unnatural
and terrible, cannot be denyed. Many of the Sins of the Heathens
mentioned in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. were the violent productions of Luſt againſt
natural Principles, and to aſcribe theſe to the Devil as to the firſt
Inſtigator, is more than any man hath warrant to do; Yet
though it be confeſſed that in <hi>ſome</hi> caſes it is impoſſible to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
and that where a diſtinction may be made, theſe notes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
are not <hi>fully</hi> ſatisfactory, ther may (I believe) be <hi>ſome</hi>
caſes wherein there is a poſſibility to <hi>diſcover</hi> when the motions
are from Satan, and that by the <hi>addition</hi> of ſome <hi>remarkable</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
to the forenamed marks of difference.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49412:229"/>
Fourthly,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Capel.</hi> Tempt. Part 1. c. 4.</note> Thought it be true (which ſome ſay) that (in moſt
caſes) it is <hi>needleſs</hi> altogether to ſpend our time in diſputing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the motions of Sin in our minds are firſtly from our ſelves or
from Satan, our <hi>greateſt</hi> buſineſs being rather to <hi>reſiſt</hi> them, than
to <hi>difference</hi> them; Yet there are <hi>ſpecial</hi> caſes, wherein it is very <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
to find out the <hi>true</hi> Parent of a ſinful Motion, and theſe are,
when tender Conſciences are wounded and oppreſſed with <hi>violent</hi>
and <hi>great</hi> Temptations, as <hi>Blaſpemous Thoughts, Atheiſtical Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
&amp;c. For here Satan in his furious moleſtations aims mainly
at this, that ſuch Afflicted and Toſſed Souls ſhould take all theſe
Thoughts which are <hi>obtruded</hi> upon their Imaginations, to be the
<hi>Iſſue</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> Heart. As <hi>Joſephs</hi> Steward hid the Cup in <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi>
Sack, that it might be a ground of accuſation againſt him: ſo
doth the Devil firſt <hi>oppreſs</hi> them with ſuch Thoughts, and then
<hi>accuſeth</hi> them of all that Villany and Wickedneſs, the Motions
whereof he had with ſuch Importunity forced upon them; and
ſo apt are the afflicted to <hi>comply</hi> with Accuſations againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that they <hi>believe</hi> it is ſo, and from thence conclude that
they are given up of God, hardned as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and finally that there is no hope of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for them. All this befalls them from their <hi>Ignorance</hi> of Satans
dealings; and here is their great need to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> Satans Malice
from their guilt.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Setting aſide <hi>ordinary</hi> Temptations, wherein it is neither
ſo <hi>poſſible,</hi> nor ſo <hi>material</hi> to buſy our ſelves to find out whether
they are Satan's or ours in <hi>extraordinary</hi> Temptations (ſuch as
have been now inſtanced); we may diſcover if they proceed from
Satan (though not ſimply from the <hi>matter</hi> of them, not from the

Actions that have no <hi>tendency</hi> that way, and yet we cannot ſo

<hi>actual loathing, ſtrenuous reluctancy,</hi> and <hi>high complainings</hi> of the
Soul, when the Mind is filled with <hi>horrour</hi> and the Body with
<hi>trembling</hi> at the preſence of ſuch Thoughts. Sins that owe their
firſt <hi>original</hi> to our ſelves, may indeed be <hi>reſiſted</hi> upon their <hi>firſt</hi> riſing
up in our Mind; and though a Sanctified Heart doth truly <hi>loath</hi>
them, yet are they not without ſome <hi>lower degree</hi> of tickling delight
upon the Affections for the Fleſh (in thoſe caſes) preſently <hi>riſeth</hi>
up with its <hi>luſtings</hi> for the ſinful Motion: but when ſuch unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Temptations are from Satan, their <hi>firſt</hi> appearance to the mind
is an horror without any <hi>ſenſible</hi> working of <hi>Inclination</hi> towards
them; and the greatneſs of the Soul's diſquiet doth ſhew, that it
hath met with that which the Affections look not on with any
amicable compliance.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Our Hearts may bring forth that which is <hi>unnatural</hi> in
it ſelf, and may give riſe to a Temptation that would be horrid to
the thoughts of other men, but that it ſhould of its own accord
(without a Tempter) on a <hi>ſudden</hi> bring forth that which is <hi>directly</hi>
contrary to its <hi>preſent Light, Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Inclination;</hi> As for a man
to be haunted with thoughts of Atheiſm, while he is under firm
perſwaſions that there is a God; or of Blaſphemy, while he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
deſigns of honouring him, is as unimaginable, as that our
thoughts ſhould of themſelves <hi>contrive</hi> our Death, while we are
moſt <hi>Solicitous</hi> for our Life; or that our thoughts ſhould ſoberly tell
us it is Night, when we ſee the Sun ſhine. <hi>Temptations that are
contrary to the preſent ſtate, poſture, light, and diſpoſition of the
Soul, are Satans.</hi> They are ſo unnatural, as to its preſent
frame, that the production of them muſt be from ſome other
agent.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Much more evident is it that ſuch proceed from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
when they are of <hi>long continuance</hi> and <hi>conſtant Trouble,</hi> when
they ſo inceſſantly beat upon the Mind, that it hath no reſt from
them, and yet is under greivous perplexities and anxieties of
mind about them.</p>

                     <p>I Am next to explain the <hi>Faſt</hi> of Chriſt, the End and Deſign
whereof (becauſe 'tis not expreſly mentioned) is variouſly
conjectured; Not to inſiſt in this Diſcourſe, which is deſigned
for Practice, on the Controverſy about the Quadrageſimal Faſt, that
which I ſhall firſt conſider,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Muſculus</hi> in loc.</note> is the Opinion of <hi>Muſculus,</hi> who (upon
this ground that his <hi>Faſt</hi> was not the <hi>Principal</hi> thing, for which
the Spirit <hi>led</hi> him into the Wilderneſs, for he was led not to <hi>Faſt,</hi>
but to be <hi>tempted,</hi> thereupon) concludes, that his was only a
<hi>conſequent</hi> of his Solitary condition in the Wilderneſs, and no other
thing than what befel <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who being engaged by
God to <hi>attend</hi> him in ſuch a Service where the <hi>ordinary</hi> means of
the Support of life were wanting, were therefore <hi>kept</hi> alive by
him in an <hi>Extraordinary</hi> way without them: thus he thinks the
Faſting was not (at leaſt principally) deſigned, but that he being
to undergo a Temptation in a deſolate Wilderneſs where he had
no Meat to Eat, there God reſtrained his hunger, ſo that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſired nor needed any. If we acquieſce in this, it will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
this Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49412:231"/>
That when God leads forth his Children to ſuch Services as ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
deprive them of the ordinary means of help or ſupply,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> There
God is engaged to give extraordinary Support, and his People may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it accordingly.</p>
                     <p>This is a great Truth in it ſelf, and a great and neceſſary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to all the Children of God that are called out to
Straits; But I ſhall not inſiſt on this as the Genuine product of
this Faſt.</p>
                     <p>If we look further amongſt <hi>Proteſtant Divines;</hi> we ſhall obſerve
it taken for granted, that Chriſt faſted upon Deſign, and this is
generally reduced to thoſe <hi>two</hi> heads.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, either for <hi>Inſtruction;</hi> as to ſhew that he was <hi>God,</hi> by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
ſo <hi>long,</hi> and that under the <hi>trouble</hi> of moleſting and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Temptations; whereas the Faſts of like date in <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Elias</hi>
were accompanied with the <hi>quiet</hi> repoſe of their thoughts: Or to
ſhew that he was <hi>Man,</hi> in that he really felt the <hi>natural</hi> infirmities
of the humane nature, in being <hi>hungry:</hi> Or to teach us the <hi>uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of Faſting in the general, when fit occaſions invite us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
Or,</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Light foct Harm.</hi> in loc.</note> For <hi>Confirmation</hi> of his Doctrine, to put an <hi>Honour</hi> and
Dignity upon his <hi>Employment;</hi> as <hi>Elias</hi> Faſted at the <hi>reſtoring</hi> of
Propheſy, and at the reformation; as <hi>Moſes</hi> Faſted at the <hi>Writing</hi>
of the Law: So Chriſt <hi>began</hi> the Goſpel of the Kingdom with <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</hi>
However that theſe things cannot be ſpoken againſt, being
Concluſions warrantably deduceable from this Act of Chriſts; yet
theſe ſeem not (in my apprehenſion) to come fully up to the
proper end of this undertaking of his; which ſeems not obſcurely
to be laid before us, in that Paſſage of <hi>Luke 4. 2. being forty days
tempted of the Devil, and in thoſe days he did eat nothing:</hi> where we
ſee that his being <hi>tempted forty days</hi> was the <hi>principal</hi> thing, and
that his <hi>Faſting</hi> had a plain <hi>reference</hi> and reſpect to his Temptation,
Thus far (I ſuppoſe) we may be ſecure, that we have the deſign
in the general, that his Faſting was in <hi>order</hi> to his Temptation.
But then whether this was deſigned as an <hi>occaſion</hi> of the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or as a <hi>remedy</hi> againſt them, 'tis not ſo eaſy to determine.
That one of thoſe (at leaſt) was intended, cannot be denyed by
thoſe that will grant that his Faſt related to the Combat; and it
ſeems not to labour of any <hi>repugnancy</hi> or abſurdity, if we ſay that
tis poſſible that <hi>both</hi> theſe ends might be aimed at, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49412:231"/>
I ſhall proceed to obſerve upon them. There are only ſome
other things to be firſt diſpatched out of the way: As</p>
                     <p>The <hi>continuance</hi> of the Faſt, why it was forty days, neither <hi>more</hi>
nor <hi>leſs.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Spanhem</hi> dub. Evan. in loc.</note> Though ſome adventure to give reaſons for it, not only
<hi>Papiſts</hi> (who according to their wont, are ridiculous and trifling
in this matter) but alſo <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſuppoſing that ſome regard
(was or ought to be) had to his <hi>fulfilling</hi> the times of the <hi>Faſts</hi> of
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> Yet I think 'tis neither pertinent nor ſafe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
any thing about it, only it obſerves to us that the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of this was a conſiderable time.</p>
                     <p>We are more concerned to enquire whether Chriſt was under
any <hi>conflict</hi> of Temptation <hi>all that time:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Spanhem</hi> in loc.</note> which though ſome deny,
leſt they ſhould favour a ſeeming contradiction among the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 4. 2.</note> yet the words of <hi>Luke</hi> are ſo expreſs, <hi>[being forty days
tempted of the Devil]</hi> that no tollerable Evaſion can be found to
caſt theſe Temptations to the end of the forty days; for he tells us,
he was not only tempted <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Expiration</hi> of the forty days, but
that he was tempted <hi>during</hi> the continuance of the forty days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide;
only there was a difference in the <hi>Kinds</hi> of theſe Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in regard of the <hi>way</hi> wherein Satan managed them, and this
alſo is fully ſet down by <hi>Matth. [And when the Tempter came to him,]</hi>
which with the other Expreſſion of <hi>Luke</hi> compared, ſhews us,
that <hi>during</hi> the ſpace of the forty days Satan <hi>tempted</hi> Chriſt, and
yet <hi>came not to him</hi> till <hi>afterward,</hi> that is, he managed thoſe Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in an Inviſible way. Hence we may note,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Satan doth uſually tempt in an Inviſible way and manner.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note>
To Explain this a little, I ſhall Evidence it by a few Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That he hath a hand in all Sins firſt or laſt, and then it
muſt needs be in an <hi>Inviſible</hi> way, his work is to tempt, to go
about, laying Snares to draw men to Sin. <hi>Wicked Men are of their
Father the Devil,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 44.</note> and do his Works. Carnal deſires are <hi>his Luſts;</hi>
giving way to Anger,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 26, 27.</note> is <hi>giving place to the Devil,</hi> and reſiſting of
Sin is called in the General,<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>a reſiſting of the Devil; &amp;c.</hi> In all this
work of Satan, men do not <hi>ſee</hi> him; when he <hi>puts</hi> evil Motions
into their Hearts they do not <hi>perceive</hi> him, and therefore doth he
his work in an Inviſible way.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We have ſufficient diſcoveries of theſe <hi>private</hi> Paths
of his: for (1.) Some time he tempts by <hi>friends,</hi> he tempted
<hi>Job</hi> by his Wife, <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>Peter.</hi> (2.) Sometime by <hi>External Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49412:232"/>
as he drew out <hi>Achans</hi> Covetouſneſs, and <hi>Davids</hi> unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
by the Eye. (3.) Sometime by <hi>Injecting</hi> Thoughts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to our Mind. (4.) Sometime by exerciſing an <hi>Inviſible Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
upon our Bodies, in ſtirring up the humors thereof, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
to Paſſion or Exceſſive Mirth. All theſe ways (of which I
have diſcourſed before more largely) are Secret and Inviſible, and
by ſuch as theſe he moſt uſually tempts.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Wiles, Depths, Secrets and Devices of Satan,
which the Scripture tells us are his moſt familiar Ways and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
they in their own nature Imply a ſtudyed or deſigned <hi>ſecrecy</hi>
and <hi>Imperceptibility.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He hath peculiar <hi>Reaſons</hi> of Policy for his Inviſible
way of dealing; for the <hi>leſs viſible</hi> he is, the <hi>leſs Suſpicious</hi> are his
Deſigns, and conſequently the <hi>leſs frightful,</hi> and more taking. By
this way he inſinuates himſelf ſo into our Boſoms, that he gets a
<hi>party in us</hi> againſt our ſelves, <hi>before</hi> we are aware; whereas in vain
(he knows) he ſhould ſpread his <hi>Net,</hi> if his Deſigns and Enmity
were <hi>diſcovered</hi> to us.</p>
                     <p>This muſt teach us to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> Satan where we ſee him not,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> and
ſo to converſe with Objects and Occaſions as ſtill fearing that there
may be <hi>Anguis in herba,</hi> a ſecret Snare laid for us to intrap us at
unawares.</p>
                     <p>If we again caſt our Eyes upon what hath been ſaid, that
Chriſt was tempted <hi>all the Forty days,</hi> It will then give us this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                     <p>That Satan is ſometime Inceſſant in Temptations,<note place="margin">Obſ. 3.</note> and ſets upon us
with continued Importunities.</p>
                     <p>Here we may note a diſtinction of Temptations (beſides that
of Inviſible and Viſible, of which I have ſpoken) that ſome are
<hi>movable</hi> and <hi>ſhort ſits,</hi> and as it were <hi>skirmiſhes,</hi> in which he ſtays
not long, and others are more <hi>fixed</hi> and durable, we may call them
<hi>Solemn</hi> Temptations, in which Satan doth as it were <hi>pitch</hi> down
his Tents, and doth manage a long <hi>Siege</hi> againſt us. Of theſe laſt
ſort is this Obſervation.</p>
                     <p>Thus he tempted <hi>Paul,</hi> continuing his Aſſault for ſome time
before he departed.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 8.</note> Thus alſo he dealt with <hi>Joſeph</hi> who was ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
day by day for a long time together.<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 10.</note> Of theſe I ſhall note a
few things. As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Such Temptations are not without a <hi>ſpecial Commiſſion.</hi> He
cannot indeed tempt at all without leave, but in the ordinary
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49412:232"/>
courſe of his Temptations he hath a <hi>general</hi> Commiſſion under ſuch
<hi>reſtraints</hi> and limitations as pleaſeth the moſt High to put upon
him, but in theſe he muſt have a <hi>Special</hi> Order, as we ſee in <hi>Job's</hi>
Caſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Such Temptations have alſo a <hi>Special Ground.</hi> Either
the preſent <hi>State</hi> and Poſture of our Condition is ſuch as Satan
apprehends highly <hi>advantagious</hi> for his deſign, and therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to have the <hi>winnowing</hi> of us at <hi>ſuch</hi> a Seaſon; or there are
more than <hi>ordinary Diſpoſitions</hi> and Inclinations in our heart to what
we are directly tempted to, or to <hi>ſome other</hi> conſequent deſign:
theſe animate and encourage him to high reſolves of proſecuting
us more cloſely, upon an expectation that a continued Sollicitation
is moſt likely to prevail at the long run.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is poſſible that ſuch Temptations may <hi>ſtand</hi> out
againſt the Endeavours of <hi>many</hi> Prayers, and that we ſhall find
they are not ſo eaſily ſhaken off as the <hi>Viper</hi> that was upon <hi>Pauls</hi>
hand. <hi>Paul (2 Cor. 12. 8.)</hi> prayed <hi>thrice</hi> againſt the Meſſenger of
Satan, that is, (as <hi>Eſtius</hi> and others interpret) he Prayed <hi>often</hi>
and fervently, and yet it departed not.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Such Temptations give <hi>no reſt</hi> nor intermiſſion, men
are haunted and dogged by them, what way ſoever they go,
they ſtill hear the ſame things, and cannot command their
thoughts to give an excluſion to his Motions, but ſtill by <hi>renewed</hi>
diſputes and arguings, or by <hi>clamorous</hi> Importunities, they are vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and tormented: which ſurely ſhews an high degree of earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Impudency in Satan.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Theſe are conſequently very <hi>burdenſome,</hi> exceeding
Irkſome and Tireſome to us. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them <hi>Buffetings,</hi> for their
trouble and moleſtation. Satan ſo moleſted <hi>Job</hi> in his Affliction
by inward accuſations and troubles of terror, that as an <hi>overwearied</hi>
man he cries out he had no quiet, and that he was diſappointed of
his hope of eaſe, in ſleep, becauſe he was then <hi>ſcared with dreams
and terrified with Viſions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Theſe are alſo upon a ſpecial deſign <hi>on God's part,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>find us work,</hi> and to keep us doing, or to <hi>prevent</hi> Sin and
Miſcarriage; to <hi>keep</hi> down our pride, leſt we ſhould be <hi>exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
meaſure;</hi> to <hi>awaken</hi> us from Slothfulneſs and Security, leſt
we ſhould <hi>ſettle upon our Lees;</hi> or to be an <hi>occaſion</hi> of his <hi>Grace,</hi> and
an <hi>Evidence</hi> of his <hi>Power</hi> in our preſervation, ſatisfying us and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that in the greateſt Shocks of our Spiritual Battel, his <hi>Grace
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49412:233"/>
is ſufficient for us.</hi> Upon theſe, and ſuch like deſigns as theſe,
doth the moſt wiſe God permit it.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Satan doth not attempt Temptations of this kind
but upon a <hi>ſpecial deſign,</hi> and that either becauſe he hopes by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and <hi>pertinacious Impetuoſity</hi> at length to prevail, or that he
would <hi>pleaſe</hi> himſelf to moleſt us; for ſurely the crys and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Gods Children are Muſick in his Ears; or at leaſt, upon
a deſign to <hi>diſcourage</hi> us in our Services, and to make way for
<hi>other</hi> Temptations of <hi>Murmuring, Blaſphemy, Deſpair,</hi> &amp;c. Which
are as a Reſerve or Ambuſhment laid in wait for us. The Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from hence are theſe two.</p>
                     <p>That the Children of God under ſuch Temptations may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
under a <hi>patient expectation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Applic. 1.</note> by conſidering that Chriſt did
undergo the <hi>like Aſſaults</hi> from Satan: 'tis in it ſelf tedious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartning,
but they may ſee,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That this way of trouble is <hi>uſual,</hi> and that to the <hi>beſt,</hi> and
therefore they ſhould not faint under it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That Grace is <hi>ſufficient</hi> to preſerve from the <hi>prevalency</hi>
of the moſt earneſt Temptations, even there, where our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father thinks it not fit to <hi>preſerve</hi> us from the <hi>trouble</hi> of them.
When <hi>Paul</hi> gives the higheſt Security that the Faithfulneſs of God
can afford,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> that Temptations ſhall not be above <hi>Strength,</hi> or the
Ability that ſhall be given them; he tells them they are not to
expect always ſuch aids as ſhall preſently <hi>drive away</hi> the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that it muſt immediately <hi>Vaniſh;</hi> or that their Temptations
ſhall become <hi>light and contemptible,</hi> but that Gods Faithfulneſs
will be no further engaged in the General, than (1.) to make
their Temptations tolerable, that <hi>they may be able to bear them</hi>
though not without much to do. (2.) That the <hi>way of Eſcape</hi> ſhall
be <hi>concurrent</hi> with the <hi>continuance</hi> of the Temptation, that though
the Temptation abide, yet we ſhall be aided under it. (3.) That
yet he is as careful of our help in Temptations, as he is ready to
commiſſionate them, when need requires, his reſolves that we ſhould
be tempted, and his reſolves that we ſhould be ſuccoured, they
bear the ſame date. <hi>With the Temptation he will make a way to eſcape.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That ſuch Temptations do not argue (1.) Either a
<hi>likelyhood</hi> much leſs a <hi>neceſſity</hi> that they ſhould prevail; nor (2.) any
<hi>want</hi> of care and love in God; nor (3.) do they <hi>always</hi> evidence
a <hi>more than ordinary</hi> proneneſs and Inclination in us; for Chriſt (who
was moſt averſe to the leaſt of Sin, who was higheſt in God's love,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49412:233"/>
againſt whom there was no poſſibility he ſhould prevail, yet) was
thus tempted.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Applic. 2.</note> In ſuch continued Violences, it will concern us to
make <hi>Stout</hi> Reſiſtances, acording to the Counſel of <hi>Jam. 4. 7. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the Devil, and he will fly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But I have done ſo,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and yet the Temptation is the
ſame, and ſtill continues?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> 'Tis not enough to <hi>reſiſt,</hi> but we muſt <hi>continue</hi> to
do ſo. Some make <hi>limited</hi> reſiſtances, as beſieged Perſons, that
ſet a time for their holding out, and then if they be not relieved at
that time, they yield; but we muſt reſolve a <hi>perpetual reſiſtance,</hi> as
long as the Temptation <hi>laſts;</hi> when one hand is beaten off, we
muſt hold by another; when both are beaten of, we muſt (as it
were) hold by our Teeth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In a faithful reſiſtance, we may <hi>caſt</hi> the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>upon God,</hi> and engage him in the Quarrel, as <hi>David; I will ſay
unto God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But how is it conſiſtent with Truth that the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould continue,<note place="margin">Object.</note> when <hi>James</hi> tells us, that Satan <hi>will fly</hi> upon
<hi>Reſiſtance?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> It may be, the Reſiſtance is not as it ought, and ſo
the blame is ours; If we be not <hi>ſerious,</hi> (as ſome who defie the
Devil in words, and reſiſt him by croſſing themſelves, things
which doubtleſs the Devil laughs at) or if in the <hi>Confidence</hi> of a
preſumptuous <hi>Bravado,</hi> or if not with that <hi>Humility</hi> and Care that
is requiſite, It will be no wonder if he depart not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He doth <hi>fly</hi> at every reſiſtance <hi>more or leſs,</hi> he doth
give back, and is diſcouraged, and is a loſer by every Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Though the Scripture ſay that he ſhall flie, (that is,
ſooner or later) yet it doth not ſay, that he ſhall do ſo <hi>Immediately</hi>
(though moſt uſually he doth ſo, where he is peremptorily rejected)
but in ſome Caſes time muſt be allowed, for the Devil (as it is in
<hi>Chryſoſtom's</hi> Compariſon) ſtands like a <hi>Fawning Dog</hi> ſcratching
and waving his Tail, and if any thing be given him, it makes
him importunate for more; yet though we give him nothing,
we cannot expect that the firſt or ſecond denial ſhould make him
ceaſe his trouble; as he hath been encouraged by <hi>former Complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
ſo will he not be diſcouraged, but with <hi>many</hi> and <hi>continued</hi>
denials.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49412:234"/>
If we conſider the <hi>Faſt</hi> of Chriſt, as an <hi>occaſion</hi> deſigned by God
for an <hi>advantage</hi> to the Temptation, and then look upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in the Wilderneſs being under <hi>hazards</hi> from wild Beaſts, in
<hi>want</hi> of neceſſaries, and without a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of ſupplies in an uſual
way, and alſo under the <hi>diſcomforts</hi> of Cold and long Nights (for
according to the conjectures of ſome this was about our <hi>October</hi>
and <hi>November)</hi> Then we may obſerve,<note place="margin">Light foot Harm. <hi>in loc.</hi>

                        <hi>That 'tis Satans way,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>to ſecond outward Diſtreſſes and Afflictions
with inward Temptations.</hi> We ſee the like carriage of Satan, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Job.</hi> His Affliction was followed with many Temptations,
all his Friends, in urging him with Hypocriſy, were no other
than parties to Satans Deſign, though they knew it not appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently;
his Wife is ſet on by the Tempter, (as the Serpent againſt
Eve) to provoke him to <hi>curſe God and die.</hi> Beſides all this, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall conſider, what <hi>inward workings</hi> of Heart, <hi>Spiritual</hi>
trouble and conflict, his words frequently expreſs: they will
quickly find, that when God put <hi>Job</hi> into Satans hand, under
that only limitation of not touching <hi>his Life,</hi> he gave Satan a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to purſue him with <hi>inward</hi> Temptations, as well as <hi>outward</hi>
Vexations. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was pinched with the ſtraits of the
Wilderneſs, Satan was moſt buſy with them, to put them upon
Diſtruſt, Murmuring, Revolt, diſobedient Oppoſitions, Idolatry,
and what not? <hi>David</hi> gives in his experience to confirm this
Truth, he never met with <hi>outward</hi> Troubles, but he had alſo <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
Temptations with them, as <hi>Fretting, Diſquiet, ſad Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Gods Wrath, Haſt, Diſtruſt, Fear,</hi> &amp;c. As the relation of
his ſeveral ſtraits do teſtify. And beſides theſe, the generality of
God's Children find it ſo, outward Afflictions ſeldom paſs alone;
when they have <hi>frightings without,</hi> they have <hi>fears within</hi> uſually;
ſeldom have they a Sickneſs, or meet with a ſad Providence, but
they have Satan buſy with their Souls, moleſting their Peace, or
endeavouring to enſnare them. Thus their Feet are never in the
<hi>Stocks,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 8. 13.</note> but the <hi>Iron</hi> enters into their <hi>Soul.</hi> And for this reaſon is
it,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 6.</note> that outward Afflictions and Troubles are called <hi>Temptations</hi>
in Scripture,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 9.</note> becauſe <hi>Temptations</hi> uſually <hi>accompany</hi> them, and they
are indeed the <hi>Solemn Seaſons,</hi> that Satan deſires to improve for
that end; and for that is it that <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſeth that which we
tranſlate, <hi>a time of Temptation,</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
an occaſion or opportunity of Temptation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49412:234"/>
The Temptations that Satan drives on, upon the advantage of
an Afflicted Eſtate; are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To drive men upon <hi>Impatient outbreakings</hi> againſt God, as
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, turn upon <hi>Moſes</hi> with this, <hi>Haſt
thou brought us into the Wilderneſs to ſlay us?</hi> To this tended <hi>Job's</hi>
Temptation by his Wife, <hi>Curſe God and die,</hi> as 'tis in our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which cannot in any wiſe admit of the excuſe, that <hi>Beza</hi>
makes for her, as if ſhe gave wholſome advice, <hi>to die, bleſſing of
God;</hi> becauſe he <hi>reproves</hi> her ſharply, as having ſpoken <hi>fooliſhly</hi> and
wickedly; but at beſt, 'tis an Ironical Scoff at <hi>Jobs</hi> Integrity, <hi>Doſt</hi>
thou <hi>bleſs</hi> God while thou art <hi>killed</hi> by his diſpleaſure? if it be not
a <hi>direct</hi> ſuggeſtion of revengeful deſpite. At ſuch times Men are
too apt to entertain cruel thoughts of God, and ſadly reflective
upon his Mercy or Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In this poſture of Affliction he ſtrives to put them
upon <hi>direful concluſious</hi> againſt themſelves, as if God <hi>called ſolemnly</hi>
their <hi>Sin</hi> to remembrance, and that they are <hi>forſaken</hi> of God, and
<hi>marked</hi> out for deſtruction; the pledg and earneſt whereof, they
take theſe troubles to be. We way obſerve that <hi>David's</hi> Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
awakened his Conſcience, to object guilt and miſcarriage, ſo
that he is as earneſt to deprecate the marking and remembrance of
his Sin, as he is to pray againſt his troubles. For this ſee
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 6, 7.<note place="margin">Pſal. 38. 1, 4.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He puſheth them uſually upon <hi>contempt of Religion,</hi>
and abandoning the ways of God: We are too apt to blame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
for all our Troubles; and as we expect that our owning the
ways of God ſhould ſecure us from outward Affliction, ſo when
we find it otherwiſe, we are too forward to ſay, <hi>we have waſhed our
hands in vain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Sin of <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> is another evil that he drives at; he
would have Men conclude that God <hi>cannot,</hi> or <hi>will not</hi> deliver. <hi>Can
God prepare a Table in the Wilderneſs?</hi> ſaid the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by the
power of Temptation, when they were diſtreſſed.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lectere ſi ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queo Superos, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> Another Evil aimed at in ſuch a caſe, is, to put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>indirect Courſes</hi> and ways to eſcape from our Troubles. <hi>Saul</hi>
went to the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> when God anſwered him not. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
naturally prompt ſuch things, and a little Temptation
makes us comply, as is noted by the wiſe Mens deſire, Give me not
poverty, leſt I put out my Hand and Steal; Diſtreſſes of Poverty
put men upon Theft and unlawful ways.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:49412:235"/>
The Reaſons of Satans tempting the Afflicted are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That outward Afflictions are a <hi>load</hi> and burthen; this
gives a probability, that his deſigns may the better take place.
'Tis eaſy to <hi>overthrow</hi> thoſe that are <hi>bowed down,</hi> to <hi>break</hi> thoſe
that are <hi>bruiſed,</hi> to <hi>maſter</hi> thoſe that are <hi>weary</hi> and <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, An Afflicted Eſtate is a Temptation <hi>of it ſelf,</hi> and
naturally dictates evil things: It is half of his deſign brought
to his hand, it affords variety of matter for a Temptation to work
on.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Such a Condition ſtrongly <hi>backs</hi> a Temptation, and
furniſheth many Arguments for a prevalency; for Troubles are
<hi>ſerious</hi> things, they ſpeak to the Heart, and what they ſpeak, they
ſpeak <hi>fiercely;</hi> they repreſent things <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> than <hi>common</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
can do, and for the moſt part, they ſhew an Ingenuity in
<hi>multiplying</hi> Fears, and <hi>aggravating</hi> Hazard, and <hi>aſcertaining</hi> ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Events, ſo that Satan can ſcarce deſire a fairer Hit, than
what theſe offer him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They alſo give him the advantage of <hi>darkneſs;</hi> for to
ſuch, their <hi>way is hid,</hi> and God hath hedged them in, they neither
know <hi>where they are;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 3. 23.</note> whether their trouble by a <hi>chaſtiſement</hi> of
Sin, or for <hi>Tryal,</hi> or for <hi>prevention</hi> of miſcarriage, or to <hi>make way</hi>
for more comfortable manifeſtations; and as little know they <hi>how
to behave themſelves</hi> in their Trouble; or <hi>how</hi> and <hi>when</hi> to get out
of it. In ſuch groping uncertainties, 'tis ſcarce poſſible, but they
ſhould be put wrong.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, An Afflicted condition brings on <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi>
to duty, it makes the hands weak, and the Knees feeble;
This made <hi>Job</hi> to faint,<note place="margin">Job 4. 5.</note> this dryed up <hi>Davids</hi> Strength. The firſt
Aſſault of an Affliction doth ſtound the Soul, and put it into ſuch
a confuſion, that <hi>hope</hi> turns back, and <hi>Faith</hi> is to ſeek, and every
<hi>Grace</hi> ſo out of order, that a man ſhall be unable to do any thing
of duty, in a comfortable manner.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, In this caſe Men are apt to conclude their <hi>Prayers are
not heard: I cry in the day time and thou heareſt not,</hi> ſays <hi>David.
Hath the Lord forgotten to be Gracious?</hi> And with ſuch ſeeming
probability is this urged upon us by Affliction, that <hi>Job</hi> profeſſeth,
he could not believe his own Sence and Knowledg in ſuch a caſe.
<hi>If I had called,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 9. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>and he had anſwered me, yet would I not believe that
he had hearkened unto my Voice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49412:235"/>
Seventhly, Afflictions ſtrongly <hi>fix</hi> Guilt upon us, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
God <hi>Searching out our Iniquities,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 10. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>and Enquiring after our
Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eightly, They <hi>Imbitter</hi> the Spirit, and beget Impreſſions upon
the mind, of very hard thoughts of God.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, They violently puſh Men on to ſpeak <hi>unadviſedly:</hi>
there is ſuch a ſwelling <hi>Ferment</hi> of the old <hi>leaven</hi> of Impatience
and Diſtruſt in the Mind, that 'tis matter of pain and difficulty to
be ſilent,<note place="margin">Job 32. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>their belly is as Wine that hath no vent; It is ready to burſt like
New Bottles;</hi> and they are <hi>weary with forbearing,</hi> and <hi>cannot ſtay,</hi> and
muſt ſpeak <hi>let come on them what will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All theſe advantages doth an Afflicted Condition bring to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;
and who can think that he who is ſo Studious of our ruine,
will be willing to miſs ſo fair an opportunity?</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Applic. 1.</note> This muſt teach us to have a <hi>watchful</hi> Eye over <hi>Affliction,</hi>
though at all times we muſt expect Satans Stratagems, yet in
Troubles eſpecially prepare for them; according to the wiſe Mans
advice, <hi>in a day of adverſity, conſider.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Seeing Satan takes advantage of the <hi>ſharp humours</hi>
of Impatience and Diſtruſt, we muſt be particularly careful, not
to touch too much upon the <hi>harſhneſs</hi> of our Troubles, becauſe this
is that that ſets fretting and diſtracting thoughts on work. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
(like the Pillar of the Cloud and Fire in the Wilderneſs)
have a <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and accordingly theſe that converſe
with the <hi>dark ſide</hi> of Troubles, <hi>Invenome</hi> their Imaginations, and
<hi>Poyſon</hi> their Thoughts with <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>hideous concluſions,</hi> and in a
word, draw forth nothing but the <hi>Wormwood</hi> and the <hi>Gall;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
thoſe that Study and view the <hi>light ſide</hi> of them, are full of <hi>praiſe</hi>
and <hi>admiration,</hi> for the gracious <hi>mixtures,</hi> comfortable <hi>mitigations,</hi>
encouraging <hi>Supports,</hi> &amp;c. which they obſerve. 'Tis Wiſdom
then to keep upon the right ſide of them.</p>
                     <p>Though it be the deſign of God to turn the <hi>dark ſide</hi> of the Cloud
to us; Yet may we have a <hi>competent Light</hi> to guide us, if we would
<hi>improve</hi> it; when the <hi>Sun</hi> is ſet, the <hi>Moon</hi> may be up. Nay 'tis
our duty to ſtrive to <hi>recover</hi> the right ſide of the Cloud; He <hi>hides</hi>
that we may <hi>ſeek.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this <hi>Faſt</hi> of Chriſts be conſider'd as a <hi>remedy</hi> againſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
then may we obſerve; <hi>That Solemn Temptations are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted

of what is hiſtorically related; If we take ſuch a Liberty, we may

Secondly, The <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of the Temptation are ſo <hi>particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
ſet down; as the Devils <hi>coming</hi> to him, <hi>leaving</hi> him, <hi>taking</hi> him
to the Temple,<note place="margin">

our ſelves from a viſionary Suppoſition, we may do it in this
Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This Imagination doth wholly <hi>enervate</hi> and make void
the very end and <hi>deſign</hi> of Chriſts being <hi>tempted:</hi> for where were the
Glory of this <hi>Victory</hi> over Satan, if it were only a viſionary Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a viſionary Conqueſt? or where were the <hi>comfort</hi> and
encouragement which Believers (from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Authority, <hi>Heb.
2.</hi> 18. &amp; 4. 16.) might reap from this, that Chriſt imagined himſelf
to be tempted, when really he was not ſo? Nay how impoſſible
is it, to make that expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>[he was tempted in all
points like as we are,]</hi> to agree to an imaginary Temptation? ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we alſo ſay, that we are only tempted <hi>viſionarily</hi> and not
<hi>really?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Neither is it a plea of any value againſt this Truth,
that it ſeems to <hi>derogate</hi> too much from the <hi>Honour</hi> and Authority
of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Non mirum eſt Chriſtum pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſiſſe ſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumduci a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolo, qui per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſit ſe a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris ſuis Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifigi.</note> that Satan ſhould ſo impudently <hi>aſſault</hi> him, with

hand, in which I ſhall firſt pitch upon the general <hi>proaemium,</hi> or
Introduction to theſe ſpecial Temptations, which is this, <hi>The
Tempter came to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this we are to take notice of the <hi>Name</hi> given to Satan, and
alſo the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of the <hi>Aſſault,</hi> in that Expreſſion, he

                     </p>
                     <p>There are <hi>three</hi> diſtinct Names given to him in theſe Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
(1.) His Name <hi>Satan,</hi> ſhews his <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Fury,</hi> which
is the Ground and Fountain whence all that Trouble proceeds,
which we meet with from him. (2.) He is ſtiled the <hi>Temper,</hi> and

that ſignifies to us, how he <hi>puts forth</hi> this Malice, his Way and

we and others may be true and <hi>proper</hi> Tempters, yet this hindereth
not but that it is moſt true, that Satan makes Temptation his very
<hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Buſineſs.</hi> And therefore not only here, but in 1 <hi>Theſ. 3.
5.</hi> The Devil is deſcribed by his <hi>Imployment; Leſt by any means the

This Name then is put upon Satan <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> by way of <hi>Eminency.</hi>
Implying (1.) That though there be never ſo many Tempters, yet
Satan is the <hi>chief.</hi> (2.) That he makes Temptation his <hi>proper</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
                     <p>That Satan doth ſo, I ſhall evidence by theſe few Notes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Temptation is in it ſelf a <hi>Buſineſs</hi> and <hi>Work.</hi> For if we
conſider either the <hi>Work</hi> of any one Temptation (where Satan is
oft put to it, after <hi>Suggeſtion</hi> to <hi>perſwade,</hi> and after <hi>perſwaſion</hi> to
<hi>inſtigate</hi> and provoke;) or if we conſider what <hi>Furniture,</hi> Tools,
Means, and Inſtruments are requiſite, and what it may <hi>coſt</hi> to
bring all things together into <hi>fit order</hi> and <hi>method;</hi> or if we think
of the <hi>various</hi> ways and manners of temptation; That ſome are
<hi>mediate,</hi> ſome <hi>immediate;</hi> ſome <hi>inward,</hi> ſome <hi>outward;</hi> ſome <hi>move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
ſome <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>ſolemn;</hi> ſome <hi>inticements</hi> to <hi>Evil,</hi> ſome <hi>affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
from <hi>Duty,</hi> others <hi>invaſions</hi> of our peace and joy; or laſtly, if
we call to mind, what <hi>Study,</hi> what <hi>Art,</hi> what <hi>fetches</hi> and <hi>contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanees</hi>
the Devil is ſometimes put upon, we ſhall eaſily ſee, that
it keeps him doing, and that <hi>he eats not the bread of Idleneſs</hi> that
hath that Imployment to follow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:49412:237"/>
Secondly, Satan <hi>gives up himſelf</hi> unto it, is wholly in it,
<hi>he walks to and fro,</hi> goes <hi>about</hi> ſeeking advantages of this nature,
<hi>compaſſeth Sea and Land to Proſelite men</hi> to his Slavery, uſeth all
<hi>means,</hi> upon all <hi>men,</hi> at all <hi>times,</hi> with all <hi>diligence;</hi> Hence was it,
that <hi>Latimer</hi> (in his homely way of ſpeaking) called him, a <hi>buſy
Biſhop in his Dioceſs,</hi> and excited the ſluggiſh to learn laboriouſneſs
of the Devil.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He takes a <hi>delight</hi> in it, not only from a <hi>natural propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi>
which his fall put upon him, whereby he cannot but tempt,
as an evil Tree cannot but bring forth evil Fruits: But alſo from
the power of an <hi>habit acquired</hi> by long exerciſe, which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with ſome kind of pleaſure; and further, whatever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
may be ſuppoſed to ariſe from <hi>revengeful</hi> Pride or <hi>companion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
in evil,<note place="margin">Solamen miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> he hath of that in full meaſure, preſſed down, and
running over.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, All other things in Satan, or in his indeavours, have
either a <hi>ſubſerviency,</hi> or ſome way or other a <hi>reference</hi> and reſpect to
Temptation. His <hi>Power, Wiſdom, Malice,</hi> and other infernal
<hi>Qualifications,</hi> render him <hi>able</hi> to tempt; his <hi>Labour</hi> and Diligence
in <hi>other</hi> things are but the work of one that <hi>prepares</hi> Materials and
Occaſions; his other buſineſs of <hi>accuſing, afrighting, deſtroying, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,</hi>
are but the ends and improvements of tempting.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, He cares not <hi>how</hi> it goes on, ſo that it <hi>go on;</hi> as a Man
that deſigns to be rich, cares not how he gets it; which ſhews, that
tempting in general is his deſign. Of this we have many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
as (1.) he ſtick not to <hi>lie</hi> and diſſemble, he will tell
them of the <hi>Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of them,</hi> and a
thouſand fair promiſes which he never intends. (2.) He will
tempt for a <hi>ſmall matter,</hi> if he can but gain a little, or but moleſt
us, yet he will be doing. (3.) He will not give over for a <hi>foil</hi> or
diſappointment. (4.) He is not aſhamed to tempt <hi>contradictory</hi>
things, he tempted Chriſt <hi>againſt</hi> the work of Redemption, <hi>Maſter
ſpare thy ſelf.</hi> He tempted <hi>Judas</hi> to <hi>further</hi> it in betraying him.
(5.) Any Temptation that he ſees will <hi>hold,</hi> he takes up with;
hence is it that he tempts not the <hi>Jews now</hi> to Idolatry, becauſe
he hath them faſt in another <hi>ſnare,</hi> being ſtrongly led to an <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi>
and contempt of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> (6.) He will ſometime tempt
where he hath not <hi>probability</hi> to prevail, even againſt hope. Thus
he tempted <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:49412:238"/>
The uſe of the Obſervation is this:<note place="margin">Applic.</note> If it be his <hi>buſineſs</hi> to tempt,
it muſt be our work to <hi>reſiſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, To reſiſt is a <hi>labour,</hi> 'tis not an idle formality, conſiſting
in words of defyance, or a few ridiculous <hi>Croſſings,</hi> and ſprinklings
of <hi>Holy Water,</hi> or <hi>ſpitting</hi> at the name of him, as Ignorant People
are wont to do.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We muſt <hi>give up</hi> our ſelves to this work, always
fighting and oppoſing.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It will be neceſſary to make uſe of all <hi>helps,</hi> as
Prayer, Faſting, the Counſel and Support of Holy and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
Men.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, We muſt alſo caſt off all <hi>hinderances,</hi> whatſoever in
us is apt to take fire, or give advantage, muſt be laid off; as <hi>Pride</hi>
(which doth prognoſticate a fall) and <hi>Security,</hi> which betrays the
beſt; or <hi>Preſumption,</hi> which provokes God to leave thoſe of higheſt
attainments.<note place="margin">Neh 13. 16.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, In this general <hi>Introduction,</hi> we may caſt our Eye,
upon the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of the Aſſault; when 'tis ſaid, the <hi>Tempter
came unto him,</hi> we are unavoidably forced to ſuppoſe, <hi>another</hi>
manner of coming, than that whereby he tempted him for <hi>forty
days</hi> together. And when we call to mind, that at his coming
here mentioned, he <hi>carried</hi> Chriſt to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and from thence
to a high <hi>Mountain,</hi> and there propounded himſelf an Object of
<hi>Worſhip;</hi> we can imagine no leſs, than that Satan here came <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly</hi>
to him; but in what ſhape or manner of Appearance, it is
altogether uncertain, though 'tis moſt probable, it was not in the
form of a <hi>Brute,</hi> but in ſome luſtre of Majeſty or Glory, as an
<hi>Angel;</hi> becauſe a <hi>deformed,</hi> or baſe appearance, had been <hi>unſuitable</hi>
to the Boaſt of giving the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the World, or to his deſire
that Chriſt ſhould <hi>fall down and worſhip him.</hi> Hence we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve:</p>
                     <p>That Satan ſometimes tempts in a viſible Appearance, and by
Voice.<note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, The poſſibility of this, is evident from the <hi>Apparitions</hi> of
Angels.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Riſcat.</hi> in loc.</note> Satan is ſtill an Angel, and there is nothing of a <hi>natural
Incapacity</hi> in him as to an outward <hi>Appearance</hi> to our Eyes and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
more than in glorify'd Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In the <hi>firſt</hi> Temptation he did no leſs, when he uſed
the <hi>Serpent,</hi> as a Trune to ſpeak through, and an Inſtrument to
act by; In <hi>poſſeſſions</hi> he ſpeaks audibly, and evidenceth a real preſence.</p>
                     <p>

Thirdly undoubted <hi>Inſtances</hi> may be given of Satans tempting
and moleſting viſibly. I deny not but there are a great many <hi>Idle-Stories</hi>
of this kind, and a number of ridiculous Figments, but it
would be unreaſonable and highly prejudicial to the truth of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,</hi>

<hi>Euſebius</hi> Diſciple of <hi>Hierom,</hi> who when he was dying, cryed out
of the Devils appearing to him. The like is ſtoryed of <hi>St. Martin</hi>
and others, and of theſe, you may read more collected by
Mr. <hi>Clark.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we would enquire into the reaſons of Satans appearing thus,
we cannot more fitly pitch upon any other than theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Either he thinks a great <hi>affrightment</hi> neceſſary in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and for that end appears: or,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He ſees his appearance needful, to give a greater <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
and certainty to the <hi>reality</hi> of the pleaſures of Sin which he
promiſeth; that is the common ground of his appearing in the
ways and deſigns of <hi>Witchcraft.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Or in the height of <hi>rage,</hi> when he perceives other
ways not available, and when he hath to do with Perſons not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of his devices, where he ſees he hath no need of a <hi>Viſor,</hi> or
covert ways of dealing, then he ſticks not (if permitted) to tempt
or moleſt openly.</p>
                     <p>This muſt teach us not to wonder at ſuch Temptations, much
leſs to judg thoſe that may be ſo moleſted, as if Satan had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                     <p>I ſhall Illuſtrate both theſe particulars by the example of <hi>Thomas
Savage,</hi> Apprentice to Mr. <hi>Collins Vintener</hi> at the <hi>Ship-Tavern</hi> in
<hi>Ratcliff,</hi> who ſuffered in <hi>Anno</hi> 1668, for murthering his Fellow-Servant:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49412:239"/>
He confeſſeth that the Devil took this courſe with him;
he firſt tempted him to <hi>neglect</hi> of Duty, then to <hi>contempt</hi> of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and <hi>Prophanation</hi> of the Sabbath, then to <hi>Drinking,</hi> then
to <hi>Fornication,</hi> then to <hi>Rob</hi> and <hi>Steal</hi> from his Maſter, and laſt of
all to <hi>Murther;</hi> and takes particular notice that in this laſt
Temptation, to kill his Fellow-Servant, there was a <hi>violent</hi> and
more than ordinary <hi>Power</hi> of Satan upon him, to inſtigate him to
that Wickedneſs. All this you may read at large in the Printed
Narration of his Life.</p>
                     <p>The reaſons of his Gradual proceedings are,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He would diſcover <hi>no more</hi> of himſelf in any Temptation,
than he is <hi>neceſſitated</hi> unto; for the gaining his end, leſt he croſs his
own deſign, and inſtead of drawing Men to Wickedneſs, ſcare or
affright them from it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Sins are <hi>mutually preparatory</hi> to each other, ſmaller
Proffers and Temptations do inſenſibly prepare, and incline the
Heart to greater.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he keeps his <hi>greateſt</hi> Temptations laſt, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of the former; for which (beſides what is now ſpoken)
theſe reaſons may be given:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, There is <hi>provocation</hi> given him, in refuſing his <hi>leſſer Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults.</hi>
His <hi>Head</hi> is <hi>bruiſed</hi> by every refuſal, he is ſet at defiance,
which calls him out to <hi>ſtronger</hi> oppoſition. He perceives by often
repulſes that thoſe with whom he hath to do are not Subjects of
his Kingdom, and that his <hi>time is ſhort,</hi> and therefore no wonder
is it, if he Aſſault moſt furiouſly, and with all his ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is alſo <hi>Policy</hi> in it, when he hath brought
down our ſtrength and weakned our courage, then a violent onſet
is fair to procure him a Victory.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe I mention a <hi>great</hi> Temptation, it may not be amiſs
both for the further explaining of the Text, and Illuſtration of
the matter, to ſhew what is a great Temptation. Theſe were
great Temptations to Chriſt, and there are ſeveral things remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
in them, which where ever they appear, they will denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the Temptation great, and the <hi>more</hi> of them are conjoyned
together, and in higher <hi>degree,</hi> it may juſtly be called ſtill the
greater. As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In theſe Temptations, we may note there were <hi>external
Objects,</hi> as well as inſinuated <hi>ſuggeſtions;</hi> Inward <hi>motions</hi> are <hi>real</hi>
Temptations, but when they have the <hi>Objects</hi> and things preſented
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49412:240"/>
to the <hi>Eye</hi> or the <hi>Senſes,</hi> then do they ſtrongly urge. At this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the Devil tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> he urged her when the Fruit was
within the view; Thus he tempted <hi>Achan,</hi> when the Gold and
Garment were in his Eye.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Theſe Temptations were <hi>complex,</hi> conſiſting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
various deſigns, like a ſnare of many cords or nooſes. When he
tempted to turn Stones to Bread, it was not one <hi>ſingle</hi> deſign, but
many that Satan had in proſecution. As <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> on one hand,
<hi>Pride</hi> on another, and ſo in the reſt. The more complicated a
Temptation is, 'tis the greater.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Theſe were alſo <hi>perplexing,</hi> entangling Temptations;
They were <hi>dilemmatical,</hi> ſuch as might enſnare, either in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or refuſal. If he had turned Stones into Bread, he had too
much <hi>honoured</hi> Satan by doing it at his <hi>Motion.</hi> If he did not, he
ſeemed to <hi>neglect</hi> his own <hi>Body,</hi> in not making neceſſary proviſions
for himſelf being now hungry.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Theſe Temptations proceeded upon conſiderable <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,</hi>
his <hi>Hunger</hi> urged a neceſſity of turning Stones into
Bread. His preſent <hi>ſtraits,</hi> and the lowneſs of his condition ſeemed
to ſpeak much for the reaſonableneſs of giving proof of his <hi>Divine
Nature,</hi> by caſting himſelf down from the Temple, and of doing
any thing, that might tend to a more <hi>plentiful</hi> Being and ſupport
in the World. Advantages ſtrengthen Temptations.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Theſe Temptations were accompanied with a greater
<hi>Preſence</hi> and Power of Satan, he appeared <hi>viſibly</hi> in them, and
was permitted to touch and hurry the Body of Chriſt, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paint
and ſet forth the Glory of the World (doubtleſs in the moſt
taking way) to the Eye of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The matter of theſe Temptations, or the things he
tempted Chriſt to, were great and <hi>heinous</hi> Abominations, (a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
of Providence, a preſumption of Protection, and a final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
of the Worſhip due to him, and transferring it to the
moſt unworthy Object, Gods profeſſed Enemy) and yet were
they ſeconded by the <hi>ſtrongeſt,</hi> moſt <hi>powerful,</hi> and moſt <hi>prevailing</hi>
means, as his preſent <hi>Straits,</hi> his infallible Aſſurance of <hi>Sonſhip,
Pleaſure,</hi> and Glory. Where the <hi>matter</hi> is weighty, and the <hi>medium</hi>
ſtrong and preſſing, there is the Temptation great.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, All theſe Temptations pretended ſtrongly to the
advantage and <hi>benefit</hi> of Chriſt, and ſome of them might ſeem
to be done without any <hi>blame,</hi> as to turn Stones to Bread, to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49412:240"/>
fly in the Air. The more <hi>kindneſs</hi> of Temptation pretends to us, it
is the ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, Satan urged ſome of them in a during provoking way;
<hi>If thou be the Son of God?</hi> as if he had ſaid, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>are thee to ſhew
thy ſelf what thou pretendeſt to be. Theſe kind of provocations are
very troubleſom to the moſt modeſt and ſelf-denying, who can
ſcarce forbear to do what they are urged unto at ſuch times.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, Theſe Temptations ſeem to be deſigned for the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement</hi>
of all the <hi>Natural</hi> Powers of Chriſt, his natural <hi>Appetite</hi>
in a deſign of Food; his <hi>Senſes,</hi> in the moſt Beautiful Object, the
World in its Glory; The <hi>Affections,</hi> in that which is moſt Swaying,
Pride, and delight in extraordinary Teſtimonies; of Divine Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and Love, in ſupporting him in the Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tenthly, Some of theſe warranted as <hi>Duty,</hi> and to ſupply
neceſſary hunger, others depending upon the ſecurity of a <hi>promiſe,
He ſhall give his Angels charge, &amp;c.</hi> The greater appearance of
Duty, or warrantableneſs is put upon Sin, the greater is the
Temptation.</p>
                     <p>By theſe ten Particulars may we (as by a Standard) judg, when
any Temptation is great or leſs.</p>
                     <p>Let us then take heed of <hi>ſmall</hi> Temptations,<note place="margin">Applic. 1.</note> or the <hi>ſmoother</hi>
proceedings of Satan, as we would avoid the <hi>greater</hi> attempts that
are to follow. Where he is admitted to beat out our Luſts with a
<hi>Rod</hi> or a <hi>Staff,</hi> he may be ſuſpected to bring the <hi>Wheel</hi> over them
at laſt.</p>
                     <p>Let us alſo after our Aſſaults, <hi>expect</hi> more and greater, becauſe
the greateſt are laſt to be looked for. This holds true in three ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
(1.) In <hi>ſolemn</hi> Temptations where Satan <hi>fixeth</hi> his Aſſaults,
there the utmoſt rage is drawn out laſt. (2.) In the <hi>Continuance</hi>
and Progreſs of Profeſſion, the further we go from him, and the
nearer to God, be ſure of the higheſt meaſure of his ſpite. (3.) At
the <hi>end</hi> of our race: for if he miſs his <hi>prey</hi> then, it is eſcaped for
ever, as a <hi>Bird</hi> unto its Hill.</p>
                     <p>But ſome may ſay,<note place="margin">Object.</note> I am but a Meſſenger of ſad tidings; and
that by bringing ſuch a report of <hi>Gyants,</hi> and <hi>Walled Cities,</hi> I may
make the hearts of the People to <hi>faint.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> This is bad news only to the <hi>ſluggiſh,</hi> ſuch as would
go to Heaven, with eaſe, and in a fair and eaſy way, but to the
<hi>laborious</hi> reſolute Souldiers of Chriſt this is no great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for (1.) It doth but tell them of their <hi>work,</hi> which as they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49412:241"/>
are perſwaded of, ſo it is in ſome meaſure their <hi>delight,</hi> as well
as their <hi>expectation.</hi> (2.) It doth but tell them, Satans <hi>Malice</hi> and
Fury, which they are aſſured of, and are moſt afraid of it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
when it ſeems to lye Idle and as aſleep. (3.) It doth tell
them that Satans thoughts concerning them are <hi>deſparing,</hi> he fears
they are going, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> gone from him. If they were his willing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
there would be no hoſtility of this nature againſt them.</p>
                     <p>I have thus compared theſe ſpecial Temptations with thoſe
wherewith our Lord Chriſt was exerciſed during the forty days.
I ſhall</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Compare</hi> theſe Temptations of Chriſt with thoſe that
uſually betal his <hi>Members,</hi> in which there is ſo much ſuitableneſs
and agreement, both in <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner,</hi> that it cannot be unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to take notice of it, which will the better appear in Inſtances.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Then let us conſider the firſt Temptation of <hi>Eve. Gen.</hi> 3. 6.
And <hi>when the Woman ſaw that the Tree was good for Food, and that
it was pleaſant to the Eyes, and a Tree to be deſired to make one wiſe,</hi> &amp;c.
Here are all the Arguments and ways ſummed up, by which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
prevailed upon her; It was <hi>good for Food,</hi> here he wrought
upon the deſire of the <hi>natural Appetite;</hi> It was <hi>pleaſant to the Eyes,</hi>
here he took the advantage of the <hi>External Senſes.</hi> It was <hi>to be
deſired to make one wiſe,</hi> here he enflamed the <hi>Affections.</hi> Let us
again call to mind the general Account of Temptations, in the
1 Joh. 2. 16. <hi>All that is in the World, the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt
of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life;</hi> where the Apoſtle deſignedly
calls all off from a love of the World, becauſe of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
and danger that we lye open unto, from the things
of the World, ſtriking upon and ſtirring up our <hi>Luſts;</hi>
which he ranks into three <hi>general heads,</hi> according to the
the <hi>various</hi> ways whereby theſe outward things do work upon us,
in exciting our <hi>natural</hi> powers and apprehenſions to ſinful <hi>luſtings:</hi>
And theſe are ſo fully agreeing with thoſe three in <hi>Eves</hi> Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that I need not note the Parallel. Let us now caſt our Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe Temptations, and the ſuitableneſs of Satans ways and
dealings will immediately appear. When he tempted Chriſt to
turn <hi>Stones into Bread,</hi> there he endeavoured to take advantage of
the <hi>Luſt of the Fleſh</hi> (which in the 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. I underſtand in a more
reſtrained Senſe, not for the luſtings of <hi>corrupt</hi> Nature, but for the
luſtings of the <hi>Body</hi> in its Natural <hi>Appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ite,</hi> according to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ſſion
of Chriſt, <hi>the Spirit is willing, but the Fleſh</hi> or body <hi>is weak:</hi>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49412:241"/>
And if we ſhould not ſo reſtrain it in this place, the Luſt of the
Fleſh would <hi>include</hi> the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life,
contrary to the clear ſcope of the Text, for theſe are alſo the luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of corrupt Nature.) When he further tempted him to <hi>caſt
himſelf down,</hi> he puſhed him upon the <hi>Pride of Life;</hi> When he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him the <hi>Kingdoms of the World and the glory of them,</hi> he attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to gain upon him by the <hi>Luſt of the Eyes.</hi> From this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
and ſuitableneſs of Temptation to Chriſt and his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Satan uſually treads in a beaten path,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>uſing known and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
Methods of Temptation.</hi> 'Tis true, in regard of <hi>Circumſtances,</hi>
he uſeth unſpeakable <hi>varieties</hi> in tempting, and hath many more
Devices and Juggles than can be reckoned up, yet in the <hi>General</hi> he
hath <hi>digeſted</hi> them into Method and Order, and the things upon
which he works in us, are the ſame; thus he walks his round,
and keeps much-what the ſame Track, not only in different Perſons,
but alſo in the ſame Men, uſing the ſame Temptations over
and over, and yet this argues no <hi>barrenneſs</hi> of Invention, or <hi>ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs</hi>
in Satan, but he hath theſe reaſons for it:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe the ſame Temptations being ſuited to <hi>humane
Nature</hi> in General, will with a ſmall Variation of <hi>Circumſtance</hi> ſuit
all Men; their Inclinations generally anſwering to one another, as
Face anſwers to Face in Water.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Theſe <hi>ſtanding</hi> Methods are Famous with him, as
<hi>generally</hi> powerful and taking, and it can be no wonder if Satan
<hi>practiſe</hi> moſt with theſe things, that have the largeſt <hi>Probatum eſt</hi>
of Experience to follow them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The more <hi>Experienced</hi> he is in any Temptation, the
more <hi>dexterouſly</hi> and ſucceſsfully ſtill he can manage it; ſo that
we may expect him <hi>more cunning</hi> and able in what he <hi>moſt practiſeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may be ſome ſatisfaction to thoſe that are apt to think of
themſelves and their Temptations;<note place="margin">Applic.</note> as <hi>Elias</hi> did in his perſwaſion,
I <hi>alone am left.</hi> Where Satan uſeth any thing of Vigour and
Fierceneſs, we are apt to ſay, <hi>none are tempted as we,</hi> none in <hi>like

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But 'tis a miſtake; even that of <hi>Solomon</hi> may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to theſe, <hi>there is nothing new,</hi> nor any thing befaln us, which
others have not undergon before us; and would but Chriſtians
be ſo careful, to <hi>obſerve</hi> the way of the Serpent upon their hearts,

                     <head>CHAP. VIII. The riſe of Chriſts firſt Temptation. Of Satans ſuiting his
Temptations to the conditions of Men. Of tempting
Men upon the plea of Neceſſity. The reaſons and cheats of
that plea. His pretences of friendſhip in tempting, with
the danger thereof.</head>
                     <p>HAving thus conſidered theſe Temptations as they lye before
us in their general Proſpect, I ſhall now ſpeak of this firſt
ſpecial Temptation in particular, in which (1.) the Riſe, or Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
(2.) the Temptation it ſelf, (3.) the Argument by which
Satan would enforce it, are to be diſtinctly noted.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, As to the <hi>Riſe</hi> of it, It is queſtioned by ſome, why Satan
begins with this Firſt, the cauſe they aſſign, (in part at leaſt) is
from his firſt ſucceſs againſt <hi>Eve,</hi> in a Temptation about <hi>eating,</hi> as
if this were the chief and moſt hopeful Arrow in his Quiver. But
we need not go ſo far, when the Evangeliſt is ſo punctual in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it down, in the latter end of the former verſe, <hi>he was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred.</hi>
This the Devil took notice of, and from hence took the riſe
of his Temptation, that by <hi>turning Stones to Bread</hi> for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his preſent hunger, he might be induced to make way for
the ſecret Stratagems which he had prepared againſt him on this
occaſion. Here I note,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That where Satan hath a deſign againſt any,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>he doth take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of their Condition, and ſuits his Temptation accordingly.</hi> Thus,
if Men be in Poverty, or in the enjoyments of Plenty, in Sickneſs
or Health, if in Afflictions, under Wrongs, in Diſcontents, or
carried to Advancements and Honours, or whatever elſe may be
conſiderable relating to them, he obſerves it, and orders his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
ſo, as to take in all the advantages that they will afford.
That 'tis his concern and Intereſt ſo to do, we may Imagine, upon
theſe grounds:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Our <hi>Conſent</hi> muſt be gained; this he cannot properly and
truly <hi>force,</hi> but muſt <hi>entice</hi> and deceive us to a complyance with him.</p>

Secondly, If our <hi>Condition</hi> ſpeak for him, and lye fair for the
furtherance of any device of his, our conſent is upon the matter
<hi>half gained;</hi> 'tis much, if ſo powerful an Advocate, as is <hi>our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
State,</hi> do not influence us to an Inclination.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This doth his work <hi>eaſily</hi> and effectually, he more
generally prevails by this courſe, and with leſs Labour.</p>
                     <p>This Policy of Satan ſhould advantage us,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> by ſuggeſting fit
<hi>Memorials</hi> to us, in our expectations of Temptation. Though
we know not all Satans thoughts, yet may we know where and
how he will uſually make an onſet, our <hi>Condition</hi> will tell us what
to look for. The <hi>Diſtreſſed</hi> and Afflicted may expect a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſuited to their <hi>Condition,</hi> as of murmuring, repining, revenge,
diſtruſt, uſe of indirect means, diſpairings, &amp;c. They that have
<hi>Peace</hi> and Plenty may be ſure they ſhall be tempted <hi>ſuitably,</hi> to
Pride, Boaſting, Covetouſneſs, Oppreſſion, Contempt of others, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
or whatever may be fit to be engraſted on that Stock; the
like may be ſaid of any other different condition. How fairly are
we forewarned, (by an obſervation made upon Satans proceeding
upon theſe advantages) where to expect him, and how to provide
againſt him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let us proceed to a further enquiry,</hi> How <hi>the Devil managed
this advantage of Chriſts hunger; he plainly urgeth him with a</hi>
neceſſity <hi>of providing ſupplies for himſelf, ſpreading before him his
deſire to eat, and the impoſſibility of help, in a Barren and Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Wilderneſs, as if he had ſaid,</hi> The want of the Body is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for, Nature and Religion conſents to this; the Wilderneſs affords
no help, ordinary means fail; there is therefore a neceſſity that ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
courſe be taken, Therefore trun Stones to Bread; this is not
unſuitable to the Condition and Power of him who is the Son of God.
<hi>At this rate he pleads.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerve then,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 7.</note> That Satan uſually endeavours to run his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the plea of neceſſity, and from thence to infer a duty.</p>
                     <p>When he cannot pretend a <hi>fair</hi> and direct way to irregular
Practices, he would <hi>break</hi> a Door and force a way by <hi>Neceſſity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Under this Notion of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> the Devil marſhals all thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
that ſeem to be of more than ordinary force, in their uſual
prevalencies. Thus he teacheth Men to think they are <hi>neceſſitated,</hi>
if they be carried by a ſtrong <hi>inclination</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> or if there be
an <hi>urgency</hi> and provocation from <hi>others,</hi> or if they be <hi>in ſtraits</hi> and
dangers; and ſometime he goes ſo high, as to teach Men that a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49412:243"/>
neceſſity is included in the very Fabrick of their <hi>natural principles,</hi> by
which they preſumptuouſly excuſe themſelves in being ſinful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by <hi>Nature</hi> they are ſo, and cannot be changed without <hi>ſpecial</hi>
Grace; ſcarce ſhall we meet any Man with ſeaſonable reproof for his
iniquity, but he will plead ſuch kind of neceſſities for himſelf, <hi>I could
not help it, I was ſtrongly carried, or, I was compelled; I muſt do ſo, or
elſe I could not eſcape ſuch a danger,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſons of this Policy, are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He knows that neceſſity hath a <hi>compulſive</hi> force, even to
things of (otherwiſe) greateſt abhorrencies: A treaſury of Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
is to be had in Famines, and beſieged places, where 'tis uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to eat unclean things, not only Creatures that are vile, but even
Dung and Entrails; nay ſo <hi>Tyrannical</hi> is Neceſſity, that it makes
inrodes into,<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 56.</note> and Conqueſts upon Nature it ſelf, cauſing <hi>the tender
and dilicate Woman, which would not adventure the Sole of her Foot
upon the ground for delicateneſs and tenderneſs, to have an evil Eye towards
the Huſband of her Boſom, towards her Son, and towards her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
A like <hi>force</hi> doth it exerciſe upon the Minds and <hi>Conſciences</hi>
of Men, it makes them riſe up againſt their <hi>Light,</hi> it engageth
Men to lay violent hands upon their own <hi>Convictions,</hi> to ſtifle and
extinguiſh them. How many mournful examples have we of this
kind? How many have <hi>apoſtatiſed</hi> from Truth (being terrifyed by
the urging neceſſities of danger) contrary to the higheſt <hi>Convictions</hi>
of Conſcience?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Neceſſity can do much to the <hi>darkning</hi> of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and <hi>change</hi> of the Judgment, by the ſtrong Influence it
hath upon the <hi>Affections.</hi> Men are apt to form their apprehenſions,
according to the dictates of Neceſſity; what they ſee to be <hi>hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
they are inclinable to judg to be <hi>evil;</hi> Men in ſtraits not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>violate</hi> their Reaſon, but ſometime by inſenſible ſteps (unknown
to themſelves) <hi>ſlide</hi> into a contrary Judgment of things, directly
croſs to what they have <hi>believed</hi> and profeſſed. Which perſwaſion
they owe not to any further <hi>acceſſion</hi> of Light, or new <hi>diſcovery</hi> of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
(for ofttimes, the <hi>ſame</hi> Arguments which in the abſence of
trouble they have contemned as <hi>weak</hi> by the Appearance of
danger put on another <hi>Face,</hi> and ſeem <hi>ſtrong)</hi> but to the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of their <hi>fears.</hi> And thus many in all Ages have altered their
Judgments and thoughts, not becauſe they <hi>knew more,</hi> but becauſe
they <hi>feared more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like Neceſſities do Men form to themſelves from exorbitant
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49412:244"/>
and greedy <hi>hopes</hi> and expectations of a better condition, compared
to that wherein they at preſent are, and the like Influence it hath
in the alteration of their Judgments. Let the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Spalato</hi> be
an example of this, who loathed the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion firſt, and
in <hi>England</hi> (whither he came for refuge) writ againſt it; but ſaw
a neceſſity (from the diſappointment of expectation) to change
his mind, returned to <hi>Rome</hi> again, and perſwaded himſelf that
that was <hi>true</hi> which he had formerly pronounced <hi>falſe;</hi> and ſo
writ againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as before he had done againſt
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

<hi>Chriſtian</hi> again.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Neceſſity offers an <hi>excuſe,</hi> if not a <hi>Juſtification</hi> of the
greateſt miſcarriages. <hi>Lot</hi> offered to expoſe his Daughters to the
raging Luſt of the <hi>Sodomites</hi> for the preſervation of his <hi>Angel-Strangers,</hi>
which ſurely he would in no wiſe have done, but that
he thought the preſent <hi>neceſſity</hi> might have <hi>excuſed</hi> him. <hi>Eſau</hi>
profan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ly fells his Birth-right, but excuſeth the matter ſo, <hi>Behold
I am at the point to die, and what profit ſhall this Birth-right do to me?
Aaron</hi> produceth a neceſſity, from the violent reſolves of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 32.</note> in Juſtification of himſelf in the matter of the Golden Calf,
<hi>Thou kneweſt that this people are ſet on miſchief.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Neceſſity is an <hi>univerſal plea,</hi> and fitted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of all Men, in all callings, and under all extravagancies;
The <hi>Tradeſman</hi> in his unlawful gains or overreaching, pleads a
neceſſity for it, from the hardneſs of the Buyer in other things;
the <hi>poor Man</hi> pleads a neceſſity for <hi>Stealing,</hi> and the <hi>Rich</hi> pleads
the ſame neceſſity for <hi>Revenge,</hi> and thus it ſerves all with a Pretext.</p>
                     <p>Theſe conſiderations diſcovering this courſe ſo hopeful, as to
this deſign of the Devil, he will be ſure to put us to this pinch
where he can. But beſides this, we may obſerve <hi>three</hi> Cheats in
this plea of Neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Sometimes he puts Men upon <hi>feigning</hi> a neceſſity, where
there is none. <hi>Saul</hi> ſacrificed upon a needleſs Suppoſal that <hi>Samuel</hi>
not coming at the time appointed, there was a neceſſity for him to
do it. He ſpared alſo the Cattel upon the like pretence, that it
was a neceſſary proviſion for Sacrifice. And thus would the
Devil have perſwaded Chriſt, that there was an abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49412:244"/>
to turn Stones to Bread, when in Truth there was no ſuch
need.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Sometimes he puts Men upon a neceſſity of their own
<hi>ſinful procurement. Herod</hi> ſware to gratify the Daughter of <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi>
and this is preſently pleaded as a neceſſity for the cutting, off
<hi>John Baptiſts</hi> head. <hi>Saul</hi> forbad the taſting of Meat, and ſealed
the penalty by an Oath and Curſe, and this is by and by made a
neceſſity for the taking away of <hi>Jonathans</hi> Life, (who had taſted
Honey not knowing his Fathers Curſe) had not the People reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued
him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Sometime he <hi>ſtretcheth</hi> a neceſſity further than it ought;
he knows that God hath ſuch a regard to <hi>real</hi> neceſſities, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that ground, he will <hi>diſpence</hi> with his Sabbath, and the preſent
performance of Duty. Theſe inſtances he lays before men, and
endeavours to perſwade them, that in like manner God will
(upon a neceſſity) diſpence with <hi>Sins,</hi> as well as with the preſent
Opportunity of <hi>Service.</hi> What a covering (in all Ages) Men
have made of neceſſity, for their higheſt outrages and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies,
and with what confidence they have managed ſuch pleas,
would be endleſs to relate.</p>
                     <p>This muſt warn us,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> not to ſuffer our ſelves to be <hi>Impoſed</hi> upon,
by the higheſt pretences of Neceſſity. Whatever it may diſpenſe
with (as in <hi>ſome caſes</hi> it will ſuſpend a preſent <hi>Service,</hi> and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
the performance of a Duty,<note place="margin">Ferenda magis omnis neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas quam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petranda ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua iniquitas. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>beſides</hi> the common rule and way
wherein it ought ordinarily to be managed) it muſt never be
pleaded to give warranty to any thing in its <hi>own nature</hi> ſinful.
Neceſſity will not juſtify Lying, Stealing, Covetouſneſs, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides; we muſt be <hi>wary</hi> in judging what is a neceſſity. Men are
apt to plead a neceſſity where there is none, and if we <hi>give way</hi> to
a facile admittance of excuſes of this kind, we ſhall preſently <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply</hi>
neceſſities, and have them to ſerve us at every turn. Some
would warrant Sin by neceſſity, others would turn off Duty and
rule by pretending a neceſſity where none is: both are to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as Snares of Satan.</p>
                     <p>Once more (before we diſmiſs this riſe of the Temptation of
Chriſt in hand) let us obſerve that in perſwading him to turn
Stones to Bread, he ſeems to expreſs a great deal of <hi>care</hi> and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
to Chriſt, with an <hi>invidious Reflection</hi> upon the Love and
Providence of God; as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>I ſee thou art hungry, and this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49412:245"/>
Wilderneſs affords nothing to eat, and God hath not taken care to ſpread
a Table for thee, I therefore pittying thy Condition, as a Friend, adviſe
thee to turn Stones to Bread.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Note,<note place="margin">Obſ. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>That Satan manageth his moſt cruel deſigns, under the higheſt
pretences of Friendſhip.</hi> He did ſo with <hi>Eve, The Lord knoweth that
ye ſhall be as Gods;</hi> as if he had a greater regard to them, than God
himſelf. He tempted Chriſt in the Mouth of <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>ſpare himſelf,</hi>
under the ſhew of great kindneſs; and no leſs are his common
pretences to all Men. This is a deep Policy, for by this means
the <hi>miſchief</hi> intended is the better <hi>concealed,</hi> and the leſs <hi>care</hi> and
proviſion made againſt it; and beſides, the <hi>Affections</hi> and deſires are
ſtirred up to an <hi>haſty</hi> imbracement of the Motion, and an eager
ſwallowing of the Bait.</p>
                     <p>So great a Subtilty is in this manner of dealing, that thoſe who
affect the name of great <hi>Politicians</hi> in the World, have learned from
Satan to ſhew greateſt <hi>reſpects,</hi> and a moſt friendly countenance to
thoſe whom they moſt <hi>hate,</hi> and intend to ruine. Thus our <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
the Third of <hi>England</hi> conſtantly dealt with thoſe for whoſe
Blood he lay in wait: and the precepts of <hi>Machiavil</hi> are fitted to
this, that tis Wiſdom <hi>to hug thoſe whom we deſire to deſtroy. Ehud's</hi>
Preſent made way for his Dagger. <hi>Joab's</hi> Sword could not ſo
well have diſpatched its errand upon <hi>Abner,</hi> if he had not uſhered
it in with a Kiſs.</p>
                     <p>This ſhould make us moſt <hi>ſuſpect</hi> thoſe Temptations that offer
us moſt <hi>kindneſs</hi> and advantage,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> and ſuch as are moſt gratifying to
our Humours and Deſires. For can it be imagined in good earneſt
that Satan intends us a real good? Can the Gifts of Enemies paſs
for Courteſies and Favours with any,<note place="margin">Timeo <hi>Dana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os</hi> &amp; dona fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes.</note> but ſuch as are bewitched
into a blockiſh madneſs? Satan is more to be feared when he <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
than when he <hi>regeth;</hi> and though ſuch offers may be looked
upon by ſome as more benign, and leſs odious Temptations, (as
ſome kind of <hi>Familiar Spirits</hi> are more kindly treated by ſome,
under the notion of <hi>white Devils)</hi> yet may we ſay of them as <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>The thing urged, was the turning or changing the <hi>form</hi> of a
Creature, which is a work truely <hi>miraculous</hi> and wonderful, and
ſuch as had neither bee <hi>unſuited</hi> to the power of Chriſt, nor <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
in it ſelf. 'Tis from hence juſtly queſtioned, where the ſting
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49412:246"/>
of this ſuggeſtion lay, or in what point was the temptation couched.
Firſt, It was not in the <hi>unlawfulneſs</hi> or ſinfulneſs of the thing men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
For Chriſt did as much as would amount to all this,
when he turned <hi>Water</hi> into <hi>Wine,</hi> and when he fed Multitudes by
a miraculous <hi>multiplication</hi> of a few Loaves and Fiſhes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It was not <hi>unſuitable</hi> to his condition, as <hi>hungry;</hi> for
ſo it ſeemed a Duty to provide for himſelf, and which Satan took
for granted.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Neither ſeemed it any <hi>derogation</hi> to his Power and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, but rather an <hi>advantage</hi> and fit opportunity to
give a full proof of it, to the <hi>ſtopping</hi> of Satans Mouth for
ever.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding theſe, there was <hi>Poyſon</hi> and Malignity enough
in the <hi>ſuggeſtion,</hi> and under theſe Green <hi>Leaves</hi> of plauſible preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
lay hid many <hi>Snakes.</hi> For (1.) By this was he ſecretly tempted
to admit of a <hi>doubting</hi> of the truth of the divine <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> lately
declaring him to be the <hi>Son of God.</hi> (2.) As alſo further to <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi>
his Fathers Providence and Love; (3.) and unneceſſarily to
run out of the <hi>ordinary</hi> way of ſupply, and to betake himſelf to
<hi>indirect</hi> means or extraordinary courſes. (4.) And all this to the
<hi>abuſe</hi> and undervaluing of his power, in <hi>proſtituting</hi> it to Satans <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
or perſwaſion; and the Devil had gained a conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
if he could have prevailed with him to do ſuch a thing by
his inſtigation. (5.) It may be, he further thought this might
entice to an high <hi>eſteem</hi> of himſelf, and ſo make way for a vain
<hi>oſtentation</hi> of his power, and Intereſt in God. All or moſt of theſe
ſeem to be the deſign that the Devil was driving forward. Several
things are hence obſervable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That where Satan doth not judge it his preſent Intereſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>to ſuggeſt to
us things in their own nature ſinful, he will move us to things good in
themſelves, in hopes thereby to lead us into evil.</hi> This way of tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is from a more refined Policy, than down-right motions to
Sin; and doubtleſs 'tis leſs ſuſpected, and conſequently more
taking. The Evils that Satan would introduce by this Method,
are ſuch as theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Sometime when he tempts us to that which is Good,
it is, that he might <hi>affright</hi> us from it; his approbation is
enough to put a diſcredit, and diſgraceful ſuſpition upon any
thing.<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 29.</note> Such a deſign had he, when he gave <hi>teſtimony</hi> for Chriſt,
<hi>That he was the Son of God;</hi> or for the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that they were the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49412:246"/>
Servants of the <hi>moſt high God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 16. 17.</note> It was not his intention, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him or them, by bearing them witneſs, but to bring them
under Suſpition, and Trouble.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There are a great <hi>many ways</hi> to miſcarry in a <hi>lawful</hi>
Action, either by propounding <hi>bad ends,</hi> or by <hi>failures</hi> in the
<hi>manner</hi> of performance, or by a <hi>miſimprovement</hi> of the whole.
Theſe miſcarriages (and the poſſibility, and probability of
them) Satan carries in his mind; yet doth he not at firſt <hi>propound</hi>
them, but moving us unto the thing, he hath an <hi>expectation</hi> that
we will <hi>ſlide</hi> into them of our ſelves, or be <hi>inclined</hi> by ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
touch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> of <hi>ſuggeſtion</hi> upon our minds; together with the
<hi>tendency,</hi> or improveableneſs of the thing or Action, to ſuch
evils as are properly conſequent to it. Satan did not here tempt
Chriſt to theſe ſinful ends <hi>directly,</hi> but to an <hi>Action</hi> which he
hoped might <hi>inſenſibly</hi> produce them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Another Evil hereby aimed at, is the <hi>hindrance</hi> of a
<hi>greater</hi> Good, not only as a <hi>diverſion</hi> to turn us off a better or more
profitable occaſion, but alſo as an <hi>unſeaſonable interruption</hi> of
ſomething at preſent more concerning us: Thus he makes the
<hi>ſuggeſtion</hi> of Good things, the <hi>hindrance</hi> of Prayer, or Hearing.</p>
                     <p>Some will ſay,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> This is a <hi>perplexing</hi> caſe, that in things good or
lawful in themſelves Men ſhould be in ſuch dangers, and will
thereupon deſire to know, how they may <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> Satans <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances</hi>
and Motions, from thoſe that have <hi>no dependance</hi> upon
him, or are from the Spirit of God?</p>
                     <p>In anſwer to this.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> (1.) Let us (when we fear thus to be
circumvented) look well to what <hi>Impreſſions</hi> are upon our Spirit,
when we are moved to what may be <hi>lawful.</hi> For <hi>tog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ther</hi> with
the motion (if it be Satans) we ſhall find either a corrupt <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
and <hi>end</hi> privatly <hi>riſing</hi> up in our Mind; or we may obſerve
that our hearts are <hi>out of order,</hi> and perverſly inclined; this is
oft unſeen to our ſelves. When the Diſciples moved Chriſt to
bring down <hi>fire from Heaven,</hi> if they had conſidered the preſent <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengful</hi>
ſelfiſh frame of their Spirits, (which our Lord tells them,
they were <hi>ignorant</hi> of) they might eaſily have known that the
motion had proceeded from Satan.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>concurrent</hi> Circumſtances of the thing or Action,
are to be ſeriouſly weighed; for from thence we may take a right
<hi>meaſure</hi> of the conveniency or inconveniency of the proceeding
in it. What is from Satan, it will be either <hi>unſeaſonable</hi> as to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49412:247"/>
the Time, Place, and Perſon, or ſome <hi>other</hi> thing will appear
that may give a <hi>diſcovery.</hi> As here Chriſt refuſeth to turn Stones
to Bread, becauſe not only the <hi>way</hi> and manner of the Propoſal
doth ſufficiently lay open the <hi>Deſign,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of
Chriſt's condition at that time, ſhewed the motion to be <hi>unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
and inconvenient: for if Satan had urged the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it for
the ſatisfaction of his <hi>hunger;</hi> Chriſt could have anſwered, that
the <hi>experience</hi> that he had of Gods ſupport for <hi>forty days</hi> together,
was ſufficient to engage him to <hi>rely</hi> yet further upon him. If he
had urged farther, that by this means he might have had a full
<hi>proof</hi> of Gods love and care, or of his <hi>Sonſhip:</hi> It was at hand to
tell him, that it was needleſs to ſeek a further <hi>evidence,</hi> when God
had given <hi>one</hi> ſo full a little before: If again he had pleaded it to
have been an uſeful <hi>occaſion</hi> to give a <hi>teſtimony</hi> of his Power to the
ſatisfaction of others: He could have told him, that it had been
<hi>impertinent</hi> to have done it then, when he was in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi>
where none could have the benefit of it: So that nothing Satan
could have propounded as a reaſon for that Miracle, but it might
have been repelled from a conſideration of his preſent condition.</p>
                     <p>The Inſtruction that may be gathered from this,<note place="margin">Applic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> is, That we
muſt not entertain thoughts of doing <hi>lawful things,</hi> without a
due <hi>enquiry</hi> into the <hi>temper</hi> of our own Hearts, and a full conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of all <hi>Circumſtances</hi> round about, with the probable ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies,
and conſequences of it.</p>
                     <p>But (may ſome ſay) If I judge ſuch a motion to be a thing
<hi>lawful,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Queſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> which doth proceed from Satan, What am I to do?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> (1.) Conſider whether the Good be <hi>neceſſary</hi> or
not: if it be neceſſary, 'tis a <hi>duty</hi> and not to be forborn, only
the <hi>abuſes</hi> are to be watched againſt, and avoided.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If it be a <hi>duty,</hi> Conſider whether it be <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> or
<hi>unſeaſonable, neceſſary</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> as to the preſent time; if it be <hi>not,</hi>
it may be <hi>ſuſpended,</hi> and a <hi>fitter</hi> opportunity waited for.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If it be only <hi>lawful,</hi> and not <hi>neceſſary,</hi> we ought to
<hi>abſtain</hi> from it <hi>wholly,</hi> after the example of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39. 2.
who <hi>abſtained even from Good,</hi> (that is, from <hi>lawful</hi> bemoanings
of himſelf, or complainings againſt <hi>Abſalom,</hi> that had rebelled
againſt him) becauſe it was not neceſſary, and (the circumſtances
of his condition conſidered) very dangerous, leſt <hi>vent</hi> and way
being given, he might have been eaſily <hi>drawn</hi> to ſpeak paſſionately,
or diſtruſtfully againſt God, and fooliſhly againſt Providences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:49412:247"/>
That the thing unto which Satan moved Chriſt was lawful,
hath been noted. Next let us conſider what <hi>Ends</hi> Satan might
propound to himſelf in this Motion, and we ſhall ſee (as hath
been ſaid) that he did not ſo narrow and contract his deſign, as
that only <hi>one</hi> thing took up his Intentions, but <hi>ſeveral.</hi> Hence
have we this Obſervation;</p>
                     <p>That in one ſingle Temptation Satan may have various Aims and
Deſigns.<note place="margin">Obſ. 10.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Temptation is a <hi>complicated</hi> thing, a <hi>many-headed Monſter.</hi>
Satan hath always many things in his Eye. Firſt, In every
Temptation there is a <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> deſign, a main thing
that the Devil would have.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There are ſeveral things <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the main deſign,
as ſteps, degrees, or means leading to it; the leſſer ſtill making way
for the greater. If Satan deſign <hi>Murther,</hi> he lays the Foundation of
his work in inward <hi>Grudgings</hi> and <hi>Hatreds;</hi> next he gives <hi>Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi>
by reproachful Words, or diſdainful Carriages and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviours,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 22.</note> (as our Saviour notes in the expreſſions of <hi>Racha,</hi>
and <hi>Fool)</hi> and ſo by degrees enticeth on to Murther. The like
we may obſerve in the luſts of Uncleanneſs, and other things.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Beſides theſe there are uſually <hi>Reſerves,</hi> ſomething
in <hi>ambuſhment</hi> to watch our <hi>Retreats;</hi> for Satan conſiders what
to do in caſe we repel, and refuſe his motion, that ſo he may not
altogether labour in vain. A contrary <hi>extreme</hi> watcheth thoſe
that fly from a Temptation; <hi>Pride, Security, Self-Confidence,</hi> and
<hi>Boaſting,</hi> are ready to take them by the <hi>Heel:</hi> So truly may it be
ſaid of Satan, that <hi>he knoweth the way that we take; if we go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
he is there; if backward, we may alſo perceive him; on the
left hand, he is at work; and on the right hand, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> is not idle.</hi> All
theſe we may particularly ſee in this Temptation in Hand: He
had a main deſign (of which more preſently:) he prepares
means and ſeconds, to help it forward; ſuch were thoſe pleas of
<hi>neceſſity,</hi> and <hi>conveniency</hi> which the hunger and want of Chriſt did
furniſh him withall, and there wanted not the <hi>reſerves</hi> of <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Self-neglect</hi> in caſe he reſiſted the motion.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſons of this Policy are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When Satan tempts, he is not <hi>certain</hi> of his prevalency,
even when the probabilities are the greateſt, and therefore doth
he <hi>provide</hi> himſelf with ſeveral things at once; that if the tempted
Party <hi>nauſeat</hi> one thing, there may be another in readineſs that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49412:248"/>
may pleaſe his <hi>Palat.</hi> God gives this advice to the Spiritual
Seedſmen, <hi>In the Morning ſow thy Seed, and in the Evening withhold
not thine Hand; for thou knoweſt not what ſhall proſper, whether this
or that.</hi> Satan, that Seedſman of the <hi>Tares,</hi> imitates this; and
becauſe he knows not what ſhall proſper, therefore doth he uſe
variety.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Where many things are at once deſigned, 'tis an
hundred to one they will not <hi>all</hi> return <hi>empty;</hi> 'Tis much if many
ſnares miſs, he that hath broken one or two, may not only be
inticed with a third Temptation, (as being either <hi>wearied</hi> out
with the Aſſaults, or made <hi>plyable</hi> with the allurements of the
former) but may alſo ſit down <hi>ſecure,</hi> as having (in his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal)
paſſed all the danger, and ſo unawares fall into an unſeen or
unſuſpected Trap.</p>
                     <p>This may (1.) by way of Caution aſſure us that we have no
cauſe to think that <hi>all fear</hi> is over,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> when we have avoided the
more <hi>obvious</hi> and <hi>conſpicuous</hi> deſignments of a Temptation, but
rather to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> ſome further train than we yet have diſcovered.
(2.) That there is a neceſſity for us to be <hi>circumſpect</hi> every way,
and <hi>Janus-like</hi> to have an Eye before and behind, that we may
make timely diſcoveries of what Satan intends againſt us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As we have taken a view of the</hi> various <hi>deſignments of Satan
in</hi> one <hi>Temptation, ſo 'tis alſo remarkable, that theſe various ways
of his in this Temptation, do give</hi> ſtrength one to another, <hi>and have
as cloſe a connection, as Stones in an Arch. Chriſt was pleaſed to
commend the</hi> wiſdom <hi>of the unjuſt Steward, though he intended
not the leaſt approbation of his</hi> diſhoneſty: <hi>So may we turn aſide
and obſerve the</hi> cunning Artifice <hi>of the Devil, in the management
of this Argument againſt Chriſt, which is to this purpoſe, as if
he had thus proceeded;</hi> If thou art the Son of God, (as the Voice from
Heaven lately teſtifyed) it can be no inconvenience, but every way an
advantage to give a further proof of it: Thy preſent condition of want
and hunger, ſeem to contradict it: for how ſtrange and unbeſeeming is it,
for the Son of God to be in ſuch Straits? Yet if thou beeſt what thou ſayeſt
thou art, 'tis eaſy for thee to help thy ſelf; God that made the World
of nothing, by the power of his command, can much more change the
forms of things that are made already; 'tis but ſpeaking, and theſe
Stones that are before thee will be turned into Bread; and beſides that
in ſo doing thou maiſt ſeaſonably vindicate thy ſelf from the Eclipſe of
thy preſent condition, Neceſſity and Duty (for 'tis Duty to ſupply
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49412:248"/>
the want of the Body, which cannot be ſupported without its proper nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment)
compel thee unavoidably to it, except thou feareſt not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the Guilt of ſelf-deſtruction, eſpecially ſeeing I do not urge thee to
provide Delicacies, but only Bread, and ſuch as is needful to keep in the
Lives of the pooreſt Men, in the pooreſt manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hence note,</hi>

                     <p>THe various aims of Satan, and their <hi>cloſe</hi> dependance one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another, having contributed to us their ſeveral Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
it remains, that we ask after the <hi>main</hi> and chief thing that
Satan <hi>principally</hi> intended. And to make way to this, it muſt be
noted, that in <hi>grand</hi> Temptations <hi>eſpecially,</hi> the <hi>main</hi> deſign of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
comprehends theſe <hi>two;</hi> The chief <hi>End,</hi> and the chief <hi>Means</hi>
conducing to that End. About theſe ſome Authors conjecture
variouſly, whoſe differences we have no great occaſion to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſeeing the Text gives ſo great a ſatisfaction in this
matter.</p>
                     <p>For Firſt, The main <hi>End</hi> of Satan, we have (not obſcurely)
expreſſed to us in theſe words <hi>[If thou be the Son of God:]</hi> which if
we compare with <hi>Matth. 3. 17. This is my beloved Son, in whom I
am well pleaſed,</hi> we ſhall eaſily apprehend, that here Satan doth
but <hi>eccho</hi> to that Voice which came down from Heaven; As he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49412:249"/>
did with <hi>Eve; God had ſaid, of the Tree in the midſt of the Garden
ye ſhall not eat,</hi> Satan (having as it were the ſound of this yet in his
Ears) in a clear <hi>reference</hi> to it, ſaith, <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, ye ſhall
not eat?</hi> So here is alſo an evident <hi>reſpect</hi> to God's <hi>Teſtimony</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
Chriſt, as if he had ſaid, <hi>hath God ſaid, thou art his Son? If
thou beeſt indeed ſuch as he teſtifyed, give ſome proof of it? &amp;c.</hi> By
which it appears that his deſign was to <hi>undermine</hi> this Teſtimony,
or ſome way or other to <hi>defeat</hi> it; neither need it paſs for an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
againſt this, that Satan doth not <hi>directly</hi> mention his doubt
or diſtruſt, nor <hi>poſitively</hi> ſuggeſt to Chriſt, a <hi>queſtioning</hi> or misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of his <hi>Son-ſhip,</hi> for it was not ſuitable to his Policy, ſo to lay
open his main End, that muſt have been expected afterward, as
the <hi>laſt</hi> in execution (if it had taken effect) though it were <hi>firſt</hi> in
intention.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>chief Means</hi> by which he would have brought
this End about, may be underſtood from Chriſt's <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the
Temptation: for it cannot but be imagined, that Chriſt knew the
<hi>bottom</hi> of Satans Policy, and that his <hi>Anſwer</hi> muſt fully <hi>confront</hi> the
<hi>Means</hi> by which Satan indeavoured to <hi>enſnare</hi> him. His Anſwer
was, <hi>Man lives not by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth
out of the Mouth of God.</hi> If we can then come to a certain under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of this Scripture (which is not difficult) we ſhall evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know the mind of the Temptation, to which this is a direct
Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words are cited out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 3. which ſome interpret
to this Senſe;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid.</hi> Lightfoot Harmon. <hi>in</hi> Matth. 4. Pool <hi>Synopſis in</hi> Deut. 8.</note> as if Chriſt had ſaid, Man hath not only a Life of
the <hi>Body</hi> (which is mentioned by Bread) to look after, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life of the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is of ſo great concernment; that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
life is to be neglected, rather than that of the Soul to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered.
This is a truth in it ſelf, but is apparently beſides the
meaning of <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. Neither doth it afford ſo full and particular an
anſwer as (doubtleſs) Chriſt intended. But let us conſider the
Text, and we ſhall find more in it; for <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt ſets down Gods
dealing with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, in that he ſuffered them to
hunger, and took from them the <hi>ordinary</hi> means of Life, which
(as the latter part of the verſe ſhews) is to be underſtood of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Bread, and then to ſupply that want, he fed them by an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi>
means, (ſuch as they had never heard of before) this
was by <hi>Manna.</hi> Next he makes an <hi>Inference</hi> from this way of
God's proceeding, improving this <hi>particular</hi> to <hi>a general rule, That
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49412:249"/>
he might make thee know, that Man lives not by Bread only, but by every
Word that procedeth out of the Mouth of the Lord doth Man live:</hi>
which is clearly of this Import, that Man lives not by <hi>ordinary</hi>
means only, but that God can provide for his Life in an <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
way, by appointing any thing to that end, through his
mighty and powerful Word, and good Pleaſure; So that things
never ſo unuſual, or unfit in themſelves for nouriſhment, will
become ſtrengthning to us, if he ſhall give out his command.
Chriſt then applying this, in this Senſe, did (as it were) thus ſay
to Satan; <hi>Though I want ordinary means of Life, which is Bread, yet
I know God can make any thing which he pleaſeth, to nouriſh me inſtead
of it. So that I will not caſt off a dependance upon the Providence of
God in this ſtrait, and without warrant run to an extraordinary courſe
for ſupply.</hi> Hence it is evident that to bring about his <hi>main</hi> End
(which was to <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> of his Relation to God) he uſed this
means, that by reaſon of his ſtrait, in the failure of <hi>ordinary</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
he ſhould <hi>diſtruſt</hi> Providence, and without warrant provide
for himſelf. Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>That where Satan carries on a main Deſign and End,<note place="margin">Obſ. 12.</note> he beſtows moſt
of his pains and skill in rendring the Means to that End plauſible and
taking. <hi>The End is</hi> leaſt <hi>in mention, and the Means in their fit
contrivance, takes up</hi> moſt <hi>of his Art and Care. The Reaſons
whereof are theſe:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, The End is apparently <hi>bad,</hi> ſo that it would be a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to his deſign to mention it, 'tis the ſnare and trap it ſelf,
which his Wiſdom and Policy directs him to cover; His <hi>ultimate</hi>
End is the deſtruction of the Soul, this he dare not openly <hi>avouch</hi>
to the vileſt of Men; he doth not ſay to them <hi>deſtroy your Souls, bring
eternal miſeries upon your ſelves,</hi> but only tempts them to that which
will bring this miſery upon them; and as for thoſe <hi>intermediate</hi>
ends, which are the formal acts of Sin, he uſeth alſo a kind of
<hi>modeſty</hi> in their concealment; he doth not uſually ſay, <hi>go and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or commit Adultery:</hi> But rather puts them upon <hi>ways</hi> or means
that will <hi>bring</hi> them up to thoſe Iniquities, except that he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
have to deal with thoſe that are ſo hardned in Sin, that they
<hi>make a ſport to do wickedly,</hi> and then he can more freely diſcover his
Ends to ſuch in the Temptation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Means to ſuch wicked Ends, have not only an
<hi>Innate,</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> tendency in themſelves, which are apt to
Sway and Byas Men that way, but are alſo capable of Artificial
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49412:250"/>
                        <hi>Improvement,</hi> to a <hi>further</hi> inticement to the evils ſecretly intended,
and theſe require the Art and Skill for the exact ſuiting and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them. The <hi>End</hi> cannot be reached without the <hi>Means,</hi> and
<hi>Means</hi> ſo ordered (without the aid of Grace) will ſcarce <hi>miſs</hi> of the
End.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Means are capable of a <hi>Varniſh</hi> and Paint, he can
make a ſhift to ſet them off, and Colour them over, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
drift of them cannot eaſily be diſcovered, whereas the Ends to
which theſe lead cannot receive, (at leaſt ſo eaſily with ſome) ſuch
<hi>fair</hi> ſhews. 'Tis far eaſier to ſet off Company-keeping, with the
pleaſurable pretences of Neceſſity or <hi>refreſhing divertiſement,</hi> than
to propound <hi>direct</hi> Drunkenneſs, (the thing to which Company-keeping
tends) under ſuch a dreſs.</p>
                     <p>If it be <hi>demanded,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> How and by what <hi>Arts</hi> he renders the Means
ſo <hi>plauſible?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I ſhall endeavour a ſatisfaction to that <hi>Quere,</hi> by
ſhewing the <hi>way</hi> that Satan took to render the Means he made uſe
of in this Temptation, <hi>plauſible</hi> to Chriſt, which were theſe;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He repreſents it, as a <hi>harmleſs</hi> or lawful thing in it ſelf;
Who can ſay it had been ſinful for the Son of God to have turned
Stones into Bread, more than to turn Water into Wine?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He gives the Motion a further pretext of advantage
or <hi>goodneſs,</hi> he inſinuated that it might be an uſeful <hi>diſcovery</hi> of his
Sonſhip, and a profitable <hi>ſupply</hi> againſt hunger.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He ſeems alſo to put a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> upon it, that other
ways of help failing, he muſt be conſtrained ſo to do, or to ſuffer
further want.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He forgets not to tell him, that to do this was but
<hi>ſuitable</hi> to his <hi>Condition,</hi> and that it was a thing well becoming the
<hi>Son of God</hi> to do a <hi>Miracle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, He doth urge it at the rate of a <hi>Duty,</hi> and that being in
hunger and want, it would be a <hi>ſinful neglect</hi> not to do what he
<hi>could</hi> and <hi>might</hi> for his preſervation.</p>
                     <p>The ſame way doth he take in <hi>other</hi> Temptations, in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
pleading <hi>all,</hi> in ſome <hi>moſt</hi> of theſe things, by which the
means conducing thereunto may ſeem plauſible. If he preſents
to Men <hi>occaſions</hi> of ſinning, he will tell them ordinarily, that they
may <hi>lawfully</hi> adventure upon them, that they are <hi>harmleſs,</hi> nay of
<hi>advantage,</hi> as tending to the recreating of the Spirits, and health
of the Body; yea, that 'tis <hi>neceſſary</hi> for them to take ſuch a liberty,
and that in doing ſo, they do but what <hi>others</hi> do that profeſs
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49412:250"/>
Religion. And often he hath ſuch advantage from the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi>
of the thing, and the <hi>Inclination</hi> of our heart, that he makes
bold to tell us. 'Tis no leſs then <hi>Duty,</hi> ſuch did the outrage of
<hi>Demetrius</hi> ſeem to him, when he conſidered, how much his live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood
did depend upon the <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians; Paul's</hi> Zeal
made him confident that <hi>perſecution</hi> of Chriſtians was his <hi>Duty:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any thing which can pretend to any <hi>Zeal, Advantage</hi>
or colourable <hi>Ground,</hi> but preſently it takes the denomination
of <hi>Duty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any wonder that ſuch <hi>poor</hi> and ſhallow pretences are not <hi>ſeen</hi>
through by all Men, they may know that this happens from a
<hi>fourfold</hi> Ignorance.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, from an Ignorance of the <hi>thing it ſelf:</hi> how eaſily may they
be Impoſed upon, who know not the nature, or the uſual Iſſues
of things? as Children are deluded to put a value upon an uſeleſs,
or hurtful trifle; ſo are Men deceived and eaſily impoſed upon in
what they do not underſtand. And for this cauſe, are Sinners
compared to Birds, who are eaſily <hi>inticed</hi> with the Bait propoſed to
their <hi>view,</hi> as profitable and good for them, becauſe they know
not the <hi>Snare</hi> that lyes hid under it: this Ignorance cauſing the
miſtake mentioned, is not only a <hi>Simple</hi> Ignorance, but alſo that
Ignorance which owes its riſe to a <hi>wilful</hi> and perverſe diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(for there are ſome that are <hi>willingly Ignorant)</hi> doth often lay
thoſe open to a deluſion, who through <hi>prepoſſeſſion</hi> or <hi>idleneſs,</hi> will
not be at <hi>pains</hi> to make full Inquiries.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This alſo comes to paſs from an Ignorance of <hi>our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:</hi>
for while we either engage in the things propoſed by Satan
upon the <hi>general warranty</hi> of a <hi>good</hi> Intention, or that we have no
<hi>evil</hi> meaning in it, we are kept from a <hi>diſcovery</hi> of the intended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
Hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw nothing, in his perſecuting the <hi>Church</hi> of
God, of what Satan aimed at; or while upon the <hi>pretence</hi> of a
good <hi>Intention,</hi> our ſecret corrupt <hi>Principles</hi> do indeed move us
<hi>underhand</hi> to any undertaking, we are as little apt to ſee the Ends
of Satan in what he propounds to us.<note place="margin">Luke 9. 55.</note> 
                        <hi>Jehu,</hi> and the <hi>Diſciples</hi>
pretending a <hi>Zeal</hi> for God, but really carried on by their own <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
tempers,</hi> did as little, as others ſee what the Devil was doing
with them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The means of a Temptation are rendred leſs ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
from an Ignorance of the <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> and Concomitants
that do attend them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:49412:251"/>
Fourthly, As alſo from an Ignorance of our own <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and
<hi>Inclination,</hi> while we are <hi>confident</hi> of greater <hi>ſtrength</hi> to reſiſt, than
indeed we have, of a greater <hi>averſneſs,</hi> than is in us, to the evil
ſuſpected; we <hi>contemn</hi> the danger of the means as below us, and
ſo grow bold with the occaſions of iniquity, as pretending no
hazard or danger to us.</p>
                     <p>This may teach us a piece of Wiſdom,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> in the Imitation of the
Devil; we ſee his <hi>malice</hi> appears in the bloody and deſtructive
<hi>aims</hi> or intendments, which he diſcovers againſt us, but his <hi>skill</hi>
and cunning in a ſuitable <hi>diſpoſal</hi> and ordering of the <hi>Means.</hi> So
ſhould we learn to imploy all our <hi>care</hi> and watchfulneſs about thoſe
<hi>plauſible</hi> ways or <hi>introductions</hi> to Sin, that Satan puts in our hand;
and as his eager deſire of gaining his end, makes him induſtrious
about the offering of means fit to compaſs it, ſo our <hi>fear</hi> of his
Deſign and <hi>End</hi> ſhould make us <hi>jealous</hi> of every <hi>overture</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to us. They that from <hi>wilfulneſs</hi> or <hi>neglect</hi> ſhall admit the
<hi>means</hi> of Evil, cannot expect to avoid the <hi>Evil</hi> to which they lead,
or if they may (unexpectedly) be reſcued from the end, while
they uſe the Means (by Grace interpoſing, as between the Cup
and the Lip) 'tis no <hi>thanks</hi> to them, and often they come not off
ſo clear, but that ſome <hi>lameneſs</hi> or other ſticks by them.</p>
                     <p>I may ſuſpect this will be retorted back as an advice ſcarce <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> for if all means leading to Sin are to be avoided, then
can we uſe <hi>nothing,</hi> but rather (as the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe)
<hi>we muſt go out of the World,</hi> ſeeing every thing may lead to
evil.</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> We are not by any <hi>command</hi> of God put into any ſuch
<hi>ſtrait,</hi> things that are or may be <hi>improvable</hi> againſt us, may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by us with due <hi>Care</hi> and Watchfulneſs; yet all things are not
alike neither, for we muſt look upon things under a <hi>threefold</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If that which is propounded or laid before us, as a means
to Sin, be <hi>in it ſelf</hi> ſinful, the <hi>refuſal</hi> of both is an undoubted
<hi>Duty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, We muſt look upon thins under the conſideration
of the <hi>ſuſpiciouſneſs</hi> which they carry with them of a further evil;
ſome <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> or <hi>poſtures</hi> of an opportunity and occaſion
offered, are of ſuch a <hi>threatning Aſpect,</hi> that they fairly warn us to
hold off. To keep <hi>company</hi> with a Friend may be admitted, when
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49412:251"/>
yet that Society in a <hi>ſuſpitious place,</hi> as <hi>Tavern,</hi> or <hi>Whore-houſe,</hi> is
to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, We muſt further conſider things as we are <hi>free,</hi> or
<hi>engaged</hi> to them, and accordingly where there is <hi>appearance</hi> of
danger, or the <hi>fear</hi> of it, we muſt keep at a diſtance, if we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to ſuch things either by the obligation of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi>
or <hi>lawful Calling,</hi> or <hi>command of God,</hi> or <hi>unavoidable Providence,</hi> or
<hi>Relation,</hi> where theſe Ties are upon us, we cannot avoid the
thing or action, but are the more concerned to take heed of being
<hi>overreached</hi> or overtaken by them.</p>

                     <p>I Have particularly inſiſted upon the <hi>aims</hi> of Satan in this

and coherences of them: I have alſo ſingled out his <hi>chief</hi> deſign.
I am now in the laſt place to preſent you with the <hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> and
reſpects that the <hi>ſubordinate</hi> means carry to the <hi>Principal,</hi> and that
proportion which may be found in all theſe to the end deſigned
by them.</p>
                     <p>The chief <hi>means</hi> (in reference to the end deſigned) was a <hi>diſtruſt</hi> of
Providence; and the <hi>ſubordinate</hi> means to bring on that diſtruſt, was
the <hi>failure</hi> of ordinary means of ſupply: for ſo he endeavoured to
improve his hunger, and want in the Wilderneſs, as a manifeſt
neglect of Providence towards him, for which (as he tacitly ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts)
there was no ground to wait or rely upon it any further, but
to betake himſelf to another courſe. Hence Note,</p>
                     <p>That the failure of ordinary means of help,<note place="margin">Obſ. 13.</note> is by Satan improved as
his ſpecial Engine to bring Men to a diſtruſt of Providence, and from
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49412:252"/>
thence to an unwarrantable attempt for their relief in an extraordinary
way.</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>failure</hi> of <hi>ordinary</hi> and uſual ſupplies hath by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
ſubtilty brought a <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> of Providence, and run Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all <hi>hopes</hi> of help, is a thing commonly and notoriouſly
known. When Men are afflicted, and brought unto unuſual
ſtraits, and the ordinary ways of relief are out of ſight, they are
ſoon tempted to diſtruſt God and Man, and to conclude they are

3.</hi> 18. And from the Scriptures mentioned, we may alſo ſee the
ſtrength and prevalency of the Temptation, eſpecially when 'tis
reduced to particulars. As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, 'Tis not a thing altogether of no weight that ſuch a
Temptation ſhould prevail againſt <hi>ſuch</hi> Perſons, as <hi>David,</hi> and
<hi>Jonah,</hi> and the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the manifold <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi>
that ſome of them have had of Gods <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and the <hi>ſeaſonableneſs</hi> of help at times of greateſt hazard, the
particular <hi>promiſes</hi> that all of them have had, (how diſmal
and black ſoever things have ſeemed) have given the fulleſt
<hi>Aſſurances</hi> imaginable, that what he had ſpoken ſhould certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be performed; the gracious <hi>Qualifications</hi> of ſuch Perſons as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently
<hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>skilled</hi> in the Duties of Truſt, and in the <hi>Ways</hi>
of Providence, and the ſpecial <hi>Advantage</hi> which ſome of them (as
Prophets) have had above others, to enable them to improve
that <hi>Skill, Experience, Knowledg,</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> to a firm <hi>adherence</hi>
to ſuch ſpecial <hi>Promiſes,</hi> that all theſe things ſhould not be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to keep them off diſtruſt, (though at preſent the ways of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
were hid from them) ſeems ſtrange.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, 'Tis alſo wonderful to what an <hi>height</hi> ſuch a prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Temptation hath carryed ſome of them; <hi>David</hi> ſeems to be a
little outragious, and did upon the matter <hi>call God a Lyer,</hi> when
he ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 11. <hi>Pool</hi> Synopſis in loe.</note> 
                        <hi>all Men are Lyers,</hi> which (however that ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret,

<hi>avouchment</hi> of his Enemies <hi>Prognoſtications</hi> of his ruine, to be but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49412:252"/>
Lyes, and that this he ſpake from his firm belief of the Promiſe,
<hi>I believed, therefore have I ſpoken)</hi> yet the acknowledgment of his
<hi>haſte,</hi> (which (compared with <hi>Pſal. 31. 22.)</hi> is declared as his
<hi>weakneſs)</hi> will force us to conclude it an ingenuous <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of
his <hi>diſtruſt</hi> at the <hi>firſt:</hi> when he was greatly afflicted, (though he
recovered himſelf afterwards to a belief of the promiſe) and that in
that Diſtemper he plainly <hi>reflected</hi> upon <hi>Samuel,</hi> and calls the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of God given by him, <hi>a very Lye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, 'Tis ſtrange alſo, that preſent <hi>Inſtances</hi> of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
working out <hi>unexpected Deliverances</hi> ſhould not relieve the
hearts of his Saints from the power of ſuch diſtruſt, that when
they ſee God is not unmindful of them, but doth hear them in
what they feared, they ſhould ſtill retain in their minds the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of an unbelieving apprehenſion; and not rather free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from their expectations of future ruine, by concluding, that

this thought in his heart, that he ſhould <hi>one day periſh by the hand of
Saul,</hi> even then when God had ſo remarkably <hi>reſcued</hi> him from
<hi>Saul,</hi> and forced <hi>Saul</hi> not only to acknowledg his Sin in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
him, but alſo to declare his belief of the Promiſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>David.</hi>

                           <hi>See</hi> Cap. 26.</note> One would have expected, that this ſhould have been
ſuch a <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of the Truth of what had been promiſed, that
he ſhould have caſt out all <hi>fear;</hi> and yet contrariwiſe, this pledg
of God's purpoſe to him, is received by a heart ſtrongly <hi>prepoſſeſſed</hi>
with miſgiving thoughts, and he continues to think, that <hi>for all
this, Saul</hi> would one day deſtroy him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The <hi>pangs</hi> of this Diſtruſt are alſo ſo <hi>remarkable,</hi> that
after they have been delivered, and have found that the <hi>Event</hi> hath
not anſwered their <hi>fears,</hi> they have in the review of their carriage
under ſuch fears, recounted this their <hi>weakneſs</hi> among other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
things, thereby ſhewing the <hi>unreaſonableneſs</hi> of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
and their <hi>wonder</hi> that God ſhould paſs by ſo great a Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and notwithſtanding ſo unexpectedly deliver them. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
in the places before cited, was upon a thankful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God's Love and wonderful Kindneſs, which he thought
he could not perform, without leaving a record of his ſtrange and
unworthy diſtruſt; as if he had ſaid, <hi>So greatly did I ſin, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitably
did I behave my ſelf, that I then gave off, and concluded all
was loſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:49412:253"/>
To open this a little further, I ſhall add the Reaſons why Satan
ſtrikes in with ſuch an occaſion as the want of means, to tempt to
diſtruſt, which are theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Such a condition doth uſually <hi>tranſport</hi> Men beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
puts them as it were into an <hi>Extacy,</hi> and by a ſudden <hi>rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of of Aſtoniſhment and Fear, forceth them beyond their <hi>ſettled</hi>
thoughts and purpoſes. This <hi>David</hi> notes as the ground of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate
raſh ſpeaking; <hi>It was my haſte,</hi> I was tranſported, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Now as Paſſion doth not only make Men <hi>ſpeak</hi> what otherwiſe
they would not, but alſo to put bad <hi>Interpretations</hi> upon actions
and things beyond what they will <hi>bear,</hi> and <hi>haſten</hi> Men to <hi>Reſolves</hi>
exceedingly unreaſonable: So doth this ſtate of the Heart (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an amazement and ſurprize of Fear) give opportunity to
Satan to put Men to <hi>injurious</hi> and unrighteous thoughts of the
Providence of God, and by ſuch ways to alienate their Minds
from the truſt which they owe him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Senſe</hi> is a great <hi>help</hi> to Faith. Faith then muſt needs
be much hazarded, when Senſe is at a loſs, or contradicted, as
uſually it is, in ſtraits.</p>
                     <p>That Faith doth receive an <hi>advantage</hi> by Senſe, cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
To believe what we <hi>ſee,</hi> is <hi>eaſier</hi> than to believe what we <hi>ſee
not;</hi> and that in our ſtate of Weakneſs and Infirmity, God doth
ſo far <hi>indulge</hi> us, that by his allowance we may take the <hi>help</hi> of
our Senſes, is evident by his appointment of the <hi>two Sacraments,</hi>
where by <hi>outward viſible Signs</hi> our <hi>Faith</hi> may be quickned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the <hi>Spiritual benefits</hi> offered. <hi>Thomas,</hi> reſolving to ſuſpend
his belief till he were ſatisfied that Chriſt was riſen, by the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
tryal that Senſe could give, (determining not to credit the
Teſtimony of the reſt of the Diſciples, till by putting his <hi>Finger</hi> into
his Side he had made himſelf more <hi>certain)</hi> Chriſt not only <hi>conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended</hi>
to him, but alſo pronounceth his <hi>approbation</hi> of his belief,
<hi>accepting</hi> it, that he had <hi>believed</hi> becauſe he had <hi>ſeen.</hi> But when
outward uſual helps fail us, our <hi>Senſe</hi> (being not able to ſee afar
off) is wholly <hi>puzled</hi> and overthrown, the very <hi>diſappearing</hi> of
probabilities gives ſo great a <hi>ſhake</hi> to our Faith, that it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtaggers at it; and therefore was it given as the great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, that he (notwithſtanding the unlikely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of the thing) <hi>ſtaggered not at the Promiſe;</hi> noting thereby how
<hi>extraordinary</hi> it was in him at that time, to keep up againſt the
<hi>contradiction</hi> of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and how uſual it is with others to be beaten
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49412:253"/>
off all Truſt by it. 'Tis no wonder to ſee that <hi>Faith</hi> (which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
called Senſe for a <hi>Supporter)</hi> to <hi>fail</hi> when tis deprived of its
<hi>Crutch.</hi> And he that would a little underſtand what <hi>diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi>
this might prove to a good Man, when Senſe <hi>altogether fails</hi>
his expectation, he may conſider with himſelf in what a caſe
<hi>Thomas</hi> might have been, if Chriſt had <hi>refuſed</hi> to let him <hi>ſee</hi> his
Side, and to <hi>thruſt</hi> his Finger into the print of the Nails, in all
<hi>appearance</hi> had it been ſo, he had gone away <hi>confirmed</hi> in his
<hi>unbelief.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Though Faith can act <hi>above</hi> Senſe, and is imployed
about things <hi>not ſeen,</hi> yet <hi>every</hi> Saint at <hi>all</hi> times doth not act his
Faith ſo <hi>high.</hi> Chriſt tells us, that to believe where a Man hath not
had the help of <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Senſe,</hi> is <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Bleſſed. Joh.</hi> 20. 29.
yet withal, he hints it to be rare and difficult; <hi>he that hath not ſeen,
and yet hath believed,</hi> implyes, that 'tis but <hi>one</hi> amongſt many that
doth ſo, and that 'tis the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> of a more than ordinary <hi>difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
Hence it is, that to <hi>love</hi> God when he <hi>kills,</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> when
means <hi>fail,</hi> are reckoned among the <hi>high</hi> actings of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When Senſe is <hi>non-pluſt,</hi> and Faith fails, the Soul
of Man is at a great <hi>loſs:</hi> having nothing to <hi>bear</hi> it up, it muſt
needs <hi>ſink;</hi> but having ſomething to throw it <hi>down,</hi> beſides its
own <hi>propenſity</hi> downward to diſtruſt, it hath the force of ſo great
a <hi>diſappointment</hi> to puſh it forward; and ſuch <hi>bitterneſs</hi> of Spirit
heightned by the <hi>malignant</hi> Influence of Satan, that with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
(like the <hi>Angels</hi> throwing a <hi>Milſtone</hi> into the Sea) it is caſt
into the bottom of ſuch <hi>depths</hi> of unbelief, that the <hi>knowledg</hi> of
former Power and extraordinary Providences cannot keep it from
an abſolute denyal of the like for the future. <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
when they came to the want of Bread, though they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
he <hi>clave</hi> the <hi>Rock,</hi> and gave them Water in the like
ſtrait, yet ſo far did their Hearts <hi>fail</hi> of that due Truſt in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Mercy of God, which might have been expected; that
though they <hi>confeſſed</hi> the one, they as diſtruſtfully <hi>queſtion,</hi> and
deny the other. <hi>He clave the Rock, but can he provide Fleſh? can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e
give Bread?</hi> Strange unbelief! that <hi>ſees</hi> and acknowledgeth Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
in <hi>one</hi> thing, and yet <hi>denies</hi> it in <hi>another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Providence</hi> hath been an old <hi>Queſtion;</hi> 'tis an <hi>Atheiſm</hi>
that ſome have been guilty of, to deny that God <hi>ordereth</hi> all affairs
relating to his Children here below, who yet have not ſo fully
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49412:254"/>
                        <hi>extinguiſhed</hi> their <hi>natural Impreſſions,</hi> as to dare to deny the <hi>being</hi> of
God. <hi>That God is,</hi> they confeſs, but withal they think <hi>that he
walketh in the Circuit of Heaven,</hi> and as to the <hi>ſmaller</hi> concerns of
Men, neither doth <hi>good nor evil.</hi> This being an <hi>old Error,</hi> to which
moſt are but too <hi>inclinable,</hi> (and the more, becauſe ſuch things are
permitted (as the puniſhment of his Children, and their Tryals,
(while others have all their heart can wiſh) as ſeem ſcarce conſiſtent
with that love and care, which Men look for from him to his
Servants) they are apt enough to <hi>renew</hi> the thoughts of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
upon their Minds (for which the failure of ordinary ways
of help, ſeems to be an high probability) that he keeps himſelf
<hi>unconcerned,</hi> and therefore there ſeems to be no ſuch <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
upon him. The Pſalmiſt ſo expreſſeth that Truth, <hi>[Men
ſhall ſay, Verily there is a God that judgeth in the Earth,]</hi> that it is
diſcovered to be a ſpecial <hi>retrivement</hi> of it, (by many and ſignal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Evidences) from that <hi>diſtruſt</hi> of God, and his Providences
that Men uſually <hi>ſlide</hi> into upon their <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the many
ſeeming <hi>failures</hi> of outward means of help.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The other <hi>Branch</hi> of the Obſervation, <hi>That from a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
of Providence, he endeavours to draw them to an unwarrantable
attempt for their relief,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 16. 2.</note> is as clear as the former. <hi>Sarai</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a diſtruſt of the promiſe for a Son, becauſe of her Age, gave
her Hand-maid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in that way (the Promiſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to fail) ſhe might obtain Children by her. <hi>David</hi> becauſe of
the many and violent purſuits of <hi>Saul,</hi> not only <hi>diſtruſted</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
thinking he might <hi>one day periſh</hi> by him, but reſolves to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide</hi>
for his own ſafety,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 27. 1.</note> by a ſpeedy <hi>eſcape</hi> into the Land of the
<hi>Philiſtines;</hi> a <hi>courſe</hi> which (as appears by the Temptations and
evils he met with there) was altogether <hi>unwarrantable.</hi> That
from a diſtruſt, Men are next put upon unwarrantable Attempts,
is clear from the following Reaſons:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>affrightment</hi> which is bred by ſuch diſtruſts of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
will not ſuffer Men to be <hi>idle.</hi> Fear is <hi>active,</hi> and ſtrongly
<hi>prompts</hi> that ſomething is to be <hi>done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Yet ſuch is the <hi>confuſion</hi> of Mens minds in ſuch a caſe,
that though many things are propounded, in that hurry of thoughts
they are <hi>deprived</hi> uſually of a true <hi>Judgment</hi> and deliberation, ſo
that they are oppreſſed with a multitude of thoughts (as <hi>David</hi>
on the like occaſion takes notice, <hi>in the Multitude of my thoughts
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49412:254"/>
within me,</hi> &amp;c.) and (as he expreſſeth the caſe of Sea-men in a
Storm) they are at their wits end.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The <hi>deſparing</hi> grievance of Spirit, makes them take
that which comes <hi>next to hand;</hi> as a <hi>drowning</hi> Man, that <hi>graſps</hi> a
Twig or <hi>Straw,</hi> though to no purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Being once turned off their <hi>Rock,</hi> and the true <hi>ſtay</hi> of
the Promiſe of God for help, whatever other <hi>courſe</hi> they take muſt
needs be <hi>unwarrantable;</hi> If they once be out of the <hi>right</hi> way, they
muſt needs <hi>wander,</hi> and every <hi>ſtep</hi> they take, muſt of neceſſity be
<hi>wrong.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Satan is ſo <hi>Officious</hi> in an evil thing, that ſeeing any in
this condition, he will not fail to <hi>proffer</hi> his help, and in place of
Gods Providence, to ſet ſome <hi>unlawful Shift</hi> before them.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, And ſo much the rather do Men <hi>cloſe</hi> in with ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures,
becauſe a ſudden fit of paſſionate fury doth <hi>drive</hi> them,
and out of a bitter kind of <hi>deſpite</hi> and <hi>croſſneſs,</hi> (as if they medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a revenge againſt God for their diſappointment) they take up
an <hi>haſty</hi> wilful <hi>reſolve</hi> to go that way that ſeems moſt agreeable to
their <hi>paſſion,</hi> ſaying with King <hi>Joram, What wait we upon the Lord
any longer for?</hi> We will take ſuch a courſe, let come on us what
will.</p>
                     <p>The Service which the Obſervation (well digeſted) may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
for us,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> is very fully contained in an advice which <hi>David</hi> gives
on the like occaſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 34. which is this, <hi>Wait on the Lord,
and keep his way.</hi> Failures of ordinary means ſhould not fill us
with diſtruſt, neither then ſhould we run out of God's way for
help. He that would practiſe this, muſt have theſe <hi>three</hi> things
which are comprehended in it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He muſt have <hi>full perſwaſions</hi> of the Power and Promiſe of
God. I do not mean, the bare <hi>hear-ſay,</hi> that God hath <hi>promiſed</hi>
to help, and that he is <hi>able</hi> to deliver, but theſe Truths muſt be
<hi>wrought</hi> upon the heart to a <hi>full Aſſurance</hi> of them, and then we
muſt <hi>keep our Eye</hi> upon them: for if ever we loſe the <hi>Sight</hi> of this,
when troubles beſet us, our Heart will <hi>fail</hi> us, and we ſhall do no
otherwiſe than <hi>Hagar,</hi> who, when her Bottle of Water was ſpent,
and ſhe ſaw no way of ſupply, ſate down, gave up her Son, and
ſelf for loſt, and ſo falls a weeping over her helpleſs condition.
This was that <hi>Sight</hi> of God (in regard of his Power,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 27.</note> Goodneſs,
Faithfulneſs, and Truth, which are things <hi>Inviſible,)</hi> which kept
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49412:255"/>
up the Heart of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that it ſunk not under the preſſure of his
fears, when all things threatned his ruine.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He that would thus wait upon God, had need to
have an <hi>equal Ballance</hi> of Spirit, in reference to <hi>ſecond cauſes; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe</hi>
or Neglect them he may not, when he <hi>may have</hi> them, for
that were intollerable <hi>preſumption,</hi> and ſo to <hi>center</hi> our Hopes and
Expectations upon them, as if our <hi>welfare</hi> did certainly <hi>depend</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, is an high <hi>affront</hi> to Gods <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> and no leſs than
a ſinful <hi>idolizing</hi> of the Creature; but the engagements of our <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
muſt keep carefully to the <hi>firſt,</hi> and the conſideration of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency</hi>
of an <hi>Almighty</hi> Power, as to any <hi>ſubordinate</hi> means or
cauſes, muſt help us againſt the <hi>other</hi> miſcarriage. When all
means <hi>viſible</hi> fail us, we muſt look to live upon Omnipotent
<hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> and Goodneſs, which is not tyed to any thing, but
that <hi>without</hi> all means, and <hi>contrary</hi> to the Powers of <hi>ſecond Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
can do what he hath promiſed, or ſees fit.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is no waiting upon God and keeping his way,
without a <hi>particular truſt</hi> in God, to this we are not only <hi>warranted</hi>
by frequent <hi>Commands, Truſt in the Lord,</hi> I ſay, <hi>Truſt in the Lord;</hi>
but highly <hi>encouraged</hi> to it, under the greateſt Aſſurances of help.
<hi>Pſal. 37. 5. Truſt in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſs. Truſt in the
Lord and do Good, and verily thou ſhalt be fed. ver.</hi> 3. The Lord
ſhall help and deliver them, becauſe they <hi>truſt</hi> in him. And this
we are to do at <hi>all times,</hi> and in the <hi>greateſt Hazards,</hi> and with the
<hi>higheſt Security.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 3. 5, 6.</note> 
                        <hi>I laid me down and ſlept, I will not be affraid of
ten thouſands of People, that have ſet themſelves againſt me round
about.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſome (poſſibly) may ſay,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Is it our Duty to <hi>ſit ſtill</hi> in ſuch a
caſe? when all the uſual ways of ſupply fail us, muſt nothing be
attempted?</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> Firſt, At ſuch times greater <hi>Care</hi> and Diligence is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
in <hi>outward</hi> things; that what <hi>one</hi> lawful courſe <hi>cannot</hi> help,
<hi>another</hi> lawful <hi>courſe</hi> may; and as to <hi>ſpiritual Diligence,</hi> it ſhould be
<hi>extraordinary,</hi> we ſhould be more earneſt and frequent in Prayer,
Faſtings, Meditations, and the exerciſe of Graces.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, While we are in the purſuit of <hi>Duty,</hi> and where the
<hi>Subſtance</hi> of it may be preſerved <hi>entire,</hi> if our <hi>Straits</hi> and Wants
<hi>unavoidably</hi> put us <hi>out of the way,</hi> we may be ſatisfyed to <hi>go on,</hi>
though ſome <hi>Circumſtances</hi> be neceſſarily <hi>waved</hi> and hindred. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
might kill <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi</hi> upon the Command of <hi>Moſes.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49412:255"/>
Numb.</hi> 25. 5. And conſequently in Proſecution of Duty, though
(other Circumſtances conſidered) it was in ſome reſpects extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, But let the <hi>Strait</hi> be what it will, we muſt not forſake
Duty; for ſo we go <hi>out</hi> of Gods way, and do contradict that Truſt
and Hope which we are to keep up to God-ward.</p>
                     <p>But (it may be further urged) muſt we when all Means fail,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
                        <hi>poſitively</hi> Truſt in God for thoſe <hi>very</hi> things which we might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
in an ordinary way?</p>
                     <p>In ſome caſes,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> our Duty is <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to his Will, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Mercy neither <hi>poſitively</hi> to be <hi>expected,</hi> nor yet <hi>diſtruſted.</hi>
Thus did <hi>David</hi> behave himſelf, when he fled from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Abſolom</hi>'s Rebellion; <hi>Let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But there are other Caſes wherein 'tis our Duty to <hi>ſix</hi> our Truſt
upon the <hi>particular</hi> Mercy or help. I ſhall name <hi>four,</hi> and poſſibly
a great many more may be added. As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When Mercies are <hi>expreſly</hi> and particularly <hi>promiſed;</hi> as
when the Kingdom was promiſed to <hi>David.</hi> When a Son was
promiſed to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Whatever had been the <hi>Improbabilities</hi> of
their obtaining the thing promiſed, it was their duty <hi>poſitively</hi> to
believe. This is indeed not a general Caſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When God leads us into ſtraits by <hi>engaging</hi> us in his
<hi>Service,</hi> as when <hi>Iſrael</hi> followed the Lord into the Wilderneſs, in
order to an enjoyment of a further Mercy, which was the Poſſeſſion
of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> when they had no Water to drink, nor
Food to eat, and ſaw no <hi>natural</hi> poſſibility of ſupply in that Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
they ought poſitively to have expected ſupplies from God
in an <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Way, and it is reckoned up againſt them as
their Sin that they did not believe. This was the very caſe of
Chriſt under this Temptation, the Spirit led him into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
upon the proſecution of a further deſign; when there was
no Bread there to ſatisfy his Hunger, he <hi>refuſeth</hi> to work a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
for his ſupply, but leans upon an <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When the things we want are <hi>common univerſal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi>
and ſuch as we cannot <hi>ſubſiſt</hi> without: if we have <hi>nothing</hi> to
<hi>eat,</hi> and <hi>nothing</hi> to <hi>put on,</hi> yet ſeeing the <hi>Body</hi> cannot <hi>live</hi> without
both, we muſt <hi>poſitively</hi> expect ſuch ſupplies from Providence,
though we ſee not the Way whence they ſhould ariſe to us. This
kind of Diſtruſt (which reflects upon the general neceſſary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49412:256"/>
of God, by which he is engaged to preſerve his Creatures in
their Stations,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>To cloath the Graſs of the Field, to feed the Birds of
the Air,</hi> &amp;c.) Chriſt doth ſeverely challenge, <hi>Shall he not much
more cloath you, O ye of little Faith?</hi> He hath little or no Faith,
(and in that regard a very <hi>Prodigy</hi> of Diſtruſt) that will not believe
for Neceſſaries. Hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 17. the Prophet reſolves upon a
rejoycing Confidence in God, when neither <hi>Tree,</hi> nor <hi>Field,</hi> nor
<hi>Flock</hi> would yeild any <hi>hope</hi> in an ordinary way.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When God is <hi>eminently engaged</hi> for our help, and his
Honour lies at Stake in that very matter; ſo that whether God <hi>will</hi>
help or no, or whether he is <hi>able,</hi> is become the <hi>Controverſy,</hi> upon
which <hi>Religion</hi> in its Truth, or the <hi>Honour</hi> of God is to be tryed;
then are we engaged to a <hi>certain</hi> belief of help. The three <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
upon this ground did not only aſſert, that <hi>God was able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them,</hi> or that their Death and Martyrdome they could <hi>bear</hi>
(which is all that moſt Martyrs are able to ariſe up to) but they
aſſerted poſſitively, that <hi>God would deliver them,</hi> and that the Fire
ſhould not burn them: they ſaw evidently that the Conteſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Lord</hi> was <hi>God,</hi> was managed at ſo high a rate, that God
was more concerned to <hi>Vindicate</hi> his <hi>Honour</hi> by their preſervation,
than to <hi>Vindicate</hi> their <hi>Grace</hi> and Patience by their Conſtancy in
<hi>Suffering.</hi> Another Inſtance we have in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 26. where
Chriſt rebukes his Diſciples for unbelief, in their fears of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
in a great Storm (not that every Sea-man <hi>ordinarily</hi> lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that charge, that gives himſelf up to the apprehenſions of
Danger:) the ground of which charge was this, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was
<hi>with</hi> them, and conſequently it had unavoidably <hi>contradicted</hi> his
Deſign, and <hi>reflected</hi> upon his Honour, if he had ſuffered his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
at <hi>that time</hi> to be drowned: their not minding how far Chriſt
was engaged with them, and not ſupporting themſelves againſt
their Fears by that Conſideration, made Chriſt tax them for their
<hi>little Faith.</hi>

<hi>End;</hi> he had (as we have ſeen) fitly proportioned the <hi>ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi>
Means to the <hi>chief</hi> and principal. The failure of ordinary
Means of help, was ſhrewdly proper to infer a Diſtruſt of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Now let it be noted how fitly he improves this <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> of
<hi>Providence,</hi> to bring about the End he aimed at, which was a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt</hi>
of his <hi>Filial</hi> Intereſt in God, as if he ſhould have thus reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
<hi>He that in ſtraits is forſaken, as to all the uſual ſupplies that may
be expected in an ordinary way, hath no reaſon to relyon Providence; and
he that hath no reaſon to rely on Providence for the Body, hath leſs cauſe
to expect Spiritual Bleſſings and Favours for the Soul.</hi> Hence
note,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That 'tis Satan's endeavour,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>to make Men proceed from a Diſtruſt of
Providence, to a Diſtruſt of their Spiritual Sonſhip, or Filial Intereſt in
God.</hi> Firſt, I ſhall evidence that this is Satan's Deſign, and next,
I ſhall give the Reaſons of it. The former I ſhall make good by theſe
ſeveral Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, We ſee it is an <hi>uſual</hi> Inference that others make of Men
whoſe Heart fails them, under an abſence or diſappearance of all
means of help in their Diſtreſſes. If Providence doth not <hi>appear</hi>
for them, they conclude God hath <hi>forſaken</hi> them. <hi>Bildad</hi> thus
concludes againſt <hi>Job chap. 4. 6. Is not this thy fear, thy Confidence, thy
Hope, and the uprightneſs of thy ways?</hi> Which muſt not only be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
as an <hi>Ironical</hi> Scoſſ at the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of his Confidence and
Hope, as not being able to ſupport him againſt fainting in his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49412:257"/>
trouble, but as a direct <hi>accuſation</hi> of the <hi>falſeneſs</hi> and Hypocriſy of
his ſuppoſed Integrity, and all the Hopes and Confidence which
was built upon it; and <hi>ver.</hi> 7. doth evidence, where he plainly
declares himſelf to mean, that <hi>Job</hi> could not be Innocent or
Righteous, it being (in his apprehenſion) a thing never heard
of, that ſo great Calamities ſhould overtake an upright Man;
<hi>Whoever periſhed being Innocent?</hi> The ground of which aſſertion was
from <hi>ver. 5. It is now come upon thee, and thou fainteſt.</hi> That is,
Diſtreſſes are upon thee, and thou haſt no viſible means of help,
but deſpaireſt ever to ſee a Providence that will bring thee out;
therefore furely thou haſt had no real Intereſt in God, as his
Child. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> alſo ſeconds his Friend in this uncharitable
Cenſure; <hi>If thou wert pure and upright, he would awake for thee;</hi>
that is,<note place="margin">Job 8. 6.</note> becauſe he doth thus overlook thee, therefore thou art not
pure and upright.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Men</hi> do thus aſſault the Comforts of God's Children, we have
reaſon enough to think that <hi>Satan</hi> will; for beſides that we may
conclude they are ſet on work by the Devil, (and what he ſpeaks
by them, he will alſo by other ways promote, as being a deſign that
is upon his Heart;) we may be confident, that this being a <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi>
ſo <hi>Natural</hi> to the Heart of Man, he will not let ſlip ſo fair an
advantage, for the forming of it in our own Hearts againſt our
ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The beſt of Gods Children, in ſuch caſes, eſcape it
very <hi>hardly</hi> (if at all;) which declares, not only the depth and
Power of that Policy, but alſo how uſual it is with Satan to urge
the Servants of God with it. <hi>Job, chap.</hi> 19. 25. recovered himſelf
to a firm perſwaſion of Sonſhip, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</hi> &amp;c.
but by the way his <hi>Foot had well-nigh ſlipt,</hi> when <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. he
cryes out, <hi>He hath deſtroyed me on ever ſide, and I am gone; he hath
alſo kindled his Wrath againſt me, and he counteth me unto him as one of
his Enemies.</hi> His <hi>earneſt reſolve,</hi> not to give up his Truſt in God,
and the <hi>Confidence</hi> of his Integrity, is ſufficient to diſcover Satans
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ager <hi>Indeavours</hi> to have him bereaved of it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Satans <hi>Succeſs</hi> in this Temptation over the Saints of
God, (who ſometime have actually failed;) ſhews how much it
is his work to caſt down their hopes of Intereſt in God, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
their Truſt in his Providences. If he attempts this,
(and that ſucceſsfully;) on <hi>ſuch</hi> whoſe frequent Experiences
might <hi>diſcourage</hi> the Tempter, and in probability <hi>fruſtrate</hi> his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49412:257"/>
undertaking; We have little cauſe to think, that he will be more
<hi>ſparing</hi> and gentle in this Aſſault upon thoſe that are more <hi>weak,</hi>
and leſs acquainted with thoſe <hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>Darkneſses,</hi> that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow
the ways of Providence. <hi>David,</hi> for all the Promiſes that
he had received, and notwithſtanding the manifold tryals that he
had of ſeaſonable and unexpected deliverances, yet when he was
<hi>diſtreſſed,</hi> he once and again falls into a fear of his <hi>Soul,</hi> and a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning
of God's Favour. He complains as one utterly forſaken,
<hi>Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 1.</note> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. He expreſſeth himſelf,
<hi>ver. 1. ſinking in the deep Mire,</hi> as a Man that had no firm ground
to ſtand upon, and that his troubles had brought him to fear the
ſtate of his Soul, not only as <hi>deprived</hi> of God's Favour (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>ver.</hi> 17. begs that his <hi>Face</hi> may be no longer <hi>hid)</hi> but alſo as
ſuſpecting the <hi>loſs</hi> of it, <hi>ver. 18. draw nigh unto my Soul, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
it, Pſal.</hi> 77. upon the occaſion of <hi>outward</hi> Troubles. <hi>Aſaph</hi>
falls into ſuch a fit of fear, about his Spiritual Condition, that no
conſideration of former Mercies could relieve him, <hi>He remembred
God. ver.</hi> 3. but <hi>was troubled;</hi> he <hi>conſidered the days of old, called to
remembrance his Songs in the Night.</hi> But none of theſe were effectual
to keep him from that ſad outcry of Diſtruſt, <hi>ver. 7. Will the Lord
caſt off for ever? is his Mercy clean gone for ever? hath God forgotten to
be Gracious?</hi> &amp;c. Which upon the review, in the compoſing of
the Pſalm, he acknowledgeth an unbelieving miſcarriage; I ſaid,
<hi>this is mine infirmity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, 'Tis alſo a common and ordinary thing with moſt,
to entertain <hi>miſapprehenſions</hi> of their Spiritual Condition, when
they meet with <hi>diſappointments</hi> of Providence: Hence the Apoſtle,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5, 6. when he would quiet the Hearts of Men under the
Lords Chaſtening, doth of purpoſe make uſe of this encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that God <hi>ſpeaks</hi> to them in the Rod, as to <hi>Children,</hi> and ſuch
as are under his Care and Love; <hi>My Son deſpiſe not the Chaſtening of
the Lord: whom the Lord loveth, he chaſtneth,</hi> &amp;c. Which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tells us thus much, that 'tis ordinary for Men to doubt their
<hi>Son-ſhip</hi> becauſe of their <hi>Afflictions.</hi> We may conjecture what the
<hi>Malady</hi> is, when we know what is prepared as a <hi>Medicine:</hi> This
would not have been a common Remedy, <hi>(that we may be Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
though we be ſcourged)</hi> if the disbelief of this, had not
been the uſual interpretation of Afflictions, and a common Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:49412:258"/>
Fifthly, We may further take notice, that thoſe <hi>diſquiets</hi> of
Mind, that were only occaſioned by <hi>outward</hi> things, and ſeem
to have no <hi>Affinity</hi> (either in the nature of the occaſion, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Inclination of the Party) with a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Trouble; yet if
they continue <hi>long,</hi> do wholly <hi>change</hi> their Nature; they that at
firſt only troubled themſelves, for loſſes or croſſes, forget theſe
Troubles, and take up fears for their Souls.</p>
                     <p>Sometime this ariſeth from a natural <hi>ſoftneſs</hi> and timerouſneſs of
Spirit, ſuch are apt to miſgive upon any occaſion, and to ſay, Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>If I were his Child, he would not thus forſake me; his fatherly
Compaſſions, would ſome way or other work towards me?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sometime this ariſeth from <hi>Melancholly contracted</hi> or heightned
by outward <hi>Troubles.</hi> Theſe when they continue long, and peirce
deep, put Men into a <hi>Spirit of heavineſs,</hi> which makes them refuſe
to be comforted. Here the Devil takes his advantage: <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful

themſelves, as being out of God's Favour, as being eſtranged from
God, as being of the number of the damned; ſuch againſt whom

If there be ſuch an <hi>Affinity</hi> betwixt diſtruſt of Providence, and
diſtruſt of Son-ſhip, that the one ſlides into the other naturally.
If this be <hi>common</hi> to all Men under troubles, to ſuſpect their
Souls; if the <hi>beſt</hi> do here actually miſcarry; if thoſe that do not
yet <hi>hardly</hi> eſcape; and if <hi>by-ſtanders</hi> commonly give this Judgment
of Men in ſtraits, that there is no help for them in their God; we
cannot but <hi>collect</hi> from all this, that it is an advantage which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
will not neglect, and that he doth very much imploy himſelf
to bring it about:</p>
                     <p>The Reaſons of it are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Diſtruſt of Providence hath in it the very <hi>formal</hi> nature of
diſtruſt of Son-ſhip. If the Object of diſtruſt were but changed,
it would without any further addition work that way.<note place="margin">Dr. Reynolds <hi>Serm. on</hi> Hoſea 14. <hi>Ser.</hi> 4.</note> He that
truſts Providence acknowledgeth that God <hi>knoweth</hi> his wants, that
he is of a <hi>merciful</hi> inclination to give what he ſees he hath need of;
that he hath manifeſted this by <hi>Promiſe,</hi> that he is ſo <hi>faithful</hi> that
this Promiſe cannot be neglected, and that he hath <hi>Power</hi> to do
what he hath promiſed. He that diſtruſts Providence <hi>disbelieves</hi>
all theſe, <hi>conſequentially</hi> at leaſt; and he that will not believe that
God takes any <hi>care</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> or that he is of a merciful diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
toward him, or thinks either he hath made no ſuch Promiſe,
or will not keep it, if any ſuch were made; cannot believe (if
that doubt were but once ſtarted) that God is his <hi>Father,</hi> or that
he hath intereſt in the Priviledg of a Son, <hi>Seeing it is impoſſible to
believe a Sonſhip, while his Care, Mercy, Promiſes, and Power are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted.</hi>
In this then Satans work is very eaſy, it is but his moving
the Queſtion about the Lords Mercy to the Soul, and preſently
(as when new Matter is miniſtred to a raging Flame;) it takes
hold upon it, and with equal, (nay greater) force it carries the
Soul to diſtruſt Spiritual Mercies, as before it disbelieved Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Kindneſſes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>ſame</hi> Reaſons, which any Man doth gather from
the ſeeming neglect or Oppoſition of Providence; upon which he
grounds his diſtruſt of the Lords Kindneſs in reference to <hi>outward</hi>
things, will alſo <hi>ſerve</hi> as Arguments for a diſtruſt of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
The diſtreſſes of Men ſeem to argue, (1.) That there is
<hi>Sin</hi> and Provocation on their part, (2.) And that there is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
of <hi>Anger</hi> on Gods part, (3.) And from theſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
ariſeth <hi>Bitterneſs,</hi> Anxiety, Fear, and Dejection of Spirit,
which <hi>intercepts</hi> all the Help and Conſolation which might ariſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49412:259"/>
from other <hi>conſiderations</hi> of the Lords <hi>Promiſe,</hi> or <hi>Mercy,</hi> for the
quieting of the Heart, and fortifying it againſt ſuch apprehenſions;
theſe ſame grounds, with the prevailing fears and perplexities,
ariſing from them, are enough to make us ſuſpect, that we are
not yet under any ſuch peculiar Favours, as may beſpeak us his
Children by Adoption; ſo that from the ſame premiſes Satan will
conclude, that as he hath no <hi>care</hi> for our <hi>Bodies,</hi> ſo no <hi>love</hi> to our
Souls; that we neither love God nor are beloved of him, betwixt
the one concluſion and the other there is but a <hi>ſtep,</hi> and with a
ſmall labour he can cut the Channel, and let in that very
Diſtruſt, to run with all its force againſt our Spiritual Intereſt in
God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To truſt God for the Soul is an <hi>higher</hi> act, than to
truſt him for the Body, the Soul being of greater <hi>excellency</hi> than
the Body; and the Mercy neceſſary for the happineſs of it, being
more <hi>precious,</hi> and <hi>leſs viſible,</hi> it muſt require an <hi>higher</hi> Confidence
in God, to aſſure of this, then ſatisfy us in the other; 'tis more
eaſy to believe a <hi>leſſer</hi> kindneſs from a Friend, than a ſingular or
<hi>extraordinary</hi> Favour; he then that cannot truſt God for <hi>temporal</hi>
Mercies, ſhall be more unable to believe <hi>Eternal</hi> Bleſſings; If we
run with <hi>Foot-men,</hi> and they have <hi>wearried</hi> us, ſhall we be able to
contend with <hi>Horſe-men?</hi> If the <hi>Shallow</hi> Brooks be too ſtrong for
us, what ſhall we do in the <hi>ſwellings</hi> of <hi>Jordan?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When Faith is weakned as to <hi>one</hi> Object, 'tis ſo <hi>tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
and diſcouraged, that it is generally weakned as to <hi>all</hi> other;
if the hand be ſo weakned that it cannot hold a Ring, it will be
leſs able to Graſp a Crown; when we are baffled in our truſt for
temporal Mercies, if Satan then put us to it not to believe for
ſpiritual Bleſſings, how can we expect but to be much more at a
loſs in them? So that he is ſure of the Victory before he Fights, and
he that is ſo ſedulous to take advantage againſt us, will not loſe
ſo conſiderable a Conqueſt for want of purſuit. There is indeed
one thing that may ſeem fit to be objected againſt this, which is,
that Men may retain their <hi>Faith</hi> in one thing, when yet they <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt</hi>
in another, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> diſtruſted the Power and Goodneſs
of God for <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Fleſh</hi> in the Wilderneſs, when yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that as he had given <hi>Water</hi> out of the Rock, ſo he could do
it again if there were need. <hi>Pſal. 78. 20. He ſmote the Rock, and
the Waters guſhed out, but can he give Bread:</hi> as if they had ſaid, we
believe he can give Water, but 'tis impoſſible he ſhould provide
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49412:259"/>
Bread. But they that would thus object, may conſider, that the reaſon
of Mens Confidence in one thing, (while diſtruſt is in other things
prevailing) is not from any real <hi>ſtrength</hi> of their Faith, but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>want</hi> of a Temptation; if ſuch a confidence were put to it,
it would quickly be ſeen that it were truly nothing. As confident
as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were, that they could believe for a ſupply of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we find, that neither that experience, nor the other of ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them with <hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>Quails</hi> were ſufficient to keep up their
truſt in God, but that at the next ſtrait all was to ſeek, <hi>verſe 32.
For all this they ſinned ſtill, and believed not for his wonderous
works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Beſides all the forementioned Advantages that Satan
hath in raiſing this Temptation, of diſtruſting Son-ſhip out of a
diſtruſt to Providence, we may ſuppoſe him the more earneſt in
this matter, becauſe 'tis ſo <hi>provoking</hi> to God to diſtruſt his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
that he often, (as a juſt chaſtiſement of that evil) pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
it; by giving them up to diſtruſt him for their Souls;
the height of the provocation may be meaſured by this, that 'tis
not only a <hi>denyal</hi> of God that is above, but uſually a <hi>veſting</hi> ſome
mean and contemptible thing, with thoſe Attributes which only
ſuit a God <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Eternal.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hoſea 14. 2, 3.</note> As <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not only forſake the
Almighty by their diſtruſt, but place their hopes upon <hi>Aſhur,</hi> upon
their own Horſes and Warlike Preparations, and at laſt, upon the
works of their hands, which they called their Gods. How offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
this is to the Lord, we may obſerve by that notable check
which the Prophet gave <hi>Ahaz. Eſay</hi> 7. 8, 13. notwithſtanding his
complement of refuſing a Sign, (which God offered him for the
ſtrengthning of his hope) upon a pretence that he would truſt
without it, (though indeed he abſolutely diſtruſted him, as appears
by 2 <hi>Chron. 28. 20.)</hi> that it was a <hi>weaning</hi> and tyring out the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of a long-ſuffering God; <hi>Is it a ſmall thing for you to weary
Men, but will you weary my God alſo?</hi> God is ſo active and jealous
of all <hi>incroachments</hi> of this kind, that they may expect he will <hi>give
up</hi> ſuch Offenders to be puniſhed by the terrors of an higher diſtruſt.
He that is not owned as a God in his Providences, will not be
owned as a Father for Spiritual Mercies; they that <hi>will</hi> not own
him for the Body, <hi>ſhall</hi> not be able to lay hold upon him or his
ſtrength, to be at peace with him for their Souls, and by this
piece of juſt diſcipline he often cures the diſtruſt of Providence in
his Children, who when they ſee themſelves plunged into terrors
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49412:260"/>
and fears about their everlaſting Welfare, do not only call God
Juſt, and accept of the puniſhment of their Iniquity, in diſtruſting
him for ſmaller matters, but now wiſh with all their hearts, that they
might have no greater thing to trouble them than what relates to
the Body, or this Life.</p>
                     <p>To Sum up all theſe reaſons in one word; Satan hath from the
forementioned conſiderations, a certain expectation of prevalency.
For not only in this caſe doth God (as it were) fight for him, by
<hi>giving them up,</hi> to diſtruſt their <hi>Filial</hi> Intereſt, that have <hi>provoked</hi>
him by a diſtruſt of Providence; and our Faith is alſo ſo <hi>weakned</hi>
by the former overthrow, that 'tis not able to maintain its ground
in an higher matter, but alſo this diſtruſt carries that in the <hi>nature</hi>
and <hi>grounds</hi> of it; that will of it ſelf work up to a disbelief of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Mercies. He knows then that this piece of the Victory is
an eaſy Conſequence of the former, and we may ſay of it, as the
Prophet <hi>Nahum, chap.</hi> 3. 12. of the Strong-holds of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> 'tis
like <hi>a Fig-tree with the firſt ripe Figs, if they be ſhaken, they ſhall even
fall into the mouth of the eater.</hi> This Temptation of diſtruſting our
Son-ſhip falls into Satans Mouth with a little Labour, when once
he hath prevailed ſo far, as to make us diſtruſt the Providence of
God in outward matters.</p>
                     <p>This muſt warn and caution us againſt any unbeſeeming unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving

are but too apt in our ſtraits to take a greater liberty to <hi>queſtion</hi> his
Mercy and Power, not foreſeeing how cloſely this borders upon a
greater evil; we may ſay of it, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>babling in
Controverſies,</hi> that they <hi>lead to more ungodlineſs,</hi> and that ſuch words
<hi>eat as a Canker,</hi> ſo doth this diſtruſt uſually carry us further, and
when we fall out with God for ſmall matters, he will be angry in
earneſt, and withdraw from us our Conſolations in greater. In
the depth of your diſtreſſes when your fears are round about you,
and God ſeems to compaſs you about with his Net; when Lover
and Friend forſakes, and when there is no appearance of help, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
(for the keeping hold of your Intereſt in God) to behave
your ſelves according to the following directions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Look upon the Providences of God to be as a great <hi>deep,</hi>
the bottom of whoſe ways and deſigns you cannot reach; think of
them as of a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> which indeed you muſt <hi>ſtudy,</hi> but not
<hi>throw</hi> away, becauſe you cannot at firſt underſtand it. Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are not to be dealt with as <hi>Alexander</hi> did by <hi>Gordius</hi> his knot,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49412:260"/>
who when he could not looſe it, he cut it. If you ſee not the
end of the Lord, or cannot meet with a door of hope in it, yet
<hi>lay your Hand upon your Mouth,</hi> ſpeak not, think not evil of
things, you know not, but wait till the time of their <hi>bringing forth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, You muſt keep up in your hearts <hi>high</hi> and honourable
<hi>thoughts</hi> of God, yea, of his Mercy and Goodneſs, and where you
cannot ſee your way, or God's way before you, yet (as it were by a
kind of <hi>implicit</hi> Faith) muſt you believe that he is <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Good</hi>
in all his ways.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Though you may read your <hi>Sins,</hi> or God's <hi>diſpleaſure</hi>
in them, and accordingly endeavour to humble your ſelves, and
call your ſelves vile, yet muſt it be always remembred, that <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Love</hi> or <hi>Hatred</hi> is not to be <hi>meaſured</hi> by them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Reſtrain complainings.</hi> 'Tis indeed an eaſe to complain;
<hi>I will ſpeak</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) that I may be refreſhed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 32. 20.</note> notwithſtanding a
<hi>vent</hi> being given, 'tis difficult to keep within <hi>bounds.</hi> Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings
<hi>entice</hi> us to diſtruſt, as may appear in <hi>Job,</hi> who took
a boldneſs this way, more than was fit; as <hi>Chap. 10. 3. Is it good
unto thee that thou ſhouldeſt oppreſs? and that thou ſhouldeſt deſpiſe the
work of thine hands?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All this hath been ſaid in the opening of the Temptation it ſelf,
now muſt I conſider the <hi>motive</hi> that Satan uſed to bring on the
Temptation by; <hi>If thou be the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Queſtion</hi> that is here moved by ſome, is, whether Satan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>knew,</hi> or truly <hi>doubted</hi> Chriſt to be the Son of God. Several
Learned Men think that he was in <hi>doubt,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Beza, Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius. Serm.</hi> de jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio &amp; tempt, Chriſti. Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas naturarum excaecavit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanam.</note> and the reaſons are
variouſly conjectured. <hi>Cyprian</hi> conceives that <hi>the unity of the two
Natures in one Perſon did blind him,</hi> he knew it to be impoſſible that
the Divine Nature ſhould hunger, and might think it ſtrange that
the Humane Nature ſhould faſt ſo long. <hi>Cornelius</hi> a <hi>Lapide</hi> thinks
that Satan <hi>knew</hi> that there ſhould be <hi>two Natures</hi> united in one
Perſon, and that this occaſioned Satans Fall, while he proudly
ſtomacked the exaltation of the Humane Nature, but he imagins
Satan's doubt aroſe from a <hi>doubtful Sence</hi> of that phraſe, <hi>This is my
beloved Son,</hi> as not knowing whether Chriſt were <hi>the Natural,</hi> or
an <hi>Adopted</hi> Son of God.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding theſe apprehenſions, others conceive that
Satan knew very well who Chriſt was, and that being privy to ſo
many things relating to him, as the <hi>Promiſes</hi> which went before
and directly pointed out the time, the <hi>Angels Salutation</hi> of <hi>Mary</hi>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:49412:261"/>
at his Conception, the <hi>Star</hi> that conducted the Wiſe Men to him,
the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> from Heaven concerning him, with a great many
things more, he could not poſſibly be ignorant that he was the
<hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the Son of God by Nature; Neither doth that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>If thou be the Son of God,</hi> imply any <hi>doubting,</hi> ſeeing that that
is uſually expreſſive of the greateſt <hi>certainty</hi> and aſſurance, as in
the ſpeech of <hi>Lamech, If Cain ſhall be avenged ſeven-fold,</hi> that is,
as certainly he ſhall be avenged; ſo Satan might uſe it to this Senſe,
<hi>If,</hi> or <hi>ſeeing thou art the Son of God.</hi> Now whereas it may ſeem
ſtrange, that he ſhould ſet upon Chriſt, if he knew who he was,
I have anſwered that before, and ſhall here only add, that though
Satan did believe Chriſt to be the Son of God, yet ſo ſtrongly did
the power of <hi>Malice</hi> work in him, that he would have had him
to have doubted that he was not ſo. From all this, we have this
Obſervation,</p>
                     <p>That the great deſign of Satan is to weaken the Aſſurance and Hopes
of the Children of God,<note place="margin">Obſ. 15.</note> in their Adoption.</p>
                     <p>This is the Maſter-piece of his deſign, the very Center in which
moſt of his Devices meet; we may ſay of him, as <hi>Eſau</hi> ſaid of
<hi>Jacob, is he not rightly called Jacob,</hi> a ſupplanter; he firſt ſtole away
our <hi>Birth-right</hi> at the <hi>Creation,</hi> and now he ſeeks to take away our
<hi>bleſſing</hi> in Chriſt the <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſons of this undertaking I ſhall not here inſiſt on; 'tis
ſufficiently obvious, that the greateſt perplexity and ſorrow ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to the Children of God from hence, and that a troop of other
Spiritual evils (as Impatience, Fury, Blaſphemy, and many more)
doth follow it at the Heels, beſides all that inability for Service,
and at laſt, plain neglect of all Duty. All I ſhall further do at this
time, ſhall be to ſhew in a few particulars, (from Satans carriage
to Chriſt in this Temptation) how and after what manner he doth
manage that deſign, in which note.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That 'tis his deſign to <hi>ſever</hi> us from the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and to
weaken our Faith in that; when <hi>Eve</hi> was tempted, this was that
he aimed at, that ſhe ſhould <hi>queſtion</hi> the <hi>good earneſt</hi> of the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Hath God ſaid ſo? Was he real in that command, that you ſhould
not Eat at all,</hi> &amp;c. the like he doth to Chriſt, <hi>Is it true? or can it
be ſo as that Voice declared, that thou art the Son of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Though this be his deſign, yet his way to come to
it, is not at <hi>firſt to deny it,</hi> but to <hi>queſtion and enquire,</hi> yet after ſuch
a manner, as may <hi>imply</hi> and withal <hi>ſuggeſt</hi> a <hi>doubting</hi> or ſuſpition
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49412:261"/>
that it is not ſo; he doth not come to Chriſt thus, <hi>Thou art not the
Son of God; or, that Voice that gave thee that Teſtimony, was but a lye or
a deluſion:</hi> but he rather proceeds by queſtioning, which might
<hi>ſeem</hi> to <hi>grant,</hi> that he was ſo, yet withal might poſſibly beget a
doubt in his mind.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Next he more <hi>plainly</hi> ſuggeſts ſomething that may
ſeem to argue the <hi>contrary;</hi> for thus he aggravates Chriſt's preſent
condition of want, <hi>Can it be that God would leave thee to theſe oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſtraits, if thou wert his Son?</hi> At this rate he deals with us, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
the <hi>failure</hi> of outward means of help, the <hi>permiſſion</hi> of
Temptation, the <hi>want</hi> of Comfort, the <hi>continuance</hi> of Affliction,
notwithſtanding Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>probabilities</hi> that we belong not
to God.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, After this, he urgeth Chriſt to a ſinful miſcarriage, to
<hi>diſtruſt</hi> Providence, and to rely no longer on the Care of his Father;
if Chriſt had been prevailed with in this, he would have made uſe
of it, as an Argument to prove that he was not the Son of God
indeed. <hi>'Tis uſual in his diſputings with us about adoption, to put us
upon ſomething, which may be as an Argument out of our own Mouths
againſt us.</hi> Chriſt might have anſwered him in this, as the Man
anſwered <hi>Joah, If I ſhould do ſo, then thou thy ſelf wouldſt ſet thy
ſelf againſt me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, When at laſt, he hath <hi>gradually</hi> aſcended to that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
as to <hi>deny</hi> our Adoption, then (at a very great diſadvantage)
he puts us upon the <hi>proof,</hi> in which he puts by the <hi>ordinary</hi> eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and inſiſts on <hi>extraordinary</hi> proofs as neceſſary. The Servants
of the Lord that are under this exerciſe, do find that in this caſe,
the ordinary evidences of Repentance, Mortification, Love to the
Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do nothing for them: Satan puts their Spirit upon
clamouring for higher evidences; nothing will ſerve except they
may view the <hi>Records of Eternity,</hi> and read their Names enrolled
in the <hi>everlaſting Decrees,</hi> or except God will <hi>ſpeak from Heaven</hi> in an
extraordinary way, to teſtify of them, as <hi>Thomas</hi> reſolved, that no
leſs ſhould ſatisfy his doubt than the feeling and ſeeing of the <hi>print
of the Nails;</hi> To this purpoſe ſome ſtand upon no leſs than a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
for proof of Son-ſhip. Of which we have two Inſtances of
later years,<note place="margin">See their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Print.</note> the one <hi>Mrs. Honywood,</hi> the other <hi>Mrs. Sarah Wight,</hi>
who in their diſtreſſes for their Souls were tempted by Satan to
make an haſty Experiment, the one by throwing a <hi>Venice Glaſs,</hi> the
other by throwing a <hi>Cup</hi> againſt the Wall with this or the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49412:262"/>
                        <hi>If I muſt be ſaved, then let not this Glaſs break:</hi> a deſperate
Temptation! their manner of deſiring ſatisfaction is ſo provoking,
that it cannot be expected God will give an anſwer by it, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the contrary; and if he ſhould not condeſcend, as he is not
bound, (though he ſtrangely preſerved the Cup and Glaſs fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
from breaking) what a dangerous concluſion would
Satan draw from it? Of this <hi>nature</hi> and deſign was that propoſal
of Satans to Chriſt, <hi>Command that theſe Stones be made Bread,</hi> that
is, do it as a proof of thy Son-ſhip.</p>
                     <p>By this we muſt learn this skill,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> not too <hi>eaſily</hi> to give up our
hopes, or to be <hi>Prodigal</hi> of our Intereſt in Chriſt, ſo as to part
with it <hi>ſlenderly.</hi> If Satan would <hi>chiefly</hi> rob us of this, we may
learn thence, to put a <hi>price</hi> upon theſe <hi>Jewels,</hi> and to account that
precious, and of ſingular concernment, which he uſeth ſo much
cunning to bereave us of. Many of the Lords Servants may juſtly
blame themſelves for their <hi>laviſh unthriftineſs</hi> in this matter, who
(as if it were a neceſſary piece of <hi>humility</hi> or <hi>modeſty)</hi> will readily
conclude againſt themſelves, that they are not God's Children,
that they are not yet converted, &amp;c. Thus at <hi>unawares,</hi> they give
up to Satan without a <hi>ſtroke</hi> all that he ſeeks for.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Muſt all Men be confident of Adoption?</p>
                     <p>No,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I mean not ſo, yet all Men muſt be <hi>wary</hi> how they caſt
away their hopes: particularly,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Though it be a dangerous <hi>arrogancy</hi> for a <hi>ſinful</hi> wicked
Creature to bear himſelf up in a <hi>belief,</hi> that he is <hi>converted</hi> and
actually inſtated into the Adoption of Sons; yet 'tis as <hi>dangerous</hi>
on the other hand, for that Man to caſt off <hi>all hope,</hi> and to ſay he is
<hi>reprobated,</hi> and ſuch an one as cannot expect Pardon and Grace.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Thoſe that are converted, though they may and
ought to <hi>humble</hi> themſelves <hi>deeply</hi> for their ſinful <hi>miſcarriage,</hi> and
ſincerely <hi>acknowledg</hi> that they <hi>deſerve</hi> not to be called his Children,
yet muſt they be careful <hi>not to renounce their Filial Intereſt.</hi> They
may ſay they are <hi>Prodigal,</hi> yet keep to this, that <hi>they are Sons;</hi>
though they are <hi>wandering</hi> Sheep, yet muſt they ſtick here, that
they are <hi>Sheep</hi> ſtill, and that God is ſtill a <hi>Father</hi> though a <hi>provoked
Father,</hi> otherwiſe their <hi>folly</hi> will <hi>give</hi> more, then all his <hi>fury</hi> could
<hi>get,</hi> at leaſt ſo quickly and eaſily.</p>

That Satan carried Chriſt in the Air. Of his
Power to moleſt the Bodies of God's Children. How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

Of Satan's Policy in ſeeming to countenance ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Defences. Of his pretended Flight in ſuch caſes,
with the reaſons of that Policy. Of his improving a
Temptation to ſerve ſeveral ends.</head>
                     <p>I Omit Chriſt's Anſwer to the firſt Temptation at preſent
(purpoſing to handle his Anſwers to all the Temptations toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.)
And now the ſecond Temptation is before us, in which,
firſt, I ſhall obſerve a few things in Satan's preparation to the
Temptation, which takes in (1.) the time, (2.) the manner of
his carrying him, (3.) the Place where he acted it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for the Time, That is noted in the word <hi>[then:]</hi> which
(1.) points at the <hi>immediate Succeſſion</hi> of this to the former Aſſault.
The <hi>Evangeliſt Luke</hi> puts this Temptation laſt, but he only had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the ſubſtance of the Temptation, in his Narration; not
regarding the order of them, which <hi>Matthew</hi> hath punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
as appears by his cloſe connecting of them, with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
<hi>Then</hi> and <hi>Again, ver.</hi> 5, 8. Beſides, whoſoever ſhall conſider,
that in the firſt, Satan tempted Chriſt to diſtruſt, (which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49412:263"/>
by telling him that it was his duty (in the failure of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
means) to rely upon Divine Providence, ſeeing Man lives
not by Bread alone, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> he will ſee ſo much of connection in
the matter of the Temptations, that he will eaſily perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that the ſecond place belongs to this, for this is but (as it
were) a fit and pertinent reply to Chriſt's refuſal; as if Satan had
ſaid, <hi>Since thou wilt rely upon the Help and Providence of God, in an
extraordinary way of working, give an Experiment of that, by caſting
thy ſelf down, which thou mayſt with greater confidence do, becauſe he
hath promiſed an extraordinary help, and hath given his Angels charge
concerning thee,</hi> &amp;c. Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>That Satan is not diſcouraged eaſily,<note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> nor doth he always deſiſt upon
the firſt repulſe, but frequently renews the Aſſault, when he is ſtrongly and
reſolutely reſiſted.</p>
                     <p>This word <hi>[then]</hi> doth alſo (2.) tell us of Satan's <hi>Nimbleneſs,</hi>
in catching a preſent advantage for a new Temptation from
Chriſt's Anſwer, he declared his truſt in Providence, this he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
lays hold on, as a fit opportunity to tempt him to preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Here note,</p>
                     <p>That when Satan is upon any deſign,<note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> if an occaſional advantage oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,
from our way of refuſal, he will not let it ſlip, but improves it to
what it may lead to, though it be contrary to that which he was firſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
for.</p>
                     <p>This was the Policy which <hi>Benhadad's</hi> Servants uſed in their
addreſs to <hi>Ahab, 1 Kings</hi> 20. 33. the Men did diligently obſerve
whether any thing would come from him, and did haſtily catch it:
If any thing come from us, we are under his Temptation, he is
diligent to obſerve it, and proſecutes it accordingly; which may
ſerve to ſatisfy the wonder that ſome have, concerning the <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi>
in the Temptations to which they are urged. They admire
how it comes to paſs that their Temptations ſhould ſo ſuddenly
alter, that when Satan ſeems to be ſo intent upon one deſign, he
ſhould ſo quickly change, and urge them preſently to a different,
or contrary thing; but they may know that the Devil watcheth
the Wind, and ſpreads his Sayl according to the advantage which
ariſeth from our anſwer or repulſe. So that if we would but
plow with our own <hi>Heifer,</hi> and obſerve our frame of Spirit, we
ſhould eaſily find out this <hi>Riddle.</hi> For as it is in diſputings and
arguings of Men, <hi>Replies</hi> beget new matter for <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and ſo do
they multiply one another; thus are Temptations altered and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49412:263"/>
and out of the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of one aſſault repelled, another doth
quickly <hi>ſpring</hi> up.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Circumſtance of preparation is, <hi>Satan's taking him
up, and ſetting him on the Temple.</hi> That this was not a viſionary or
an imaginary thing hath been proved before. Yet granting it to
have been real, (as in truth it ſeems to have been) it is diſputed
what was the <hi>Modus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Spanhem.</hi> dub. Evan. in loc.</note> the way and manner of it. Some think this
was no more than Chriſt's voluntary <hi>following</hi> of Satan, who
guided and conducted the way; partly becauſe the words,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, are in Scripture accomodated to a
Mans taking of any as a Companion under his guide, and conduct
of the way, and to a diſpoſal of them in any kind of ſtation.
Thus,<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 13.</note> where 'tis ſaid, Joſeph <hi>took</hi> Mary, <hi>and the young Child to go to</hi>
Egypt, the ſame word is uſed: and when Chriſt tells his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> that they ſhall bring the Aſs and the Colt which they ſhould
find tyed; the ſame word which expreſſeth Chriſt's being ſet on
the Temple, is there uſed. Partly alſo, they think it below the
Dignity of Chriſt to be thus violently hurried.</p>
                     <p>Others think that Satan, was permitted to take up the <hi>Body</hi> of
Chriſt, and by his Power to have conveyed him in the <hi>Air.</hi> And
indeed the whole ſeries of the Narration, with all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
thereof are evident for it. The <hi>diſtances</hi> of places, the
<hi>quickneſs</hi> and ſpeedineſs of the removals, the more proper <hi>applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the words, <hi>taking</hi> and <hi>ſetting,</hi> to Satan as the actor, and
the <hi>declaration</hi> of his Power therein, as able to do great things;
theſe make the matter ſo clear, that it ſeems to be an unnatural
forcing of the Text, to give it any other Interpretation. Beſides,
the former opinion of Satans taking of Chriſt, as a <hi>Manuductor</hi> or
Guide, ſeems every way unreaſonable: for if Chriſt only follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Satan, then it muſt have been either by a <hi>Land Journey</hi> on foot,
or in the <hi>Air.</hi> This latter it could not be; for if Chriſt had ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himſelf in the Air by his own Power, he had <hi>anticipated</hi> the
Temptation, and it would have been folly and madneſs for Satan
to have urged him to fly in the Air, after ſuch an evidence of his
Power; and who can imagine that Chriſt followed Satan on <hi>Foot</hi>
from the Wilderneſs to the Temple, or that his <hi>acceſs</hi> to the
roof of the Temple was ſo eaſy, in ſuch a way when the Temple

one hand bound to another, the Devil thus moleſted her from
eight years old,<note place="margin">New-Caſtle.</note> a long time. This Power of conveying Perſons
in the Air, is not uſual, yet there are ſome in <hi>this place,</hi> that have
known one frequently moleſted by Satan at this rate. However,
if we take notice of his Power, to abuſe the bodies of Holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
more generally, we ſhall find it frequent. <hi>Mary Magdelen</hi>
was poſſeſſed, Chriſt mentions a Daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi> bowed
down by him many years; <hi>Job</hi> was filled with Botches and Sores;
and there are many Diſeaſes wherein Satan hath a greater hand,
than is commonly imagined. <hi>Phyſitians</hi> frequently conclude ſo
much, while they obſerve ſome Diſtempers to clude ſuch Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as are uſually ſucceſsful upon other Perſons under the ſame

                     <p>From this we may infer (1.) the great <hi>Power</hi> of Satan;<note place="margin">Applic.</note> who

<hi>Care</hi> and Providence of God over us in our preſervation
from his fury. (3.) We may further note, that the abuſe of the
bodies of Men by Satan, will be no <hi>evidence,</hi> that therefore God
doth <hi>diſregard</hi> them, or that they are not precious to him. Chriſt
did undergo this abuſe, to give ſuch as ſhall be ſo moleſted, ſome
comfort in his example.</p>
                     <p>The third Circumſtance, which is that of <hi>place,</hi> is ſet down
firſt in general,<note place="margin">Luke 5. 6.</note> The <hi>Holy City,</hi> that is <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for ſo <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks
expreſly. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſo called, becauſe of God's <hi>Worſhip</hi> there
eſtabliſhed, and his <hi>peculier</hi> preſence there; but that it ſhould
be called ſo, at this time may ſeem ſtrange, ſeeing it might now
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49412:264"/>
be lamented as of old, <hi>How is the Faithful City become an Harlot?
Righteouſneſs lodged in it, but now Murtherers.</hi> In anſwer to this,
we muſt know, that God having not yet given her a <hi>Bill of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,</hi>
He is pleaſed to continue her Title and Priviledg. This
might be profitably improved; but I will not ſuffer my ſelf to be
diverted from the matter of Temptation, which is the only thing
I propound to proſecute from hence. I ſhall here only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Holineſs or Sanctity of a Place,</hi>

                        <hi>will be no Priviledg againſt

dares not approach a <hi>Church-yard</hi> or a <hi>Church,</hi> neither <hi>Place,</hi> nor
<hi>Duty</hi> can keep him off. I do not believe the Popiſh Fiction of
their <hi>St. Bennets</hi> Viſion, wherein they tell of his ſeeing but one
Devil in a Market, and ten in a Monaſtery; yet I queſtion not the
truth of this, that the Devil is as buſy at a <hi>Sermon,</hi> or <hi>Prayer,</hi> as at
any other <hi>Imployment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to ſearch a little further into this matter. It ſeems undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that Satan had a deſign in reference to the place, (of which
afterward;) and I ſee no reaſon to exclude our ſuſpicion of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
from the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> which the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> here gives to
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 'Tis an expreſſion which (to my remembrance) we
meet not with oft in the <hi>New-Teſtament.</hi> At the Suffering of
Chriſt, when the bodies of the Saints aroſe out of their Graves,
'tis ſaid,<note place="margin">Mat. 27 53</note> 
                        <hi>they went into the Holy City;</hi> but 'tis evident, that it is
there ſo ſtyled upon ſpecial deſign, as if the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> would by
that point at the <hi>ſtaining of their Glory,</hi> and that in a little time their
boaſt of the Temple and Holy City ſhould ceaſe, and that all
ſhould be polluted with the Carcaſſes of the Slain; and by the ſame
reaſon may we ſuppoſe, that Satan (intending for Chriſt a
Temptation of preſumption, and backing it with the Promiſe of
a Guard of Angels) had in his Eye the uſual Confidence that
the <hi>Jews</hi> had of that City, as a place where the preſence of Angels
might be more expected than elſewhere. So that it ſeems, Satan
intended to <hi>impoſe</hi> upon Chriſt a <hi>Confidence,</hi> in order to preſumption.
From the priviledg of the <hi>Place,</hi> here obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Satan is willing to gratify us with Nominal and Imaginary
Priviledges and Defences againſt himſelf;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 5.</note> he will willingly allow us
ſuch <hi>defences,</hi> as are altogether <hi>inſignificant</hi> and deluſive, and his
Policy here is centred upon theſe two things:</p>

Firſt, He doth induſtriouſly <hi>prompt</hi> us to <hi>ſelf-deviſed inventions,</hi>
ſuch as were never appointed or bleſſed of God to any ſuch uſe,
but only found out by the bold ſuperſtitions of Men. Of this we
have an inſtance in <hi>Balack,</hi> who carried <hi>Baalam</hi> from place to place

too much of this, what Power they Attribute to <hi>Holy-Water,

Reliques, Baptized-Bells, Exorciſms,</hi> and abundance of ſuch Stuff,
may be ſeen in many of their Writings, too tedious to be
related.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He is alſo willing that Men uſe thoſe <hi>real defences</hi>
and helps which God hath commanded, ſo that they uſe them in a
<hi>formal manner,</hi> which indeed deprives them of all the Life and
Efficacy, that might be expected from an inſtituted means; thus
he readily permits ignorant Perſons without any diſturbance or
moleſtation, to uſe the repetition of the <hi>Lords-Prayer, Ten-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>
and <hi>Creed,</hi> or any other Prayer, while they perſwade
themſelves, that the very <hi>ſaying</hi> of the words, is a ſufficient <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi>
againſt the Devil all that day.</p>
                     <p>The reaſons of Satan's Policy in ſuch Gratifications are
theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, While we are <hi>kept doing</hi> with theſe, we are <hi>diverted</hi> from
that which might be really helpful; he puts a broken <hi>Reed</hi> into
our hand, that we might be deprived of a <hi>Staff.</hi> Experience
confirms this, thoſe that with <hi>greateſt devotion</hi> uſe theſe empty <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,</hi>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:49412:265"/>
are uſually careleſs in the uſe of <hi>God's own Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Beſides that he thus betrays them by theſe <hi>lying</hi> helps,
he doth by this means caſt them on a further iniquity, of <hi>idolizing</hi>
theſe fooliſh <hi>Calves</hi> of their own <hi>invention.</hi> In this caſe Men have
a preſumptuous expectation from ſuch uſages, of that which God
never promiſed to do by them, neither ever entred into his heart
ſo to do; ſeeing he anſwers them all with this, <hi>Who hath required
theſe things at your hands?</hi> And accordingly their Conſciences are
more concerned for the <hi>Omiſſion</hi> of one of theſe <hi>Fooleries,</hi> than for
the <hi>neglect</hi> of the <hi>greater</hi> things of the Law; ſuch are more troubled
for the neglect of the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> or <hi>Holy-Water,</hi> than for
their conſtant <hi>careleſneſs,</hi> and want of <hi>Faith,</hi> by which their Hearts
ſhould be guarded againſt their Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In the mean time, he makes work for his own Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over them, that dote upon theſe ſottiſh Inventions. If we
can ſuppoſe Satan to have Pleaſure or Mirth at any thing, we may
be ſure he will laugh at ſuch preparations, for a Spiritual Welfare;
it being as truly <hi>ridiculous</hi> for any Man to go out with theſe <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons</hi>
againſt Satan, as for a Combatant to aſſail a <hi>Gyant,</hi> with a
<hi>Paper-Helmet,</hi> a <hi>Wicker-Shield,</hi> and a <hi>Wooden-Daggar.</hi> And indeed
when Satan counterfeits a Flight, or fear of ſuch matters, (as for
his advantage he ſometimes doth, it is but in deſign to <hi>beget</hi> or
confirm in Men a confidence of a <hi>Vertue</hi> or ſtrength in theſe <hi>uſages</hi>
againſt his Power; that ſo they may fix upon them to the neglect
of God's own Inſtitutions, which he moſt dreads. Thus we read,

of thoſe Spiritual <hi>Weapons,</hi> which the Scripture recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends.</p>

Theſe we have obſerved from the place in general, the Holy
City: Let us go on to the place in particular, where Satan <hi>acted</hi> all
this; <hi>the Pinacle of the Temple.</hi> Various are the conjectures of Men
about this, whether it were ſome <hi>Fane,</hi> or the top of ſome <hi>Spire,</hi>
or the place whence the <hi>Apoſtle James</hi> was thrown down, or the
top of the <hi>Kings Porch,</hi> which was erected to a great height, over
a deep Valley, or ſome <hi>Battlement,</hi> &amp;c. But we are not concerned
in ſuch inquiries, only here I ſhall take notice of <hi>Scultetus,</hi> who

                     <p>'Tis more profitable to enquire after Satans <hi>Reaſon</hi> for the choice

what that deſign was, is not ſo eaſy to determine, it ſeems plain,

a <hi>conviction general,</hi> that he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> about that time uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally

If the <hi>Jews</hi> expected <hi>Elias</hi> to come from Heaven to the Temple,

(already explained) the <hi>Temptation</hi> intended offers it
ſelf to our view, which is this: <hi>Caſt they ſelf down.</hi> What Satan
chiefly intended by it, we may collect from Chriſt's anſwer, as
well as from the thing it ſelf, for he thus replys; <hi>It is written, thou
ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> Chriſt doth not uſe this Scripture
to any ſuch ſenſe as this, that he ſhould hereby prohibit <hi>Satan</hi> to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49412:267"/>
tempt <hi>him,</hi> becauſe he was Satan's Lord and God, but he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
this Scripture as a <hi>rule</hi> of Obedience, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>I may
not caſt my ſelf down, and ſo rely on extraordinary help, ſeeing I can
go down another way,</hi> for the <hi>neglect</hi> of ordinary means, when we
have them, is a <hi>tempting</hi> of God, which may not be done. So
that it appears by this, that Satan here tempted Chriſt to <hi>preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
There is only this objection in our way; that <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 16.
(the place by Chriſt cited) refers to the Temptation of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
in <hi>Maſſah,</hi> mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 2. where they chide with <hi>Moſes</hi>
for Water; and there it would ſeem their tempting the Lord,
was rather in <hi>deſpairing</hi> of his power and help, than <hi>preſuming</hi> in
the neglect of the ordinary means. I Anſwer, though the <hi>occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and <hi>matter</hi> of that Temptation be <hi>different</hi> from this of Chriſt's,
yet the <hi>preſumptuous Experiment</hi> that they there made of God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
and Power was the <hi>ſame</hi> with this which Satan deſigned: for
<hi>ver.</hi> 7. (where the account of that tempting is given) 'tis ſaid,
<hi>becauſe they tempted the Lord, ſaying, Is the Lord among us or not?</hi> they
put it to this iſſue, that the <hi>Being</hi> and Power of God ſhould be <hi>tryed</hi>
by the giving or not giving of Water. The manner then of that
Temptation being ſo agreeable to this, Chriſt very pertinently
applies that command to it, preſumption being the thing which
Chriſt was tempted to. It might occaſion ſome wonder in us to
ſee Satan take ſuch ſtrange ſteps: He was before tempting him to
<hi>deſpair,</hi> now to <hi>preſumption,</hi> but 'tis no Argument of his <hi>lightneſs</hi> or
uncertain roving in his way of tempting, but rather of his <hi>depth</hi>
and ſubtilty. Note then,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That 'tis Satans Policy in tempting,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>to run from one extream to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were firſt tempted to a ſinful <hi>complyance</hi> with
the adulterous Perſon, and were averſe to his Excommunication;
afterwards they were tempted to the contrary <hi>ſeverity,</hi> and were
as backward to receive him again. The ſame Men that have been
overcome by Prodigality and Exceſs; when they begin to ſee
the Evil of that, are oft tempted to Worldineſs or Covetouſneſs, the
contrary diſpoſition. Reaſons of this Policy are,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The avoiding of one <hi>Extream</hi> gives the Soul ſuch a <hi>ſwing,</hi>
(if care be not uſed to prevent it) that they are caſt more than
half way upon the other. <hi>Peter</hi> in an Extream of Modeſty, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the <hi>waſhing</hi> of his Feet by Chriſt, but when he underſtood the
danger,<note place="margin">Joh. 13. 9.</note> then he runs as far wrong another way, <hi>Not my Feet only,
but my Hands and my Head.</hi> Thus ſome are ſo for <hi>purity</hi> of Churches
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49412:267"/>
that they exclude the Weak; others ſo for <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the open Scandalous and Prophane.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, While Men avoid one Extream by running into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
they carry with them ſuch ſtrong <hi>Impreſſions</hi> of the Evil
they would avoid, and ſuch <hi>fierce</hi> Prejudices, that 'tis not an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
conviction will bring them <hi>right,</hi> but they are apt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of the Goodneſs of the way they take, and ſo are the more
bold and fixed in their miſcarriage.</p>
                     <p>Preſumption being the great Deſign of Satan in this Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we may further obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That as Diſtruſt on the one hand,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>ſo Preſumption on the other, is one
of his grand Deſigns.</hi> Of theſe two, we may ſay as it was ſaid of
the Sword of <hi>Hazael</hi> and <hi>Jehu,</hi> that of all thoſe that are ſlain by
the Devil, whoſoever hath eſcaped the Sword of <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
the Sword of <hi>Preſumption</hi> hath ſlain. To explain this I
ſhall,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Shew what Preſumption is. 'Tis in the General, <hi>a
Confidence without a Ground.</hi> Firſt 'tis made up of <hi>Audacity,</hi>
(which is a bold and daring undertaking of a thing) and
<hi>Security.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Ground of it is an <hi>Error</hi> of Judgment, (a blind
or a miſled Judgment doth always nouriſh it;) and this is either
a miſtake of the <hi>Nature</hi> of ſuch means on which we rely for Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<note place="margin">Reynolds <hi>on Paſſions</hi> c. 23. p. 238.</note> (as when a Man lays as much ſtreſs upon a Thred as upon
a Cable, or expects as much Nouriſhment from a Stone as from
Bread;) or a miſtake of the <hi>Will</hi> of others, from whom we expect
aid and help, without a <hi>warrant</hi> for ſuch a Confidence.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In its way of working, 'tis directly <hi>oppoſite</hi> to Diſtruſt,
and is a kind of <hi>exceſſive</hi> (though irregular) Hope, not that in this
caſe a Man believes or hopes over-much,<note place="margin">Non ideo pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur quia ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis ſperat in Deum—Sed quia nimis le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viter ac temerè ſine ullo fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damento.</note> (for there can be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
properly in the exerciſe of Divine Graces) but that he hopes
too <hi>raſhly</hi> or lightly, without a ſolid <hi>Foundation</hi> or Reaſon. Hope
hath for its Object that which is <hi>Good,</hi> under the conſiderations of
<hi>futurity, poſſibility,</hi> and <hi>difficulty;</hi> on the one ſide deſperation looks
upon that good as <hi>future,</hi> but under ſo great a <hi>difficulty,</hi> that it
forgets the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of it,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ames. Medul.</hi> l. 2. c. 6. §. 33.</note> and thereupon <hi>ſurceaſeth</hi> all indeavours:
Preſumption on the other hand is ſo <hi>keenly</hi> apprehenſive of the
<hi>poſſibility,</hi> that it never regards the <hi>difficulty,</hi> and ſo thruſts forward
into <hi>irregular</hi> endeavours or expectations. The Nature of this
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49412:268"/>
will be better underſtood when the particular Inſtances of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
are before us.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Then 'tis Preſumption, when from <hi>External</hi> or <hi>Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi>
Means, Men expect that for which they were never <hi>deſigned</hi>
nor appointed of God. To expect <hi>Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of
Thiſtles,</hi> would be a Preſumption, becauſe God never deſign'd
them for ſuch Fruits; and no leſs is it, when in any other caſe
Men look for high and <hi>extraordinary</hi> things, from any <hi>created</hi>
Good, <hi>above</hi> what God hath put into it, by the <hi>Law</hi> of
<hi>Creation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, When Men do expect thoſe Fruits and <hi>Effects</hi> from
any thing, unto which it is appointed, in <hi>neglect</hi> or <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the
<hi>Supreme</hi> Cauſe, without whoſe concurrent Influence they cannot
reach their proper ends. That is, our hopes are wholly centered
upon means, when in the mean time our Eye is not upon God.
Thus, <hi>to make Gold our hope,</hi> Job. 31. 24. <hi>to make Fleſh our Arm,</hi>
Jer. 17. 5. <hi>to make</hi> Aſhur <hi>a Saviour,</hi> Hoſ. 14. 3. or to truſt to any
Creatures whatſoever, is in Scripture condemned as a preſumptuous
<hi>relyance,</hi> and (in regard of the neceſſary diſappointment) a <hi>truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a Lye;</hi> in which Sence, 'tis ſaid that <hi>every Man is a Lyer,</hi>
Pſal. 62. 9. The like Preſumption it is, when we boaſt great things
of our ſelves, and (as <hi>Peter)</hi> make confident engagements, (in
our own ſtrength) that we will avoid ſuch a Sin, or perform ſuch
a Duty: for we are but frail, and all our ſufficiency is from the
Lord, ſo that it can be no leſs than intollerable arrogance, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
any thing of our ſelves without him; neither can Men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to themſelves the <hi>continuance</hi> of that Good or Advantage,
which they have already received from ſecond Cauſes (if their
confidence builds it ſelf upon that ſole conſideration) without a
juſt <hi>blame. Job</hi> had ſaid he ſhould <hi>die in his Neſt,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> that
<hi>he ſhould never be moved,</hi> but both of them afterward noted theſe
confidences to have been no other than deceitful Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, 'Tis a Preſumption to expect things above the <hi>reach</hi> of
our preſent <hi>ſtate</hi> and condition;<note place="margin">Sperare non Speranda.</note> as for a <hi>mean</hi> Man, to beg of
God <hi>Authority,</hi> and Rule, or to expect to be ſet with <hi>Princes;</hi> or
for <hi>ordinary</hi> Chriſtians to look for <hi>Miracles, Signs</hi> from Heaven,
<hi>Viſions, Revelations, extraordinary</hi> Anſwers to Prayers, and the
like, all which expectations are groundleſs, and the iſſue of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
Pride.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:49412:268"/>
Fourthly, When Men expect things <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>Rules</hi> that
God hath ſet for his <hi>diſpenſations</hi> of Mercy, they boldly preſume
upon his <hi>Will.</hi> God hath promiſed preſervation to his Children,
while they are in <hi>God's way,</hi> but if any ſhall go out of that way,
and <hi>ſinfully</hi> put himſelf into <hi>dangers</hi> and hazards, it would be
Preſumption in him to expect a <hi>Preſervation.</hi> 'Tis the ſame in
Spiritual things. God promiſeth Eternal Life, and the Bleſſings
of his Covenant to ſuch as give up themſelves to him, and his
Laws; will it not be intolerable Preſumption for Men <hi>to bleſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their heart</hi> with expectations of reigning with him in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
while in the mean time they <hi>contradict</hi> his own Rule, and neglect
his <hi>Order,</hi> walking in prophaneneſs, and living to themſelves?
This is an high Preſumption of Mercy againſt his expreſs Will.
Hence are ſuch courſes, called <hi>preſumptuous Sins,</hi> Pſal. 19. and
ſuch Sinners tranſgreſs with an <hi>high-hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, 'Tis alſo a Preſumption to expect any Mercy, though
common and uſual, without the <hi>ordinary means,</hi> by which God in
Providence hath <hi>ſetled</hi> the uſual <hi>diſpenſations</hi> of ſuch Favours; as
when Men look for his aid and help, for ſupply of corporal wants,
while they throw off all care, and refuſe their own endeavours,
which are the ways of God's appointment, in the conſciencious uſe
whereof ſuch Mercies are to be expected. The Heathen (upon
the conſideration of the neceſſary connection of Means and the
End) have uſually judged ſuch ſluggiſh expectations,<note place="margin">Admotâ Manu invocanda eſt Minerva.</note> to be no
better than ſolemn mockings of a Diety. In Spiritual things 'tis
no leſs preſumptuous, to expect <hi>Converſion</hi> and an Intereſt in Chriſt
and Heaven, while they <hi>refuſe</hi> the careful uſe of his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and
therefore we are commanded to <hi>pray</hi> for ſuch Bleſſings,<note place="margin">Prov. 2. 3, 4, 5.</note> 
                        <hi>to cry after
Knowledg, and to lift up the Voice for underſtanding,</hi> and to ſecond
theſe Prayers with our own utmoſt endeavours; <hi>to ſeek for it as
for Silver, and to ſearch for it as for hid Treaſures,</hi> and in ſo doing
to expect the finding of the Knowledg of God.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, When ordinary or <hi>extraordinary</hi> Mercies are expected
for an <hi>unlawful</hi> End, as when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at <hi>Maſſa</hi> called for
Water (which they ought to believe God would ſupply them
withal, their condition conſidered) but for a <hi>Teſt</hi> and Proof of
the <hi>Being</hi> of God, for they ſaid, <hi>is God among us or not?</hi> Exod.
17. 7. 'Tis by <hi>James</hi> made a peice of Spiritual unfaithfulneſs, and
<hi>Adultery,</hi> to ask any thing of God with a deſign <hi>to ſpend it upon a
Luſt. Ahaz</hi> his refuſing a Sign when God offered it, (however
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49412:269"/>
he made a ſhew of Modeſty and believing) argued no other thing,
but that he was conſcious to himſelf, that (in caſe he had
accepted it) he ſhould have abuſed that Favour to an unlawful
end, and have tempted God by it, as putting it upon this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
whether there was a God or not. This is alſo another act
of Preſumption; when a Man becomes guilty of any of theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
he is preſumptuous.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I further add to this diſcovery of the nature and
kinds of Preſumption, that this is one of Satan's <hi>grand</hi> Engins:
which I prove by two Demonſtrations.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By Satans common <hi>practice</hi> in this kind upon <hi>all</hi> ſorts of
Men, in <hi>moſt</hi> occaſions: That which is his frequent practice upon
moſt Men, and on moſt occaſions, muſt of neceſſity be underſtood
to be chiefly deſigned. Some Men may poſſibly be free from the
trouble of ſome particular Temptations, (as <hi>Hieronimus Wallerus</hi>
ſaith of <hi>Luther</hi> his Maſter, that he heard him often report of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that he had been aſſaulted and vexed with <hi>all kind</hi> of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſaving only that of <hi>Covetouſneſs)</hi> but none can ſay they have
not been aſſaulted with this. I ſhall make it out by an induction of
particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>generality</hi> of Men that live in the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
are <hi>Preſumptious;</hi> nay the <hi>greateſt</hi> part of the <hi>blind</hi> World
are ſo; they preſume of Mercy and Salvation, the Devil preacheth
nothing elſe, but all hope, no fear, and in theſe <hi>Golden dreams</hi>
they ſlide down to Hell: If we look into their way of ſinning, and
then into their hopes we can judg no leſs of them, they ſtick not
at the moſt grevious abominations, the works of the Fleſh, and in
theſe they continue; 'tis their <hi>Trade,</hi> their <hi>Life,</hi> they make <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
for them, they cannot ſleep except they do wickedly, he that reproveth
is derided by them;</hi> they make but a <hi>mock</hi> and ſport of thoſe things,
which, as the ſhame and reproach of Mankind, ſhould rather <hi>fly</hi>
the Light, and hide themſelves, as things of darkneſs; theſe
things they practiſe without regret or ſorrow of Heart, without
ſmiting upon the Thigh, and in all this they have the confidence
to ſay, <hi>is not the Lord among us?</hi> They can call themſelves Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians,
and have as bold expectations of Eternal Happineſs, as if the
committing of theſe evils were made by God the neceſſary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to everlaſting Happineſs; what is more common? and
yet what more preſumptuous? For (1.) Theſe Men audaciouſly
hope and expect Mercy, expreſly contrary to the peremptory
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49412:269"/>
threatnings of God. God ſaith, <hi>there is no peace to the wicked,</hi> they
ſay, <hi>we ſhall have peace.</hi> (2.) Theſe run upon the greateſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of ruine and wo, with the leaſt fear, in the contempt of all
danger,<note place="margin">Job 39. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>as the Horſe ruſheth into the Battel, who mocketh at fear, and is
not affrighted, neither turneth his Back from the Sword.</hi> (3.) They
dare God to do his worſt, they provoke God to jealouſy, and
that to his <hi>Face;</hi> hence was it that <hi>Nimrod</hi> was ſaid to be a mighty
Hunter <hi>before the Lord.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 38. 7.</note> And <hi>Er</hi> the Son of <hi>Judah,</hi> that he was
wicked <hi>before the Lord:</hi> Becauſe ſuch audacious Sinners will not
(as we may ſay) go behind his Back to ſin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Hypocrites</hi> whoſe carriage is more ſmooth, they alſo
are preſumptuous: for while they hide their Sin, they do againſt
dictates of Conſcience preſume, <hi>that he that made the Eye doth not
ſee;</hi> and that there is a poſſibility to cheat God as well as Men;
beſides their boaſtings and hopes have a ſpecial mark ſet upon
them in Scripture, as audaciouſly falſe, <hi>the hope of the Hypocrite ſhall
be cut off,</hi> their confidence of the Temple of the Lord is <hi>but a lie,</hi>
and ſo termed expreſly by the Prophet.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Even <hi>deſparing</hi> Perſons are not always free of Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The act of Self-murther, is a terrible preſuming upon infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Juſtice. <hi>Spira's</hi> deſire to know the worſt, was of the ſame
kind. Theſe are indeed extraordinary, but there are ſome other
kinds of deſpair that come nearer to Preſumption, as that <hi>ſenſual</hi>
deſpair, which ariſeth out of an exceſſive love of carnal delights,
and a ſecure contempt of Spiritual things: for when ſenſuality
prompts them to <hi>Eat and Drink</hi> while they may, deſpairing and
hopeleſs of a future Happineſs, <hi>for to morrow they ſhall die,</hi> and their
pleaſure ceaſe, they highly preſume againſt the Patience and
Goodneſs of God.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The <hi>beſt</hi> of Men are too frequently overcome by it;
(1.) Not only while they are <hi>overtaken</hi> with Sins more <hi>grievous,</hi>
and above the rate of Sins of Infirmity, to which how lyable the
holieſt Saint may be, (upon Temptation) may be gathered from
<hi>David's</hi> Prayer, <hi>Keep thy Servant from preſumptuous Sins, that they
have not dominion over me;</hi> (2.) But by their earneſt <hi>proſecutions</hi> of
their own <hi>Wills,</hi> when contradicted by Providence. 'Tis by the
Prophet <hi>Eſa.</hi> 9. 9. called a <hi>pride and ſtoutneſs of Heart,</hi> to contend
with Providence, to attempt to build with <hi>hewen Stone, when the
Bricks are faln,</hi> or to ſtrive for <hi>Cedars,</hi> when Divine Wrath hath
cut down the <hi>Sycamores.</hi> (3.) How frequently are they guilty
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49412:270"/>
of preſuming upon their <hi>Priviledges,</hi> their <hi>Strength,</hi> their <hi>Graces,</hi>
and upon that ſcore <hi>venture</hi> themſelves upon <hi>occaſions</hi> of Sin, or
<hi>bear</hi> high above others upon a conceit of their higher attainments,
or when they <hi>boldly</hi> put themſelves upon <hi>Suffering,</hi> or upon <hi>doing</hi>
while they want that due <hi>Humility</hi> and care that ſhould ballance
them. (4.) There is alſo a Preſumptuous Raſhneſs, upon which
the <hi>Zeal</hi> and good Intentions of holy Men may ſometimes <hi>precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi>
them. Such was <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzahs</hi> putting forth his hand to hold the
<hi>Ark,</hi> for which the Lord ſmote him. All theſe inſtances put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
will ſufficiently demonſtrate that Preſumption is one of
Satan's Maſter-Deſigns.</p>
                     <p>The Second Demonſtration of this Truth is from the general
<hi>ſubſerviency</hi> of other things to this. Moſt of Satans indeavours and
Temptations aim at this point, and this is the reſult and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of moſt Sins; that muſt needs be <hi>chief</hi> to which ſo many
things do but <hi>ſerve</hi> and miniſter. In this Center do moſt of the
lines of his Policy meet, <hi>Pride, Vain-Glory, Conceited-Priviledges,
Suppoſed-Advantages,</hi> and many things more were but <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents</hi>
to this Temptation, which the Devil attempted upon Chriſt,
as hath in part, and preſently ſhall be further evidenced.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Having thus proved that Preſumption is one of the
great things he aims at, I ſhall next diſcover the Reaſons of his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs
and induſtry in his Deſign, which are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, 'Tis a Sin very <hi>Natural,</hi> in which he hath the advantage
of our own <hi>readneſs</hi> and inclination. However that ſome from a
<hi>melancholy</hi> temper, are inclinable to <hi>fears</hi> and diſtruſt at ſome time,
when theſe <hi>black</hi> apprehenſions are <hi>exalted,</hi> yet (theſe excepted)
<hi>hopes</hi> are more predominant than Fears; and <hi>Self-love,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
fewel to theſe hopes, is a Natural Principle in all; when ſo
many things give him ſuch Advantages, and promiſe him a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
we may well ſuppoſe he will not miſs ſuch an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As 'tis eaſy for Satan's attempt, ſo 'tis <hi>remote</hi> from
<hi>conviction,</hi> and not rooted out without great difficulty: 'tis a Sin
that is <hi>covered</hi> with a <hi>pretext</hi> of an higher degree of <hi>hope:</hi> Men in
many ways of this iniquity are under <hi>perſwaſions</hi> of Duty, and by
reaſon of that confidence, <hi>Fear</hi> (which is the Souls <hi>Centinel)</hi> is
<hi>aſleep,</hi> hence do they not lye ſo fairly open to Counſel or Reproof.
The <hi>Iſraelites, Deut.</hi> 1. 27, 28. being under diſcouragement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to go up to <hi>Canaan,</hi> when they were upon the border of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49412:270"/>
Land; but being convinced of their Sin, in diſtruſting the Arm of
the Lord, by Gods declared Wrath and threatning againſt them,
they fall upon the contrary extream of preſumption, and then
<hi>ver. 41. they would go up and Fight:</hi> and the <hi>conviction</hi> of their <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
Sin, made them ſo confident that this was their preſent duty,
(for thus they argue, <hi>we have ſinned againſt the Lord, we will go up
and ſight, according to all that the Lord our God commanded us;)</hi>
that though they were expreſly <hi>forbidden</hi> from God, <hi>ver. 42. Go
not up, neither fight, for I am not among you;</hi> yet were they ſo
ſtrangely carried by their former perſwaſion, that they refuſed to
be convinced, <hi>and went preſumptuouſly into the Hill.</hi> By which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
we ſee, what great <hi>pretences</hi> lead on Preſumption, and
how <hi>difficulty</hi> they are removed: which two things do no leſs than
tempt Satan to lay out himſelf to the uttermoſt in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of the Sin when 'tis committed, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſon of his diligence in the purſuit of it; 'tis not only from
a ſimple Error or Miſtake, but that <hi>Error</hi> ariſeth from <hi>intollerable
Pride;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eſa. 9. 9.</note> they ſay and do ſuch things from the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Stoutneſs</hi> of
their Heart. He that is Preſumptuous, is Self-willed, 2 <hi>Pet. 2.
10.</hi> Hence theſe Sins,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 13.</note> which we tranſlate Preſumptuous, are in
the original,<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 12.</note> called <hi>Prides</hi> or <hi>Arrogancies.</hi> Beſides, they are <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi>
to God's <hi>Order, ſeparating</hi> thoſe things that God hath <hi>joyned</hi>
together, as the <hi>Means</hi> from the <hi>End,</hi> or the <hi>End</hi> from the <hi>Means,</hi>
as if the <hi>Earth ſhould be turned out of its place</hi> for us. And in ſome
caſes, 'tis no leſs than the open <hi>affronting</hi> of God, by abuſing his
own Favours againſt himſelf; for thus they deal with him, who
are <hi>opinionated</hi> in Sin becauſe of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> concluding, by an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational
Conſequence, that they <hi>ought</hi> to be wicked becauſe God
is <hi>Good,</hi> or that they may <hi>freely offend</hi> becauſe he doth <hi>not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The dangerous <hi>Iſſues</hi> and Conſequences of this way
of ſinning, do not a little animate Satan to tempt to it. In ſome
caſes it was to be puniſhed by Death, <hi>Deut. 17. 12. The Man that
doth preſumptuouſly,—Even that Man ſhall die:</hi> and moſt uſually
it is plagued with ſad diſappointments, by a ſevere engagement
of God's diſpleaſure againſt it.<note place="margin">Job 8. 13. &amp; 11. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>The Hypocrites hope ſhall periſh, it
ſhall be as the giving up of the Ghoſt.</hi> And generally, <hi>He that</hi> thus
<hi>bleſſeth himſelf in his Heart, when he heareth the Words of the Curſe,</hi>
Deut. 29. 19, 20. <hi>the Lord will not ſpare him, but then the Anger of</hi>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:49412:271"/>
the Lord and his jealouſy ſhall ſmoak againſt that Man, and all the
Curſes that are written in this Book ſhall lye upon him, and the Lord ſhall
blot out his Name from under Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and laſtly; I ſhall lay before you, the <hi>deceitful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance</hi>
of Satan in bringing this Sin about, by ſhewing the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of his craft againſt Chriſt herein. As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He takes <hi>advantage</hi> from his <hi>Reſolve</hi> to rely upon Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
contrary to the former Temptation of turning Stones to
Bread; Chriſt had refuſed that, telling him it was duty to truſt
him, who not only by the ordinary means of Bread could feed him,
but alſo by any other appointment. To this Satan rejoyns, by
offering an <hi>irregular opportunity of ſuch a truſt,</hi> in caſting himſelf
from the Pinacle of the Temple; as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>If thou wilt
thus rely upon Providence, do it in this.</hi> Wherein we may note, <hi>that
from an obediential dependance, he would draw Chriſt to an irregular
Preſumption.</hi> He retorts Chriſts Argument back again upon him
thus, <hi>If God is to be relyed upon by a certain truſt for Food, by the like
truſt he is to be relyed upon for Preſervation; if the belief of ſupply of
Bread, can conſiſt with a neglect or refuſal of ordinary means for the
procurement thereof, then may the belief of Preſervation in caſting thy
ſelf from the Pinacle of the Temple conſiſt alſo with a neglect of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Means.</hi> Thus like a cunning <hi>Sophiſter</hi> he endeavours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<hi>Sin</hi> from <hi>Duty,</hi> from a ſeeming parity betwixt them,
though indeed the caſes were vaſtly different. For though it be
duty to depend upon Providence, when <hi>God</hi> (in the <hi>purſuit</hi> of
<hi>Service</hi> and Duty) brings us out of the <hi>ſight</hi> and hopes of <hi>outward
means,</hi> yet it can be no leſs than <hi>ſinful</hi> Preſumption, for us to
make ſuch <hi>Experiments</hi> of Providences, when we <hi>need</hi> not, and
when <hi>ordinary</hi> means are at hand. After the ſame manner doth
he endeavour to put Fallacies upon us, and to cheat us into Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
undertakings, by arguing from a <hi>neceſſary truſt,</hi> in ſome
caſes, a <hi>neceſſity of preſuming</hi> in others, upon a ſeeming likeneſs
and proportion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It was no ſmall piece of Satan's craft to take this
advantage, while the <hi>Impreſſion</hi> of Truſt, in the want of outward
means was <hi>warm</hi> upon the Heart of Chriſt, he hoped thereby the
more eaſily to draw him to an exceſs. For he knows that a <hi>Zealous
earneſtneſs</hi> to avoid a Sin, and to keep to a Duty, doth <hi>often</hi> too
much <hi>incline</hi> us to an extream, and he well hoped, that when
Chriſt had declared himſelf ſo <hi>poſitively</hi> to depend upon God, he
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49412:271"/>
might have prevailed to have <hi>ſtretched</hi> that dependance beyond its
due bounds, taking the opportunity of his ſway that way, which
(as a Ship before Wind and Tide) might ſoon be overdriven.
And this was the deſign of his <hi>Haſte</hi> in this ſecond Temptation,
becauſe he would ſtrike while the <hi>Iron was hot,</hi> and cloſely purſue
his advantage, while the ſtrength and forwardneſs of theſe reſolves
were upon him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He endeavours to animate him to this Preſumption
by <hi>popular Applauſe,</hi> and to tickle him into an humour of affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Glory and Admiration, which by ſuch a <hi>ſtrange</hi> underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
might be raiſed in the minds of the <hi>Spectators,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did he bring him to the moſt conſpicuous place of a great
and populous City, not thinking the matter ſo feaſible if he had
tempted him to it in a ſolitary Deſert.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He propounds to him a <hi>plauſible End,</hi> and a ſeeming
advantage, <hi>viz.</hi> the clear and undoubted <hi>diſcovery</hi> of his <hi>Divine
Nature</hi> and near Intereſt in God; urging this as a neceſſary Duty,
for his own ſatisfaction, and the manifeſtation of his Son-ſhip to
others.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, To drive out of his Mind thoſe <hi>fears of miſcarrying</hi> in
his attempt, which otherwiſe might have been a Block in his way:
he is officious in ſtrengthning his confidence, by propounding
<hi>treacherous helps</hi> and preſervatives, ſuggeſting a ſafety to him from
the <hi>Priviledg</hi> of the <hi>place</hi> where this was to be acted, an <hi>Holy City</hi>
and <hi>Temple,</hi> producing more of a Divine Preſence for his ſafety
than other places.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, To make all ſure, he backs all this with a <hi>Promiſe
of Preſervation;</hi> that nothing might be wanting to his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
                     <p>By this Method applyed to other things and Caſes, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to bring us to Preſumption.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of this ſhould put us upon a ſpecial <hi>care</hi> and
watchfulneſs againſt <hi>Preſumption;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Applic.</note> It is more deſigned, and hath a

                     <p>Firſt, He that would be kept from <hi>Preſumptuous</hi> Sins, muſt make

to beg pardon for them. With what Face or Hope can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

leave us to our ſelves, by indulging our ſelves in the other?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He that would avoid them, muſt be under the <hi>awe</hi>
and fear of being <hi>overcome</hi> by them: he that <hi>ſlights</hi> and contemns

How he tempts to Self-murther directly, and upon what
advantage he urgeth it. How he tempts to it indirectly,
and the ways thereof. Of neceſſary Preſervatives againſt
this Temptation.</head>
                     <p>WE have ſeen and conſidered the <hi>main</hi> End of Satan in this
Temptation. Let us further conſider whether this was the
<hi>ſole</hi> End that he propounded to himſelf: we have little reaſon to
think that he would confine himſelf to one, when the thing it
ſelf doth ſo clearly ſuggeſt another, which might poſſibly have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
In moſt caſes, the Ends of the Devil are manyfold: we
may therefore eaſily ſuppoſe (and ſeveral have noted it) that the
Devil (that great Murtherer) had herein a ſecret deſign againſt
the Life of Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dikson</hi> in loc. <hi>Capel</hi> Tempt. Part 2. cap. 9.</note> and that he tempted him here (indirectly) to
<hi>Self-Murther.</hi> And indeed (ſuppoſing that Chriſt had attempted
to fly in the Air, and had failed in the Interpriſe,) what elſe
could have followed but Death and Ruine? Hence let us
Note,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Satan ſeeks the ruine of our Bodies,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>as well as of our Souls, and
tempts Men often to Self-Murther.</hi> That the Devil goes about ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how he may deſtroy Men, by putting them upon attempts
againſt their own Lives, is evident, not only from the Experience
and Confeſſions of ſuch as have ſuffered under Satan's <hi>ſuggeſtions</hi>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:49412:272"/>
to that End, (and it is a Temptation more common, than we
think off, becauſe moſt Men are unwilling to lay open themſelves
to others in this matter) but alſo from thoſe many <hi>ſad Inſtances</hi> of
Men over whom Satan ſo far prevails, that they <hi>execute</hi> upon
themſelves this deſign, by deſtroying themſelves. Yet by the way
we may note, That ſuch thoughts are often in the minds of Men,
where Satan is not <hi>induſtriouſly</hi> deſigning their deſtruction; for he
often caſts in ſuch thoughts, not only to <hi>try</hi> how Men take with
them, but to <hi>affright</hi> and diſquiet them, and 'tis uſually with Men
of ſad and <hi>Melancholly</hi> tempers to <hi>miſtake</hi> their own <hi>fears</hi> of ſuch a
Temptation, for Satan's <hi>endeavours</hi> againſt them, when indeed
their fear and trouble <hi>leſt</hi> they ſhould be ſo tempted, makes them
think they <hi>are</hi> tempted indeed.</p>
                     <p>Satan drives on the Deſign of Self-Murther, two ways.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, directly, when in <hi>plain terms</hi> he urgeth Men to deſtroy
themſelves. This (becauſe 'tis directly repugnant to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which vehemently urgeth them to Self-Preſervation) he
cannot effect, but by the help of ſome <hi>advantages;</hi> yet ſome ways
and methods, by experience, he hath found to be ſo available to
ſuch an unnatural reſolve, that he frequently puts them in practice.
As, firſt, He works upon the <hi>Diſcontents</hi> of Men, and improves
the diſquiet of their Minds, (upon the occaſion of any loſs, vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
diſappointment or diſgrace,) to as great an height as he
can, and when their Lives are made <hi>bitter</hi> to them, and they are
ſufficiently prepared by the <hi>uneaſineſs</hi> of their condition; then he
propounds Death, as the only remedy to ſet them at quiet; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
beſides his officiouſneſs to provide them with <hi>inſtruments</hi> of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
and <hi>opportunity</hi> for their uſe, he follows them with <hi>Arguments,</hi>
drawn from the ſence of their preſent Condition; the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
whereof is to <hi>aggravate</hi> their ſmart, and to make their
burthen ſeem intollerable, and then Self-ruine is but a natural
Conſequence. We may ſee enough of this in the diſcontents of
good Men, and that they naturally work this way; <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks
the general apprehenſions of Men in trouble, <hi>Job 3. 20, 21. The bitter
in Soul value not Life, they long for Death, and dig for it more than
for bid Treaſures; they rejoyce exceedingly, and are glad when they can
find the Grave. Jonah</hi> in his diſcontent prefers Death before Life,
<hi>It is better for me to die than to live; Elias</hi> doth the like, and <hi>Job</hi>
ſeems impatient for it. All this is from the power and working of
this Temptation, though God held their hand that it did not fully
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49412:273"/>
prevail. In <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> the ground of diſcontent was more a
fancied than a real diſgrace; his Counſel was rejected (which was
in it ſelf no great diſhonour) and this works up ſuch a perplexing
<hi>reſentment</hi> in his Mind, that Satan prevails with him to hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
very <hi>deliberately.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, He moſt frequently drawn on Men to deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by <hi>terrors</hi> and deſparing troubles of <hi>Conſcience;</hi> theſe as they
afford <hi>greater</hi> diſquiet and diſtreſs of mind than other kind of
diſcontentments, ſo doth he <hi>more</hi> prevail by them; for a wounded
Spirit is above ordinary ſtrength, and hard to bear: only it may
may ſeem ſtrange, that thoſe who ſo experimentally feel how
<hi>fearful a thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
ſuch a Temptation, as (to their apprehenſions and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg)
will <hi>certainly plung</hi> them into the very <hi>Ocean</hi> of everlaſting
<hi>Vengeance.</hi> This no doubt Satan finds to be no ſmall obſtruction to
his deſign, but here he uſeth his skill to <hi>open</hi> a way for them that
would <hi>out-run</hi> their lives on the one hand, as he labours to <hi>purſue</hi>
them with <hi>ſence</hi> of Wrath and Indignation on the other hand. To
this purpoſe, he tells them, (1.) that all the Hell they are to meet
with is <hi>in their Conſciences,</hi> and that Death will <hi>free</hi> them from all,
or at leaſt, that Death will give a preſent <hi>eaſe,</hi> and that till the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi>
they ſhall be in quiet. Thoſe that are willing to receive
theſe apprehenſions, may eaſily be prevailed with to haſten their
own death, ſeeing they have already fixed this Concluſion with
themſelves, that there is <hi>no hope</hi> nor pardon for them; that they
are <hi>Reprobates</hi> and cut off, for their thoughts can <hi>meditate</hi> nothing
but the <hi>terrors</hi> of ſuch Concluſions. (2.) He ſometimes endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to perſwade them, that by executing this revenge upon
themſelves, they may make ſome kind of <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> and amends
for the ſins they have commited: which though moſt falſe, yet
'tis a wonder how far ſuch ungrounded Surmiſes may poſſeſs the
Minds of the Deſperate.<note place="margin">Capel <hi>Tempt.</hi> Part 9. cap. 9. <hi>citing</hi> Aug. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

thought when he deſtroyed himſelf, is conjectured by ſome: but
that muſt be but a conjecture, ſeeing none can pretend to know
his thoughts; but we may ſpeak with greater freedom of thoſe,
who have declared the working of ſuch apprehenſions upon their
Minds. (3.) A more plauſible pretext he uſeth when he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to perſwade them, that they may <hi>kill</hi> themſelves, and yet
<hi>go to Heaven</hi> for all that; to this purpoſe the ſubtil Adverſary is not
backward to tell them, what have been the <hi>Charitable Expreſſions</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:49412:273"/>
of ſome Men, who have ſuppoſed a poſſibility of Repentance,
<hi>inter pontem &amp; fontem,</hi> as we ſay, betwixt the Stroke or Halter,
and the Death. <hi>Capel</hi> is ſo apprehenſive of the miſcheivous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of this Charity,<note place="margin">Capel <hi>Tempt.</hi> ibid.</note> for an encouragement to Self-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he with great earneſtneſs <hi>cautions</hi> all Miniſters againſt
ſuch <hi>liberal</hi> Expreſſions. I have known ſome, and heard of others
that have been ſo poſſeſſed with this Imagination, of being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
notwithſtanding that having purpoſed to deſtroy themſelves,
(though God prevented them that they did it not) they have
firſt by <hi>Prayer</hi> recommended themſelves to God, and ſo prepared
themſelves to die. (4.) Sometimes though ſuch afflicted ones,
have no ſuch perſwaſion, but that from <hi>Death</hi> they go immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>Hell:</hi> yet are they puſhed forward, by a certain fearful <hi>curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity</hi>
of knowing the <hi>worſt.</hi> At that rate did <hi>Spira</hi> expreſs himſelf,
when he deſired to be freed of his Life that he might know the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of thoſe torments which he feared; as if the affrightments of
his fearful expectations, were worſe than the real feeling of them.
(5.) But moſt of all doth he prevail againſt that objection of <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
miſery</hi> after Death, by running Men up to a <hi>deſperate deſtraction</hi>
in their terrors; their preſent anguiſh is made inſupportable, ſo
that they <hi>haſten</hi> out of Life, <hi>without care</hi> or conſideration of what
ſhall follow.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He tempts Men directly to deſtroy themſelves from a
Principle of <hi>Heroick boldneſs,</hi> and ſeeming fortitude of Mind: a
thing very common among the <hi>Romans;</hi> who impatient of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
and from pride of Heart, not willing to ſubject themſelves
to affronts, chuſed rather to tear their own Bowels, than to live
to ſee themſelves abuſed. <hi>Lucretia</hi> being forced by <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> and

but to make ſuch a <hi>prepoſterous</hi> haſte, muſt be a <hi>cheat</hi> of Satan. That
there is a poſſibility of this, may appear in the Story of <hi>Cleombrotus</hi>
(mentioned alſo by <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> who reading <hi>Plato's Phaedo</hi> of the
Immortality of the Soul; that he might haſten thither, threw
himſelf Head-long from a Wall, and dyed. Now though it be
hard to find ſuch an Inſtance among Chriſtians, yet we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to believe, that where Satan perceives ſuch a Temptation
may take place, he will not be wanting in the proſecution. And
if me may conjecture <hi>Auguſtines</hi> thoughts, by that <hi>queſtion</hi> which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49412:274"/>
he propounds,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>De Civit Dei.</hi> l. 1. c. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>viz. Whether it be lawful for a Man to kill himſelf
for the avoiding of Sin.</hi> (which he ſolidly confutes;) We may
conclude,<note place="margin">Non itaque vobis ó Fideles, Chriſti, ſit te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio vita veſtra.</note> that ſuch thoughts, were the <hi>uſual Temptations</hi> of good
Men in his time, and the rather becauſe in the cloſe of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he applyes that diſcourſe particularly to the Servants of Chriſt,
that they ſhould not think their Lives a <hi>Burthen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Satan promotes the deſign of Self-Murther, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Directly,</hi> as we have heard, but alſo by ſome <hi>Indirect</hi> ways he
undermines the Life of Man: That is, when he doth not formally
ſay to them deſtroy your ſelves, but tempts them to ſuch <hi>things,</hi> as
he knows will <hi>let in Death</hi> upon them. This way of ſubtil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
I ſhall explain under theſe heads.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Upon higheſt pretexts of <hi>Zeal</hi> for God's Glory, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
lays a Snare for our Lives; I cannot believe but Satan had
a Hand in that forwardneſs of <hi>Ancient Chriſtians,</hi> who by an <hi>open</hi>
Profeſſion of their Faith before perſecuting <hi>Judicatures,</hi> did as it
were <hi>Court</hi> a Martyrdom; And I have the ſame perſwaſion of the
<hi>painful earneſtneſs</hi> of many Holy Preachers, who laviſh out their
Strength in a <hi>Prodigality</hi> of Pains for the Good of Souls, which
(like a <hi>Theif</hi> in the <hi>Candle)</hi> waſts them immediately;<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Boyles reflectons.</hi> Sec. 2. Med. 10.</note> whereas a
<hi>better husbanded</hi> Strength might be truely more advantagious, as
continuing the Light the longer: and yet ſo ſincere are their ends,
ſo pleaſant is their work, that they ſeldom obſerve, as they ought,
that Satan (when he can do no better) is glad of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to deſtroy them with their <hi>own Weapon;</hi> and therefore in this
caſe, they may expect he will do all he can to <hi>heighten</hi> and forward
their <hi>Zeal,</hi> not only by adding all the <hi>Fewel</hi> he can to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>propenſity</hi> of laboriouſneſs, but alſo by <hi>outward</hi> encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of the declared <hi>Acceptations,</hi> and <hi>Expectations,</hi> of their
Hearers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Upon baſer pretences of the full enjoyment of <hi>ſenſual
Pleaſures,</hi> and carnal Delights, he doth unawares <hi>puſh</hi> Men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to <hi>Death</hi> and Dangers. Thus the Voluptuous, the Glutton,
the Drunkard, <hi>dig</hi> their own <hi>Graves,</hi> and invite Death to cut
them off, before they have lived out half their time. While Satan
tempts Men to ſuch exceſſes of Riot, he labours not only the <hi>deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of the <hi>Soul,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>Body;</hi> not only that they be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but that they may be ſo with all <hi>Expedition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Beſides all theſe, he hath other ſubtile ways of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
the death of Men, by putting them upon ways and <hi>actions</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:49412:275"/>
that are attended with <hi>hazard.</hi> Thus he ſought the death of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> not <hi>directly,</hi> but <hi>indirectly,</hi> by urging him to an <hi>action</hi> which
he thought would unavoidably bring him to <hi>Death;</hi> for a Fall
from ſo great a Praecipice, would eaſily have bereaved any Man of
Life. And ſometimes when Men are beſotted with <hi>Enthuſiaſtical</hi>
Deluſions, he can more eaſily beguile them with ſuch Stratagems:
That Inſtance of <hi>Stuker</hi> is famous, who cut off his Brothers Head,
upon a fooliſh perſwaſion, that God would magnify his great
Power in giving him Life again. If Satan can befool ſuch bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Slaves into ſuch abſurd and unreaſonable apprehenſions in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of others, what hinders but that he may ſo far impoſe upon
them, that they may be willing to practiſe upon themſelves. I
remember ſomething to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">See the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of <hi>Jo. Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi> called the <hi>Quakers ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
                        </note> of one whom the Devil had
well-nigh prevailed with, to make a <hi>hole in his Breaſt,</hi> (which of
neceſſity muſt have let out his Life;) upon a pretended Promiſe of
<hi>giving him Eternal Life,</hi> and was accordingly <hi>forced</hi> to take up a
<hi>Knife,</hi> and to carry it to his Throat. In <hi>Anno</hi> 1647. in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi>
a Company of People were ſeduced to ſacrifice certain Creatures
to God, among the reſt they <hi>Sacrificed their aged Mother,</hi> perſwading
her ſhe ſhould riſe the <hi>third</hi> day, and for this they were Executed at
<hi>York.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may awaken all to be aware of this Temptation;<note place="margin">Applic.</note> ſome
are ſadly concerned in it, many are the complaints which ſome of
us have met withal about it in private, and the apprehenſions of
ſuch hazards are ſadly diſquieting. Through ſuch fears thouſands
of God's dear Children have <hi>paſſed,</hi> and many, too many, have
been <hi>overcome</hi> by this Weapon; thoſe of us that have not yet known
Temptations of this nature, do not know how ſoon we may be
aſſaulted in this kind; 'tis neceſſary for all to ſtand upon their
Guard, and for that end, it behoves us to have at hand theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, 'Tis uſeful to conſider, that this is one of Satan's <hi>great
Plots;</hi> and when we meet with it <hi>cloathed</hi> with never ſo many <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts,
enforced</hi> with never ſo many ſeeming neceſſities, yet muſt we
look upon it as the <hi>Counſel</hi> of an <hi>Enemy,</hi> who certainly intends us
no kindneſs, let him pretend what he will; and therefore may we
be ſure, it will be our ſad inconvenience and diſadvantage.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It muſt be fixed in our minds, that the thing in it
ſelf is an <hi>high Iniquity,</hi> a moſt grievous Provocation; no Inſtance
of Self-Murther (properly ſuch) can be met withal in Scripture,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49412:275"/>
as practiſed by any Holy Perſon: the Command is directly againſt
it, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> If we may not <hi>murther another</hi> (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues)
we may not <hi>murther our ſelves:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Civit. Dei. <hi>l. 1. c.</hi> 20. Non occides, non alterum ergo nec te, neque e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim qui ſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit, aliud quam homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem occidit.</note> 
                        <hi>for he that kills himſelf kills
no other then a Man;</hi> nay we may much leſs lay hand upon our own
Life. 'Tis a greater violation of the <hi>Law</hi> of Nature and of <hi>Love.</hi>
Every Man is neareſt to himſelf; and his love to himſelf, is the
<hi>Pattern</hi> of his love to another. Self-Murther muſt then be a Sin
of <hi>higher aggravations</hi> by far, than the Murther of another Perſon.
And the wiſer <hi>Heathens</hi> were far from countenancing any ſuch cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty;

                           <hi>Aug.</hi> de Civit Dei. <hi>l. 1. c.</hi> 22.</note> If <hi>Plato</hi> had thought it beſt for an <hi>immediate enjoyment</hi> of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
(which is the higheſt pretence of Self-Murther ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable)
to make an end of Life violently,<note place="margin">Et <hi>Coment</hi> Lod. Viv. ibid.</note> he would certainly
have <hi>practiſed</hi> it himſelf, or <hi>recommended</hi> it to others, but he
is ſo far from this, that he ſpeaks againſt it as a <hi>great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, 'Tis neceſſary that Men keep in mind, the <hi>Danger</hi>
that <hi>follows</hi> ſuch an act. Death brings God's unalterable <hi>Mittimus,</hi>
and <hi>ſeals</hi> up the Condition of every Man, ſo that in the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
he comes to Judgment, it puts an end to all Hopes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
Suppoſe then ſuch tempted Creatures to have Fears and
<hi>Terrors</hi> as <hi>great</hi> as you can imagine them to be, yet there is a <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
that they may be <hi>deceived</hi> in them, that their caſe is not ſo
bad as they fear, or (if it be bad enough at preſent) that it may
be <hi>better</hi> afterwards, (for many that have in their anguiſh reſolved
againſt themſelves, have been prevented of the Execution of their
reſolves, and have <hi>lived</hi> to ſee the <hi>Lord and his Salvation;)</hi> And
who is able to determine that ſecret, <hi>that their name is not in the Book
of Life?</hi> Who can ſay, he is certainly excluded out of God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree?
What madneſs is it then to ruſh into <hi>certain</hi> ruine, when
our Fears that diſtreſs us may be but <hi>miſtakes.</hi> It is not ſo <hi>certain</hi>
that Men <hi>ſhall</hi> be damned, becauſe of what they <hi>feel</hi> or fear at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
as it <hi>may</hi> be if they <hi>deſtroy</hi> themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, To prevent occaſions to this Temptation, it muſt
be our care not to give <hi>way to diſcontents</hi> for outward things, nor
to <hi>diſtreſſing</hi> fears, (ſuch as are deſparing and hopeleſs) for our
Spiritual Eſtate: or if we have a burthen either way upon our
Mind, we muſt avoid as much as may be, impatient <hi>fretfulneſs,
leſt Satan get advantage of us. Diſcontented Moods,</hi> and <hi>caſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Hope,</hi> are ſad <hi>occaſions</hi> for this Temptation. If we find our
ſelves thus burthened, we muſt look to it <hi>betimes,</hi> and not ſuffer
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49412:276"/>
it to go too far. And if this Temptation <hi>come,</hi> we muſt take
heed we keep not the Devils <hi>Counſel,</hi> but <hi>diſcover</hi> the matter to
ſome that are wiſe and faithful, able to adviſe and pray for us;
remembring ſtill that if <hi>only outward</hi> things trouble us, we have a
<hi>better</hi> way of eaſe and Remedy, by <hi>ſubmitting</hi> to a chaſtiſing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
if <hi>Spiritual</hi> Troubles move this way, we ſhould not run
<hi>from him,</hi> but rather reſolve to <hi>periſh at his Foot,</hi> as humble Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants
for Mercy and Pardon.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The Temptation muſt alſo be oppoſed with <hi>Faſting
and Prayer;</hi> if this be ſincerely practiſed, it will go away at
laſt.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Something may alſo be ſaid for caution againſt <hi>unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
thruſting</hi> our ſelves (while under ſuch Temptations) into
places of <hi>Danger,</hi> or into a converſe with <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of Death;
this may be too great a daring of the Temptation, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
a miſchief. Yet on the other hand, we muſt not be ſo
<hi>cowardly,</hi> as to be affraid of ſuch <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> unto which
our <hi>Callings</hi> and lawful employments do <hi>engage</hi> us; not to dare to
go over a <hi>Bridg,</hi> or to walk by a <hi>River,</hi> or a <hi>Pit,</hi> if it be our <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
way,</hi> is but to give an advantage to Satan to keep us under
continual <hi>affrightments,</hi> and therefore I ſubſcribe to <hi>Capels</hi> advice,
<hi>We muſt abide by it,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tempt.</hi> Part 2. cap. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>and fight it out by Faith; we muſt not fly the
way, the place, the imployment, but go on and look to God, and at laſt
we ſhall make Satan fly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if ſome object to this,<note place="margin">Object.</note> That their weakneſs is great, and
their fears are ſtrong, and Satan never idle, and that therefore they
have <hi>little</hi> ground to expect an <hi>eſcape.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I ſhall deſire they would
conſider ſeriouſly, the <hi>Inſtance</hi> of Chriſt in this particular, when

though he <hi>tempted</hi> Chriſt to caſt himſelf down: which may
ſufficiently ſatisfy us, that there is a ſure <hi>hedg</hi> of Providence about

Remedies for its Cure. Pride kindled by a confidence of
Priviledges, and Popular Applauſe.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>aims</hi> of Satan in this Temptation being thus explained,
I muſt now offer to your conſideration the <hi>Means</hi> by which he
ſought to bring his End about, which we have noted already,
was <hi>Pride:</hi> this he endeavoured to raiſe up in him two
ways.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By urging to him the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of his Condition, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himſelf to be the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, By offering him the occaſion of <hi>Popular Applauſe,</hi> to
which purpoſe he brought him into the <hi>Holy-City,</hi> where he might
be ſure of many <hi>Spectators.</hi> I ſhall hence note,</p>
                     <p>That Pride is Satan's proper Engine to bring Men on to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.<note place="margin">Obſ. 10.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we ſhould trace the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of preſumptuous Sins, we ſhall
ever find it to have been ſo. <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Sin, was an high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
againſt God's expreſs Command, but Pride was the
Stair by which he knew they muſt aſcend to it; and therefore he
uſed this Argument, to corrupt the Hearts of our firſt Parents, <hi>Ye
ſhall be as God's.</hi> The Preſumption of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> in burning Incenſe
upon the Altar, was from his Pride. 2 <hi>Chron. 26. 16. His Heart
was lifted up, becauſe he was become ſtrong. David's</hi> Preſumption
in numbring the People was from hence; thus might we run
through many Inſtances. But <hi>Satan's</hi> own caſe may be inſtead of
all, his firſt Sin (though we have but conjecture what it was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly)
is concluded by all to have been highly <hi>Preſumptuous,</hi>
and the Scripture expreſly aſſerts that it was his <hi>Pride</hi> that brought
him to it. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. He that is lifted up with Pride, <hi>falls into
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49412:277"/>
the Condemnation of the Devil.</hi> And in the general we are told by
the Prophet, <hi>Hab. 2. 4. That the Soul that is lifted up, cannot</hi> be
ſo <hi>upright</hi> as patiently to wait upon God in a way of <hi>believing,</hi> but
it will be preſuming to evade a trouble by <hi>indirect</hi> contrivances.</p>
                     <p>To explain the Obſervation, I ſhall do no more but ſhew what
Pride is, and how fit it is to beget Preſumption.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pride is a ſelf-idolizing, an over-valuation or admiration of our ſelves,
upon a real or ſuppoſed excellency, inward or outward, appertaining to
us.</hi> 'Tis in Scripture frequently expreſſed by the <hi>lifting</hi> up or <hi>exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
of the <hi>Soul.</hi> And this is done, upon the conſideration of any
kind of thing, which we apprehend makes us <hi>excel</hi> others; ſo that
<hi>inward gifts</hi> of Mind, as Knowledg, Humility, Courage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or
<hi>outward gifts</hi> of the Body, as Beauty, Strength, Activity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or
<hi>additional Advantages</hi> of Riches, Honour, Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or
any thing <hi>well done</hi> by us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may all be abuſed to beget and
nouriſh Pride, and to fill us with high and lofty thoughts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our ſelves: and being thus <hi>blown</hi> up, we are <hi>fitted</hi> for any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
undertaking. For.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Mind thus corrupted, begets to its ſelf apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a <hi>ſelf-ſufficiency:</hi> and therefore, as it is not apt to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
from what <hi>Fountain</hi> all thoſe Excellencies come, and to what
<hi>Ends</hi> they are to ſerve; ſo it brings them to a <hi>contempt</hi> of others,
and to a <hi>confidence</hi> of themſelves. Thus are Men by degrees ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated
by their own humour, that they mount up to irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
and abſurd conceits, fancying that they are more than they
are, and that they can do far more than is poſſible for them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh,
till at laſt they become apparently fooliſh in the purſuit
of their imaginations. I need not inſtance in the follies of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
who being elated in Mind, would be <hi>Jupiter's</hi> Son, and go
like <hi>Hercules</hi> in a Lyons Skin; or in the mad Frenzies of <hi>Caius,</hi>
who as he would need fancy himſelf a <hi>God,</hi> ſo would he <hi>change</hi> his
<hi>Godſhip</hi> when he pleaſed; to day he would wear a <hi>Lyons skin</hi> and
<hi>Club,</hi> and then he muſt be <hi>Hercules;</hi> to morrow in another Garb
he conceits himſelf <hi>Apollo;</hi> a <hi>Caduceus</hi> made him <hi>Mercury,</hi> a <hi>Sword</hi>
and <hi>Helmet</hi> made him <hi>Mars, &amp;c.</hi> Or in <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who would <hi>whip</hi>
the Seas, and fetter <hi>Neptune.</hi> The Scripture affords enough of this
nature, as the Boaſt of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar; Is not this great</hi> Babel <hi>that
I have built?</hi> In the Inſolency of <hi>Nineveh, Zeph. 2. 15. I am, and
there is none beſides me.</hi> The Blaſphemy of <hi>Tyre, Ezek.</hi> 28. 2. who
ſet her Heart, <hi>as the Heart of God, ſaying, I am a God, I ſit in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49412:277"/>
Seat of God.</hi> The arrogancy of <hi>Sennacherib, Eſa. 36. 19, 20. Where
are the Gods of</hi> Hamath—<hi>that the Lord ſhould deliver</hi> Jeruſalem
<hi>out of my hand?</hi> Though <hi>all</hi> Pride, in all Men <hi>ariſeth not</hi> to ſo
great an height of Madneſs, yet 'tis the <hi>nature</hi> of it, and none
have any of it, without this humour of <hi>conceiting themſelves above
themſelves,</hi> which ſtrangely prepares them for any Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He that is Proud, as he looks upon himſelf in a
<hi>flattering</hi> Glaſs, and meaſures himſelf by the <hi>length of his Shadow;</hi>
ſo doth he <hi>contemn</hi> and undervalue things, that lye before his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
as eaſy and ſmall, hence doth he put himſelf upon things
that are far beyond him. <hi>David</hi> notes the working of a proud
Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131. 1. in this particular, <hi>Neither do I exerciſe my ſelf
in great matters, or in things too high for me;</hi> Shewing that 'tis the
guize of Pride, to <hi>out-bid</hi> it ſelf in its attempts.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is not only forward to attempt, but alſo <hi>deſperate to
execute,</hi> without conſideration of hazard. Difficulty and Danger
when they ſtand in the way, ſhould uſually deter Men from their
enterprize; but Pride <hi>hardens</hi> the Heart, and in a blind rage en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth
it to <hi>contemn</hi> all inconveniencies; if Sin and the Breach of
Gods Law, be ſet before a Perſon, whoſe Pride engageth him to
an unlawful undertaking, he over-looks it as a thing of naught;
<hi>Through the Pride of his countenance he will not ſeek after God, God
is not in all his Thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 10. 4.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Pride ariſeth up to a <hi>ſcornful competition</hi> with any
thing that oppoſeth it; and the more 'tis oppoſed, the more it
rageth, for the conteſt is for having <hi>its Will.</hi> This was the Voice
of Pride in <hi>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord, that I ſhould ſerve him?</hi> Hence
Men are ſaid to <hi>deſpiſe the Commandments of God,</hi> when in the
ſtrength of their Pride they are carried on to an open conteſt for
their <hi>own ways</hi> and deſires, againſt peremptory <hi>Commands</hi> and
Threatnings.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Amabilis in ſania mentis gratiſſimus Error.</note> All this is done by a <hi>pleaſing allurement;</hi> 'tis a <hi>Witchcraft</hi>
that ſtrongly holds Men, and they think they are ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
if they be but gratified; though other things go to <hi>wrack,</hi>
yet they apprehend, if Credit and Honour be <hi>kept up</hi> 'tis enough.
<hi>Saul</hi> (when <hi>Samuel</hi> had declared that God would forſake him,
yet) ſought to pleaſe himſelf, by keeping up his Eſteem and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<hi>Honour me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>before the People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:49412:278"/>
If all theſe particulars be weighed, what preſumptuous act
can be propounded by Satan which Pride may not lead to? He
that ſwells himſelf to a conceit of <hi>abſoluteneſs,</hi> that will needs be
<hi>attempting</hi> things <hi>too high,</hi> that <hi>contemneth</hi> all hazards, and is made
more <hi>forward</hi> by oppoſition, and yet <hi>pleaſeth</hi> himſelf in all, as in
a <hi>Golden Dream,</hi> he is as much <hi>prepared</hi> for any <hi>figure</hi> or ſhape that
Satan is ready to <hi>impreſs</hi> upon him, as <hi>melted</hi> Metals for their
<hi>Mould</hi> or Stamp.</p>
                     <p>Hence muſt we be warned againſt <hi>Pride,</hi> as we would avoid
<hi>Preſumption;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Applic.</note> if we admit this, we cannot well eſcape the other.
And we are the more concerned to reſiſt Pride,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe 'tis a <hi>Natural</hi> Sin; it was the <hi>firſt</hi> Sin, and our
<hi>Natures</hi> are ſo deeply <hi>tainted</hi> with it, that it is a Sin that <hi>firſt</hi> ſhews
it ſelf in our <hi>Infancy:</hi> for Children will expreſs a Pride in their
Cloaths very early; and 'tis a <hi>general</hi> infection, from which none
are exempted in ſome degree or other. The Apoſtles Phraſe
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 16. ſhews that our whole life, and all the concerns
thereof, is but the <hi>Sphere</hi> in which Pride acts and therefore
whereas he reſtrains other luſts; to ſome particular <hi>ends,</hi> or pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<hi>Inſtruments,</hi> he calls this iniquity the <hi>Pride of Life,</hi> implying
how impoſſible it is to confine it in a narrow compaſs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is a <hi>ſubtile</hi> Sin, and <hi>often lyes</hi> where 'tis <hi>leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</hi>
Every man ſees it, as 'tis expreſt in <hi>haughty looks,</hi> in <hi>boaſting
Speeches,</hi> in <hi>gorgeous Apparel,</hi> in <hi>inſolent behaviour;</hi> but often Men
are <hi>inſenſibly</hi> poſſeſſed with this Sin and know not of it: under an
<hi>affected contempt</hi> of Honours and fine Clothes, they <hi>ſecretly</hi> hug
themſelves in their private conceits, and raiſe up in their own
thoughts <hi>Imaginary Trophies</hi> of Honour and Victory, for <hi>deſpiſing</hi>
what others ſo much dote upon. It was obſerved of <hi>Diogenes</hi> that
he did <hi>intus gloriari,</hi> inwardly boaſt, and with <hi>greater Pride</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
Honour, Riches, Plenty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than they were troubled
with, that enjoyed them. Some <hi>decry Pride</hi> in others, vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declare againſt it as a Sin, <hi>recommend Humility</hi> as an Ornament of
great price in the ſight of God, and yet are <hi>proud</hi> that they are
<hi>above</hi> others in a <hi>fancied Humility;</hi> and in the <hi>management</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their <hi>Reproofs</hi> and Exhortations, expreſs ſuch ſad <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi>
of an <hi>inſulting</hi> Humour, that the latent Pride of their Heart
doth appear by it. 'Tis poſſible for Men to give <hi>Thanks</hi> to the
<hi>Almighty</hi> for <hi>all</hi> they have, and yet to be <hi>Proud</hi> of what is in them:
the Phariſee was Proud, (for ſo Chriſt calls him) <hi>that he was not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49412:278"/>
as other Men,</hi> and yet he could <hi>thank</hi> God, as aſcribing all to him;
nay he that is <hi>truly ſenſible</hi> of the <hi>working</hi> of this Pride in himſelf,
and <hi>dares</hi> not approve it, yet he ſhall find in his Heart ſuch a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
when he is <hi>ſtroaked</hi> or praiſed, and when ſome <hi>Actions</hi> (praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy)
are <hi>not taken notice of,</hi> the beſt ſhall find that (without
great watchfulneſs) they ſhall not be <hi>able to hold</hi> from giving
ſome <hi>hints</hi> to others as a <hi>Memorial</hi> to them, of obſerving their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
or from ſome <hi>Inſinuations</hi> of their own Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Pride is a Sin no leſs <hi>dangerous</hi> then ſubtil; there are
no attempts ſo ſtrange, unreaſonable, monſtrous or abſurd, but it
may prompt to them. It was a ſtrange arrogancy in <hi>Herod</hi> to dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
himſelf in his own thoughts, and yet the acclamations of the
People ſwell'd him into ſuch a <hi>blaſphemous Imagination,</hi> that God
thought fit to chaſtiſe him, and inſtruct others by ſo dreadful a
Judgment, as clearly baffled his Inſolency, and made him and
his Flatterers confeſs, he was but a <hi>poor frail Man.</hi> Ordinarily
Pride is attended with a <hi>Judgment,</hi> 'tis the very <hi>Prognoſtick</hi> of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine;
<hi>Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an haughty Spirit before a Fall.
Prov.</hi> 16. 18. But theſe Judgments have ſomething in them <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi>
(which other Judgments for other Sins do not always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs)
to a manifeſtation of a <hi>ſpecial abhorrency</hi> in God againſt Pride;
as (1.) he commonly ſmites the <hi>thing for which</hi> they are Proud.
<hi>Staupitius</hi> boaſted of his Memory, and God ſmote it: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of his Treaſure, and for that God deſigned them for captivity:
<hi>David</hi> Glorifyed in the Multitude of his People, but God leſſened
them by Peſtilence. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is Proud of his <hi>Babel,</hi> and
God drave him from the enjoyment of it. Men are Proud of
<hi>Children</hi> or <hi>Relations,</hi> and God oft <hi>removes</hi> them, or makes them
a <hi>Shame</hi> and Sorrow. (2.) He doth not only this, but alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Judgment ſo that it ſhall bring a <hi>ſhame</hi> and contempt upon
Men in <hi>that thing</hi> wherein they <hi>prided</hi> themſelves; he will not
only <hi>puniſh,</hi> but alſo <hi>ſtain</hi> their Pride: the haughty Daughters of <hi>Sion</hi>
were not only plagued, by <hi>removing</hi> their Ornaments, Bracelets,
and the reſt of their Bravery,<note place="margin">Eſa. 3. 17, 24.</note> but over and above he <hi>ſmites with a
Scab, the crown of their Head, and diſcovers their ſecret parts, and
brings a Stink and Baldneſs upon them inſtead of a Sweet ſmell, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
Hair, and hurning inſtead of Beauty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So ſad a Diſtemper ſtands in need of a ſpecial Care: and for
that end we ſhould,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:49412:279"/>
Firſt, In all things we have or do not ſo much conſider what is
<hi>excellent,</hi> or wherein we excel, as what we <hi>have not,</hi> and wherein
we <hi>come ſhort.</hi> We ſhould be ſtrange to our ſelves, and deſign that
the <hi>right Hand ſhould not know what the left Hand doth;</hi> which muſt
be by having our Eye upon the <hi>Imperfections</hi> that attend us at the
beſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It muſt be our care to be <hi>ſuſpitious</hi> of the <hi>working</hi> of
Pride in us, and alſo by an induſtrious Watchfulneſs to give a <hi>ſtop</hi>
or <hi>check</hi> to thoughts of this nature when they <hi>ariſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Conqueſt of this cannot be expected without a
<hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>conſtant Labour</hi> herein. An humble Soul is compared by
<hi>David</hi> to a <hi>Weaned Child, Pſal.</hi> 131. 2. But a Child is not weaned
eaſily, <hi>Worm-wood</hi> muſt be laid on the Breaſt, and <hi>time</hi> allowed,
before the Child will forget it. He only that is content to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
a <hi>Diſcipline</hi> upon himſelf, and by frequent practices to <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituate</hi>
himſelf to <hi>low</hi> and <hi>careful</hi> Thoughts, is likely to overcome
it.</p>
                     <p>Pride (we have ſeen) was Satan's great Engine to bring on
Preſumption, the <hi>means</hi> by which he endeavoureth to beget Pride
(as was before noted:) were,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The conſideration of <hi>Priviledges,</hi> as being <hi>the Son of God.</hi>
For this expreſſion, <hi>[If thou art the Son of God]</hi> is now urged in
a Sence <hi>different</hi> from that which it had in the <hi>firſt</hi> Temptation;
there he propounded it as <hi>unlikely</hi> that he ſhould be the <hi>Son of God,</hi>
and yet be under ſuch a <hi>diſregard</hi> of Providence. In this ſenſe it
notably ſuited his <hi>deſign</hi> of drawing him to a <hi>diſtruſt</hi> of God's <hi>Care,</hi>
and conſequently of his Sonſhip. Here he is upon a <hi>contrary</hi> Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore propounds this, as a thing of which Chriſt
was <hi>aſſured,</hi> and from that Aſſurance he thus diſputes, <hi>Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt
thou art the Son of God, and doſt well depend on his care; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
needeſt thou not to diſtruſt thy preſervation, if thou caſteſt thy ſelf
down.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, To help his confidence forward to the undertaking,
he ſuggeſts what <hi>Credit</hi> and Honour it would be to him, in the
Sight of all the People to be ſo miraculouſly kept from hurt.
Hence note,</p>
                     <p>That Satan doth uſually kindle and nouriſh Pride,<note place="margin">Obſ. 11.</note> by a perverſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of our Priviledges.</p>
                     <p>It is very hard for Chriſtians to carry their Aſſurance <hi>even:</hi> not
but that Grace in its <hi>proper working</hi> begets Humility, and a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49412:279"/>
care againſt Sin and Folly, but ſuch is our <hi>Infirmity</hi> that we are
eaſily drawn to be <hi>Proud of our Mercies,</hi> and to perſwade our ſelves,
that we may make <hi>bold</hi> with God becauſe we are his <hi>Children.</hi>
Hence was that Paradox of Mr. <hi>Fox, That his Sins did him moſt
good, and his Graces moſt hurt;</hi> he means, Sins occaſioned his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
whereas his Graces were apt (through his weakneſs) to
make him Proud. And <hi>to hide this Pride from Man,</hi> God is forced
to keep them ſometime from the <hi>ſight</hi> of their Aſſurance, or to
<hi>diſcipline</hi> them by other <hi>Temptations,</hi> (as he did with <hi>Paul)</hi> leſt
they ſhould be <hi>exalted above meaſure.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>THe ways of Satan (hitherto inſiſted on) to engage Chriſt in

God, (though ſadly abuſed and miſrepreſented) <hi>He ſhall give his

which (as cited by him) we may eaſily ſee, (1.) That Satan af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
an <hi>Imitation</hi> of Chriſt, in the way of his reſiſtance; Chriſt
had urged Scripture before, and now Satan endeavours to manage
the ſame weapon againſt him. (2.) 'Tis obſervable that <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

and abuſe of it, as may be ſeen in theſe particulars: (1.) In
that he urged this <hi>promiſe</hi> to promote a <hi>ſinful</hi> thing, contrary to
the general end of all Scripture, which was therefore written <hi>that
we ſin not.</hi> (2.) But more eſpecially in his <hi>clipping</hi> and mutilating
of it; he induſtriouſly <hi>leaves out</hi> that part of it, which doth <hi>limit</hi>
and <hi>confine</hi> the promiſe of protection to <hi>lawful</hi> undertakings,

But 'tis evident that the Senſe of it is no more than this, <hi>God is

(not upon other terms) <hi>ſhalt thou walk in thy way ſafely.</hi>
The <hi>ways</hi> then in this promiſe, (cited by Satan) are the <hi>ways of

this dealing with Scripture is obvious, and Chriſt might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

by expreſſing a great many particulars of Gods ways and

<hi>Mockery</hi> and Scorn, partly upon <hi>other grounds</hi> of advantage to his
intendments, doth counterfeit the <hi>currant Coin</hi> of the Lords <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments</hi>

he ſignified his mind in <hi>divers manners by the Prophets,</hi> and
<hi>in theſe laſt days by his Son,</hi> in all which we ſhall trace the ſteps of
Satan.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, God revealed himſelf ſometime by <hi>Voice,</hi> as to <hi>Abraham,
Moſes</hi> and others: the Devil hath dared to imitate this. There
want not inſtances of it in the Temptation, which is now under

                        <hi>Sprengar</hi> tells us a Story of the Devils
<hi>Preaching</hi> to a Congregation in the Habit and Likeneſs of a Prieſt,
wherein he <hi>reproved</hi> Sin, and urged Truth, and ſeemed no way
<hi>culpable</hi> for falſe Doctrine, but I ſuſpect this for a <hi>fabulous tale:</hi>
however it is undenyable that he ſometime hath appeared to Men

                     <p>Secondly, God hath ſometime revealed himſelf to Men in <hi>Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi>

pretending that at ſuch times, he was in an <hi>Extaſy,</hi> and had
converſe with the <hi>Angel Gabriel.</hi> But what he only in <hi>knavery</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
others have <hi>really</hi> felt: the Stories of <hi>Familiſts,</hi> and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Quakers</hi> are full of ſuch things; they frequently have fallen
down, and have lain as in a Swoon, and when they have awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
told wonderful Stories of what they have heard and
ſeen.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Viſions</hi> and Dreams were uſual things in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
and famous ways of Divine Revelation: but Satan was
not behind in this matter, his Inſtruments had their <hi>Viſions</hi> too:
in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 7. we have mention of <hi>Vain-Viſions,</hi> and <hi>Lying-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations;</hi>
and ſuch Satanical Dreams are alſo noted, <hi>Deut. 13. 1.
If there ariſe among you a Dreamer of Dreams.</hi> Thoſe days of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that are not yet out of memory, afforded ſtore of theſe: while
unſtable <hi>giddy-headed</hi> People began to dote on <hi>Novelties</hi> and Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
in Religion, they gave opportunity to Satan to <hi>beguile</hi> them;
for he taking advantage of their <hi>nauſeating</hi> of <hi>old</hi> Truths, and their
expectation of <hi>ſublime diſcoveries,</hi> (which had ſufficiently prepared
them for any Impreſſion) did ſo over-work their Fancies, that
they eaſily conceited themſelves, to have had <hi>Divine Revelations;</hi>
and nothing was more ordinary than to hear Stories of <hi>Viſions</hi> and
<hi>Dreams.</hi> And this ſpread further by a kind of <hi>Infection,</hi> for it grew
into a <hi>Religious Faſhion;</hi> and he was not eſteemed, that had not
ſomething of this nature to <hi>Experience.</hi> And though the Folly
and <hi>Impertinencies</hi> of ſuch things generally (and ſometime the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
wickedneſs</hi> of them, as contradicting <hi>Truth,</hi> and the Divine
rules of <hi>Holineſs)</hi> were <hi>ſufficient diſcoveries,</hi> that Satans hand was
in them: yet until <hi>Time, Experience,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of God had
<hi>cooled</hi> the intemperate heat of this <hi>raving</hi> Humor, it continued in
the <hi>good liking</hi> and admiration of the more <hi>inconſiderate Vulgar.</hi> And
ſometime thoſe from whom more <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> and conſideration
might have been expected, fell into a <hi>reverence</hi> for theſe pretences
in others, and <hi>helped</hi> forward this <hi>Spiritual Witchcraft</hi> by their
countenance and arguings, often abuſing that Text in <hi>Acts 2. 17.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49412:282"/>
Your Young Men ſhall ſee Viſions, and your old Men ſhall dream Dreams,</hi>
by applying it to a juſtification of theſe apparently fooliſh dota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
And indeed the effect hath diſcovered they were no better:
for many of thoſe things which with great confidence were <hi>avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
as <hi>certain,</hi> were by <hi>time</hi> proved to be <hi>falſe;</hi> many things were
<hi>uſeleſs, vain, ridiculous,</hi> and ſome were brought to lament and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
their folly after they proceeded far in theſe ways; and at laſt,
(when the former opportunities are worn out) Satan grew
<hi>weary</hi> of that deſign, (as being no longer proper to be inſiſted on)
there is now a great calm, ſo that 'tis but ſeldom that we hear of
ſuch things talked of; it were needleſs to give particular inſtances,
when you may at your leiſure fetch them from hundreds of Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
commonly known.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, One of the moſt noted ways by which God diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
his Mind was that of <hi>inſpiration,</hi> by which ſome eminent
Perſons, (called therefore Prophets) ſpake the Will of God, <hi>as
they were moved</hi> or acted <hi>by the Spirit of God.</hi> The Devil had
alſo his <hi>falſe</hi> Prophets, ſuch are frequently taxed in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
and foretold in the New. <hi>Falſe Chriſts; and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſhall ariſe,</hi> Mat. 24. 24. <hi>There were falſe Prophets among the
People, as there ſhall be falſe Teachers among you,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1. Many
falſe Teachers are gone out into the World. Such an one was
<hi>Montanus</hi> in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, <hi>David George, John</hi> of <hi>Leyden, Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
our Country-Man were ſuch, and a great many ſuch there
have been in all ages; 'tis notoriouſly known that Satan hath thus
inſpired poor <hi>poſſeſſed wretches</hi> who have uttered <hi>threatnings</hi> againſt
Sin, and wo to Sinners. The <hi>ſayings</hi> of ſuch poſſeſſed Creatures
have not long ſince been gathered into a <hi>Volume</hi> and publiſhed,<note place="margin">Jean D'Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne <hi>popular Errors</hi> p. 76.</note> as
containing very <hi>perſwaſive Arguments</hi> to Repentance, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Life. Beſides theſe, our own times afford too many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of this kind, many have put on the <hi>Guiſe</hi> of the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
in a fooliſh (though adventurous) imitation of their Actions
and Prophecies. Some have in our Streets reſembled <hi>Jonah</hi> in
<hi>Nineveh, Yet forty days,</hi> &amp;c. Some fancied to walk <hi>naked</hi> like <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah;</hi>
others have come with their <hi>Earthen Pitchers</hi> and broken them:
imitating theſe and other <hi>Types</hi> by which God in his true Prophets
foreſignifyed his judgments to come; in all which Actions and
Garbes with much earneſtneſs, and in an <hi>Affected Tone</hi> they have
called out for Repentance, in a confident denunciation of Woes
and Miſeries, with a bold limiting of the time of <hi>forty days</hi> (that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49412:282"/>
the ſame might carry a Parallel to <hi>Jonah's</hi> Prophecy) and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
giving (which is the ſureſt way) an unlimited uncertain
time. How the Devil acts in theſe matters, and by what ways
he ſeduceth them to believe they are inſpired of God, or have real
Viſions and Revelations, 'tis not my buſineſs now to enquire, only
let thoſe that think ſuch things ſtrange, conſider that the Devil
hath the advantage of <hi>deep fanciful apprehenſions,</hi> and a <hi>working Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy</hi>
in ſuch Perſons, by which he can eaſily work them to <hi>conceit</hi>
any thing, and confidently to <hi>believe</hi> what they have conceited.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Sometime God notifyed his Mind by <hi>Signs</hi> and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
Satan hath alſo his <hi>Lying Signs and Wonders;</hi> a Power God
hath permitted him this way, which is very great, and the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
wrought thereby are <hi>ſtrong,</hi> hazarding the deception of the
<hi>Elect.</hi> This Power of doing Wonders the Devil uſually applies to
<hi>falſe Doctrines,</hi> to ſtrengthen and countenance Errors; the Apoſtle
teſtifies 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 9. that Satan ſhall imploy this power for the
advancement of the <hi>Man of Sin, whoſe coming ſhall be with Signs
and lying Wonders.</hi> The Beaſt ariſing out of the Earth, <hi>Rev. 13. 14.
he ſhall deceive by the means of thoſe Miracles which he hath Power to do.</hi>
And accordingly the Popiſh Legends are full of Stories of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
whereof (though moſt be Lyes, Forgeries, and the falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivements
of thoſe who ſought to bring the People to receive their
Doctrines, the credit and advancement of which they ſought by
ſuch ways;) ſome notwithſtanding (though not <hi>true</hi> Miracles)
yet were <hi>truly acted,</hi> to countenance thoſe Errors which are preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be eſtabliſhed by them.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, God doth teach and lead his People by <hi>Impulſes.</hi> Chriſt
was thus <hi>led of the Spirit into the Wilderneſs;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>bound
in Spirit to go to Jeruſalem.</hi> 'Tis common for Satan to imitate ſuch
Impulſes. We have clear Inſtances of Diabolical <hi>Impulſes</hi> to <hi>Sin</hi>
in Scripture; a ſtrong Impulſe was on <hi>Ananias,</hi> Satan <hi>filled his heart;</hi>
a ſtrong Impulſe on <hi>Judas,</hi> Satan <hi>entred into his Heart;</hi>
and what then more eaſy to apprehend, than that Satan can
counterfeit better Impulſes, and violently ſtir up the Hearts of Men
to actions ſeemingly good or indifferent. Some Hypocrites are
<hi>moved ſtrongly</hi> to Pray or Preach, (Satan therein aiming at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Pride or Preſumption in them;) and they know no other,
but that it is the Spirit of God. God's Children may have <hi>Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
from Satan, upon pretences of <hi>Zeal</hi> as the Diſciples had, when
they called for <hi>Fire from Heaven.</hi> In theſe Impulſes Satan doth
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49412:283"/>
not ſo act the Heart of Man as the Spirit of God doth, whoſe
Commands in this caſe are <hi>irreſiſtible,</hi> but he only works by <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the diſpoſition of our Bodies in a Natural way;</hi> and then having
<hi>ſitted</hi> us all he can for an <hi>Impreſſion,</hi> he endeavours to <hi>ſet it on</hi> by
<hi>ſtrong</hi> perſwaſions. Some memorable inſtances of theſe Impulſes
might profitably illuſtrate this. <hi>Math. Pariſienſis</hi> takes notice of a
Boy,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Holy War.</hi> l. 3. cap. 24.</note> in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1213. (of whom alſo <hi>Fuller</hi> makes mention) who
(after ſome loſs which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had received in the War
againſt the <hi>Turks)</hi> went up and down, Singing this Rithme.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Jeſus Lord, Redeem our Loſs:</l>
                        <l>Reſtore to us thy Holy Croſs.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>And by this means he gathered a Multitude of Boys together, who
could not by the ſevereſt <hi>Menaces</hi> of their Parents be hindred from
following him,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Wars of the</hi> Jews, lib. 7. c. 13.</note> to their own ruine. Another inſtance of a <hi>ſtrange</hi>
Impulſe, we have in <hi>Joſephus;</hi> one <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Ananus,</hi> about
four years before the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at the Feaſt of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,</hi>
begins to cry out <hi>Woe, Woe, to the Eaſt and Weſt, to Man
and Woman,</hi> &amp;c. And could by no means be reſtrained Night or
Day; and when his Fleſh was beaten off his Bones, he begged no
pity nor eaſe, but ſtill continued his uſual crying.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, God doth alſo by his Spirit teach his People in <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things to their remembrance.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 26.</note> Satan alſo in imitation of this, can
put into the Minds of Men (with great readineſs and dexterity)
<hi>Promiſes,</hi> or <hi>Sentences</hi> of Scripture, inſomuch that they conclude
that all ſuch actings are from the Spirit of God, who (as they
conclude) ſet ſuch a Scripture upon their Heart: thus dealt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
with Chriſt, he urgeth the Promiſe upon him, wherein up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the matter he doth as much, as when he ſecretly ſuggeſts ſuch
things to the Heart without an audible Voice. In this way of
<hi>craft</hi> Satan doth very much <hi>reſemble</hi> the <hi>true</hi> work of the Spirit,
(1.) In the <hi>readineſs</hi> and quickneſs of ſuggeſting; (2.) In ſeeming
<hi>exact ſuiting</hi> Scripture ſuggeſted, with the preſent occaſion; and
(3.) In the <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> of his urging it upon the Fancies of Men.
Yet when all this is done, they that ſhall ſeriouſly conſider all ends,
Matter and Circumſtances, will eaſily obſerve it is but the cunning
work of a Tempter, and not from the Holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerve alſo,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 14.</note> That whatever be the various ways of Satans imitation,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49412:283"/>
yet the matter which he works and practiſeth upon, is ſtill Scripture: to
this he confines himſelf;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Scriptures are generally (among Chriſtians)
received as the <hi>undoubted Oracles</hi> of God, the <hi>Rule</hi> of our Lives and
Duties, and the <hi>Grounds</hi> of our hope. It would be a vain and
bootleſs labour to impoſe upon thoſe that retain this belief, the
ſayings of the <hi>Turkiſh Alcoran,</hi> the Precepts of Heathen <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
or any other thing that may carry a viſible <hi>eſtrangement</hi> from
or <hi>contradiction</hi> to Scripture, he could not then poſſibly pretend to
a <hi>Divine Inſtruction,</hi> nor could he ſo <hi>transform himſelf into an Angel
of Light:</hi> but by uſing this covert of Divine Command, Promiſe,
or Diſcovery, he can more eaſily beget a belief, that <hi>God hath ſaid
it,</hi> and that there is neither Sin nor Danger in the thing propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but Duty and Advantage to be expected; and this is the very
thing that makes way for an eaſy entertainment of ſuch deluſions.
Poor Creatures believe that is all <hi>from God,</hi> and that they are <hi>acted by
his Spirit,</hi> and that with ſuch confidence that they <hi>contemn</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry</hi>
thoſe (as ignorant of <hi>Divine Myſteries,</hi> and of the Power of
God) who are not ſo <hi>beſotted</hi> as themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Scriptures have a Glorious <hi>irreſiſtible Majeſty</hi> in
them peculiar to themſelves, which cannot be found in all that
<hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Eloquence</hi> can contribute to other <hi>Authors.</hi> 'Tis not <hi>Play-Book
Language,</hi> nor <hi>Scraps</hi> of <hi>Romances</hi> that Satan can effect theſe <hi>cheats</hi>
withal; and therefore we may obſerve that in the <hi>higheſt</hi> deluſions
Men have had <hi>pretences</hi> of Scripture, and their ſtrong perſwaſions
of <hi>extraordinary</hi> diſcoveries, have ſtriken Men into a <hi>reverence</hi> of
their profeſſion, becauſe of the Scripture Words and Phraſes, with
which their boldeſt follies are woven up: for let but Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the <hi>reaſon</hi> of the prevalency of <hi>Familiſm</hi> of old, upon
ſo vaſt a number of People as were carried away with it, and
they ſhall find, that the great <hi>Artifice</hi> lay in the <hi>Words</hi> they uſed,
a language <hi>abſtracted</hi> from Scripture, to ſignify ſuch <hi>conceits</hi> as the
Scripture never intended. Hence were their expreſſions always
<hi>high, ſoaring,</hi> and relating to a more excellent and <hi>myſtical inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi>
of thoſe <hi>Divine Writings.</hi> This may be obſerved in
<hi>David George, Hen. Nicholas</hi> and others, who uſually talk of being
<hi>conſubſtantiated</hi> with God, <hi>taken up into his Love, of the Angelical
Life,</hi> and a great deal more of the ſame kind. The <hi>Ranters</hi> at
firſt had the like Language, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> after them, affected

they are ſaid to be <hi>transformed into the Apoſtles of Chriſt,</hi> and to the

                     <p>Secondly, He makes <hi>abuſed</hi> Scripture to <hi>encourage</hi> ſinful Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
he can cite paſſages of God's <hi>Patience</hi> and long-ſuffering, of
his <hi>pardoning Grace,</hi> and readineſs to forgive, and a thouſand more
upon no other deſign, than the <hi>turning of the Grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs.</hi>
When Profeſſors turn looſe and negligent, when they
adventure too far upon ſinful pleaſures, they <hi>lick</hi> themſelves <hi>whole,</hi>
by an overforward <hi>graſping</hi> at ſuch paſſages of Scripture, which
Satan will, with great readineſs, ſet upon their hearts, and then
they pretend to themſelves that their peace is made up with God,
and that they have no leſs than a <hi>ſealed Pardon</hi> in their Boſomes;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49412:284"/>
which notwithſtanding may be known to have <hi>only</hi> Satans <hi>Hand

                     <p>Laſtly, This way of Satans ſetting home Scriptures, proves
ſadly effectual to beget or heighten the <hi>inward diſtreſſes</hi> and fears of
the Children of God. 'Tis a wonder to hear ſome diſpute againſt

things to their own prejudice. And ſometimes a Scripture will be
ſet ſo <hi>Croſs</hi> or <hi>edg-way</hi> to their Good and Comfort, that many
Pleadings, much time, Prayers, and Diſcourſes cannot remove it.
I have known ſome that have ſeriouſly profeſſed, Scriptures have

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, To <hi>deal faithfully,</hi> in urging Scriptures upon the
Conſciences of Men, is alſo contrary to his Intereſt; he hath a
Kingdom which he endeavours to uphold. This Kingdom being
directly contrary to that of Chriſt's, (which is a Kingdom of <hi>Light)</hi>
is therefore called a Kingdom of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> being <hi>maintained</hi> and
propagated only by <hi>Lies</hi> and Deceits. He cannot then be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to uſe Scripture faithfully, becauſe that is the true Scepter of
<hi>Chriſt's Kingdom,</hi> for then ſhould Satan (as Chriſt argues <hi>Mat. 12.

                     </p>
                     <p>This unfaithful dealing with Scripture is <hi>threefold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, The unfaithfulneſs of his <hi>Deſign,</hi> though he ſpeaks what
is true, yet he doth it with an <hi>evil Mind,</hi> aiming at one of theſe
<hi>three</hi> things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To <hi>Deceive</hi> and Delude. If he applies <hi>Promiſes,</hi> or inſiſts
upon the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of God's Children, it is to make them <hi>Proud</hi>
or Preſumptuous; if he urge <hi>Threatnings,</hi> or ſtir up the Conſcience
to accuſe for Sin, 'tis to bring them to <hi>diſpair;</hi> if he object the <hi>Law,</hi>
'tis to <hi>enrage</hi> Luſt; and that <hi>Sin by the Commandment might become
exceeding ſinful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, His Deſign is ſometime to bring the Scripture under
<hi>Suſpition</hi> or <hi>Contempt;</hi> he puts ſome weak Chriſtians upon <hi>unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
or Imprudent</hi> uſe of Scripture, and then tempts others to <hi>laugh</hi>
at them, and to diſpiſen in their Hearts thoſe ways of Religion,
which ſome Zealots with too much weakneſs do manage. Men
are apt enough to ſcoffat the moſt ſerious and weighty Duties of
Holineſs, even when performed in a moſt ſerious manner. If
<hi>David</hi> put on <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> and afflict himſelf with Faſting, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<hi>turned to his reproach,</hi> and <hi>the Drunkards make a Song of it;</hi>
but much more advantage hath the Devil to raiſe up ſcorn and
loathing in the Minds of debauched Perſons, by the <hi>affected</hi> and
<hi>unskilful</hi> uſe of Scripture. Some by a narrow confinement of the
words <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>Siſter</hi> to thoſe of their own <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> (as if none
elſe were to be owned by them) have occaſioned the ſcoff of <hi>Holy
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49412:285"/>
Brethren,</hi> (a Phraſe notwithſtanding uſed with a <hi>grave ſeriouſneſs</hi>
by the Apoſtle) in the uſual Diſcourſes of thoſe, who wait all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
to harden themſelves againſt the Power of Religion. The
like Obſervations they make of other ways and forms of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which ſome have accuſtomed themſelves unto, in a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
conformity to Scripture phraſe: in all which the Devil ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the <hi>weakneſs</hi> and injudiciouſneſs of ſome on the one hand,
and the <hi>ſcornful</hi> Pride of others on the other hand;
is willing to provide matter for their <hi>Atheiſtical jears,</hi> by putting
all the Obligations he can upon the Conſciences of the weak, to
continue in the <hi>uſe of</hi> theſe Expreſſions. For ſome proof of this
matter, we may note the ſecret Deceit of Satan, in that liberal
profeſſion of Chriſt to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> Mark 1. 24. Luke 4. 34.
<hi>I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God:</hi> here was Truth ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by him, and (one would have thought) with great Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
but yet he cunningly inſinuated into the Minds of the Hearers
a ground of Suſpition, that he was not the Son of God; and for
that end calls him <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> as if Chriſt had been born
there; he knew well that the <hi>Jews</hi> expected no <hi>Meſſiah</hi> from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi>
and therefore on ſet purpoſe uſed he that Expreſſion, that
he might draw him into contempt. And accordingly we find this
very miſtake (that Chriſt was born at <hi>Nazareth)</hi> became an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
againſt him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 41. while ſome were convinced and
ſaid, <hi>This is the Chriſt,</hi> others ſaid, <hi>ſhall Chriſt come out of</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Another part of his Deſign in the uſe of Scriptures, is
to put a <hi>Varniſh upon Hypocriſy.</hi> He is ready to ſerve Men by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Scripture <hi>Expreſſions</hi> in their <hi>Mouths,</hi> and <hi>inuring</hi> them to a
conſtant uſe of the <hi>phraſes</hi> of thoſe Divine Writings, that they
may <hi>leſs ſuſpect</hi> themſelves of the Pride, Formality and ſecret wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
of their Hearts; and to help on their miſtakes concerning
their Spiritual Condition, he can urge upon their Conſciences
thoſe Scriptures that ſerve to engage them in <hi>external</hi> Obſervances
of Religion.<note place="margin">Luke 18. 11.</note> It may appear by the Phariſees boaſt of Faſting <hi>twice
a Week,</hi> of <hi>paying Tythes,</hi> of <hi>giving Alms,</hi> that their Conſciences
were ſome way concerned in theſe things, ſo that though they
were left without check of Conſcience, to <hi>devour Widows Houſes,</hi>
yet were they urged to make <hi>long Prayers.</hi> Suitable to this is that
which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of the Harlot, who to colour over her Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
had her <hi>Offerings</hi> and <hi>Vows,</hi> and when her Conſcience is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49412:286"/>
appeaſed with theſe performances, ſhe can excuſe her ſelf in her
way of ſinning, <hi>She eats and wipes her Mouth, and ſaith, I have done
no wickedneſs,</hi> Prov. 30. 20. Satan doth but hereby help to <hi>paint</hi> a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,</hi>
or <hi>guild</hi> a <hi>Potſheard,</hi> and to furniſh Men with Excuſes and
Pretexts in their way of ſinning. Not unlike to this was that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which the Devil with great readineſs performed (as I was
informed from ſome of good credit) to a young Student, who
had faln upon ſome Books of <hi>Magick</hi> in a <hi>Colledg</hi>-Library, into
which having ſtoln privately one Night in purſuit of that Study,
was almoſt ſurpriſed by the <hi>Preſident;</hi> who ſeeing a Candle there
at an unſeaſonable time, ſuddenly opens the Door to know who
was up ſo late, in which ſtrait the Devil (to gratify his <hi>Pupil</hi> with
a ready excuſe) <hi>ſnatcheth</hi> away his Book, and in a moment lays
<hi>Montanus</hi> his Bible before him, that he might pretend that for his
imployment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Another point of Satan's unfaithful dealing with
Scripture, is his <hi>falſecitation</hi> of it; 'tis nothing with him to <hi>alter,
change,</hi> or <hi>leave</hi> out ſuch a part as may make againſt him. If he
urge <hi>Promiſes</hi> upon Men, in order to their Security and Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
he <hi>conceals the Condition of them,</hi> and <hi>banniſheth</hi> the <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
far from their Minds, repreſenting the Mercy of God in a falſe
Glaſs, as if he had promiſed to ſave and bring to Heaven every
Man upon the common and eaſy <hi>tearms</hi> of being <hi>called</hi> a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
If it be his purpoſe to diſquiet the Hearts of God's Children,
to promote their fears, or to lead them to diſpair, then he <hi>ſets
home</hi> the <hi>Commands</hi> and <hi>Threatnings,</hi> but <hi>hides the Promiſes</hi> that
might relieve them, and (which is remarkable) he hath ſo puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſome, by ſetting on their Hearts a piece of Scripture, that
when the <hi>next words,</hi> or <hi>next verſe,</hi> might have <hi>eaſed</hi> them of their
Fears, and <hi>anſwered</hi> the ſad Objections which they raiſed againſt
themſelves from thence; (as if their Eyes had been holden, or as if
a miſt had been caſt over them) they have not for a long time been
<hi>able</hi> to conſider the <hi>relief</hi> which they might have had. This <hi>hiding</hi>
of Scripture from their Eyes, (ſetting aſide what God may do
for the juſt chaſtiſement of his Childrens Folly) is effected, by
the <hi>ſtrong Impreſſion</hi> which Satan ſets upon their Hearts, and by
<hi>holding</hi> their Minds <hi>down</hi> to a <hi>fixed Meditation</hi> of the dreadful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
which he <hi>preſents</hi> to them from thence, not ſuffering
them to <hi>divert</hi> their Thoughts by his inceſſant <hi>Clamours</hi> againſt
them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:49412:286"/>
Thirdly, He unfaithfully handleth Scriptures, by <hi>wreſting</hi> the true
Import and Senſe of them. We read of ſome, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. who
<hi>wreſt the Scripture,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> the word in the Original ſignifies a <hi>racking</hi> or
torturing of it, as Men upon a Rack are ſtretched beyond their
due length, to a diſlocation of their joints, and ſometimes forced
to ſpake what they never did nor intended; ſo are the Scriptures
uſed. Thoſe that do ſo are Satan's Scholars, and taught of him,
(though in regard of the Spirits <hi>true</hi> teaching, they are called <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned)</hi>
which is ſufficient to ſhew Satan's deceitful dealing: he
often lays his dead and corrupt Senſe (as the Harlot did with her
dead Child in the room of the living Infant) in the place of the
living meaning of the Scripture: this may be ſeen evidently,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In <hi>Hereſies</hi> or Errors, theſe are Satans Brood, and there
are none ſo vile (that pretend to Chriſtian Religion) but they
claima kindred to Scripture, and are confident on its Authority
for them. Now ſeeing Truth is but <hi>one,</hi> and theſe Errors not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contradictory to <hi>Truth,</hi> but to <hi>each</hi> other, Satan could never
ſpin out ſuch concluſions from the Divine <hi>Oracles,</hi> but by wreſting
them from their true intendments; and he that would contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
the great Subtilty of Satan in this his Art, need but conſider
what different ſtrange and monſtrous ſhapes are put upon the
Scripture, by the ſeveral Hereſies which march under its Colours.
The <hi>Quakers</hi> in their way repreſent it like an <hi>old Almanack</hi> out of
date, and withal in the uſe <hi>they make</hi> of it, they render it as a
piece of <hi>nonſenſical</hi> furious roving. The <hi>Socinians</hi> take down
the ſublime Myſteries of Chriſts ſatisfaction, and Juſtification by
Faith, with External Rewards and Puniſhments, to a ſtrain as low
as the <hi>Turkiſh Alcoran.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> make it like a few leaves of
an imperfect Book, wanting Beginning and End, and ſo not fit
to be ſet up as a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Rule. The <hi>Ranters</hi> make it ſeem rather like
Language from <hi>Hell,</hi> than the Commands of the Pure and Holy
God. Some will have it to countenance moſt <hi>ridiculous inventions</hi>
in Worſhip, others will have it to diſcharge all <hi>outward obſervations</hi>
and Ordinances, as Childiſh Rudiments. Some raiſe it all to
the pitch of <hi>Aenigmatical</hi> unintelligible Myſteries; Others can
find no more in the precepts of it than in <hi>Ariſtotles Ethicks.</hi>
Thus by diſtorting and wreſting, Satan hath learn'd theſe
unskilful Ones to make it ſerve their vileſt Luſts and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:49412:287"/>
Secondly, The ſame Art of wreſting Scripture is obſervable in
his <hi>ſecret Suggeſtions.</hi> If he would encourage any in Sin, he can
Wreſt Scripture for that, and tell him that God is Merciful, that
Chriſt died for Sinners, that there is hope of Pardon, that Saints
have done the like; things very true in themſelves, but perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him to another ſenſe than ever they were intended to by
God, who hath ſpoken theſe things that we ſin not. If he
would <hi>diſcourage</hi> a Saint, he can tell him when he finds him doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his eſtate, that the <hi>fearful and unbelieving have their part in the
Lake which burns with Fire and Brimſtone;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 8.</note> when he finds him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a <hi>known</hi> Sin, he tells that of the Apoſtle, <hi>If we ſin willfully
after we have received the knowldg of the Truth, there remains no more
Sacrifice for Sins.</hi> When he obſerves them <hi>diſcompoſed</hi> and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
in Duty, then he objects, <hi>They draw nigh me with their Lips,
but their Heart is far from me.</hi> If he ſees them <hi>dull</hi> and without
Conſolation at the Lord's Supper, then to be ſure they hear of
him;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>he that eats and drinks unworthily, eateth and drinketh Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to himſelf.</hi> If he find him <hi>bemoaning</hi> that he is not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
of Mercies or Judgments, as he would be, then he ſets
home ſome ſuch Scripture as this, <hi>This Peoples Heart is waxed groſs,
and their Ears are dull of hearing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 15.</note> &amp;c. Theſe Scriptures are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
perverted by Satan from the true and proper meaning of
them. I have had complaints from ſeveral dejected Chriſtians, of
theſe very Scriptures urged upon them to their great trouble, when
yet it was evident, that none of theſe were truly applyed by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
Temptation againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things give us warning not to take any thing of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon <hi>truſt.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Applic.</note> If Satan can ſo imitate the Spirit of God in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
of Scripture, and bringing it to our remembrance, we
have great reaſon to beware leſt we be impoſed upon by Satan's
Deſign clothed in Scripture Phraſe; not that I would have Men
eſteem the ſecret ſetting of Scripture upon their Minds, to be in
all caſes a <hi>deluſion,</hi> and to be diſregarded as ſuch. Some indeed
there are that ſo <hi>ſeverely</hi> remark the weakneſſes of Profeſſors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that they raiſe up a <hi>ſcorn</hi> to that which is of moſt neceſſary
and ſerious uſe: becauſe the Devil prevails with ſome <hi>Hypocrites</hi> to
guild themſelves with Scripture phraſe, and others through <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
inadvertency,</hi> are (unknown to themſelves) beguiled by
Satan, to miſapplications of Scripture to their own eſtate, or to
other things; they therefore decry all the <hi>inward workings</hi> of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49412:287"/>
Heart, as <hi>Fancy,</hi> or affected <hi>ſingularity:</hi> theſe do but the Devils
work. But that the Spirit of God (whom Satan treacherouſly
endeavours to imitate) doth <hi>ſet home</hi> Scripture Commands,
Threatnings and Promiſes upon the Hearts of his People, is not
only atteſted by the <hi>Experience</hi> of all that are inwardly acquainted
with the ways of God, but is one of the great Promiſes which
Chriſt hath given for the comfort of his People in his abſence.
Joh. 14. 26. <hi>But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the
Father ſhall ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring
all things to your remembrance whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> This
then being granted as a firm unſhaken Truth, our care muſt be in
diſcovering and avoiding Satan's counterfeit uſing of Scripture,
and in this we ſhould be more wary;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe we are not ſo apt to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> what we meet
with in ſuch a way, when 'tis brought to us in the <hi>Language</hi> of
Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, And thoſe that are <hi>not exerciſed</hi> in the Scripture, will

which is the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and all muſt be tryed by that: ſo that if
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49412:288"/>
there be <hi>Impulſes,</hi> or <hi>Diſcoveries,</hi> or <hi>Remembrances</hi> of Scripture upon
any, it muſt not be taken for <hi>granted</hi> that they are of God, becauſe
they <hi>pretend</hi> ſo high, (for ſo we ſhall make Satan Judg in his own
Cauſe) but lay all to the <hi>Line and Plummet</hi> of the written Word,
and if it anſwer not that, call it confidently a deluſion,
and reject it as <hi>accurſed,</hi> though it might ſeem (in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     </p>
                     <p>But it will be ſaid,<note place="margin">Object.</note> Satan pretends to this Rule, and it is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Compare</hi> the Inference of the ſuggeſtion with <hi>other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
If it be from a <hi>dark</hi> Scripture, compare it with thoſe that
are more <hi>plain,</hi> and in every caſe, ſee whether the <hi>general Current</hi>
of the Scriptures ſpeak the ſame thing:<note place="margin">Though it was Scripture that Satan urged to Chriſt, yet he rejects his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as falſe becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to other plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not, to tempt the Lord.</note> for if it be from Satan, he

<hi>Impertinent,</hi> or (which is moſt uſual) <hi>contrary</hi> to Truth or Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
if any of theſe appear, by a true <hi>examination</hi> of the <hi>Import</hi>
of the Scripture which he ſeeks to abuſe, or by <hi>comparing</hi> it
with the <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>Genius</hi> of other Scriptures, you may
certainly pronounce that it is not of God, but Satan's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Conſider the <hi>tendency</hi> of ſuch Suggeſtions: Let no
Man ſay that this will come <hi>too late,</hi> or that it is an <hi>after game:</hi> I
do not mean that we ſhould ſtay ſo long, as to ſee the Effects;
(though this is alſo a certain diſcovery of Satan's knavery in his
higheſt pretences; the Phanatick Furies of the <hi>German Enthuſiaſts</hi>
do now appear plain to all the World to have been <hi>Deluſions,</hi> by
their <hi>End, Fruits,</hi> and <hi>Iſſue)</hi> But that <hi>while</hi> theſe Concluſions
are <hi>obtruded</hi> upon us, we ſhould obſerve to what they <hi>tend:</hi> which
we ſhall the better know, if all <hi>Circumſtances</hi> round about be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.
Sometimes Satan doth covertly <hi>hint</hi> his Mind, and ſend
it along with the ſuggeſtion; ſometimes our <hi>condition</hi> will enough
declare it, and there is no caſe but it will afford ſomething of <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi>
if ſeriouſly pondered. If he either prompt us to Pride,
Vain-Glory, or Preſumption, or that our condition ſway us that
way, it will be ſufficient ground of Suſpition that 'tis Satan that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49412:288"/>
then urgeth Promiſes or Priviledges upon us. If we are of a
wounded Spirit inclined to Diſtruſt, or if we be put on to deſpair,
it is paſt denyal, that 'tis Satan that urgeth the Threatnings, and
preſſeth the Accuſations of the Law againſt us. He that <hi>gathers</hi>
Stones, Timber, Lime, and ſuch Materials together, as are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
imployed in Building, doth diſcover his <hi>intention,</hi> before he
actually Build his Houſe, and thus may Satan's <hi>End</hi> be known by

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It muſt be remembred that <hi>with</hi> theſe endeavours,
we often <hi>ſeek</hi> the Face of the Lord for help and Counſel; and that
we <hi>apply</hi> our ſelves to ſuch of the Servants of God, as being <hi>more
knowing</hi> than our ſelves, and <hi>leſs prepoſſeſſed</hi> in their Judgments
(becauſe not concerned) are <hi>better</hi> able to ſee into the Nature of
our Straits, and to help us by their Advices.</p>

                     <p>THis is the Preparation to the <hi>third</hi> Temptation; in which
we have, (1.) The Place where it was Acted. (2.) The
Object ſet before him there.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Place was an <hi>exceeding high Mountain.</hi> What Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it was, <hi>Nebo, Piſgah,</hi> or any other, 'tis needleſs to enquire.
'Tis of more uſe to ask after the Reaſons of Satan's choiſe of ſuch
a Place. The Text doth clearly imply one that was the <hi>commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of Proſpect;</hi> Satan intending to give him a view of the
Kingdoms of the World, chuſeth a Mountain as fitteſt for that
end. But that this was not all the Reaſon, is not only<note n="*" place="margin">Lightfoot Harm. <hi>in loc.</hi>
                        </note> intimated
by ſome, but poſitively<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Parkins Comb.</hi> in loc. Deut, 32. 49. &amp; 34. 1.</note> affirmed by others, who think that Satan
in this <hi>imitated</hi> the like in God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was called up to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49412:289"/>
Mount <hi>Neho</hi> to view the Land which God promiſed to <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
Whether theſe Circumſtances of the Mountain, and the view of
the Kingdoms of the World, were of purpoſe contrived to <hi>affront</hi>
God by ſuch an Imitation, I will not be Poſitive in it: but we
may with greater Evidence affirm, that in <hi>offering</hi> the Kingdoms
of the World, as things altogether in his diſpoſal, he doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<hi>out-brave</hi> God by an inſolent Compariſon of his Power with
that of the Almighty's, whoſe is <hi>the Earth and the fulneſs of it,</hi>
and to whom the Sovereignty of the diſpoſal of it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That which Satan ſheweth Chriſt from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
is ſaid to be the <hi>Kingdoms of the Word, and the Glory of them.</hi>
Here ſome buſy themſelves to conjecture <hi>what</hi> Kingdoms were thus
pointed at, ſome keep ſo ſtrictly to the word <hi>[all,]</hi> that they
are forced to take up with that Opinion,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hobs Leviath.</hi> c. 45. p. 354.</note> that all theſe Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were only in <hi>Viſion;</hi> for they conſider that no one Mountain
in the World, can give a <hi>Proſpect</hi> over <hi>one</hi> whole Hemiſphere, or
if it could, yet no <hi>Eye</hi> would be able to <hi>diſcern</hi> at ſo great a diſtance.
But the inconveniencies of this Surmiſe have been pointed at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and 'tis enough to ſhew that the Text may admit of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
which ſhall not be incumbred with this ſuppoſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility.</p>
                     <p>Others reſtrain this to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as if Satan only
ſhewed this as a famous <hi>Inſtance</hi> of the Glory of all Kingdoms.
Some think the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> (which was then moſt flouriſhing,
and lifted up its Head above other Kingdoms) was the great
Bait laid before Chriſt, as if he had a Deſign to divert Chriſt from
the buſineſs of his <hi>Office,</hi>

                        </note> by offering him the Seat and Power of
<hi>Antichriſt:</hi> But the Text runs not ſo favourably for any of theſe
Opinions, as to conſtrain us to ſtay upon them. <hi>[Kingdoms of the

the Word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> in <hi>Luke,</hi> which we
tranſlate <hi>the World,</hi> do ſo apply to one another in a mutual accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,
that we cannot ſtretch the World to the <hi>largeſt</hi> Senſe
of the whole <hi>Globe</hi> of the Earth, becauſe 'tis expreſſed in <hi>Luke</hi> by
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which ſignifies ſuch a part of the World which is more
<hi>cultivated</hi> and honoured by Inhabitants; nor can we ſo reſtrain it
to the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> (though when they ſpake their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of their own Empire, they ſeem to engroſs all, <hi>Luke 2. 1.)</hi>
becauſe <hi>Matthew</hi> uſeth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a word of greater <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                        <pb n="144" facs="tcp:49412:290"/>
It ſeems then that <hi>many</hi> Kingdoms, or the <hi>moſt conſiderable</hi>
Kingdoms of the then known World were here expoſed to his
Sight. But then the difficulty ſtill remains <hi>how</hi> the Devil could
ſhew them to his <hi>Eye.</hi> That it was not a <hi>viſionary</hi> diſcovery to
his Mind hath been ſaid; Some think he ſhewed theſe partly by
Ocular Proſpect of thoſe <hi>Cities, Caſtles, Towns, Vineyards,</hi> and
<hi>Fields</hi> that were neer, as a <hi>Compend</hi> of the whole; and partly by a
<hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of the Glory, Power, and Extent of other Kingdoms
that were out of the reach of the Eye: but becauſe the Expreſſion

                        <hi>[in a moment of time,]</hi> intimates that the way
which Satan took, was different from common proſpecting or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding;
others are not ſatisfied with that Solution of the difficulty,
but fly to this Suppoſition, that Satan uſed only <hi>Jugling</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,
by framing an <hi>airy Horizon</hi> before the Eyes of Chriſt;
ſhewing not the <hi>Kingdoms themſelves,</hi> but a <hi>Phantaſm</hi> of his own
making. But ſeeing this might have been done in <hi>any Place,</hi> and
that an <hi>high Mountain</hi> was choſen for furthering the <hi>Proſpect,</hi> I
think 'tis ſafeſt to conclude that the Proſpect was <hi>Ocular,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>So alſo</hi> Lucas Brugenſis <hi>thinks</hi> in loc.</note> and not
<hi>Phantaſtical</hi> but real, only helped and aſſiſted by Satan's <hi>Skill</hi> and
Art, as a great <hi>Naturaliſt,</hi> and as a Prince of the Power of the Air,
by which means, in <hi>reflections,</hi> or extraordinary <hi>Proſpectives,</hi> he
might diſcover things at <hi>vaſt diſtances:</hi> which we may the rather
fix upon, becauſe we know what helps for Proſpect, Art hath
diſcovered by <hi>Glaſſes</hi> and <hi>Teleſcopes,</hi> by which the Bodies of the
Sun, Moon, and Planets (at ſuch unſpakeable diſtance from us)
have in this <hi>latter Age</hi> been diſcovered to us, beyond ordinary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
And we have Reaſon to think that Satan's Skill this way
far exceeds any thing that we have come to the knowledg of, and
ſo might make real diſcoveries of Countrys far remote, more than
we can well imagine.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things thus explained, I ſhall note ſeveral Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> If we conſider this great Preparation that Satan makes,
as Introductory to the Temptation to follow, we may obſerve,
<hi>That where Satan hath a ſpecial Deſign, he Projects and makes ready all
things relating to the Temptation before he plainly utter his Mind:</hi> He
provides his Materials, before he builds, and lays his Train be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

and Advantage for their accompliſhment. This is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of <hi>all</hi> Sins, for in ſome that are <hi>inward</hi> in the Mind, (as
vain, Thoughts, Pride of Heart, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> there <hi>needs</hi> not ſuch Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
we may ſay of them, <hi>their times are always,</hi> and in many
caſes the <hi>Houſe is ſwept and garniſhed</hi> to his Hand, he finds all
things ready, by the forwardneſs of thoſe who are <hi>Free</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and the ſudden accidental <hi>Concurrance</hi> of things. But where
the Temptation is <hi>ſolemn,</hi> and where the thing deſigned (in the
perfecting of it) relates to <hi>Exteriour</hi> Acts, there he uſeth this
Policy, to have all in readineſs (though it coſt him the labour of
<hi>compaſſing Sea and Land</hi> for it) before he expreſly ſpeak his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.
His Reaſons are theſe;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If things neceſſary for the Encouragment and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of a Temptation, lay <hi>out of the way,</hi> and were not at
hand, his Suggeſtions would <hi>periſh</hi> as ſoon as they were <hi>born,</hi> and
would be rejected as <hi>impoſſible</hi> or inconvenient. To tempt a Man
to ſteal, when he knows not <hi>where,</hi> nor <hi>how,</hi> or to revenge when
he hath no <hi>Enemy,</hi> nor <hi>Provocation;</hi> ſeem to be no other than if
they ſhould be commanded to remove a Mountain, or to fly in the
Air; which would quickly be declined, as Motions affording no
ground of entertainment. And therefore that his Temptations
may not bring a <hi>Reaſon</hi> of <hi>refuſal</hi> with them, as being <hi>unſeaſonable;</hi>
he takes care to fit his Servants with all things requiſite for the
work he puts them upon.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As Temptations (of this kind) would be no Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
(becauſe not feaſible,) without their Preparations; ſo
muſt we not think that it is the <hi>bare Suggeſtion</hi> of Satan that makes
a Temptation to <hi>pierce.</hi> The Reaſon of its Prevalency, is not
barely becauſe Satan breaks ſuch a <hi>Motion</hi> to us, but becauſe ſuch
a Motion comes <hi>accompliſhed</hi> with all ſuitable <hi>Preparations.</hi> When
it prevails, it is the ſinful <hi>Motion</hi> that <hi>wounds,</hi> but <hi>Preparations</hi>
are as the <hi>Feathers</hi> that wing his Arrows, without which they
would neither fly nor pierce.</p>
                     <p>Let this,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> Firſt, renew our Caution and Suſpition in every thing,
and every place, that Satan is at work againſt us, though we ſee
no viſible ſnare.</p>
                     <p>Let it put us upon ſuch a watchful carefulneſs in every of our
ways, that we may reſolve to undertake nothing for which we
have not a good and warantable Reaſon at hand, that if our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49412:291"/>
ſay to us, What doſt thou here? we may be able to give a
good Account.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If we mind the behaviour of Satan in theſe Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Offers, we ſee him act after the Pattern of higheſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty,
diſpoſing of Earthly Kingdoms at ſuch a rate, as if
all Power were in his Hand Hence we may obſerve, <hi>That when
Satan tempts to Sin of higheſt Contempt and Inſolency againſt God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>he
then thinks it concerns him to bear himſelf out, by confronting the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
in imitating his Authority and Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This carriage of Satan is not to be found in all his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
For in moſt caſes he acts with greateſt <hi>ſecreſy;</hi> and as a
Thief that is afraid of Diſcovery, he uſeth all ways poſſible for
<hi>Concealment;</hi> but when he ſets up himſelf as <hi>the God of the World,</hi>
and ſtands in Competition with the Lord, claming an Intereſt in
the Fear and Devotion of Men, then he boldly <hi>avoucheth</hi> himſelf,
and labours to <hi>out-vie</hi> God in point of greatneſs, that he might
poſſeſs them with a belief that he only ought to be feared.
This Arrogancy of Satan againſt God, may be ſeen in <hi>three</hi>
things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In <hi>imitating Divine Ordinances,</hi> and Inſtitutions. There
is not any part of Divine Worſhip the Obſervation whereof God
hath enjoyned to Men, but Satan hath ſet up ſomething like it for
himſelf. As God appointed his <hi>Temple, Prieſts, Altars, Sacrifices,
Offerings, Tyths, Sanctuaries, Sacrament,</hi> &amp;c. So hath Satan had
his <hi>Temples, Prieſts, Altars, Sacrifices, Offerings, Sanctuaries, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi>
&amp;c. This is ſufficiently known to any that read his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and I could give a full Account of it from Heathen Authors,
but that I have done already when I ſpoke of Satan Subtilty in
promoting Idolatry in the World. I ſhall only add here that which
<hi>Varro</hi> relates of the Books of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Varro de cultu Deorum.</note> which were caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
caſt up by the Plough of one <hi>Terentius,</hi> coming too near the
Sepulchre of <hi>Numa,</hi> where theſe Books had been Buried. This
<hi>Numa</hi> was the ſecond King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who inſtituted the
<hi>Rites</hi> and Ceremonies of <hi>Pagan Worſhip</hi> for his Subjects, and in
theſe Books (which he thought fit to conceal, by burying them
with him) he had laid open the Bottom of theſe Deviliſh <hi>Myſteries,</hi>
ſo that when they were brought to the <hi>Senate,</hi> they (judging
them unfit to be known) adjudged them to the <hi>Fire.</hi> Which is
a clear ground of Suſpition that he had there diſcovered ſo much
of the Cauſes of theſe Rites, or of the way whereby he came to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49412:291"/>
be inſtructed in them, that the publick Knowledg thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
not with the Intereſt of their Heatheniſh Religion.<note place="margin">De Civit Dei. <hi>l. 7. c.</hi> 34, &amp; 35.</note> This
conjecture <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath of the Matter, who alſo notes that <hi>Numa</hi>
pretended familiar Converſe with the <hi>Nymph Aegeria,</hi> as a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
cover to that deviliſh Art of <hi>Hydromantia,</hi> by which he was
inſtructed in ordering the Ceremonies of Idolatry, which he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Satan with no leſs Arrogancy, takes upon him to
Imitate God, in his <hi>Acts of Power</hi> for the <hi>countenancing</hi> of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
in the World. He had his Miracles frequently, of which I
have ſpoken elſewhere, ſo had he his Oracles, as at <hi>Delphos,</hi> and
other places. Here it ſhall ſuffice to note, that as the ſending the
Lord Jeſus into the World, furniſhed with ſuch Power of doing
Miracles for the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of that Office and Authority, which
he had received from God, for the Redemption of Man; was the
<hi>higheſt Inſtance</hi> that can be given of the Mighty Power, Wiſdom,
and Goodneſs of God; ſo Satan ſet himſelf with greateſt Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
to Imitate that. Chriſt was almoſt no ſooner aſcended to the
Father, but we hear of <hi>Simon Magus; Acts.</hi> 8. 9. who was cryed
up as an Inſtance of the <hi>great Power of God;</hi> and after that at <hi>Rome</hi>
he gave out that he was <hi>God,</hi> confirming the People in ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
by the ſtrange things which he there did among them, that
a <hi>Statue</hi> was erected for his Honour, with this Inſcription, <hi>To</hi>
Simon <hi>a Great God.</hi> Long after this, the Devil raiſed up <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
Tyanaeus,</hi> a Man of an Abſtemious and Commendable Life;
him the Devil did deſign to match Chriſt in his Miracles, which
were ſo many and ſo ſtrange, that <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> doth not only <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi>
him to Chriſt, but <hi>prefer</hi> him as the more Honourable Perſon.
Chriſt himſelf foretold this Stratagem of Satan, that he ſhould
raiſe up <hi>falſe Chriſts</hi> with <hi>lying Signs and Wonders.</hi> And to omit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of former days, it is not beyond the Memory of moſt of you,
That the Devil renewed this Policy in <hi>James Nayler,</hi> who in a
blaſphemous <hi>Imitation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's riding to</hi> Jeruſalem, rode to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol</hi>
with a great Company before him, Crying, <hi>Holy, Holy,</hi> and
<hi>Hoſanna to the Son of</hi> David, and ſtrewing the way with Branches
of Trees: The Authority that was then, taking notice of this
and other Blaſphemous outrages, ſentenced him to exemplary
Puniſhment: but here alſo the Devil renewed his <hi>Mockery,</hi> for a
certain Citizen of <hi>London</hi> of good note, being overcome with
Deluſion, Printed a Book of <hi>Naylers</hi> Sufferings, wherein the Devil
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49412:292"/>
had opportunity to vent his Malice more fully, for he compared
all the parts of his Puniſhment, to the Sufferings of Chriſt; his
<hi>Whipping</hi> he ſaid was, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken
by <hi>Matthew, And</hi> Pilate <hi>delivered him to be Scourged;</hi> His <hi>Stigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi>
he ſaid, was that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by
the Prophet, <hi>his Viſage was marred more than any Mans;</hi> the <hi>Boring</hi> of
his Tongue with an hot Iron, he ſaid was the fulfilling of that,
and they <hi>Crucified him:</hi> and after other particulars of Compariſon,
(in all which he equalled him to Chriſt) he at laſt takes notice
that the multitude of Spectators held off their Hats, while his
Tongue was bored thorow, (a thing common in a Croud to give
opportunity of Sight to thoſe that are behind) and to this act he
applys that of the <hi>Evangeliſts, The Vail of the Temple was rent from
the top to the bottom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In acts of <hi>Empire</hi> and Sovereignty he Imitates God:
that is, as God propounds himſelf as the only Lord God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
himſelf to be worſhipped accordingly, by <hi>Promiſes</hi> of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in caſe of Obedience, and <hi>threatnings</hi> of Miſeries and
Plagues in caſe of Diſobedience; ſo doth Satan ſet up himſelf in
the World as God to be adored and worſhipped, and him do all
Idolaters worſhip, as God teſtifies, <hi>Deut. 32. 17. They ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
unto Devils, not to God.</hi> Pſal. 106. 37. <hi>They ſacrificed their Sons
and Daughters unto Devils.</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 20. <hi>The things which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to Devils, and not to God.</hi> And though it
be true, that many of theſe blind Worſhippers did not <hi>formally</hi>
worſhip the Devil, but thought they had worſhipped God, yet by
ſuch cunning did he engage them to take up with ways of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of his preſcribing, that it was in <hi>reality</hi> a Service done to him.
But beſides this, in thoſe places of the World, where he hath
greater Power, he <hi>formally</hi> propounds himſelf to be worſhipped,
and doth accordingly often appear to them in a <hi>Viſible Shape;</hi> ſo
that many of theſe blind Heathens acknowledg <hi>two God's,</hi> one
<hi>Good,</hi> and another <hi>Cruel</hi> and hurtful, which latter they ſay they
muſt worſhip, leſt he <hi>deſtroy,</hi> or harm them. By this Satan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
with God for an Empire in the World, and to promote it
the more, he ſometimes deals by <hi>fair Promiſes,</hi> of Riches, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
Pleaſure, and ſuch other Baits, to allure Men to his
Profeſſed Service; thus are <hi>Witches</hi> drawn to a Compact with him.
Thus <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the ſecond gave up himſelf to the Devil for the
<hi>Popedom,</hi> and ſo did ſeveral others. When this is not enough to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49412:292"/>
prevail, he adds <hi>Menacings,</hi> and breaths forth cruel Threatnings, by
which means many Heathens are kept in awe by him, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him, <hi>ne noceat,</hi> for no other reaſon but to preſerve themſelves
from hurt by him. In this Temptation he propounds himſelf to
Chriſt as the Object of Divine Worſhip, and boaſts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the World as things of his diſpoſal; by which he ſeeks to
draw him to fall down before him.</p>
                     <p>This courſe Satan takes for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, As this Proud and Malicious <hi>Oſtentation</hi> of his Power, is
ſome kind of <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to his <hi>revengeful</hi> Humour againſt
God: So Secondly, He doth hereby raiſe up himſelf and his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
inſtitutions of Idolatry, into <hi>Credit</hi> and Eſteem with Men.
Thirdly, As this is a <hi>Mockery</hi> to true <hi>Religion,</hi> and a ſcorn caſt
upon the ways of God's Service, to bring it into diſgrace and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit:
So, Fourthly, By this means he <hi>hardens</hi> the Hearts of Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God. This was the Conſideration by which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hardened
his Heart, when <hi>Moſes</hi> turned his Rod into a Serpent, changed
Waters to Blood, and did ſo many Signs before him; his <hi>Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
did the <hi>like:</hi> upon which the King might thus reaſon with
himſelf, that <hi>Moſes</hi> had no other Power, but what his <hi>Magicians</hi>
had, though he might think him a more <hi>skillful Magician,</hi> and
therefore there was no reaſon to believe his Meſſage as being from
God, ſeeing his Miracles might be no other than the Effect of his
Art, to countenance a pretended command from Heaven.</p>
                     <p>This Inſolency of Satan, may inform us; Firſt, of the great
<hi>Patience</hi> of God that ſees theſe outragious mockings, and yet doth
not by a ſtrong hand put a ſtop to them.<note place="margin">Applic.</note> Secondly, Of the great
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> of Satan, that he both <hi>can</hi> (though not without
permiſſion from God) and <hi>dare</hi> attempt things of this Nature.
Thirdly, The great <hi>Power</hi> of Deluſion, that can ſo blind Men,
that they not only are drawn to <hi>act</hi> a part in ſuch Deſigns, but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
confidently a <hi>Divine Impulſe</hi> and Heavenly warrant for their
ſo doing. Fourthly, The miſerable <hi>Slavery</hi> of ſuch Vaſſals of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
that are thus led by him, who are therefore ſadly to be pittied
and lamented, as being under ſuch ſtrong Chains of Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Obſ. 3.</note> We cannot paſs by the <hi>Art</hi> which the Devil here uſeth
to ſet off the Temptation, and to make it plauſible; he ſets before
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49412:293"/>
him the <hi>World</hi> in all its <hi>Glory.</hi> Here Obſerve, <hi>That Satan in his
Temptations to Worldly Pleaſures, doth uſually paint the Object with all
its utmoſt Beauty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When I have ſometime obſerved a <hi>Mountebank</hi> upon a Stage,
giving exceſſive Commendations of a <hi>trivial</hi> Medicine, aſſerting
it good almoſt for <hi>every</hi> Diſeaſe, and with a great many Lyes and
Boaſtings, <hi>enforcing</hi> it upon the credulous Multitude: It hath put
me in mind of this Spiritual <hi>Mountebankery</hi> of the Devil; how doth
he <hi>gull</hi> and delude the Fooliſh, by laying out the Pleaſures of
Sin? and no otherwiſe doth he keep them at a <hi>gazing Admiration</hi>
of Worldly Pomp, Delights and Satisfaction, which he promiſeth
them from Iniquity, than the Serpent <hi>Scytale</hi> doth with Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
whom ſhe ſtays, by amazing them with her beautiful Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
till ſhe have ſtung them. The Art of Satan in this matter
lyes in four things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If there be any thing that can be called a <hi>Delight,</hi> or may
any way conduce to a Satisfaction in any <hi>Sin,</hi> he will be ſure to
ſpeak of it in its <hi>higheſt Praiſes;</hi> he not only ſtreacheth his <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
to the height in giving Commendations to the moſt noted
Pleaſures that Men propound to themſelves: but he ſeeks out the
<hi>hidden</hi> things of Delight, and raiſeth in Men an <hi>Itch</hi> of deſire after
the improvement of Delight, by the <hi>contrivances</hi> of Wit or Art.
Thus he tells them of Jollity, raviſhing Mirth, high Satisfaction,
and (if they will believe him) of unſpeakable Delight to be had
by giving themſelves up to the World, and the Courſe of it. Nay
he hides nothing that will bear any Praiſe, the <hi>leaſt</hi> Advantage, the
<hi>ſmalleſt</hi> Gratification that any Sin can afford to Humane Deſire, he
will be ſure to ſpeak of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He carries on this Deſign by <hi>Lying,</hi> he promiſeth
more than ever Sin can give, and he ſends his <hi>Proſelytes</hi> out after
Sin under the <hi>higheſt Expectations,</hi> and when they come to enjoy
it, they often find the Pleaſure <hi>falls ſhort</hi> of his Boaſt; he <hi>whiſpers
Honours,</hi> Preferments, and Riches, in the Ear of their Hearts,
and often pays them with <hi>Poverty</hi> and Diſgraces, and gives them
<hi>pro theſauro carbones, Stones</hi> for <hi>Bread,</hi> a <hi>Serpent</hi> for a <hi>Fiſh.</hi> Witches
give frequent Accounts of Satan's lying Promiſes, he tells them
of Feaſts, of Gold, of Riches, but they find themſelves deluded;
he ſends them oft hungry away from thoſe Banquets, ſo that they
have no more than when a Man <hi>Dreams</hi> he Eats. He gives that
which ſeems Gold in Appearance, but at laſt they find it to be
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49412:293"/>
Slaits or Shells. We find in this Temptation he is liberal and
large in his Offers to Chriſt, and what he requires he will have in
<hi>preſent Payment,</hi> but the reward for the Service is <hi>future:</hi> 'Tis his
buſineſs to engage Men in Sin, by his <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Advantage, but
being once engaged, he takes not himſelf concerned in Honour
or Ingenuity for <hi>Performance.</hi> Hence doth the Scripture fitly call
the Pleaſures of Sin, <hi>lying Vanities,</hi> a <hi>vain Shew,</hi> a <hi>Dream,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
warning Men from a forward Belief of Satan's Promiſes, in
that they find by Experience they ſhall be at laſt but Lyes and
Diſappointments.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To make his Bait more taking, he conceals all the
<hi>inconveniencies</hi> that may attend theſe Worldly Delights. He Offers
here the Kingdoms of the World to Chriſt, as if all were made
up of Pleaſure; theſe Cares, Troubles, and Vexations, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Greatneſs and Rule he mentions not; their Burthen, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
and Diſquiet he paſſeth over. Thus in common Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he is careful to hide from Men the Miſeries that follow theſe
empty Pleaſures; So that often Men do not conſider the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
till <hi>a Dart ſtrike through their Liver,</hi> Prov. 7. 23. and till a
<hi>dear-bought Experience</hi> doth inform them of their Miſtakes.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, His Power and work upon the Fancies of Men, is
none of the leaſt of his ways, whereby he advanceth the Pleaſures
of Sin. That he hath ſuch a Power hath been diſcourſed before,
and that a Fancy <hi>raiſed</hi> to a great Expectation, makes things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<hi>otherwiſe</hi> than what they are, is evident from <hi>common Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
the <hi>value</hi> of moſt things depends rather upon <hi>Fancy</hi> than the
Internal worth of them, and Men are more engaged to a purſuit of
things by the <hi>Eſtimation</hi> which <hi>Fancy</hi> hath begat in their Minds,
than by <hi>certain</hi> Principles of Knowledg. Children by Fancy have a
value of their Toys, and are ſo powerfully ſwayed by it, that things
of far greater price cannot ſtay their Deſigns, nor divert their Courſe.
Satan knows that the beſt of Men are ſometimes childiſh, apt to be
led about by their conceits, and apt in their conceits to apprehend
things far otherwiſe than what they are in Truth.<note place="margin">D'Eſpaigne <hi>popular Errors.</hi> §. 1. cap. 4.</note> Hence is it (as one
obſerves) that of <hi>thouſands</hi> of Men that return from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or
from Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> or from the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> ſcarce can we find
<hi>one,</hi> which brings back the Admiration which he had conceived
before he had ſeen them. Fancy doth <hi>preoccupate</hi> the Mind with
an high opinion of things, and theſe exorbitant Imaginations
paſs to ſuch an exceſs, that Men think to find a ſatisfaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49412:294"/>
the Nature of theſe Pleaſures they aim at, which hath theſe
<hi>two</hi> inconveniencies, the <hi>one,</hi> that this <hi>Effects</hi> and draws as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
as if they were all as <hi>real</hi> and high as they are conceited to
be; the <hi>other,</hi> that Sight and Fruition <hi>takes away</hi> the Eſtimation,
and by a diſappointment, doth deaden and dull the Affections to
what may be really found there. Thus Satan by one deceit makes
Men believe that Sin hath Pleaſure, which indeed it hath not, and
by that belief <hi>leads</hi> them on powerfully to endeavour an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement
of them, and at laſt urgeth them with a <hi>deluſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In oppoſition to this deceit of the Devil,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> we muſt learn to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
Worldly Delights as <hi>low</hi> as he would value them <hi>high.</hi>
And to this purpoſe the Scripture ſpeaks of them, in underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing
Language,<note place="margin">

a <hi>Faſhion,</hi> or <hi>Figure,</hi> an <hi>Imagination</hi> rather then a reallity; and
further injoyns us not to <hi>admire</hi> theſe things in others, not to <hi>envy</hi>
them that enjoyment of them,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 1. &amp; 49. 16.</note> nor to <hi>fret</hi> at our want of them,
much leſs to be <hi>tranſported</hi> with any angry Paſſion about them, nor
to concern our ſelves in any <hi>earneſt</hi> purſuit of them.<note place="margin">Jer. 45. 5.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Obſ. 4.</note> Satan in this Temptation did not bravely ſpeak of
theſe things, nor only make an offer in Diſcourſe, but he thought
it moſt conduceable to his Deſign, to preſent them <hi>to his Sight;</hi> he
knew full well, that the Heart is more affected by <hi>ſenſible Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,</hi>
than by <hi>rational Diſcourſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note here,</hi> That Satan in Temptations of Worldly Pleaſure, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to engage the Affections by the Sences.</p>
                     <p>That 'tis Satan's great buſineſs to work upon the Affections,
I have ſhewed at large. Here he endeavoured to prepare the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
of Chriſt, that ſo the motion (when it came) might not
<hi>die,</hi> as a Spark falling upon wet Tinder, but that the Affections
being ſtirred up, might <hi>cheriſh</hi> the Offer, and that the Offer by a
<hi>mutual warmth,</hi> might more <hi>enflame</hi> the Affections that were heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before.</p>
                     <p>To this End he works by the Senſes, and would have Chriſt's
<hi>Eye</hi> to raiſe his <hi>Affections</hi> of Love, Deſire, Hope, and whatever
elſe might wing his Soul to Activity. There is a great <hi>connection</hi>
betwixt the Senſes and the Affection, the Senſes bring <hi>Intelligence</hi>
unavoidably, and are apt to ſtir up our Powers to Action: as the
<hi>Jaccall</hi> is ſaid to hunt the Prey for the <hi>Lyon,</hi> ſo do the Senſes for
the Affections, and both for Satan.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:49412:294"/>
It is alſo remarkable that Satan endeavouring to make the Eyes
of Chriſt Traytors to his Affections, and that he thinking it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to give him a view of what he proffered him, ſhould not
give him <hi>time</hi> to take a <hi>full Survey</hi> of theſe Kingdoms, but ſhould
<hi>huddle</hi> it up in ſuch an <hi>haſt,</hi> that all (as <hi>Luke</hi> tell us) was done
in a <hi>moment of time:</hi> was Satan in haſte? or was he unwilling to
part with what he ſo liberally proffered? Surely no, but this
<hi>tranſient view</hi> was his <hi>Subtilty,</hi> to entice him the more, and to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame</hi>
his Heart with greater deſires.<note place="margin">Obſ. 5.</note> Obſerve then, <hi>That where
Satan is moſt liberal in his Proffers, he there manageth his Overtures of
Advantage with a ſeeming ſhyneſs.</hi> And this he doth, Firſt, To <hi>heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
the worth of them in our Eſtimation, as if they were <hi>Jewels</hi>

purſuit. Our natural <hi>Curioſity</hi> preſſeth us with great earneſtneſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Now though this be a Sin which the Heart of a Servant of
God would moſt abhor, yet Satan doth ſometimes trouble the beſt
with it. We have an Inſtance in <hi>Job,</hi> his Deſign was to bring

by <hi>Jobs</hi> Anſwer that it was evil Counſel, but alſo by Satan's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed
Deſign that it was directly for Curſing God. Beſides this
Inſtance, if we conſider the Expreſſion of <hi>fiery Darts, Eph.</hi> 6. we
ſhall find that this Temptation is more common to all ſorts
of Chriſtians than we would imagine; 'tis plain that theſe words
allude to the <hi>poyſoned Arrows,</hi> which <hi>Scythians</hi> and others uſed;
theſe not only wounded but poyſoned, and the Venom infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

Firſt, He endeavours to bring Men to Blaſpheme, by <hi>ſecret</hi> and
ſubtile ways of <hi>enſnaring</hi> them, and this is moſt what practiſed in
<hi>Conſequential</hi> and Covert Blaſphemies. When though Men do
not directly intend an <hi>open out-rage</hi> againſt God, yet Satan brings
them to that which might be ſo <hi>Interpreted.</hi> This ſeems to have

                        <note place="margin">Job 1. 22.</note> yet he preſſed him ſo hard
by his Miſeries, that he hoped at laſt to bring him to utter the

tendency that way, that when his Friend <hi>Eliphaz</hi> took
notice of his Expreſſions, as ſavouring of too much Diſtruſt, he is
forced to make <hi>Apology</hi> for himſelf, and to excuſe it by the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs
of his Condition; Job 6. 26. <hi>Do you imagine to reprove
Words, and the Speeches of one that is deſperate.</hi> In ſuch caſes the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
provokes Men beyond their intentions to ſpeak in their haſte ſo
inconſiderately, that they know not, or mind not the juſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of their Speeches. It was a <hi>degree</hi> of Blaſphemy in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
to ſay (though in his haſte) <hi>that all Men were Lyers;</hi> it was an
unbelieving Reflection on the Promiſe given him by <hi>Samuel.</hi> In
<hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 13. the People did not believe that they had <hi>ſpoken ſo
much againſt God,</hi> when yet their <hi>Words</hi> had been <hi>ſtout againſt
him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Satan endeavours this by violent <hi>Injections</hi> of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
thoughts that are <hi>directly</hi> ſuch. In this I ſhall note to
you,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the <hi>vileſt</hi> Thoughts of God, of his Ways and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences,
of Scripture, and of Chriſt, are frequently ſuggeſted;
things of <hi>greateſt out-rage</hi> againſt Heaven, and Contempt of the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49412:296"/>
Almighty, as <hi>Bernard</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>terribilia de Fide, horribilia de
Divinitate;</hi> as that there is <hi>no God,</hi> or that he is <hi>not Juſt,</hi> or <hi>not
Faithful</hi> to his Promiſes; or that Chriſt was but an <hi>Impoſtor:</hi> he
ſticks at nothing in this kind, though never ſo contrary to the
Hope and Perſwaſion of thoſe whom he thus moleſts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Theſe are frequently <hi>reiterated</hi> upon them, and their
minds ſo troubled by them, that they cannot free themſelves
from ſuch thoughts, but he <hi>follows</hi> on, and <hi>clamours</hi> in their Ears
(as <hi>Gerſon</hi> obſerves) <hi>Nega Deum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tem. 4.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, And this with ſo great a <hi>force</hi> and <hi>Impetuoſity,</hi> that
they are compelled to <hi>form</hi> theſe thoughts in their <hi>Minds,</hi> and to
ſpeak <hi>contrary</hi> to what they would; as if their Thoughts and
Tongues were not under their <hi>own Government,</hi> the Devil not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
himſelf to bear in theſe Thoughts upon them, but he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
as it were, to make them <hi>ſay after him,</hi> and to caſt his Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
into their <hi>own Mould,</hi> that ſo they might ſeem properly to
be their own: and this they are forced to whether they will or no,
even then when their <hi>Minds</hi> are filled with <hi>Horrour,</hi> their <hi>Heart</hi>
with <hi>Grief,</hi> and their <hi>Body</hi> with <hi>Trembling.</hi> I have diſcourſed
with ſome who have bitterly complained that their Tongues and
their Thoughts ſeemed not to be their own, but that Satan <hi>ruled</hi>
them at his <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> and that when in oppoſition to the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they would have formed their Tongues to ſpeak, <hi>Bleſſing of
God,</hi> they have ſpoken <hi>Curſing</hi> inſtead of <hi>Bleſſing;</hi> and that when
a blaſphemous Thought had been <hi>caſt</hi> into their Mind, they could
not be at reſt till they had <hi>thought it again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Scala Paradiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. gradu. 23.</note> Theſe troubleſome Temptations are oft of <hi>long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.
Joannes Climacus</hi> tells us of a <hi>Monk</hi> that was troubled
with blaſphemous Thoughts for <hi>twenty years</hi> together, and could
not quit himſelf of them, though he had macerated his Body with
Watchings and Faſtings. Some have them <hi>going</hi> away, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning</hi>
again by <hi>fits,</hi> according as the prevalency and ferment of
their <hi>Melancholy</hi> gives Satan the advantage of dealing thus with
them. For if we enquire why it is thus, eſpecially with the
Children of God, we muſt <hi>partly</hi> reſolve it into the <hi>unſearchable
Wiſdom of God,</hi> who for Holy Ends of <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Diſciplining</hi>
his Servants, permits Satan thus to moleſt them; and <hi>partly</hi> into
thoſe <hi>particular advantages</hi> which Satan hath againſt them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the variety of their <hi>Conditions,</hi> which uſually are theſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:49412:297"/>
Firſt, He takes advantage of ſuch <hi>Bodily Diſtempers</hi> as do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
Men of the uſe of their <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as <hi>Feavers, Frenzies, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
in theſe he oft forms the Tongues of Men to horrid blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Speeches.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a Preſſure of outward <hi>Afflictions</hi> gives him his deſired
opportunity, and this he knows to be generally ſo ſucceſsful, that
he promiſed himſelf by this means a Victory over <hi>Job.</hi> Ordinarily
<hi>Straits</hi> and Miſeries do produce <hi>Blaſpheming.</hi> Eſa. 8. 21. the
Prophet notes, that when the People ſhould be <hi>hardly beſtead and
hungry,</hi> they ſhould <hi>fret themſelves, and curſe their King and their
God, and look upward,</hi> as avouching what they had done.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Worldly <hi>Plenty,</hi> Fulneſs, and Pleaſure lay often Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of this Temptation: when their Cups are <hi>full,</hi> and their
Hearts <hi>high,</hi> Satan can eaſily make them ſet their <hi>Mouth againſt
Heaven.</hi> A Proud Heart will readily ſay, <hi>our Tongue is our own,</hi> or
<hi>who is the Lord?</hi> This was the Engine which the Devil managed
(if it were as <hi>Job</hi> ſuſpected) againſt the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Job</hi>
to make them Curſe God in their Hearts; and by this did he ſeek
to prevail upon Chriſt in this blaſphemous Temptation.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A <hi>Melancholy</hi> Diſtemper doth uſually invite Satan to
give blaſphemous Suggeſtions; the <hi>diſturbed</hi> and <hi>plyable</hi> Fancies of
ſuch are the advantages which he improves againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Inward <hi>Terrors</hi> and Diſtreſſe of <hi>Conſcience</hi> are alſo an
occaſion to Satan to move them (as by a deſperate Humor) to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hard things of God, and againſt themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But there is yet a third way by which Satan tempts Men to
Blaſpheming, by <hi>ſudden Glances</hi> of <hi>blaſphemous Imaginations,</hi> which
like Lightnings do aſtoniſh the Heart and then ſuddenly Vaniſh,
theſe are very common, and the beſt of Men obſerve them fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently.
Satan ſeems as it were rather to <hi>Frolick</hi> and <hi>Sport</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in theſe Suggeſtions, than to intend a <hi>ſerious</hi> Temptation;
their danger is not ſo much, yet are they not to be <hi>deſpiſed,</hi> leſt
theſe often viſits (careleſly entertained, and not diſmiſſed with
<hi>juſt abhorrency)</hi> do ſecretly <hi>envenom</hi> the Soul, and prepare it for
ſtronger Aſſaults.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall next enquire into the Reaſons of this trouble which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
gives the Children of God.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Theſe Temptations are very <hi>affrighting</hi> though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
not, yet they are full of perplexing annoyance. <hi>Corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
ſtartles at them, and receives them not without dread and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49412:297"/>
'tis ſadly troubleſome to hear <hi>others</hi> Blaſpheme God. <hi>The
reproaches of thoſe that reproached thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) fell upon me:</hi> It
was as a <hi>Sword in his Bones,</hi> to hear the blaſphemous Scoffs of the
wicked, when they ſaid to him, <hi>where is thy God?</hi> And if it were
confuſion and ſhame to him to hear the <hi>Enemy Reproach</hi> and <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme,</hi>
(as he profeſſeth it was, <hi>Pſal. 44. 15, 16.)</hi> how ſadly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
would it be for any Child of God to obſerve ſuch things
in his <hi>own</hi> Imaginations? If there were no more in its than this, it
is enough to put Satan upon that Deſign, becauſe 'tis a troubleſome
kind of<note n="*" place="margin">Spiritus Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ph miae, ſcatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigo eſt cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionum adeo horribilium a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deoque mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarum, ut ejus Tentatio ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque quaſi Martyrium eſt. <hi>Guil.

                        <hi>Martyrdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, This is alſo a <hi>ſpiteful revenge</hi> againſt God, all he can
do is to blaſpheme and rage; and 'tis a kind of Delight, to put
this force upon thoſe that carry his own <hi>Image:</hi> he would do all
he can to make his own <hi>Children</hi> to <hi>vilify</hi> and reproach their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>Father,</hi> and to render Curſing for Bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This Temptation, though it have not the <hi>Conſent</hi> or
Complyance of God's Children, yet it <hi>opens</hi> a way to many <hi>other
Sins,</hi> as Murmuring, Diſtruſt, Deſpair, wearineſs of God's Ways
and Services. When we find Satan thus to run upon us, it is
apt to breed <hi>ſtrange thoughts of God,</hi> that thus <hi>permits</hi> Satan to take
us by the Throat, or to make us <hi>judge of our ſelves</hi> as rejected of
God, and given up to Satan's Power; and if it do this, his labour
is not in vain: we are (as<note n="†" place="margin">Magis a dolo metuendum eſt quam a violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia adverſarii, caveat aeger ab impatientia, infidelitate, murmuratione aliiſque pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis quae clam inſinuantur. <hi>Dikson Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peut. ſacra.</hi> lib 2. c. 29.</note> one obſerve) more to fear his Subtilty
in bringing us by this into <hi>other ſnares,</hi> than the violence of the
Adverſary in <hi>this Suggeſtion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, This is a Stratagem, for laying the <hi>Foundation</hi> of
direful <hi>Accuſations,</hi> the Devil in this, doth as the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> are<note n="‖" place="margin">Heylin Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogr.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to do: they when they have a ſpite againſt any of their
Neighbours, hide ſecretly ſome of their Goods in their Houſes,
and then accuſe them of Theft. When blaſphemous Thoughts
are injected, and Men refuſe to conſent, then Satan raiſeth an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
againſt them (as <hi>Joſephs</hi> Miſtreſs did) as if they were
<hi>guilty</hi> of all that Blaſphemy that he tempted them unto; and 'tis
a difficult task to perſwade them, that theſe things ſhould be <hi>in
their Minds,</hi> and that they ſhould not be the <hi>proper Iſſues</hi> of their
own Heart. And very often doth he from hence accuſe them of
ſinning againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe of the hideous Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
which he had firſt ſuggeſted to them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Appli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> This will give us conſiderations of Conſolation, and that
(1.) In regard of <hi>others:</hi> We obſerve often our <hi>ſick</hi> Friends ſpeak,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49412:298"/>
what we would not willingly hear, and it cannot chuſe but be
ſadly afflictive, to hear their Curſes and blaſphemous Speeches:
but when we conſider the advantage that Satan takes of their
<hi>Diſtemper,</hi> (if their lives heretofore have been <hi>Pious</hi> and Religous)
we comfort our ſelves in this, that it is more <hi>his Malice,</hi> than their
<hi>own Inclinations;</hi> neither ſhould we ſuffer our Hope or Charity to be
diſtreſſed on their behalf. (2.) It is the like ground of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
for <hi>our ſelves</hi> or others that are violently afflicted with blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Thoughts. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If we call to mind that our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> ſuffered <hi>ſuch</hi>
things, we that are of his <hi>Houſhold</hi> need not think we receive a
ſtrange or <hi>unuſual</hi> Meaſure, in that we are moleſted as he was.
Secondly, If we conſider that Chriſt was tempted <hi>without Sin</hi> on
his part, then may we fetch this concluſion from it, <hi>That it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that ſuch thoughts ſhould be caſt upon us, and yet that we may not
be chargeable with them as our Iniquities.</hi> Thirdly, We may hence
ſee, that ſuch Temptations are more <hi>frightful</hi> than <hi>hurtful;</hi> theſe
(as one obſerves) ſeldom <hi>take,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

<hi>horror</hi> (to thoſe that believe and love the true God) that it
keeps them from a <hi>participation</hi> with Satan in the Sin it ſelf, nay
it fills them with <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>ſtriving</hi> againſt it; they rather, as <hi>Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears,
ſcare</hi> and diſquiet them, than produce the <hi>real Effects</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The conſideration of this kind of Temptation may
fill the Hearts and Mouths of thoſe of us, as have not hitherto
been troubled with it, with <hi>Praiſe</hi> for ſo Merciful a Preſervation.
If we have not been under this kind of Exerciſe, it is not from
any <hi>good Will</hi> that Satan hath to us, but becauſe our God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from him. A poor weak Chriſtian wonders
that Satan hath not made him a <hi>Mark</hi> for this <hi>Arrow,</hi> that he hath
not <hi>broken</hi> him with this <hi>Tempeſt.</hi> To anſwer that Wonder, he may
know that the ſame tenderneſs in God, that will not put <hi>new
Wine into old crazy Bottles,</hi> nor a <hi>new ſtiff piece of Cloth in to an old ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Father, doth keep off ſuch Tryals, becauſe he will not ſuffer
them <hi>to be tempted above what they are able.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, This Temptation calls for <hi>advice</hi> to thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, to whom I ſhall direct a few things:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:49412:298"/>
Firſt, When any are troubled with blaſphemous thoughts, let it
be conſidered <hi>in what ſtate and temper their Body is:</hi> if it be diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
with <hi>Melancholy</hi> (as is moſt uſual) then the Preſcription of
an able <hi>Phyſitian</hi> is neceſſary in the <hi>firſt place,</hi> without which he
that would ſpiritually adviſe or counſel, ſhall but <hi>beat the Air,</hi> and
his words be ſo far from the faſtneſs of Nails, that they ſhall be
as Wind. I have known many under great complaints and fears
by reaſon hereof, that have been cured by <hi>Phyſick alone:</hi> for when
(in this Caſe) the <hi>Fewel</hi> is withdrawn, the <hi>Fire</hi> goes out; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the Melancholy Temper that gives the Devil this advantage,
and the Trouble will ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is of great Conſequence to underſtand the <hi>Nature
of theſe Temptations:</hi> if the tempted could ſee theſe to be their
<hi>Sufferings,</hi> rather than their <hi>Sins,</hi> they would with greater eaſe
bear it as an <hi>Affliction.</hi> And to thoſe that <hi>complain, abhor, reſiſt</hi> and
<hi>pray</hi> againſt them they are not <hi>Sins,</hi> no more than when an <hi>Harlot</hi>
layeth her Child at an <hi>Honeſt</hi> Womans Door, that Child is to be
reckoned as the Fruit of her Wickedneſs. A Gyant may daſh the
Son againſt his Father, but ſo far will the Father be from impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it as <hi>rebellious Inſolence</hi> in his Child, that he will pitty him the
<hi>more,</hi> as ſuffering by a <hi>double</hi> Injury; for 'tis not only againſt his
<hi>natural Affection</hi> and Reverence to his Parent, but 'tis a <hi>bodily
hurt</hi> beſide: thus will God much more pitty his Children under
theſe Sufferings.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, We muſt not ſuffer ſuch thoughts to <hi>lodge</hi> in us, but
before they ſettle (if poſſible) we muſt <hi>repel</hi> them: as <hi>Abraham</hi>
drove away the Fowls that came down upon his Sacrifice. I
know the Tempted will ſay, this advice is not <hi>Practicable,</hi> they
find theſe thoughts ſwarm about them as <hi>Bees,</hi> and when one is
driven <hi>back,</hi> another ſtraight <hi>comes</hi> in its place. But to them I
Anſwer, that blaſphemous thoughts are repelled <hi>two</hi> ways: (1.)
By <hi>ſtout and reſolute reſiſtance.</hi> This though it do not <hi>extinguiſh</hi> them,
nor free us of the trouble, yet it keeps them from <hi>ſetling</hi> upon us,
and us from the <hi>Guilt</hi> of them. (2.) By <hi>Diverſion,</hi> which the
work of a lawful <hi>Imployment,</hi> or <hi>good Society,</hi> and other <hi>Diſcourſes</hi>
may do;<note place="margin">Faeda Tentatio magis vincitur fugiendo quam aggrediendo. <hi>Gerſon t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourthly, In Temptations to Blaſphemy, <hi>confident Refuſals</hi> do
better then <hi>Diſputings;</hi> here we are to reſiſt with Courage, and a
<hi>Holy Contempt</hi> of Satan: if we be too timerous and fearful, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49412:299"/>
ſuits the more upon us: as Dogs when they are obſerved, follow
the Paſſenger with greater eagerneſs and noiſe. <hi>Abhorrencies</hi> and
<hi>poſitive Diſcharges</hi> (like that of Chriſt in the ſame Caſe, <hi>Get
thee hence Satan)</hi> do <hi>more</hi> for us, than to <hi>debate</hi> the matter with
him.</p>

Idolatry to uſe religious Worſhip to <hi>that</hi> which is not God, or <hi>before</hi>
it, but theſe things I ſhall not proſecute, keeping therefore to my
deſign I ſhall obſerve.</p>
                     <p>That it is one of Satan's great deſigns to corrupt the Worſhip of God.<note place="margin">Obſ. 7.</note>
That this is ſo, will appear,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If we conſider what <hi>varieties</hi> of Worſhip hath been in the
World. God gave a <hi>fixed</hi> and ſtable Law, and yet this ſo little
prevailed, that Men were upon new Inventions <hi>preſently.</hi> I ſhall
not need to reckon up the (almoſt numberleſs) varieties of this
kind among the Heathen. The Inſtance is plain enough, in thoſe
that profeſſed the name of the true God, they were ſtill changing
for <hi>new Faſhions</hi> in Religon, borrowing <hi>Patterns</hi> from their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
ſo that if there were but a new <hi>Altar</hi> at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> or a new
Idol in any ſtrange City, they muſt preſently have the like, till
(as the Prophet tells them) <hi>according to their Cities ſo were their Gods.</hi>
He that will call to mind, that the Husbandman did firſt <hi>ſow good
Seed in his Field,</hi> and that there is ſuch Varieity of <hi>Tares</hi> and falſe
Worſhip, notwithſtanding the plain and poſitive Command of
God, fixing and determining his Worſhip, muſt needs conclude
that an <hi>Enemy,</hi> Satan hath done it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If we call to mind, how in all Ages there hath been
a <hi>conſtancy</hi> in this inconſtant Variety, we hear of it among the
<hi>Heathens.</hi> We read enough of it among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
when they were out of the humour of more ſhameful <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
they yet corrupted the Worſhip of God by their <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
and of theſe they were ſo <hi>fond,</hi> that they cauſed the Law of
God it ſelf to give place to them, and made it <hi>void</hi> by them. The
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49412:300"/>
times of the Goſpel were not free; though Chriſt came to ſeek
ſuch Worſhippers, as ſhould <hi>worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> yet
before the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Deaths, while yet they were perſwading to the
contrary, there aroſe up ſome that corrupted the Worſhip, by
leading the People back again to the <hi>Jewiſh Ceremonies,</hi> and others
laboured to bring in <hi>worſhipping of Angels,</hi> and at laſt to <hi>eat things
offered to Idols</hi> with greater defilements. Since the Apoſtles days
the ſame Deſign hath been carried on in the Churches. <hi>Rome</hi> hath
patched together a great deal of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
and when the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> ſhall be revealed, yet an higher
Flood of ſuch Abominations is to be expected. Who hath
wrought all this but Satan? this is ſtill the ſame deſign, and
though the work be not in <hi>all parts</hi> like it ſelf, yet the whole of it
evidenceth the working of the <hi>ſame</hi> Spirit in all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Let us obſerve how <hi>early</hi> this began. We cannot ſay,
but that in the days of <hi>Adam,</hi> (who doubtleſs had received parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Commands from God, in which he would not fail to inſtruct
his Children;) they were ſeeking to themſelves <hi>many Inventions.
Gen.</hi> 4. 26. At the Birth of <hi>Enos</hi> (as ſome conjecture) there were
ſuch defilements brought into uſe in Worſhip, that <hi>Seth</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to it when he called his Son <hi>Enos</hi> Sorrowful, as <hi>lamenting</hi>
that <hi>Prophanation</hi> which was then begun in <hi>calling upon the Name of
the Lord,</hi> for ſo do many interpret that Paſſage, which in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
we read thus, <hi>Then began Men to call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi>
the word in the <hi>Original</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which ſignifieth both to <hi>prophane,</hi>
and to <hi>begin,</hi> and may be as properly tranſlated, then <hi>prophaned
they in calling upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> And there are ſeveral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that move learned Men to fix upon this Tranſlation:<note place="margin">Druſius. Lightfoot. Tremel. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> As (1.)
That it is not probable that Men began <hi>then</hi> to call upon God,
or <hi>publickly</hi> to do ſo (as ſome would interpret) and <hi>not before,</hi> as the
preſent <hi>Engliſh</hi> would imply. (2.) That Age was noted as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
and therefore it is noted (as a rarity) that <hi>Enoch</hi> walked
with God. (3.) The <hi>Rabbins</hi> generally tranſlate <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane;
but if we ſhould grant the preſent <hi>Engliſh, Then began Men
to call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> It would imply that the Worſhip
practiſed by <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> had <hi>been corrupted,</hi> and now it was <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored</hi>
again and reformed, which will make the Corruption of
Worſhip to be yet more early. And after that we read of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
crept into the Family of <hi>Seth</hi> (as well as now in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Cain)</hi> ſo that the Worſhip of God ſtood not long in its Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 2.</note>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:49412:300"/>
though <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> were alive to inſtruct them; which
ſhews that it was a rebellious departure from the way, fomented
and brought on by the malignant Spirit Satan.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, But to make all ſure, the Scripture lays all theſe kinds
of corruption of Worſhip at <hi>Satan's</hi> Door. The defilements of
Worſhip taught in <hi>Thyatira</hi> by <hi>Jezebel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 24.</note> are called the <hi>depths of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 9.</note> the Corruptions introduced by <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> are from <hi>the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Satan.</hi> What was promoted by falſe Apoſtles to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they had it from their great Teacher Satan,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 13, 14.</note> who <hi>transforms
himſelf</hi> for ſuch ends <hi>into an Angel of Light:</hi> ſo that nothing can
be more plain than that this is an old and conſtant Deſign of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>
                     <p>The particular ways by which Satan effects this Deſign I ſhall
not now touch, but ſhall in lieu of that give you the reaſons of
his endeavours this way.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He knows that this is a Sin of an <hi>high provocation.</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is the proper <hi>Tribute</hi> that is due to God, and 'tis peculiarly his
<hi>Prerogative</hi> to <hi>preſcribe</hi> the way and manner of it; neither of theſe
<hi>Honours</hi> will he <hi>give to any other,</hi> but will expreſs his jealouſy when
any invaſion is made upon theſe his <hi>ſole Prerogatives.</hi> Now his
Worſhip cannot be corrupted, but <hi>one</hi> of theſe at leaſt will in ſome
<hi>degree</hi> or other be <hi>touched.</hi> If we ſet up <hi>another Object</hi> of Worſhip, we
<hi>deny</hi> him to be <hi>God:</hi> if we worſhip him in a <hi>way</hi> of our <hi>own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi>
we <hi>deny</hi> his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and ſet up our ſelves above him, as
if we could <hi>order</hi> his Worſhip <hi>better</hi> than he hath done in his
<hi>Word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, If the Worſhip be corrupted, all the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the
Affections of the Heart, and all the <hi>Service</hi> it ſelf is <hi>loſt,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unacceptable; he knows that ſuch Worſhippers ſhall meet
with this Anſwer, <hi>who hath required this at your hands?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Corruption in Worſhip, Satan by long experience
knows to have been the ground of thoſe <hi>hatreds,</hi> quarrels, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
and troubles under which the Church hath groaned in all
ages, every <hi>difference</hi> impoſing their way and <hi>perſwaſion</hi> upon all
<hi>diſſenters,</hi> to the <hi>diſturbance</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> breach and decay of <hi>Love,</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
of the growth of <hi>Piety,</hi> to the <hi>biting</hi> and devouring of one
another.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Beſides God is provoked by this to <hi>leave his Sanctuary,</hi>
to remove his Glory and his <hi>Candleſtick;</hi> to make his Vineyard a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,
and his Churches as <hi>Shilob.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:49412:301"/>
Fifthly, Satan is the more induſtrious in this, becauſe his ways
are capable of many <hi>advantages</hi> to further his deſign, and many
<hi>ſpecious pretences</hi> to cover it. In <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. he made uſe of <hi>Philoſophy</hi>
to corrupt Religion, and by unſound Principles of ſome Heathens
famous for that Learning, introduced <hi>worſhipping of Angels;</hi> what
that could not effect he laboured to perform by the <hi>Traditions of
Men,</hi> and where that came ſhort, the <hi>rudiments of the World</hi> (the
Moſaical Ceremonies were ſo called here, and in the Epiſtle to
the <hi>Hebrews)</hi> were his Engine by which he battered the plain
Worſhip of the New Teſtament. And as to pretences the Apoſtle
doth there, and elſewhere note, that <hi>Deceny</hi> and <hi>Order, Humility,
Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> are things very taking, and yet uſually
pretended for ſuch bold <hi>Innovations</hi> as may corrupt the pure ſtreams
of the Sanctuary.</p>
                     <p>Hence may I leave with you a few Memorials.<note place="margin">Applic.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, This may make us <hi>jealous</hi> of any alterations in the way of
God's Worſhip. We have reaſon under the moſt plauſible pretexts
to ſuſpect the hand of Satan, becauſe 'tis one of his main buſineſſes
to corrupt the Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This may juſtify thoſe that out of a <hi>conſcientious
fear</hi> of complying with Satans deſign, dare not admit of a <hi>Pin in
the Tabornacle</hi> beſide what God hath preſcribed, nor leave behind
a <hi>Shoe Latchet</hi> of what he hath enjoyned.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This will tell us that that Worſhip is <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>ſafeſt</hi> that
hath <hi>leaſt of Mixture</hi> of <hi>humane Invention.</hi> We cannot offend in
keeping cloſe to the Rule, though the Worſhip thereby become
more <hi>plain,</hi> and not ſo <hi>gorgeous</hi> in outward appearance. We may
ſoon <hi>overdo</hi> it by the leaſt <hi>addition,</hi> and cannot be ſo certain of God's
<hi>acceptation,</hi> as we are of pleaſing the <hi>Senſes</hi> of Men by ſuch intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This motion of Satan,</hi> Fall down and worſhip me, <hi>is now in the
laſt place to be conſidered as a particular inſtance of Satans</hi> general
<hi>deſign,</hi> of drawing the hearts of Men from God, his Service and
ways, to the pleaſures of Sin: <hi>as if he ſhould ſay to him,</hi> follow my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
give up thy ſelf to my Service, and thou ſhalt be gratified with all
the delights that the World can give thee: <hi>to this doth the bait here
offered moſt fitly agree. Hence Obſerve,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That it is Satans general deſign to withdraw the hearts of Men from
God,<note place="margin">Obſ. 8.</note> that they may be enſlaved to him in the Service of Sin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:49412:301"/>
That the Devil doth level all his endeavours to this, cannot be
doubted: For (1.) he hath a <hi>Kingdom</hi> in this World, from which
he is denominated the <hi>Prince of this World.</hi> And this is not only a
rule of <hi>Exteriour</hi> force, ſuch as Conquerous have over their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
Slaves, who are compelled to ſubject their Bodies, while
yet their minds are full of hatred againſt him, who hath thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them to ſubjection; but it is a rule over the <hi>Hearts</hi> and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of Men, working in the <hi>Children of Diſobedience</hi> a love and
liking of theſe ways, and begetting in them the <hi>Image</hi> of Satan;
ſo that what work he impoſeth they are pleaſed withal, and <hi>love
to have it ſo:</hi> Therefore he is not only called their <hi>Prince,</hi> but their
<hi>God,</hi> and their <hi>Father; Ye are of your Father the Devil,</hi> in that with
a kind of <hi>inward devotion</hi> they will and endeavour to perform the
<hi>Luſts</hi> which he propounds to them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This Kingdom is <hi>contrary</hi> to God's <hi>Spiritual</hi> Kingdom;
that being of Darkneſs, this of Light: and it is managed by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
with an envious competition and <hi>Corrivalſhip</hi> to that of God;
ſo that as God invites Men to the Happineſs of his Kingdom, and
ſends his Spirit in his Word and Ordinances to perſwade them,
Satan doth the like, he ſends out his Spirit which the Apoſtle calls
<hi>the Spirit of the World, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 12. and imploys all his Agents to
engage Men for him; he <hi>requires the Heart</hi> as God doth, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
his <hi>rewards</hi> of Pleaſure, Honour, Riches, if they will fall down
and worſhip him. Now 'tis ſo natural to proſecute an <hi>Intereſt</hi>
thus <hi>eſpouſed</hi> in a way of <hi>oppoſition,</hi> eſpecially to any other that ſet
up for themſelves in a contradictory Competitorſhip, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
natural Laws of Satans Kingdom will engage him to ſtand up
for it, and to enlarge it all he can.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe upon whom he prevails are of two ſorts.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Some are <hi>viſibly</hi> in his Service: theſe anſwer the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
which was given of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 Kings 21. 20. <hi>Who ſold himſelf
to work Wickedneſs in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> expreſſion ſhews,
that ſuch are <hi>wholly</hi> in Satans Power and Diſpoſal, as things <hi>ſold</hi>
are in the Poſſeſſion and Power of the <hi>Buyer,</hi> they are at
Satans will; if he ſay to them, <hi>Go, they go:</hi> and if he ſay, <hi>Come, they
come:</hi> their Bodies and Spirits are Satan's, they are not their own:
and they are his for the ends of Sin, for that imployment only,
ſo that they are <hi>wholly corrupt and abominable.</hi> The <hi>latter</hi> expreſſion
that he did ſo in the <hi>Sight of the Lord,</hi> manifeſts their <hi>ſhameleſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency</hi>
in Sin, that they <hi>declare their Sin as</hi> Sodom, <hi>and hide it not,</hi>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:49412:302"/>
that they do not Bluſh, but openly wear the Devils Livery, and
avouch his Service: As the <hi>works of the Fleſh are manifeſt,</hi> ſo theſe in
their practice of ſuch works, are <hi>manifeſtly</hi> Satans Subjects. Theſe
kind of Men are frequently in the Old Teſtament ſtiled <hi>Sons of
Belial,</hi>

themſelves to the Devils Service, in that they reject the Yoke of
God's Law, in that they <hi>break his Bonds, and caſt his Cords from
them,</hi> or their <hi>Pride</hi> that they will have none above them, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that there is a God, or that the moſt High rules, or their
<hi>averſneſs</hi> to what is good, being <hi>wholly unprofitable, and to every good
work reprobate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Some are <hi>ſecretly</hi> his Servants, they come to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
(as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did to Chriſt) by Night; they will not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profeſs him, but yet their hearts are wholly his: ſuch are called
by the name of <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> The Phariſees and Scribes ſeemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
for God, called themſelves <hi>Abrahams Seed,</hi> Faſted, gave
Alms, made long Prayers; and yet were a <hi>Generation of Vipers,</hi> and
<hi>of their Father the Devil.</hi> The ſecreſy of this underhand engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Hell is ſuch, that many who are in a league with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and at an agreement with Death, do neither know nor believe
it concerning themſelves. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This private Covenant may be, where there are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
ſeeming <hi>deſilements</hi> of Satan, and high <hi>Profeſſions</hi> of Service to
God. The Phariſees (as have been ſaid) were the Devils Servants,
under all the fair ſhew they made of Religion, and zeal for the
Law, and yet when Chriſt plainly told them that they were not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
Seed, but the Devils Seed, they with high indignation and
ſcorn throw back the accuſation to Chriſt, <hi>Thou art a Samaritan, and
haſt a Devil,</hi> we are <hi>Abraham's Children;</hi> ſo little believed they the
truth when it was told them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This may conſiſt with ſome <hi>deſignement</hi> and intention
to give God Glory. The <hi>Jews</hi> though they ſubmitted not to the
Righteouſneſs of God, yet (by the Teſtimony of <hi>Paul)</hi> they had
a <hi>Zeal to God.</hi> The very Heathens that ſacrifice to Devils; had not
<hi>formal</hi> intentions ſo to do, as appears by their inſcription on the
Altar at <hi>Athens,</hi> Acts 17. 23. <hi>To the unknown God.</hi> The true God,
though unknown, they propounded as the Object of their Worſhip,
yet falling into thoſe ways of devotion which the Devil had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
theſe <hi>intentions</hi> could not hinder but that they became his
<hi>Servants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:49412:302"/>
Thirdly, Men may be Servants to Satan under great <hi>aſſurances</hi>
and confidences of their <hi>Intereſt</hi> in God; many go to Hell that
have lived with <hi>Lord, Lord</hi> in their Mouths; thoſe mentioned in
<hi>Eſa.</hi> 48. 2. that had no intereſt in Truth and Righteouſneſs when
they ſolemnly ſware by the name of the Lord, yet <hi>they called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of the Holy City, and ſtayed themſelves upon the God of</hi>
Iſrael.</p>
                     <p>If it ſeem ſtrange to any that theſe Profeſſions,<note place="margin">Object.</note> Intentions, and
Confidences are not enough to ſecure Men from this charge, but
that they may be ſecretly Slaves to Hell. I Anſwer,</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> That thoſe do not neceſſarily conclude that the Heart of
ſuch Men is <hi>right with God.</hi> Formality, natural Conſcience, and
the power of Education may do much of this: for though we
grant that ſuch are not <hi>conſcious</hi> to themſelves of any real deſign of
ſerving Satan, yet they may either ſo far miſs it in the <hi>way</hi> of their
Service, offering that as well pleaſing to God, which indeed he
hates (and that through wilful and affected Ignorance;) as thoſe of
whom Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 2. that ſhould think the <hi>killing</hi> of
God's Children a peice of acceptable <hi>Service;</hi> Or they may be ſo
miſtaken as to the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of their Hearts, that they may think
they have a deſign to pleaſe God in doing of what he requires in
order thereunto, when indeed it may not be ſingly <hi>for God,</hi> but <hi>for
themſelves</hi> that they work, in a ſelf-gratification of their <hi>natural
Zeal</hi> for their way; or their <hi>Eſteem,</hi> Credit, and <hi>Advantage</hi> may pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
influence them, rather than a <hi>Spirit of Life and Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>work</hi> which they do, and the <hi>Ends</hi> they ſerve,
will be evidence againſt profeſſions and intentions. 'Tis a ſure rule,
that <hi>the work ſhews to whom Men are related as Servants,</hi> and it is laid
down as a certain <hi>Standard</hi> to meaſure the Hearts of Men by, when
pretences and perſwaſions ſeem to carry all before them. Rom. 6.
16. <hi>His Servants ye are to whom you obey.</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 8, 10. <hi>He that
committeth Sin is of the Devil: in this the Children of God are manifeſt,
and the Children of the Devil;</hi> that is, when it becomes a queſtion
to whom a Man belongs, whoſe Child and Servant he is, it muſt
be determined by the works he doth: if he engage in the ways of
Sin, he is of the Devil, let him profeſs what he will to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
This ſame Ballance Chriſt uſeth to try the truth of the <hi>Jews</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
to God, Joh. 8. 34. <hi>Whoſoever committeth Sin, is the Servant
of Sin;</hi> they boaſted high, but he ſhews them that ſeeing their
deſigns and works were Hatred, Envy, Murther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49412:303"/>
apparently from Satan, it was evident they had learned theſe of
him; and he concludes by this proof, ver. 44. <hi>that they were of
their Father the Devil.</hi> Thus may we ſay of thoſe that pretend they
honour God, they defie the Devil, they intend well, if yet they
give themſelves up to the pleaſing of the Fleſh, if worldly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if they live in Pride, Strife, Envy, Maliciouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
are works of the Devil, it is not all their pretences that will inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
them to God; but they are (for all this) the Devils Servants,
as doing his works.</p>
                     <p>This may put Men upon enquiries,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> who are ye for? whoſe
Servants are ye? There are but two that can lay claim to you, and
theſe two divide the whole World betwixt them, there is no ſtate
of <hi>Neutrality,</hi> you are either God's Servants, or the Devils, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſerve them both; now if <hi>the Lord be God, ſerve him.</hi> Satan's
Service is Baſe, Diſhonourable, Slaviſh; the Service of God, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Honour, Life and Peace: there is indeed no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them. Happy then is that Man that can ſay the Lord is his
Lot and Portion, that can come into God's Preſence, and there
in his Integrity, avouch the Lord for his God; that can ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, <hi>My Soul hath ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my God,</hi> and <hi>I have
none beſides thee; other Lords have had dominion over us, but we will
make mention of thy Name only.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Temptation though it were in it ſelf horrid, and as a
Brood of Vipers knotted together, which at once could ſend out
ſeveral ſtings, and make many wounds (as hath been noted;) yet
in the way of propounding, Satan ſeems to inſinuate the <hi>largeneſs</hi>
of his proffer, and the <hi>ſmalneſs</hi> and inconſiderableneſs of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
required: as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>See how free I am in my Kindneſs,
I will not ſtick to give thee the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of
them, and all this for ſo ſmall a matter, as bowing before me, or doing
me a little Reverence.</hi> This gives us to Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That when Satan doth deſign no leſs than to enſlave Men to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 9</note> 
                        <hi>yet he will propound Sin as a ſmall thing, or but one act of Sin, as
a thing not valuable, to engage them to him.</hi> Not but that he deſires
to run Men to exceſs in Wickedneſs, and delights to ſee them
with <hi>both hands earneſtly</hi> work Iniquity with <hi>greedineſs;</hi> yet where
he ſees the Conſciences of Men ſquemiſh, and that they cannot
bear Temptations to open and <hi>common</hi> Prophaneneſs without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of <hi>revolt</hi> from him, there he ſeems <hi>modeſt,</hi> and requires but
ſome ſmall thing at leaſt at firſt, till the ways of Sin become more
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49412:303"/>
                        <hi>familiar</hi> to them, and then when they can better bear it, he
doubles the <hi>tale of Bricks,</hi> and with greater confidence can urge them
to things of greater Shame and Enormity. That this is his way,
appears,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, from the common Argument which he uſeth at firſt to
thoſe whom he would draw off from a more careful Converſation
which is this: Do ſuch a thing, it's but for <hi>once,</hi> and but <hi>little,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do <hi>the like</hi> and demur not; or the <hi>beſt</hi> do as great matters as this
comes to; 'tis but a ſmall thing, conſidering the <hi>Strait</hi> or the
<hi>Advantage</hi> that may accrew. This is his uſual <hi>Note</hi> to <hi>candidate</hi> Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
as experience of all doth teſtify.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That this is ſo, is alſo evident from a Conſideration
of the ſeveral <hi>ways</hi> and courſes of Sinners. Some are tempted
and overcome by <hi>one kind</hi> of Sin, and <hi>not at all</hi> urged to others.
Some go to Hell in a way of Covetouſneſs: Others are pretty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable
in moſt of their carriages, but are overcome by a proud
Humour: Others are given to Drink, and yet will not Steal nor
deal falſely: Others take a more cleanly way to Hell, rely upon
their own Righteouſneſs, or are engaged in Error, and their Life
otherwiſe ſmooth and fair. The <hi>Jews</hi> in Chriſt's time were only
engaged againſt Chriſt, and for their Traditions, but not mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
with Temptations to open Idolatry as formerly. Thoſe who
are Ignorant, are not troubled with Temptations to deſpair,
or inward Terrours. The Reaſons of his dealing thus are
theſe;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He ſees that one Sin <hi>heartily</hi> proſecuted, is enough to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
<hi>Homage</hi> to him, and to give him Poſſeſſion. As we take Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of Land by a Turf, or a Twig: ſo by one Sin admitted
with <hi>full</hi> purpoſe of Mind, Satan is let into the Heart. As a Penny
will be ſufficient earneſt for a Bargain of a thouſand Pound: ſo
may one Sin be a <hi>Pledg</hi> or earneſt for the <hi>whole Soul</hi> in a <hi>League</hi>
with Hell.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He knows that one Sin perſiſted in may be enough
to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the Soul; as one <hi>Wound</hi> may Kill, one <hi>Leak</hi> may ſink a
Ship.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He knows that one Sin <hi>breaks</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God,
and turns the Heart from him, if Men <hi>give</hi> up themſelves to
it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, One Sin <hi>wilfully</hi> purſued, makes a Man guilty of the
Breach of the <hi>whole Law,</hi> it deſtroys love and reſpect to God,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49412:304"/>
undervalues his Authority, contemns his Threatnings and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, One Sin is enough to make <hi>way</hi> for <hi>more,</hi> where Satan
would have more, yet at firſt he is pleaſed with it as a <hi>hopeful</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;
it makes room enough for the Serpents Head, and then
he will afterward eaſily wind in his whole Body.</p>
                     <p>This may warn us not to be imboldned to any Sin by the plea
of <hi>diminution;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Applic.</note> not to venture becauſe it may ſeem little, or be
but for once. A true Chriſtian ſhould be a perfect <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſaliſt,</hi> he
ſhould be univerſally <hi>againſt all Sin,</hi> and univerſally <hi>for All
Duty.</hi>

                     <p>I Come now to the Argument which Satan uſed for all this, <hi>All

and ſeeks to entangle him by Worldly Greatneſs and Delight. I

what is in it, that fits it ſo much for his purpoſe. The firſt
of theſe is evidenced by theſe particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Scripture doth particularly note to us, a <hi>Deceit</hi> or
Guile to be in Worldly Pleaſures. Chriſt, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 22. ſpeaks
of the <hi>deceitfulneſs of Riches;</hi> and that deceit is expreſſed by ſuch a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49412:304"/>

he means not the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of theſe delights (in which ſence 'tis
ſaid, <hi>that Riches take themſelves Wings and fly away,)</hi> which often
diſappoint and deceive the expectations of thoſe that do moſt hug
them. Nor can this be underſtood of Riches in an <hi>active ſenſe,</hi> as
we attribute deceit to Men, who as rational agents can <hi>contrive</hi> and
deviſe Snares; but it only means that theſe are ſo <hi>Objectivè,</hi> as
things that are <hi>abuſed</hi> by Satan, to <hi>delude</hi> and betray the Sons of
Men. And theſe are ſo frequently made uſe of by him for ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
and with ſuch advantages of Power and Provocation, that
Chriſt elſewhere <hi>(Matth. 19. 23.)</hi> ſpeaks of it as a thing almoſt
impoſſible, to have Riches and not to be enſnared by them: <hi>A
rich Man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which <hi>Mark</hi>
and <hi>Luke</hi> expreſs by an affectionate amazement, <hi>O how hardly can
a rich Man be ſaved!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Theſe are Satans <hi>great Net,</hi> which incloſeth Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes;
a <hi>general</hi> Bait, by which moſt are hooked into the Service of
Sin. Moſt Temptations come from this Ocean, as Springs from
the Sea; <hi>the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eys, the Pride of Life,</hi>
have their Original from the <hi>World, 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 16. Chriſt ſpeaks of
this <hi>Mammon of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> as the only thing that ſtands up in
competition for the Hearts of Men againſt God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 24.
and the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. reckoning up the various ways of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Luſts, as Covetouſneſs, Boaſting, Pride, Blaſpheming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
concludes them all under this, <hi>that they are lovers of Pleaſures more
than lovers of God;</hi> ſhewing us thereby, that though the Luſts of
Men might run out <hi>diverſe</hi> ways, and be exerciſed upon diverſe
particular Objects, yet they all borrow their <hi>Original</hi> from Worldly
<hi>Pleaſures,</hi> and their deſign is nothing but that in the general.
Hence is it that ſome make the World the great <hi>Traytor</hi> to God; for
though they reckon up <hi>three</hi> great Enemies to God and Man, the
<hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> yet <hi>theſe three agree in one,</hi> the
<hi>pleaſing of the Fleſh</hi> is the great <hi>end</hi> and deſire of natural Men, the
World is the <hi>Store-houſe,</hi> from which Men draw out ſeveral Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
according to the ſeveral ways they take in gratifying their
Luſts and Humours, and the Devil is only officious to help all this
forward, by inticing and perſwading them to <hi>make</hi> theſe <hi>proviſions
for the Fleſh.</hi> And who can think other, but that this muſt be
Satans great <hi>Engine,</hi> when (as hath been ſaid) firſt, the World,
and the Pleaſures of it, is the <hi>ſum</hi> of all Iniquity, containing in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49412:305"/>
it <hi>virtually</hi> or <hi>actually</hi> the Tranſgreſſion of the whole Law, the <hi>root</hi>
it is <hi>of all evil, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 10. all prophaneneſs againſt God, all
neglect of Duty, all Outrage, Wrong, or Injuſtice to Man, may
(and uſually doth) ſpring from hence, inſomuch that ſome have
particularly traced it through <hi>every</hi> Command of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and
found it guilty (either as <hi>Principal</hi> or <hi>Acceſſary)</hi> of every Iniquity.
(2.) Our thoughts may be the more confirmed in this, when we
ſee all Men <hi>intangled</hi> by it: for albeit that <hi>ſome</hi> Temptations ſeem
<hi>directly</hi> to carry Men <hi>from a love</hi> or care of the World, as Deſpair,
terrours of Mind, voluntary Humility, neglecting of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and others of the ſame kind; yet if the matter be conſidered,
the truth in hand cannot be <hi>prejudiced</hi> by ſuch an objection. For
(1.) thoſe who ſeem in <hi>diſtreſs</hi> of Conſcience moſt to <hi>loath</hi> the
World, were yet <hi>firſt</hi> entangled by it, and the conſideration of that
<hi>Guilt</hi> (whether at preſent juſtly, or unjuſtly charged upon them)
is the uſual <hi>occaſion</hi> of theſe troubles. And (2.) thoſe who ſeem
to <hi>undervalue</hi> Money, Riches, Plenty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are (it may be) no
leſs Slaves to <hi>other</hi> Worldly Luſts; for Pleaſures of the World <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend</hi>
whatſoever may ariſe from <hi>any</hi> thing that is in the World,
to the delight of Life. Honour, Pride, Ambition, Prodigality,
are <hi>wordly Luſts,</hi> as well as Covetouſneſs, and deſire of Power or
Rule. And thoſe that ſeem to deny themſelves of <hi>faring delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,</hi>
or <hi>wearing ſoft Rayment,</hi> may be as much diſtreſſed with an
inward deſire of <hi>Applauſe</hi> and Honour, as thoſe that would gratify
their <hi>Senſes</hi> are by ſenſual Luſts.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, How much the World ſtands Satan in ſtead, may be
obſerved from the <hi>force</hi> of that Temptation, upon thoſe that have
very much <hi>engaged</hi> in their <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of the ways of God; it hath
often fetch'd off thoſe that ſeemed to have given up themſelves
to God. <hi>Demas</hi> was once commended by <hi>Paul</hi> as his Fellow-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer,
<hi>Philem. v.</hi> 24. yet at laſt it ſo prevailed upon him, that he
complained, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. that <hi>Demas had forſaken him,</hi> and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his back upon his Profeſſion, and ſo far (if <hi>Dorotheus</hi> do him
right) that he became an <hi>Idol-Prieſt</hi> in <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> the cauſe of
which horrid Apoſtacy was his <hi>love to the preſent World. Balaam</hi>
ſeemed reſolute not to act any thing againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet the <hi>ways of
unrighteouſneſs</hi> ſo far blinded him that <hi>he taught</hi> Balak <hi>to caſt a
ſtumbling block before the Children of</hi> Iſrael. The <hi>higheſt</hi> of nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Profeſſors noted by the <hi>thorny ground,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 22. who
ſeemed to differ from the good ground, only in this, that their
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49412:305"/>
Fruit was <hi>green</hi> and not <hi>ripe</hi> (as <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſeth it) <hi>they brought
not Fruit to Perfection:</hi> They were <hi>choaked</hi> in theſe fair beginnings
and offers for Holineſs, by the <hi>Cares</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures of the World.</hi> All
Ages abound with inſtances of this kind. <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> preached
againſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſet up the Council above him, commended the
<hi>Germans</hi> for oppoſing him: but Preferment made him alter his
note, and at laſt he became <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf. <hi>Bonner</hi> the Perſecutor
ſeemed at firſt a <hi>good Man,</hi> a Favourer of <hi>Luther's</hi> Doctrine, but
advancement changed him to a bloody <hi>Woolf,</hi> a cruel <hi>Tygar. Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lato</hi>
forſook <hi>Popery,</hi> but (miſſing thoſe Dignities which he aimed at
in <hi>England)</hi> was upon hopes of greater preferment, induced to
lick up his Vomit, and to own <hi>Popery</hi> again. How many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
have we of thoſe who the <hi>higher</hi> they grew in the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more <hi>careleſs</hi> of Religion; as <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> who went
as faſt <hi>back</hi> in Religion, as he went <hi>forward</hi> in Promotion: ſo
that he that at firſt entring into Orders, had a <hi>good hope</hi> of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
by that time he came to be <hi>Pope,</hi> he became ſo wicked
that he <hi>deſpaired</hi> of Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, This Temptation is one of Satan's <hi>laſt Refuges,</hi> and
often prevails where <hi>Perſecution</hi> cannot. The Thorny-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearers
were above thoſe of the Stony-ground in this, that they
ſtood out the <hi>Storm,</hi> and bore the <hi>ſcorching Heat</hi> of Perſecution,
but then the <hi>World choaked</hi> them. Sad experience tells us, that
Churches that did thrive and grow as the <hi>Palm-tree</hi> under their
<hi>Preſſures,</hi> were ſpoiled by <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>plenty,</hi> which ſo cheriſhed the
Seeds of Pride, Vanity, and Contention, that they grew up a-main,
and did more to their deſolation, than the cruelty of all their feir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt
Enemies. <hi>Julian</hi> who by the greateſt Art and Policy, ſtudied
to overthrow the Chriſtians name,<note place="margin">Honoribus magis Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes provocare quam tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Cogere ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit. <hi>Nazian.</hi>
                        </note> ſo obſerved this, that he made
it his rule, <hi>rather to corrupt Men by Honours, then to compel them by
Torments:</hi> we have alſo found that though the <hi>Romans</hi> Synagogue
joyn <hi>force</hi> to <hi>Subtilty</hi> in the advancement of their <hi>Dagon,</hi> yet they
have ſtill looked upon <hi>this</hi> Temptation of the <hi>World</hi> as moſt likely
to <hi>gain</hi> the Hearts of their rational oppoſers: <hi>Cruelty</hi> could over-aw
the <hi>Senſleſs</hi> Multitude, and could take out of the way thoſe of
whoſe oppoſition they were affraid, but it ſeldom with ſucceſs,
wrought upon Perſons (guided by Light and Conſcience) to a
<hi>compliance,</hi> that would <hi>hold</hi> long: for though at firſt ſome good
Men were <hi>over-awed</hi> to make ſubſcription and to recant,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Fox</hi> Acts and Mon.</note> as it did
with <hi>Bilney, Bainham, Cranmer,</hi> and ſeveral others; yet upon the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49412:306"/>
working of <hi>Conſcience</hi> (after the ſtound and dazle of the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was over) they <hi>recoiled</hi> ſo reſolutely upon them, that they loſt
more than they gained that way: But thoſe that were willing to
<hi>nibble</hi> at preferments, became theirs <hi>wholly.</hi> Thus they ſet upon
<hi>Luther, Galeacous Carracciolus, Dr. Taylor,</hi> and a great many more
though to no purpoſe, for they were ready to bid their <hi>Money pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
with them,</hi> and to bid defiance to their Favour as well as to
their Frowns. Notwithſtanding they have made many real <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts</hi>
by this Weapon, and accordingly this is reckoned among the
Temptations of greateſt force, Heb. 11. 37. <hi>They were ſtoned, they
were ſawn aſunder, they were tempted,</hi> that is, by the Pleaſures and
Preferments of the World: it ſeems the Holy Ghoſt would point at
this (how fair and plauſible ſoever it be) as one of the Devil's
moſt powerful Engines.</p>
                     <p>Next I promiſed to diſcover what it is in the World which
makes it ſo fit for Satan's deſigns.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The World brings or affords fit matter to be made the
<hi>Fewel</hi> of Luſt.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 16.</note> For this reaſon the Apoſtle in the place aforecited
forbids us ſo earneſtly to love the World, or the things of the
World, becauſe there is nothing in it which is not <hi>improveable,</hi> as
an occaſion, or Provocation to Luſt, <hi>Whatſoever is in the World is
Luſt of Fleſh</hi> or <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Heart;</hi> and there is no Luſt but it may be
furniſhed with a proper Object from hence, the Appetite, Senſes,
or Affections fetch all their delights from hence.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Beſides the common <hi>Materials</hi> of Sin that are digged
out of this <hi>Mine,</hi> the World hath ſomething of an <hi>aptitude</hi> in it to
tempt. Not that it hath <hi>properly</hi> and formally, <hi>inſidiationis animum,</hi>
an <hi>active</hi> Subtilty to lay ſnares for Men, but yet it is not ſo <hi>purely
paſſive,</hi> as to make it altogether Innocent. There is ſomething of a
<hi>Curſe</hi> upon it, ever ſince by the fall of Man, it was looſned from
its proper primitive ends; and as the Devil ſpake by the Serpent,
ſo doth he urge, ſpeak, tempt, and inſinuate <hi>by the World,</hi> ſo that
it is ſtill an occaſion of danger to us, and hath a ſpecial advantage
over our affections upon ſeveral accounts. As (1.) in that it is
in its ſelf <hi>lawful</hi> to be uſed. (2.) In that it is <hi>ſuitable</hi> to our deſires
and tempers. (3.) In ſome reſpects it might be <hi>neceſſary</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
for the <hi>comfort</hi> of Life, for the ſupport of Families, and
to enable us to be helpful to others. (4.) It is <hi>near</hi> to us, under
our Eye, we have familiar converſe with it, it is ſtill with us. (5.)
We have a <hi>natural propenſity</hi> to be in love with it; the Fleſh would
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49412:306"/>
fain be pleaſed, and nothing is more anſwerable to it than the
pleaſures of the World. We need not wonder then, when we ſee
it ſo highly <hi>captivating</hi> the affections of Men, and leading them
bound in <hi>Chains</hi> and Fetters:<note place="margin">pſal. 17. 14.</note> Some make it their <hi>God, Gain</hi> is all
their <hi>Godlineſs</hi> and Religion; they ſeek their <hi>Portion in this Life;</hi>
this is their <hi>Treaſure,</hi> and here is their <hi>Heart,</hi> and it would be no
leſs wonder if Satan ſhould be guilty of ſo much overſight, as to
neglect the uſe of an Inſtrument which is every way ſo fitted for
his purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Beſides this fair proſpect which it gives to Sin, it hath
an <hi>enmity</hi> to God and his ways, which is no leſs advantagious to the
Devil: This is poſitively affirmed <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 4. the <hi>Friendſhip of this
World, is Enmity with God;</hi> not only is this true in a lower ſenſe,
as a <hi>hinderance,</hi> being backward and averſe to it, but it is a <hi>direct</hi>
oppoſition and contrariety to God and his Service; its <hi>drawing</hi>
back and hindring, is charge enough againſt it: for it (1.) <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws
thoſe</hi> thoughts, affections, time, care, and endeavours,
which ſhould be laid out upon <hi>better</hi> things, ſo that Holineſs muſt
needs be obſtructed, dwindle and decay by it. (2.) It <hi>hinders</hi> the
<hi>influence</hi> of Heaven, it ſhuts out the light <hi>cauſally,</hi> quencheth and
reſiſteth the Spirit, and <hi>meritoriouſly</hi> alſo it provokes God to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
to remove his Glory, and to give over his ſtriving with them:
But the contrariety that it hath to all the <hi>parts</hi> of Holineſs is yet
more, Chriſt notes it <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 24. Theſe <hi>two Maſters,</hi> God and
the World, are <hi>contrary</hi> in their <hi>Deiſigns,</hi> in their <hi>Commands,</hi> in their
<hi>Natures,</hi> ſo that it is impoſſible for any Man to ſerve them both:
they <hi>both</hi> require the <hi>Heart,</hi> and they <hi>both</hi> require it to contrary
and <hi>incompitable</hi> Services and Ends: Theſe then are ſuch Maſters,
as would be <hi>Domini in Solidum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Grotius</hi> in loc.</note> Maſters of the whole. Now there
cannot be <hi>two Maſters</hi> of <hi>one thing</hi> in that ſenſe, neither (if there
were) could the Hearts of Men ſerve theſe different commands,
but their work would neceſſarily engage their affections to one
only; they would <hi>either love the one and hate the other, or hold to the
one and deſpiſe the other:</hi> This very conſideration (if there were no
more) doth render the World a deſirable Inſtrument for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In all this the World hath ſo many <hi>Cunning Diſguiſes,</hi>
and plauſible <hi>Shifts,</hi> that it becomes thereby wonderfully ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Satan. 'Tis the perfection of wicked <hi>Policy,</hi> to manage
wicked deſigns under <hi>plauſible</hi> pretences; theſe the World hath in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49412:307"/>
readineſs, when 'tis accuſed of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and Treachery againſt God;
The pleas of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> of Proſecution of a <hi>lawful</hi> Calling, of <hi>providing</hi>
for a Family, of not <hi>neglecting</hi> the benefits of God, of <hi>chearing</hi> the
Heart, and taking the Comforts of the Labours of their Hands,
and a great many more, are ready <hi>excuſes</hi> to ward off the force of
the convincing Word: theſe the Devil drives home, and <hi>faſtens</hi> them
into ſuch <hi>ſtrong perſwaſions,</hi> that the deluded Sinner cannot ſee the
<hi>danger</hi> that is before him, nor the Spiritual <hi>Adultery</hi> or <hi>Idolatry</hi> of
his Soul, in his exceſſive love to Worldly Pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The World hath alſo a Spiritual <hi>Faſcination</hi> and Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
by which (where it hath once prevailed) Men are <hi>inchanted</hi>
to an utter <hi>forgetfulneſs</hi> of themſelves and God, and being drunk
with Pleaſures, they are eaſily engaged to a madneſs and height
of Folly. Some like fooliſh Children, are made to keep a great <hi>ſtir</hi>
in the World for very <hi>trifles,</hi> for a <hi>vain ſhew;</hi> they think themſelves
great, honourable, excellent, and for this make a great <hi>buſtle,</hi>
when the World hath not added <hi>one Cubit to their Stature</hi> of <hi>real</hi>
worth. Others are by this <hi>Circe</hi> transformed into <hi>Savage</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and act the part of <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Tygars.</hi> Others like <hi>Swine</hi>
wallow in the Luſts of uncleanneſs. Others are <hi>unmanned,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off all natural affections, care not who they ride over, ſo they
may rule, or be made Great. Others are taken with <hi>ridiculous
Frenzies,</hi> ſo that a Man that ſtands in the <hi>cool ſhade</hi> of a ſedate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
would judg them out <hi>of their wits.</hi> It would make a Man
admire to read or the Frisks of <hi>Caius Caligula, Xerxes, Alexander</hi>
and many others, who becauſe they were above many Men,
thought themſelves above <hi>humane Nature;</hi> they forgat they were
<hi>born,</hi> and muſt <hi>die,</hi> and did ſuch things as would have made them
(but that their greatneſs over-awed it) a <hi>laughing-Stock</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſcorn to Children. Neither muſt we think that theſe were but
ſome <hi>few</hi> or rare inſtances of worldly <hi>intoxication,</hi> when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
notes it as a general diſtemper of all that bow down to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
this <hi>Idol.</hi> They <hi>live without God in the World,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle;
that is, they ſo carry it as if there were <hi>no</hi> God to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of them, to check them for their madneſs. <hi>God is not in all
his thoughts,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 10. 4, 5. The <hi>Judgments of God</hi> are
far above <hi>out of their Sight,</hi> he puffs at his Enemies, and ſaith in
his Heart, <hi>he ſhall never be moved,</hi> &amp;c. The whole Pſalm deſcribes
the Worldling, as a Man that hath loſt all underſtanding, and
were acting the part of a <hi>Frantick Bedlam;</hi> what then can be a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49412:307"/>
more fit Engine for the Devil to work with, than the Pleaſures of
the World?</p>
                     <p>I ſhall briefly apply this to <hi>two</hi> ſorts of Men,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> thoſe that are <hi>ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
with want and neceſſities, and thoſe whoſe <hi>cups run over,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all <hi>that their Heart can wiſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, To thoſe that think their <hi>meaſure</hi> of outward Comforts
<hi>little,</hi> I would from the Doctrine now explained, tell them
that they have not ſo much cauſe to <hi>vex</hi> and diſquiet themſelves for
their <hi>Poverty,</hi> or <hi>Troubles,</hi> as they apprehend. The World is not ſo
deſireable a thing, as many dream; did but Men conſider how
great a <hi>ſnare</hi> it is, and what <hi>dangers</hi> attend the fullneſs of it, they
would not ſo earneſtly <hi>covet</hi> it, nor ſo paſſionately <hi>lament,</hi> when it
flys from them. If thou haſt ſo much Godlineſs as can <hi>quiet</hi> thy
Heart in a contented enjoyment of thy <hi>little,</hi> that <hi>little</hi> which
thou haſt, is <hi>better than great riches of the wicked:</hi> thou little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
from <hi>what Pride,</hi> Inſolency, Contempt of God and Men, and
many other Temptations and Luſts God doth <hi>preſerve</hi> thee, by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi>
thee Earthly things: thou art now (it may be) often <hi>look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
up to God, <hi>ſtriving</hi> to believe his Word, often <hi>examining</hi> thy
Heart, <hi>labouring</hi> to live upon God, and his Allſufficiency, <hi>looking</hi>
after the Bread that endures to Eternal Life; when if thou hadſt
the Temptations of <hi>Plenty</hi> (it may be feared) thou wouldſt be <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Man,</hi> and be carried away to forget God, to be careleſs of
Holy walking, and ſo make way for Bitterneſs and Sorrow at laſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I would alſo caution Poor Men not to <hi>enlarge</hi>
their deſires too much after the World, but to fear the
Temptations of the World; it is not only a <hi>ſnare</hi> to thoſe
that <hi>enjoy</hi> it, but to thoſe that <hi>want</hi> it: for while they admire it,
and engage their Affections for it, it enſnares them in <hi>ſinful under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,</hi>
they are tempted to <hi>Lye, Cheat, Diſſemble,</hi> to <hi>uſe unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Shifts,</hi> to <hi>Rob, Steal, over-reach in Bargaining,</hi> and to <hi>neglect</hi>
the care of the Soul in all. Let ſuch call to mind (1.) that often
the Providence of God doth of purpoſe <hi>thwart</hi> and croſs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of ſuch, ſo that though they toyland ſweat, running from
Market to Market, <hi>riſing early, and ſitting up late,</hi> yet he <hi>blowes</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their gettings, and they wither to nothing, <hi>while it is yet in
their hand;</hi> or if they ſeem to keep them longer, yet all the end
they make with them, is but to put them into a <hi>bag with holes,
they periſh by evil travel, Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 14. (2.) They often are at a
great deal of labour in purſuit, and then when the deſired object
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49412:308"/>
is <hi>within their reach,</hi> they are overwhelmed with their <hi>diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
as if Providence deſigned to <hi>mock</hi> them for their Folly. This
is excellently ſet forth, in the <hi>Emblem</hi> of a Man <hi>climbing</hi> up a Rock,
with great labour to reach a <hi>Crown</hi> that hung upon the <hi>Precipice,</hi>
who when he had ſtretched himſelf to <hi>graſp</hi> it, falls down and
<hi>breaks his Neck.</hi> (3.) And when they do by great toyl <hi>rake</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an <hi>heap</hi> of Riches, they are <hi>ſtarved</hi> frequently in their Plenty,
and ſo curſed that they have no more <hi>than the beholding of their
Goods with their Eyes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 11.</note> in that God denies them a <hi>Heart to uſe them.</hi>
(4.) Their gettings allay not their Thirſt for more, <hi>He that loveth
Silver, ſhall not be ſatisfyed with Silver,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 10. (5.) Often
they are given as a <hi>ſcourge</hi> and Plague; as the <hi>Quales</hi> given to the
<hi>Iſraelites, came out of their Noſtrils.</hi> The wiſe Man notes it, Eccleſ.
5. 13. <hi>Riches are kept for the Owners thereof to their hurt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, To thoſe that <hi>have the delights</hi> of the World, plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Eſtates, full Tables, beautiful Houſes, rich Tradings, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and Dignities: I would deſire to give the greateſt caution,
that they take heed to themſelves, becauſe they <hi>walk in the midſt of
Snares.</hi> Theſe ſhould conſider (1.) that the great God hath laid
moſt ſerious charges upon them, <hi>not to love the World,</hi> but to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
their Affections from it, nay to be <hi>Crucified</hi> to it, as to any
captivating delight, and to <hi>uſe</hi> it with ſuch an <hi>Indifferency</hi> of mind,
that they ſhould be in their deportments towards it, as <hi>if they uſed
it not.</hi> (2.) They ſhould have their danger <hi>in their Eye.</hi> How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is he of his ſteps, that knows he walks in the midſt of <hi>Serpents</hi>
which are ready to ſting him; the thoughts of this ſhould blunt
the edg of our Delights. If you were at a Feaſt where you knew
there were poyſoned Diſhes, you would be affraid to eat any thing.
Do you think that Captain <hi>Smith</hi> when he was taken by the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages</hi>
of <hi>America,</hi> and had plenty of Meat ſet before him (which
he knew was given to fatten him, that he might be better Meat,
when he was killed) had any Stomack to Eat or to Drink?
Was that Feaſt pleaſing to him that fat under a <hi>ſharp Sword</hi> hung
over his Head in a <hi>Horſe Hair,</hi> when he expected every moment
it ſhould fall upon him and kill him? Such are great Men, rich
Men; with what fear and care ſhould they uſe theſe things, when
they know there is hazard of miſchief from them upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion?
How much doth Chriſt ſpeak in that one Sentence, it is
<hi>eaſier for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle, than for a rich Man
to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> He means not that 'tis <hi>abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49412:308"/>
impoſſible,</hi> but <hi>extreamly difficult,</hi> and the difficulty lies in the
hinderances which their Riches caſts before them. (3.) They
ſhould carefully conſider, for what <hi>ends</hi> God gives theſe, and to
what <hi>uſe</hi> they are to be put. Rich Men are but God's <hi>Purſers,</hi> they
do but <hi>carry the Bag,</hi> and what is put therein, for <hi>publick uſes;</hi> if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
as faithful Stewards, they lay it out upon thoſe that
have need, they ſhall <hi>make Friends of the unrighteous Mammon,</hi> and it
will turn to a Spiritual Account: but if they think that all is for
themſelves, and ſo ſhut their Bowels, and Purſes from others, then
they carry the <hi>Bag</hi> no otherwiſe, than as <hi>Judas</hi> did, and will be
eaſily perſwaded to <hi>ſell</hi> Chriſt and Heaven for a <hi>little more</hi> of

                     <head>CHAP. XXII. Of Chriſt's Anſwer in the general. That theſe Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were upon deſign for our Inſtruction. Of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
betwixt Epheſ. 6. and Matth. 4. The firſt Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Of couragious Reſolves in reſiſting Temptations.
Its conſiſtency with ſome kind of fear. The neceſſity of
this Courage. Wherein it conſiſts; and that there is a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in mourning Spirits.</head>
                     <p>THeſe Anſwers of Chriſt to the ſeveral Temptations (which
are now to be explained) are <hi>different</hi> as to their <hi>matter,</hi> yet
the <hi>general Purport</hi> of them being the ſame, I ſhall therefore handle
them together. They may be conſidered two ways.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, As they are fit and pertinent anſwers to particular Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
of <hi>Diſtruſt,</hi> of <hi>Preſumption,</hi> of <hi>Debauching</hi> the Heart by
<hi>Worldly Delights</hi> to the Service of Satan; and thus may they be
uſeful in their conſideration, to thoſe who are directly moved by
Satan to ſuch Sins. And when at any time we are tempted in
ſtraits; to <hi>caſt away our reliance</hi> upon the careful Providence of God,
we may look upon Chriſt's Anſwer, that <hi>Man's Life</hi> doth not ſo
depend upon the <hi>uſual means,</hi> but that any other thing bleſſed by
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49412:309"/>
Divine Appointment may be uſeful to that end. When we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
to <hi>preſume of extraordinary</hi> ſupports; then by Chriſt's Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the Temptation may be reſiſted by conſidering, that howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
God be to be truſted, yet he is at no time to be <hi>tempted by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
expectations</hi> in the <hi>neglect</hi> of the ordinary means. If our
Hearts be wooed <hi>by Worldly Delights</hi> to <hi>caſt off our care of God</hi> and
Religion; we may then call to mind, that this is <hi>abominable
Idolatry,</hi> and ſo may we turn off our Hearts from ſinful compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
by charging our Souls with the oppoſite Duties, upon a
true diſcovery of the vileneſs and inconvenience of the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
urged upon us.</p>
                     <p>But Secondly, They may be conſidered as they give <hi>Inſtruction</hi>
for the management of our <hi>Spiritual Armour</hi> againſt all Satan's
Wiles in the <hi>general,</hi> and in this Senſe I ſhall endeavour to open
them, laying down firſt theſe two Concluſions:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the <hi>whole buſineſs</hi> of theſe Temptations, as permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Satan, and ſubmitted unto by Chriſt, was certainly upon
<hi>deſign.</hi> The ſame Wiſdom that contrived the wonderful method
of the Salvation of Men by a Redeemer, did alſo order theſe
Temptations; for elſe Chriſt could have <hi>prevented</hi> them, or by a
Divine Authority commanded <hi>Silence</hi> to the Tempter, and by his
Power might have chaſed him away. As Chriſt told <hi>Pilate, Thou
couldſt have no power at all againſt me except it were given thee from
above;</hi> thereby manifeſting that his Suffering was from an higher
deſign than he was aware of: ſo might he have ſaid to the Devil,
<hi>Except this had been deſigned by an Eternal Counſel, thou couldſt not
have made this attempt.</hi> So that we muſt look further for the <hi>ſpring</hi>
and riſe of this, than to any ſuppoſed <hi>occaſional outbreaking</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical
malice upon him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That this deſign, however it touched upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Offices of Chriſt, as Mediator and ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> (for
thus it became him to overcome the Enemy at the ſame Weapon,
by which he overcame our firſt Parents, and by this Perſonal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<note place="margin">Si ad Impe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ejus lapides poſſent fieri panes, ergo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra tentas, ſi autem non fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra, Filium Dei ſuſpicatis.</note> to be fitted with feeling compaſſions to the tempted) yet
was it wholly <hi>for our ſakes,</hi> as may appear by <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In that Chriſt (if his anſwers had only concerned himſelf)
might have given <hi>other fit replies,</hi> to the <hi>firſt</hi> Temptation, <hi>of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Stones to Bread:</hi> he could have retorted the Argument upon
Satan, (as <hi>Hierom</hi> and others obſerve) <hi>If I am not the Son of God.
'tis in vain to require a Miracle of me; If I am, 'tis in vain to tempt me,</hi>
                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:49412:309"/>
Or he might have anſwered, <hi>That as the Father hath Life in himſelf,
ſo hath he given to the Son to have Life in himſelf,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Muſculus</hi> in loc.</note> 
                        <hi>and that by this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power he could ſuſtain himſelf without Bread.</hi> To the <hi>ſecond,</hi> it
might have been a ſufficient anſwer, to have <hi>excepted</hi> againſt his
<hi>unfaithfulneſs</hi> in citing that Teſtimony out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. where, by
diſcovering his <hi>wilful omiſſion</hi> of the Clauſe, <hi>[in all thy ways,] He
ſhall keep thee in all thy ways,</hi> his Temptation might have fallen to
the Ground, as no way encouraged from that Promiſe. To the
<hi>third</hi> might have been returned ſuch anſwers as theſe, that <hi>Satan's
offer was a Lye, that it was not in his Power to diſpoſe of the Kingdoms
of the World: That theſe were Chriſt's already, that theſe were vain
Arguments to draw him from the Glory of an Heavenly Kingdom;</hi> and
finally, <hi>that of all Creatures Satan</hi> (being God's ſworn Enemy) <hi>had
leaſt reaſon to expect Divine Honour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, In that all Chriſt's Anſwers were from <hi>Scripture</hi>
(which is properly, a <hi>Light to the ſteps of Men)</hi> and all theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
cited, ſhew <hi>Mans Duty;</hi> he ſaith not, <hi>the Son of God ſhall not
live by Bread alone,</hi> but <hi>Man lives not by Bread alone;</hi> he ſaith not,
<hi>Chriſt muſt not tempt, but thou (Man) ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy
God,</hi> &amp;c. By all which we may diſcern, that Chriſt anſwered, not
by Arguments <hi>peculiarly agreeable</hi> to his <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> but by
ſuch as ſuit the <hi>general ſtate of God's Children.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vide arma quibus tibi non ſibi vicit. <hi>Ambr.</hi>
                        </note> And this certainly
was for our advantage, he conquered with ſuch Weapons; not for
any <hi>neceſſity</hi> that he had to take that courſe, but for the <hi>need that we
had of ſuch inſtruction;</hi> for hereby we ſee, that Satan is <hi>conquerable,</hi>
and alſo <hi>how</hi> we muſt uſe our Weapons.<note place="margin">Haec armatura non tam Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto Filio Dei quam nobis il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Tyrunculis convenit, uti tamen ille vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit, ut nos ſuo doceret exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo, perinde atque ſi fortis quidam Gygas gas hoſtem non ſuis, ſui armis fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </note> In this alſo he left us <hi>an
Example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps:</hi> as <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<hi>as you ſee me do, ſo do you likewiſe,</hi> Thus as it were doth our
Lord ſpeak to us, <hi>for your ſakes ſuffered I theſe Temptations, that I
might teach your Hands to war, and your Fingers to fight; for your ſakes
I uſed theſe Weapons of yours, rather than my own, that I might ſhew
you the uſe of your Sword and Shield, and how your Adverſary may be
overcome by them:</hi> dealing herein with us, as a <hi>Maſter</hi> at Arms, ('tis
<hi>Maſculus's</hi> Compariſon) who for the better inſtructing and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
of his <hi>Tyro,</hi> takes rather his <hi>Diſciples Sword,</hi> than his <hi>own,</hi>
to beat his Adverſary withal; minding not only the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> of an
Enemy, but alſo the <hi>encouragement</hi> of a young Souldier.</p>
                     <p>If any carry a ſuſpition in their Mind, that Chriſt had not our
inſtruction ſo much in his Eye as hath been ſaid, becauſe he gives
not ſuch <hi>particular Inſtructions</hi> for our ſpiritual Welfare, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49412:310"/>
in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. expecting, that our Saviour ſhould have been
more <hi>punctual</hi> in making particular <hi>Applications</hi> from every part of
his carriage to our uſe, and drawing out from thence ſome <hi>poſitive
concluſions</hi> or draughts of the way and <hi>manner</hi> of reſiſtance; they
may know, that there is no other difference betwixt <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. and
<hi>Matth.</hi> 4. than there is betwixt <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Example.</hi> What the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
there preſcribed in the Theory, here Chriſt teacheth in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
here we have in their <hi>uſe,</hi> the <hi>Girdle of Truth,</hi> the <hi>Shield of Faith,</hi>
the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Helmet of Salvation,</hi> and all the other parts
of that Armour; and withal we may know, that this is a far more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
way of teaching young Beginners, to let them ſee things
in a plain Example, than only to give general Precepts. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
we are to conſider that Chriſt did many things, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof the Diſciples then preſent with him, did not know
as yet, neither was it expected from them that they ſhould (like
to what he ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 13. 7. <hi>What I do, thou knoweſt not
now, but thou ſhalt know hereafter)</hi> but were intended to be laid up
<hi>in ſtore</hi> to be more fully made uſe of, as <hi>after-directions</hi> ſhould come
in to give them information. He therefore that had purpoſed to
give further light in this matter by his Apoſtle and Servant, was
now doing that which his deſign led him to in his Perſonal Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
with a <hi>ſecret reſpect</hi> alſo to thoſe Inſtructions which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>after</hi> to <hi>communicate.</hi> We have then no reaſon to be jealous
that theſe Temptations were not intended for our uſe, but the
more to aſſure our ſelves that it was even ſo, becauſe we find that
thoſe very <hi>Weapons</hi> which here Chriſt in his own Perſon <hi>weilded</hi>
againſt Satan, are afterwards <hi>recommended</hi> to us.</p>
                     <p>Having thus laid the Foundation, we muſt then (if we will
Imitate our Captain) carefully obſerve his <hi>deportment</hi> from point
to point, that we may draw out thoſe Inſtructions which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for us.</p>
                     <p>And the firſt thing that I ſhall take notice of, ſhall be the <hi>Courage</hi>
and Magnanimity of our Leader; he had endured Temptations
<hi>forty days and nights before,</hi> and yet he keeps the Field without any
appearance of <hi>ſhrinking</hi> or running away; Satan no ſooner tempts,
than he is repelled. From this Conſideration we have this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</p>
                     <p>That he that would ſuccesfully reſiſt Temptations,<note place="margin">Direct. 1.</note> muſt not fly, but
with a couragious reſolve ſet himſelf to oppoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="185" facs="tcp:49412:310"/>
Chriſtians are apt to <hi>fear,</hi> when Satan comes up againſt them,
and ready to <hi>turn</hi> their Backs: As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were diſmayed at
the appearance of <hi>Goliah,</hi> and fled before him. But if we would
conquer, we muſt (as <hi>David)</hi> go out againſt him in <hi>the name of the
Lord:</hi> to this we are called, 1 Cor. 16. 13. <hi>Stand faſt in the Faith,
quit your ſelves like Men, be ſtrong:</hi> and Epheſ. 6. 14. <hi>Stand, having
your Loins girt with Truth,</hi> &amp;c. This Courage recommended is not
a <hi>Contempt</hi> and negligent ſlighting of Danger, nor is it a <hi>bold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturouſneſs</hi>
upon occaſions of Sin; it is an <hi>Holy, humble Courage,</hi>
and doth admit of a <hi>threefold</hi> fear.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Of a <hi>fear of Sin,</hi> that is, a <hi>hatred</hi> of it. We muſt fear
Sin as the greateſt evil: this is no <hi>Cowardice,</hi> but tends to the
<hi>ſtrongeſt reſolution,</hi> and higheſt endeavours againſt it. From this
Principle is it, that Men oppoſe Sin as their <hi>Mortal Enemy,</hi> and
excite their utmoſt Courage to fight againſt it. As the <hi>Philiſtines</hi>
being affraid of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and yet hating to ſerve the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
encouraged one another, <hi>Be ſtrong, and quit your ſelves like
Men, O ye Philiſtines.</hi> A fear of hatred begets boldneſs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Courage admits of a <hi>preventing</hi> fear, and a provident
avoidance. <hi>Occaſions</hi> of Sin are to be fled, we are not with greater
earneſtneſs called upon to ſtand, than we are warned in this caſe,
<hi>to fly.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 18. &amp; 10. 14.</note> So the Apoſtle often, <hi>fly Fornication, fly Idolatry, fly youthful
Luſts. Occaſions are beſt oppoſed by flying,</hi> where <hi>Calling,</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi>
doth not <hi>engage.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 22.</note> Prov. 4. 14. <hi>Enter not into the Path of the Wicked,
and go not in the way of evil Men.</hi> He fights beſt, that flies moſt,
where neceſſity doth not bid him ſtay.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It alſo admits of the fear of an Holy <hi>Jealouſy;</hi> ſuch a
<hi>Diſtruſt</hi> of our ſelves, as puts us to ſeek to the <hi>Rock which is higher
than we,</hi> for ſhelter. God calls us <hi>to turn into our ſtrong hold,</hi> and to
<hi>lay hold upon his Strength.</hi> 'Tis raſhneſs or deſperateneſs, and not
true Courage, to adventure our ſelves without our Guard or Shield.
But however we muſt <hi>fear</hi> Sin, <hi>ſuſpect</hi> our Strength, and fly <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;</hi>
yet <hi>Satan</hi> we muſt not fly. Here we are bid to ſtand, for
theſe Reaſons,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, 'Tis Impoſſible to fly <hi>from him.</hi> He can follow us where
ere we go: if we go to <hi>Holy Aſſemblies,</hi> he can come thither: If we
ſhut up our ſelves in our <hi>Cloſets,</hi> he can meet us there: If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
our ſelves to a <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> or to a <hi>Croud,</hi> to be ſure he will find
us out.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="tcp:49412:311"/>
Secondly, We are expreſly charged to <hi>make reſiſtance.</hi> Jam. 4. 7.
<hi>Reſiſt the Devil.</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 9.—<hi>whom reſiſt.</hi> This plainly ſpeaks poſitive
endeavours and oppoſition on our part.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A <hi>fainting</hi> fear is an unbelieving <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> of God's
Power, as if he were not <hi>able to ſave to the utermoſt,</hi> and of Chriſt's
compaſſionate tenderneſs, as if he would not <hi>ſuccour thoſe that are
tempted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Our fainting makes Satan <hi>inſult.</hi> He triumphs when
we turn our Backs, and beſides hath the greater advantage to
wound us or to tread us down at Pleaſure. 'Tis obſerved, that God
provides Armour for <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Breaſt,</hi> and all the <hi>fore-parts,</hi> by a
Sheild in caſe of Reſiſtance: but if we fly (ſo little encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is there for cowardice) there is no <hi>Armour</hi> for the <hi>Back.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, 'Tis moſt ſuitable to Chriſtian Courage to <hi>dye in the
place,</hi> and to put it to the utmoſt hazard rather than to yeild. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Veſpaſians</hi> Motto, <hi>Oportet Imperatorem ſtantem mori.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Chriſtian ſhould ſay, <hi>ſhall ſuch an one as I fly?</hi> One that hath
given up my name to God; one that hath profeſſed Holineſs afore
Men; one that hath ſo many advantages for reſiſtance, and ſuch
ſweet encouragements from a Victorious General.</p>
                     <p>But the great Queſtion is,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> What is this <hi>fear</hi> that is <hi>forbidden,</hi> and
the <hi>Courage</hi> which is <hi>enjoined?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> The fear forbidden is an unbelieving <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>puſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity,</hi>
through which, as hopeleſs of ſucceſs, Men <hi>throw down
their Weapons,</hi> and yeild themſelves up to Satan, when the Hearts
of Men fail them to the giving up of the Victory.</p>
                     <p>Spiritual Courage (on the contrary) is a <hi>ſerious reſolve of fighting
it out in the Strength of the Lord,</hi> and it conſiſts of theſe <hi>two</hi>
parts.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, A Sincere Reſolution to be on <hi>Chriſt's ſide</hi> againſt all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
a deliberate unfeigned determination to ſtand for God and
his Holy ways, againſt Satan and Sin. (1.) The ground of this
determination, is a <hi>conviction</hi> of the <hi>evil of Sin,</hi> even to an <hi>hatred</hi>
of it. He that hath not throughly weighed the Miſery of living in
Sin, and fully purpoſed within himſelf to forſake it, can have no
true Chriſtian Courage when it comes to a pinch. (2.) From this
ground, he lays himſelf under <hi>ſolemn engagements</hi> to Chriſt his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
(as Souldiers liſt themſelves under their Captains) that he
will <hi>follow him</hi> and obſerve his Commands; he gives up himſelf to
God by Covenant: So that now he is no longer <hi>his own,</hi> but
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49412:311"/>
Chriſt's Servant, bound for his work. (3.) And this with ſuch
or ſo much <hi>belief</hi> of his Promiſes for Aid and Victory, that he hath
ſome <hi>Hopes</hi> or Expectations at leaſt, that God may at laſt ſo aſſiſt
him, that he may attain to ſome <hi>real degree</hi> of the Mortification of
the <hi>Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The ſecond part of this Courage conſiſts in a <hi>ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
management</hi> of this undertaking. Courage is not only ſeen in
the <hi>firſt onſet,</hi> but in the <hi>Proſecution</hi> of the Warfare: and this lies
in <hi>two</hi> things. (1.) When there are <hi>real indeavours</hi> againſt Sin
(anſwerable to this undertaking) in all ways of ſtriving to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it: when Men do not engage againſt Sin with <hi>big words</hi> only;
or as the Children of <hi>Ephraim</hi> (who arming themſelves and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bows, ſeemed to have ſtout reſolves, but then <hi>turned back in
the day of Battel,)</hi> but with real and <hi>conſciencious wreſtlings,</hi> ſetting
themſelves with all their might and care againſt every Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſtudying to <hi>purſue</hi> the Victory (where in any degree 'tis
obtained) to a greater height. (2.) When theſe endeavours are
ſincerely <hi>perſiſted</hi> in, without being <hi>quite wearied out</hi> or utter faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſo that it never comes to this (though they may be ſometime
under Satan's feet) that they <hi>relinguiſh</hi> their <hi>firſt ſolemn Engagement,</hi>
or repent of their undertaking, and then turn their backs upon
God, <hi>liſting</hi> themſelves under Satan's Colours; ſuch a fainting as
this would bereave Men of their Crown: <hi>Ye ſhall reap in due time
if ye faint not,</hi> Gal. 6. 9. Upon this hazard are the Children of God
cautioned, Heb. 12. 3. <hi>leſt ye be wearied, and faint in your mind.</hi>
(3.) There is alſo a particular kind of courage expreſſed in an
<hi>holy and humble contempt</hi> of Satan's Suggeſtions,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Capel</hi> Tempt. Part 2. c. 9. <hi>Ames</hi> Caſ. Conſc. <hi>lib. 2. c.</hi> 18 §. 14.</note> when after all
means uſed, they <hi>ceaſe not</hi> to be troubleſome: this is not to ſlight
<hi>Sin,</hi> but to ſlight <hi>Satan,</hi> who though he is reſiſted, ceaſeth not to
moleſt.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall particularly apply this firſt Direction (1.) to thoſe that
propound <hi>Eaſe</hi> to themſelves in their Race,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> or Warfare (which is a
thing impoſſible to one that doth the work of a <hi>Souldier,</hi>) not
conſidering, that work and couragious endeavours do abide them.
(2.) To thoſe that pretend themſelves Chriſt's <hi>Souldiers,</hi> Courage
and Chriſtian Magnanimity is your <hi>cognizance;</hi> by this muſt you be
known. How do ye <hi>ſtand?</hi> what are your <hi>reſolutions,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings?
Thoſe Chriſtians that have <hi>Joy and Peace in believing,</hi> can
more eaſily ſatisfy themſelves in this, but thoſe that fight in
<hi>Tears and Grief,</hi> in diſquiets and troubled Thoughts, are apt to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49412:312"/>
conclude themſelves <hi>unbelieving,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>fearful;</hi> or to
think, that they look not up to Jeſus, the <hi>Author and finiſher of
their Faith,</hi> becauſe they <hi>apprehend</hi> themſelves weary and <hi>faint in
their Minds.</hi> For the eaſe and help of ſuch, I ſhall ſhew in a few
things, that there is as <hi>real</hi> a Chriſtian Courage in ſuch <hi>Mourners,</hi>
as in ſome that ſing <hi>Songs</hi> of Triumph.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, 'Tis a <hi>real</hi> courage and undertaking againſt Sin, for any to
reſolve his <hi>utmoſt,</hi> out of <hi>deteſtation</hi> of it, before he can <hi>ſatisfy</hi>
himſelf that God will accept of it. To oppoſe Sin under ſuch a
diſcouragement, or at ſuch a venture, is a <hi>couragious hatred;</hi> and
yet ſo do theſe Mourners.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To be under <hi>continual grievings</hi> becauſe of <hi>miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
ſo that other things of <hi>outward enjoyment</hi> ceaſe to be <hi>pleaſing,</hi>
is a couragious hatred; but this is their caſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To <hi>wreſtle</hi> againſt Sin under <hi>high diſcouragements,</hi> when
afflicted and toſſed, when Satan runs upon them, and ſhakes them
by the Neck, and yet they <hi>continue</hi> their wreſtling and withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as they are able. This is faithful reſiſtance, <hi>a reſiſtance unto
Blood, ſtriving againſt Sin,</hi> Heb. 12. 4. that is (if that expreſſion
be proverbial, like that, <hi>ad Sanguinem uſque)</hi> they reſiſt Sin faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
under great <hi>Hazards</hi> and <hi>Inconveniencies,</hi> even to Wounds
and Blood, till they have <hi>broken</hi> Heads and <hi>broken</hi> Faces; and can
ſay to God, though we have been <hi>broken in the place of Dragons,</hi> and
have theſe Wounds to ſhew, yet <hi>have we not departed from thee,</hi> nor
quitted our deſires after thee and Holineſs, for all theſe buffetings
of Satan: but this is the Character of theſe dejected ones.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, 'Tis a couragious hatred that cannot ſuffer a ſinful
<hi>Motion</hi> to fall upon the Soul, but it puts all into a <hi>combuſtion</hi> within,
and raiſeth diſquiet, for it is an Argument that there is a <hi>contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi>
betwixt the Heart and Sin: but this is their caſe alſo.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, 'Tis Courage and Conſtancy to <hi>bold on</hi> in gracious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
and ſtrivings; ſo that when they fall, as ſoon as they can
<hi>recollect</hi> their Strength, they <hi>ſet on where they left,</hi> and renew the
Battel, never <hi>changing</hi> their <hi>firſt reſolve</hi> for Holineſs againſt Sin. This
is implyed in the Apoſtles Phraſe of <hi>ſtanding,</hi> Eph. 6. <hi>That ye may
withſtand, and when ye have done all, to ſtand.</hi> He is accounted to
<hi>ſtand,</hi> that <hi>runs</hi> not out of the Field, but ſtands to his Holy Reſolve
to the laſt, though the Battel go ſore againſt him by fits: but ſuch
are theſe Mourners.</p>

                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:49412:312"/>
There is true Courage under Mourning and diſquiet of Heart,
ſo that we may ſay to ſuch, <hi>O thou afflicted and toſſed,</hi> fear not, <hi>The
Glory of the Lord ſhall ſhine upon thee.</hi> They that are weak in this
Sence ſhall be ſtrong as <hi>David.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XXIII. The ſecond Direction, that Temptations are not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.
The ſeveral ways of diſputing a Temptation.
In what Caſes it is convenient and neceſſary to diſpute
with Satan. In what Caſes inconvenient, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of it.</head>
                     <p>THe next thing obſervable in Chriſt's carriage to Satan is this;
That Chriſt (though he rejected every Temptation, by
giving a reaſon of his refuſal from the Command of God) did not
ſuffer Satan to <hi>diſpute</hi> his Temptations further than the <hi>firſt Propoſal,</hi>
and in his Anſwers he takes no <hi>notice</hi> of the <hi>Reaſons</hi> or Motives
by which he laboured to make his Temptations prevailing. In the
two firſt Temptations, he gives no reply, to what Satan inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his ſuppoſition, <hi>[If thou be the Son of God;]</hi> neither by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that he was ſo, nor diſcovering to him his <hi>knowledg</hi> of
the ſecret <hi>Subtilty,</hi> which he had wrapt up under theſe plauſible <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</hi>
In the third he anſwers not a word to the <hi>Vanity</hi> and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of his deceitful offer of the <hi>Kingdoms of the World,</hi> though
(as hath been obſerved) he might have oppoſed ſtrong Reaſons
againſt them all: and beſides, when Satan became Inſolent and
Impudent in tempting Chriſt <hi>to fall down and worſhip him,</hi> he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
him away with a ſevere Abomination, <hi>Get thee hence, Satan.</hi>
From which we have a ſecond Direction, which is this.</p>
                     <p>That Temptations to Sin,<note place="margin">Direct. 2.</note> are to be oppoſed by peremptory denials, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than by diſputings.</p>
                     <p>This is a Note, which moſt <hi>Commentators</hi> have on this place;
but it ſtands in need of a diſtinct Application, becauſe it is not a
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49412:313"/>
Rule ſo <hi>general,</hi> but that the practice of God's Children have made
<hi>exception</hi> againſt it. For the clearer Explanation of it, I ſhall</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Give you the <hi>ſeveral kinds</hi> of diſputings, by which we
may ſee that all are not alike: For</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The ſerious <hi>working</hi> of the thoughts in a <hi>quick denial</hi> of a
Temptation with a <hi>reaſon implyed</hi> or <hi>expreſſed</hi> (though it admit
not Satan to any further diſpute or Argument) may, <hi>in ſome ſenſe,</hi>
be called a diſputing; for the Scripture uſeth <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> for any
inward ſerious Thought. <hi>Such</hi> a kind of <hi>diſputing</hi> as this is <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;</hi>
it cannot be wanting to any that refuſe a ſinful Motion,
this being (as we ſhall ſee afterward) <hi>one</hi> of thoſe Directions which
Chriſt intended us by his Example, and the very thing which
Chriſt practiſed in every Temptation: for he contented not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to give a <hi>naked</hi> denyal, but ſtill adds a <hi>Reaſon</hi> of ſuch refuſal.
Thoſe who in <hi>general terms</hi> urge that Temptations are not to be
diſputed, do not <hi>reckon</hi> this as any diſputing. And others that
do (taking diſputing for the refuſal of a thing with a reaſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned)
think that his procedure in the two firſt Temptations, is
not <hi>imitable</hi> by us, but only that of the third, wherein he chaſed
away the Devil with angry denyal: but the miſtake is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is a diſputing of <hi>unneceſſary Curioſity</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference:
this is when a ſinful Motion injected into our Hearts, is
not <hi>directly conſented to;</hi> but then inſtead of a <hi>full denyal,</hi> Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to raiſe <hi>Queſtions,</hi> and make <hi>Objections</hi> of <hi>leſſer</hi> moment, or
ſome <hi>impertinent Quaeries</hi> which ſtrike not at the <hi>root:</hi> as one obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of himſelf, that inſtead of <hi>denying</hi> a ſinful Motion, he began
to diſpute, whether it came from <hi>Satan</hi> of his <hi>own inclination,</hi> and
ſo inſtead of <hi>quenching</hi> the Fire, he buſied himſelf to <hi>enquire</hi> whence
it came. Men deal with Temptations in this caſe, as they, who
being asked whether they will buy ſuch a Commodity, <hi>haſtily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
no,</hi> but yet call back the Party again, and <hi>ask</hi> whence it came?
or what it muſt coſt? and by ſuch <hi>intanglements</hi> of <hi>Curioſity</hi> engage
themſelves at laſt to buy it. <hi>Eve</hi> failed by ſuch an <hi>inconſiderate
conference</hi> with Satan, for the <hi>abrupt</hi> beginning of the Serpents
Speech <hi>[Yea, hath good ſaid ye ſhall not eat,</hi> &amp;c.] and the ſumming
up of the Arguments which prevailed with her to eat <hi>[when the
Woman ſaw that the Tree was good for Food, and pleaſant to the
Eyes,</hi> &amp;c.] do clearly evidence that there was <hi>more diſcourſe,</hi> than
is there expreſſed, and that alſo tending to aſcertain the <hi>Goodneſs,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49412:313"/>
Pleaſantneſs,</hi> and <hi>Profit</hi> of the Fruit. This kind of diſputing is
always unlawful and dangerous, for it is but a <hi>wanton dallyance</hi>
with a Temptation, <hi>a playing upon the hole of the Aſp,</hi> and commonly
ends in a ſinful complyance.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is a diſputing of a <hi>deliberating</hi> and <hi>parlying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency;</hi>
this is, when the Devil puts a thought of Sin into their
Minds, and (while they ſeem not to be forward to imbrace it)
leaves it to <hi>further con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ideration,</hi> and then they float, betwixt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved</hi>
and <hi>unreſolved,</hi> betwixt <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> being at a great diſpute
within themſelves what is beſt to be done, whether the <hi>convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
on the one hand, will weigh down the <hi>inconveniencies</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
this in caſes of <hi>apparent</hi> Sin, is a wicked <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>alting betwixt two,</hi>
always unlawful.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There are alſo treacherous <hi>partial arguings,</hi> wherein
the Heart <hi>akes part with Satan.</hi> Theſe are thoſe <hi>debates</hi> that are to
be found in Natural Men, about the <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>not doing</hi> of ſinful
things. This looks ſo like the <hi>Combat betwixt the Fleſh and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
that it hath occaſioned an enquiry, how they may be <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed</hi>
each from other. 'Tis generally concluded that in that
<hi>ſtrife</hi> of the <hi>Natural</hi> Man, the <hi>Light</hi> of the Underſtanding and
Conſcience, gives oppoſition to the bent of the <hi>Affections,</hi> and the
<hi>ſame faculties</hi> (though ſanctifyed in part) in the <hi>Regenerate</hi> are the
Parties that give oppoſition each to other; but with this <hi>principal
difference,</hi> that in <hi>this ſtrife of the Fleſh and Spirit,</hi> the Man <hi>takes part
with God,</hi> whereas in the <hi>other,</hi> the Affections <hi>take the Devils part,</hi>
and in a malignant <hi>averſeneſs</hi> to the Light, ſtrive to put it out, and
to <hi>get over</hi> the conviction of Conſcience, ſo that the Man <hi>ſtrives to
Sin,</hi> and to ſtop the <hi>Mouth</hi> of ſuch objections, as come into the
contrary: this kind of diſputing is always ſinful.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, There is yet a diſputing in a <hi>ſtrict</hi> Senſe, which is a
full and <hi>ſolemn debating</hi> of a Satanical <hi>injection,</hi> by giving it the <hi>full
hearing,</hi> and admitting Satan to be a Reſpondent to our objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Of this it is <hi>queried</hi> how far it may be convenient, and how
far inconvenient, becauſe we ſee Chriſt in this place did not <hi>thus</hi>
diſpute with Satan; and yet we find <hi>inſtances</hi> in Scripture of ſome
Holy Men that have been unavoidably <hi>engaged</hi> to diſpute a
Temptation to the <hi>utmoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To Anſwer this Query, I ſhall Secondly ſhew in what caſes it
may be neceſſary or convenient to <hi>enter the Liſts</hi> with Satan in an
<hi>Holy arguing,</hi> and in what caſes it is <hi>inconvenient</hi> and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49412:314"/>
There are four caſes in which we may diſpute a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When the Motion is of things <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>diſputable,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be lawful or not. Here it cannot be avoided: for albeit
(as the Apoſtle adviſeth <hi>Rom. 14. 1.) doubtful diſputations</hi> are not
to be impoſed upon others, ſo as to tye them up to our perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet in theſe things every Man (before he can act clearly) is
to endeavour his <hi>own ſatisfaction</hi> in the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs
of the thing, that ſo he may <hi>be fully perſwaded in his own Mind,</hi>
ver. 5. And he gives two ſtrong reaſons of this, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23. (1.)
From the <hi>rack</hi> and trouble, which otherwiſe the Man may be put
upon, while his Conſcience unſatisfied, <hi>condemneth him in that,
which</hi> by a contrary practice <hi>he alloweth:</hi> (2.) In that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of Conſcience (while he doth that, the lawfulneſs
whereof he believeth not) is an <hi>evidence</hi> of his <hi>Sin,</hi> as well as an
<hi>occaſion</hi> of his <hi>trouble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Diſputings have place, when a Temptation hath <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
hold</hi> upon the thoughts, and ſo far poſſeſſed it ſelf, that our
<hi>corruption</hi> riſeth up in the <hi>defence</hi> of the Suggeſtion. Satan will not
<hi>quit</hi> that hold (though he be an intruder without our leave,) till
he be <hi>beat</hi> out of his <hi>Quarters.</hi> The Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. implies ſo
much by that expreſſion, of <hi>quenching the fiery Darts</hi> of Satan. It is
not proper to underſtand it of a refuſal of the <hi>firſt</hi> Motion of Sin,
(though Interpreters do uſually make it comprehenſive both of the
<hi>keeping</hi> out of the Dart, and the <hi>plucking</hi> it out) becauſe this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
ſuppoſeth, that the Dart hath <hi>pierced</hi> the Soul, and now
<hi>begins</hi> to <hi>burn</hi> and enflame, which will require more labour for the
quenching of it, than a refuſal of the firſt Motion would put us to.
As when Fire hath taken hold upon our Houſes, we ſhall be forced
to bring Water for the <hi>extinguiſhing</hi> of the Flame, which (before
it had broke out upon the Building) an ordinary care might have
<hi>prevented.</hi> And this we further taught by a diſtinction which the
ſame Apoſtle uſeth in the ſame place of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>ſtanding</hi>
and <hi>withſtanding.</hi> We muſt keep off the Temptation that it <hi>enter
not,</hi> by <hi>ſtanding</hi> againſt the Aſſault in a peremptory <hi>refuſal;</hi> but if
it <hi>do enter,</hi> then we muſt be put to it, by a force of holy arguing
to <hi>pull out</hi> the Arrow, and to <hi>withſtand</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Much more need have we of diſputing, when the
preſent Temptation is a <hi>Motion</hi> of ſuch a Sin which we are <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated</hi>
unto, and have <hi>long practiſed,</hi> for theſe kind of ſinful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49412:314"/>
are not caſt out eaſily. In this caſe, <hi>David</hi> adviſeth his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. (who had for a long time, <hi>loved Vanity, and ſought
after leaſing)</hi> that by <hi>communing with their own Heart,</hi> and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
againſt their ſinful Practices, they ſhould bring themſelves
under an <hi>Holy awe,</hi> and by that means ſtop the courſe of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<hi>ver.</hi> 4. This indeed is the great thing that Sinners are called
to by God, to <hi>ponder</hi> their Eſtate, to <hi>conſider</hi> their ways, to <hi>ſtudy</hi>
the evil and danger of Sin, to <hi>examin</hi> themſelves, and to <hi>reaſon</hi>
together with God about the wickedneſs and ingratitude of their
Actions, and about the contrary lovelineſs, bleſſedneſs and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of the ways of God, that ſo they may be brought to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
all which are done only by a <hi>ſerious arguing</hi> of their caſe and
hazard.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is convenient, and in ſome caſes neceſſary to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
a Temptation which Satan offers to us, <hi>by the Mouths of Men,</hi>
who entice us to ſhare with them in their wickedneſs: for here by
<hi>arguing,</hi> we may not only <hi>diſcourage</hi> their further Sollicitation, and
ſo <hi>free our ſelves</hi> from the like Temptation for the future, but we
alſo by the exerciſe of an Holy Charity, endeavour to <hi>pull them out
of the Fire.</hi> When <hi>Joſephs</hi> Miſtreſs tempted him, he conſidered
that he had to deal both with the <hi>Devil,</hi> and <hi>his Miſtreſs, Gen. 39.
7,</hi> 8. and therefore that he might <hi>reſiſt the Devil,</hi> he peremptorily
<hi>refuſed</hi> the Temptation, but that he might <hi>take off his Miſtreſs</hi>
from her unlawful proſecution, he <hi>argues</hi> with her about the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
Danger and Unlawfulneſs of ſuch an act, <hi>My Maſter
woteth not what is with me in the Houſe, and he hath committed all
that he hath to my Hand: there is none greater in this Houſe than I, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath he kept any thing back from me but thee, becauſe thou art his
Wife: how then can I do this great Wickedneſs and Sin againſt God?</hi>
When Sinners do <hi>entice</hi> us to caſt in our <hi>Lot amongſt them, pitty</hi> to
them, and <hi>care</hi> of our ſelves will engage us to <hi>argue</hi> the folly and
danger of their ways with them, except they behave themſelves
as <hi>Dogs and Swine;</hi> their carriage giving us juſt ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that they are ſo <hi>ſet on Wickedneſs,</hi> that it may <hi>endanger</hi> us,
rather than <hi>profit</hi> them, to debate with them. And ſo was it likely,
(and the Text ſeems to hint ſo much,) that when <hi>Joſeph</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Miſtreſs was <hi>reſolved</hi> upon the purſuit, and that his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were not minded, he <hi>perſiſted</hi> in his <hi>denyal,</hi> but <hi>forbore</hi> his
<hi>arguings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="194" facs="tcp:49412:315"/>
But however it may be convenient to diſpute (in the <hi>laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned</hi>
Senſe) in theſe <hi>four</hi> caſes, (and others may probably be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
yet there are caſes in which it will be <hi>inconvenient</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
to diſpute or argue, and of this order I ſhall reckon
four.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is not ſafe to diſpute the matter, in <hi>vile infectious Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi>
ſuch as are either <hi>ſuitable</hi> to our <hi>Inclinations,</hi> or may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a favourable <hi>aſpect</hi> and countenance from the <hi>poſture</hi> of our
<hi>Affairs</hi> and Condition. Theſe Temptations (even in our deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
againſt them) are like the opening of a <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> which
ſends forth a <hi>poyſonous ſtream</hi> which may <hi>infect</hi> thoſe that <hi>loath</hi> and
reſiſt it. 'Tis dangerous to admit Fire into the ſame <hi>Room</hi> where
there is <hi>Gunpowder,</hi> though there be <hi>no intention</hi> to kindle it. It
hath been an old Obſervation, that the very <hi>confeſſion of infectious
Sins,</hi> (though deſigned to beget ſhame, and reſolution againſt
them for the Future;) have <hi>kindled a new Flame,</hi> by the unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
declaration of the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> ſo that they have
returned from the <hi>Confeſſor more infected</hi> than when they went; and
thoſe very Perſons whoſe care it ſhould have been to have put the
<hi>higheſt diſgrace</hi> upon Sins, ſo <hi>confeſſed,</hi> to the begetting of <hi>loathing,</hi>
and abhorrency in the Parties, and themſelves have by too <hi>curious</hi>
an enquiry received ſuch <hi>Poyſon</hi> at the <hi>Ear,</hi> that the <hi>Heart</hi> hath been
forthwith <hi>infected.</hi> The like Hazard remains to thoſe that are
willing to debate ſuch Sins with Satans; for though they <hi>begin</hi> upon
the ſcore of <hi>reſiſtance,</hi> yet the very <hi>dwelling</hi> on ſuch a ſubject (when
admitted to lay it ſelf open) doth convey ſuch <hi>Amorous looks</hi> unto
the <hi>treacherous Affections,</hi> that the <hi>Heart</hi> is in danger of a <hi>ſecret Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
There is no better way in ſuch caſes than to <hi>command</hi> all ſuch
Thoughts and Confiderations <hi>out of our Coaſts,</hi> and (as we do,
when the City or Town we live in is infected) to withdraw our
ſelves from the air of ſuch a Temptation. We may obſerve the
like care in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> though he thought himſelf concerned at firſt
(as hath been ſaid) to oppoſe the unlawful ſuit of his Miſtreſs, yet
ſeeing her deſperately ſet upon her Folly, he <hi>declined</hi> all <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
with her, and <hi>would not be with her, Gen.</hi> 39. 10. and at laſt
when ſhe caught him by his Garment, <hi>he left it in her hand and fled,
ver.</hi> 12. He might eaſily have <hi>reſcued</hi> his Garment from her, had he
not been aware that his <hi>conteſting</hi> againſt her, might have been an
<hi>occaſion of enſnarement</hi> to himſelf. Chriſt himſelf, when he was
tempted by <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>ſpare himſelf,</hi> (which was a Temptation very
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49412:315"/>
taking to Humane Nature, eſpecially when Suffering, and Death
is in view,) is more ſhort and ſparing in his reaſoning againſt it,
than he was when the Devil tempted him. He gives no poſitive
reaſons againſt it, as he <hi>did</hi> when he was tempted to <hi>fall down and
worſhip the Devil,</hi> but diſchargeth himſelf from any further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the matter by a declared abhorrency of the thing, <hi>Get
thee behind me Satan, for thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God,
but the things which be of Men.</hi> Which is as if he had plainly ſaid, <hi>this
is ſo apparently from the Devil, and ſo much abhorred by me (becauſe ſo
ſuitable to my Condition) that I will not ſo much as diſcourſe of it, or
conſider it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Generally in all Temptations, (though they have not
the advantage of our <hi>preſent, ſpecial eſtate</hi> or <hi>inclination,</hi> as hath
been noted) of an <hi>apparent withdrawment from Obedience,</hi> or of
things <hi>unqueſtionably</hi> ſinful, it is not convenient to diſpute them,
but to diſmiſs them by a <hi>denyal,</hi> except ſome of the <hi>forementioned</hi>
Conſiderations do alter the caſe. In <hi>known</hi> caſes we need not <hi>parly</hi>
but ſtoutly <hi>deny.</hi> Our reſolutions <hi>for Duty,</hi> and <hi>againſt Sin,</hi> ſhould
not be <hi>to ſeek:</hi> we are certain that Sin is to be avoided, and Duty
to be practiſed, here we ſhould be <hi>peremptory. Abraham</hi> being <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
of Duty, when God called him <hi>to a place which be ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
receive for an Inheritance,</hi> he diſputed not the uncertainty, the
danger or inconvenience that poſſibly might attend his removal,
but went out, <hi>not knowing whither he went,</hi> Heb. 11. 8. <hi>Paul</hi> being
called by God to preach among the Heathen, though <hi>Fleſh and
Blood</hi> were ready with Arguments againſt it, yet he would not ſo
much as <hi>confer</hi> with them, but immediately obeyed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16.
Like inſtances I might fetch from other holy Men. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> when the
Preſident gave it to his own choice, whether he would <hi>obey</hi> or <hi>be put
to Death,</hi> commanding him to take it into conſideration, he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
replyed, <hi>In re tam Sanctâ non eſt deliberandum,</hi> that it was not
fit to deliberate in ſo plain a caſe. Mrs. <hi>Ann Askew,</hi> when at the
Stake ready to be burnt, a <hi>Pardon</hi> was offered by the <hi>Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi>
ſhe would not ſo much as <hi>look</hi> on it, but returned this
Anſwer, that ſhe came not thither <hi>to deny her Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
Biſhop Hooker</hi> in the ſame Condition, had a Box laid
before him with a Pardon in it, which when he underſtood,
(he was ſo affraid of <hi>tampering</hi> with a Temptation) he cryed
out, <hi>If ye love my Soul, away with it; if ye love my Soul away
with it.</hi> And many others there were in all ages, ſo far from <hi>accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:49412:316"/>
ſuch <hi>unlawful deliverances,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tentatus a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana cum nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum evadendi modum ſentis, ſimpliciter, claude oculos, &amp; nihil reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, &amp; commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da cauſam Deo. <hi>Luther, tom. 3. f.</hi> 396.

conſideration the unrighteous terms upon which they might have
eſcaped.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When a Temptation, after <hi>all means</hi> uſed, continues
to be <hi>troubleſom,</hi> and is rather an <hi>annoyance</hi> than an <hi>infection,</hi> then
muſt we not <hi>diſpute</hi> it, but by an Holy Contempt <hi>deſpiſe</hi> it.
Temptations to <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> are oft of this nature (as hath been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in its place) and there are other things, by which Satan cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
to God's Children great diſquiet, while they in the mean time
abhor the Sin, and cry out of the Tryal. Here when the <hi>Meſſenger
of Satan</hi> will not <hi>depart,</hi> 'tis an advice that hath the general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of Holy experienced Men, that we ſhould <hi>deſpiſe</hi> the
Temptation, as an approved way to our quiet and eaſe; for while
we think to repel ſuch aſſaults, by <hi>ſtrugling</hi> with Arguments, we
do but <hi>increaſe</hi> the force of them: as he that thinks to <hi>ſhelter</hi> himſelf
againſt the Wind, by holding up his <hi>Cloak before him,</hi> doth but
derive upon himſelf a <hi>ſtronger blaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In Temptations of <hi>inward</hi> trouble and <hi>terror,</hi> it is
not convenient to diſpute the matter with Satan. <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.
42.</hi> 11. ſeems to correct himſelf for his miſtake, his Soul was <hi>caſt
down within him,</hi> and for the cure of that Temptation, he had
prepared himſelf by Arguments for a <hi>Diſpute;</hi> but perceiving
himſelf in a wrong courſe, he calls off his Soul from diſquiet, to
an immediate application to God and the Promiſes, <hi>Truſt ſtill in
God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him;</hi> but in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. 1. he is more <hi>afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand</hi>
with his work, for while his Enemies were acted by Satan
to diſcourage him, he <hi>rejects</hi> the Temptations at <hi>firſt,</hi> before it ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon his thoughts, and chaſeth it away as a thing that he
would not give ear to: <hi>In thee Lord do I put my truſt; how ſay ye
then to my Soul, flee as a Bird to your Mountain?</hi> And there are
weighty <hi>reaſons</hi> that ſhould diſſwade us from entring the liſts with
Satan in Temptations of <hi>inward</hi> trouble, As (1.) the <hi>determination</hi>
of the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of the Soul and its converted ſtate is a Queſtion of
no ſmall <hi>difficulty,</hi> a <hi>knotty</hi> Controverſy, more intricate and abſtruſe
than thoſe Controverſies that in the Schools are of greateſt Name
for difficulty: for this is lyable to more <hi>weighty Objections,</hi> and
ſtands in need of <hi>nicer diſtinction.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Child of Light</hi> cap. 7. p. 41.</note> As Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> Obſerves; <hi>They
that converſe with dejected Spirits, find ſo much quickneſs and nimbleneſs
of reaſoning, turning every way to ward off the force of an Argument
brought for their conſolation, that even wiſe and able Heads are oft put
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49412:316"/>
to a ſtand, and know not what to anſwer.</hi> Would it then be fit to give
Satan this advantage? or to admit him ſo far into our reaſoning?
He that will <hi>invite</hi> Satan to ſuch a conteſt, ſhall be ſure to have his
<hi>hands full.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, This kind of Temptation doth uſually <hi>diſable</hi> Men
for arguing; it oftentimes <hi>confounds</hi> the Brain, <hi>ſtupifies</hi> the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and <hi>weakens</hi> the Memory. <hi>Heman</hi> complains of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as <hi>diſtracted by terrors. Job</hi> calls himſelf <hi>deſperate.</hi> Such Perſons
are not ſurely in a fit caſe to manage a Temptation with ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a Sophiſter as Satan.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If they deſcend into the Battel, he is not only <hi>too ſtrong</hi>
for them, but commonly after a while, they <hi>take Satan's part</hi>
againſt themſelves, and comply with him, concluding againſt their
own peace.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There is alſo a <hi>better</hi> way at hand than to enter into
a Diſpute, and that is, <hi>By going to God by a preſent Faith, Love or
Repentance, when the truth of any of theſe is queſtioned.</hi> It is a difficult
<hi>task</hi> to prove ſome time that <hi>former</hi> acts of Faith, Love or other
Graces were <hi>ſincere;</hi> this may admit of ſuch objections from a
wounded Spirit, that it will be hard to anſwer them; but in this
caſe 'tis a nearer way to ſee if there be not <hi>in all theſe complainings,</hi>
ſome <hi>preſent</hi> acts of theſe Graces: whether ſuch complainants are
not <hi>willing to embrace Chriſt upon any terms, whether they do not have
Sin, whether they would not unfeignedly be reconciled to God,</hi> &amp;c. It
oft falls out that this doth ſtay the trouble, when examinations of
former acts do nothing for them. Some Men are at more pains
(as one ſaith) to repair and fit an <hi>old Building,</hi> then would ſerve
to rear a <hi>new one.</hi> Yet muſt it be <hi>remembred,</hi> that though it were
the <hi>beſt courſe</hi> to reſiſt Temptations of this nature at <hi>firſt,</hi> by <hi>avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
unneceſſary <hi>diſputings,</hi> notwithſtanding when this (as I noted
before of other Temptations) hath <hi>ſeized</hi> upon the heart and taken
poſſeſſion, then ſhall we be forced to fill <hi>our Mouths with Arguments,</hi>
and whether we will or no, muſt we undergo a Conteſt: As we
ſee in <hi>David</hi> who when his troubles had prevailed upon him, was
forced to <hi>plead with God; with himſelf, with the Temptation,</hi> and to
have recourſe to <hi>former Experience; the days of old, and the years of
the right hand of the moſt High,</hi> and all little enough.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, All that I ſhall further ſay concerning the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enceies
of diſputing with Satan, ſhall be to give you the reaſons
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49412:317"/>
manifeſting theſe <hi>unneceſſary Communings</hi> with him to be every way
hazardous and unſuitable. As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, 'Tis an <hi>Honour</hi> to Satan, and a <hi>diſgrace</hi> to our ſelves:
Men are loth to be ſeen conteſting with Perſons of a far <hi>inferiour
rank;</hi> eſpecially in ſuch things which have procured to ſuch, a <hi>noted
Infamy.</hi> 'Tis an uſual peice of Generoſity in Men of Spirit, that
they ſcorn <hi>to ſtrive with a Scold, or contend with a Beggar, or be found
in Company of thoſe that are under an evil name deſervedly:</hi> and in
matters that are vile and baſe, 'tis highly diſgraceful to admit
them to a debate. Such things will either <hi>get</hi> more <hi>credit</hi> than they
deſerve, while they ſeem to be countenanced by a diſpute, or elſe
ſhall <hi>communicate</hi> their <hi>diſcredit</hi> to thoſe that ſhall ſhew ſuch famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
with them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By refuſing to diſpute Temptations, we raiſe up in
our hearts an <hi>active abhorrency</hi> of them, and by that abhorrency we
are <hi>cautioned</hi> and ſtrengthned againſt them: It muſt needs <hi>awaken</hi>
our hatred into a <hi>preſent activity</hi> againſt that Sin, which our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
at <hi>firſt view</hi> preſents to us ſo abominable, that it deſerves
no other <hi>Anſwer,</hi> but to be <hi>whipt out of our ſight.</hi> And when our
Heart is thus alarmed, it cannot but ſtand upon its Guard. 'Tis a
courſe that Holy Men have taken, to keep Men at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from Sin, to preſent it as a thing of <hi>greateſt abhorrency,</hi> and
that is the intendment of that Expreſſion, Rom. 6. 1. <hi>Shall we
Sin, that Grace may abound? God forbid.</hi> The <hi>vileneſs</hi> of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
of Goſpel Grace, he ſhews by ſetting it below the <hi>merit</hi> of any
<hi>ſerious</hi> thought, he ſharpens their apprehenſions againſt it, by an
out-cry of deteſtation. The like he doth <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 3. where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to ſet their Hearts againſt uncleanneſs and covetouſneſs,
by telling them that it was unbecoming Saintſhip, that ſuch things
ſhould be <hi>ſo much as once named by them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Diſputing is a <hi>ſecret invitation</hi> to the Devil to <hi>urge</hi> the
Temptation further: we do but <hi>toy</hi> with him, and give him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to follow us. <hi>Eve</hi> found the truth of this by ſad Experience,
ſhe ſo managed her ſelf, that ſhe plainly intimated ſhe had <hi>a mind
to hear what the Devil could ſay,</hi> for the eating of the forbidden
Fruit; and <hi>ſo</hi> urged the Prohibition of God, and the Threatning,
that ſhe ſought from Satan a <hi>confirmation</hi> of her ſecret <hi>unbelief,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than faithfully indeavoured a <hi>repulſe</hi> of the Temptation; and
mentioned the Threatning under ſuch terms of <hi>uncertainty</hi> and
<hi>peradventure,</hi> as an <hi>Objection,</hi> which ſhe deſired might be <hi>removed,</hi>
                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:49412:317"/>
rather than from a firm belief of that Death ſpoken of, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
her ſelf in her Duty; by all which Satan was ſo
encouraged to proceed, that he preſently confirmed her in her
Diſtruſt.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Theſe diſputings uſually return <hi>nothing of advantage</hi>
to our account, but to Satans. We unneceſſarily enter the Liſts
with him, and that upon very <hi>unequal</hi> terms, he being (as <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid
of <hi>Goliah</hi> and <hi>David</hi> a <hi>Man of War from his Youth,</hi> and we but weak
unskilful <hi>Striplings;</hi> we go out of our Trenches and leave our
Weapons behind us; we expoſe our naked Breaſts to all his Darts,
and by <hi>diſcourſing</hi> with him he <hi>gains</hi> time, wherein the <hi>Poyſon</hi> may
more powerfully <hi>work</hi> upon our Affections. If he was <hi>too hard</hi> for
our <hi>firſt</hi> Parents at this Weapon, we whoſe Hearts are not ſo
faithful to God, as theirs in <hi>Innocency,</hi> but <hi>corrupted</hi> by Satan
(who hath alſo a Party in us) are not likely to come off with
Triumph.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Theſe <hi>preſage</hi> (conſequently) <hi>an overthrow.</hi> A parlying
City holds not long out, it implyes in it ſelf an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to yield, when Armies are willing to Treat. Daily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
and Experience of thoſe that give up themſelves
to Sin after Communication with Satan, ſadly witneſs this
Truth.</p>
                     <p>The Sum of this Direction is this, that when a Motion of Sin
is put into our heart, inſtead of <hi>diſputing</hi> (where it may be avoided)
we ſhould peremptorily <hi>deny</hi> it, and ſend it away with an <hi>angry
rebuke,</hi> or ſevere Abomination, <hi>I may not do it: how can I
do this Wickedneſs? Get thee hence:</hi> or, <hi>The Lord Rebuke thee,
Satan.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XXIV. The third Direction of repelling a Temptation without delay:
the neceſſity of ſo doing. What a ſpeedy denial doth
contain.</head>
                     <p>THe magnanimity of Chriſt, and the peremptorineſs of his
denyal we have noted. We muſt further obſerve the <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diateneſs</hi>
of his Anſwer, he ſuffered not any of theſe Motions to ſtay
long with him, here was not a <hi>Cras tibi reſpondebo, come again to
Morrow and I will Anſwer;</hi> he would not take time with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
but had his Anſwer ready: no ſooner was he tempted, but
the Temptation was repelled; for theſe expreſſions <hi>[but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
and ſaid. Jeſus ſaid unto him. Then ſaith Jeſus unto him]</hi> ſhew
the <hi>quickneſs</hi> and ſpeedineſs of theſe returns, that he anſwered pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
forthwith. Hence we have a <hi>third</hi> Direction in our reſiſting
of Satan, which is this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Temptation are beſt anſwered when they are preſently denyed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. Direct.</note> 
                        <hi>and
forthwith repelled.</hi> The Direction is of great Importance, 'tis not
for us to paſs by a Temptation with <hi>Silence,</hi> or to defer an Anſwer;
For theſe Reaſons:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The nature of Temptations, as <hi>dangerous</hi> or infectious,
doth ſufficiently inforce a neceſſity of their <hi>ſpeedy removal.</hi> Things
of danger require a <hi>ſudden</hi> ſtop. If <hi>Poyſon</hi> be taken into the Body,
we <hi>ſpeedily</hi> labour to caſt it up, or to overcome it by <hi>Antidotes.</hi>
We labour to ſtay the ſpreading of a <hi>Gangreen</hi> preſently. Who
thinks it fit to delay, when Fire hath taken hold upon an Houſe.
The very <hi>opportunity</hi> of help,<note place="margin">—Sero Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina paratur, cum mala per longas conva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere moras.</note> is in the <hi>ſpeedineſs</hi> of the endeavour.
'Tis too late to bring Water when the Houſe is conſumed, too late
to apply a Remedy, when the Diſeaſe hath conquered. They that
conſider what a Temptation is, will ſee no reaſon to move ſlowly
in oppoſing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Silence encourageth</hi> Satan. 'Tis not with him, as 'tis
with Men: 'Tis the Policy of ſome, to <hi>overlook,</hi> their Petitioners,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49412:318"/>
and by ſilence to <hi>ſcare</hi> them from any further addreſs, but Satan
hath more <hi>impudence</hi> than to be put <hi>out of countenance</hi> by delay, and
more <hi>active</hi> Malice, than to be <hi>diſcouraged</hi> by ſilence; nay it doth
on the contrary <hi>imbolden</hi> him. <hi>Modeſt</hi> requeſts are diſheartned by
Silence, but ſuch Motions, which by their <hi>nature imply a diſgrace,</hi>
and carry no <hi>reaſon</hi> for their Acceptance, but what they expect to
find in the <hi>conſent</hi> of thoſe to whom they are made, if they be not
preſently refuſed, they give <hi>encouragement</hi> to hope for <hi>entertainment.</hi>
An immodeſt requeſt to a chaſt Matron, if not forthwith expreſly
abominated, encourageth to further attempts. Sin being ſo
great an affront to an holy Heart, the Motion of it cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
with Silence, but Satan is imboldned to expect conſent
in time, and follows his advantage accordingly. He uſually <hi>flies</hi> at
a <hi>valiant</hi> peremptory reſiſtance; but if the pulſe of the Soul beat
<hi>ſlowly</hi> upon the Motion, he grounds his <hi>hope</hi> upon that, and is
animated to a further procedure.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Our <hi>wills</hi> are apt to be <hi>inclined</hi> by delay. Though grace
have made ſtraight our crooked natures, yet we ſtill carry ſuch a
<hi>ſway</hi> to our former diſpoſitions, that a ſmall thing (having the
advantage of our <hi>natural Bias</hi> and inclination) makes us (like a
<hi>deceitful Bow)</hi> turn <hi>to our old ſtand.</hi> For the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>will</hi>
of the Regenerate are but <hi>imperfectly</hi> good, the faculties that ſhould
obey are <hi>unruly;</hi> in ſuch a caſe how dangerous may delays prove?
Who will ſuffer a ſeditious Incendiary in an Army, formerly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Mutiny? Who will permit Leaven to remain in that Maſs,
which he deſires may not be leavened, and not quickly remove it?
Who will neglect a ſpark upon dry Tinder, (that would not have
it conſumed) and not inſtantly put it out? If it was ſo great a
miſchief to <hi>Eve</hi> in Innocency (as hath been ſaid) to delay her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
denial, of how much greater hazard is it to us? <hi>Delays
are dangerous,</hi> to a very Proverb, and <hi>Silence</hi> may end in <hi>Conſent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Silence is alſo <hi>ſome degree of conſent.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange to find
a Man delaying an anſwer to Temptation, and yet no way guilty
of conſenting. In things that are to be oppoſed with care and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
no Man can withhold his Hand without blame: he that is
not <hi>againſt Satan</hi> (who is to be perpetually reſiſted) is ſo far <hi>for
him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differre juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam eſt negare juſtitiam.</note> as he is <hi>not againſt</hi> him. He that <hi>delays</hi> Juſtice which is due,
<hi>denies</hi> it. The Judge in the Parable was called unjuſt, not becauſe
he had devoured the Widows Houſe,<note place="margin">Qui non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibet cum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, jubet.</note> but becauſe he deferred to
do her right. He that <hi>hinders not</hi> evil when, and as ſoon as he can,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49412:319"/>
doth <hi>command</hi> and approve it. Theſe are received <hi>Axioms</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Men, and have the ſame truth in them, if applyed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of Temptations. And this may further appear by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
(1.) The <hi>weakneſs</hi> of the will in the <hi>Regenerate.</hi> When our wills
are <hi>really</hi> ſet upon good and againſt evil, yet we cannot ſay, they
are <hi>perfectly</hi> for the one, and againſt the other, but that there is
ſtill <hi>ſome degree</hi> of averſneſs to good, and of inclination to evil in
our wills, or elſe we ſhould not meet with complainings of <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
under <hi>ſincere</hi> reſiſtances; as in the Apoſtle, <hi>the evil that I
would not, that do I.</hi> (2.) The <hi>Acts</hi> of the will in conſenting may
be ſo <hi>ſudden,</hi> ſhort, and quick, that they may be almoſt <hi>inſenſible,</hi>
and as forward, and ready as the Motion. (3.) The will may be
<hi>interpretatively</hi> voluntary and conſenting, when yet it forms not in
it ſelf any <hi>poſitive approbation;</hi> it may be <hi>guilty</hi> in that it doth not
<hi>more ſtrongly</hi> and ſpeedily <hi>diſſent:</hi> for the <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> or negation of
the <hi>wills act</hi> (where it ought to act) cannot avoid the charge of
<hi>coming ſhort</hi> of Duty.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Not to anſwer preſently, is to <hi>loſe the beſt opportunity</hi> of
anſwering. 'Tis <hi>leſs dangerous,</hi> more <hi>eaſy,</hi> more <hi>comfortable</hi> to be
<hi>ſpeedy</hi> in denial. The ſooner Fire is put out, or the Diſeaſe is ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

The neceſſity of a quick and ſpeedy rejection of a ſinful Motion
is then beyond diſpute, and there needs no more to be ſaid for the
explanation of this Direction, but an account of what is <hi>implyed</hi>
in a <hi>ſpeedy</hi> denyal; it contains theſe four things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That it muſt <hi>iſſue from a fixed determination</hi> againſt Sin.
Some refuſe a Temptation with the ſame Mind, that carryed <hi>Lot's</hi>
Wife out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and are <hi>forced beyond</hi> their own inclination,
but theſe go not far till they <hi>look back;</hi> and no wonder: for if he
that is <hi>ſincerely peremptory</hi> againſt Sin at the <hi>firſt Motion,</hi> may by
the Sollicitation of the Fleſh be inclined <hi>afterward,</hi> there is little
expectation that he whom the <hi>firſt Motion finds indifferent,</hi> and
but coldly denying, ſhould hold out long. But that <hi>refuſal</hi> that
muſt give any <hi>encouragement</hi> to hopes of ſucceſs, muſt be an Anſwer
of <hi>holy indignation</hi> againſt the offer of Temptation, and that <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
into a ſerious reſolve of heart not to yeild.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This poſitive denyal muſt be alſo <hi>wiſely jealous</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
in Motions that are <hi>unlikely,</hi> or that may ſeem <hi>Light,</hi> little,
and not <hi>directly</hi> intended. Though it may be but a <hi>tranſient</hi> Glance,
or a thing that is out of <hi>our Road,</hi> yet muſt nothing be <hi>contemned</hi> or
undervalued. <hi>Jealouſy</hi> will take notice of <hi>ſmall</hi> actions or <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi>
and no leſs ſuſpitious muſt we be of every proffer made to
us, leſt Satan <hi>by any means</hi> get an advantage againſt us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The refuſal muſt be ſo <hi>quick,</hi> that it may be ready to
take the Temptation by the Throat. At the <hi>firſt Motion</hi> or riſing
of it in our Mind, we muſt endeavour to ſtifle it in the Birth, that
it may be as the <hi>untimely Fruit of a Woman, that never ſees the Sun;</hi>
we muſt not give it time to grow up to a <hi>Rod of Wickedneſs,</hi> but
muſt nip it in the earlieſt buddings of it. 'Tis the nature of Grace
(if we do but faithfully purſue the inclinations of it) to be quick
in its oppoſition; ſo doth the Apoſtles phraſe teach us, <hi>Gal. 5. 17.
The Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh:</hi>
the Spirit is as <hi>ready</hi> to <hi>repel,</hi> as the Fleſh to <hi>ſuggeſt;</hi> no ſooner doth
the one ſtir, but the other is ready with an oppoſition, and the
reaſon of it, is from the <hi>active contrariety</hi> that is betwixt them; for
ſo the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> there uſed, would expreſs it; they are
ſworn Enemies, animated by principles of conſtant oppoſition, as
<hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> are, which cannot meet in peace together, but a
preſent <hi>noiſe</hi> and Combate is raiſed from this <hi>conjunction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When this is done, we muſt endeavour to <hi>maintain,
and ſtick to our firſt diſallowance.</hi> A Child of God (I know) in ſinful
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49412:320"/>
yieldings of infirmity, may ſay as the Apoſtle, <hi>What I do, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
not;</hi> that is (1.) What he then conſents to, he did not <hi>allow</hi>
at the <hi>firſt,</hi> till importunity prevailed. (2.) Though his <hi>Affections
incline</hi> to Sin, yet his conſtant ſettled judgment is againſt it; and
though he do it, he cannot ſay he <hi>approves</hi> it. Neither of theſe are
the things I aim at; but this, that as the <hi>firſt Motions</hi> of Sins are
diſallowed, we ſhould endeavour to <hi>keep</hi> at that, <hi>to ſtand our ground,</hi>
to withhold the leaſt <hi>after-delight</hi> or approbation; not but that we
we muſt be forced, ſadly to acknowledg the real truth of what the
Apoſtle ſpeaks in the place laſt cited, that theſe <hi>different principles</hi>
(which of them ſoever carry the Victory) do ſo <hi>impede</hi> one another,
that when grace carries it, <hi>yet it cannot do the utmoſt it would</hi> or aims
at; ſo that in the <hi>ſtouteſt</hi> oppoſitions, there may be ſome <hi>ſecret</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of allowance unavoidably; notwithſtanding we muſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
our denyal, that if it were poſſible we ſhould not afford the
<hi>ſmalleſt</hi> inclination toward it; the leaſt, the better, and nobler
Conqueſt.</p>

                     <p>THe next particular in Chriſt's Anſwers, to be obſerved by us,
is his <hi>citations</hi> of Scripture,<note place="margin">Ideo Jeſus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes illas Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationes ſolis Sacris Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris vicit, ut doceret nos ſic pugnare &amp; vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. <hi>Cajet.</hi> in loc. <hi>Janſen.</hi> &amp;c.</note> as an invincible Reaſon againſt

that, otherwiſe than for our inſtruction, he lay not under any <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi>
of uſing this <hi>Method,</hi> hath been evidenced before, and 'tis a
thing which all <hi>Commentators</hi> do take notice of. From this we have
another Direction, for the right way and order of reſiſting Tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
which is,</p>
                     <p>That Temptations are beſt repelled by Arguments drawn from the Word
of God.<note place="margin">Direct. 4.</note>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="205" facs="tcp:49412:320"/>
For the explanation of this, it may be conſidered what is (1.)
<hi>preſuppoſed</hi> in this Direction: for when it is affirmed that we muſt
anſwer by Reaſons from Scripture, this Implies,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That Temptations are not to be oppoſed by <hi>groundleſs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſals;
'tis no way ſafe to ſay <hi>we will not, becauſe we will not,</hi> nor
to inſiſt upon our <hi>own</hi> bare reſolve: for this would be <hi>wilfulneſs,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than an <hi>obediential refuſal;</hi> and unwarrantable <hi>ſelf-confidence,</hi>
rather than an humble <hi>wreſtling.</hi> There are ſome, of whom it
may be ſaid, as the Prophet once charged the <hi>Jews, Eſa.</hi> 22. 11.
that when Satan comes up againſt them, they look in that Day <hi>to
the Armour of the Houſe of the Forreſt,</hi> they <hi>repair</hi> the Wall, and <hi>caſt
Ditches</hi> for Fortification; they prepare themſelves to the Battel <hi>in
their own Strength, but they look not unto the Maker thereof,</hi> to <hi>him who</hi>
by his mighty Power <hi>muſt faſhion</hi> our Hearts to reſiſtance. The
Vanity of ſuch undertakings is enough manifeſted in the Event, for
commonly ſuch Men go on in a <hi>Bravado</hi> of reſolution, but are ſo
<hi>altered</hi> at the <hi>firſt</hi> appearance of the Enemy, that they <hi>yeild without
a ſtroak.</hi> Who could be more confident than <hi>Peter,</hi> that he would
not <hi>deny</hi> his Maſter, whatever others did, and yet how ſoon did
his Heart fail him? We may warrantably deny a ſinful Motion,
without being <hi>explicite</hi> in our reaſon againſt it, eſpecially in <hi>uſual</hi>
Temptations and when they <hi>thruſt</hi> themſelves into our Minds, at
ſuch times when our Thoughts are charged with an <hi>attendance</hi>
upon other Duties; in which nevertheleſs the Heart hath a <hi>ſecret</hi> and
implicite regard to the Command of God: But in no caſe muſt
we go down to the Battel, in the ſtrength of a <hi>Wilfulneſs,</hi> leſt it
go againſt us. And thus do they, who when they are reproved for
ſome miſcarriage, as of Drinking, will preſently with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
make <hi>engagements,</hi> not to drink Wine or ſtrong Drink, not
to go into a Tavern or Alchouſe, without any <hi>humble reſpect</hi> to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or the <hi>Power</hi> of God for the Conqueſt of the Sin: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
we ſee that uſually ſuch Promiſes and Obligations do not
hold; either they <hi>wilfully</hi> break them, or they become ſinfully
<hi>witty</hi> to make Evaſions for the practice of Sin, without the breach
of the Oath or Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Direction ſuppoſeth that we muſt deny the Sin
with the Arguments of <hi>greateſt Strength,</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> There were
occaſions and hints of other Anſwers to theſe Temptations that
offered themſelves in Chriſt's way, and yet he waves them all, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only upon Scripture reaſons as the beſt and ſtrongeſt. 'Tis no
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49412:321"/>
Chriſtian <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to urge thoſe inferiour conſiderations, of <hi>Shame,
Loſs, Inconvenience,</hi> &amp;c. Some have no other <hi>reaſon</hi> betwixt them and
Sin, but, <hi>What will Men ſay? Or, what will become of me?</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that theſe would only be a <hi>Train</hi> to bring on diſputings, and
that it is no way ſafe to venture our Souls upon ſuch defences,
when better may be had, (for who will venture his Life upon a <hi>Staff</hi>
when he may have a <hi>Sword?)</hi> 'tis eaſy for Satan to <hi>break</hi> theſe
Bows, and to <hi>cut</hi> theſe Spears in ſunder; he can <hi>ballance</hi> ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
with <hi>equal</hi> reaſons, and preſently make us believe, that we
have <hi>as good reaſon</hi> to <hi>commit</hi> the Sin, as thoſe urged by us, for the
<hi>not committing</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This Direction of uſing Scripture-reaſon doth clearly
imply, that the <hi>force</hi> and Power of Scripture is not in the <hi>Words,</hi> or
Characters, but in the <hi>Mind</hi> and Reaſon of it; that not Scripture
uſed as a <hi>charm</hi> or <hi>ſpell</hi> (as if the Devil were affraid of the ſound,
and words of it) can <hi>beat back</hi> the Devil, but 'tis the <hi>Authority</hi> of
its <hi>Command,</hi> which works upon the Mind the higheſt <hi>Impreſſions</hi>
of <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>care,</hi> and as a ſtrong Argument prevails with us to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear.
Notwithſtanding the plainneſs and undeniableneſs of this
inference, not only do <hi>ignorant Men</hi> bleſs themſelves againſt the
Devil by repeating ſome Phraſes or Sentences of Scripture imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently,
and ſuch as have no direct ſignification of the matter in
hand betwixt Satan and them, (as if the Devil could not endure to
hear the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> or durſt not come within the ſound of the name
<hi>Jehovah)</hi> but alſo <hi>Papiſts,</hi> (and of them, ſuch as might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
more conſiderate than to be carried by, ſuch conceits) have
placed a <hi>vertue</hi> in the <hi>Words</hi> and Sounds of Scripture,<note place="margin">

to the reaſon which they give in the general againſt this
courſe, which is this, that the <hi>Power of Scripture is not in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and Characters, but in the mind and underſtanding of it;</hi> and
therefore profits as <hi>pondered in the Heart,</hi> not as <hi>hung about the Neck:</hi>
and upon as ſlender grounds do they place a more than ordinary
vertue, in the <hi>Angelical Salutation,</hi> in the <hi>ſeven</hi> words upon the
Croſs, in the triumphal Title, <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth, King of the
Jews,</hi> &amp;c. Such kind of oppoſitions are but a mock to Satan, we
cannot think to <hi>bore the Jaw of this Leviathan with a Thorn,</hi> or to
come to him with <hi>this Bridle,</hi> or to <hi>play</hi> with him as <hi>with a Bird:</hi>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:49412:321"/>
he durſt alledg Scripture himſelf to Chriſt, and therefore 'tis not
the phraſe or ſound that affrights him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Direction doth imply an <hi>argumentative, proper</hi>
and <hi>fit</hi> uſe of Scripture <hi>Commands,</hi> or <hi>Promiſes.</hi> We ſee Chriſt ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
not any Scripture <hi>indifferently,</hi> but he uſed fit words, and
<hi>choſe</hi> to himſelf <hi>ſelect ſmooth Stones</hi> out of this Brook to <hi>ſling</hi> againſt
this ſpiritual <hi>Goliah.</hi> Every Temptation had an Anſwer that
doth moſt fully and properly confront it; he regarded the <hi>main</hi> of
the Temptation, and ſuffered not himſelf to be <hi>diverted</hi> from that
proſecution, by engaging himſelf in that which might have been
<hi>perplexed</hi> and controverſial, though he had a fit opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
Satan for a diſhoneſt craft of repreſenting Scripture in a
ſenſe of <hi>his own making,</hi> and ſo might have rejected the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of caſting himſelf down, as leaning upon a <hi>falſe Foundation,</hi>
in that God did not promiſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. to preſerve any that
ſhould preſumptuouſly expect a protection while they run out of
God's ways: yet he waved this Anſwer, and oppoſed the aſſault
by a plain Scripture which chargeth the contrary duty.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Having ſeen what this Direction doth <hi>imply,</hi> in theſe
things that are to be <hi>removed</hi> from the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and intendment of it, I
ſhall next for aſcertaining of the reality and importance of it, ſhew
that Temptations are to be reſiſted by <hi>Scripture Arguments,</hi> by theſe
two Evidences.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, God's recommending of the Commands of Scripture for
<hi>ſuch a purpoſe;</hi> Deut. 6. 6. <hi>Theſe words which I command thee this day,
ſhall be in thine Heart—and thou ſhalt bind them for a ſign upon thine
hand, and they ſhall be as frontlets between thine Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. Whether
the later part of the Command is to be underſtood literally, as the
<hi>Jews</hi> apprehended and practiſed, (though ſome think otherwiſe)
is not neceſſary to be aſſerted, ſeeing 'tis granted by all; that they
were to have the Commands of the Law ſo ready in their Minds,
and Memories, as if they had been written on their Hands, and
upon their Foreheads. That God deſigned this precept for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of Sin and Temptation, cannot be doubted, and that the
advantage which might hence ariſe to them was not only the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
of their Minds, in point of <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> is as una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable;
for that, and more is intended by that part of the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<hi>Theſe words which I command thee, ſhall be in thine Heart,</hi> but
when? beſides this information (which the knowledg of the Law
would afford them) and their humble <hi>complyance</hi> with it, as <hi>juſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49412:322"/>
and good</hi> (which would enable them to ſay, <hi>Thy Law, O Lord, is
within my Heart)</hi> he further enjoyns them, the quick and ready <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances</hi>
of theſe Laws (as if they were <hi>frontlets between their
Eyes, and ſigns on their Hands;)</hi> it can ſignify no leſs than this,
that in ſo doing, they would be able to <hi>reſiſt</hi> thoſe Motions, by
which Satan would ſeek to engage them to the violation of
theſe Commands. Neither need we to doubt hereof, when Chriſt
himſelf hath ſo fully taught us, by his own Example, in reſiſting
Temptations, the <hi>particular uſe of the remembrance of the Law:</hi> In
the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> the Apoſtle is moſt expreſs in this matter, <hi>Eph. 6.
17. Take the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,</hi> where
not only the <hi>uſe</hi> of Scripture-Commands and Promiſes againſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
Suggeſtions is taught, but alſo the <hi>high avail</hi> and potency
of this Weapon in reference to its end: 'tis called a <hi>Sword,</hi> and
in that compariſon, it ſhews the <hi>active</hi> reſiſtance which may be
made by it; and 'tis called, not a Sword of <hi>Fleſh,</hi> (for <hi>the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
of our Warfare are not Carnal)</hi> but <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> to ſhew how
mighty it is in repelling Satan.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Another Evidence of its uſefulneſs, is from the <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi>
which the Children of God have had in the right management
of this Weapon. 'Tis obſervable that while Chriſt anſwered by
Scripture, Satan was <hi>ſilenced,</hi> and had not what to reply to the
Anſwer, but was forced to betake himſelf to a <hi>new Temptation.
David</hi> in many places highly magnifies the Power of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
in the ſucceſs he had by it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 4. He ſhews how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable
it was to preſerve him in his common converſe, from the
ſinful Snares laid before him, <hi>concerning the works of Men, by the
word of thy Lips I have kept me from the Paths of the deſtroyer.</hi> In <hi>Pſal.
18.</hi> 22, 23. he tells us that he was ſhielded from the Sins of his
inclination and love (which are hardeſt to prevent) by the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
that he gave to the Motions of them, in ſetting up the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of God againſt them, <hi>All his Judgments were before me, and I
did not put away his Statutes from me; I was alſo upright before him,
and I kept myſelf from mine Iniquity.</hi> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 11. He puts his
<hi>Probatum eſt</hi> upon the Head of this Receit, and ſpeaks of it as his
conſtant refuge, <hi>Thy Word have I hid in my Heart, that I might not ſin
againſt thee.</hi> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 31. He ſpeaks of it as a <hi>tryed</hi> caſe of <hi>common
experience</hi> to all the Children of God, <hi>The Law of God is in his Heart,
none of his ſteps ſhall ſlide.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In Epiſt. ad Gal.</note> I ſhall add to this, the Experience of
<hi>Luther, When</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Motions of the Fleſh do rage, the only
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49412:322"/>
remedy is, to take the Sword of the Spirit, that is the Word of Salvation,
and to fight againſt them,—of this, I my ſelf have good experience, I
have ſuffered many great paſſions, and vehement, but ſo ſoon as I laid
hold of any place of Scripture, and ſtay'd my ſelf upon it, as upon an
Anchor, ſtraightway my Temptations did vaniſh away, which without
the Word, had been impoſſible for me to endure, though but a little ſpace,

the <hi>Flaming Sword</hi> in the <hi>Cherubims</hi> hand at <hi>Paradiſe)</hi> turns eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way to guard the Soul. I need not give inſtances of its Power
againſt ſinful Motions, having done that already; and of ſuch
Temptations which war againſt the peace of the Soul: I need but
ſay this in the general, that as the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>ſuch</hi> Temptations is
to <hi>diſguiſe God,</hi> and to render him dreadful to us, in the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of Wrath,<note place="margin">Reclamat (Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than) in corde tuo, te non eſſe dignum iſta promiſſione—eſt autem opus ardenti orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, ne extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queatur nobis promiſſio. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Gen.</hi> c. 21. f. 188 Cor dictat De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um adverſum verbum Dei, ſequi debeo non ſenſum meum. <hi>Idem tom. 4. f.</hi> 156.

<hi>Luther</hi> ſets down as a certain rule) So have we in Scripture ſuch

full and <hi>clear</hi> Promiſes to aſſure us of this, and thoſe ſo <hi>adapted</hi> to
every caſe, to every kind of hard thought which we might take
up againſt him, that we may find enough in them to break all
thoſe malicious miſrepreſentations of Satan, and to keep up in our
Mind, <hi>right thoughts of God;</hi> which if we will adhere to (not
ſuffering ſuch Promiſes to be wreſted out of our hands, nor our
Hearts to give way to malignant impreſſions of Cruelty, Revenge
or Unmercifulneſs in God) though we be caſt into <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> into
the <hi>Deeps,</hi> we may find ſome <hi>Bottom</hi> on which to fix ſuch <hi>beginnings</hi>
of Hope, as may at laſt grow up to a <hi>Spirit of rejoicing</hi> in God our
Saviour: and in this caſe, when our Heart and Satan dictate to us
that <hi>God is our Enemy,</hi> we ought (as it were) to <hi>ſhut our</hi> Eyes; to
refuſe to hearken to our own <hi>Senſe</hi> and Feeling, and to <hi>follow the
Word;</hi> but if we once give up the word of Promiſe, 'tis impoſſible

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Remedy is <hi>comprehenſive</hi> of moſt other <hi>Remedies</hi>
againſt Satan's Temptations. In <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. There are ſeveral other
peices of Spiritual Armour recommended, and yet there is ſuch a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49412:323"/>
manifeſt mutual reſpect betwixt this and thoſe, that any may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that however they be <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> in their <hi>Names,</hi> yet they
are <hi>conjoyned</hi> in their <hi>Operation;</hi> the <hi>Girdle</hi> (ſo far as it relates to
truth of Judgment and Opinion) depends on the <hi>word of Scripture</hi>
for Information; the <hi>Shoes</hi> (which are <hi>defenſive reſolves</hi> to walk
with a <hi>ſteedy Foot</hi> in the ways of Religion, notwithſtanding the
hardſhips that attend Holineſs) are prepared to us, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
and peace-bringing <hi>Promiſes of the Goſpel;</hi> the <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
which is our <hi>Breaſt-Plate,</hi> is only <hi>ſet forth,</hi> and <hi>wrought out</hi> to
us by the Scripture, and its Ordinances; <hi>Faith,</hi> which is our
<hi>Shield,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> which is our <hi>Helmet,</hi> they neither of them act
<hi>without the warrant</hi> and encouragement of it: and whereas other
parts of the Armour are <hi>defenſive,</hi> this of the Scripture is compared
to the <hi>Sword,</hi> which not only <hi>defends,</hi> but alſo <hi>offends,</hi> and beats
back the Enemy. If the matter be ſeriouſly conſidered, <hi>all theſe
parts</hi> of Armour are but theſe <hi>two,</hi> the <hi>Graces</hi> of the Spirit, Faith,
Hope, Patience in their <hi>ſincere exerciſe,</hi> and the <hi>word of Scripture</hi> as
the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> by, and in which they ſhew their <hi>Operations;</hi> ſo that all
this Armour being put to <hi>uſe,</hi> in every particular Temptation, it
amounts to no more than this we are ſpeaking of, <hi>viz. That ſinful
Motions are to be rejected, by a believing, ſincerely reſolute oppoſing of
them, with Arguments from the Word of God.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Scripture (as it is the Word and Command of the
great King of Heaven) hath a <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

over the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Men. <hi>Where the Word of a King is, there
is Power, Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 4. and ſuch is the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of a Divine Law, that
it hath Power over the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of thoſe that are yet in their
<hi>Sins,</hi> and can <hi>wound, affright, conſtrain,</hi> and <hi>bind</hi> even the <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi>
ſo that ſo long as they retain any of their Natural Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a Divine Power, they have ſome awe for his Commands,
which may be ſeen and argued (where it would be leaſt expected)
from the <hi>enragement</hi> of the Hearts of Sinners, when <hi>Sin by the
Commandment</hi> (accidentally) <hi>becomes exceeding ſinful.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 13, 14.</note> For as that

charge their Conſciences with it?<note place="margin">Quam ſuave mihi ſubitò fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum eſt carere ſuavitatibus nugarum, &amp; quas amittere metus fuerat, jam demittere gaudium erat. <hi>Aug.

Heart <hi>in love</hi> with it, ſo that it becomes a delightful ſatisfaction to
be preſerved from the Snare.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is no Argument that can be uſed againſt
Temptations, that can be more <hi>afflictively diſcouraging</hi> to Satan:
Satan, as bad as he is, cannot but <hi>believe</hi> thoſe Truths which he
knows, and he knows that there are many Truths in Scripture
which reſpect him, as threatnings of Puniſhment and Divine
Vengeance; he <hi>believes</hi> theſe things and <hi>trembles,</hi> Jam. 2. 19. His
unavoidable <hi>knowledg,</hi> or remembrance of theſe things begets <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
in him, he cannot but be under a dread of theſe Truths;
What can be ſuppoſed ſo to wound him as the bringing theſe things
to memory,<note place="margin">Tract. Sacr. <hi>l. 1. c.</hi> 3. §. 6.</note> by urging the Command of God againſt him? <hi>Dr.
Arrowſmith</hi> gives two inſtances of this kind, the one of <hi>Chriſtopher
Haas</hi> in <hi>Sweedland</hi> (from the Epiſtle Dedicatory to the 5 <hi>tomes</hi> of
<hi>Brentius's</hi> works:) The other of <hi>Daniel Cramer</hi> Rector of a School
at <hi>Stetin</hi> in <hi>Germany:</hi> on both which the Devil made a bold attempt
in a <hi>perſonal Appearance:</hi> from the firſt demanding a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of
his Sins in Writing; from the other demanding a <hi>Paper</hi> in which
one of the Students had obliged himſelf to Satan's Service, they
both referred him to that Text of <hi>Gen. 3. 15. The Seed of the Woman
ſhall bruiſe the Head of the Serpent.</hi> And this was retorted upon him
with ſuch a <hi>ſtrong exerciſe</hi> of Faith, that he preſently <hi>deſiſted</hi> the ſuit
and vaniſhed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This Weapon cannot eaſily be <hi>wreſted</hi> out of our hands.
When we urge a <hi>Divine Prohibition</hi> againſt a Temptation, what
can he ſay in Anſwer? he cannot <hi>deny</hi> it to be the <hi>Word</hi> of God, or
to be <hi>true,</hi> or that we are not <hi>obliged</hi> to it; he made none of theſe
returns to Chriſt, but by his <hi>ſilence, owned</hi> that it was God's Holy
Command <hi>obliging</hi> us to Duty. Neither dares he ſtand upon theſe
<hi>exceptions</hi> to us, except he find our Faith <hi>inclined</hi> to waver, or our
minds <hi>weak</hi> and wounded by inward troubles of Spirit; and when
he puts on a boldneſs to deny Scripture to be the Word of God, or
that it ſignifies God's real intendments in his threatning (for by
begetting <hi>unbelief</hi> of the Truth of Scripture, and by ſuggeſting
<hi>hopes of eſcape</hi> and pardon, notwithſtanding the violation of the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49412:324"/>
Commands of it, the wreſts (when he doth prevail) this Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
out of our hands) yet he is forced to <hi>fetch a compaſs,</hi> and by
many <hi>previous</hi> inſinuations to make his way to theſe <hi>atheiſtical aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions.</hi>
Thus he did with <hi>Eve,</hi> firſt (finding her a <hi>little</hi> inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)
he <hi>dropt</hi> in privily ſomething that might argue, the <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi>
of the threatned Penalty, and then at laſt <hi>poſitively</hi> denyed
it. But now if we hold to this, <hi>that the Command is true and holy,
and juſt and good,</hi> he cannot wreſt our plea from us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Nothing doth more <hi>undermine</hi> Temptations, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
the <hi>reaſons</hi> and motives thereof <hi>vain</hi> and empty, than doth
the contrary commands of Scripture. Temptation hath always
ſome <hi>inticement</hi> of pleaſure or profit, and theſe only ſeem to be <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>
or reaſonable, while we <hi>conſider not</hi> the Word of God, as <hi>rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
wood</hi> or <hi>Fiſh, ſhine</hi> only in the <hi>dark,</hi> but when we are urged
with <hi>ſinful pleaſures,</hi> how <hi>mean,</hi> baſe, dangerous, and unlovely
be they, when the command to the contrary gives information, that
they are <hi>ſnares</hi> and lead to Death, or the provocation of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> While we reſiſt with Scripture-Arguments, we <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
God</hi> (whoſe Command we would ſtand by) to go down to
the Battel with us; we <hi>lay hold upon his ſtrength,</hi> and put obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon him, to take us out of the ſnare, and to deliver us from
him who is <hi>too ſtrong</hi> for us.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It remains that in a word, I ſhew <hi>how</hi> the Commands
or Arguments of Scripture are to be <hi>uſed</hi> in reſiſting Satan, which
is thus: <hi>When you have any ſinful thought caſt into your mind, preſently
reject the offer, by charging your heart with duty, from ſome oppoſite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi>
As if you be urged to acts of Uncleanneſs, preſently refuſe,
thus; No, I muſt not, God hath commanded the contrary, he hath
ſaid <hi>thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi> If a covetous thought ariſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it with this, God hath ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt not Covet.</hi> If you be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to pleaſe the Fleſh, and follow vain delights, anſwer it with
this, <hi>If ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die;</hi> and the like muſt be done
in other Temptations.</p>
                     <p>Some may perhaps think,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that this is <hi>eaſy work</hi> and quickly done,
and that it ſeems to attribute a <hi>Virtue</hi> and Power to the <hi>words</hi> of
Scripture, as if Satan were charmed by the language or phraſe.</p>
                     <p>However,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> At the firſt view this may ſeem eaſy, yet he that ſhall
conſider how much <hi>exerciſe</hi> of Grace goes neceſſarily to the right
uſe of Scripture <hi>oppoſition,</hi> ſhall not ſee cauſe to ſlight it as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49412:324"/>
nor yet to think that any vertue is attributed to the words. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Scripture here is only recommended as a <hi>fit Inſtrument,</hi>
and no further or higher praiſe is given; though therefore we may
not attribute the whole of the Conqueſt to the Inſtrument alone,
yet this hinders not, but that as an Inſtrument <hi>peculiarly fitted</hi> for
theſe ends, we may commend it above all <hi>other Inſtruments:</hi> as we
may juſtly commend <hi>Bread</hi> for nouriſhing above a <hi>Stone,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
more from it, than from a chip; ſo have we reaſon to expect
more by the uſe of Scripture againſt Satan, than from other
means of defence which God hath not ſet up for that Service.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is a <hi>concomitancy</hi> of <hi>Divine Power</hi> and Aid that
<hi>conquers</hi> for us; the Inſtrument is Scripture, but the Power by
which it works is from God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Neither is it any <hi>careleſs formal uſe</hi> of Scripture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
that will give encouragement for expectation of a Divine
concurrence, but the uſe of Scripture in this buſineſs implyes <hi>an
exerciſe of all Graces,</hi> for it is an urging of Scripture under a <hi>fourfold</hi>
Conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, As being <hi>certainly</hi> perſwaded of their <hi>Truth,</hi> and fully
keeping to that belief.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As being <hi>thankfully apprehenſive</hi> of the <hi>holineſs,</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and profitableneſs of the Commands, and <hi>chearfully adhering</hi>
to them, as the only way and means to bring us to Union with
Chriſt, and to preſerve us in it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As being highly and <hi>indiſpenſibly obliged</hi> by them, to
perform the Duty commanded therein, and to avoid the Sins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, All this in an <hi>humble expectation of a divine help</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Promiſe of God. Now he that can plead the Command
or Promiſe againſt a Temptation in this manner, doth not do
an ordinary work, neither will he aſcribe the ſucceſs to the words
and phraſe of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Some may (peradventure) wonder why Chriſt by his example
had not recommended <hi>Prayer,</hi> ſeeing it is of ſuch unqueſtionable
uſe in our undertakings againſt Satan. But that enquiry may be
fully ſatisfied, if it be conſidered, that Chriſt did peculiarly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
himſelf to this encounter by <hi>ſolemn Faſting,</hi> ver. 2. which
doth <hi>include Praying:</hi> for ſuch <hi>complicated</hi> duties are often <hi>denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
by that part which is <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and uſually in Scripture a
<hi>Faſt</hi> is only mentioned, where <hi>Prayer</hi> is chiefly intended. That
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49412:325"/>
this Faſt of Chriſt related to the Temptation, and that alſo as a
means of preſervation, hath been ſpoken of in its place; it remains
only that from hence I add a fifth Direction.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="26" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. XXVI. The fifth Direction of Prayer, and of the ſeriouſneſs required
of thoſe that expect the advantage of Prayer. Of God's
hearing Prayer while the Temptation is continued. Of
ſome that are troubled more, while they pray more.</head>
                     <p>THat in all our endeavours of reſiſtance,<note place="margin">5. Direct.</note> frequent and earneſt Prayers
are not to be neglected.</p>
                     <p>This is ſo frequently recommended, and ſo fully handled by
moſt Authors, that I ſhall refer you to ſuch Authors as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
treat of it; noting only, That the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18.
when he recommends it to us in theſe words, <hi>(praying always with
all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with
all perſeverance, and Supplication for all Saints)</hi> he doth mind us that
he that expects the advantage of that Duty, muſt be <hi>peculiarly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
and ſeriouſly <hi>diligent</hi> in that work. For</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He muſt have a <hi>Praying frame</hi> of Heart, he muſt <hi>Pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,</hi>
or (as the Apoſtle elſewhere) he muſt <hi>Pray continually.</hi> Not
as if this Duty muſt ſwallow up all the reſt, and that a Chriſtian
had <hi>no other Services</hi> to attend than Prayer, but that he muſt be on
a <hi>deſign</hi> to wreſtle with God by Prayer; and this muſt be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carried on, though the <hi>acts</hi> of Prayer be <hi>intermitted;</hi> and beſides,
that (in ſuch caſes) he may keep his uſual <hi>ſtated times</hi> for that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he muſt have his Heart <hi>ſo much</hi> upon his <hi>deſign,</hi> that every <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
or <hi>offer</hi> of Temptation will <hi>preſently</hi> put him upon the Duty;
nay he muſt (in reſpect of the frequent <hi>intercourſe</hi> of his Heart
with God, in frequent <hi>ejaculations</hi> and <hi>breathings</hi> of Soul) be as a
Man <hi>wholly reſolved</hi> into that Duty, as <hi>Paul</hi> was at his firſt Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
who (as that expreſſion <hi>(behold he Prays)</hi> doth intimate) ſeems
to have been <hi>all Prayer,</hi> and wholly taken up with that duty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="215" facs="tcp:49412:325"/>
Secondly, He muſt pray <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> his <hi>Soul</hi> muſt be <hi>truly</hi> in
the Duty. A more than <hi>ordinary</hi> earneſtneſs is neceſſary at <hi>ſolemn</hi>
times, he muſt put out all his Strength, he muſt <hi>cry mightily,</hi> and
with his <hi>whole Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When his Spirit grows dull, he muſt <hi>reinforce</hi> it, watch
his Heart he muſt; and if it be needful to quicken it up, he muſt
add <hi>Faſting</hi> or <hi>Meditation,</hi> or whatever other means may be helpful.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In this courſe he muſt continue without giving off the
Duty, though God behave himſelf as if he minded not his cry, or
took no notice of his hazard, yet without wearineſs muſt our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
follow him. It muſt be continued with <hi>all Perſeverance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The Heart that undertakes this muſt not be ſo <hi>narrow,</hi>
as to be centred upon his own <hi>concern only,</hi> when he is melted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>Spirit of Meekneſs</hi> and Compaſſion for <hi>others,</hi> and is not ſo ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
for Peace or Eaſe, that he could hug himſelf in his <hi>private en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment,</hi>
without <hi>concerning</hi> himſelf to tender and help thoſe that
are in the ſame dangers; when his Supplications are for <hi>all Saints</hi>
as well as for <hi>himſelf,</hi> then may he expect to receive an <hi>Olive branch
of Peace</hi> from Heaven in the return of his Prayer.</p>
                     <p>'Tis often objected by ſuch,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that they <hi>pray,</hi> but are not <hi>heard;</hi>
and that Temptations continue, notwithſtanding many crys and
wreſtlings.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> It is a great <hi>miſtake</hi> to think that Prayers are <hi>not heard,</hi> or
do not prevail, becauſe the Temptation is <hi>not quite removed;</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
may be acceptable to God, and recorded among his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,
where the Temptation, for <hi>Exerciſe</hi> and other <hi>holy Ends,</hi>
may be continued.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, What God hath <hi>promiſed</hi> to ſuch Prayer he fails not
to <hi>make good,</hi> he hath not promiſed to <hi>exempt</hi> us from Temptation,
but from the <hi>Power</hi> and prevalency of it; <hi>If his grace be ſufficient
for us</hi> in the mean time, 'tis an anſwer as good as <hi>Paul</hi> got when
