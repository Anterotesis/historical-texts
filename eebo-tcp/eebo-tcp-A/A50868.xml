            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS to the Letter which I mention'd in my last, I shall only
reflect upon some Passages in the Chronological part of it;
the Examination of the whole I leave to the Ingenious
person, that is more especially concern'd.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman, that writ the Letter, manifests in one passage
of it, that his Chronology doth according to his own Judgment
depend much upon this, that the <hi>Sanballat</hi> in <hi>Iosephus</hi> is not the
same with the <hi>Sanballat</hi> in <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> For <hi>pag.</hi> 19 speaking of the
Convocation, (he says,) that <hi>by making his</hi> Sanballat (i.e. <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s)
<hi>the same with Nehemiahs, it appears, that they follow</hi> Scaliger <hi>and</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visius
<hi>in their Chronology:</hi> So that whosoever makes him to be the
same <hi>Sanballat</hi> that is mention<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in both, he, in this Gentlemans
judgment, follows <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Calvisius</hi> in their Chronology.
Of which he gives this account, <hi>pag.</hi> 18. They begin <hi>Daniel</hi>'s 70
weeks in <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> his time, and make <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
to be <hi>Mnemon,</hi> instead of <hi>Longimanus,</hi> as the <hi>Darius</hi> mention'd by
him, they make not to be <hi>Nothus,</hi> but <hi>Cod<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mannus,</hi> and the Priest,
that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> depriv'd, to be <hi>Manasses,</hi> the same that we read of
in <hi>Josephus.</hi> All this (says he) <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Calvisius</hi> are for, and
he would persuade us, that the <hi>Convocation</hi> are also for it, but he
himself is against it.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Convocation,</hi> I believe they do not say that <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s
<hi>Sanballat</hi> is the same with <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s; but telling us out of <hi>Iosephus,</hi>
that <hi>Jaddus</hi> and <hi>Manasses</hi> fell at variance, that <hi>Manasses</hi> married
<hi>Sanballat</hi>'s Daughter, and was remov'd from the Priesthood,
they set in the Margin, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 28. from whence this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
concludes, that they make his <hi>Sanballat</hi> the same with <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>'s;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105652:3"/>
and <hi>by their so doing</hi> (says he) <hi>it appears that they follow</hi> Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r
<hi>and</hi> Calvisius <hi>in their Chronology.</hi> But against the necessity of
this consequence, I argue thus; If every one that makes <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s
<hi>Sanballat</hi> the same with <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s, must follow <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
in their Chronology,</hi> and so make <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to be
<hi>Mnemon,</hi> not <hi>Longimanus;</hi> how comes it, that so many excellently
Learned Men, Bishop <hi>Montague, Functius, &amp;c.</hi> do make the
same <hi>Sanballat</hi> to be spoken of in both, and yet hold, that <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
<hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was <hi>Longimanus?</hi> If they did not follow <hi>Scaliger</hi>
and <hi>Calvisius</hi> (notwithstanding that they held the aforesaid opinion,
touching <hi>Sanballat</hi>) then this Gentleman concluded too hastily,
that the <hi>Convocation</hi> did follow them. Besides, the only reason
which this Gentleman gives, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. why, if we hold <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
and <hi>Iosephus</hi> to speak of the same <hi>Sanballat,</hi> it is necessary to make
<hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to be <hi>Mnemon,</hi> not <hi>Longimanus,</hi> is because the
<hi>Sanballat,</hi> that was the Adversary of the <hi>Iews</hi> in the 29th year of
<hi>Longimanus,</hi> must have been much above 120 years old in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s
time. But Bishop <hi>Montague</hi> answers readily to this, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
instances of several persons, that have liv'd to much above
120 years.</p>
            <p>Further, why should not this Gentleman have thought that the
<hi>Convocation</hi> follow'd <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> rather than <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visius?</hi>
For it is known, that <hi>Sulpitius, &amp;c.</hi> begun <hi>Daniel</hi>'s weeks
in <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> his time, (long before <hi>Scaliger</hi> did;) as also he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s building the Walls and Gates of the City, to the
Reign of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon;</hi> and I believe that the Reverend
Clergy of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> studied such ancient Writers as <hi>Sulpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
more than they did <hi>Scaliger,</hi> or other Neotericks<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> As to <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visius,</hi>
they might not have seen his Chronology, yea, I questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whether it was extant, when the <hi>Convocation</hi>-Book was finish<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d,
and then there is no reason why they should be said to follow
<hi>Calvisius.</hi> I have inlarg'd on this the more, because I conceive
that this Gentleman hath made too bold with the <hi>Convocation</hi> in
this passage, (as both he and others have done in other things;)
for by making <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s <hi>Sanballat</hi> the same with <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s, it doth
not appear, that they follow'd either <hi>Scaliger</hi> or <hi>Calvisius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:105652:3"/>
To return to that which we were saying at first, since this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
Chronology in his judgment depends much upon this,
that <hi>Josephus</hi>'s <hi>Sanballat</hi> is not the same with <hi>Nehemiahs,</hi> it will not
be amiss to examine what this Gentleman hath to say, <hi>pag.</hi> 11.
against his being the same. <hi>Iosephas</hi> (says he) <hi>describes him by
those Characters, by which we may be sure that he was not the same</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat.
If you ask what Characters they are, (he says) <hi>First, that
this was a</hi> Chuthaean, <hi>of that race from which the</hi> Samaritans <hi>came; and
f<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rther, that he was sent to be Governour of</hi> Samaria <hi>by the last</hi> Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;
whereas this Gentleman tells us of this other <hi>Sanballat,</hi> that he
was a <hi>Moabite of</hi> Horonaim, <hi>whom</hi> Nehemiah <hi>found in</hi> Palestine 100
<hi>years before in</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>his time.</hi> But first, The Scripture doth
not plainly say of <hi>Nehemiahs Sanballat,</hi> either that he was a <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite,</hi>
or of <hi>Horonaim;</hi> it only calls him the <hi>Horonite,</hi> whether
from <hi>Horonaim,</hi> or from some other place, is uncertain. But to
pass this, secondly, He might be a <hi>Chuthaean</hi> originally, and yet
his Habitation might have been for the most part at <hi>Horonaim,</hi>
and he thereupon call'd the <hi>Horonite.</hi> Thirdly, Arch-bishop
<hi>Vsher, Grotius,</hi> and others think that he was Toparch, or Deputy-Governour
of the <hi>Moabites;</hi> and it is in no wise improbable, that
the same person, who was constituted Governour of the <hi>Moabites</hi>
by <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> should afterwards be advanc'd to be Governour of
<hi>Samaria</hi> by <hi>Darius.</hi> Fourthly, As to that of 100 years, they who
hold <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to be <hi>Longimanus,</hi> must grant that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi>
found <hi>Sanballat</hi> in <hi>Palestine</hi> 100 years before the time of
the last <hi>Darius,</hi> (and they say that he liv'd to so great an age that
that might be,) but <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> and those that follow him, must
and do deny it. Thus it appears, that we cannot be sure that
he was not the same <hi>Sanballat,</hi> either by the Characters by which
<hi>Josephus</hi> describes him, or by any thing which this Gentleman
saith.</p>
            <p>As this Gentleman made bold with the Convocation, so he
also makes bold with the <hi>Iewish Chronologers,</hi> though I willingly
grant that they deserve not that regard which the <hi>Convocation</hi>
doth. He tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. that <hi>they make the whole time of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Temple, till the sixth year of</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great (in which sixth
year they say he came up against</hi> Jerusalem) <hi>to be but 34 years,</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105652:4"/>
for this he cites <hi>Ganz, pag.</hi> 57, and 64. But indeed the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Writers differ among themselves about the time of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, after the finishing of the <hi>second
Temple,</hi> yet <hi>Ganz</hi> expresses his Opinion very plainly, <hi>viz</hi> that
the time of the <hi>second Temple,</hi> to the first year of <hi>Alexander,</hi> was
34 years, but till the sixth year of <hi>Alexander</hi> it was forty years,
and so we read in <hi>Iuchasin</hi> fol. 13. 2. that <hi>Alexander</hi> came to
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> forty years after the building of the <hi>Temple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Gentleman makes more bold with the <hi>Iewish</hi> Writers,
when he makes them to say of <hi>Iaddus</hi> the High Priest, and all the
Elders of <hi>Israel,</hi> that <hi>they made a Covenant with</hi> Alexander, (<hi>though</hi>
Darius <hi>was then living,</hi>) for which he cites <hi>Ganz, p.</hi> 59. But these
are not <hi>Ganz</hi> his words; he only says that <hi>Alexander made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with</hi> Jaddus, whom he calls <hi>Simeon the just:</hi> And I believe
you will be strangely surpriz'd when I tell you from R. <hi>Abraham
F. David</hi> his <hi>Cabala,</hi> what that Covenant was: He covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(says he) with the High Priest, that every Child that was
born to any of the Priests that year, should be call'd <hi>Alexander,</hi>
after his name, and that they should begin their <hi>AEra contractuum</hi>
from him.</p>
            <p>Iosephus, l. 11. c. 5, and 8. <hi>acquaints us, that both</hi> Nehemiah
<hi>and</hi> Sanballat <hi>liv'd to old age: and of</hi> Nehemiah, <hi>this Gentleman
saith,</hi> pag. 8. No doubt he lived to a very great age, for he was Cupbearer
to King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in the 20th years of his Reign. We may suppose him
to have been then about 25 years of age; after that he liv'd to see the
High Priesthood pass from Father to Son for four Generations: And he
saw a fifth coming in view, namely, <hi>Jaddua,</hi> whom we suppose to have
been then about 30 years old. All this might very well be, if <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
were born 470 years before Christ, and writ in the year 347 before
Christ, then he was about 104 years o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. <hi>There are this Gentleman's
own words out of which we must pick his sense as well as we
can; and when we have done our best, I doubt we shall scarce
understand, either how the things cohere, or how they prove,
that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> liv'd to a very great age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I cannot see the coherence, particularly of that last passage,
if <hi>Nehemiah were born</hi> 470 <hi>years before Christ, and writ in the</hi> 347<hi>th year
before Christ, then he was about</hi> 104 <hi>years old;</hi> for from the year 470
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105652:4"/>
before Christ, to the year 347 before him are 123 years; so that
this Gentleman had express'd himself more coherently, if he
had said, <hi>Then he was about</hi> 124 <hi>years old.</hi> Some perhaps will
say, that 347 is the Printer's mistake for 374; for this Gentleman
says, <hi>pag</hi> 1. that <hi>Nehemiah writ his Book Anno</hi> 374, <hi>before Christ.</hi>
Well, we now then suppose <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to have lived from the
year 470 before Christ to the year 374; but then he would not
have been about 104 years old, but about 96; so that I despair
still of making things cohere. But then:</p>
            <p>2. I cannot see how all together proves that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> lived to a
very great age; for 1. They are only Suppositions, which make
up a great part of what is said, and those can prove nothing.
2. There is nothing certain, but that after <hi>Nehemiah</hi> came from
<hi>Susa</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he liv'd to see the High Priesthood pass from
Father to Son for some Generations; but unless we were certain
for how many Generations, whether four or three, or only
two; as also how many years every Person enjoy'd the High-Priest's
Function, we cannot prove from thence, to what age
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> liv'd. 3. When this Gentleman says, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
saw the Priesthood pass from Father to Son for four Generations;
his meaning is, that it pass'd from <hi>Ioiakim</hi> to <hi>Eliashib</hi> from <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ashib</hi>
to <hi>Ioiada,</hi> from <hi>Ioiada</hi> to <hi>Johanan;</hi> and withal he begins
his computation in the last year of <hi>Ioiakim,</hi> and ends it in the
first of <hi>Iohanan;</hi> so that the time of <hi>Eliashib</hi>'s and <hi>Joiada</hi>'s enjoying
the Priesthood, being added to the 25 years, which he is suppos'd
to have liv'd when he came from <hi>Susa</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is in effect all
the time we have to make up <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s age, according to this
Gentleman.</p>
            <p>He troubles himself much about the time of <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s writing
his Book: 1. He affirms, <hi>p.</hi> 6. that it was writ after the Death of
<hi>Longimanus,</hi> and in or after the time of his Successor <hi>Darius.
This</hi> (says he) <hi>is certain, for in his Book he mentions the Reign of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
<hi>the Persian:</hi> But why may we not think, notwithstanding
this, that the rest of the Book was writ before the Death of <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi>
and that this touching the Reign of <hi>Darius,</hi> and a few other
passages, might be inserted by <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> or some other after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
2. He insists upon it, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> writ, when
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105652:5"/>
the Reign of <hi>Darius</hi> was expired: <hi>The Hebrew words</hi> (says he) <hi>shew
it, for there</hi> (i.e. Neh.12. 22.) <hi>it is said, that the heads of the</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,
<hi>and also the Priests were recorded</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>over
or throughout the Reign of</hi> Darius; Our Translation hath, <hi>to the Reign
of Darius;</hi> other Translations, <hi>in the Reign, &amp;c.</hi> but these not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring,
he must, without Example or Warrant, to serve his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,</hi>
translate <hi>Over or throughout the Reign of</hi> Darius. There is no
question, but that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> sometimes signifies <hi>Over,</hi> as that is the same
with <hi>Above;</hi> but he should have alledg'd some other Text or Texts
of Scripture, in which it signifies <hi>Over,</hi> in the sense of his <hi>Through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi>
or some Authority for it; and when he doth this, he doth
something. But let the words signifie what they will, they
must be understood as he would have them, <hi>which appears</hi> (says he)
<hi>by what followeth in the next verse, where it is said, that the Heads of the</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
<hi>were recorded in the Book of the Chronicles, till the days of</hi> Johanan,
i.e. <hi>till he came to be High-Priest.</hi> Yea, rather the contrary appears
from thence, if we will acquiesce in Archbishop <hi>Vsher</hi>'s judgment,
for he (in his Annals <hi>A. M.</hi> 3589.) makes <hi>Iohanan</hi> to have been
High Priest in the Reign of <hi>Darius,</hi> i.e. <hi>Nothus;</hi> and if he was so,
then these words, till the days of <hi>Johanan, Neh.</hi> 12. 23. cannot
prove that the meaning must be <hi>Throughout the Reign of Darius,
v.</hi> 22. but (if any thing) the contrary.</p>
            <p>Here and elsewhere I press this Gentleman with Archbishop
<hi>Vsher</hi>'s Authority, because he alledges him so oft in his Letter;
and declares his great esteem of his judgment, <hi>The most Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Primate was as well a great Chronologer as a good Textuary;</hi> so. <hi>pag.</hi> 7.
and <hi>pag</hi> 9. when he had told how he supposed <hi>Iaddus</hi> born at
such a time in compliance with the most Learned Primate, he
adds these words, <hi>I attribute very much to his judgment in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
3. This Gentleman makes <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to have writ his
Book when <hi>Johanan</hi> came to be High-Priest, (see <hi>pag.</hi> 7. also 9,
and 10.) but if you demand his proof of this, he only saith,
<hi>pag.</hi> 9. that he hath <hi>very good ground</hi> for it; but he is not so kind as
to tell what it is. So that by all that he hath said concerning
<hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s age, and writing his Book, he hath only demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that it cannot be determin'd particularly to what age he
liv'd, or at what time he writ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:105652:5"/>
This Gentleman also in <hi>pag.</hi> 7. troubles himself about <hi>Neh.</hi>
12. 22, 23. He says, that <hi>Nehemiah in them tells us, that as for the</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, <hi>that were in the days of</hi> Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan <hi>and</hi> Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua,
<hi>the heads of those</hi> Levites; <hi>and also the Priests, all that were in
the Reign of</hi> Darius Nothus, <hi>were recorded in the Book of Chronicles:
but afterwards the Priests were not recorded, but only the Heads of the</hi>
Levites, <hi>and those only during the High Priesthood of</hi> Eliashib <hi>and</hi>
Joiada. By <hi>Afterwards</hi> here, nothing can be meant, but after the
Reign of <hi>Darius Nothus;</hi> and so the Gentleman saith <hi>Afterwards,</hi>
i.e. <hi>after the Reign of Darius Nothus the Priests were not recorded, but
only the heads of the</hi> Levites; and then, when he adds, <hi>and those only
during the High Priesthood of Eliashib</hi> and <hi>Joiada;</hi> it cannot be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but that he makes <hi>Eliashib</hi> to have been High-Priest <hi>after the
Reign of Darius Nothus;</hi> being contrary herein (that I may say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Archbishop <hi>Vsher</hi>) to himself; for <hi>pag.</hi> 10. he makes
<hi>Joiada</hi> to have succeeded <hi>Eliashib</hi> five years before the end of
<hi>Darius</hi>'s Reign. But to pass this, the Gentleman says, that <hi>the heads
of the</hi> Levites <hi>were recorded only during the High Priesthood of</hi> Eliakim
<hi>and</hi> Joiada, <hi>who were then dead, but not of</hi> Johanan. But if the
heads of the <hi>Levites</hi> in the days of <hi>Iohanan,</hi> and so in the days of
<hi>Iaddua</hi> were not recorded, I would gladly know why they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<hi>v.</hi> 22. as well as those in the days of <hi>Eliashib</hi> and <hi>Ioiada.</hi>
But his giving us both so strange a translation of part of <hi>v.</hi> 22.
and so strange an Interpretation of the two verses proceeded
from hence, that he thought the <hi>Darius</hi> spoken of, was necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Darius Nothus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thence also proceeded that which follows in the same <hi>pag.</hi> 7.
<hi>As for</hi> Jaddua, <hi>he is mention'd both here</hi> (i e Neh. 12. 22.) <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this Chapter,</hi> (i.e. <hi>v.</hi> 11.) <hi>not as being High Priest then,
(how could he be in his Father's days?) but only as being then living,
and Heir apparent of the High Priesthood; so the words are understood by
the most Learned Primate:</hi> By <hi>Then,</hi> this Gentleman means the
time when the Book of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was written, which he fansies
was when <hi>Jaddua</hi>'s Father, <hi>Johanan,</hi> entred upon the High-Priest's
Function; hence is that Parenthesis, <hi>how could he be in his Father's
days?</hi> But it hath appear'd already, that it is a Groundless
fancy, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> writ his Book at that time, and so all this that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105652:6"/>
is buile upon it, falls of it self. As to the Primate's judgment,
I attribute very much to it; but this Gentleman that takes leave
to depart from it when he thinks fit, cannot reasonably deny the
like liberty to others.</p>
            <p>Page 12. We are told concerning him that married the
Daughter of <hi>Sanballat</hi> the <hi>Horonite,</hi> that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (<hi>ch.</hi> 3. 28.) <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
him one of the Sons of</hi> Ioiada, <hi>the Son of</hi> Eliashib <hi>the High Priest,</hi> and
that this is <hi>plain enough to shew that he was the younger Brother of</hi> Joha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan
<hi>the Father of</hi> Jaddus. But I deny that it is plain enough to
shew it, and my Ground is from this Gentleman's own words:
<hi>Pag.</hi> 5. he says that <hi>Iohanan the High-Priest is called the Son of</hi>
Eliashib (<hi>Neh.</hi> 12 23.) <hi>who indeed was his Grandfather, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was</hi> Joiada, <hi>Neh.</hi> 12, 10. Just so here <hi>Iaddus</hi>'s Brother is call'd
one of the Sons of <hi>Joiada,</hi> who indeed was his Grandfather,
and his Father was <hi>Iohanan.</hi> 'Tis usual to call Grandsons by the
name of Sons: So that with the greatest part of the Learned Men that
have writ on this subject, we may still believe not the Uncle, but
the Brother of <hi>Iaddus</hi> to be the person spoken of, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.
28. and that <hi>Iosephus</hi> his Narration concerning <hi>Manasseh,</hi> is an
excellent comment upon that Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I willingly acknowledge, that I want some light to help me to
discover the necessity of those consequences,</hi> pag 9. If <hi>Jaddus</hi>
was but 30 years old when he came to be High-Priest, then the age of
<hi>Joiakim</hi> when he dyed, must have been at least 90 years, his Son <hi>Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shib</hi>
at least 62, his Son <hi>Joiada</hi> near 70, his Son <hi>Johanan</hi> near 60,
and each of these it is very probable much more; and four of these must have
been born when their Fathers were but 20 years old. How these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
can be made out, I do not apprehend.</p>
            <p>It remains that we examine that view of the years of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Kings, and <hi>Jewish</hi> High-Priests, which he gives us <hi>pag.</hi> 10.
and we shall quickly find that his Chronology therein is as to a
great part of it meerly conjectural, or at the best very uncertain.
Of the time of <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s writing his Book, I have shew'd the
uncertainty above. This Gentleman tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. that <hi>Jaddus
might have been born any year before his Father</hi> Johanan <hi>came to be High-Priest,</hi>
and that he <hi>suppos'd him born 30 years before in compliance with
the most Learned Primate:</hi> Which Primates Judgment, he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105652:6"/>
this, departs from in other particulars of this view,
(as to omit other instances) when the Primate re<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s
coming from <hi>Sasa</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to the 454th year before Christ,
this Gentleman refers it to the 445th year before him.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchs, the View out of <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s <hi>Canon,</hi>
makes <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> to have reigned 19 years, <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon</hi>
46, <hi>Ochus</hi> 21, <hi>Arses.</hi> 2. But <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> (whose Authority
may at least counterbalance <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s) gives only 43 years to
<hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> but 23 to <hi>Ochus,</hi> and speaks of <hi>Arses</hi> his
third year (see <hi>Diod. Sic. l.</hi> 13. <hi>l.</hi> 15, and <hi>l.</hi> 16.) <hi>Sulpitus Severus</hi>
also gives 23 to <hi>Ochus,</hi> and 3 to <hi>Arses.</hi> The same <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi>
allots 62 years to <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> which <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
doth also, and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esias</hi> (who had the greatest advantages of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
how long he reign'd) gives to <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> 35 years: So
that the best Authors differing thus one from another how can
we determine how long they reign'd. I have not <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s <hi>Canon</hi>
by me, but take it for granted, that he allots the number of years
forementioned to these Kings.</p>
            <p>As for the High Priests, the View out of <hi>Georgius Syncellus</hi>
assigns to <hi>Eliashib</hi> 34 years; but the <hi>Chronicon Alexandrinum</hi> gives
him 40 years, as the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> apud <hi>Scaliger.</hi> also doth.</p>
            <p>It is somewhat strange, that this Gentleman should refer the
death of <hi>Ioiakim</hi> to <hi>An.</hi> 445. before Christ, and yet refer his Son
<hi>Eli<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shib</hi>'s being High Priest to the year after: I had thought that
the Son being Heir apparent to the High Priesthood, had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
immediately upon the Father's Death. It is the more
strange because having said <hi>pag.</hi> 8. that it appears that <hi>Ioiakim</hi>
dyed the same year that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> Government began; he
gives this reason for it, <hi>for his Son</hi> Eliashib <hi>was High Priest at the
time when the Wall of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>was building:</hi> For I believe that the
Wall of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was building yea, was finish'd the same year
that <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s Government began. And if so, it is more certain,
that <hi>Eliashib</hi> was High Priest the same year that his Government
began; than it is, that <hi>Ioiakim</hi> dyed that year. Yea, but
says this Gentleman, <hi>It is certain, that</hi> Joiakim <hi>was High Priest
within the time while</hi> Nehemiah <hi>was Governour.</hi> And this he
thinks may be prov'd from <hi>Neh.</hi> 12. 26. where the words are,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105652:7"/>
               <hi>These were in the days of</hi> Joiakim, <hi>the Son of</hi> Jeshua, <hi>the Son of</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zadak,
<hi>and in the days of</hi> Nehemiah <hi>the Governour.</hi> Now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
from these words, that <hi>Joiakim</hi> was High Priest within the
time while <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was Governour; it is said in the same Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that <hi>all</hi> Israel <hi>in the days of</hi> Zerubbabel, <hi>and in the days of</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,
<hi>gave the portions of the Singers,</hi> Neh.12. 47. Is it certain
from hence, that <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> govern'd for some
time together? I say then, that it is more certain (particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
from <hi>Neh.</hi> 3.1.) that <hi>Eliashib</hi> was High Priest the same year
that <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s Government began; than it is, that <hi>Ioiakim</hi> dyed
the same year.</p>
            <p>This, Sir, may suffice to give you a taste of the Gentleman's
Chronology. I only add that I am</p>
