         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Doctor <hi>Field</hi> of the Church, lib. 5. cap 11. Bernard. ſer. 1. in Annunt. B. <hi>Andrews</hi> Sermons of the Nativity, p. 99. Doctor <hi>Bois</hi> his Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Pſalms for ſeverall Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, part. 1. pag. 28.</note> have invented this pretty expreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When God (ſay they) created <hi>Adam,</hi> he gave him all excellent and precious virtues, as Truth to inſtruct him, Juſtice to direct him, Mercy to preſerve him, and Peace to delight him with all pleaſing correſpondency: but that when he fell away, and forgate all the good which God had done for him, theſe virtues left their lower dwelling, and ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back to him that gave them, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing report what was fallen out on earth, and earneſtly moving the Allmighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this his wretched and forlorn crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet in a very different ſort and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: For Juſtice pleaded for the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſinfull man, and called for the puniſhment he had worthily deſerved; and Truth required the performance of that which God had threatned: but Mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated for miſerable man, made out of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114764:21"/>
duſt of the earth, ſeduced by Satan, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled with the ſhews of ſeeming good; and Peace no leſſe carefully ſought to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the wrath of the diſpleaſed God, and to reconcile the Creature to the Creator. When God had heard the contrary pleas and deſires of theſe moſt excellent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ſaw that there was no other means to give them all ſatisfaction, it was reſolved on in the <hi>high Councell</hi> of the <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity,</hi> that one of thoſe <hi>ſacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> ſhould become <hi>Man,</hi> that by taking to him the nature of <hi>Man,</hi> he might par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in his miſeries, and be ſubject to his puniſhments; and by conjoyning his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature,</hi> and perfection with the ſame, might fill it with all grace, and heavenly excellency. And thus were the deſires of theſe ſo contrary petitioners all ſatisfied; for man was puniſhed, as Gods Juſtice urged; that was performed, which God had threatned, as Truth required; the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender was pitied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Mercy intreated; and God and Man were reconciled, as Peace deſired; and ſo was fulfilled that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 85. 10. Mercy and Truth have met together, Righteouſneſſe and Peace have kiſſed each other.</hi>

                  <p>2. <hi>Secure Conſciences</hi> are ſuch, as want not ſo much an eye to diſcover ſin, as a good tongue to tell of it, and to find fault with it.

(we know) makes not a Summer; neither of one example, without a precept, muſt we conclude any thing from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
