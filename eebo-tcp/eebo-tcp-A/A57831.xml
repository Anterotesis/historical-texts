            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Sir <hi>Dudley Digs,</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doe professe, that as my Affection, my Reason, and my Iudgement, goe strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the scope and drift of this Proposition; so shall a good part of my poore fortune, when it comes to execution.</p>
            <p>For to my understanding, there was never propounded in Parliament, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe more proper for this kingdome, nor of more pregnant advantage to it,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50505:3"/>
whether we consider the nature of our situation, or the quality of our Enemies Forces.</p>
            <p>As wee are an Iland, it concernes our very being to have store of ships to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us, and also our well-being by their Trade to enrich us.</p>
            <p>This association for the <hi>West Indies,</hi> when it shall bee regulated and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by act of Parliament, and thereby secured from the violence and injury of any intruding hand, it will certainely give many men encouragement &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, voluntarily to bring in large and liberall contributions, towards so noble, so profitable an Enterprise. So that in short time, we shall see many new ships built, many brave men employed, and enabled for the service of their country, none of this money shall be carried out of the kingdome, but laid out for ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, which is the defence of it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon our owne men, who must be fed and maintained, though they stay
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50505:3"/>
at home. For this, wee shall reape the fruit of whatsoever benefit Plantation, Trafficke, or Purchase can procure us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides honour and security.</p>
            <p>Now, let us a little consider the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my wee are to encounter, the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> They are not his great territories which make him so powerfull, and so troublesome to all Christendome. For it is very well knowne, that <hi>Spaine</hi> it selfe is but weake in men, and barren of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Commodities. As for his other Territories, they lye divided and asunder, which is a weaknesse in its selfe; besides, they are held by force, and maintained at an extraordinary charge. Insomuch, as although he be a great King, yet is he like that great Gyant, who was said to have 100 hands, but he had 50 bellies to feed, so that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atably, hee had no more hands then another man.</p>
            <p>No Sir, they are his Mines in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> which minister fuell to feed his vast ambitious desire of universall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50505:4"/>
It is the money he hath from thence, which makes him able to levy, and pay souldiers in all places; and to keepe an army continually on foot, ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade and endanger his Neighbours.</p>
            <p>So that we have no other way, but to endeavour to cut him up at root, and seeke to impeach, or to supplant him in the <hi>West Indies.</hi> By part of which course, that famous Queene of most glorious memory, had heretofore almost brought him on his knees. And this our underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (if it please God to blesse it) must needs effect it sooner and quicker: the whole body of the Kingdome being united and concur<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing in a perpetuall supply to this action, so that he wil have no free time given him to rest.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this will be a meanes not only to save, but to fill His Majesties Coffers, enabling the people to give him liberally, and often; the Kings ships will have little to doe, but to guard the coasts, for the Sea-warre will chiefly bee made
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50505:4"/>
at the charge of the subject. Thus, (Sir <hi>Dudley Digs</hi>) I doubt not but that in short time, both King and people shall be safe at home, and feared abroad.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I shall be very glad to heare any man make objections against this Designe, so that hee doe it with an intention to refine and perfect the worke; but if any shall speake against it with a mind to hinder and destroy it, I must entreat him to pardon me, if I doe scarce thinke him to bee a good English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
