            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Government of <hi>England,</hi> in particular is either <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Civil</hi> or <hi>Military,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King is ſupreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in all Cauſes and over all Perſons; from him is derived all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Jurisdiction. He is <hi>quaſi In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectus Agens, Forma formarum, vel potius Mundi Anglici Deus,</hi> And the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95252:13"/>
Mobile</hi> thereof, from whence all the Inferiour Orbes derive their Motion, is that Noble Honourable and Reverend Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly called <hi>Concilium ſecretum, Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum vel Continuum Regis Concilium,</hi> which is a Court of ſuch Antiquity and Honour that it may be ſaid to be higher then the higheſt Court of <hi>England</hi> (as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is uſually called) for our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not only much younger, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may truly be ſaid to be the Productions of the Kings Privy Council as appears by the words of the Writ for ſummoning of a Parliament. This is the higheſt watch Tower of the Nation, wherein the King with all his good Centinels and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men about him takes a careful ſurvey of all his Dominions, and ſometimes of all the Domininons of the World as any of them have any Relation to his, where he Conſults and Contrives how to protect his numberleſs Subjects, not onley from Injuries amongſt themſelves, but from the wrongs and violences of all other Nations, where he doth conſult and watch for the publick good, Honour, Defence, Profit, and Peace of all his people.</p>
            <p>Before the later end of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third. <hi>Quod proviſum fuit per Regem &amp; Concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſuum Privatum ſigilloque Regis confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum proculdubio legis vigorem habuit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Spelman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Primitive and ordinary way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in <hi>England,</hi> was by the King and and his Privy Council, and all our Kings
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95252:13"/>
have acted much by it, determining Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of great importance, ſoemtimes touching Lands and Rights between party and party, whereof there are very many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, and the Judges of <hi>England</hi> in ſome difficult caſes were not wont to give Judgment, until they had firſt conſulted the King or his Privy Council. Moreover the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, have oft-times tranſmitted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of high moment to the King and his Privy Council, as by long experience and wiſdom better able to judge of, and by ſecrecy and expedition better able to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſome State Affairs, then all the Lords and Commons together.</p>
            <p>At preſent, the King and his Privy Council take Cogniſance of few matters that may well be determined by the known Laws and ordinary Courts of Juſtice, but onely, as aforeſaid, conſult for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, Honour, Defence, Safety, and Benefit of the Realm, not medling with matters that concern Freeholds, but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Appeal and ſudden Emergencies.</p>
            <p>The Lords of the Privy Council are as it were a part of the King, incorporate with him and his Cares, bearing upon their Shoulders that great weight, that otherwiſe would lye wholly upon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, wherefore of ſuch high value and eſteem they have always been, that if a man did but ſtrike in the Houſe of a Privy Counſellor, or elſewhere in his preſence, he was grievouſly Fined for the ſame,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95252:14"/>
and to conſpire the death of any of them was made Felony, in any of the Kings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants within the <hi>Check Roll,</hi> and to kill one of them was High Treaſon.</p>
            <p>A Privy Councellor, though but a Gentleman, ſhall have precedence of all Knights, Baronets, and younger Sons of all Barons and Viſcounts.</p>
            <p>The Subſtance of their Oath is, That they ſhall according to their power and diſcretion, Truly, Juſtly, and Evenly, Counſel and Adviſe the King, in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be Treated in His Majeſties Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that they ſhall keep ſecret the Kings Counſel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Force of this Oath, and the Cuſtom of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> a Privy Counſellor is made without any Patent or Grant, and to continue onely during the Life of the King that makes him, nor ſo long unleſs the King pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Heretofore there hath been uſually a Lord Preſident of the Kings Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, a Dignity of ſo high Repute, that by a Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, he is to take place in publick, next to the Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>England:</hi> His Office was to ſpeak firſt to buſineſs, to report to His Majeſty the Paſſages and State of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes tranſacted at Council Table. The laſt Lord Preſident was the Earl of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> Father of the preſent Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine.</p>
            <p>To his Privy Councellors the King of <hi>England,</hi> may declare or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95252:14"/>
from them whatſoever he alone judgeth fit and expedient, <hi>qua in re</hi> (ſaith the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sir <hi>Tho. Smith) abſolutisſimum eſt hoc Regnum Angliae prae Venetorum Ducatu aut Lacedaemoniorum Principatu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King with the advice of his Privy Council doth publiſh Proclamations bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Subject, provided that they are not contrary to Statute or Common Law.</p>
            <p>In caſes where the publick peace ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or profit of the Kingdom may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered for want of ſpeedy redreſs, there the King with his Privy Council uſually make uſe of an abſolute power if need be.</p>
            <p>The Members of this moſt Honorable Council are ſuch as his own free Will and meer Motion ſhall pleaſe to chooſe, and are commonly men of the higheſt rank, eminent for Eſtates, Wiſdom, Courage, Integrity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And becauſe there are few caſes of moment ſo temporal, but that they may ſome way relate to ſpiritual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, therefore according to the general Rules of Policy and Government, which God himſelf ordained amongſt his choſen people the Jews, the Privy Council (as well as the great Council of Parliament) is compoſed of Spiritual as well as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral perſons, ſome of the principal Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> have in all times been choſen by His Majeſty to be of his Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>

            </list>
            <p>Theſe are all to wait on his Majeſty, and at Council Board ſit in their Order, bare-headed when His Majeſty preſides.</p>
            <p>At all Debates the loweſt delivers his opinion firſt, that ſo he may be the more free, and the King laſt of all declares his Judgment, and thereby determines the mater in Debate.</p>
            <p>The Time and Place of holding this Council is wholly at the Kings pleaſure, but it is moſt commonly held in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95252:16"/>
on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> out of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament time and Term time, and in the Afternoon, in time of Parliament and Term.</p>
            <p>A Council is ſeldom or never held with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Preſence of one of the Secretaries of State, of whoſe Office and Dignity much more conſiderable in <hi>England</hi> than in other Nations, take here this brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>The Kings of <hi>England</hi> had antiently but one Secretary of State, until about the end of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight his Reign, it was thought fit, that weighty and important Office ſhould be diſcharged by two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, both of equal authority, and both ſtiled <hi>Principal Secretaries of State</hi> In thoſe days, and ſome while after, they ſate not at Council Board, but having prepared their buſineſs in a Room adjoyning to the Council-Chamber, they came in, and ſtood on either hand of the King; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was debated at the Table, until the Secretaries had gone through with their Propoſals. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſeldom coming to Council, that Method was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and the two Secretaries took their places as Privy Counſellors; which Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they have retained and enjoyed ever ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Council is ſeldom or never held without the preſence of one of them at the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Their employment being of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary truſt and multiplicity, renders them moſt conſiderable both in the eyes of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95252:17"/>
King, upon whom they attend every day as occaſion requires; and of the Subjects alſo, whoſe requeſts and deſires are for the moſt part lodged in their hands, to be preſented to the King, and always to make diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches thereupon, according to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Anſwers and Directions.</p>
            <p>As for Forraign Affairs, the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries divide all the Kingdoms and Nations, which have intercourſe of buſineſs with the King of <hi>England,</hi> into two grand Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereof each Secretary taketh one to himſelf, receiving all Letters and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes from, and making all diſpatches to, the ſeveral Princes and States compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended within his own Province.</p>
            <p>But in all matters of home concern, whether they relate to the Publick, or to particular perſons, both the Secretaries do equally and indiſtinctly receive and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch whatſoever is brought to them, be it for the Church, the Militia, or private Grants, Pardons, Diſpenſations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have this ſpecial Honour, that if either of them be a Baron, he taketh place, and hath the precedence of all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the ſame degree, though otherwiſe by their Creation ſome of them might have right to precede him; and a Knight in like manner, if he hath no other qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>They have their ſeveral Lodgings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them in all the Kings Houſes, as well for their own Accommodation, as for their Office, and thoſe that attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95252:17"/>
it. They have alſo a very liberal Diet at the Kings charge, or Board-wages in lieu of it.</p>
            <p>To ſhew how conſiderable their place is, their ſetled allowance from the King in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary and Penſion is little leſs than Two thouſand pounds <hi>Sterling per annum,</hi> to each of them.</p>
            <p>The Secretaries and Clerks whom they imploy under them are wholly at their own choice, and have no dependance upon any other power or perſon beſides themſelves.</p>
            <p>They have the Cuſtody of that Seal of the King, which is properly called the <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>; the uſe and application whereof, gives denomination to an Office conſtantly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Court called the <hi>Signet Office,</hi> wherein there are four Clerks, who wait alternately by Months, and prepare ſuch things as are to paſs the Signet in order to the Privy Seal or Great Seal.</p>
            <p>The preſent Secretaries of State are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> whom for his eminent Services at home and abroad, both in War and Peace, His Majeſty was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to advance into the place of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Nicholas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Sir <hi>John Trevor,</hi> who for his great abilities and ſuccesful Negotiations had that Truſt and Honour conferred upon him, when Sir <hi>William Morice,</hi> late Secretary of State, was by His Majeſties gracious conſent permitted to retire from buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Waiting on the Privy Council there are Four Clarks in Ordinary, who waite by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95252:18"/>
Months each one, he that comes in, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a week before and a week after his Month to aſſiſt there.</p>
            <p>Their Office is to read what is brought before the Council and draw up all ſuch Orders as the King and Lords ſhall direct, and cauſe them to be Regiſtred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe that follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Walker,</hi> Sir <hi>John Nicolas,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Southwel</hi>; Salaries to each 250. <hi>l.</hi> beſides Fees for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſide the forenamed Officers there is a Keeper of the Records, <hi>John Woolly</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> no Fee.</p>
            <p>Two Keepers of the Council Chamber, Fee to each 45 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirty Meſſengers, whereof Ten at a time by turns waite every Moneth, Fee to each 45 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe upon Occaſion are ſent by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Lords of the Privy Council to fetch any Perſon, under the Degree of a Baron, and to keep him Priſoner in his Houſe till farther order.</p>
            <p>Attending on the Secretaries are the Clerks of the <hi>Signet,</hi> or <hi>Little Seal,</hi> which is always in the Cuſtody of the Secretaries, for ſealing the Kings Private Letters and for all ſuch Grants as paſs His Majeſties hands by Bill aſſigned.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Clerks there are four, Sir <hi>John Nicholas</hi> Knight of the Bath, Sir <hi>Philip
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95252:18"/>
Warwick</hi> Knight, <hi>Trumbal</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and <hi>Sidney Bear</hi> Eſquire. Theſe have no Fee from the King, but onely Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, which at Penſion is 200 <hi>l.</hi> yearly. Their Office is in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> they waite by Month, each of them three Months in a year. One of them alwayes attends the Court where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it removes, and by Warrant from the King, or Secretaries of State, or Lords of the Council, prepare ſuch Bills or Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the King to ſign, as not being mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Law are by any Warrants directed to them to prepare. In their Office, all Grants either prepared by the Kings lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Council in the Law, or by themſelves, for the Kings hand, when ſigned are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and there tranſcribed again, and that tranſcription is carried to one of the Principal Secretaries of State, and Sealed, and then it is called a Signet, which is directed to the Lord Privy Seal, and is his Warrant for iſſuing out a Privy Seal upon it, which is prepared by the Clerks of that Seal, is ſufficient for the payment of any Moneys out of the Exchequer and for ſeveral other uſes: but when the nature of the Grant requires the paſſing the Great Seal, then the Privy Seal is an Authority to the Lord Keeper to paſs the Great Seal, as the Signet was to the Lord Privy Seal to affix that Seal to the Grant, but in all three Offices, <hi>viz.</hi> Signet, Privy-Seal and Great-Seal, the Grant is tranſcribed. So all which paſſes from the King hath theſe ſeveral ways of being conſidered before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95252:19"/>There are alſo four Clarks of the Privy Seal, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord <hi>Sandwich,</hi> whoſe Intereſt for his life is in one Mr <hi>Watkins</hi>; Mr <hi>Baron,</hi> Maſter <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> and Mr. —</p>
            <p>More of their Office is to be ſeen in <hi>Stat.</hi> 27. of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. worthy to be noted.</p>
            <p>To this Office (in time when the Court of <hi>Requeſt</hi> is in being) belongs the Sealing of all Commiſſions, and other proceſs out of that Court.</p>
            <p>Moreover depending on the Secretaries of State, is an antient Office called the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Office, the Keeper whereof hath in his Charge, all the publick Papers, Writings, Matters of State, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, all Letters, Intelligences, Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Kings publick Miniſters abroad, and generally all the Papers and diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that paſs through the Offices of the two Secretaries of State, which are from time to time tranſmitted into this Office, and here remain, diſpoſed by way of a Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry within His Majeſties Palace of <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.</hi> This conſiderable Officer hath a Fee of 160 <hi>l. per annum</hi> payable out of the Exchequer, and is at preſent that very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſon <hi>Joſeph Williamſon,</hi> Doctor of Laws.</p>
            <p>After the Kings moſt Honorable Privy Council that <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> or rather that <hi>Reſort</hi> or <hi>Spring,</hi> may be conſidered the <hi>Great wheeles</hi> firſt moved by that <hi>Spring</hi> which are the Convocation for the Eccleſiaſtical Government, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Civil.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Next to the King in the Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are the Biſhops, whereof two are called <hi>Primats, Metropolitans</hi> or Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, that is chief Biſhops, the one

            </p>
            <p>By his <hi>Epiſcopal Order</hi> he may ordain <hi>Deacons</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> he may Dedicate Churches and burying places, may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Rite and Ceremony of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, without whom none of theſe things may be done.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of a Biſhop is either <hi>Ordinary</hi> or <hi>Delegated</hi>; the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> is what by the Law of the Land belongs to each Biſhop, in his own Dioceſs; the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated,</hi> is what the King is pleaſed to confer upon him, not as a Biſhop, but as he is a Subject, and a conſiderable Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Kingdom: For all Clergymen are in <hi>England</hi> (as antiently among Gods own People the <hi>Jews,</hi> and amongſt the <hi>Primitive</hi> Chriſtians, ſo ſoon as they were under Chriſtian Emperors) judged fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy divers temporal honours and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: as,</p>
            <p>Firſt, to be in the Commiſſion of the Peace, for who ſo proper to make and keep Peace as they, whoſe conſtant duty it is to preach Peace, who ſo fit as they, whoſe main buſineſs and ſtudy it is to reconcile thoſe that are at variance; and therefore ſince His Majeſties happy Reſtauration, as well as before, divers grave diſcreet Divines have been made Juſtices of Peace, and thereby not only the poor Clergy-men
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95252:21"/>
have been protected from the oppreſſion of their cauſeleſs enemies, but many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences have been compoſed without any Law-ſute, in a more Chriſtian and leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive way.</p>
            <p>Secondly to be of His Majeſties Privy Council, where frequently Caſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may ariſe, relating to State mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that will admit neither of delay nor publication, and therefore after the pattern of that excellent Chriſtian Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Great; our good Kings both before and ſince the Reformation have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways admitted ſome ſpiritual perſons to their Council Tables and Cloſet-debates.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to be employed in publick Treaties and Negotiations of Peace, and this both the Ancient and Modern practice will juſtify, that none hath been more frequently and ſuccesfully uſed in ſuch Meſſages, then the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to enjoy ſome of the great Offices of the Crown, as to be <hi>Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, Lord Treaſurer,</hi> &amp;c. And it hath been obſerved that in the late Kings Raign, when the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was <hi>Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,</hi> that Office was executed with as much diligence, faithfulneſs, dexterity, and content to the Subject, as well as to the King, as ever it had been by any of his late lay-Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>In the ordinary Jurisdicton of a Biſhop, as a Biſhop may be conſidered either the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> it ſelf, or what is inſtated in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95252:21"/>
him by the Law of the Land, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter execution of that <hi>Jurisdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> it ſelf is eſtabliſhed partly by Statute Law, as to Licence Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, Surgeons and School-Maſters to unite and conſolidiate ſmall Pariſhes, to aſſiſt the Civil Magiſtrates in the execution of ſome Statutes concerning Eccleſiaſtical affairs, to compel the payment of Tenths and Subſidies due from the Clergy to the King.</p>
            <p>Partly by Common Law, as upon the Kings Writ, to certify the Judges touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing legitimate and illegetimate Births and Marriages, to require upon the Kings Writ, the burning of an obſtinate Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, alſo to require the Kings Writ for impriſoning the Body of one that obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtands excommunicated 40 dayes.</p>
            <p>And partly by Common and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law together, as to cauſe Wills of the Deceaſed to be proved, to grant Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Goods of ſuch as dye inteſtate, to give order for the gathering and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of periſhable Goods, where none is willing to adminiſter, to cauſe Account to be given of Adminiſtrations, to collate Benefices, to grant Inſtitutions to Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices upon the Preſentations of other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, to command Induction to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to order the collecting and preſerving of the Profits of vacant Benefices for the uſe of the Succeſſors, to defend the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes and Liberties of the Church, to viſit their particular Dioceſſes once in three
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95252:22"/>
years, and therein to inquire of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Carriages, Delinquencies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Miniſters, of Church-wardens, of the reſt of the Pariſhoners, and amongſt them, eſpecially of thoſe that profeſs themſelves Phyſitians, Surgeons, School-maſters, Midwives; of Wardens of Hoſpitals, how they perform their ſeveral Duties and truſts; alſo of all others profeſſing Chriſtianity, and offending either againſt Piety, as by Blaſphemy, Idolatry, Superſtition, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, Hereſie, Errors againſt the 39 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, Schiſm, Conventicles, abſence from Divine Service, unlawful abſtinence from the Sacraments, or elſe offending againſt Juſtice, as the delaying of Legacies given to the poor or pious uſes, Dilapidations of Buildings or Goods belonging to the Church; taking of Uſury beyond the rate allowed by Statute, Simony, Perjury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by offending againſt Sobriety, as Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Inceſt, Adultery, Fornication, filthy Speech, tempting of any ones Chaſtity, Clandeſtine Marriages, as for want of thrice publiſhing the Banes, the want of Parents conſent, the want of witneſſes, which muſt be above two, or marrying in a private place, in an undue time, before Eight in the morning, and after Twelve of the Clock in the day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, for the better executing of this <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> the Law of <hi>England</hi> hath furniſhed the Biſhops with a power of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Cenſures,</hi> whereof ſome may be inflicted both upon Lay-men and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95252:22"/>
Church-men, as Suſpenſion from entring into the Church, or elſe from receiving the Sacrament, or greater Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others may be inflicted only upon <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Perſons, as Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Eccleſiaſtical Profits, Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, ſometimes <hi>ab Officio,</hi> ſometimes <hi>à Beneficio, Deprivation</hi> and <hi>Depoſition,</hi> which is ſometimes verbal, by ſentence pronounced againſt them; and ſometimes real by Degradation. Here note that of all theſe Cenſures, Excommunication is never inflicted but only for Contumacy, as when a perſon being duly ſummoned will not appear, or appearing, will not obey the Orders of the Biſhop.</p>
            <p>The ſolemn manner of making a Biſhop in <hi>England</hi> is as followeth,</p>
            <p>When any Biſhops See becomes vacant, the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> of that <hi>Cathedral</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice thereof to the King, who is Patron of all the Biſhopricks in <hi>England</hi>; and humbly requeſting that His Majeſty will give leave for them to choſe another; the King hereupon grants to the <hi>Dean,</hi> his <hi>Congè d' Eſlire,</hi> which in French (wherein it was antiently penned) ſignifies leave to elect, then the Dean ſummons a Chapter or aſſembly of the Prebendaries, who either elect, the perſon recommended by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Letters, or ſhew cauſe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Next the Election is certified to the party Elected, who doth modeſtly refuſe it the firſt and ſecond time, and if he refuſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95252:23"/>
it a third time, then that being certifyed to His Majeſty, another is recommended; when the Election is accepted by the party, it is certifyed to the King and the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of that Province, whereupon the King gives his Royal Aſſent under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>; which is exhibited to the Archbiſhop of the Province, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to confirm and conſecrate him, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Archbiſhop ſubſcribes <hi>Fiat Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> and gives Commiſſion under his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiſcopal Seal to his Vicar-General, to perform all the Acts required for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting his Confirmation.</p>
            <p>The Vicar-General then in the name of the Archbiſhop ſends forth a Citation, ſummoning all Oppoſers of the ſaid Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Perſon Elected, to appear at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time and place eſpecially aſſigned to make their objections. This is done by an Officer of the Arches uſually at <hi>Bow Church</hi> in <hi>Cheapſid London</hi> by Proclamation three times, and then affixing the ſaid Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the Church door for all people to read, the ſaid Officer returns an Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Certificate thereof to the Archbiſhop and Vicar-General. At the day and place aſſigned for the appearance of the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers the Vicar General ſits, then the Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for the ſaid Dean and Chapter, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits the Royal aſſent and the Commiſſion of the Archbiſhop; which read and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Vicar-General, the Proctor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits the Proxy from the Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then preſents the Elected Biſhop,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95252:23"/>
and returns the Citation, and deſires the Oppoſers to be publickly called three times, which being done accordingly, he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their contumacy, and for penalty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, deſires that the buſineſs may proceed, which the Vicar-General in a Schedule by him read and ſubſcribed doth order. Next the Proctor giving a ſummary Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein is deduced the whole Proceſs of Election and Conſent, deſires a time to be aſſigned to prove it, which the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car-General admits and decrees: After which the Proctor exhibits the Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, with the Elected Biſhops Aſſent, and the Certificate to the Archbiſhop, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires a term preſently to be aſſigned to hear final ſentence, which the Vicar-General decrees. Then the Proctor deſires that all Oppoſers ſhould be again called, which being thrice publickly done, and none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, nor oppoſing, they are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced contumacious, and a Decree made to proceed to Sentence, by a Schedule read and ſubſcribed by the ſaid Vicar-General. Then the Elect perſon takes the path of Supremacy, Simony, and Canonical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>Next the Judge of the Arches reads and ſubſcribes the Sentence, after which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally there is an entertainment made for the Officers and others there preſent, which being once done at the Sign of the Nags Head in <hi>Cheapſide</hi> near the ſaid <hi>Bow Church,</hi> gave occaſion to our adverſaries of the Romiſh Church, to affirm that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95252:24"/>
that there our firſt Biſhops after the Reformation were conſecrated.</p>
            <p>When a Biſhop is Elected, and the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on confirmed, he may give Inſtitution, and do his ordinary Jurisdiction, and may ſit in Parliament as a Lord thereof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Sir Ed. Coke</hi> 4. <hi>Inſtitut p.</hi> 47.</p>
            <p>After the Confirmation, then according to the Kings Mandate is the ſolemn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the Elected Biſhop, which is done by the Archbiſhop with the aſſiſtance of two: other Biſhops in manner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Upon ſome Sunday or Holy-day after Morning Service, the Archbiſhop begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Communion Service, after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Prayer appointed for this occaſion, one of the Biſhops there preſent readeth the Epiſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. another readeth the Goſpel, <hi>John</hi> 21. then after the Nicene Creed and ſome Sermon, the Elected Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop veſted with his Rochet or Linnen Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is by two Biſhops preſented to the Archbiſhop, or ſome other Biſhop commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by him, ſitting in his Chair, who demands the Kings Mandate for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, and cauſes it to be read; then the Elect Biſhop takes the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and of Canonical Obedience to the Archbiſhop; and after divers prayers and ſeveral Interrogatories put to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and his Anſwers, the reſt of the Epiſcopal Habit is put upon him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more prayers the Elect Biſhop kneeleth down, and the Archbiſhop and Biſhops
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95252:24"/>
there preſent lay their hands on his head, and by a certain pious grave form of words, they conſecrate him. Afterward the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop doth deliver to the Biſhop Elect a Bible with an other ſet form of words, and ſo all proceed to the Communion Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and having received the Sacrament, and the Bleſſing, they retire from Church to dinner, which is at the charge of the Biſhop Elect, and is uſually very ſplendid and magnificent, the greateſt the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Clergy, Judges, Privy-Counſellors, &amp;c. honouring it with their preſence, the expence hereof with Fees of Conſecration commonly amounting to Six or Seven hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>This form and manner of conſecrating Biſhops is accordingly to the rule laid down in the Fourth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> about the year 470, generally received in all the Provinces of the Weſtern Church.</p>
            <p>Note that by our Order of Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Biſhops, it is evident that Biſhops are lookt upon as a diſtinct Order of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not only as a different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree from the reſt of the Presbyters, as ſome would have it.</p>
            <p>Next goes forth a Mandate from the Archbiſhop to the Archdeacon of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, to inſtal the Biſhop Elected, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and conſecrated.</p>
            <p>Then the ſaid Biſhop is introduced into the Kings preſence, to do his Homage for his Temporalties or Barony, by kneeling down and putting his hands between the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95252:25"/>
hands of the King ſitting in a Chair of State, and by taking of a ſolemn Oath to be true and faithful to His Majeſty, and that he holds his Temporalties of him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the new Biſhop compounds for the firſt Fruits of his Biſhoprick, that is, agrees for his firſt years profits to be paid to the King, within two years or more if the King pleaſe.</p>
            <p>The Tranſlation of a Biſhop from one Biſhoprick to another differs onely in this, from the manner of making a Biſhop, that there is no Conſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>c<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation.</p>
            <p>The Tranſlation of a Biſhop to be Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop differs only in the Commiſſion which is directed by His Majeſty to four or more Biſhops to confirm him. Note that the difference between an Archbiſhop and a Biſhop, is that the Archbiſhop with other Biſhops doth conſecrate a Biſhop, as a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop with other Prieſts doth ordain a Prieſt: The Archbiſhop viſits the whole Province, the Biſhop only his Dioceſs; The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop can convocate a Provincial Synod, the Biſhop only a Dioceſan Synod; The Archbiſhop is Ordinary to; and hath Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Authority over all the Biſhops of his Province, as the Biſhop hath over all the Prieſts of his Dioceſs.</p>
            <p>Several Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> having Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes of a large extent, it was provided by <hi>Stat.</hi> 26 <hi>Henry</hi> 8. that they ſhould have a power to nominate ſome to the King to be with his approbation Suffragan or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidiary Biſhops, whereof ſee more in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95252:25"/>
firſt Part of the <hi>Preſent State of England.</hi> Of theſe there are none at preſent in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but the next to the Biſhops are now the Deans of Cathedral Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Dean &amp; Chapter.</note>Antiently Biſhops did not ordinarily tranſact matters of moment <hi>ſine conſilio Presbyterorum principalium,</hi> who were then called <hi>Senatores Eccleſiae,</hi> and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues of the Biſhops, repreſented in ſome ſort by our Cathedrals, whereof the Dean and ſome of the Prebends are upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſummons to aſſiſt him in Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in Deprivations <hi>ab Officio &amp; Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi> in condemnation of obſtinate Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, in the greater Excommunications, and in ſuch like weighty affairs of the Church. Upon the Kings Writ of <hi>Congè d' Eſlire</hi> (as before mentioned) the Dean and Prebendaries are to elect the Biſhop of that Dioceſs. Cathedral and Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate Churches are as it were Seminaries or Seed-plots, whereout from time to time may be choſen fit perſons to govern the Church, for having left the Country, and living herein a Society together, they learn experience, they read men, they by little and little put off the familiarity of the inferiour Countrey Clergy, and thereby render themſelves the more fit to be ſet over them in Government. The Dean and Prebendaries, during their required reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their Cathedral or Collegiate Churches are to keep Hoſpitallity, upon all Feſtivals to read Divinity in their turns,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95252:26"/>
which is now turned to Sermons, or ſet ſpeeches in the Pulpit; at due time to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Lords Supper; to frequent the Publick Divine Service, to inſtruct the Country Clergy, and direct them how and what to preach, whereby they may beſt profit their Auditors: In a word, as they excel others in dignity, and are therefore ſtiled Prelats, ſo by their more eminent piety and charity, they are to be exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and paterns to the inferiour Clergy.</p>
            <p>In every Cathedral or Biſhops See there is a Dean and divers Prebendaries or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, whoſe number is uncertain.</p>
            <p>Deans of the old Foundations, founded before the ſuppreſſion of Monaſteris, are brought to their Dignities much like Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, the King firſt ſending forth his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gè d' eſlire</hi> to the Chapter, they electing, and the King granting his Royal aſſent; the Biſhop confirms him, and gives his Mandate to inſtall him.</p>
            <p>Deans of the new Foundations (upon ſuppreſſion of Abbyes or Prinries tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by <hi>Henry</hi> 8. in to Dean and Chapter) are by a ſhorter courſe inſtalled by virtue of the Kings Letters Patents, without either Election or Confirmation.</p>
            <p>Among the Canons or Prebendaries in the old Foundations, ſome are <hi>Canonici actu,</hi> having <hi>Prebendam ſedile in Choro &amp; jus ſuffragii in Capitulo</hi>; others are <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonici in herbis</hi> (as they are called) having right to the next Prebend that ſhall become void and having already a Stall in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95252:26"/>
Quire, but no Vote in the Chapter.</p>
            <p>A Prebend is properly the portion which every Prebendary of a Cathedral or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate Church receiveth in the right of his place for his maintenance <hi>quaſi pars vel portio prebenda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next in the Government of the Engliſh Church may be reckoned Archdeacons, whereof there are 60 in all <hi>England</hi>; Their Office is to viſit two years in three, and to enquire of Reparations and Moveables belonging to Churches, to reform abuſes, in Eccleſiaſtical matters, and to bring the more weighty affairs before the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Many Archdeacons have by Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their Courts and Officials as Biſhops have, whereof more hereafter.</p>
            <p>After Archdeacons are the <hi>Archipresby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri</hi> or Rural Deans, ſo called perhaps at firſt for his overſight of ſome Ten Pariſh Prieſts; their Office is now upon orders to convocate the Clergy, to ſignifie to them ſometimes by Letters the Biſhops pleaſure, and to give induction for the Archdeacon living afar off.</p>
            <p>Next are to be conſidered the Prieſts of every particular Pariſh, who are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95252:27"/>
called the Rectors, unleſs the predial Tythes are impropriated, and then they are ſtiled Vicars, <hi>quaſi vice fungentes Rectorum.</hi> Their Office is to take care of all their Pariſhioners Souls, and like good Shepherds, to handle every particular Sheep apart; to Catechiſe the ignorant, reduce the ſtraying, confirm the wavering, convince the obſtinate, reprehend the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, confute Schiſmaticks, reconcile diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences amongſt Neighbours, to exerciſe the power of binding and looſing of ſouls as occaſion ſhall offer, to read duly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, to Adminiſter the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, to viſit the Sick, to Marry, to Bury, to render publick thanks after Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, to keep a Regiſter of all Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Chriſtnings and Burials that ſhall happen within the Pariſh, to read the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sermons or Homilies appointed by Authority (and if the Biſhop think fit) to read or ſpeak by heart their own concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>Laſtly Deacons, whoſe Office is to take care of the Poor, Baptiſe, Read in the Church, aſſiſt the Prieſt at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by giving the Cup only.</p>
            <p>After this brief account of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſons, ſomewhat may here not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly be added touching thoſe perſons who though not in holy Orders, yet have a peculiar Relation to the Church, and are <hi>quaſi ſemi Eccleſiaſtici,</hi> as firſt Patrons of Churches, who by firſt building of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or firſt endowing them with Lands, have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95252:27"/>
obtained for them and their Heirs a right of Advowſon or Patronage, whoſe office and duty is to preſent a fit Clerk (when the Church is void) to the Biſhop to be by him Canonically inſtituted, and to protect the ſaid Church as far as he can from all wrong, and in caſe his Clerk prove unfit for the place, to give notice thereof to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
            <p>Next are the <hi>Oeconomi vel Eccleſiae Guardiani,</hi> the Church wardens, whoſe Office is to ſee that the Church be in good repair, fitly adorned, and nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Divine Service, Sacrament, and Sermons; that the Church yard be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently mounded or incloſed, that there be an exact Terrier of the Glebe Lands, and if any thing belonging to the Church be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, to ſue for the ſame; to obſerve that all Pariſhoners come duly to Divine Service, to require the penalty for abſence, to enquire after, to admoniſh and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Biſhop ſcandalous livers, to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Charity of the Pariſhoners for poor Strangers, to declare and to execute the orders of the Biſhop, to ſee that none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to vent his own conceptions in the Pulpit, unleſs he hath a ſpecial licence ſo to do. The Churchwardens are elected every Eaſter Week, uſually by the Parſon and Pariſhoners if they ſo agree; if not, then one by the Parſon, and the other by the Pariſhioners.</p>
            <p>There are alſo in greater Pariſhes joyned with the Church wardens <hi>Teſtes Synodales,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:95252:28"/>
anciently called Synods-men, now cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly called Sides-men, who are to aſſiſt the Church-wardens, in enquiries into the lives of inordinate livers, and in preſenting men at Viſitations.</p>
            <p>Laſtly the Sacriſtan, corruptly the Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton or Clark, who is ordinarily to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the Parſon only: he ought to be twenty years old or above, of good life, that can read, write, and ſing: his office is to ſerve at Church the Prieſt and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens.</p>
            <p>In the Church of <hi>England</hi> there are, as in the antient primitive times, three Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons. None may be admitted Deacon before the age of 23 years, unleſs he hath a Diſpenſation to be admitted younger: None may be made a Prieſt till he be completely 24 years old. None may be admitted Biſhop till full 30 years old.</p>
            <p>The Ordination of Prieſts and Deacons is four times the year, upon four ſeveral Sundayes in the Ember or Failing Weeks, that ſo all the Nation may at once in their joynt Prayers to God, recommend them that are to receive Ordination, which is performed by a Biſhop, in a ſolemn grave devout manner thus for Deacons. After Morning Prayer there is a Sermon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the Duty and Office of Deacons and Prieſts; then they being decently ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, are preſented to the Biſhop by the Archdeacon or his Deputy, whom the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop askes if he hath, made due inquiry
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95252:28"/>
of them, and then askes the people if they know any notable impediment or crime in any one of them; after follow certain godly Prayers, then a Collect, Epiſtle and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: but before the Goſpel the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy is adminiſtred to every one of them, and the Biſhop putteth divers god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly queſtions to them, which being anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they all kneel and he laying his hands upon them ſeverally doth ordain them Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons; then delivers to every one of them the New Teſtament, and gives them au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to read the ſame in the Church; then one of them appointed by the Biſhop reads the Goſpel, and then all with the Biſhop proceed to the Communion, and ſo are diſmiſſed with the Bleſſing pronounced by the Biſhop.</p>
            <p>The Ordination of Prieſts is partly in the ſame manner, only the Epiſtle and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are different; and after the queſtions and anſwers made, the Biſhop puts up a particular prayer for them, and that ended, he deſires the Congregation to recommend them to God ſecretly in their prayers for doing of which there is a competent time of general ſilence, then follows <hi>Vent Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator Spiritus</hi> in Meter to be ſung, then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another prayer, they all kneeling, the Biſhop, with the Prieſts preſent, layeth his hands upon the head of every one ſeverally, and gives them Ordination in a grave ſet form of words, different both from that of Biſhops and that of Deacons, the reſt as in the ordaining of Deacons,</p>

               <p>FOr the Church legiſlative power, or the making of Eccleſiaſtical Laws, and conſulting of the more weighty affairs of the Church, the King by the adviſe of his Privy Council, uſually convokes a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Synod commonly called the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is ſummoned in manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>The King directeth his Writ to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops of each Province, for ſummoning all Biſhops, Deans, Arch-deacons, Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals, and Collegiate Churches, according to their beſt diſcretion and judgment, aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the time and place in the ſaid Writ; whereupon the Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> directs his Letters to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> as his Dean Provincial, firſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf peremptorily, and then wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to cite in like manner all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Deans, Archdeacons, Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, and all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of his Province to that place, and at the day prefixt in the Writ; but directeth withal that one Proctor ſent for each Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral and Collegiate Churche, and two for the body of the inferiour Clergy of each Dioceſs may ſuffice. The Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> accordingly directs his letters to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95252:29"/>
the Biſhops of every Dioceſs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, citing them in like manner to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and to admoniſh the Deans and Archdeacons to appear perſonally, and the Cathedrals, Collegiate Churches and inferiour Clergy of the Dioceſs, to ſend their Proctors to the place; and at the day appointed; alſo to certifie to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop the names of all ſo ſummoned by them.</p>
               <p>The place where the Convocation of Clergy in the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath uſually been held, was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church in <hi>London,</hi> but of later times at St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the Chappel of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Seventh; where there is (as in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament) a Higher and a Lower Houſe, or a Houſe of Lords Spiritual, and a Houſe of Commons Spiritual.</p>
               <p>The Higher Houſe of Convocation in the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> conſiſts of 22 Biſhops, whereof the Archbiſhop is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, ſittting in a Chair at the upper end of a great Table, and the Biſhops on each ſide of the ſame Table all in their Scarlet Robes.</p>
               <p>The Lower Houſe conſiſts of all the Deans, Archdeacons, one Proctor for every Chapter, and two Proctors for all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of each Dioceſs, in all 166 perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> 22 Deans, 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prebendaries, 54 Archdeacons, and 44 Clerks repreſenting the Dioceſan-Clergy.</p>

and the Lower being required by the Highe Houſe to chooſe them a Prolocutor, or Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; which done they preſent him to the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Houſe by two of their Members, whereof one makes a Speech in Latin; and then the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect perſon makes another Speech in Latin. Laſtly the Archbiſhop anſwers in Latin, and in the name of all the Lords approves of the perſon.</p>
               <p>Both Houſes debate and tranſact only ſuch matters as His Majeſty by Commiſſion expreſly alloweth.</p>
               <p>In the Upper Houſe things are firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and then communicated to the Lower Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Major vote in each Houſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes.</p>
               <p>Out of Parliament time they uſually aſſemble every day about Nine of the clock, and firſt the Junior Biſhop ſayes prayers in Latin, beginning with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, and then for the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the Lower Houſe the Prolocutor ſays prayers.</p>
               <p>In Convocation are debated only matters concerning Religion and the Church, and ſometime of giving His Majeſty aſſiſtance in Money; for as the Laity cannot be tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without their own conſent, ſignified by their Repreſentative in Parliament, ſo the Clergy cannot be taxed without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſignified by their Repreſentative in Convocation.</p>
               <p>The Clergy in Convocation might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently without asking the Royal Aſſent, and now may with the Royal Aſſent make

Canons touching matters of Religion, to bind not only themſelves, but all the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with-out conſent or ratification of the Lords and Commons in Parliament.</p>
               <p>Till the late Rebellion the Parliament did not at all meddle in the making Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, or in matters Doctrinal, or in Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Scriptures, only by their civil Sanctions (when they were thereto requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) did confirm the Reſults and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations of the Clergy, that ſo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might be the more eaſily induced to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Ordinances of their Spiritual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.</p>
               <p>The Clergy of <hi>England</hi> had antiently their Repreſentatives in the Lower Houſe of Parliament, as appears by that antient Record ſo highly prized by the late Lord <hi>Coke</hi>; and as the Upper Houſe had and ſtill hath Lords Spiritual as well as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral; ſo in the Lower Houſe there were always Commons Spiritual as well as Temporal; for that Record ſaith expreſly, that the Commons in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament conſiſt of three degrees or kinds; Firſt, <hi>ex Procuratoribus Cleri</hi>; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>ex Militibus Comitatuum</hi>; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>ex Burgenſibus</hi>: and the words of the Writ directed now to the <hi>Procuratores Cleri,</hi> ſeem to give them the very ſame right to ſit in that Houſe, as the words of the Writ to the Knights, Citizens and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes do give to them.</p>
               <p>All the Members of both Houſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation have the ſame priviledges for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95252:31"/>

               <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> at the ſame time holds at <hi>York</hi> a Convocation of all his Province in like manner, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant correſpondence doth debate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of the ſame matters as are debated and concluded by the Provincial Synod of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the Executive power in Church matters throughout the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there have been provided divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Courts, whereof the higheſt for cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Cauſes was the High Commiſſion Court, for the juriſdiction whereof it was enacted <hi>primo Elizabethae,</hi> that Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Succeſſors ſhould have power by Letters Patents under the Great Seal, to nominate Commiſſioners to exerciſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction throughout the whole Realm; to viſit, reform, and correct all Errors, Hereſies, Schiſms, Abuſes, and Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencies, that may by any Eccleſiaſtical power be corrected or reformed.</p>
               <p>This Court conſiſted of the higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>England</hi> in the Church and State, and was the principal Bulwark and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative of the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt the practices and aſſaults of all her Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, whether Romaniſt, Puritan, or Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, yet for ſome pretended abuſes, the uſe thereof was taken away in the late ſeditious long Parliament; whereupon followed a deluge of Errors in Religion, Apoſtacy,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95252:31"/>
Atheiſm, Blaſphemy, Sacriledge, Inceſt, Adultery, impious Libels, Schiſms, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which ſo overwhelmed the manners of Engliſh men, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned at length ſo many profeſt Atheiſts, that until the re-eſtabliſhment of this or the like Court, there cannot a Reformation be reaſonably hoped for.</p>
               <p>For civil affairs that concern the Church, the higheſt Court is the Court of Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates for the juriſdiction whereof it was provided 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. that it ſhall be lawful for any ſubject of <hi>England,</hi> in caſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of juſtice in the Courts of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to appeal to the Kings Majeſty in his Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> and that upon ſuch appeal, a Commiſſion under the Great Seal ſhall be directed to certain perſons particularly deſigned for that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo that from the higheſt Court of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> there lies an Appeal to this Court of Delegates, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this to none other.</p>
               <p>Next to the Court of Delegates are the Courts of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where any Eccleſiaſtical Sutes between any perſons may (waving all inferior Courts) be decided; amongſt them the higheſt Court is the Court of Arches, ſo called from the Arched Church and Tower of <hi>S. Maries</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide, London,</hi> where this Court is wont to be held, the Judge whereof is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Dean of the Arches, having juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over a Deanery, conſiſting of 13 Pariſhes within <hi>London,</hi> exempt from the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95252:32"/>
of the Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> Hither are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected all Appeals in Eccleſiaſtical matters within the Province of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> To this Court belongs divers Advocates, all Doctors of the Civil Law, two Regiſters, and ten Proctors: the Dean at preſent is Doctor <hi>Sweat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath his Court of Audience kept within the Archbiſhops Palace, and medleth not with any difference between parties, but concerning Elections and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of Biſhops, Admiſſion and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to Benefices, dipenſing with Banes of Matrimony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Court is called the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Court, which judgeth of Eſtates fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len by Will, or by Inteſtates, ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Archbiſhops <hi>jure Praerogativae ſuae</hi> hath this power throughout his whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince where the party at the time of death had 5 <hi>l.</hi> or above in ſeveral Dioceſes; and theſe two Courts hath alſo the Archbiſhop of <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Court of Peculiars, which dealeth in certain Pariſhes, lying in ſeveral Dioceſes, which Pariſhes are exempt from the juriſdiction of the Biſhops of thoſe Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes, and are peculiarly belonging to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince there are 57 ſuch Peculiars.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Courts ſerving for the whole Province, every Biſhop hath his Court held in the Cathedral of his Dioceſs, over which he hath a Chancellor, tearmed anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95252:32"/>
                  <hi>Eccleſiecdicus &amp; Epiſcopi Ecdicus,</hi> the Church Lawyer or the Biſhops Lawyer, who being skill'd in the Civil and Canon Law, ſits there as Judge; and if his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs be large, he hath in ſome more remote place a Commiſſary, whoſe authority is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome certain place of the Dioceſs, and ſome certain Cauſes limited to him by the Biſhop in his Commiſſion; and theſe are called Conſiſtory Courts.</p>
               <p>Moreover, every Archdeacon hath his Court and Juriſdiction, where ſmaller differences ariſing within his limits are pleaded. Alſo the Dean and Chapter hath a Court, and take cognizance of Cauſes happening in places belonging to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there are certain peculiar Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions belonging to ſome certain Pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the Inhabitants whereof are exempt ſometimes from the Archdeacons Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſometimes from the Biſhops Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>Cauſes belonging to Eccleſiaſtical Courts, are Blaſphemy, Apoſtaſie from Chriſtianity, Hereſies, Schiſms, Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Inſtitutions of Clerks to Benefices, Celebration of Divine Service, Rights of Matrimony, Divorces, general Baſtardy, Tythes, Oblations, Obventions, Mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, Dilapidations, Reparation of Churches, Probate of Wills, Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Simony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inceſts, Fornications, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, Solicitations of Chaſtity, Penſions, Procurations, Commutation of Pennance,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95252:33"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the cognizance whereof belongs not to the Common Law of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Laws and Conſtitutions whereby the Eccleſiaſtical Government doth ſtand, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> is governed, are firſt general Canons made by general Councels; alſo the <hi>Arbitria ſanctorum Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum,</hi> the opinion of Fathers, the grave Decrees of ſeveral Holy Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> from time to time have admitted.</p>
               <p>Next our own Conſtitutions made anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in ſeveral Provincial Synods, either by the Legats <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Othobon,</hi> ſent from <hi>Rome</hi>; or by ſeveral Archbiſhops of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>; all which are by 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of force in <hi>England,</hi> ſo far as they are not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>England,</hi> or the Kings Prerogative. Then the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons made in Convocations of later times, as <hi>primo Jacobi,</hi> and confirmed by his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Authority. Alſo ſome Statutes enacted by Parliament touching Eccleſiaſtical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: And laſtly, divers Cuſtoms not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but yet in uſe beyond the memory of man: and where theſe fail, the Civil Law takes place.</p>
               <p>The manner of Tryals by theſe Laws and Cuſtoms are different from the Tryals at Common Law, and are briefly thus. Firſt goes forth a Citation, then Bill and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, then by Proofs, Witneſſes, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions the matter is argued <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> and the Canon and Civil Laws quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then without any Jury, the definitive
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95252:33"/>
ſentence of the Judge paſſſeth, and upon that Execution. And this is the manner of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eccleſiaſtical Civil Cauſes; but Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical criminal Cauſes are tryed by way of Accuſation, Denunciation, or Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The firſt, when ſome one takes upon him to prove the crime: the ſecond, when the Churchwardens preſent and are nor bound to prove, becauſe it is preſumed they do it without any malice, and that the crime is notorious. Laſtly, by Inquiſition, when by reaſon of common fame, inquiry is made by the Biſhop, <hi>ex officio ſuo,</hi> by calling ſome of the neighborhood to their Oaths, or the party accuſed to his Oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> ſo called, becauſe the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Judge doth it <hi>ex officio ſuo,</hi> which is very antient, and was uſual among the Jews; ſo <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Acan, Fili mi tribue gloriam, &amp;c.</hi> So God himſelf to <hi>Adam</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his firſt tranſgreſſion; and likewiſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>Sodom</hi>; but by the prevailing faction in the long Parliament, this power was extorted from the Church, the want whereof is one main cauſe of the great libertiniſme and debauchery of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Now the puniſhments inflicted by theſe Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical Courts, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical Laws, proceed in this manner.

And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church of <hi>England</hi> proceedeth no otherwiſe than the State of <hi>England</hi>; for ſo odious in the eye of the common Law of <hi>Enland,</hi> is the contempt thereof, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Felonies, but even in an Action of the caſe, in an Action of a ſmall Debt, Account or Detinue, if a man will not appear and ſubmit himſelf to a Tryal at Law, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Outlawry is grounded againſt him, and he being once Outlawed, he is out of the protection of the Law. <hi>Caput gerit lupinum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bracton,</hi> an Outlaw'd was antiently lookt upon as a Wolf, lawfully to be killed by any man that ſhould meet him, as moſt juſt, that he who contemned the Law, and therein the King, ſhould not have benefit by the Law, nor protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the King, and at this day he is to

looſe all his Goods and Chattels. The Reader will eaſily pardon this digreſſion when he conſiders the general cry againſt Excommunications at this day.</p>
               <p>This power of leſſer Excommunication the Biſhop may delegate to any grave Prieſt with the Chancellour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Excommunicato major</hi> is not only an excluſion from the company of Chriſtians in Spiritual Duties, but alſo in Temporal affairs, and this commonly for Hereſie, Schiſm, Perjury, Inceſt, and ſuch grievous crimes; and that it may be done with the more ſolemnity and terror, it is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Biſhop himſelf in his proper perſon; and being ſo Excommunicated, a man cannot in any Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Court, be Plaintiff or Witneſs. And in caſe any man be ſo ſtubborn as to continue 40 days excommunicated, the Kings Writ <hi>de excommunicato capiendo</hi> is granted forth of the Chancery againſt him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he is caſt into priſon without Bail, there to lie till he hath ſatisfied for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>Next there is <hi>Anathematiſmus</hi> to be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only upon an obſtinate Heretick, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is declared a publick Enemy of God, and rejected, and curſed, and delivered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to eternal damnation: and this to be done by the Biſhop, alſo in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, aſſiſted by the Dean and Chapter, or twelve other grave Prieſts.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there is <hi>Interdictum,</hi> whereby is prohibited all Divine Offices, as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95252:35"/>
an Burial, Adminiſtration of Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in ſuch a Place, or to ſuch a People, and if this be againſt a People; it follows them whereſoever they go; but if againſt a Place only, then the People of that Place may go to Divine Offices elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe general cenſures of the Church, which reſpect Church Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is another which toucheth the body of the Delinquent, called Publick Penance, when any one is compelled to confeſs in publick his fault, and to bewail it before the whole Congregation in the Church; which is done in this manner: the Delinquent is to ſtand in the Church Porch upon ſome Sunday bare, head and feet, in a white Sheet, and a white Rod in his Hand, there bewailing himſelf, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one that paſſes by to pray for him; then to enter the Church, falling down and kiſſing the ground; then in the middle of the Church, placed in a higher place in the ſight of all the People, and over againſt the Miniſter, who declares the foulneſs of his crime odious to God, and ſcandalous, to the Congregation, that God can no way be ſatisfied but by applying Chriſts ſufferings, nor the Congregation, but by an humble acknowledging of his ſin, and teſtifying his ſincere repentance and ſorrow, not in words only, but with tears, and promiſing there in the ſight of God and his Holy Angels, that by Gods aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and by Prayer, Meditation, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly works of Piety, he will endeavor hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95252:35"/>
more carefully to watch againſt the temptations of the world, the allurements of the fleſh, and the ſnares of the Devil: which being done, and the Prieſt in Chriſts name pronouncing the remiſſion of ſins, the penitent humbly beſeeches the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to pardon him that great ſcandal againſt them, and receive him into their holy Communion, and to account him again a Member of their Church and in teſtimony hereof, out of their Chriſtian Charity, to vouchſafe to ſay with him aloud, the Lords Prayer. And this way of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> appears by divers Writers, to be the antient way uſed by the Primitive Churches:</p>
               <p>Note that it is ordained by the Canons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that in caſe the crime be not notorious and publick, the forenamed penance may at the parties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt be commuted into a pecuniary Mulct for the poor of the Pariſh, or ſome Pious uſes, provided that for the Reformation of the Delinquent that way appear to be the more probable way; for ſome men will be thereby reclaimed, who by publication of their offence would become more impudent, and hardned, when they perceive their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to be loſt.</p>
               <p>There remains one more puniſhment or Eccleſiaſtical cenſure which toucheth the body, and that is denyal of Chriſtian bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, which is inflicted not in <hi>poenam mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuorum,</hi> but in <hi>terrorem viventium,</hi> who naturally deſire that after their death their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95252:36"/>
bodies may be decently interred. And Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian burial is wont to be denyed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to perſons dying ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, to perjured perſons, to ſuch as are hanged for Felony, or that wilfully kill themſelves, and to Apoſtates, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and Extortioners.</p>
               <p>To theſe forenamed Cenſures and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, both Laity and Clergy are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but beſides theſe, there are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereunto the Clergy only are lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as firſt, <hi>Suſpenſio ab Officio,</hi> when a Miniſter for a time is declared unfit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the Office of a Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Suſpenſio a Beneficio,</hi> when a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for a time is deprived of the profits of his Benefice; and theſe two Cenſures are wont to be for ſmaller crimes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Deprivatio a Beneficio,</hi> when for a greater crime, a Miniſter is wholly and for ever deprived of his Living.</p>
               <p>And fourthly, <hi>Deprivatio ab Officio,</hi> when a Miniſter is wholly and for ever deprived of his Orders, and this is called <hi>Depoſitio,</hi> or <hi>Degradatio,</hi> and is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſome heynous crime, meriting death, and is performed by the Biſhop in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner, pulling off from the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal his Veſtments, and other Enſignes of his Order; and this in the preſence of the Civil Magiſtrate, to whom he is then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to be puniſhed as a Lay man for the like offence.

               </p>

The Commons alſo were called to ſit in Parliament; for the firſt Writs ſent forth to ſummon them, bears date 49. <hi>H.</hi> 3. about 400 years agoe.</p>
               <p>None but the King hath authority to ſummon a Parliament: In the Kings ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence out of the Realm, the <hi>Cuſtos Regni</hi> in the Kings name doth ſummon a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and during the Kings minority within the Realm, the <hi>Protector Regni</hi> doth the ſame.</p>
               <p>No Parliament can begin without the Kings Preſence, either in Perſon, or by Repreſentation by <hi>Commiſſioners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the King of <hi>England</hi> is with his Parliament in time of peace, he is then ſaid to be in the height of his Royal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as well as when he is at the head of his Army in time of War. There is then ſcarce any thing that the King cannot do, his power cannot be confined for Cauſes or Perſons within any bounds.

the four Seas. He can make an Infant of full age, make an Alien or Forreigner an Engliſhman, can attaint a man of Treaſon when he is dead, when he is no more a man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Parliament is ſummoned in manner following; About 40 days before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament doth aſſemble, the King iſſues out his Writ <hi>cum Adviſamento Concilii ſui,</hi> and the Warrant is, <hi>per ipſum Regem &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kings Writ (which is a ſhort Letter or Epiſtle) is directed and ſent to every particular perſon of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, commanding the Lords Spiritual <hi>in Fide &amp; Dilectione,</hi> and the Lords Temporal, <hi>per Fidem &amp; Allegian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> to appear at a certain time and place, to Treat and give their Advice in ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain important affairs concerning the Church and State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other Writs are ſent to the High Sheriff of each County, to ſummon the people to elect two Knights for each County, two Citizens for each City, and one or two Burgeſſes for each Burrough, according to <hi>Statute, Charter</hi> or <hi>Cuſtoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe Elections, antiently, all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had their Votes, and moſt Votes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it; but for avoiding of tumults and trouble, it was enacted by <hi>H.</hi> VI. that none ſhould have any ſuffrage in the election of Knights of the Shire, but ſuch as were Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, did reſide in the County, and had yearly Revenue 40 <hi>s.</hi> (which till the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

               <p>Two things are ſaid to be requiſite to the legality of ſitting in Parliament; firſt, that a man ſhould be of full age, that is, 21 years old at the leaſt; for if no man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that age can diſpoſe of his Eſtate, nor
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95252:38"/>
make one legal Act to that purpoſe, then much leſs may he bear any part in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power of the Nation, to Judge, Vote, or Diſpoſe of the Eſtate of the whole Realm: yet the practice in the Houſe of Commons (though never in the Houſe of Lords) hath ſometimes been otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>All Members of Parliament, both Lords and Commons, that they may attend the publick Service of their Countrey, are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged with their menial Servants attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their perſons, together with all their neceſſary Goods, brought along with them from all Attachments and Impriſonments, for Debts, Treſpaſſes, Account or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, all the time that they are on the way to the place of Parliament, all the time they are at Parliament, and all the time they are on the way home again, <hi>Eundo, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando, ad propria redeundo</hi> (for ſo were the old words) but they are not priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Arreſts for Treaſon, Felony, or breach of the peace.</p>
               <p>The place of meeting for the High and Honourable Aſſembly, is in whatſoever City, Town, or Houſe the King pleaſeth, but of latter times it hath been uſually held at the Kings antient Palace, and uſual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> all the Lords in a fair Room by themſelves, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons not far from them in another fair Room, which was heretofore the antient free Chappel of <hi>S.

                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:95252:39"/>The King as oft as he comes (which hath uſually been, only at the opening of Parliaments, or at the paſſing of Bills, or at ſome ſolemn debates, as the preſent King hath frequently done) is placed at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the room in a Chair of State, under a Cloth of State, under which on either hand none but the Kings Children.</p>
               <p>On the Kings right hand is a ſeat, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when he was ſummoned to Parliament, as he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was <hi>in ſide &amp; legiantia</hi>; but now it is for the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> On the Kings left hand is a Seat for the Duke of <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the Kings right hand and next the wall, are placed on a Form the two Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, next below on another Form, the Biſhops of <hi>London, Durham,</hi> and <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>; all the reſt of the Biſhops ſit accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the priority of their Conſecration.</p>
               <p>On the Kings left hand upon Forms, are placed the Lords Chancellor, Treaſurer, Preſident of the Kings Council, and Lord Privy Seal; if they are Barons, above all Dukes, except thoſe of the Royal Family; if they are not Barons, then they ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt on the Woolſacks.</p>

The reaſon why theſe Sages are placed upon Woolſacks, may probably be to mind them of the great importance of Wooll and Sheep to the Nation, that it-never be neglected.</p>
               <p>On the lowermoſt Woolſack are placed the Clerk of the Crown, now <hi>Henry Barker</hi> Eſquire, and Clerk of the Parliament at preſent <hi>John Brown</hi> Eſquire; whereof the former is concerned in all Writs of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Pardons in Parliament; the other recordeth all things done in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and keepeth the Records of the ſame.

Without the Bar of the Lords Houſe ſits the Kings firſt Gentleman Uſher called the Black Rod, from a black ſttaff he carries in his hand, under whom is a Yeoman Uſher that waits at the door within, a Cryer without, and a Sergeant at Mace always attending the Lord Keeper.</p>

               <p>The Judges ſtand till the King gives them leave to ſit.</p>
               <p>When the King is abſent, the Lords at their entrance do reverence to the Chair of State, as is or ſhould be done by all that enter into the Kings Preſence-Chamber.</p>
               <p>The Judges then may ſit, but may not be covered till the Chancellor or Keeper ſignify unto them the leave of the Lords.</p>
               <p>The Kings Council and Maſters of <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> ſit alſo, but may not be covered at all.</p>
               <p>The Commons in their Houſe ſit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, onely the Speaker hath a Chair placed in the middle, and the Clerk of that Houſe near him at the Table. They never had any Robes (as the Lords ever had) but wear every one what he fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt, which to ſtrangers ſeems very unbecoming the Gravity and Authority of the Great Council of <hi>England</hi>: and that during their attendance on Parliament, a Robe or grave veſtment would as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Honourable Members of the Houſe of Commons, as it doth all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Venetians both young and old, who have right to ſit in the Great Council of <hi>Venice,</hi> and as it doth the Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The time of ſitting in Parliament, is on any day in the morning, or afore dinner, onely it hath antienly been obſerved, not to aſſemble upon ſome high Feſtival days, but upon ordinary Sundays oft-times as days accounted by all Chriſtians leſs

               <p>The Lords Houſe hath a power not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in making and repealing Laws, but alſo <hi>in tractando &amp; conſilium impendendo,</hi> as the words of the Writ are, alſo in judging of Controverſies, judging in the arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Peer of the Realm, putting men to their Oaths, eſpecially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of importance, as the Corruption of Judges and Magiſtrates, in Errours, Illegal proceedings in other Courts, in Appeals from Decrees in Chancery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords that in their Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> may yet ſit and have Suffrage in the Lords Houſe.</p>
               <p>All the Lords Spiritual and Temporal have this Priviledge, That if by reaſon of Sickneſs, or other buſineſs they cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95252:41"/>
they may make Proxies to vote in their ſtead, after Licence obtained by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the Kings Signet, to be excuſed for their abſence: ſo that in every Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, every perſon in <hi>England,</hi> either by himſelf, Proxy, or Repreſentative is ſaid to be there, and to have his Suffrage for making or repealing any Law.</p>
               <p>The Commons have alſo a power in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and repealing Laws, they alſo have their Negative Voyce, for Levying of any money upon the Subject, the Bill is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in the Commons Houſe, becauſe from them doth ariſe the greater part of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.</p>
               <p>The Commons have the Priviledge to ſupplicate and propoſe Laws, to impeach publick Delinquents, even the higheſt Lords of the Kingdom, both Spiritual and Temporal.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of Commons is the Grand Inqueſt of the Realm, ſummoned from all parts to preſent publick grievances, and Delinquents to the King and Lords to be redreſſed and puniſhed by them; and to this purpoſe, the Lords ſit in their Robes on the Bench covered, as Judges do in other Judicatories; they ſwear and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Witneſſes, and at length paſs ſentence, whilſt the Members of the Commons Houſe ſtand bare at the Bar of the Lords Houſe, produce Witneſſes, mannage evidence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note that although every Member of the Commons Houſe is choſen to ſerve for one particular County, City, or Burrough,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95252:42"/>
yet he ſerves for the whole Kingdom, and his voyce equal to any other, his power abſolute to conſent or diſſent without ever acquainting thoſe that ſent him, or deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their aſſent, as the States General of the <hi>United Neatherlands</hi> are obliged to do in many Caſes.</p>
               <p>Yet are they to make that their ſpecial care to promote the Good of that County, City or Borough for which they ſerve.</p>
               <p>Although the Lords of Parliament are to bear their own charges, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent there only themſelves; yet all the Commons, both Lay and Clergy, that is, the <hi>Procuratores Cleri,</hi> are to have <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabiles Expenſas</hi> (as the words of the Writ are) that is, ſuch allowance as the King conſidering the Prices of all things, ſhall judge meet to impoſe upon the people to pay. In the 17 <hi>Edward</hi> 2. it was 10 <hi>groats</hi> for Knights, and 5 <hi>groats</hi> for Burgeſſes, but not long after it was 4 <hi>s.</hi> a day for dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Knights, and 2 <hi>s.</hi> for all others; which in thoſe days, as appears by the prices of all things, was a conſiderable ſum, above 20 times more than it is now, for not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their expences were conſidered, though that was great, by reaſon of the ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attendance that then every Parliament man had, but alſo their pains, their loſs of time, and neceſſary neglect of their own private affairs for the ſervice of their Country; and when the Countries, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Burroughs, paid ſo dear for their expences, they were wont to take care
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95252:42"/>
to chooſe ſuch men as were beſt able and moſt diligent in the ſpeedy diſpatch of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, by which means with ſome other, more buſineſs in thoſe times was diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliament in a week, then is now perhaps in ten: ſo that the Protections for Parliament men and their Servant from Arreſts, were not then grievous, when ſcarce any Parliament or Seſſion laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo long as one whole Term.</p>
               <p>In the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> 3. the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſometimes ſate but eight days, and ſometimes leſs, as may be ſeen in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Tower, and yet tranſacted ſeveral and weighty affairs of the Nation, many things being prepared before hand, (as ſome think) by the King and his privy Council, as they are at preſent in <hi>Sweden,</hi> and that commonly they then debated one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon ſuch things, as the King did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which is now done by the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Clergy of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The afore-mentioned expences being du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid, did cauſe all the petty decayed Burroughs of <hi>England</hi> to become hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Suitors to the King that they might not be obliged to ſend Burgeſſes to Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby it comes to paſs that divers were unburgeſſed, as it was in particular granted to <hi>Chipping,</hi> or <hi>Market Torriton</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their petition, and then the number of the Commons houſe being ſcarce half ſo many as at preſent, their Debates and Bills were ſooner expedited, no faction among them, nor diſtinction of parties, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95252:43"/>
by a bleſſed unanimity amongſt themſelves, and complyance with the Lords rarely denyed any thing to the King, and as rarely were denyed any thing by the King.</p>
               <p>The manner of debates of paſſing of Bills and Acts, is thus.</p>
               <p>It is the practiſe of each Houſe to debate not onely of what the King hath propoſed, but of any other matters, though heretofore that hath ſometimes been by their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign expreſſy forbidden.</p>
               <p>It is free for any man of the Parliament, or not of the Parliament, to get a Bill drawn by ſome Lawyer, and give the ſame to the Speaker or Clerk of the Parliament to be preſented at a time convenient, and this Bill may be put firſt either in the Lords Houſe or the Commons Houſe.</p>
               <p>Whatever is propoſed for a Law, is firſt put in Writing, and call'd a Bill, which, being read commonly after 9 of the clock in a full Aſſembly, it is either unanimouſly rejected at firſt, or elſe allowed to be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and then it is committed to a certain number of the Houſe preſently nominated and called a Committee. After it hath been amended, and twice read two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days in the Houſe, then it is is engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that is, written fair in Parchment, and read the third time another day, and then, if it be in the Lords Houſe, the Lord Keeper, in the Commons Houſe, the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er demandeth if they will have it put to the queſtion, whether a Law or no Law?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95252:43"/>
if the major part be for it, there is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the Bill by the Clerk, <hi>So it baillè aux Communes,</hi> or, <hi>So it baillè aux Seigneurs,</hi> retaining ſtill in this, and ſome other things about making Laws, the cuſtom of our Anceſtors, who were generally skilled in the French tongue.</p>
               <p>Note that when the Speaker finds divers Bills prepared to be put to the queſtion, he gives notice the day before, that on the morrow he intends to put ſuch Bills to the paſſing or third reading, and deſires the ſpecial attendance of all the Members.</p>
               <p>Note alſo, that if a Bill be rejected, it cannot be any more propoſed during that Seſſion.</p>
               <p>A Bill ſent by the Commons up to the Lords is uſuall (to ſhew their reſpect) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with 30 or 40 of the Members of the Houſe, as they come up to the Lords Bar, the Member that hath the Bill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king three profound reverences, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to the Lord Keeper, who for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe comes down to the Barr.</p>
               <p>A Bill ſent by the Lords to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, is uſually ſent by ſome of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Chancery, or other perſon whoſe place is on the Woolſacks (and by none of the Member, of that Houſe) and they coming up to the Speaker, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thrice, deliver to him the Bill, after one of them hath read the Title, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it may be there taken into conſideration, if aftewards it paſs that Houſe, then is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the Bill, <hi>Les Communes ont aſſentèz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:95252:44"/>When any one in the Commons Houſe will ſpeak to a Bill, he ſtands up unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and directs his Speech onely to the Speaker, then if what he delivers, be confuted by another, yet it is not allowed to anſwer again the ſame day, leſt the whole time ſhould be ſpent by two talkative per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Alſo if a Bill be debating in the Houſe, no man may ſpeak to it in one day above once.</p>
               <p>If any one ſpeak words of offence to the Kings Majeſty, or to the Houſe, he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Bar, and ſometimes ſent to the <hi>Tower.</hi> The Speaker is not allowed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade or diſſwade in paſſing of a Bill, but only to make a ſhort and plain Narrative, nor to Vote except the Houſe be equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
               <p>After Dinner the Parliament ordinarily Aſſembles not, though many times they continue ſitting long in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Committees ſit after dinner, where it is allowed to ſpeak, and reply as oft as they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>In the Lords Houſe, they give their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages or Votes beginning at the <hi>Puiſne</hi> or loweſt Baron, and ſo the reſt <hi>Seriatim,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one anſwering apart [<hi>content</hi>] or [<hi>not content.</hi>]</p>
               <p>In the Houſe of Commons they vote by <hi>Yea's and No's</hi> altogether, and if it be doubtful whether is the greater number, then the <hi>Yea</hi>'s, are to goe forth, and the <hi>No</hi>'s are to ſit ſtill (becauſe theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95252:44"/>
with their preſent condition, without any ſuch addition or alteration of Laws as the other deſire) and ſome are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to number them, but at a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, though it be of the whole Houſe as is ſometimes, the <hi>Yea</hi>'s go on one ſide, and the <hi>No</hi>'s on the other,, whereby they may be diſcerned.</p>
               <p>If a Bill paſs in one Houſe, and being ſent to the other Houſe, they demur upon it, then a Conference is demanded in the Painted Chamber, where certain deputed Members of each Houſe meet, the Lords ſitting covered at a Table, the Commons ſtanding bare with great reſpect, where the buſineſs is debated: if they then agree not, that buſineſs is nulled, but if they agree then it is at laſt brought (with all other Bills which have paſſed in both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) to the King, who comes again with His Crown on his Head, and clothed with His Royal Robes (ſometimes before His Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is to prorogue or diſſolve them;) and being ſeated in His Chair of State, and all the Lords in their Robes, the Clerk of the Crown reads the Title of each Bill, and as he reads, the Clerk of the Parliament, according to his inſtructions from the King, who before hath maturely conſidered each Bill, pronounceth the Royal Aſſent. If it be a publick Bill, the Anſwer is [<hi>Le Roy le veut</hi>] which gives Life and Birth to that Bill that was before but an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio.</hi> If a private Bill, the Anſwer is [<hi>Soit fait comme il eſt deſire</hi>] If it be a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95252:45"/>
publick Bill, which the King likes not, then the Anſwer is [<hi>Le Roys' aviſera</hi>] which is taken for an abſolute denyal in a more civil way, and that Bill wholly nulled. So that it is as true in <hi>England</hi> in ſome ſence, as in any Monarchy in the world, <hi>Quod Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipi placuit legis habet vigorem,</hi> Not that whatever the King of <hi>England</hi> wills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes immediately a Law, but that nothing except what the King wills hath the force of a Law.</p>
               <p>Note that the King without his perſonal preſence, can by Commiſſion granted to ſome of his Nobles, give His Royal Aſſent to any Bill that requires haſt.</p>
               <p>If it be a Bill for Moneys given to His Majeſty, then the anſwer is [<hi>Le Roy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercie ſes loyaux ſujets, accepte leur Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, &amp; auſſi le veut</hi>] which antient Ceremorny of thanking the Subject for parting with their Money, ſome think might better be ſpared, becauſe it intimates a diſtinct intereſt between the King and His Subjects, which is not onely falſe, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous to be allowed of. The King is <hi>Pater patriae,</hi> the Money given to him is for our uſe and benefit, if we are nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly to him, we injure ourſelves, &amp;c. The Bill for the Kings general Pardon, hath but one reading in either Houſe, for this reaſon, becauſe they muſt take it as the King will pleaſe to give it, ſo the Bill of Subſidies granted by the Clergy aſſembled in Convocation for the ſame reaſon. When the Bill for the general Pardon is paſſed by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95252:45"/>
the King the Anſwer is thus (<hi>les Prelats Signeurs &amp; communes en ce Parlament aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblez au nom de tous vos autres ſujets, remercient tres humblement voſtre Majeſte &amp; prient Dieu vous donner en ſante bonne vie &amp; longue.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Moſt of our antient Acts of Parliament run in this ſtile; The King at the humble requeſt of the Commons, with the aſſent of the Prelates, Dukes, Earles and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons hath ordained or enacted. After it was thus, The King by the Advice and Aſſent of the Lords Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and with the Aſſent of the Commons doth enact: of later times it hath been thus, Be it enacted by the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty, by and with the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and of the Commons: although the words of the Writ for ſummoning the Commons (which ought to be the main rule) is onely <hi>ad Conſentiendum,</hi> and not <hi>ad Conſilium impendendum,</hi> as it is in the Writ to the Lords: and it is evident that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the late long Parliament made that an advantage for juſtifying their uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations againſt the King in that point; and ſo in another Parliament, the Commons endeavoured to maintain that the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Lords was not always neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in an Act of Parliament, becauſe, 1 <hi>Edward</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. in paſſing that Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95252:46"/>
tranſportation of Horſes, the Lords were caſually omitted, yet by the Regiſter of the Lords Houſe, it appears that that Bill began firſt in the Lords Houſe, and there paſſed before the Commons took it in debate, and therefore the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at Law is very curious in wording rightly all Acts before they are brought to the King, and the Clerks of the Parliament as carefull in tranſcribing and regiſtring them: However it is to be wiſhed, that to prevent future miſchief to this Nation, ſome clauſes in the late Act of <hi>Oblivion</hi> and <hi>Indemnity</hi> might be amended, or at leaſt explained, and more eſpecially about the beginning of that Act, theſe words (<hi>That all manner of Treaſons, &amp;c. ſince</hi> January 1637. <hi>and before</hi> June 1660. <hi>by vertue of any Authority from His late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. King</hi> Charles, <hi>or His Majeſty that now is, be pardoned, &amp;c.</hi>) which words might poſſibly be foiſted in deſignedly to inſinuate, as if (according to that moſt abſurd and Traiterous poſition of ſome of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Members of the Long Parliament) the Kings perſon or any commiſſionated by him, could be guilty of Treaſon againſt the Kings Authority, or againſt His two Houſes of Parliament, by purſuing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to bring them to Juſtice according to the Laws of the Land. It were alſo to be deſired, that to prevent the great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of making additional and explanato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Acts of Parliament, ſo frequently as hath of late been done, all conſiderable
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95252:46"/>
Bills of Publick concernment, once read in either Houſe of Parliament, may (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be paſſed) be expoſed to the view of all comers (as antiently among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans was uſual) to the end that any other perſon (beſides thoſe of the two Houſes) may within the ſpace of certain days freely propoſe in Writing or otherwiſe, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, additions, alterations, or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Sed haec obiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When thoſe things for which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſummoned have been ſufficiently treated and brought to a concluſion, then the King doth uſually adjourn, prorogue or diſſolve the Parliament in maner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The adjournments are uſually made in the Lords Houſe, by the Lord Keeper, in the Kings Name, to what other day the King pleaſeth, and alſo to what other place if he think fit to remove them, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hath been done, and then all things already debated and read in one or both Houſes, continue to the next meeting in the ſame ſtate, they were in before the adjournment, and ſo may be reſumed.</p>
               <p>In the like maner, the Parliament is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued, but by a Prorogation there is a Seſſion, and then the Bills that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ready in both Houſes for the Royal Aſſent, not having it, muſt at the reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of the Parliament begin anew.</p>
               <p>The Speaker of the Houſe of Commons upon notice given that it is the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that Houſe ſhall alſo adjourn, doth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95252:47"/>
ſay, with the aſſent of the Houſe, This Houſe is adjourned.</p>
               <p>When the Kings pleaſure is to prorogue or diſſolve the Parliament, His Majeſty commonly cometh in perſon with His Crown on his Head, ſendeth for all the Houſe of Commons, to come to the Bar of the Lords Houſe: and after the Kings anſwer to each Bill ſignified as aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, His Majeſty uſually makes a Solemn Speech, the Lord Keeper another, and the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons a third, then the Lord Keeper by the ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the King doth pronounce the Parliament prorogued or diſſolved.</p>
               <p>Note, That the King being head of the Parliament, if his death doth happen du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſitting of the Parliament, it is, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> diſſolved.</p>
               <p>Antiently, after every Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the King commanded every Sheriff to proclaim the ſeveral Acts, and to cauſe them to be duly obſerved, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Proclamation, the Law intended that every one hath notice by his repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of what is tranſacted in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: of later times ſince Printing became common, that Cuſtom hath been laid aſide.</p>

               <p>A Brief account of the Legiſlative power in Temporall affairs, having been given, next may be conſidered the Executive power in thoſe affairs, and that is generally in the King, he is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Juſtice; he is the Fountain of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; he is the Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi>; and therefore as all the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are called the Kings Laws, becauſe he is <hi>Caput, Principium, &amp; Finis Parliamenti,</hi> by which the Laws are made, and that nothing can have the Force of a Law, but what he wills; ſo all the Courts of Judicature are called the Kings Courts, and all the Judges of thoſe Courts are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Kings Judges.</p>
               <p>The higheſt Court of Judicature in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is the Houſe of Lords in Parliament; ſo that the Parliament is not only <hi>Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> but <hi>Curia,</hi> a Court of Judicature, conſiſting as aforementioned, of all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, as Judges; and theſe aſſiſted with the moſt grave and eminent Lawyers of <hi>England</hi> both in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Civil Law.</p>
               <p>To the Judicature of this Supreme and moſt Honourable Court, all other Courts and Perſons that are Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> are Subject and accountable for all Crimes
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95252:65"/>
not properly tryable, remediable, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable in other inferiour Courts of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and to this Court all laſt Appeals are to be made, and from whoſe Sentence there lies no appeal, but to a ſucceeding Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and this ſupreme Judicatory or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Power lyes only in the King and Houſe of Lords; and at the Bar of this High Court may the Houſe of Commons, as the Grand Inqueſt of the Nation, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the higheſt Subject of <hi>England,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Clergy, or of the Laity, and proſecute them till it come to a Sentence, after which there can be no farther procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, till the King informed of the whole matter, gives His Royal Aſſent for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the ſaid Sentence, or grant His gracious Pardon.</p>
               <p>In the late Long Parliament, the Houſe of Commons pretended to be alſo a Court of Judicature, and at length uſurped a moſt exorbitant power to the total ruine of Monarchical Government, and it is worth obſerving by what Gradations they arrived thereto. In the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and not before, the Commons began to take upon them (as ſaith Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> a learned Member of that Houſe) to ſeclude one another for undue Elections; whereas formerly the King and Lords were accounted the ſole Judges of all Members of the Commons Houſe, and to have the ſole power to judge of their undue Elections, Returns, Miſdemeanors, Breaches of Privileges, and of all other
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95252:66"/>
matters concerning their Memberſhip; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for freeing any Member from Arreſt or Impriſonments, did wholely and ſolely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Lords, and not to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, unleſs it were by ſpecial order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by the Lords to the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as heretofore ſometimes hath been done.</p>
               <p>In the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr the Commons went farther, took upon them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to expel out of their Houſe ſome of their fellow Members, as Projectors and Monopolizers, although they had been duly elected: After this in the ſame Kings time, they expelled all ſuch as adhered in Loyalty to the King; next they ſecluded and impriſoned all ſuch as the Officers of the late rebellious Army impeached, or diſliked; then by the help of that Army, 50 or 60 of the Members of that Houſe expelled all the reſt of their fellows, and ſoon after, voted down the King and whole Houſe of Lords, and voted themſelves to be the Parliament; to be the ſole Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and the Supreme Authority of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; into ſuch a prodigious height of folly and impiety do men run, when they, once allow themſelves to paſs their, due li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.</p>

This Book is kept under three Locks and Keys, not to be lookt into under 6s. 8d. and for every line tranſcribed is to be paid 4d.</p>
               <p>Next is the <hi>Auditor</hi> of the Receipts, Sir <hi>Robert Long,</hi> whoſe Office is to file the Bills of the Tellers, whereby they charge themſelves with all moneys received, and to draw all Orders to be ſigned by the Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, for iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth all moneys by vertue of Privy Seals, which are recorded and lodged in his Office.

               <p>He that payes the King any moneys, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives for his Acquittance a Tally, that is, the one half of a ſtick cloven with certain proportionable Notches thereon, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the ſum from the ſaid Deputy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlains, who keep the other cloven part of the ſtick called the Foyl, and deliver it to the Tally-Joyners on the other ſide of the Exchequer, who are alſo Deputies to the Chamberlains, and they joyn it with the Foyl, which agreeing, they give it their Teſt, and ſend it by an Officer of their own to the Pipe where their <hi>Quietus eſt</hi> is engroſſed in Parchment.</p>
               <p>Other Officers in the Exchequer are the two Uſhers, <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Philip Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> Eſquires, whoſe Office is to take care to ſecure the Exchequer by day and by night, and all the Avenues leading to the fame, and to furniſh all neceſſaries, as Books, Paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The Judge of this Court is the Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> He is here the ſole Judge, whereas in other Courts there are three or four Judges, but he may and doth often in caſes of greater weight and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, in caſes of Law, call ſome of the other Judges to his aſſiſtance, and therefore it is ſaid, this Office may be diſcharged by one that is no profeſſed Lawyer, as it was almoſt always antiently, and ſo of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times by Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton,</hi> and after by Doctor <hi>Williams</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi> to their great praiſe and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It is the higheſt Dignity in <hi>England</hi> that a Lay-man is capable of, it is <hi>Summum am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bientis animi quaſi Solſtitium,</hi> and the Chancellor is <hi>Magiſtratuum omnium Antiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Antiently, the Lord Chancellor had ſometimes his Vicechancellor, commonly called Keeper of the Great Seal, but of later times they differ onely in name.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France,</hi> he that is made Chancellour is <hi>durante vita,</hi> his place cannot be taken

away, although the Seales may. It is ſaid there, that he is ſo to attend to the ſole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the King and People, that he muſt not be ſenſible of any Relations or other conſideration, and therefore he may not put himſelf in mourning, neither for his own Father, nor for the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Chancellours have been in <hi>England,</hi> as the learned <hi>Dugdale</hi> finds, as ſoon as Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity was embraced by the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Chancellor is ſaid to be keeper of the Kings Conſcience, to judge <hi>ſecundum aequum &amp; bonum,</hi> according to equity and conſcience, he is to moderate the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the exact rigour and letter of the Law, whereunto other Judges are ſtrictly tyed: for the Princes of this Realm, in imitation of the King of Kings, governing the World by juſtice and mercy, have erected two ſupreme Tribunals, together at the upper end of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> one of Juſtice, wherein nothing but the ſtrict Letter of the Law is obſerved, and the other of Mercy, wherein the Rigour of the Law is tempered with the ſweetneſs of Equity, which is nothing elſe but Mercy qualifying the ſharpneſs of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>This Court being a Court of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the leſs it is perplexed with the quirks of Lawyers, the more it is guided by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Equity, and therefore the Kings of <hi>England</hi> would have this Court ſuperiour to the other Tribunals, that ſo if any thing was done amiſs by thoſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95252:79"/>
the Rigour of the Law, here good by Conſcience and Equity, it might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; wherein they followed the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pattern of the Great <hi>Conſtantine, qui omnes ſuas leges imperfectas eſſe voluit ut inde ſubditi ſui appellarent ad Epiſcopos,</hi> and therefore in all former times, the Judges of this Court were choſen out of the Clergy, able Divines, who by their skil in the Law of God, and of Nations, were beſt able to judge according to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Equity, and moſt willing to execute accordingly: alſo fitteſt to diſpoſe of the Kings ſpiritual Benefices.</p>
               <p>Beſides when this High Office was given to Biſhops and Clergy men, in whom wealth and a publick Spirit being uſually conjoyned, what great publick Acts of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Charity, were done by them for this Nation? to mention onely in <hi>Oxford,</hi> What noble and rich foundations are <hi>Chriſt-church, Magdalens, New Colledge,</hi> and <hi>Merton Colledge</hi>? all founded by Biſhops that were Chancellors; and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſince the places of Chancellor, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, Privy Seal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been uſually in the Hands of Lay-men, what one great work hath been done for the Publick, but onely wealth heaped up for their own private Families.</p>
               <p>The manner of Proceeding in this Court, is much like that in the Courts of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law, the Actions by Bill or Plaint, the Witneſſes examined in private, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees in <hi>Engli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No Jury of twelve men, but all Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces given by the Judge of the Court.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor or Lord Keeper hath twelve aſſiſtants, antiently called <hi>Clerici,</hi> or <hi>Magiſtri Cancellariae,</hi> becauſe they were uſually in Holy Orders, and all Doctors of Laws, for Maſter and Doctor was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently the ſame, as at this day, a Doctor in the Arts, is called <hi>Magiſter in Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is called <hi>Maſter of the Rolls,</hi> a place of great dignity, and is in the gift of the King, either for life or during His Majeſties pleaſure; and this Officer hath <hi>jure Officii,</hi> the gift of thoſe conſiderable Offices of the ſix Clerks in <hi>Chancery,</hi> hath the keeping of the Rolls, hath the Houſe of the converted Jews now called the Rolls, and in the abſence of the Chancellor heares <hi>Cauſes and makes Orders</hi> by Vertue of a Commiſſion, with two Maſters and not <hi>jure Officii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One reaſon why the Maſters of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery were ever Civilians, may be, becauſe for all caſes almoſt imaginable ſome Law or caſe conformable thereunto, may be fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a good Civilian out of that Law of Laws, called the Civil Law. Another may be, becauſe the Chancery more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient then in any other Court of <hi>England</hi> (for all Original writs and Comiſſions, whereupon the other Courts do ground all their proceedings do come from thence) hath probably been taken from the Civil Law, divers points of proceedings not
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:95252:80"/>
uſed in Common Law Courts, as the Defendants anſwering to the Bill, and ſometimes to the Interrogatories upon Oath, though to the accuſing of a mans ſelf, in divers matters dammageable, and penal; alſo by the whole manner of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, the depoſitions of Witneſſes, by the examining of witneſſes upon Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories, and <hi>in perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> by the term and uſe of final Decree, and many other points differing from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and wholly agreeing with the Civil Law.</p>
               <p>This Court is alwayes open, when all the others are ſhut, but onely in Term time; ſo that if a man be wrongfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, in the Vacation time out of Term, the Lord Chancellour may grant his Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and do him juſtice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law; So likewiſe may this Court grant Prohibitions in time of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as well as in Term time.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95252:85"/>
or reſpect, are called Juſtices of the <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> from thoſe words in the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Quorum</hi> A. B. <hi>unum eſſe volumus,</hi> that is, ſome buſineſs of more importance, may not be tranſacted without the preſence or concurrence of one of them.</p>
               <p>One of the principal Juſtices of Peace and <hi>Quorum,</hi> is by the Lord Keeper made <hi>Cuſtos Rotulorum,</hi> ſo called, becauſe he hath the Cuſtody of the Rolls, or Records of the Seſſions, and is to bring them to each Quarter Seſſions.</p>
               <p>The Original of Juſtices of Peace is from the firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Their Office is to call before them, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and commit to Priſon all Theeves, Murderers, wandring Rogues, thoſe that hold Conſpiracies, Conventicles, Riots, and almoſt all other Delinquences that may occaſion the breach of Peace and quiet to the Kings Subjects; to commit all ſuch to priſon, as either cannot, or by Law are not, to be bailed (that is, cannot be ſet at liberty by Sureties, taken for their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at a place and time certain) land to ſee them brought forth in due time to Tryal.</p>
               <p>Every Quarter or three months, the Juſtices meet at the chief or Shire Town, where the Grand Enqueſt or Jury of the County is ſummoned to appear, who upon Oath, are to inquire of all Traitors, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, Theeves, Murderers, Money-coiners, Riots, <hi>&amp;c</hi> Thoſe that appear to be guilty, are by the ſaid Juſtices com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95252:85"/>
to priſon, to be tryed at the next Aſſiſes, when the Judges of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> come their Circuits aforementioned.</p>
               <p>For execution of Laws in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty except <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> and <hi>Durham</hi>; the King every <hi>Michaelmas Term,</hi> nominates for each County, a Sheriff, that is a <hi>Reeve</hi> of the Shire, <hi>Praepoſitus</hi> or <hi>Praefectus Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatus,</hi> a Governor or Guardian of the County, for the words of the Patent are, <hi>Commiſimus tibi Cuſtodiam Commitatus noſtri de</hi> N.</p>
               <p>The Sheriffs Office is to execute the Kings Mandates, and all Writs directed to him out of the Kings Courts, to empannel Juries, to bring Cauſes and Criminals to Tryal, to ſee the ſentences both in Civil and Criminal affairs executed; to wait on and guard the Itenerant Judges twice a year, ſo long as they continue within the County, which at the Aſſiſes is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Pomp, Splendor, Feaſting, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> In order to the better execution of his Office, the Sheriff hath attendant his Under-Sheriff divers clerks, Stewards of Courts, Bayliffs of Hundreds, Conſtables<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gaolers, Sergeants or Beedles, beſides a gallant train of ſervants in rich Liveries, all on Horſeback at the Reception of the Judges.</p>
               <p>He was antiently choſen as Knights of the Shire, but to avoid Tumults it is now thus.</p>
               <p>Every year about the beginning of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> the Judges Itinerant nominate
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95252:86"/>
ſix fit men of each County, that is Kts. or Eſquires of good Eſtates, out of theſe the Lords Keeper, Treaſurer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Privy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and 12 Judges aſſembled in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer Chamber and ſworn, make choice of three, of which the King himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter chooſeth one to be Sheriff, for that year only, though heretofore it was for many years, and ſometimes heriditary; as at this day to the <hi>Cliffords,</hi> who by diſſent from <hi>Robert de Vipont</hi> are Sheriffs heridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the County of <hi>Weſtmoreland</hi> by Charter from King <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore the Sheriffs Office is to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all publick profits, Cuſtomes, Taxes of the County, all Fines, Diſtreſſes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merceaments, and to bring them into the Kings Exchequer or Treaſury at <hi>London,</hi> or elſe where, as the King ſhall appoint.</p>
               <p>The Sheriff of each County hath a double function, firſt Miniſterial to execute all Proceſſes and Precepts of the Courts of Law, and to make returns of the ſame. Secondly, Judicial, whereby he hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to hold two ſeveral Courts of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct nature, the one called the Sheriffs <hi>Turn,</hi> which he holdeth in ſeveral places of the County, enquiring of all Criminal Offences againſt the Common-Law, not prohibited by any Statute: The other cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the County Court wherein he hears and determines civil Cauſes of the County un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 40 <hi>s.</hi> which antiently was a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſumme; ſo that by the great fall of the moneys now, the Sheriffs authority in that part is much diminiſhed.</p>

               <p>He is for his time (which is but for one year) as it were a Judge to determine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to mitigate the Rigour of the Law.</p>
               <p>The next in Government of Cities are two principal Officers called, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> who are Judges in <hi>civil</hi> cauſes within this City, and to ſee all execution done, whether <hi>penal</hi> or <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,</hi> and ſhould rather be called, <hi>Stat-reeves</hi> or <hi>Port-reeves</hi>

               <p>In Cities the people are generally made more induſtrious by Manufactures, and leſs idleneſs ſuffered then in other places, ſo that in ſome Cities, children of ſix or ſeven years old are made to gain their own expences. In the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> it hath of late

yeares been computed and found, that year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly children from 6 to 10 years of age, have gained 12 thouſand pounds more then what they ſpend, and that chiefly by knitting fine <hi>Jerſey</hi> Stockings.</p>
               <p>The Government of <hi>Burroughs,</hi> and other Towns corporate is much after the ſame manner. In ſome, there is a Mayor, in others, one or two Bailiffs, who have equal power with a Mayor and Sheriffs, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Offices, they are Juſtices of the Peace within their Liberties, and have there the ſame power, that other Juſtices of the Peace have in the County.</p>
               <p>For the better Government of Villages, the Lord of the place hath ordinarily pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to hold a <hi>Court-Baron,</hi> ſo called, becauſe antiently ſuch Lords were called <hi>Barons,</hi> as they are ſtill in many parts of <hi>France</hi>: or elſe <hi>Court Baron</hi> (i. e.)

               <p>For regulating and ordering His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Land Forces, that are in conſtant pay, there are no Orders, yet ſetled by Act of Parliament, as there are for his Sea Forces, but may be in a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the afore-mentioned Forces there is the ſtanding <hi>Militia</hi> by Land of all <hi>England</hi> ſetled in the King, to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ordered, and enlarged from time to time as his Majeſty ſhall ſee occaſion.</p>
               <p>For the management of theſe ſtanding Land Forces the King himſelf makes choice of divers of the principal Peers of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and by Commiſſion creates them Lord Lieutenants of the ſeveral Counties of <hi>England,</hi> with power to arm, array, and form into Companies, Troops, and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to conduct (upon occaſion of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion or Invaſions) and employ the men ſo armed within the Counties and Places for which the ſaid Lords are commiſſioned, or into any other County, as the King ſhall give order. To give Commiſſions to Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, or other Commiſſioned Officers, to preſent to the King the names of the Deputy-Lieutenants, who have in the abſence of the Lord Lieutenant the ſame power (and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95252:91"/>
theſe are to be of the prime Gentry of the County) to charge any perſon in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Horſe, Horſemen, and Arms, or Foot Souldiers and Arms within the ſaid County, proportionable to their eſtates, with limitation that no perſon be charged with a Horſe, unleſs he hath 500 <hi>l.</hi> yearly Revenue, or 6000 <hi>l.</hi> in perſonal Eſtate. No perſon to be charged with a Foot Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, unleſs he hath 50 <hi>l.</hi> yearly Revenue, or 600 <hi>l.</hi> perſonal Eſtate. Thoſe that have meaner Eſtates are to joyn two or three to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to find a Horſe and Horſeman, or a Foot Souldier.</p>
               <p>The forementioned Horſe and Foot are to muſter once or twice a year, and each Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man during the time of the Muſter to be allowed him for whom he ſerves 2 <hi>s.</hi> a day, and each Foot Souldier 12 <hi>d.</hi> a day.</p>
               <p>For furniſhing Ammunition and other Neceſſaries, the Lord Lieutenant, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Lieutenants may levy every year one fourth part (if they judge it expedient) of each mans proportion in the Tax of 70000 <hi>l.</hi> a moneth upon the whole Kingdom: And in the caſe of marching againſt an enemy, they have power to cauſe every man ſo charged to allow each Souldier one months pay, which the King is after to repay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may be charged with another moneths pay.</p>
               <p>Theſe Forces are alwayes in readineſs with all things neceſſary at the beat of a Drum, or ſound of Trumpet, to appear, muſter, and be compleat with men, horſe,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95252:92"/>
and armes, and are at certain times train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſciplined, that they become able, skilful, and uſeful Souldiers.</p>
               <p>Theſe are to be commanded only within the Kingdom, for the ſecurity of the King and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Subſervient in the ſtanding <hi>Militia</hi> to the Lord Lieutenant, and Deputy Lieutenant are the Juſtices of Peace of every County, who upon all occaſions according to the orders of their Superiors, are to ſend their Warrants to the High Conſtable of the Hundred, or Petty Conſtable of the Pariſh, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe are commonly called the Train-bands of every County, whereof the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is ſo great, that in only five of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Counties of <hi>England</hi> there are to be found well provided forty thouſand able luſty men ready to aſſiſt the King upon all occaſions, ſo that in all times of peace the King hath ſix or ſevenſcore thouſand men enrolled, and wholly and ſolely at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, for the defence of his Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better ſecuring of the Kingdom from foreign Invaſion, beſides the Ships of war (whereof more anon) there are upon certain eminent places over al parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> mediterrane as well as maritime, high Poles erected, whereon are faſtned pitch Barrels to be fired by night; and a ſmoke made by day, and thereby to give notice in few hours to the whole Kingdom of the approaching Invaſion: whereupon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95252:92"/>
in arms make haſte to the ſea-coaſts. Theſe are called Becons, from the Saxon <hi>Beacen</hi> or <hi>Beacnian,</hi> to ſhew by a ſign. In all times of danger ſome are ſet to watch at every Becon.</p>
               <p>Antiently there were many Caſtles in all parts of <hi>England</hi>; but inland Caſtles ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally have either been demoliſht in latter times, or wittingly ſuffered to decay, that to Rebels they might be no ſhelter, to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders no ſtay, nor to the Invaded any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in flight, and conſequently, that there may not be any <hi>lingring war</hi> again in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is the greateſt miſery and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity that can ever happen to a Nation.</p>
               <p>In 1588. upon expectation of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Armado ſtiled invincible, there went forth from the Queen Commiſſions to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in all parts of <hi>England,</hi> all men that were of perfect ſenſe and limb, from the age of 16. to 60, except Noblemen, Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Univerſity Students, Lawyers, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and ſuch as had any publick charges, leaving only in every Pariſh ſo many Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen as were ſufficient to till the ground. In all thoſe Muſters there were then numbred three millions: but of thoſe fit for war, about ſix hundred thouſand.</p>
               <p>In another Muſter of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> there were found in all <hi>England</hi> fit for war of common Souldiers, about four hundred thouſand, and of thoſe armed and trained one hundred eighty five thouſand, beſides Horſe near forty thouſand: and that the Nobility and Gentry were then able to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95252:93"/>
bring into the field of their Servants and Followers twenty thouſand men Horſe and Foot choice men, and excellent horſes; and in all fit for war, and ready upon all occaſions, ſix hundred forty two thouſand, leaving ſufficient to till the ground, and to furniſh Trades, beſides Nobility, Gentry, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Royal Soveraign,</hi> being a Ship of the Firſt Rate or Rank, built in the Year One thouſand ſix hundred thirty and ſeven, is in length by the Keel One hundred twenty ſeven Foot, in bredth by the Beam Forty ſeven Foot, in depth Forty nine Foot, her draught of Water Twenty one Foot: Of burden, in all Two thouſand ſeventy and two Tuns; and One thouſand five hundred fifty and four Tuns, beſides Guns, Tackle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This mighty Moving-Caſtle hath Six Anchors, whereof the biggeſt weighs 6000 <hi>l.</hi> and the leaſt 4300 <hi>l.</hi> It hath Fourteen Cables, whereof the greateſt is Twenty one Inches in compaſs, and weighs 9000 <hi>l.</hi> Her leaſt Cable being eight Inches in compaſs, weighing near 1300 <hi>l.</hi>

               <p>She carries a long Boat of Fifty Foot, a Pinnace of Thirty ſix Foot, and a Skiff of Twenty ſeven Foot long.</p>
               <p>The weight of her Rigging is Three and thirty Tun.</p>
               <p>She hath Three Tire of Guns, all of Braſs, whereof there are Forty four in her upper Tire, Thirty four in her ſecond Tire, and Twenty two in her lower Tire, in all One hundred Guns.</p>
               <p>She carries in all, of Officers, Soldiers, and Mariners, Seven hundred Men.</p>
               <p>Finally, Her whole Charges for Wages, Victuals, Ammunition, wear and tear, for every Moneth at Sea, coſts the King 3500 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, as hath been computed by a very skilful perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:95252:96"/>The charges of Building a Ship of the Firſt Rate, together with Guns, Tackle, and Rigging (beſides Victualing) doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily amount to about 62432 <hi>l.</hi> Thoſe of Lower Rates proportionally.</p>
               <p>The King hath now Six Ships of the Firſt Rate, whereof Five are longer by the Keel then the forementioned <hi>Royal Soveraign,</hi> and all of the ſame force, except two, which yet may carry each one, One hundred and ten Guns.</p>

               <p>The Proceeding in this Court in all <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Matters, is according to the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Sea</hi> is without the limits of the <hi>Common-Law,</hi> but under the <hi>Admirals</hi> Juriſdiction; therefore the <hi>Civil Law</hi> onely (all Common Law ſecluded) is made uſe of, and, by <hi>Libel</hi> they proceed to the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Plaintiff giving Caution to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Sute, and to pay what ſhall be judged againſt him, if he fail in the Sute, the Defendant on the contrary ſecuring the Plaintiff by ſufficient ſurety or caution, as the Judge ſhall think meet, that he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Judgment, and pay that which ſhall be adjudged againſt him, and that he will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and allow all that his Proctor ſhall do in his name, whereby the Clients are well aſſured to obtain that which by Law ſhall be adjudged to them, let the Cauſe fall on which ſide ſoever.</p>

                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:95252:113"/>THe former Burſe began to be erected in the year 1566. juſt one hundred years before it was burnt: it was built at the coſt and charges of a noble Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham,</hi> and in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner by a Herald and Trumpet, in the preſence and by the ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> proclaimed and named the <hi>ROYAL EXCHANGE:</hi> it was built moſt of Brick, and yet was the moſt ſplendid Burſe (all things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that was then in <hi>Europe</hi> (before the building whereof the Burſe for Merchants was kept in <hi>Lumbard-ſtreet</hi>).</p>
               <p>Now it is built within and without of the forementioned excellent ſtone, with ſuch curious and admirable Architecture, that it ſurpaſſeth all other Burſes, <hi>Quantum lenta ſolent inter Viburna Cupreſſi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is built Quadrangular, with a large Court, wherein the Merchants may aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the greateſt part, in caſe of rain or hot ſun-ſhine, may be ſheltered in ſide-Galleries or Portico's. The whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick coſt above fifty thouſand pounds, whereof one half is disburſed by the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>London,</hi> or Corporation of the City, and the other half by the Company of <hi>Mercers</hi>: and to reimburſe themſelves, there will be let to hire 190 Shops above ſtairs, at 20 <hi>l.</hi> yearly rent each, and 30 <hi>l.</hi> for fine, beſides the ſeveral Shops below, on the Eaſt and Weſt ſides, and the huge
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95252:113"/>
vaulted Cellers under ground, ſo that it will be the richeſt piece of ground, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in the whole world; for, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to exact dimenſions, the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this goodly Fabrick is erected, is but 171 foot from North to South, and 203 foot from Eaſt to Weſt (for it is <hi>Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum oblongum</hi>) ſo that it is but very little more then three quarters of an Acre of Ground, and will produce above 4000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly Rent.</p>
               <p>The River whereon is ſeated this Great City, for its breadth, depth, gentle, ſtrait, even courſe, extraordinary wholeſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Tides, is more commodious for Navigation then perhaps any other River in the world. The Sea flows gently up this River fourſcore miles, that is, almoſt to <hi>Kingſton,</hi> twelve miles above <hi>London</hi> by land, and twenty by water, bringing the greater Veſſels to <hi>London,</hi> and the ſmaller beyond; then againſt the Stream, boats are drawn to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and higher ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miles.</p>
               <p>It is high water at this City as oft as the Moon comes to the North Eaſt and South Weſt points of Heaven, the one in our Hemiſphere, and the other in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hemiſphere. The higheſt Tides are upon a Land Flood, the Wind North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt at the Equinoctial, and the Moon at full: when theſe four cauſes concur (which is very rare) then the <hi>Thames</hi> ſwells in ſome places over its Banks, and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This River opening Eaſtward towards <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France</hi> is much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous for Traffick than any other River of <hi>England.</hi> To ſay nothing of the variety of excellent Fiſh within this River, the fruitful fat ſoil, the pleaſant rich Meadows, and innumerable ſtately Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on both ſides thereof; in a word, the <hi>Thames</hi> ſeems to be the very Radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of this City, and in ſome ſenſe, the natural heat too, for almoſt all the Fuel for firing is brought up this River from <hi>Newcaſtle, Scotland, Kent, Eſſex,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From this River the City by water En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins is in many places ſupplyed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celient wholſome water; alſo from almoſt twenty Conduits of pure Spring water; and moreover; by a new River, brought at a vaſt charge and exquiſite skill (by Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton</hi> who deſerves his Statue in Braſs) from <hi>Amwell</hi> and <hi>Chad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> two Springs near <hi>Ware</hi> in <hi>Hartford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> from whence, in a turning and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing courſe, it runs threeſcore miles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it reaches this City; In ſome places the Channel is neceſſarily thirty foot deep, in other place it is carried over valeys more then twenty foot high above ground, in open Troughs. Over this new
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95252:114"/>
River are made eight hundred Bridges, ſome of Stone, ſome of Brick, and ſome of Wood: Six hundred men have been at once employed in this great work. It was begun 1608. and finiſhed in five years. It ſerves the higheſt parts of <hi>London</hi> in their lower Rooms, and the lower parts in their higheſt Rooms.</p>
               <p>The vaſt Traffick and Commerce where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this City doth flouriſh, may be gueſſed at chiefly by the Cuſtoms which are paid for all Merchandiſe imported or exported, which are but very moderate Impoſitions in compariſon of the Impoſts of moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> and yet the Cuſtoms of the Port of <hi>London</hi> onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to above three hundred thouſand pounds a year: By the infinite number of Ships, which by their Maſts reſemble a Foreſt as they lye along this ſtream, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many that are ſent forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every year to carry and fetch Commodities to and from all parts of the known world, whereby it comes to paſs, that no ſmall number of Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> for Wealth, for ſtately Houſes within the City for Winter, and without for Summer, for rich Furniture, plentiful Tables, and honorable living, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> excel ſome Princes in divers of our neighbour Nations: Moreover, one may conjecture at the huge Commerce by the infinite number of great well furniſhed Shops; which a <hi>Spaniard</hi> once obſerving, together with
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95252:115"/>
the great number of Law ſutes, in Term time, made this report of <hi>London</hi> to his Country-men, that it was indeed a great City, but made up of nothing but <hi>Tiendas y Contiendas,</hi> Shops and Sutes: whereas he might rather have ſaid more truly, in a few more words, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>London</hi> is a huge Magazin of Men, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Ships, Horſes and Ammunition of all ſorts of Commodities neceſſary or expedient for the uſe or pleaſure of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: that <hi>London</hi> is the mighty Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of Nobility, Gentry, Courtiers, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, Lawyers, Phyſitians, Merchants, Seamen, and all kinds of excellent Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, of the moſt refined Wits and moſt excellent Beauties; for it is obſerved that in moſt Families of <hi>England,</hi> if there be any Son or Daughter that excels the reſt in Beauty or Wit, or perhaps Courage or Induſtry, or any other rare quality, <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> is their <hi>North-ſtar,</hi> and they are never at reſt till they point directly thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The Government of this City, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the greatneſs and populouſneſs thereof is very admirable, and might take up a Volume in the deſcription there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſtical Government is by a Biſhop, was in the time of the <hi>Britains</hi> by an Archbiſhop, but when it became ſubject to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the Archiepiſcopal Sea, was placed at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> not becauſe that was
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95252:115"/>
the more worthy City; but for the ſake of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who firſt preacht the Goſpel there to the Heathen Saxons, and was there buried. Since which time it hath been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Biſhop above ten Centuries and a half, in a continual ſucceſſion, in which ſpace there are reckoned 99 Biſhops of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to the Preſent worthy Biſhop thereof, the grave, learned, pious, divine Doctor <hi>Humphry Henchman</hi> conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> 1660. and tranſlated to <hi>London</hi> 1663. To his Cathedral alſo belongs a Dean, a Chapter, a Treaſurer and Thirty Prebendaries, all perſons of worth.</p>
               <p>For the Eccleſiaſtical Government of the ſeveral Pariſhes, there are are placed many excellent Divines, that have the Cure of Souls, a Rector or Vicar for every Pariſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and theſe have for a long time had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the moſt excellent way of Sermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing in Chriſtendom, inſomuch as divers Divines of foreign Reformed Churches have come hither on purpoſe to learn their manner of haranguing in the Pulpit.</p>
               <p>For maintaining theſe Divines with their families there is in every Pariſh a Parſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age or Vicaridge houſe, and in moſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent allowance in Tithes. Antiently the Parſons due in <hi>London,</hi> beſides the Tithes of the Trades-mens Gains, and Mortuaries, Obits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was 3 <hi>s.</hi> 5 <hi>d.</hi> in the pound of the yearly Rent, of all Houſes and Shops; and this was paid as Offerings on Sundayes and Holidayes onely a half penny for each pound, whereby the Pariſhioners did hardly
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95252:116"/>
feel it, although the Sundayes and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes were ſo many that in a whole year it amounted to 3 <hi>s.</hi> 5 <hi>d.</hi> in the pound. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards many Holidayes being taken away, and the Clergy Means thereby abated, it was ordained 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. that 2 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> in the pound of all Rents of Houſes and Shops ſhould be paid yearly to the Parſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the <hi>Londoners</hi> did not onely conſent (as they had good reaſon, it being much leſs in the pound then before) but bound themſelves by an Act of Common Council to perform the ſame, and the ſaid Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was confirmed in Parliament 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and again 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. with a power given to the Lord Mayor to commit to priſon any Citizen that ſhould refuſe to pay his Tythes and Dues according to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. But ſince the Reformation, many men willing to think Tythes a rag of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or elſe making no conſcience of robbing God, have deviſed many baſe and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wayes by double Leaſes, by great Fines and ſmall Rents, and ſeveral other wayes to cheat the Law and their God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8. complaint whereof being made to King <hi>James</hi> 1618. it was declared in his Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> by the Barons there, that the Inhabitants of <hi>London,</hi> and of the Liberties thereof, ought ſtill (according to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Acts) to pay 2 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> in the pound, according to the true yearly value of the Rent of their Houſes and Shops from time to time; but the Citizens (who think 2000 <hi>l. per annum.</hi> not enough for an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman

               <p>The Civil Government is not (as it is at <hi>Paris, Rome, Madrid, Vienna,</hi> and other Capital Cities) by a chief Magiſtrate, ſome Nobleman ſet over the City by the King or Supreme Governor; or, as it was here, in the time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> when the chief Magiſtrate was called (as it is ſtill in <hi>Rome</hi>) the <hi>Prefect</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> or, as it was in the time of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> when he was called the <hi>Portgreve,</hi> that is, <hi>Cuſtos</hi> or <hi>Guardian,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Provoſt</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but after the coming in of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> the chief Magiſtrate was called <hi>Bailive</hi> (from the French word <hi>Bailler, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, committere</hi>) that is <hi>Commiſſarius,</hi> or one that hath Commiſſion to govern others, and there were ſometimes two <hi>Bailiffs</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> till King <hi>Rich.</hi> I. <hi>Anno</hi> 1189. changed the name of <hi>Bailiff</hi> into <hi>MAYOR,</hi> which alſo, being derived from the French, hath continued ever ſince, a Citizen cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the Citizens annually, unleſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the diſloyalty of the Citizens, their Priviledges and Franchiſes have been taken from them, and a Guardian ſet over them, as was done by <hi>Hen.</hi> III. and <hi>Edw.</hi> I.</p>

               <p>There are Two Inns of Sergeants, Four Inns of Court, and Eight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inns of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</p>
               <p>The Inns of Chancery were probably ſo named; becauſe there dwelt ſuch Clerks as did chiefly ſtudy the forming of Writs, which regularly appertain to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:95252:129"/>
the Curſitors that are Officers of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe were heretofore preparatory Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges for younger Students, and many were entred here, before admitted into the Inns of Court.</p>
               <p>Now they are for the moſt part taken up by Atturneys, Sollicitors and Clerks, who have here their Chambers apart, and their Dyet at a very eaſy rate in a Hall, together where they are obliged to appear in grave long Robes, and black round knit Caps. Theſe Colledges belong all to ſome Inns of Court, who ſend yearly ſome of their Barreſters to read to to theſe. In theſe Inns of Chancery one with another, may be about Sixty perſons.</p>
               <p>The Innes of Court were ſo named, as ſome think, becauſe the Students there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are to ſerve the Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or elſe becauſe antiently theſe Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges received onely the Sons of Noble men, and better ſort of Gentlemen, as <hi>Forteſcue</hi> affirmeth.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The two other Inns of Court are <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colns</hi> Inn, belonging anciently to the Earls of <hi>Lincoln</hi>; and <hi>Greys</hi> Inn belonging to the Noble Family of the <hi>Greys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, they ſo flouriſhed, that there were in each of theſe about Two hundred Students, and a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then expended yearly about 20 <hi>l.</hi> Which was as much as Two hundred pounds now; for they had uſually (as the <hi>French</hi> Nobles have now in their Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) every one an old diſcreet Servant, and divers Maſters for to inſtruct them in all laudable qualities; and therefore, ſaith the ſame <hi>Forteſcue, Ultra Studium legum, ſunt quaſi Gymnaſia omnium morum.</hi> And the Students were onely, ſaith he, <hi>Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Filii,</hi> that is, Gentlemen, at leaſt; for ſo the word <hi>Nobilis</hi> was then taken here, and is ſtill in <hi>France:</hi> And therefore by command of King <hi>James,</hi> none were to be admitted into theſe Colledges, but Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen by deſcent. Our Anceſtors thought thoſe of inferior rank, would rather debaſe the honor of the Law, and would be prone
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:95252:130"/>
to <hi>chicane,</hi> or play tricks, and not like to be ſo fit for Truſts and Honors, whereas the conſideration of Birth and Fortune, makes Men more careful of their Honor and Reputation.</p>
               <p>Theſe Societies are no Corporations, nor have any Judicial Power over their Members, but have certain Orders among themſelves, which have, by conſent, the Force of Laws: For lighter offences they are onely excommoned, or put out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, not to eat with the reſt; and for greater offences they loſe their Chambers, and are expelled the Colledge; and being once expelled, they are never received by any of the Three other Societies. Which deprivation of Honor to young generous Spirits, is more grievous then perhaps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of life.</p>
               <p>Theſe alſo, when they meet at Chappel or Hall, or at Courts of Juſtice, wear a grave black-Robe and Cap, at other times walk with Cloak and Sword.</p>
               <p>There are no Lands or Revenues belong to theſe Societies, which being no Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, are not enabled to purchaſe, not have they any thing for defraying the charges of the Houſe, but what is paid at Admittances, and Quit-Rents for their Chambers.</p>
               <p>The whole Company of Gentlemen in each Society, may be divided into Four parts, Benchers, Utter Barriſters, Inner Barriſters, and Students.</p>
               <p>Benchers are the Seniors, to whom is
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95252:130"/>
committed the Government, and ordering of the whole Houſe; and out of theſe, is choſen yearly a Treaſurer, who receiveth, disburſeth, and accounteth for all Moneys belonging to the Houſe.</p>
               <p>Utter Barriſters are ſuch, as, For their Learning and Standing, are called by the Benchers to plead and argue in the Society doubtful Caſes and Queſtions, which are called <hi>Moots</hi> (from meeting the old <hi>Saxon</hi> word for the <hi>French Aſſemble,</hi> or elſe from the <hi>French Mot</hi> a word.) And whileſt they argue the ſaid Caſes, they ſit uttermoſt on the Forms or Benches, which they call the Bar.</p>
               <p>Out of theſe Mootmen are choſen Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the <hi>Inns of Chancery,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> whereof they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; where in Term time, and grand Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations they argue Caſes in the preſence of Attorneys and Clerks.</p>
               <p>All the reſt are accounted Inner Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſters, who for want of Learning or Time, are not to argue in theſe Moots; and yet in a Moot before the Benchers, two of theſe Inner Barriſters ſitting on the ſame Form with the Utter Barriſters, do for their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes recite by heart the pleading of the ſame Moot Caſe in <hi>Law French</hi>; which Pleading is the Declaration, at large, of the ſaid Moot-Caſe; the one taking the part of the Plaintiff, and the other of the Defendant.</p>
               <p>The year alſo amongſt them, is divided into three parts, The Learning Vacation,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95252:131"/>
the Term-times, and the dead or mean Vacation.</p>
               <p>They have two Learning Vacations, <hi>viz.</hi> Lent Vacation, which begins the firſt Monday in <hi>Lent,</hi> and continueth three weeks and three days; and Summer Vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which begins Monday after <hi>Lammas-day,</hi> and continueth alſo three weeks and three days. In theſe Vacations are the greateſt Conferences and Exerciſes of Study in manner following.</p>
               <p>The Benchers appoint the eldeſt Utter Barreſter to read amongſt them openly in the Hall, whereof he hath notice half a year before. He then, the firſt day about eight of the clock makes choice of ſome Act or Statute, whereupon he grounds his whole Reading for that Vacation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares ſuch miſchiefs and inconveniencies as were unprovided before the ſame Act, and now are provided by the ſaid Act, and then reciteth certain Doubts and Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he hath deviſed, that may grow upon the ſaid Statute, and declareth his Judgment therein: After which, one of the younger Utter Barreſters repeateth one Queſtion propounded by the Reader, and doth by way of Argument labor to prove the Readers opinion to be againſt Law; and after him, the Senior Utter Barreſter and Readers, one after another, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Seniority, do declare their Opinions and Judgments in the ſame: And then the Reader, who did put the Caſe, endeavo<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to confute Objections laid againſt him, and to confirm his own Opinion: After which, the Judges and Sergeants, if any be preſent, declare their Opinions; then the youngeſt Utter Barreſter again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſeth another Caſe, which is proſecuted as the former was. And this Exerciſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth daily about Three or four hours.</p>
               <p>Out of thoſe who have read once in the Summer Vacation, and are Benchers, is choſen always one to read in <hi>Lent,</hi> who obſerves the like manner of Reading, as before is expreſſed.</p>

               <p>IN theſe Vacations after Supper in the Hall or, after Drinking on Faſting-nights, the Reader with one or two of the Benchers comes in, to whom one of the Utter Barreſters propounds ſome doubtful Caſe; which being argued by the Benchers, and laſtly, by him that moved the Caſe, the Benchers ſit down on the Bench, at the upper end of the Hall, whence they are called <hi>Benchers:</hi> And upon a Form, in the middle of the Hall, ſit two Inner Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſters; and on both ſides of them, on the ſame Form, ſitteth one Inner Barreſter, who doth in <hi>Law French</hi> declare to the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:95252:132"/>
Benchers (as Sergeants do at the Bar in the Kings Courts to the Judges) ſome kinde of Action; the one being, as it were, retained for the Plaintiff, and the other for the Defendant: Which ended, the two Utter Barreſters argue ſuch Queſtions, as be diſputable within the Caſe. After which, the Benchers do likewiſe declare their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, how they take the Law to be in thoſe Queſtions.</p>
               <p>In theſe Mootings, the Junior always argueth firſt, as is uſed amongſt the Judges in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> and amongſt the Sergeants in open Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Inner and Utter Barreſter plead here in <hi>Law French,</hi> and the Benchers in <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and at the Readings, the Readers Caſes are put in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

               <p>IN the Learning Vacations, each Utter Barreſter, who is a Reader in the <hi>Inns of Chancery,</hi> go with two Students of the ſame Inn of Court, to the Inn of Chancery, where he is appointed to Read, and there meet him commonly two of each Inns of Court, who ſitting as the Benchers do in the Inns of Court at their Moots, they hear and argue his Caſe.</p>
               <p>In the Four <hi>Inns of Chancery</hi> that are ſituated in <hi>Holborn,</hi> the Moots are read,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95252:132"/>
either by thoſe of <hi>Greys</hi> Inne or <hi>Lincolns</hi> Inne, the others by the two Templers.</p>
               <p>In Term time, the only Exerciſes of Learning, is arguing and debating Caſes, after Dinner, and Mooting after Supper, in the ſame manner as in the Vacation time.</p>
               <p>The time between the learning Vacations and Terms, is called the mean Vacation, during which time every day after Dinner, Caſes are argued, as at other times; and after Supper, Mootes are brought in and pleaded by the Inner Barreſters, in the preſence of the Uutter Barreſter, which ſit there in the Room of the Benchers, and argued by them, as the Benchers do in Term time and learning Vacation.</p>

               <head>The Manner of keeping a Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas in any of the Innes of Court, thus.</head>
               <p>THe Students hold a Parlament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and in caſe there be in <hi>London</hi> no Peſtilence, and that the Houſe is furniſhed with ſuch a number of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and of ſuch quality as are meet to keep a ſolemn Chriſtmas; then are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and appointed certain of the Students to be Officers, in imitation of the Kings Court, as Comptroller, Treaſurer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:95252:133"/>
Theſe bear rule in the Houſe during the whole time of Chriſtmas; and are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves in that Port, Gravity, and Authority, as if they were ſo in the Kings Houſe, that ſo hereafter, they may know the better to behave themſelves in caſe they ſhould be promoted to that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: for theſe Gentlemen are uſually of ſuch quality, as come not hither with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to profeſs the Law, but to learn ſo much Law, as may be neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Eſtates, and to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves accompliſht in other qualities, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>At ſuch time, they have here divers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements, as Feaſting every day, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dancing, Muſick which laſt is allowed there to all Comers, and is ſo exceſſive, that what the Dicers allow out of each winning to the Butlers box, uſually amounts to above 50 <hi>l.</hi> a day and night, wherewith, and a ſmall contribution from each Student, are the great charges of the whole Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas defrayed.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, when their publick Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is great, they create a Prince among themſelves, with ſuch Title, as they pleaſe to give him, and he hath all his Officers, and a Court ſutable to a great Prince, and many of the prime Nobility and great Officers of State, are feaſted and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by him with Enterludes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>From <hi>All Saints</hi> day to <hi>Candlemas,</hi> each Houſe uſually hath Revels on Holy-dayes, that is, Muſick and Dancing; and for this

               <p>Note<hi>, that the manner of their Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is briefly thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every Quarter commonly, the Benchers cauſe one of the ſtanding Officers of the Houſe to ſummon a Parlament, which is onely an Aſſembly and Conference of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Utter-Bariſters, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sage Company, and meet in a place called the Parlament Chamber, and there Treat of ſuch matters, as ſhall ſeem expedient for the good ordering of the Houſe, and the Reformation of ſuch things as they ſhall judge meet to be Reformed.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe Innes of Court are moſt wiſely ſituated by our Anceſtors, between the Kings Courts of Judicature, and the moſt opulent City of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Four Innes of Court are reckoned about 800 Students.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there are two more Colledges called Sergeants Inne, where the Common-Law Student, when he is arrived to the higheſt degree, hath his Lodging and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. Theſe are called <hi>Servientes ad Legem,</hi> Sergeants at Law, and are as Doctors in
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:95252:134"/>
the Civil Law, only theſe have heretofore been reputed more Noble and Honourable, <hi>Doctoris enim appellatio eſt Magiſterii, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vientis vero Miniſterii,</hi> and therefore Doctors of Law are allowed to ſit within the Bar in Chairs and covered, whilſt Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants ſtand without the Bar bareheaded, only with Coiffs or Caps on.</p>
               <p>To arrive to this high Degree, take this brief account.</p>
               <p>The young Student in the Common Law, being born of a Gentile Stock, and bred two or three years in the Univerſity, and there chiefly verſed in Logick and Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, both expedient for a Lawyer, and gotten ſome inſight into the Civil Law, and ſome skill in the French Tongue, as well as Latin, he is admitted to be one of the Four Innes of Court, where he is firſt called a Moot man, and after about Seven years ſtudy, is choſen an Utter Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſter, and having then ſpent Twelve years more, and performed the Exerciſes before mentioned, he is choſen a Bencher, and ſome time after a Reader: during the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which heretofore was Three weeks and Three days, the Reader keeps a conſtant and ſumptuous Feaſting, inviting the chief Nobles, Judges, Biſhops, great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Kingdom, and ſometimes the King himſelf (as that moſt accompliſhed Lawyer, the preſent Atturney General did) that it coſts them ſometimes 800 or 1000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:95252:134"/>
Afterward he wears a long Robe, different from other Bariſters, and is then in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to be made a Sergeant at Law, when His Majeſty ſhall pleaſe to call him, which is in this manner.</p>
               <p>When the number of Sergeants is ſmall, the Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas, by the advice and conſent of the other Judges, make choice of Six or Eight, more or leſs, of the moſt Grave and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Innes of Court, and preſents their Names to the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, who ſends by the Kings Writ, to each of them to appear on ſuch a day before the King, to receive the State and Degree of Sergeant at Law; at the appointed time, they being habited in Robes of two colours, <hi>viz.</hi> Brown and Blew; come accompanyed with the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Innes of Court, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a train of Servants and Retainers, in certain peculiar cloth Liveries, to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall,</hi> there in publick take a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oath, and are clothed with certain Robes and Coyfs, without which they may no more be ſeen in publick; after this they feaſt the great perſons of the Nation, in a very magnificent and Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, give Gold Rings to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Blood, Archbiſhops, Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor and Treaſurer, to the value of Forty ſhillings each Ring: to Earles, Biſhops, Rings of Twenty ſhillings: to other great Officers, to Barons, great Prelates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rings of leſs value.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:95252:135"/>Out of theſe are choſen all the Judges of the Kings Bench and Common Pleas, wherefore all thoſe Judges do alwayes wear the white Linnen Coyfe, which is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Badge of a Sergeant, and which he had ever the Priviledge to wear at all times, even in the Kings preſence, and whilſt he ſpake to the King, though anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently it was not permitted to any Subject, to be ſo much as capped in the Preſence of the King of <hi>England,</hi> as at preſent it is not allowed in the preſence of the Pope or of the Emperour.</p>
               <p>When any of the aforementioned Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are wanting, the King by advice of His Council, makes choice of one of theſe Sergeants at Law, to ſupply his place, and conſtitutes him by Letters Patents, Sealed by the Chancellor, who ſitting in the middle of the reſt of the Judges in open Court, by a ſet Speech declares to the Sergeant (that upon this occaſion is brought in) the Kings pleaſure, and to the people, the Kings goodneſs, in providing the Bench with ſuch able honeſt men, as that Juſtice may be done expeditely and impartially to all His Subjects, and then cauſes the ſaid Letters Patents to be read; and being departed, the Chief Juſtice pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the ſaid Sergeant on the Bench, <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> of all the reſt; and having taken his Oath well and truly to ſerve the King and His people in the Office of Juſtice, to take no reward, to do equal and ſpeedy
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95252:135"/>
Juſtice to all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſits himſelf to the Execution of his Charge.</p>
               <p>The Sergeant being thus advanced to be a Judge, hath thereby great Honour, and a very conſiderable Salary, beſides certain perquiſits, for each one hath at leaſt One thouſand pound a year from the King; and now in ſome things, his former habit of a Sergeant is altered, his long Robe and Cap, his Hood and Coif are the ſame, but there is beſides, a Cloak put over him, and cloſed on his right ſhoulder, and inſtead of a <hi>Caputium</hi> lined with Lambskin, now a <hi>Caputium</hi> lined with <hi>Minever,</hi> or <hi>de Minuto vario,</hi> divers ſmall pieces of white rich Furre.</p>
               <p>Note, that to the two Sergeants Innes belong the Twelve Judges, and about Twenty ſix Sergeants.</p>
               <p>Antiently, the Fee expected by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant from his Client for Advice given at his Chamber, or for pleading in any Court of Judicature, was no more then Twenty ſhillings, and the Fee of a Bari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Ten ſhillings, (which yet is much more then is uſually given in any of our neighbour Nations at this day) but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it is become almoſt ordinary, to give ſome Setgeants Ten pound, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Twenty pound, and to a Bariſter, half as much, at the hearing of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Cauſe, whereby it comes to paſs, that ſome Lawyers in one year gain in Fees Three thouſand pounds, and ſome Four thouſand pounds, and in few
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:95252:136"/>
years purchaſe Eſtates fit for Lords, and ſometimes live to ſee themſelves advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be Peers of the Realm, as the late Lord Keepers, <hi>Coventry, Finch,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Now all theſe forementioned Innes or Colledges for the Students in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, being not far diſtant one from another, do make the moſt famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Law that is in the World: and it will be a very difficult thing to find in any one Forreign Univerſity, ſo many Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Law, that are of that ripe age paſt Childhood, and of that high qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, moſt Gentlemen, and a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of the Sons of the higher No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>

               <p>He fitteth alone without any Aſſeſſors, and heareth and determineth all Cauſes, without any Jury of Twelve Men, as is neceſſary in Common Law Courts.</p>
               <p>To this Court belongeth an Actuary, a Regiſter, and a Beadle.</p>
               <p>The Office of the Actuary is to attend the Court, ſet down the Judges Decrees, Regiſter the Acts of the Court, and ſend them in Books to the Regiſtry. This Office is enjoyed by <hi>John Clements,</hi> Batchelor of Laws, and Publick Notary.</p>
               <p>The Regiſter of the Court is another of the ſame name, whoſe Office is by himſelf, or Deputy to attend the Court, receive all Libels or Bills, Allegations and Exhibets, examines all Witneſſes, Files all Sentences, and keeps the Records of the Court.</p>
               <p>The Beadle attends the Court, carrieth a Mace before the Judge, and calls the Perſons cited to appear.</p>

               <p>Nor are they governed by the ſame kind of Laws, for all Members of the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> are ſubject to the Vice-Chancellors Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Courts, which are ruled wholly by the Civil Law.</p>
               <p>Over the <hi>Univerſity,</hi> next under the King, is placed the forementioned Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate called the Chancellor; who is uſually one of the Prime Nobility, and neareſt in favour with the Soveraign Prince, Elected by the Students themſelves in Convocation to continue <hi>durante vita</hi>; whoſe Office is to take care of the Government of the whole <hi>Univerſity</hi>; to maintain the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Priviledges thereof, to call Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, to hear and determine Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,

               <p>This Honour is held by <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Bridgewater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third is the Vice-Chancellor, who is yearly nominated by the Chancellor, and is commonly the Head of ſome Colledge. His Duty is in the Chancellors abſence to do whatever almoſt the Chancellor might do if he were preſent. Moreover he takes care that Sermons, Lectures, Diſputations, and other Exerciſes be performed, that Hereticks, Fanaticks, Nonconformiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be expelled the Univerſity, and the converſe with Students; that the Proctors, and other Officers and publick ſervants of the Univerſity, duly perform their Duty; that Courts be duly called, and Law-ſutes determined without delay; in a word, that whatever is for the Honour and Profit of

               <p>Beſides the fore-mentioned Officers, there are certain publick Servants of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity called Bedels, from the High Dutch <hi>Bitter</hi> or elſe from the Low Dutch <hi>Bidden,</hi> to ſummon, admoniſh, or pray; of theſe there are ſix, whereof three are called Squire Bedels, and carry large Maces of Silver Guilt; the other three are ſtiled Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Bedels, and carry large Silver Maces unguilt.</p>
               <p>Their Office is alwayes to wait on the Vice-Chancellor in Publick, doing what belongs to his place, and at his Command to ſeize any Delinquent, and carry him to Priſon, to ſummon any, to publiſh the calling of Courts or Convocations, to conduct Preachers to Church, or Lecturers to Schools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon more ſolemn times and occaſions there is a ſeventh that carries in his hand a Silver Rod, and is thence called the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who with all the other ſix walk before the Vice-Chancellor, and is ready to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Commands, and to wait on Grand Compounders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Other publick Servants of leſs note, ſhall be paſſed by.</p>
               <p>Many Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been great Favourers of Learning, and eſteemed
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:95252:156"/>
it their honour, to give or enlarge the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Univerſities.</p>
               <p>By Charter of <hi>Edward</hi> 3. the Mayor of <hi>Oxford</hi> is to obey the orders of the Vice-Chancellor, and to be in ſubjection to him.</p>
               <p>The Mayor with the chief Burgeſſes in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and alſo the High-Sheriff of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> every year in a ſolemn manner take an Oath, given by the Vice-chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, to obſerve and conſerve the Rights, Priviledges, and Liberties of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And every year on the day of St. <hi>Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtica,</hi> a certain number of the Principal Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, publickly and ſolemnly do pay each one a Penny, in token of their ſubmiſſion to the Orders and Rights of the Univerſity.</p>
               <p>No Victuals to be taken by the Kings Purveyors within five miles of <hi>Oxford,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the King himſelf comes thither.</p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> of happy memory honoured both Univerſities, with the Priviledge of ſending each two Burgeſſes to Parliament.</p>
               <p>It is none of the leaſt Priviledges belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the two Univerſities, that they are ſubject to the Viſitation or Correction of none but the King, or whom he ſhall pleaſe to Commiſſionate.</p>
               <p>By Charter of <hi>Henry</hi> 4. It is left to the choice of the Vice-Chancellor, whether any Member in the Univerſity there inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, accuſed for Felony or High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhall be tryed by the Laws of the Land, or by the Laws and Cuſtoms of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:95252:156"/>
the Univerſity, though now where life or limb is concerned, the Criminal is left to be tryed by the Laws of the Land.</p>
               <p>No Students of <hi>Oxford</hi> may be ſued at common Law for Debts, Accounts, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, Injuries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but onely in the Court of the Vice-Chancellor, who hath power to determine Cauſes, to impriſon as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, to give corporal puniſhment, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, to ſuſpend, and to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
               <p>Antiently in <hi>Oxford</hi> (as now in moſt Univerſities beyond the Seas) the Students without any diſtinction of Habit, lived in Citizens Houſes, and had meeting places to hear Lectures and diſpute. After that, there were divers Houſes for Students one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to live together in Society (as now in the Innes of Court and of Chancery at <hi>London</hi>) and thoſe places were called either <hi>Inns</hi> from the <hi>Saxon,</hi> or <hi>Hoſtels</hi> from the French, and at preſent are named Halls, where every Student lived wholly upon his own charges, until divers bountiful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of Learning, in their great wiſdom, thought beſt to ſettle for ever, plentiful Revenues in Lands and Houſes, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in Lodging, Dyet, Cloaths, and Books, ſuch Students, as by Merit and Worth, ſhould from time to time be choſen, and to ſettle large Salaries for Profeſſors to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, and for a head to govern them, according to certain Statutes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances made by the ſaid Patrons or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And theſe are called Colledges,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:95252:157"/>
whereof the firſt thus endowed in <hi>Europe,</hi> were <hi>Univerſity, Baliol,</hi> and <hi>Merton</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> all made Colledges in the Twelfth Century after the Birth of Chriſt; although <hi>Univerſity Colledge</hi> hath been reckoned a place for Students ever ſince the year Eight hundred ſeventy two, by the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bounty of our foreſaid <hi>Saxon</hi> King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi> and was anciently called <hi>The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity Colledge,</hi> where were divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and all the Liberal Sciences read.</p>
               <p>Of ſuch endowed Colledges there are in <hi>Oxford</hi> Eighteen, and of Halls, (where, with the like Diſcipline, Students live upon their own means, onely excepting ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Exhibitions or Annual Penſions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to ſome one or two of them) there are ſeven; of all which, the names and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, See the firſt Part of the <hi>Preſent State of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Colledges have within their own Walls, Lectures, Diſputations, all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and Liberal Sciences read and taught, and in ſome of them, Publick Lectures for all Comers, and large Salaries for the Readers; inſomuch, that they ſeem ſo many compleat Univerſities, and are not inferior to ſome of our Neighbor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys. <hi>Lipſius</hi> (whoſe Teſtimony among the learned, is very conſiderable) ſaith of one Colledge of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in his time, what might be ſaid of ſome others there, and in <hi>Cambridge, Non credo in orbe terrarum extra Angliam ſimile eſſe, addam, aut fuiſſe: Magnae illic opes &amp; vectigalia, &amp;c.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:95252:157"/>
Verbo vis dicam, Unum</hi> Oxonienſe <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium (rem inquiſivi) ſuperat vel decem noſtra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole number of Students in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> that partake of the Revenues of the Colledges, are about One thouſand; and of other Students, about twice as many.</p>
               <p>There were anciently in this Univerſity, before the founding of Colledges, Two hundred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Hoſpitia Studioſorum,</hi> Inns, Hoſtels, or Halls; and as <hi>Armachanus</hi> Writes, there were Thirty thouſand Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; and Twenty miles round <hi>Oxford,</hi> were by the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſet apart for Proviſion in Victuals for this City.</p>
               <p>The Diſcipline of theſe Colledges and Halls, is far more exact and excellent then in any Foreign Univerſity.</p>
               <p>Firſt, All that intend to take any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, are to take their Dyet and Lodging, and have a Tutor conſtantly in ſome Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Hall, then they are to perform all Exerciſes, to be ſubject to all Statutes, and to the Head of the Houſe: Next they are to be ſubject to the cheif Magiſtrate of the Univerſity, to perform Publick Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and to be ſubject to the Publick Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes thereof. They are to ſuffer themſelves to be ſhut up by night in their ſeveral Houſes. They are never to be ſeen abroad out of their Chambers, much leſs out of their Colledges, without their Caps and Gowns, (an excellent order, no where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Foreign Parts, but in <hi>Spain.</hi>)
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:95252:158"/>
Their Gowns are all to be black, onely the Sons of the higher Nobility are herein indulged, and all Doctors are honored with Purple, or rather Scarlet Robes, which anciently were allowed onely to Emperors or Kings; but now in <hi>England,</hi> beſides the King, all Peers in Parliament, all Doctors in the Univerſities, all Majors and Governors of Cities, and all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Judges are at certain times cloathed in Scarlet.</p>
               <p>The Degrees taken in the Univerſity are onely two, <hi>viz.</hi> Of <hi>Bachelar</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> (for ſo they are anciently called, as well in Divinity, Law, and Phyſick, as in the Arts.) At preſent, the Degrees in thoſe Three Profeſſions are called <hi>Bachelars</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> onely in the Arts, <hi>Bachelar</hi> and <hi>Maſter:</hi> Yet is it not to be ſuppoſed, That becauſe in Muſick, one of the Liberal Arts, he that takes the ſecond Degree, is uſually now ſtiled a <hi>Doctor,</hi> therefore to be preferred before a <hi>Maſter of Arts,</hi> who is Doctor of all the Liberal Arts; yet Men, otherwiſe Learned, have ſometimes committed ſuch Errors by their Ignorance in words and names.</p>

Comedies, and a mighty concourſe of Strangers, from all parts to their Friends and Relations then compleating their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, whereby, and by the ſet Fees, it uſually coſts a Doctor of Divinity, Law or Phyſick, about One hundred pounds ſterling, and a Maſter of Arts 20 or 30 <hi>l.</hi> ſterling.</p>
               <p>In theſe Three Profeſſions, and in the Arts, there proceed Maſters or Doctors yearly about One hundred and fifty, and every <hi>Lent</hi> about Two hundred Bachelars of Arts.</p>
               <p>The time required by Statute, for ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Univerſity, before the taking of the forementioned Degrees, becauſe it is much longer then what is required in any Foreign Univerſity, ſhall here be ſet down more particularly.</p>
               <p>To take the Degree of <hi>Bachelar in Arts,</hi> is required four years, and three years more for to be <hi>Maſter of Arts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To take the Degree of <hi>Doctor of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> the Student muſt neceſſarily, firſt, have taken the Degree of <hi>Maſter of Arts,</hi> and then after ſeven years more, he is cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of being <hi>Bachelar in Divinity,</hi> and then four years more is requiſite before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Doctor</hi> can be had.</p>
               <p>To take the Degree of <hi>Doctor of Laws,</hi> the more ordinary way is, in three years after <hi>Maſter of Arts,</hi> one may be capable of the Degree of <hi>Bachelar,</hi> and in four years more of <hi>Doctor of Laws,</hi> the like for <hi>Doctor in Phyſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:95252:159"/>The Exerciſes required for taking theſe Degrees are many, and difficult enough, yet not ſuch, but that may be performed in leſs time, by any Men of good abilities: But it was the Wiſdom of our Anceſtors ſo to order, that before thoſe degrees were conferred upon any, and they allowed to practice, they might firſt gain Judgment and Diſcretion, which comes with Time and Years, and perhaps, that thoſe of ſlower parts might, by Time and Induſtry, make themſelves capable of that Honor, as well as thoſe of quicker abilities.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak now particularly of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Schools in <hi>Oxford,</hi> of the large Salary to each Publick Profeſſor, of the moſt famous <hi>Bodlean Library,</hi> that for number of choice Books, curious Manuſcripts, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Languages, liberty of Studying, facility of finding of any Book, equals, if not ſurpaſſes, the famous <hi>Vatican:</hi> To ſpeak of the curious Architecture, and vaſt charges of the New Theater, fabricked by the moſt ingenious Dr. <hi>Chriſtopher Wren,</hi> at the ſole coſt and charges of the moſt Reverend Father in God, <hi>Gilbert,</hi> the preſent Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for the uſe of Scholaſtick Exerciſes, and of that moſt excellent Printing Preſs there. To ſpeak of the beautiful, ſolid Stone Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Chappels, Halls, Libraries, large Revenues, admirable Diſcipline of ſeveral Colledges: To deſcribe the moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Publick Phyſick Garden, abounding with variety of choice Plants, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:95252:159"/>
with ſtately Stone Walls at the ſole expences of the Right Honorable <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> would require an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Volume.</p>
               <p>What hath been ſaid of <hi>Oxford,</hi> the like may be ſaid of Her Siſter <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which for Antiquity, Beautiful Colledges, large Revenues, good Diſcipline, number of Students, plenty of Diet, and of all other things neceſſary for advancement of Learning (if in complaiſance ſhe will at any time give place to <hi>Oxford,</hi> yet at the ſame time) will challenge precedence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other Univerſity of the Chriſtian World.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the two glorious Fountains of Learning, to the fame whereof, Foreigners come on Pilgrimage to offer up Honor and Admiration; and yet, even theſe had lately been like to be dried up, by the over-heated Zeal of ſome ignorant Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the cheifeſt Store-houſes of Lettered Men, which ſends forth yearly a great number of Divines, Civilians, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſerve all parts of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>To ſupply theſe great Store-houſes, there are in ſeveral parts of <hi>England,</hi> Grammar Schools, whereof the principal are <hi>Pauls, Weſtminſter, Wincheſter, Eaton, Merchant-Taylers,</hi> the <hi>Charter-houſe,</hi> all richly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed to maintain Maſters, Uſhers, and a certain number of Scholars; ſo that a childe once admitted into theſe Schools,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:95252:160"/>
if he become capable, may at length be preferred to be Scholar or Fellow in ſome Colledge of one of theſe Univerſities, and will want little or no aſſiſtance from his Parents, all his life time after.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, there are of late Grammar Schools founded and endowed, in almoſt every Market Town of <hi>England,</hi> wherein the children of the Town are onely to be taught <hi>gratis,</hi> without any other allowance. But in the multiplying of theſe Schools, it may be doubted, whether there appeared not more Zeal then Prudence; for the Parents of ſuch School-boys, not able to advance them to the Univerſities, all the reſt, beſides Reading and Writing, becomes uſeleſs; and the Youths, by Eight or ten years lazy living, rendred unapt for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor belonging to the more profitable Plough, and divers Manufactures, uſually turn either Serving-men, or Clerks to Juſtices or Lawyers, whereby they learn much Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canery, they become cunning Petty-foggers, multiply Law-ſutes, and cozen their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; or, if perhaps they are ſet to Trades, that little ſmattering in Learning, got at the Grammar School, renders them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly proud, ſtiff-necked, ſelf-conceited, unapt to be governed, apt to embrace every new Doctrine, Hereſie, Schiſm, Sect, and Faction: Or, in caſe their Parents are able to put them to the Univerſity, yet for want of ſufficient maintenance and reſidence there, they get onely to be half-learned, and thereby a propenſity to Preach Faction,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:95252:160"/>
Sedition, and Rebellion, to ſeduce thoſe that are more ignorant then themſelves, as was evident in our late unhappy troubles, where it was obſerved, that the <hi>Seducers</hi> were generally ſuch as had been from thoſe Market Latin Schools, advanced to be either Commoners or Servitors, for a ſhort time in the Univerſity; and the ſeduced, ordinarily, ſuch as from thoſe Schools be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came afterward Shop-keepers or Petty-foggers. If ſuch had been endowed with more or perhaps with leſs knowledge, they had probably been much more humble, loyal, and obedient, to their Governors, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the late King of <hi>Spain</hi> conſulting with his ableſt Counſellors of State for a general Reformation of Matters that were found, by experience, to be inconvenient and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to His Kingdoms; after mature deliberation, came to this reſolution, That amongſt other abuſes, the great number of Countrey Grammar Schools ſhould by a ſolemn <hi>Prematica</hi> or <hi>Ordnance</hi> be diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the childrens time better employed at Manufactures, Trades, Husbandry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides, upon ſerious conſideration, it will be found that <hi>England</hi> is over-ſtocked with Scholars for the proportion of its Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and for its employments for Letter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſons, whereby it comes to paſs that too many live diſcontented, and longing for Innovations and Changes, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an opportunity to alter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of Church and State.</p>
