            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">Prou. 1.22.</note> 
               <hi>will yee loue ſimplicitie</hi>? the other is oppoſed to craft, guile, fraud, iniuſtice, oppreſſion, and ſuch like vices. And hence it is that plaine dealing men, voide of fraud and deceipt, Maſters of their words, morall honeſt men, in the ſight and appearance of the world, are called ſimple men. So ſhall you reade that <hi>Eſau was a cunning hunter,</hi>

            <p>Now, theſe ſecond ſort of ſimple ones are of two ſorts, <hi>Regenerate,</hi> or <hi>vnregenerate</hi>; the Regenerate may for a time, as it ſhall pleaſe God to trie and proue them, be ſeparated from the Church; yea, in time of perſecution, they may deny that bleſſed name by which they are redeemed,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.70.</note> as <hi>Peter</hi> did, but they ſhall not die in their ſeparation,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> for <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> the <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate</hi> may be deceiued, and deceiued finally,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:26535:20"/>
and by Gods iuſt iudgement periſh in their ſinnes, becauſe they were ſeduced, and opened their hearts to thoſe that cauſed deuiſions and offences, and both theſe ſorts of ſimple ones, as well the regenerate, as vnregenerate, are thoſe that are here noted to be deceiued, by the good words, and faire ſpeeches of ſeducers. For the words are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which words are well tranſlated by <hi>Theodorus Beza, hominum minime malorum</hi>; that is to ſay, men not drowned and plunged in the vſuall ſinnes, and vices of the world.</p>
            <p>And this may teach vs two things. Firſt, that we ioyne not our ſelues to any of thoſe Sects, that are deuided from our Church, which is a member of the true Catholike Church of God, whether <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, Anabaptiſts, Browniſts, Familiſts,</hi> or what elſe you may call them, for that wee obſerue many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Miniſters, endowed with many rare and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable gifts and qualities, to teach their hereſies; for ſuch a one was <hi>Arius</hi> the Hereticke.<note place="margin">Ioaech: Camerat. iuaicat. haereſ. de Ario.</note> And wee can neither depriue our Aduerſaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; nor diuers others, that in other kindes trouble our Church with ſtrange opinions, of that honour, if yet wee may call it honour, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gloriam Heroſtrate,</hi> ſuch honour as <hi>Herostrotus</hi> atchieued by firing the <hi>Epheſians</hi> Temple.

            <p>The leſſe ought we to admire, if they win to bee their diſciples and proſelites, ciuell honeſt men, whom the world, for the moralitie of their liues, holdeth in ſome eſteeme; for ſuch were they whom <hi>Abſolom,</hi> by faire ſpeeches and large promiſes, had drawne to his part againſt the King his father,<note place="margin">2.

               <q>And now to recapitulate what hath beene ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, you muſt remember, that the enemies of the Church and people of God are of two ſorts, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> and <hi>domeſticke,</hi> the firſt are thoſe that make no profeſſion at all of Chriſtianitie, neither will be ſo reputed, as <hi>Iewes, Turkes, Infidells,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:26535:22"/>
the other are thoſe who make profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, and will bee accounted Catholicks and Chriſtians, theſe are of two ſorts, <hi>Heretickes</hi> or <hi>Schiſmatickes,</hi> the one doth cut in ſunder the band of faith; the other doth make a breach in the knot of loue.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Againſt theſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> addreſſing himſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecheth all faithfull men as his brethren to marke them, and to auoide them, vpon this reaſon, that they are moſt dangerous enemies to the ſoule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cauſing deuiſions and offences in the Church, contrary to the doctrine of the Goſpell.</q>

            <p>Vpon which great cauſes (that I may end with application) I am bold to direct my ſpeech firſt to thoſe that are in authoritie,<note place="margin">The duty of Magiſtrates.</note> whom (though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accuſe for former negligence, and euen in my owne conſcience, am confident that they will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcharge their duties in their ſeuerall places with wiſdome and iudgement) yet doe I deſire that they will be pleaſed to let me minde them of it, as ſometimes <hi>Philips</hi> ſeruant minded him of his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:26535:22"/>
God and the King hath committed the Sword vnto them,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.4.</note> which Sword they <hi>beare not in vaine.</hi> Therefore by the power of the ſword com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their truſt, may they marke thoſe that cauſe deuiſions, and offences, contrary to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that wee haue receiued.</p>
            <p>This doctrine is the truth of God,<note place="margin">The doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; the 39. art.</note> taught and deliuered in the bleſſed Scriptures, which that wee might hold with vnanimous conſent, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert from it, it was agreed vpon in certaine Articles in the <hi>Conuocation,</hi> confirmed by the royall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: which Articles are a declaration of what our Church approueth in the moſt principall points concerning ſaith and the publike ſeruice of God.</p>
            <p>Let mee beſeech them to marke thoſe that cauſe deuiſions and offences, contrary to that receiued doctrine.

            <p>For the better effecting of this, let me remember them further, that the old <hi>Aegiptians,</hi> who were not altogether ſottiſh in worldly matters, were wont to paint their Iudges blindfolded, and their Preſident or chiefe Iuſtice without hands, as intimating that Iuſtice ſhould neither ſee the perſon of any man, or feele his reward; which if it be to bee practiſed in matters temporall: how much more in this great

matter, which ſo neerely and meerely concerneth the ſoules of men?</p>
            <p>Secondly, let mee beſeech the Miniſters of the Word (whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> calleth for the worke of their profeſſion,<note place="margin">Mat 9.38. 1 Cor. 4.1.</note>
