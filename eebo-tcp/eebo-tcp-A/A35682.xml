            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THe best things here below are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to be corrupted, and the
better things are in their own natures,
the more mischievous are they if cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
For that which is super lative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good in it self can be corrupted by
nothing but extraordinary malice.
Since then the Stage is acknowledg'd
by its greatest adversaries to be in itself
good, and instrumental to the instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mankind, nothing can be more
unreasonable than to exhort people to
ruin it instead of reforming it, since at
that rate we must think of abolishing
much more important establishments.
Yet that is apparently the design of
Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s Book, tho his malice infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
surpassing his ability, as it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
does, whatever some people
may think of him, his performance is
some what awkward. For in the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb facs="tcp:58549:3"/>
to his Book he gives you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why the Stage in general ought to
be commended; in the first Chapters of
his Book he pretends to shew cause
why the <hi>English</hi> Stage ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
and in the sixth and last Chapter
he pretends to prove by Authority that
no Stage ought to be allow'd. In the
beginning of his Book he produces his
own reasons why the Stage reform'd
ought to be encourag'd, and in the end
of the same Book he brings other mens
opinions to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ew that every Stage ought
to be abolish'd; and so endeavours to
ruine his own Reasons by a long scroll
of other peoples Authorities, which is
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtainly a pleasant condescension;
but such is the fantastick humility of
pedantick pride. And yet Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
is very right and very sincere in his
Reasons, and very wrong and very
corrupt in his Authorities. As if he
were so great an enemy to the truth,
that he would suborn the very dead to
destroy the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rce of what he himself
had asserted.</p>
            <p>If Mr <hi>Collier</hi> had only attack'd the
Corruptions of the Stage, for my own
part I should have been so far from
<pb facs="tcp:58549:3"/>
blaming him, that I should have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
return'd him my thanks: For the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouses are so great, that there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
for the reforming them; not
that I think that with all its corruptions
the Stage has debauch'd the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
I am fully convinc'd it has not,
and I believe I have said enough in the
following treatise to convince the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it. But this is certain, that the
corruptions of the Stage hinder its effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
in the reformation of manners.
For, besides that Vice is contrary to
Virtue, it renders the Stage little and
contemptible; for nothing but Virtue
can make any thing awful and truly
great, and nothing but what is awful
and truly great can be universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected,
and by that means in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to influence the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
For this reason, as I said above,
if Mr <hi>Collier</hi> had only attack'd the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness
of the Stage, in so fair a
manner as he ought to have done it, I
had return'd him my thanks, but when
I found by his last Chapter, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was against the Stage itself I thought
I could not spend a month more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
than in the vindication of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58549:4"/>
My business therefore is a vindication
of the Stage, and not of the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or the abuses of it. And therefore
I have no further meddled with M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Collier</hi>'s Book, than as I have had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to shew, that he has endeavour'd
to make some things pass for abuses, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Stage in general, or of the
<hi>English</hi> Stage particularly, which are so
far from being abuses, that they may be
accounted excellences.</p>
            <p>This little Treatise was conceiv'd,
dispos'd, transcrib'd and printed in a
month; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d tho on that very account
it may not be wholly free from error,
yet this I can assure the Reader, that
I have industriously endeavour'd not
to err, tho I verily believe that Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
industriously endeavour'd to err,
as far as he thought it might be consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
with the deceiving of others.</p>
            <p>The method that I have u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed has
been this: I have endeavoured to shew
that the Stage in general is useful to the
happiness of Mankind, to the welfare
of Government, and the advancement of
Religion: And under the head of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
I have endeavour'd to prove,
that the Stage does not encourage Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<pb facs="tcp:58549:4"/>
as Mr <hi>Collier</hi> asserts in his last
Chapter; and that by encouraging
Pride, which is another thing that he
charges upon it, it provides for the
happiness of particular men, and the
publick. I have endeavour'd to shew
too, in defence of the <hi>English</hi>
Stage, that it is to be commended for its
impartiality, and in exempting no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
or order of men from censure.</p>
            <p>I saw very well that there was no
proceeding any farther in the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it: For no man can make any
reasonable defence, either for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality
or the immodesty, or the
unnecessary wanton prophaneness,
which are too justly charg'd upon it.
But for the particular Gentlemen which
Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has attack'd in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
passages, which he has industriously
cull'd from their writings, I could make
a very good defence for several of em,
if I were not satisfied that they were
abler to defend themselves.</p>
            <p>He has treated them indeed with
the last disdain, and the last contempt,
not considering, that by doing it, he
has treated all at the same rate, who
profess an esteem for them, that is, all
<pb facs="tcp:58549:5"/>
the Town. He has given them some
language which must be resented by
all who profess Humanity.</p>
            <p>For, Mr <hi>Collier</hi> is so far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
shown in his Book, either the
meekness of a true Christian, or the
humility of an exemplary Pastor, that
he has neither the reasoning of a man
of sense in it, nor the style of a polite
man, nor the sincerity of an honest
man, nor the humanity of a Gentleman,
or a man of Letters.</p>

               <head type="sub">That the Stage is instrumental
to the Happiness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</head>
               <p>NOthing can more strongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
any thing to us, than
the assuring us, that it will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
our happiness. For the chief end
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58549:6"/>
and design of man is to make himself
happy. Tis what he constantly has in
his eye, and in order to which, he takes
every step that he makes: In whatever
he does or he does not, he designs to
improve or maintain his happiness. And
'tis by this universal principle, that God
maintains the harmony, and order, and
quiet of the reasonable World. It had
indeed been an inconsistency in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to have made a thinking and
reasoning Creature, that had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
as to misery and happiness;
for God had made such a one only to
disturb the rest, and consequently had
acted against his own design.</p>
               <p>If then I can say enough to convince
the Reader, that the Stage is instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to the happiness of Mankind,
and to his own by consequence, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
that I need say no more to make
him espouse its interest.</p>
               <p>I shall proceed then to the proving
these two things.</p>
               <p>First, That the Stage is instrumental
to the happiness of Mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it is more particularly
instrumental to the happiness of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:58549:6"/>
The Stage is instrumental to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of Mankind in general. And
here it will be necessary to declare what
is meant by happiness, and to proceed
upon that.</p>
               <p>By happiness then, I never could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
any thing else but pleasure;
for I never could have any notion of
happiness, that did not agree with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or any notion of pleasure, that did
not agree with happiness. I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
possibly conceive how any one can
be happy without being pleas'd, or
pleas'd without being happy. 'Tis uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
acknowledg'd by Mankind,
that happiness consists in pleasure, which
is evident from this, that whatever a
man does, whether in spiritual or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
affairs, whether in matters of
profit or diversion, pleasure is at least
the chief and the final motive to it, if
it is not the immediate one. And provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
seems to have sufficiently declar'd,
that pleasure was intended for our
Spring and Fountain of Action, when it
made it the incentive to those very acts,
by which we propagate our kind and
preserve our selves. As if Self-love
without pleasure were insufficient for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58549:7"/>
either; for as I my self have know se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral,
who have chosen rather to dye,
than to go through tedious courses of
Physick; so I make no doubt, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
would have taken the same reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
rather than have supported life
by a perpetual course of eating, which
had differ'd in nothing from a course
of Physick, if eating and pleasure had
not been things inseparable. Now as 'tis
pleasure that obliges man to perserve
himself, it is the very same that has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the force to prevail upon him to his
own destruction. For as Monsieur <hi>Pascal</hi>
observes, the very men who hang, and
who drown themselves are instigated by
the secret pleasure, which they have
from the thought that they shall be
freed from pain.</p>
               <p>Since therefore man, in every thing
that he does proposes pleasure to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
it follows, that in pleasure consists
his happiness. But tho he always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
it, he very often falls short of it,
For pleasure is not in his own power,
since if it were, it would follow from
thence, that happiness were in his
power. The want of which has been
always the complaint of men, both sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58549:7"/>
and secular, in all Ages in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and in all Conditions. <hi>Man that is
born of woman is but of few days, and
full of trouble,</hi> says <hi>Iob</hi> Chap. 14. Verse
1. Of the same nature are the two
complaints of <hi>Horace,</hi> which are so
fine, and so poetical, and so becoming
of the best antiquity.

               <p>In short, they who have made the
most reflections on it, have been the
most satisfy'd of it, and above all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers;
who, by the voluminous
instructions, by the laborious directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which they have left to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
have declar'd themselves sensible,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58549:8"/>
that to be happy is a very difficult
thing.</p>
               <p>And the reason why they of all men
have always found it so difficult is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they always propounded to owe
their happiness to reason, tho one
would think, that experience might
have convinc'd them of the folly of such
a design, because they had seen that
the most thinking and the most reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
had always most complain'd.</p>
               <p>For reason may often afflict us, and
make us miserable, by setting our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence
or our guilt before us; but
that which it generally does, is the
maintaining us in a languishing state of
indifference, which perhaps is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
from pleasure, than that is from
affliction, and which may be said to be
the ordinary state of men.</p>
               <p>It is plain then, that reason by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
us in that state, is an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to our pleasure, which is our
happiness. For to be pleas'd a man
must come out of his ordinary state;
now nothing in this life can bring him
out of it but passion alone, which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
pretends to combat.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:58549:8"/>
Nothing but passion in effect can
please us, which every one may know
by experience: For when any man is
pleas'd, he may find by reflection that
at the same time he is mov'd. The
pleasure that any man meets with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenest
is the pleasure of Sence. Let any
one examine himself in that, and he
will find that the pleasure is owing to
passion; for the pleasure vanishes with
the desire, and is succeeded by loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which is a sort of grief.</p>
               <p>Since nothing but pleasure can make
us happy, it follows that to be very
happy, we must be much pleas'd; and
since nothing but passion can please us,
it follows that to be very much pleas'd
we must be very much mov'd; this
needs no proof, or if it did, experience
would be a very convincing one; since
any one may find when he has a great
deal of pleasure that he is extremely
mov'd.</p>
               <p>And that very height and fulness of
pleasure which we are promis'd in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life, must, we are told, proceed
from passion, or something which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles
passion. At least no man has
so much as pretended that it will be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58549:9"/>
the result of Reason. For we shall then
be deliver'd from these mortal Organs,
and Reason shall then be no more. We
shall then no more have occasion from
premisses to draw conclusions, and a
long train of consequences; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
all spirit and all knowledge, we
shall see things as they are: We shall
lead the glorious life of Angels, a life
exalted above all Reason, a life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of Extasie and Intelligence.</p>
               <p>Thus is it plain that the happiness
both of this life and the other is owing to
passion, and not to reason. But tho
we can never be happy by the force of
Reason, yet while we are in this life
we cannot possibly be happy without
it, or against it. For since man is by
his nature a reasonable creature, to
suppose man happy against Reason, is
to suppose him happy against Nature,
which is absurd and monstrous. We
have shewn, that a man must be pleas'd
to be happy, and must be mov'd to be
pleas'd; and that to please him to a
height, you must move him in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But then the passions must be
rais'd after such a manner as to take
reason along with them. If reason is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58549:9"/>
quite overcome, the pleasure is neither
long, nor sincere, nor safe. For how
many that have been transported be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yound
their reason, have never more
recover'd it. If reason resists, a
mans breast becomes the seat of Civil
War, and the Combat makes him mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
For these passions, which are
in their natures so very troublesome,
are only so because their motions are
always contrary to the motion of the
will; as grief, sorrow, shame and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie.
And that which makes som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
passions in their natures pleasant, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they move with the will, as love,
joy, pity, hope, terror, and sometimes
anger. But this is certain, that no
passion can move in those a full consent
with the will, unless at the same time
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t be approv'd of by the understanding.
And no passion can be allow'd of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the understanding, that is not rais'd
by its true springs, and augmented by
its just degrees. Now in the world it
is so very rare to have our passions thus
rais'd, and so improv'd, that that is the
reason why we are so seldom throughly
and sincerely pleas'd. But in the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
the passions are false and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58549:10"/>
unless they are mov'd by their
true springs, and rais'd by their just
degrees. Thus are they mov'd, thus
are they rais'd in every well writ Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,
till they come to as great a height
as reason can very well bear. Besides,
the very motion has a tendency to the
subjecting them to reason, and the very
raising purges and moderates them.
So that the passions are seldom any
where so pleasing, and no where so
safe as they are in Tragedy. Thus
have I shown, that to be happy is to
be pleas'd, and that to be pleas'd is to
be mov'd in such a manner as is allow'd
of by Reason; I have shown too that
Tragedy moves us thus, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleases us, and conseqeuntly makes us
happy. Which was the thing to he prov'd.</p>

               <p>WE have shown in the former
Chapter, that all happiness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in pleasure, and that all pleasure
proceeds from passion; but that passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

after such a manner, as to move in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

as Philosophers, and the like,
have made most complaints of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of humane life, because they have
endeavour'd to deduce their happiness
from reason, and not from passion.
But another reason may be given, and
that is, that such people, by reason of

the exactness or moroseness of their

it proceeds, that things very rarely
happen in life, to raise their passions in
such a manner, as to approve them to
their understandings, and consequently
to make them move in consent with
their wills. From whence it proceeds,
that splenatick persons are so very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
and so much harder to be
pleas'd than others, which is every day
confirm'd by experience. Indeed 'tis
observ'd every day in splenatick peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that their passions move for the
most part, with a contrary motion to
that of their wills, and so afflict them
them instead of delighting them, Now
there is no Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> as has
been observ'd above a thousand times,
that is so generally addicted to the
Spleen as the <hi>English.</hi> And which is
apparent to any observer, from the
reigning distemper of the Clime, which
is inseparable from the Spleen; from
that gloomy and sullen temper, which
is generally spread through the Nation:
from that natural discontentedness
which makes us fo uneasie to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58549:11"/>
because we are so uneasie to our
selves; and lastly, from our jealousies
and suspicions, which makes us so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
to our selves, and to one another,
and have so often made us dangerous
to the Government, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to our selves. Now the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
being more splenatick than other

to answer all that may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
from Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Book; against
what I have said in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in the behalf of the Stage; I say,
I shall not only endeavour to answer

to reply to all that has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by other adversaries, or that I

               <p>The objections then against what I
have said in Defence of the Stage in the
foregoing Chapters, are or may be of
three sorts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:58549:12"/>
First, Objections from Reason.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From Authority, and</p>
               <p>Thirdly, From Religion.</p>
               <p>First then, I shall endeavour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
what may be objected from
Reason, <hi>viz.</hi> That tho it should be
granted that the Theatre makes peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
happy for the present, yet it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
infallibly makes them miserable:
First, by nourishing and fomenting their
passions; and secondly, by indulging
their vices, and making them Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines:
And that 'tis neither the part of
a prudent man, nor a good Christian,
to make choice of such a momentary
delight, as will be follow'd by so much
affliction.</p>
               <p>And first, say the Adver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aries of the
Stage, the Drama tends to the making
of people unhappy, because it nourishes
and foments those passions, that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>on
the follies and imprudencies from
whence come all their misfortunes:
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd</p>
               <p>First, It indulges Terror and Pity,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd the rest of the passions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:58549:13"/>
Secondly, It not only indulges Love
where it is, but creates it where it is
not.</p>
               <p>First then, say they, it indulges Terror,
Pity, and the rest of the passions. For,
says a certain <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, who
is famous for Criticism, that purgation
which <hi>Aristo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le</hi> mentions is meerly chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical;
the more the passions in any
one are mov'd, the more obnoxious
they are to be mov'd, and the more
unruly they grow.</p>
               <p>But, by Monsieur <hi>De St. Evremont</hi>'s
favour, this is not only to contradict
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> but every mans daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
For every man finds, and every
man of sense particularly, that the
longer he frequents Plays the harder
he is to be pleas'd, that is, the harder
he is to be mov'd; and when any man
of judgment, who has a long time fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
Plays, happens to be very
much touch'd by a Scene, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that that Scene is very well writ,
both for nature and art.</p>
               <p>And indeed, if people who have a
long time frequented Plays are so hard
to be mov'd, to compassion, that a Poet
is oblig'd so to contrive his incidents
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58549:13"/>
and his Characters, that the last shall
be most deplorable, and the first most
proper to move compassion; may it not
be very well suppos'd, that such a one
will not be over obnoxious to feel too
much compassion upon the view of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
which happen every day in the
world, when they and the persons to
whom they happen, may not so much
as once in an Age, have all the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
that are requir'd extreamly to
touch him.</p>
               <p>But, Secondly, whereas it is urg'd,
that the Drama and particularly Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,
manifestly indulges Love where
it is, and creates it where it is not. To
this I answer. That the Love which is
shewn in a Tragedy is lawful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
or it is not. If it is not, why
then in a Play, which is writ as it should
be (for I pretend not to defend the
errours or corruptions of the Stage) it
is shewn unfortunate in the Catastro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe,
which is sufficient to make an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
averse from engaging in the
excesses of that passion. But if the
Love that is shewn is lawful and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
nothing makes a man happier than
that passion. I speak ev'n of that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58549:14"/>
pleasure which attends the
passion itself. And as it certainly makes
him happy for the present, so there is
no passion which puts a man upon things
that make him happier for the future.
For as people have for the most part a
very high opinion of the belov'd ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it makes them endeavour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
worthy of it, and to encrease in
knowledge and virtue; and not only
frequently reclaims them from some
grosser pleasures, of which they were
fond before, but breeds in them an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
detestation of some unnatural vices,
which have been so much in use in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>and,</hi>
for these last thirty years.</p>
               <p>But now we come to the second pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Reason, why the Drama tends
to the making of men unhappy, and that
is, say the Adversaries of the Stage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it encourages and indulges their
vices. To which we answer; that the
Drama; and particulary Tragedy, in its
purity, is so far from having that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that it must of necessity make men
virtuous; First, because it moderates
the passions, whose excesses cause their
vices; Secondly, because it instructs
them in their duties, both by its fable
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58549:14"/>
and by its sentences. But here they
start an objection, which some imagin
a strong one, which is, That the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
has been more corrupted since the
establishment of the Drama, upon the
restoration, than ever it was before. To
which I answer.</p>
               <p>First, That that corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
tho it should be granted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the Stage, can yet only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the licentious abuses of it,
which no man pretends to defend. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, We affirm that this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of manners, cannot be reasonably
said to proceed, no not even from
those pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pable abuses of the Stage,
which we will not pretend to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</p>
               <p>First, For if the corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
proceeded from the abuses of the
Stage, how comes it to pass that we
never heard any complaint of the like
corruption of manners before the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, since it is
plain from Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s Book, that the
Drama flourish'd in the Reign of King
<hi>Iames</hi> I. and flourish'd with the like li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness.
But,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:58549:15"/>
Secondly, if this general corruption
of manners is to be attributed to the
abuses of the Stage, from hence it will
follow, that there should be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
corruption of manners where the
Theatres are most frequented, or most
licentious, which is not true: for in
<hi>France</hi> the Theatres are less licentious
than ours, and yet the corruption of
manners is there as great, if you only
except our drinking, which, as I shall
prove anon, can never proceed from
any encouragement of the Stage. In
<hi>Germany</hi> and in <hi>Italy</hi> the Theatres are
less frequented: for in <hi>Italy</hi> they seldom
have Plays unless in the Carnival, and
in most of the little <hi>German</hi> Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
they have not constant Theatres.
And yet in <hi>Germany</hi> they drink more,
and in <hi>Italy</hi> they are more intemperate
in the use of women and unnatural
vices.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, The corruption of
manners upon the restoration, appear'd
with all the fury of Libertinism, even
before the Play House was re-establisht
and long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>efore it could have any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on manners, so that another cause
of that corruption is to be enquir'd after,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58549:15"/>
than the re-establishment of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
and that can be nothing but that
beastly reformation, which in the time
of the late Civil Wars, was begun at the
Tail instead of the Head and the Heart;
and which opprest and persecuted mens
inclinations, instead of correcting and
converting them, which afterwards
broke out with the same violence, that
a raging fire does upon its first getting
vent. And that which gave it so licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
a vent was, not only the permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but the example of the Court,
which for the most part was just arriv'd
from abroad with the King, where it
had endeavour'd by foreign corruption
to sweeten, or at least to soften ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
and having sojourn'd for a
considerable time, both at <hi>Paris</hi> and
in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> united the spirit of
the <hi>French</hi> W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oring, to the fury of
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Drinking. So that the Poets
who writ immediately after the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
were obliged to humour the
deprav'd tastes of their Audience. For
as an impenitent Sinner that should be
immediately transported to Heaven,
would be incapable of partaking of the
happiness of the place, because his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58549:16"/>
and affections would not be
prepar'd for it, so if the Poets of these
times had writ in a manner purely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive,
without any mixture of lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the Appetites of the Audience
were so far debauch'd, that they would
have judg'd the entertainment insipid,
so that the spirit of Libertinism which
came in with the Court, and for which
the people were so well prepar'd by
the sham-reformation of manners,
caus'd the lewdness of their Plays, and
not the lewdness of Plays the spirit of
Libertinism. For tis ridiculous to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
a cause of so long a standing to
so new, so sudden, and so extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
an effect, when we may assign a cause
so new, so probable, and unheard of
before, as the inclinations of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
returning with violence to their
natural bent, upon the encouragement
and example of a Court, that was
come home with all the corruptions
of a foreign Luxury; so that the sham-reformation
being in a great measure
the cause of that spirit of Libertinism,
which with so much fury came in with
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
down the Play House being part
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58549:16"/>
of that reformation, 'tis evident that
the Corruption of the Nation is so far
from proceeding from the Play-house,
that it partly proceeds from having no
Plays at all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the Corruption of
Manners is not to be attributed to the
licentiousness of the Drama, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
from the consideration of the
reigning vices, I mean those moral
vices which have more immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon mens conduct, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
upon their happiness. And
those are chiefly four.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The love of Women.</item>
                  <item>2. Drinking.</item>
                  <item>3. Gaming.</item>
                  <item>4. Unnatural sins.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For drinking and gaming, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
cannot be reasonably charg'd
upon the Stage, for the following
Reasons.</p>
               <p>First, Because it cannot possibly be
conceiv'd, that so reasonable a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
as the Drama, can encourage
or incline men to so unreasonable a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58549:17"/>
one as gaming, or so brutal a one as
drunkenness.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because these two vices
have been made odious and ridiculous
by our Plays, instead of being shewn
agreeable. As for Dunkenness, to shew
the sinner is sufficient to discredit the
vice; for a Drunkard of necessity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
appears either odious or ridiculous.
And for a Gamester, I never knew any
one shewn in a Play, but either as a
F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ol or a Rascal.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Because those two vices
flourish in places that are too remote, and
in persons that are too abject to be
encourag'd or influenc'd by the Stage.
There is drinking and gaming in the
furthest North and the furthest West,
among Peasants, as well as among Dukes
and Peers. But here perhaps some visio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Zealot will urge, that these two
vices, even these remote places, and these
abject persons proceed from the influence
of that irreligion, which is caus'd by the
corruptions of the Stage, and will with
as much reason and as much modesty
deduce the lewdness which is transacted
in the Tin mines, in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and in the
Coal-pits of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> from the daily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58549:17"/>
of the Pits of the two Play-houses,
as he would derive the brutality
of the high <hi>Dutch</hi> Drinking, from the
prophaneness of our <hi>English</hi> Drama.</p>
               <p>But what will he say then to those
Gentlemen, who neither are suppos'd to
go to our Theatres, nor to converse
much with those who do, nor to be
liable to be corrupted by them; what
will they say to these Gentlemen, if they
can be prov'd to have a considerable
share of the two fore-mention'd vices?
What can they answer? For it would be
ridiculously absurd to reply, that the
Clergy are corrupted by the Laity, whom
it is their business to convert. But here
I think my self oblig'd to declare, that I
by no means design this as a reflection
upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who I am
satisfy'd may morejustly boast of its Clergy,
than any other Church whatsoever; a
Clergy that are equally illustrious for their
Piety and for their Learning, yet may I
venture to affirm, that there are some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, who can never be suppos'd
to have been corrupted by Play-houses,
who yet turn up a Bottle oftner than they
do an Hour-glass, who box about a pair
of Tables with more servour than they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58549:18"/>
do their Cushions, contemplate a pair of
Dice more frequently than the Fathers or
Councels, and meditate and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Hazard, more than they do upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p>And as for that unnatural sin, which
is another growing vice of the Age,
it would be monstrous to urge that it
is in the least encourag'd by the Stage,
for it is either never mention'd there,
or mention'd with the last detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And now lastly, for the Love of
Women, fomented by the Corruption,
and not by the genuine Art of the
Stage; tho the augmenting and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
it cannot be defended, yet it
may be in some measure excus'd.</p>
               <p>1. Because it has more of Nature,
and consequently more Temptation,
and consequently less Malice, than the
preceding three, which the Drama
does not encourage.</p>
               <p>2. Because it has a check upòn the
other Vices, and peculiarly upon that
unnatural sin, in the restraining of
which the happiness of mankind is in
so evident a manner concern'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:58549:18"/>
So that of the four moral reigning
vices, the Stage encourages but one,
which, as it has been prov'd to be the
least of them all, so is it the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous,
and the least universal. For in
the Country, Fornication and Adultery
are seldom heard of, whereas Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
rages in almost every house there:
From all which it appears, how very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
it is, to charge the lewdness of
the times upon the Stage, when it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that of the four reigning moral
vices, the Stage encourages but one, and
that the least of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>our, and the least
universal, and a vice which has a check
upon the other three, and particularl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
upon that amongst them, which is most
opposite and most destructive to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of mankind.</p>

From whence Mr <hi>Collier</hi> makes this
shrewd Remark, that the Theatre is
the properest place in the world to
meet, or to find a Mistress, and that
several people go thither on purpose.
In answer to this, I desire the Reader
to peruse the Verses which precede.
<q>
                     <l>Nec Fuge niliginae Memphitica Templa Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And have we not here a merry person?
who brings an Authority against going
to Theatres, which is as direct against
going to Church? Nay, and upon the
very same account too. But the Poet
speaks here of a Heathen Temple, says
Mr <hi>Collier.</hi> Well, and so he does of a
Heathen Theatre. But what he says
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Theatre is exactly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to ours. And what Reply can be
made to that, says Mr <hi>Collier?</hi> What?
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58549:20"/>
Why I wish to God that no Reply
could be made to it. But besides, if
several people go to our Theatres pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
to meet, or to find out a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
I think it is plain that if there
were no Theatres, they wou'd go to
other places: Especially since, as we
hinted above, when the Theatres are
shut, they frequent other Assemblies
upon the same designs. But tho some
people go to the Theatre to meet their
Mistresses, yet it is evident that most
go to see the Play, who, if they could
not have that diversion, would not
improbably go to other places with far
worse intentions.</p>

for it, by exposing Adu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it the immediate cause of <hi>Olivia</hi>'s
misfortune, in that excellent Play, which
is a most instructive and a most noble
Satyr, upon the hyprocrisie and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Wycherley</hi> being indeed almost the
only man alive, who has made Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
instructive in its Fable; almost all
the rest being contented to instruct by
their characters. But what Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
has said of Mr <hi>Wycherley</hi> is sufficient to
shew us what Candour, nay, and what
Justice we are to expect from this
censurer of the Stage. For in giving
Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi>'s Character, he has shewn
himself invidious and detracting even
in his commendation. For the best
thing that he can afford to say of the
greatest of our Comick Wits, is, that
he is a man of good sense. Which puts
me in mind of a Father in <hi>France</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing

How unworthy was it to commend
Mr <hi>Wycherley</hi> for a thing, which, tho
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58549:21"/>
certainly he has in a very great degree,
yet is common to him with a thousand
more; and to take no notice of those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
qualities which are peculiar
to him alone, his Wit, his Penetration,
his Satyr, his Art, his Characters, and
above all, that incomparable Vivacity,
by which he has happily equall'd the
Ancients, and surpass'd the Moderns?</p>
               <p>But now let us pass to the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
I mean the Philosophers who
were not Poets; for no man can be a
good Poet who is not a Philosopher.
He has cited <hi>Plutarch</hi> in four several
places in his <hi>Symposiaecum;</hi> his Book <hi>De
Audiendis Poetis;</hi> his Treatise <hi>De glori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Atheniensium;</hi> and his <hi>Laconick Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
For the two last we shall say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to them, till we come to speak
of government. In the two first Mr
<hi>Collier</hi> makes <hi>Plutarch</hi> say, that Plays are
dangerous to corrupt young peop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,
and therefore stage-poetry, when it
grows too hardy, and licentious, ought
to be check'd. But I make no doubt
but to make it appear, that Mr <hi>collier</hi>
has been guilty of three things in this
very action, which are unworthy the
Candour of a Gentleman, or of a man of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58549:21"/>
Letters. First, he has brought an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which can only convince us that this
Philosopher did not approve of the
licentiousness of the Stage, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness
we by no means design to
defend: such an Authority, I say, he
has brought in a Chapter, design'd to
shew that the Ancients disapprov'd of
Plays, and the Stage in general. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he has made use of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Plutarch</hi> against the Stage, whereas
that Philosopher has said infinitely more
in its behalf, than he has against it.
Thirdly, he has from two tracts of
<hi>Plutarch</hi> slurr'd one citation upon us,
in the way of an argument, which is
very unlike the reasoning of that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher.
For in the first part of the
Enthyme, he makes <hi>Plutarch</hi> damn
the Stage, and the Drama in general;
and in the second conclude against
them in particular. For Plays, says he,
that is, all Plays, are dangerous to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
young people, and therefore some
Plays ought to be check'd. And why
does Mr <hi>Collier</hi> make the Philosopher
argue after this Jesuitical manner,
when it is plain to any Reader, that
has but common apprehension, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58549:22"/>
since in the second part of the <hi>Euthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene,
Plutarch</hi> condemn'd only some
particular Plays; he only said in the
first part of it, that some particular
Play were dangerous. But let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to <hi>Seneca.</hi> And since it highly
concerns us to give a full and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
account of what is objected
from him, let us cite him at length, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Mr <hi>Collier</hi> translates him. Seneca <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
heartily of the extravagance and
debauchery of the Age: And how forward
people were to improve in that which was
naught. That scarce any body would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themselves to the study of Nature and
Morality, unless when the Play-house was
shut, or the weather foul. That there was
no body to teach Philosophy, because there
was no body to learn it. But that the
Stage had nurseries, and company enough.
This misapplication of Time and Fancy,
made knowledge in so ill a condition.
This was the cause the Hints of Antiquity
were no better pursued; that some inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were sunk, and that some inventions
grew downwards, rather than otherwise.</hi>
To which I answer, First, that it is not
likely that <hi>Seneca</hi> should condemn the
Drama and the Stage in general, since
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58549:22"/>
it is so notoriously known that he writ
Plays himself. Secondly, that by what
he says it is evident that he declaims
only against the abuses of the Theatre;
and those such abuses as have no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ours; as for example, the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
whole days together in the Theatre,
which the <hi>Romans</hi> oftentimes did.
Thirdly, that if Mr <hi>Collier</hi> would infer
from hence, that our Theatres are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
to the advancement of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we have nothing to do but affirm
what all the world must consent to,
that Learning is now at a greater
height than ever it was known in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What we have said is sufficient to
confound Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> but we will not
be contented with that; for here we
triumph, here we insult, here we have
a just occasion to shew the admirable
advantage of the Stage to Letters, and
the incomparable excellency of the
Drama, and in a more peculiar manner
of Tragedy, which seems purposely
form'd and design'd for raising the
mind, and firing it to that noble emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is so absolutely necessary
for the improvement of Arts. This is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58549:23"/>
a truth which is confirm'd by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of all Nations, of all Ages.
For whether we look upon the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
or Moderns, whether we consider
the <hi>Athenians</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> or the <hi>French</hi>
or our selves, we shall find that Arts
and Sciences have for the most part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
but all of them at least begun to
prosper with the Stage, and that as
they have flourish'd, they have at last
declin'd with it. And this we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
not only of the the more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Arts, Poetry, History, Eloquence,
of which the Theatre is certainly the
best School in the world; the School
that form'd in a great measure those
prodigious Disciples, <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenos,</hi>
but we may truly assert it of all
other sorts of Learning.</p>
               <p>For before <hi>Thespis</hi> appear'd in <hi>Attica,</hi>
and reduc'd the Drama to some sort of
form, which had nothing but confusion
before him, they had neither Author
nor Knowledge amongst them, that
could be esteem'd by posterity: That
little knowledge which they had of
Nature is to us ridiculous. For Moral
Philosophy, they had no such thing,
nor Orator nor Historian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But as soon as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58549:23"/>
after <hi>Thespis</hi> their Theatre began to
flourish, all their extraordinary men,
in all these sorts, appear'd almost toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Not only those who adorn'd the
Stage, as <hi>Aeschylus, Euripides,</hi> and the
divine <hi>Sophocles;</hi> but those Orators,
Philosophers and Historians, who have
since been the wonders of all posterity,
<hi>Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, Aristotle, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles,
Thucydides, Demosthenes, Aes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines;</hi>
and of all their famous Authors
who have descended to us, there was
not one that I can think of, but who
was alive between the first appearing of
<hi>Thespis,</hi> and the death of <hi>Sophocles.</hi>
And be it said in a more particular
manner for the honour of the Stage,
that they had no such thing as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Philosophy before the Drama
flourish'd. <hi>Socrates</hi> was the first, who
out of their Theatre began to form
their manners. And be it said, to the
immortal honour of Tragedy, that the
first and greatest of all the Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
not only frequented their
Theatres, but was employ'd in writing
Tragedies.</p>
               <p>And as among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
History, and Philosophy, I
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58549:24"/>
speak of the moral, which is the only
solid certain Philosophy, appear'd and
flourish'd upon the flourishing of the
Stage, so with the Stage they at last
declin'd, for not one of their famous
writers has descended to us, who liv'd
after the Drama was come to perfection,
that is, after the full establishment of
the new Comedy.</p>
               <p>As Dramatick Poetry was the first
kind of writing that appear'd among
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> so I defy the most skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man in antiquity, to name so much
as one Author among the <hi>Romans</hi> till
Dramatick Poetry appear'd at <hi>Rome,</hi>
introduc'd by <hi>Livius Andronicus,</hi> above
five hundred years after the building
of the City. But when their Stage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be cultivated, immediately a
hundred writers arose, in Poetry, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
History, and Philosophy,
whose Fame took an equal flight with
that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles, and who,
transmitting their immortal works to
posterity, continue the living glories of
that Republick, and the only solid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of the <hi>Roman</hi> greatness. As with
the <hi>Roman</hi> Stage the rest of their Arts
were cultivated, and improv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58549:24"/>
as with that in the Age of
<hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> about two hundred
years from the time of <hi>Livius Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi>
they reach'd their utmost height,
so with that they declin'd in the Reigns
of succeeding Emperors.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>French,</hi> 'tis yet scarce a hundred
years since <hi>Hardy</hi> first appear'd among
them: And <hi>Hardy</hi> was the first who
began to reform their Stage, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it from the confusion in which it
lay before him. And tho I cannot say,
that before that time the <hi>French</hi> had
no good writers, yet I may safely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that they had but one, who was

History and Philosophy,
would certainly make a v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry long
and a very illustrious Roll.</p>
               <p>'Tis time to come at last to our
selves: It was first in the Reign of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth that the Drama grew
into form with us: It was establish'd in
the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and
flourish'd in that of King <hi>Iames</hi> the
First. And tho I will not presume to
affirm, that before the Reign of King
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58549:25"/>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth we had no good
Writers, yet I will confidently assert,
that, excepting <hi>Chaucer,</hi> no not in any
sort of Writing whatever, we had not
a first rate Writer. But immediately
upon the establishment of the Drama,
three prodigies of Wit appear'd all at
once, as it were so many Suns to amaze
the learned world. The Reader will
immediately comprehend that I speak
of <hi>Spencer, Bacon</hi> and <hi>Raleigh;</hi> three
mighty geniuses, so extraordinary in
their different ways, that not only
<hi>England</hi> had never seen the like before,
but they almost continue to this very
day, in spight of emulation, in spight
of time, the greatest of our Poets,
Philosophers and Historians.</p>
               <p>From the time of King <hi>Iames</hi> the
First the Drama flourish'd, and the
Arts were cultivated, till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                  </gap>irst; when
the Dramatick Muse was banish'd, and
all the Arts degraded. For what other
sort of Poets flourish'd in those days?
who were the inspir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, the celebrated
men? Why <hi>Withers, Pryn, Vickars,</hi>
Fellows whose verses were laborious
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58549:25"/>
Libels upon the Art and themselves.
These were the first rate Poets, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them flourish'd a herd of Scribblers
of obscurer infamy: Wretches, who
had not desert enough to merit even
contempt; whose works, like aborti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
never beheld the light, stifled in
the dark by their own friends, as so
many scandals upon humane nature, and
lamentable effects of that universal
conspiracy of Fools against Right
Reason. And if any one pretends that
Sir <hi>Iohn Denham,</hi> Sir <hi>William Davenant,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> writ many of
their Verses in the time of the late Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Wars; to him I answer, that what
Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> writ was but very little, and
the other three are notoriously known
to have writ in a Country, where the
Stage and Learning flourish'd. So that
nothing among us that was considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was produc'd in Poetry in the times
of the late Civil Wars, if you except
but the first part of that admirable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
against the Muses mortal foe Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
which yet neither did nor durst
appear till the restoration of the
Drama.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:58549:26"/>
We have seen what the Poets were
that flourish'd in those dismal times,
let us now see what were the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors?
who were the cry'd up Preachers?
why <hi>Calamy, Case, Hugh Peters, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Sibbs.</hi> But what was produc'd in
the other Sciences, that was worthy of
Posterity? what in Philosophy? what
in History? what in Mathematicks?
what could be expected when only hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical
fools were encourag'd, whose
abominable canting was christn'd Gift,
and their dulness Grace.</p>
               <p>But what sort of persons have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
among us since the restoration of
the Drama? Who have been they who
have signaliz'd themselves in the other
kinds of Poetry? So great is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those who have writ politely,
that it is comprehensive of all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men. How many have been
justly Renown'd for Eloquence. So
many extraordinary men have distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
themselves by preaching, that
to ennumerate them would be an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
thing. I shall content my self with
mentioning the late Archbishop and
the present Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> so illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
for their different Talents, the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58549:26"/>
one for his extream politeness, for his
grace and his delicacy, the other for his
nervous force, and both for their mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
purity. Who among us are
fam'd for History? not only the last
of those great Prelates, but the present
Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> whose History of
the Reformation is so deservedly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
by the learned world, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>English</hi> or <hi>French</hi> is known. What
proficients have we in Philosophy? what
in Mathematicks? Let all <hi>Europe</hi> reply,
who has read, and reading admir'd
them. I shall content my self with
mentioning two of the living Glories
of <hi>England,</hi> Mr <hi>Newton</hi> and Mr <hi>Lock,</hi>
the one of which has not his equal in
<hi>Europe,</hi> and neither of them has his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour.</p>
               <p>Thus have I shown you, how Poetry,
Eloquence, History, and Philosophy,
have appear'd, advanc'd, declin'd, and
vanish'd with the Drama, not only in
<hi>Greece</hi> and ancient <hi>Italy,</hi> but in modern
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> So true it is, what
was formerly so well said, that all
those Arts which respect humanity,
have a certain alliance, and a mutual
dependance, and are defended and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58549:27"/>
supported by their common confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</p>
               <p>Thus while I am pleading in defence
of the Stage, I am defending and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
Poetry, the best and the noblest
kind of writing. For all other Writers
are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> made by Precept, and are
form'd by Art; but a Poet prevails by
the force of Nature, is excited by all
that's powerful in Humanity, and is
sometimes by a Spirit not his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
to Divinity.</p>
               <p>For if Poetry in other Countries has
flourish'd with the Stage, and been with
that neglected, what must become of
it here in <hi>England</hi> if the Stage is ruin'd;
for foreign Poets have found their
publick and their private Patrons.
They who excell'd in <hi>Greece</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
by the <hi>Athenian</hi> Stage, nay
and, by all <hi>Greece</hi> assembled at their
<hi>Olympian, Istmean, Nemean, Pythian</hi>
Games. <hi>Rome</hi> had its <hi>Scipios,</hi> its <hi>Caesars,</hi>
and its <hi>Mecenas, France</hi> had its mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
<hi>Richlieu,</hi> and its greater <hi>Lewis,</hi>
but the protection that Poetry has
found in <hi>England,</hi> has been from the
Stage alone. Some few indeed of our
private men have had Souls that have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58549:27"/>
been large enough, and wanted only pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
But of our Princes, how few have had
any taste of Arts; nay, and of them
who had some, have had their Heads
too full, and some their Souls too
narrow.</p>
               <p>As then in maintaining the cause of
the Stage, I am defending Poetry in
general; so in defending that I am
pleading for Eloquence, for History
and Philosophy. I am pleading for the
reasonable pleasures of mankind, the
only harmless, the only cheap, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
universal pleasures; the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Youth, and the delights of
Age, the ornaments of Prosperity, and
the surest Sanctuaries of Adversity, now
insolently attempted by furious zeal too
wretchedly blind to see their beauties,
or discern their innocence. For unless
the Stage be encouraged in <hi>England,</hi>
Poetry cannot subsist; for never was
any man a great Poet, who did not make
it his business as well as pleasure and solely
abandon himself to that. And as Poetry
wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d be crush'd by the ruines of the
Stage; so Eloquence would be misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
maim'd by them; for which, if
action be confess'd the life of it, the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58549:28"/>
Theatre is certainly the best of Schools,
and if action be not the life of it, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi>
was much mistaken.</p>
               <p>In Eloquence I humbly conceive
that the Pulpit is somthing concern'd,
and by consequence in the Stage; and
need not be asham'd to learn from
that place which instructed <hi>Cicero,</hi> and
which form'd <hi>Demosthenes.</hi> For I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forbear declaring, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the extream veneration which I
have for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that
if in some of our Pulpits, we had but
persons that had half the excellence
of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> that had but half the
force of his words, and the resistless
strength of his Reasoning, and but half
his vehement action, we should see quite
another effect of their Sermons. Those
divine Orators fulminating with their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Thunder, would infix terrible
plagues in the souls of sinners, and
rouze and awake to a new life even
those who are dead in sin.</p>
               <p>I now come to answer what is object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Religion; and that is, that
tho it should be granted that some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
happiness may be deriv'd from the
Stage, yet that there is a much better
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58549:28"/>
and surer way to be happy: For the
only way to be solidly and lastingly
happy even in this life, is to be truly
Religious, the best Christian being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the happiest man. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That as the Christian Religion
contains the best, nay, the only means
to bring men to eternal happiness, so
for the making men happy ev'n in this
life, it surpasses all Philosophy; but
yet I confidently assert, that if the Stage
were arriv'd to that degree of purity,
to which in the space of some little
time it may easily be brought, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
our Theatres would advance
Religion, and consequently the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of mankind, and so become a part
of the Christian duty, which I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
when I come to speak of
Religion.</p>

               <head type="sub">That the Stage is useful to
Government.</head>
               <p>SInce in the first part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
we have plainly demonstrated
that the Stage is instrumental to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58549:30"/>
happiness of Mankind, and of <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
more particularly; and since it is
self-evident, that the happiness of those
who are govern'd, is the very end and
design of all regular Government, it
evidently follows, that the Stage which
contributes to the happiness of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
men, is conducive to the good of
the State. However, I shal descend
to shew more particularly, that the
Stage is instrumental to the welfare,</p>
               <p>First, Of Government in general.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of the <hi>English</hi> Government
more particularly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Especially of the present
Government.</p>
               <p>First, The Stage is instrumental to the
welfare of Government in general;
which I shall prove,
<list>
                     <item>1. By Reason: And,</item>
                     <item>2. By Experience.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And first I shall prove by Reason,
that the Stage is instrumental to the
welfare of Government, and that
whether you consider those who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58549:30"/>
or secondly, those who are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</p>
               <p>First, If you consider those who
govern.</p>
               <p>And here it is self-evident, that no
man who governs, can govern amiss,
as long as he follows the dictates of
common Reason. That requires that
all who govern, shou'd consult the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of those who are govern'd, which
is inclusive of their own. And those
Rulers have always been upon a wrong
foundation, who have had an interest
distinct from that of their people.
Male-administration has always its source
from the passions or vices of those who
govern.</p>
               <p>The passions which cause it, are for
the most part Ambition, or the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
love of pleasure. Now as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
checks the first, by shewing the
great ones or the Earth humbled, so it
corrects the last by firing the mind and
raising it to something nobler.</p>
               <p>The vices which cause the Male-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Governours, are either
vices of weakness or of malice, the first
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58549:31"/>
of which cause Governours to neglect,
and the last, to oppress their people.
The vices of weakness are inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and effeminacy, inconstancy, and
irresoluti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n.</p>
               <p>Now nothing can be a better Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
than Tragedy for inconsiderateness,
which reminds men of their duty, and
perpetually instructs them, either by its
fable or by its sentences, and shews
them the ill and the fatal consequences
of irregular administration; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more capable of raising the Soul,
and giving it that greatness, that cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
that force, and that constancy
which are the qualifications that make
men deserve to command others;
which is evident from experience. For
they who in all Countries and in all
Ages have appear'd most to feel the
power of Tragedy, have been the most
deserving and the greatest of men
<hi>Aeschylus</hi> among the <hi>Athenians</hi> was a
great Captain, as well as a Tragick
Poet; and <hi>Sophocles</hi> was both an able
Statesman and a Victorious General. If
we look among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he <hi>Romans,</hi> the very
greatest among them, were particularly
they who appear'd so far touch'd by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58549:31"/>
the Drama, as either to write their
Plays themselves, or to build their
Theatre. Witness <hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Lelius,</hi>
and <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and the Great <hi>Pompey,</hi>
and <hi>Mecenas,</hi> and <hi>Iulius</hi> and <hi>Augustus
Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No man among the <hi>French</hi> has shewn
so much capacity or so much greatness
of mind as <hi>Richlieu;</hi> and no man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them has express'd so much pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for the Drama, which was so great,
that he writ several Plays himself, with
that very hand, which at the same
time was laying the Plan of the <hi>French</hi>
universal Monarchy</p>
               <p>Among us the Drama began to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
and I have been told, that that great
Princess appear'd to be so far charm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That vice of malice which for the
most part causes the male-administration
of Governours is cruelty, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more capable of correcting than
Tragedy, which by diving into the
hidden Springs of Nature, and making

been always found sufficient to soften

               <p>Numerous examples might be
brought of this, but I shall content

Tyrant, as the story is related
by <hi>Dacier,</hi> in the Preface to his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Comment on the Poetick of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle.
This barbarous man, says</hi> Dacier,
<hi>cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that he went out before the end of the

him to be seen to shed tears for the miseries
of</hi> Hecuba, <hi>or the calamities of</hi> Polyxena,
<hi>for him who every day embrued this hands in
the innocent blood of his Subjects. The
truth of it was, that he had some appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
lest he should be so far melted,
that he-should be forsaken by that spirit
of Tyranny, which had so long possess'd
him, and should go a private person out of
that Theatre, into the which he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
a Soveraign. Nay, he had like to
have caus'd the Actor who had mov'd him
thus, to be executed; but the Criminal

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es from an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Historian.</hi> A very grave Writer,
<hi>says</hi> Dacier, makes a reflection which is
very much to my purpose, and which seems
of importance to Government. Speaking
of the inhabitants of <hi>Arcadia, he says,</hi>
that their humanity, and the sweetness of
their tempers, and the respect which they
had for the Gods; and in a word, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their manners, and all their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
proceeded principally from the love
which they had for Musick, which by its
sweetness corrected those ill impressions,
which a raw and unwholesom air, together
with the hardship which they endured by

And if</hi> Polybius, <hi>says he, speaks this in
the behalf of Musick, and accuses</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus

was very unworthy of him, in asserting
that Musick was invented on purpose
for the deceiving of Mankind, what
may we not justly affirm of Tragedy,
of which Musick is but a little orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and which as far transcends it,

the Brutes inarticulate voice, which

               </p>
               <p>But now we come in the second place,
to shew that the Stage is useful to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
with respect to those who
are governed, and that whether you
consider them in relation to those who
govern them, or to one another, or to
the common Enemy.</p>
               <p>If you consider them in relation to
those who govern them, you will find
that Tragedy is very proper to check
the motions, that they may at any time
feel to rebellion or disobedience, by
stopping the very sources of them; for
Tragedy naturally checks their Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by shewing them the great ones of
the Earth humbled, by setting before
their Eyes, to make use of Mr <hi>Colliers</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:58549:33"/>
words, the uncertainty of human
greatness, the sudden turns of State,
and the unhappy conclusion of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and injustice. Tragedy too, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
their apprehension of grievances,
by the delight which it gives them,
discovers the designs of their factious
guides, by opening their eyes, and
instructing them in their duty by the
like examples; and lastly, it dispels
their unreasonable jealousies, for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who are melted or terrified with
the sufferings of the great, which are
set before thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> eyes, are rather apt
to feel a secret pleasure, from the sense
that they have, that they are free from
the like calamities, than to torment
themselves with the vain and uncertain
apprehensions of futurity. But the
Stage is useful to Government in those
who are govern'd, if they are con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
with relation to one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For Tragedy diverts them from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
unjust designs, by the pleasure which
it gives them; since no man as long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
he is easie himself, is in a humour to
disturb others, and by purging th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

passions, whose excesses cause their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
by instructing them in their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58549:34"/>
duty by its fable and by its sentences<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
by raising their minds, and setting them
above injustice, by touching them with
compassion, and making them good
upon a principle of self-love; and
lastly, by terrifying them with setting
before their eyes, the unhappy conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to use Mt <hi>Collier</hi>'s words, of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and injustice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Stage is useful to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
by having an influence over
those who are govern'd, in relation to
the common enemy. For nothing more
raises and exalts their minds, and fires
them with a noble emulation, who
shall best perform their duty: which
brings me to the second Head, the
shewing the usefulness of the Stage to
Government in general, from</p>

more, in which time their Tragedy was
form'd by <hi>Thespis,</hi> cultivated by <hi>Aes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chylus,</hi>
and perfected by <hi>Sophocles;</hi> I
say, it is extreamly remarkable, that
in that space of time, this people,
which before were so inconsiderable,
became illustrious for Arts and Arms,
renown'd for Eloquence, for Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
famous, and for Empire formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the masters of <hi>Greece,</hi> the scourges
of <hi>Asia,</hi> and the Terror of the great
King.</p>
               <p>In that space of time flourish'd most
of their mighty Conquerors, <hi>Cimon,
Aristides, Pericles, Themistocles</hi> and
<hi>Miltiades.</hi> Their Tragick Poets were
the persons who animated their Armies,
and fir'd the souls of those brave men,
who conquer'd at once and dy'd for
their Country, in the Bay of <hi>Salamis,</hi>
and in the Plains of <hi>Marathon;</hi> at which
place a handful of men, as it were, of
the disciples of <hi>Thespis</hi> and the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Poets, vanquish'd the numberless
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58549:35"/>
forces of the East, laid the foundation of
the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, and of the fortune
of the great <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> were highly sensible
of the advantage which the State re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from the Theatre, which they
maintain'd at a publick prodigious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
and a Revenue appropriated to
that peculiar use; and establish'd a
Law, which made the least attempt to
alienate the Fund capital. So that
when the common Exchequer was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted,
<hi>Demosthenes</hi> was oblig'd to use
the utmost address to induce them to
touch and divert this separate Fund.</p>

               </p>
               <p>'Tis not above a hundred years ago,
since Dramatick Poetry begun to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in <hi>France,</hi> since which time the
<hi>French</hi> have not only been remarkably
united, but have advanced their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
so fast, that they have almost

               <p>Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> was the person
who at the same time laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

yet this may be said to the

that our constitution is but ill design'd

               <head type="sub">That the Stage is particularly
useful to the English, and
especially the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</head>
               <p>WE have shewn in the foregoing
Chapter, that the Drama, and
particularly Tragedy, is among other
reasons useful to Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is proper to restrain a people
from rebellion and disobedience, and
to keep them in good correspondence
among themselves: For this reason the
Drama may be said to be instrumental
in a peculiar manner to the welfare of
the <hi>English</hi> Government; because there
is no people on the face of the Earth
so prone to rebellion as the <hi>English,</hi> or
so apt to quarrel among themselves.
And this seems very remarkable, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58549:37"/>
since the Drama began first to flourish
among us, we have been longer at quiet
than ever we were before since the
Conquest; and the only Civil War
which has been amongst us since that
time, is notoriously known to have
been began and carry'd on by those
who had an utter aversion to the Stage;
as on the other side, he who now discovers
so great an aversion to the Stage, has
notoriously done all that lay in his
little power to plunge us in another
Civil War.</p>
               <p>But the Stage is more particularly
instrumental to the welfare of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>English</hi> Government, as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is depending upon two things,
1. The Reformation, and 2. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution.
I shall speak of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
when I come to treat of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
I shall shew at present that the
Stage is advantageous to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as it stands since the Revolution;
and that will appear, if we consider
what people they are who frequent our
Theatres. And they are either friends
to the Government, or enemies, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
persons. They who are friends
to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are for the most part so, because
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58549:37"/>
it defends and maintains the liberties
of the people. But liberty is a jest i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
you take away reasonable pleasure;
for what would signifie liberty, if it
did not make me happier than him
who is not free?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Machiavel</hi> says, in the 19th Chapter
of his <hi>Prince,</hi> that nothing renders a
Prince so odious, as the ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing possession
of the Wives and Estates of his people,
that is, nothing renders him so odious
as the depriving his Subjects of their
lawful and reasonable pleasures; for
no mans Wife or Estate is dear to him
any further than as they contribute to
his pleasure and to his happiness. Now
that the Drama is of the number of
lawful and reasonable pleasures, has
been, and shall be prov'd; and has
been all along implied, not by the
connivance, but by the authority and
the command of so many of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
the protection of so many il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Princes, and the support and
encouragement of so many extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
men, who have compos'd for so long
together the great Council<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whose united judgments ought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

certainly to be preferr'd before the
pretended opinions of two or three
unknown Bigots, who, under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
of their affected grimaces, are
carrying forward their dark designs,
and could never do a thing upon which
they would esteem themselves more,
than upon depriving the Government
of any of its faithful Friends. And it
is more than probable, that some of
its friends would prove averse to it, if
the Stage were either suppress'd or
very much discourag'd. But in the next
place, the Stage is of use to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
if you consider its Enemies;
for it gives the Enemies of the State a
considerable diversion. People will
not so furiously desire a change, as long
as they live agreeably. Men must be
uneasie some way or other in their
manner of living, before they come to
private cabals and plotting. They
who are happy appear averse to them,
and to frequenting Jacobite Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
and to contributing to our non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>swearing
Parsons. <hi>Hinc illae Lachrymae;</hi>
from hence comes the impotent rage
of our foes, from hence their dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58549:38"/>
zeal; for as long as the enemies of
the State are diverted by publick
spectacles, their seditious Preachers
must be in a wretched condition.</p>
               <p>But farther, the Stage is beneficial to
the present Government, if you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a third sort of people who daily
frequent it, and they are such who
are always indifferent what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they live under, so they can live
but agreeably. Now these are of all
others the most addicted to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and would take it most heinously
to be depriv'd of them.</p>
               <p>Thus is the Stage beneficial to the
present Government, if you consider
those who are friends to it, or enemies,
or indifferent. And the same may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
from considering them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For nothing tends to the uniting
men more, than the bringing them fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
together, and the pleasing
them when they are assembled.</p>
               <p>Thus have we shewn, that the Stage
is beneficial to the <hi>English</hi> Government,
and more particularly to the present
Government; and that from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the people, and the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

               <head type="sub">The Objections from Authority
Answer'd.</head>
               <p>WE will begin with the objections
which are brought from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
the Authorities are numerous
which Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has produced in the
last Chapter of his Book; which Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is levell'd against the Stage and
Dramatick Poetry in general, as any
one may see by perusing the first Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.
Now I would fain ask Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
one question, whether the business
of Plays is not to recommend Virtue
and discountenance Vice, and to bring
every thing that is ill under infamy and
neg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ct; whether the Poets, if they
pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, might not be serviceable to this
purpose? And the Stage be very signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant?
What will he say to this? Will
he deny it? Why then did he affirm
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58549:40"/>
it in these very words in his Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his Book? Well, will he confess
it? Then why this pedantick scrowl
of Authorities, to oppose the truth? or
of what significancy is Human Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
against Human Reason? But yet,
to shew the ungenerous temper of this
adversary to Dramatick Poetry, and
consequently to Human Learning, I
shall make it appear, that of all the
Authorities which he has produc'd, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
make in defence of the Stage,
and not one of them makes against it.</p>
               <p>The objections are of two sorts.
Those opinions of particular Statesmen,
and the sentiments of States in general.
We shall answer the Authorities which
are brought from both, in the same
order as they are cited by Mr. <hi>Collier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two first which he brings are
<hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> in the 234th Page,
<hi>Plato,</hi> says Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> has banish'd
Plays from his Commonwealth: But
what can be concluded from thence?
That they ought to be expell'd from
the <hi>English</hi> Government? When every
body knows that the Commonwealth
of <hi>Plato</hi> is a meer Romantick notion,
with which human nature, and human
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58549:40"/>
life, and by consequence Dramatick
Poetry, cannot possibly agree. <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avil</hi>
may give a solid answer to this in
the fifteenth Chapter of his <hi>Prince.
Some men,</hi> says he, <hi>have form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Soveraignties in their own fancies,
such as never were, and as never will be.
But the distance is so very great between
what men are, and between what they ought
to be, that the Statesman who leaves that
which is, to follow that which ought to be,
seeks his own destruction rather than his
preservation. And by consequence, he who
makes profession of being perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ctly good,
among too many others who are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
so, sooner or later must certainly
perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what has thus exasperated <hi>Plato</hi>
against the Drama? Why it raises the
passions, says he, and is by consequence
an Enemy to Morality. But <hi>Aristotle</hi>
who, as Mr <hi>Collier</hi> in this very page
unhappily owns, saw as far into human
nature as any man; <hi>Aristotle</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
that Tragedy, by exciting the
passions purges them, and reduces them
to a just mediocrity, and is by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
a promoter of virtue.</p>

                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:58549:41"/>
As <hi>Plato</hi> has laid the Plan of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

given an account in his <hi>Cyropedia</hi> of a
Romantick Monarchy; in which he
says, that the <hi>Persians</hi> would not suffer
their youth to hear any thing that was
Amorous or Tawdry. But what can
this man mean by bringing this as an
authority against the Stage, and the
Drama in general: For can any one
be so absurd as to imagin, that this
was intended by <hi>Xenophon</hi> to condemn
the gravity, and seve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity, and majesty
of <hi>Euripides</hi>'s Plays? Those Plays which
are said to be in part the productions of
the wisest and most virtuous of all the
Philosophers, of <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s honourd
incomparable Master, <hi>Socrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next, whose Authority is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
is <hi>Aristotle;</hi> produc'd? for
what? why to overthrow the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of that very sort of Writing,
which is establish'd upon his own rules.
Well! And what says <hi>Aristotle!</hi> Why
in his Politicks he lays it down for a
rule, that the Law ought to forbid
young people the seeing of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Such permissions not being safe, till
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58549:41"/>
age and discipline had form'd them
in sobriety, fortify'd their virtue, and
made it as it were proof against De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.
And what are these words
of <hi>Aristotle</hi> cited to shew? Why that
Plays in general are the nurseries of
Vice, the corruption of youth, and
the grievance of the Country,
where they are suffer'd; for that was
the thing which in the first Paragraph
of this sixth Chapter, Mr <hi>Collier</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to shew. Now can any thing
in nature be more unreasonable than
this?</p>
               <p>For in the first place it can never be,
no, not so much as pretended, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
in this place requires the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any thing but only Comedy,
which is but one sort of Dramatick
Poetry; nor can it be so much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that he requires, that this
should be forbidden to any but Boys,
Nor, secondly, is it probable that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
meant this of any thing but only
that sort of ancient Comedy, which
has no resemblance with ours. For I
have two reasons to perswade me, that
<hi>Aristotle</hi> meant this of only the old
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58549:42"/>
and the middle Comedy. The first
reason is, that in all likelihood <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
writ his Politicks while he was
Governour to <hi>Alexander,</hi> which was
before the establishment of the new
Comedy. For <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Morals
commends the reservedness of the new
Comedy, which may appear from Mr
<hi>Collier</hi>'s citation in the 160th page of
this very Book. The second reason is,
That I can hardly believe that <hi>Aristotle</hi>
would have left rules for the writing
of Comedy, if he had believ'd that
Comedy in general is a Corrupter of
Youth. What then <hi>Aristotle</hi> in all
probability meant only of the horrible
licence of the old and middle Comedy,
which yet he requires to be forbidden
only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Boys, is here inplied to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
against Dramatick Poetry in
general; when this very Philosopher
has declared, that nothing is more
proper than Tragedy for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
even of youth, pronouncing
it more grave and more moral than
History, and more instructive than
Philosophy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:58549:42"/>
The next who enters the Lists is <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi>
who, as Mr <hi>Collier</hi> assures us,
crys out upon licentious Plays and
Poems, as the bane of sobriety and wise
thinking, and says, that Comedy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
upon Lewdness. To which I
Answer.</p>
               <p>First, That <hi>Cicero</hi> in this place speaks
only against the corruptions of the
Stage, which corruptions we do not
pretend to defend.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That <hi>Cicero</hi> in his fourth
Book of the <hi>Tusculan</hi> Questions, speaks
only against Comedy, which is but one
sort of Dramatick Poetry, whereas in
the very same place he implicitely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
Tragedy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That even in condemning
of Comedy he is inconsistent with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
And that if the opinion of <hi>Cicero</hi>
is of any validity, it is as valuable <hi>pro</hi>
as <hi>con. Cicero</hi> in his Treatise <hi>De Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citia</hi>

Comedy. For <hi>Lelius,</hi> whom

Livy <hi>and</hi> Valerius Maximus <hi>follow.</hi>
Livy, <hi>he says,</hi> reports the original of
Plays. He tells us, they were brought in
upon the score of Religion, to pacisie the
Gods, and remove a Mortality. But
then he adds, that the motives are good,
when the means are stark naught: That
the Remedy is worse than the Disease,
and the Atonement more infectious than
the Plague. <hi>In answer to which, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
leave to observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, that <hi>Livy</hi> in this place of the
original of Plays, speaks neither of
Tragedy nor of Comedy, nor of the
<hi>Satyri;</hi> which were the third species of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Dramatick Poetry; but
only of the rudeness of the <hi>Ludi Fes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cennini.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That <hi>Livy</hi> commends the
innocence of Plays, in the purity of
their first institution.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That he attributes by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
inference the guilt and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Stage, to things
which can have no relation to our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Theatres. Which is apparent from
his own words. <hi>Inter aliarum parva
principia verum, ludorum quoque prima
origo ponenda est, ut appareret quam ab
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58549:44"/>
sano initio res in hanc vix opulent is
Regnis tolerabilem insani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m venerit. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the small beginnings of other
things, we are obliged to give some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the original of Theatrical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations,
that it may appear how
a thing that was innocent in its institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
grew up to so much licentious
fury, as to render them intolerable
even to the most flourishing States.</hi>
From whence it is evident, that <hi>Livy</hi> in
this place condemns the corruption
neither of Comedy nor Tragedy, but
either the licentiousness of <hi>Liberius</hi>
his Farces, or the barbarity of the fights
of the Gladiators, or the lewdness of
the Pantomimes motions, or all of them
put together. For it is manifest to any
one, who has the least tincture of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Learning, that of the Comedies
and Tragedies which were extant in
<hi>Livy</hi>'s time, those were the purest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which had been writ latest.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I desire leave to observe
here, that the latter half of wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has father'd upon <hi>Livy,</hi> viz.
<hi>that the motives were sometimes good,
when the means were stark naught. That
the Remedy in this case was worse than
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58549:44"/>
the Disease; and the Atonement more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious
than the Plague;</hi> has no manner
of foundation in that Historian. From
all which the Reader may discover the
uncommon Sincerity and Intergrity of
this Censurer of the Stage. Indeed,
without giving my self all this trouble
for the clearing of the business, I might
have left it to any one to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one of <hi>Livy</hi>'s extraordinary sense,
who courted Reputation and the favour
of the publick, could have so little
prudence, or so little good manners,
as to use those expressions which Mr
<hi>Collier</hi> puts in his mouth of the Drama
itself, at the time that it was cherish'd
by the people, supported by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
and esteem'd a considerable
part of their Religious worship.</p>
               <p>Now it is impossible that any thing
could shew less judgment than the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
citation from <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who
blames <hi>Nero,</hi> says Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> for hiring
decay'd Gentlemen for the Stage; for
what does Mr <hi>Collier</hi> conclude from
hence? That <hi>Tacitus</hi> condemn'd the
diversions of the Stage? All that can
be reasonably concluded from it is
this, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> was of opinion that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58549:45"/>
                  <hi>Nero</hi> debas'd the dignity of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Nobility, by enrolling some of their
Rank among an order of men, which
among the <hi>Romans</hi> was reputed infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.
<hi>Tacitus</hi> was too much a States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to say any thing against the Stage,
especially in the condition in which we
are at present. He approves the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Augustus</hi> in the first of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
who after he had got possession
of the Government, honour'd the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Theatre with his presence, not
only out of his own inclination and
complaisance to <hi>Mecenas;</hi> but because
he believ'd that reason of State re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
that he should sometimes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the pleasures of the people.
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> says <hi>Tacitus,</hi> was quite of
another humour. However, he had
too much policy, and too much
good sense, to use his new Subjects
severaly at first, after they had for so long
together liv'd a gentle, voluptuous life.
Thus far goes <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the first of his
Annals, and Monsieur <hi>Amelot</hi> has made
this Remark upon the place: A Prince
in the beginning of his Reign ought not
to alter any of the establish'd Customs,
because the people are very unwilling
to part with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:58549:45"/>
To what <hi>Tacitus</hi> says of the <hi>German</hi>
Women, that they ow'd their Chastity
to their ignorance of these diversions,
this may be answer'd, That first, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<hi>Tacitus</hi> in the right, that can
have no reflection on our modern
Theatres. For the <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies may
very well have been corrupted by the
intolerable lewdness of the Pantomimes,
which lewdness has no relation to us.
Secondly, It has been observd of <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
that he is for referring all things to
Politicks, even things that ought to be
referr'd to Nature, and is for that reason
sometimes out; as it is manifest from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
he is in this case. For the <hi>Germans</hi>
are now as much us'd to Plays as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
or the <hi>Italians.</hi> And yet their
women are much chaster than the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of those two Nations. From
whence it is evident, that the <hi>German</hi>
women owe their Chastity to the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their manners, and to their
want of attraction, and to the coldness
of their constitution.</p>
               <p>In the hurry of my dispatch, I had
almost forgot to return to <hi>Valerius
Maximus; Who,</hi> says Mr <hi>Collier, being
contemporary with</hi> Livy, <hi>gives much the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58549:46"/>
same account of the rise of Theatres at</hi>
Rome. <hi>'Twas Devotion which built them.
And as for the performances of those
places which Mr</hi> Dryden <hi>calls the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
this Author censures as the blemishes
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eace. And which is more, he affirms,
that they were the occasions of civil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions,
and that the State first blush'd,
and then bled for the entertainment. He
concludes, the consequences of Plays intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
and that the</hi> Massilienses <hi>did
well in clearing the Country of them.</hi>
Now here in one citation, Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
has made no less than four or five mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
whether through malice or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
I must leave the Reader to
judge. For in the first place, <hi>Valerius
Maximus</hi> censures neither Comedies
nor. Tragedies as the blemishes of
Peace, and if Mr <hi>Collier</hi> by Theatre
does not mean them, he means
nothing that concerns us. In the next
place he does not affirm, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they or any of the publick Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
were the occasions of civil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions.
In the third place, He does
not affirm that the State either blush'd
or bled for the representation of Plays.
In the fourth place, The refusal of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58549:46"/>
                  <hi>Massilienses</hi> to admit of Dramatical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
can never argue any thing,
not only because the consent of Nations
is against that little State, but because
we cannot conclude from their refusal,
that they did not approve of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That all this may appear, I am oblig'd
to transcribe what he says.</hi> Proximus
militaribus institutis ad urbana castra, id
est Theatra gradus faciendus est, quoniam
haec quoque sepenumero animosas acies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struxerunt,
excogitataque cultus Deorum
&amp; hominum delectationis causa, non sine
aliquo pacis rubore voluptatem &amp; religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
civili sanguine senicorum protentorum
gratiae, macularunt From military instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
let us proceed to our City Camps, that is
to Theatres. For these too have often shewn
mighty Armies drawn up, and being first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for the worship of the Gods, and for the
delights of men, defil'd our Pleasure and our
Religion with the blood of the people.</p>
               <p>Where we may take notice of three
things. 1. That <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
commends the original institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Theatres. 2. That he charges
that which was blameable in them upon
the combats of the Gladiators. Thirdly,
The representation of Plays was so far
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58549:47"/>
from causing civil distractions, that
upon the first representation of the <hi>Ludi
Pescennini,</hi> 390 years after the building
of the City, the Patr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cians and Plebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were quiet for above eight years,
which was more than they had been for
above a hundred years before. And
after the first representation of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Tragedies, which was in the
five hundred and fourteenth year of the
City, there was never any civil dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or at least never but once, till
the sedition of <hi>Tiberius Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>chus,</hi> which
was above an hundred years after. Mr
<hi>Collier</hi> translates <hi>civili sanguine macula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,
caus'd civil distractions,</hi> as if Plays
were the principal cause of the dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
between the Commons and the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians;
whereas those dissentions were
natural to the constitution of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
State, meer necessary consequences
of enlarging their Empire, and by that
means encreasing the number and
force of the Commons, as <hi>Machiavel</hi>
has declared in the sixth Chapter of the
first Book of his discourses.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Massilians,</hi> they will be
better included under the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
which Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has brought
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58549:47"/>
in the second place from States.</p>
               <p>In examining the Authorities which
Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has brought from States, it
will be convenient to say a word to
the proceeding of the <hi>Massilians,</hi> as it
is cited from <hi>Valerius Maximus;</hi> who
commends them for refusing to admit of
Plays among them. But first, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
of this petty state can be of very
small significancy against the consent of
nations. Secondly, This refusal is no
sign of their disesteem of the Drama,
but only of the prudence of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
For expence, and any thing
which looks like magnificence, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to little States, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
subsist without extream fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the</hi> Athenians, says Mr <hi>Collier,</hi>
for which he ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es <hi>Plutarch, thought Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
so unreputable a performance, that
they made a Law that no Iudge
of the</hi> Areopagus <hi>should make one.</hi> To
which we reply, that this citation of
<hi>Plutarch</hi> is absolutely false; and that if
it were true, it could not be so much
as pretended that it concluded against
any thing but Comedy, which is but
one species of Dramatick Poetry; and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58549:48"/>
that in reality it would be of no force
against that.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Plutarch</hi> says, is not that the
<hi>Athenians</hi> made a Law, that none of
the <hi>Areopagi</hi> should make a Comedy;
for one might as well suppose that it
should be enacted by an <hi>English</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that none of the twelve Judges
should write a Farce. That which <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
says is this, that the Council of
<hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eopagus</hi> establish'd a Law, that no man
whatever should make any Comedies.
From whence it is manifest, that this
law was made in the time of the old
Comedy, and long before that came
to any perfection, For Comedy, as is
apparent from <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s treatise of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
was very much discourag'd at
first: Indeed at first they were so
intolerably scandalous, that they were
thought to be prejudicial to the State.
And it was a long time before the
Magistrates could be prevail'd upon to
be at the expence of the Chorus. But
after the Magistrates were at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the Chorus, 'tis absurd to
imagine that a Law should be preferr'd
against the writing that sort of Poem
which was represented at the publick
expence.</p>

So that a Citation which Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
has brought against the Stage in general,
is of no force we see against Tragedy,
nor against the new Comedy, no, nor
so much as against the old one, as it
stood in the time of <hi>Eupolis</hi> and <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes.</hi>
Mr <hi>Collier</hi> brings the words of
his Authors, but leaves us to look for
their Sense, and yet he would take it
very ill to have that return'd upon him,
which he has said of Mr <hi>Durfey,</hi> that
he is at least in his Citations, <hi>vox &amp;
praeterea nihil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he proceeds to the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi>
and says, that they who were remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for the wisdom of their Laws,
the sobriety of their manners, and their
breeding of brave men, would not
endure the Stage in any form, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any regulation. This citation too
is from <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and just of as much
validity against the Stage as the other.
For what can Mr <hi>Collier</hi> conclude from
hence, That the <hi>Spartans</hi> disapprovd
of the Drama? Why then did they
frequent the Theatre while they so
journ'd at <hi>Athens?</hi> As it is plain that
they did, both from the <hi>Cato Major</hi> of
<hi>Cicero,</hi> and from <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:58549:49"/>
Chap. 5. Lib. 4. All that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
from what <hi>Plutarch</hi> says of the
<hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> is, that the Drama was
not so agreeable to the nature of the
<hi>Spartan</hi> Government, it being incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
with rigid poverty, and with
fewness of Subjects, which as <hi>Machiavel</hi>
observes, in the Sixth Chapter of the
first Book of his Discourses, were the two
fundamentals of their constitution.
But then Mr <hi>Collier</hi> may be pleased to
observe, that no sort of Poetry flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
in that Government, nor Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
nor Eloquence, nor written Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.
For as we observed above,
the Arts never flourish'd in any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
where the Drama was decay'd or
discouraged, and in those places where
they have flourish'd, as they have risen
they have sunk with the Stage.</p>
               <p>But tho the Drama was inconsistent
with the nature of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is so remarkably agreeable to
ours, that the Stage with us was never
attempted till the late Civil Wars, and
then too by those who had first broke
in upon our constitution and as it rose
again with the Hierarchy and with the
Monarchy, we have seen it now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58549:49"/>
a second time, by those, who
by their writings and by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
have strenuously endeavour'd to
ruin both Church and State.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next Authority is brought from
the</hi> Romans. <hi>Tully</hi> informs us, <hi>says Mr</hi>
Collier, that their predecessors counted all
Stage-Plays uncreditable and scandalous.
Insomuch that any <hi>Roman</hi> who turn'd
Actor was not only to be degraded, but
likewise as it were disincorporated, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur
aliz'd, by the order of the Censors.</p>
               <p>This, Mr <hi>Collier</hi> tells us, that St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
cites from <hi>Tully</hi> in the fourth
Book <hi>De Repub.;</hi> to which I could easily
answer, that the same St <hi>Austin,</hi> as he
is cited by Mr <hi>Collier</hi> in the 274th page
of his Book, having apparently done
<hi>Tully</hi> wrong in his citation of one of his
Orations which is extant; the passage
which he cites from the fourth Book
<hi>De Republica,</hi> which is not come down
to us, may be very justly suspected.
This, I say, I could easily answer; and
to convince the Reader that I have
very good grounds for it, I think my
felf oblig'd to make it appear, that
St <hi>Austin,</hi> as Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has cited him in
the 274th page of his Book has done
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58549:50"/>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> a great deal of wrong. The
passage is this. <hi>Their own</hi> Tully<hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of the Actor</hi> Roscius <hi>is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
He was so much a Master,</hi> says he,
<hi>that none but himself was worthy to tread
the Stage; and on the other hand, so good
a man, that he was the most unfit person
of the gang to come there.</hi> Now what
will the Reader say, when I make it
appear that <hi>Tully</hi> never said any such
thing? In order to which, I am oblig'd
to transcribe the passage. <hi>Roscius So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium

Has</hi> Roscius <hi>defrauded his friend?
Can he possibly be guilty of this? Who,
by Heavens, (I boldly speak it) has
more sincerity, than he has Art, more
integrity than he has discipline, who, by
the judgment of the</hi> Roman <hi>people, is a
better Man than he is a Player, the
worthiest of all men to tread the Stage,
by reason of his excellent action, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58549:50"/>
the worthiest to partake of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy
by reason of his singular modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I appeal to the Reader, if this
has so much as the least affinity with
Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s meaning? I have all this
while done my utmost to keep my
Temper. But I cannot forbear inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> that Nature did not
make the ferment and rising of the
Blood for Atheism, as he fondly imagins
in the 80th page of his Book. For an
Atheist is a wretched unthinking Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who deserves compassion. No,
Nature made the Ferment of the blood
to rise against those, who are base
enough to defame the dead by suborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to witness what they never
knew nor thought.</p>
               <p>From all which it plainly appears,
that I may deny very justly to answer
to what is cited here from <hi>Cicero,</hi> since
part of it carries in itself such a Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of falsehood; for how could
Plays be accounted scandalous by the
predecessors of <hi>Cicero,</hi> when before the
end of the first <hi>Punick</hi> War, which
was about two hundred years before
<hi>Cicero</hi>'s time, the <hi>Romans</hi> knew nothing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58549:51"/>
of the true Drama; for the Plays which
were represented in the 391 st year of
the City, were the <hi>Ludi Fescennini.</hi> Now
it was not quite a hundred years after
the appearance of <hi>Livius Andronicus,</hi>
who writ the first Plays, that <hi>Scipio</hi> and
<hi>Lelius,</hi> the two greatest men of the
State, whether you consider their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
their courage, or their capacity,
encourag'd and assisted <hi>Terence</hi> in the
writing of his Comedies, and were his
friends by publick profession, which
they would certainly never have been,
if at that time the <hi>Romans</hi> had lookt
upon Plays as scandalous. 'Tis indeed
very true, that the profession of Actor
was not very creditable at <hi>Rome,</hi> but
it does not follow from thence, that
Plays were at all scandalous. Your
common Fidlers are scandalous here,
though Musick is very honourable.
The ancient <hi>Romans</hi> could not esteem
any thing that was Religious scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
Their Plays were a part of their
Religious worship, represented at the
publick expence, and by the care of
the <hi>Aediles Curules,</hi> the Magistrate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who
had the care of the publick worship.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:58549:51"/>
I must confess I have a hundred
times wondered, why Players that
were so much esteem'd at <hi>Athens,</hi>
should have so little credit at <hi>Rome,</hi>
when the Plays had so much, when not
only both Tragedies and Comedies
were a part of their Religious worship,
represented at the expence of the
publick, and by the care of the publick
Magistrates, but when the very persons
who writ'em were carest by their greatest
Statesmen, nay, and when some of the
Poems were written by their greatest
Statesmen themselves.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Livy,</hi> whom Mr <hi>Collier</hi> cites once
again, shall immediately clear my doubt,
for the young <hi>Romans,</hi> says he, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s citation, kept
the <hi>Fabulae Atellanae</hi> to themselves. They
would not suffer this diversion to be
blemish'd by the Stage. For this reason,
says Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> as the Historian ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
the Actors of the <hi>Fabulae Atellanae,</hi>
were neither expell'd their Tribe,
nor refus'd to serve in Arms. Both
which penalties it appears the common
Players lay under.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:58549:52"/>
Here Mr <hi>Collier</hi> seems to me, to have
made a very gross mistake. For he has
interpreted <hi>ab Histrionibus Pollui to
be blemish'd by the Stage,</hi> according to
the noble Latitude which he gives
himself in translating. Whereas it is
very plain from <hi>Horace</hi>'s Art of Poetry,
that the <hi>Fabulae Atellanae</hi> were acted
on the publick Theatre immediately
after the Tragedies.

                  </q>
                  <hi>Dacier</hi> is of opinion too in his Comment
on the 227th verse of <hi>Horace</hi>'s Art of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry,
that the <hi>Fabulae Atellanae</hi> were not
only acted on the publick Stage, but acted
by the same Players that the Tragedies
were, in which he is apparently mistaken;
for in the first place this opinion makes
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58549:52"/>
him inconsistent with himself; as any
one may see, who consults what he
says, upon the 231st verse, where he
affirms, that the Actors of the <hi>Fabulae
Atellanae,</hi> had priviledges beyond what
the common Players had. In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place, the passage which he brings
to prove his opinion, proves nothing
at all. The Passage is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Regali conspectus in auro nuper &amp; ostro,
&amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Dacier</hi> takes to be spoken
of the Players, whereas it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
spoken of the <hi>Persona Dramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
that is, of the God or the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe.</p>
               <p>From what I have said, we may
observe three things.</p>
               <p>First, That the <hi>Fabulae Atellanae</hi> were
acted on the publick Theatre. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That they were not acted by the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedeans
nor the Comedians, tho they
were writ by the Tragick and Comick
Poets. Thirdly, That the Actors of
the <hi>Fabulae Atellanae</hi> were not better
treated than common Actors, because
they did not Act on the publick Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.
<hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> gives us the
reason why they were better treated
in the Fourth Chapter of his Second
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58549:53"/>
Book. <hi>Atellani autem ab oscis acciti

                     </expan> vacuum nota

militaribus stipendis repellitur.</hi> From
whence it is apparent, that it was from
the severity of that sort of Poem, that
the Actors of the <hi>Fabulae Atellanae</hi> were
treated more kindly, than the common
Actors.</p>
               <p>But now how came the Actors of
the <hi>Fabulae Atellanae</hi> to be treated with
so much humanity, on the account of
the severity of those Poems, when the
Tragedians incurr'd the Censorian
note? For Tragedy has infinitely more
severity than the <hi>Fabulae Atellanae</hi> could
ever have. For the <hi>Fabulae Atellanae</hi>
were partly satyrical, and had as great
a mixture of Raillery as have our
Tragi Comedies; whereas Tragedy as
all the world knows is grave and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
throughout. That which follows
seems to me to be the reason of this,
and to be the true cause why at <hi>Rome</hi>
the common Actors were so hardly us'd,
when Plays were so much esteem'd by
the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:58549:53"/>
The first Plays that were represented
by the <hi>Romans</hi> were the <hi>Ludi Fescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nini,</hi>
which were licencious and
scurrilous even at first, and full of
particular scandalous reflections, but in
a little time they grew bloody and
barbarous; and that cruelty of Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to which they arriv'd, was in
all probability the cause why those
who acted in them were so severely
treated by the State. And what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
me to this opinion the more, is
the following passage of <hi>Horace.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Fescennina per hunc inventa Licentia

Not long after these appear'd the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulae
Atellanae;</hi> and because their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
was free from particular reflection,
and their raillery innocent, and because
there was something which was severe
and noble in them; this might prevail
upon the following censors to exempt
the Actors of the <hi>Fabulae Atellanae</hi> from
the censorian note; and might occasion
a Law to be made, that these Actors
should be capable of bearing Arms.</p>
               <p>It was a considerable time after this
before Tragedies and Comedies were
substituted in the room of the <hi>Ludi
Fescennini.</hi> Comedy at first was culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
most, as <hi>Dacier</hi> somewhere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
and it was late before Tragedy
arriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d to its height, tho at the last it
fell infinitely short of the divine subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the <hi>Sophoclean</hi> Tragedy. Now
tho the <hi>Romans</hi> were charm'd with
Tragedy when it was come to its height,
and consequently with those who writ
it, and tho they found it to be without
comparison more grave, more noble,
and more instructive than the <hi>Fabulae
Atellanae</hi> were, yet they might probably
think it below the majesty of the <hi>Roman</hi>
people to abolish an ancient custom,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58549:54"/>
and an establish'd Law of the State, in
favour of the common Players. Yet
this can be of no prejudice to our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Players; because all States have
had unreasonable customs, and this of the
<hi>Romans</hi> may be concluded to be such;
being directly opposite to that of the
<hi>Grecians,</hi> and the <hi>Athenians</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
from whom the <hi>Romans</hi> had their
Laws of the twelve Tables, which were
the most venerable of all their Laws.
What I have already said answers the
<hi>Theodosian</hi> Code, and so I come to that
which he calls our own constitution,
from that which breaks our constitution.</p>
               <p>Neither of the two Statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es, which
he mentions page 242, can reach the
King and the Queens Servants, they
being by no means in the rank of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Players. The Theatre flourish'd
under the Princes in whose Reigns those
Statutes were made, especially in the
Reign of the latter, which may serve
for a proof that the severity of
that Statute extended only to Strowlers.</p>
               <p>All that can be concluded from the
Petition to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which is
mentioned in the same page, is that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58549:55"/>
the Queen thought fit to suppress the
Play-houses that were set up in the City,
tho she allow'd them in other places.
And this was not without a great deal
of Reason: For since the Interest of
<hi>England</hi> is supported by Trade, and
the chief Trade of <hi>England</hi> is carry'd on
by the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> it was not
convenient that the young Citizens
should have a temptation so near them,
that might be an avocation to them
from their affairs. And since it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
from Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s citation, that
the Queen, upon the City's Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance,
supprest the Play-houses which
were set up in the City, but suffer'd
them in other places; this very citation
is a manifest proof of that Queens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of Theatres and Dramatick
Poems.</p>
               <p>That Reader who can expect that I

to be laught at rather than satisfy'd.
And I cannot imagine why these Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettes
should be cited in the same row
with so many Philosophers, Councils
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58549:55"/>
and Fathers, unless Mr <hi>Collier</hi> would

Authority. But 'tis high time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

               <p>The objections against the Stage,

               <p>4. That it exposes the Clergy, and
by endangering Religion endangers
Government. The two first are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and the two last particular objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
I shall speak to them all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly.</p>
               <p>First, The Stage encourages Pride;
a quality that indisposes men for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58549:56"/>
and for the living peaceably.
To which I answer, that if Ambition is
meant by Pride, the Stage is so far
from encouraging that, that it is the
business of Tragedy to deter men from
it, by shewing the great ones of the
Earth humbled. On the other side, if
Pride be made to signifie Vanity, and
Affectation, the child of Vanity, 'tis
the business of Comedy to expose those;
which is sufficiently acknowledg'd by
Mr <hi>Collier</hi> in the Introduction to his
Book. But if by Pride is meant Pride
well regulated, which Philosophers call
Greatness of mind, and which men of
the world call Honour, then I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that the Stage above all things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages
that, and by encouraging it
provides for the happiness of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
men, and for the publick prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>I must confess, if all men were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ans, there would be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for this Philosophical Virtue.
But since that neither is, nor, if we
credit the Scriptures, will be, and since
this very Pride is the Virtue of those
who are not Virtuous, and the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those who are not Religious, I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58549:57"/>
appeal to any sensible Reader, if it is
not to this that he owes in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
his life, his fortune, and all his
happiness. For it is this, which in a
great measure makes his Servant just to
him, his Friend faithful, and his Wife
chaste.</p>
               <p>'Tis this too from whence for the
most part comes the security and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of States. The love of Glory
goads on the conquering Souldier to
his duty, excites the Philosopher, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
the Historian, and inflames the
Poet. So that, in short, from this very
quality, the encouraging which Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s
undistinguishing Pen condemns,
proceed almost all the advantages that
make private men happy, and States
prosperous.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, The Stage encourages
Revenge, which is so destructive to the
happiness of particular men, and to the
publick Peace. To which I answer,
First, that the Stage keeps a man from
revenging little injuries, by raising his
mind above them. Secondly, That if
it does sometimes show its Characters
revenging intolerable injuries, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
punishing enormous crimes,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58549:57"/>
yet by doing that it deters men from
committing such crimes, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
from giving the occasions of
such Revenge: So that we may set the
one against the other. Thirdly, That
perhaps it equally concerns the peace
of mankind, that men should decline
the revenging little injuries which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
every day, and should sometimes
revenge intolerable ones, which very
seldom happen. <hi>Cicero</hi> affirms in his
Oration for <hi>Milo,</hi> that <hi>Milo</hi> had done
a service to the Commonwealth by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of <hi>Cloudius.</hi> From whence it
appears, that that great Statesman
thought that sometimes private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges
might be necessary for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Safety. <hi>Servilius Ahala</hi> did service
to the State by removing of <hi>Spurius
Melius;</hi> and <hi>Scipio Nasica</hi> sav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d it from
utter ruin by the Death of <hi>Tiberius
Gracchus.</hi> Fourthly, That sort of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,
in which the Characters are the
best form'd and the incidents the
best contriv'd to move Compassion and
Terror, has either no Revenge, or by
no menas that sort of Revenge which
can encourage the Crime in others. If
Mr <hi>Collier</hi> had known any thing of a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58549:58"/>
Play, he would have been sensible of
this. If any Reader wants to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of it, I refer him to what I have
cited from <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Poetick in the last
Chapter of the Remarks on <hi>Prince Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur.</hi>
But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Stage exposes the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and so brings a part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
into contempt. This objection
seems to Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> peculiar to the
<hi>English</hi> Stage. For as for <hi>Moliere,</hi> says he,
he pretends to fly his Satyr no higher
than a Marquis. Good God! As if a
Marquis were not above any condition
of men that have been expos'd on the
<hi>English</hi> Stage. This trick that our
Poets have got of exposing quality, is
a liberty, says Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> unpractis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
by the <hi>Latin</hi> Comedians: where, by
Comedians, I suppose, he means Comick
Poets. But it was very common with
the <hi>Greeks, Aristophanes, Cratinus, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>
and all Writers of the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
not only expos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d the chief of
the <hi>Athenian</hi> Nobility, but mention'd
their very names, and produc'd their
very persons by the resemblance of
the Vizors. In imitation of these, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius</hi>
the Inventor of Satyr, as <hi>Horace</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:58549:58"/>
tells us, spar'd none of the <hi>Roman</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
if they deserv'd the lash, no, not
even persons of Consular dignity. And
yet as <hi>Boileau</hi> observes in his discourse
upon Satyr, <hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Lelius,</hi> did not
think this man unworthy of their
friendship, because he had expos'd some
of the scandals to quality, and did not
imagin that they in the least endanger'd
their own Reputation, by abandoning
all the Coxcombs of the Commonwealth
to him. From whence 'tis apparent,
that if the <hi>Roman</hi> Comick Poets did
not bring the Nobility of <hi>Rome</hi> upon
the Stage, it was for want of opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and not of good will. For how
should they bring the <hi>Roman</hi> quality
upon the Stage, when it is plain that
they never laid their Scene in <hi>Rome,</hi>
nor so much as in <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Latin</hi>
Comick Poets translated the <hi>Greeks;</hi>
now the old and the middle Comedy
they could not translate, because the
old Comedy describing particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and the middle one particular
adventures, those Comedies must have
lost most of their graces upon the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre
of another Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. The <hi>Latins</hi>
then translated the new Comedy, in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58549:59"/>
which indeed the <hi>Athenian</hi> Nobility
was never expos'd, because it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
in that way of writing.
For the <hi>Athenians</hi> had no Titles among
them; because those people who were
truly great knew that real greatness
consisted in merit and virtue; but when
that real greatness forsook the world,
a titular greatness, the shadow of the
other, was introduced to supply it; a
meer invention to cajole people, and
perswade them that they might be
noble without Virtue. Now the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
having no Titles, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how the <hi>Athenian</hi> Nobility could
be possibly expos'd by <hi>Menander,</hi> or
any of the Writers of the new Comedy.
For, to set the mark of Quality on any
one of their Characters, there was either
a necessity of mentioning his name, or
describing his person, or his particular
employment in the State; the doing
which would have thrown them back
upon the old or middle Comedy, which
were both forbid by the Law. From
all which it appears, that the <hi>Romans</hi>
in this case are not against us, and the
<hi>French</hi> are clearly on our sides. But to
come to the reason of the thing, if a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58549:59"/>
Lord may not be shewn a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ool upon
the Stage, I would fain ask Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
what Fools a Comick Poet may lawfully
show there, and at what condition of
men he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is oblig'd to stop. I would fain
know whether a Poet may be allow'd
to Dub his Dramatical Coxcombs?
May he show a Fool a Knight Baronet,
or a Knight Batchelour, or are they
too included in Quality? Must he be
oblig'd to go no further than Squire,
and must Fool and Squire continue to
be terms synonimous? If any of Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s
acquaintance will give himself the
diversion of asking him these questions,
I dare engage that he will find him em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barass'd
sufficiently.</p>
               <p>But methinks neither the Lords nor
we are oblig'd to Mr <hi>Collier</hi> for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
civility. For if a Lord is
capable of committing extravagancies as
well as another man, why should Mr
<hi>Collier</hi> endeavour to perswade him that
he is above it? or why should he hinder
him from being reclaim'd? unless he
would imply that a Commoner may be
corrected when he grows extravagant,
but that when a Lord grows fantastick
he is altogether incorrigible. Nor are
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58549:60"/>
we oblig'd to Mr <hi>Collier</hi> any more than
the Peers are? For since the bare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of their conditions makes some
of them already grow almost insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
why should any one endeavour
to add to their vanity, by exempting
them from common censure?</p>
               <p>Besides, since follies ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
the follies of the great are
the fittest, as being most conspicuous
and most contageous. The follies of
the meaner sort are often the effects of
ignorance, and merit compassion rather
than contempt. Affected follies are the
most despicable; now Affectation is the
child of Vanity, and Vanity of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But why should a Lord be free from
Dramatical censure, when he can be
corrected no where but upon the Stage?
A Commoner may be corrected in
company, but such friendly admonition
to a Lord may be interpreted Scandal.</p>
               <p>For our Comick Poets, I dare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
that no men respect our Nobility
more than they do: They know very
well that their titles illustrate their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and adorn their virtue; but that
those whom they expose, are such
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58549:60"/>
whose Follies and whose Vices render
their Titles ridiculous. And yet that
they expose them no more than the rest
of the Kings Subjects: For Folly as well
as Vice is personal, and the Satyr of
Comedy falls not upon the order of
men, out of which the Ridiculous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
are taken, but upon the persons
of all orders who are affected with the
like follies.</p>
               <p>For they know further what Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
apparently never knew, that a Lord
in effect in a Comedy signifies any man.
For the Characters of Comedy are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
at bottom universal and allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:
And the making Lords of their
Comick Fools, can signifie no more than
to admonish our men of Quality that
they are concern'd in the instruction as
well as others.</p>
               <p>The fourth objection from Reason is,
That the Stage exposes the Clergy, and
so by endangering Religion endangers
Government. But of this I shall speak
in the following part of this Book,
where I design to treat of Religion.</p>
               <p>We now come to answer what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
from Religion, which is, That
there is no need of the Stage to make
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58549:61"/>
people good Subjects; for that the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
teaches men their duty to their
Prince, better than all the Philosophy
and all the Poetry in the world. 'Tis
indeed undeniable. But the validity of
this objection depends upon two suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions;
which are, that all the Subjects
of the State go to Church, and that all
attend when they are there. Whereas
it is manifest that our Atheists and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists
seldom go thither; and that our
doubting, cold, and lukewarm Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
seldom attend when they are there.
But that the Stage, reduc'd to its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
purity, would be a means to send
them thither, and the best of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
preparatives for the Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
which they would find there,
is designed to be shown in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part of this Treatise.</p>

               <p>I Now come to shew that the Stage
is useful to the advancement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58549:62"/>
And, First, Of the Christian
Religion in general. Secondly, Of the
Christian Religion particularly, and
more especially of the Reform'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Religion in general, or natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
may be consider'd as consisting of
two parts; the things to be believed,
and the things to be done.</p>
               <p>First, The things to be believed, are
1. The being of a God. 2. Providence.
3. Immortality of the Soul. 4. Future
Rewards and Punishments. The Poet,
and particularly the Tragick Poet, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
all these, and these are the very
foundations of his Art; for in the first
place the Machines are the very life
and soul of Poetry; now the Machines
would be absurd and ridiculous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the belief of a God, and a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Providence. In the second place,
let any man shew me where Terror is
mov'd to a heighth, and I will shew
him that that place requires the belief
of a God and particular Providence.
In the third place, Poetick Iustice would
be a j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st if it were not an Image of the
Divine, and if it did not consequently
suppose the being of a God and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58549:62"/>
It supposes too the immortality
of the Soul, and future rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.
For the things which in
perfect Tragedy bring men into fatal
calamities are involuntary faults; that
is, faults occasion'd by great passions.
Now this upon a supposition of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
state, is very just and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.
For since passions in their
excesses, are the causes of most
of the disturbances that happen in the
world, upon a supposition of a future
state, nothing can be more just, than
that the power which governs the
world, should make sometimes very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
examples of those who indulge
their passions; providence seems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
this. But then to make invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
faults capital, and to punish
them with the last punishment, would
not be so consistent with the goodness
of God, unless there were a compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hereafter. For such a punishment
would not only be too rigorous, but
cruel and extravagant.</p>
               <p>The second part of natural Religion
contains the things which are to be
done; which include,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58549:63"/>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Our duty to God.</item>
                     <item>2. Our duty to our Neighbour.</item>
                     <item>3. Our duty to our selves.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And all these it is the business of
Tragedy to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

From which it appears, that it was the
business of Tragedy to exhort men to
Piety and the worship of the Gods;
to perswade them to Justice, to Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and to Fidelity, and to incline
them to moderation and temperance.
And 'tis for the omission of one of these
duties that the persons of the modern
Tragedy are shewn unfortunate in their
Catastrophes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:58549:63"/>
Thus <hi>Don Iohn</hi> is destroy'd for
his libertinism and his impiety; <hi>Timon</hi>
for his profusion and his intemperance;
<hi>Macbeth</hi> for his lawless ambition and
cruelty; <hi>Castalio</hi> for his falshood to his
Brother and Friend; <hi>Iaffeir</hi> for his
clandestine Marriage with the Daughter
of his Benefactor; and <hi>Belvidera</hi> for her
disobedience.</p>
               <p>Thus we have shewn, by reason and by
matter of fact, that it is the business
of the Stage to advance Religion, and
it is plain from History and from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that Religion ha flourish'd with
the Stage; and that the <hi>Athenians</hi> and
<hi>Romans</hi> who most encourag'd it, were
the most religious people in the world.
And, perhaps, if we would come down
to our selves, it would be no difficult
matter to shew, that they who frequent
our Theatres, have a great deal more
of natural Religion in them, than its
declared inveterate Enemies, who are
principally Fanaticks and Jesuits: for
the Vices which are charg'd upon the
friends of the Stage, are for the most
part the effects of frailty, and meer
human Vices; whereas the faults of its
inveterate Enemies, are known to be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58549:64"/>
diabolical crimes, destructive of Society,
of Peace, and of human Happiness;
such as falshood, slander, injustice,
back-biting, perfidiousness, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
hatred.</p>
               <p>I now come to shew in the second
place that the Stage is useful for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
the Christian, and particularly
the Reformed Religion. The Christian
Religion has two parts, the Moral and
the Mysterious. The Moral consists of
Human and Christian Virtues: The
Human Virtues are a part of Natural
Religion, which, since the Stage ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
as we have shewn above, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that it partly advances Christianity.
The Stage too in some measure may be
made to recommend Humility, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Meekness to us, which are
true Christian Virtues: And tho a
Dramatick Poet neither can nor ought
to teach the Mysteries of the Christian
Religion, yet by recommending the
Human and the Christian Virtues to the
practice of our Audience, he admirably
prepares men for the belief of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.
For this is undeniable, that it
is not Reason, but Passion and Vice that
keeps any man from being a Christian.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58549:64"/>
That therefore that moderates our
Passions, and instructs us in our Duty,
must consequently advance our Faith.
So that the Stage is not only absolutely
necessary for the instructing and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manizing
those who are not Christians,
but the best of all human things to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them for the sublimer Doctrines of
the Church. Now that which inclines
us to the Christian Religion will incline
us to the purer sort of it, and that which
has the least affinity with Idolatry, which
is the Reform'd Religion. That which
opens men's eyes as the Stage does, by
purging our passions and instructing us
in our duty; and that which raises
their minds, will make them naturally
averse from superstitious foppery, and

Enemies to Plays. This is remarkable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
the Church and the Hierarchy, ever since
the Reformation, have flourish'd with
the Stage, were depos'd with it, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58549:65"/>
restor'd with it. Thus have I shewn
that the Stage advances Religion, and
more particularly the Christian Reform'd
Religion. I come now to answer what
may be objected from Reason and from
Authority.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Objections from Reason
Answer'd.</head>
               <p>THe objections from Reason are
chiefly three. That the Stage makes
its Characters sometimes talk prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l;
that it encourages Pride, that it
exposes Religion in the Priesthood.
These are so easily answer'd, that I
shall dispatch them in a few words, and
come to the objections from Authority.</p>
               <p>First, The Stage sometimes makes its
Characters talk prophanely. To which
I answer; That if the Character which
speaks is well mark'd and the prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be necessary for the Fable and for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58549:65"/>
the Action, then the prophaness is not
unjustifiable: for to assert the contrary,
would be to affirm, that is is unlawful
for a Dramatick Poet to write against
prophaneness, which is ridiculous. A Poet
has no other way in the Drama of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an Audience an aversion for any
Vice, than by exposing or punishing it
in the persons of the Drama. And here
I think my self obliged to reply to
something that Mr <hi>Colller</hi> has asserted,
in his Remarks upon Mr <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>King
Arthur,</hi> which is, that they who bring
Devils on the Stage, can hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them any whereelse. But why for
Godsake? for a man of sense always
reasons, but the Pedant asserts dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically.
Did <hi>Aeschilus</hi> in bringing the
Furies upon the Stage of <hi>Athens,</hi> shew
that he thought they were nothing but
a poetical sham? Why should it be more
irrelig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on in us to bring Devils on the
Stage, that it was to bring Furies in
him? Can any thing be more terrible,
than the shewing of Devils, if they are
shewn solemnly? And can any thing
that moves Terror, do a disservice to
Religion?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:58549:66"/>
But, Secondly, The Stage encourages
Pride. Indeed, I must confess, that even the
best sort of Pride, which some call
honour, and others greatness of mind,
is not so very consistent with some of
the Christian virtues. But then I do
not affirm that the Stage can be at all
useful for the instruction of those who
are arrived at any more perfect state
of Religion; but for those who are
not, that is, for the generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
greatness of mind may be very ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable,
for the assisting them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
their passions, and the restraining
them from committing enormous crimes.</p>
               <p>But, Thirdly, The Stage exposes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
by exposing the Priesthood.
To which I answer, That to talk of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Religion is Cant; for to expose
Religion is to expose Truth, which is
absurd; because nothing can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
but that which is false. If the
Stage really ridicul'd Religion, instead
of ridiculing Hypocrisie, some people,
whose Religion lies in their Muscles,
would be more easily reconciled to it.
For how many Books have been print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>English</hi> that have been levell'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
against Religion itself? For what
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58549:66"/>
reason then have none of those Zealots,
who have declaim'd with so much fury
against the Stage, writ any thing to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
people from reading those Deisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al
and Atheistical Treatises? For what
reason have they omitted this, unless
because those Books only attack Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
about which they never much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
their heads; but the Poets attack
them. The bringing a vicious or a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Priest upon the Stage then cannot
be interpreted the exposing Religion,
but the ridiculing Hypocrisie. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
this is very certain, that no Poet
ought to shew a Priest in such a manner
as to shew any disesteem of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
But I cannot for my life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
why the bringing a foolish or a
vicious Priest upon the Stage should be
such an abominable thing.</p>
               <p>For, since persons of all degrees,
from Monarch to Peasant, are daily
brought upon the Stage, why should
the Clergy be exempted? The Clergy
have been treated by our Comick Poets
with a great deal more respect than the
Laity: Because they have hardly spar'd
any condition of the Laity, but none of
the superiour Clergy have been ever
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58549:67"/>
expos'd in our Comedies; which is one
sign of the good intention of the Poets,
and that they only show the Follies and
Vices of some, while they reverence
the Piety and Learning of others, and
the order in general.</p>
               <p>And whereas Mr <hi>Collier</hi> affirms, that
foreign States suffer no Priests to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
on the Comick Stage. To that
we answer, That in Countries where the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is establish'd they have
some reason to use this niceness: For
prudence requires that the Magistrate
should always take care of the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Religion, and the established Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in those Countries being almost all
Priestcraft, to expose the Priests is there
to expose Religion. Besides, in those
places Priestcraft and Secular Policy
have a nearer alliance, and a closer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on each other by much, than
they have here: for the Priests are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably
assistant to the Magistrates in
the enslaving the people, Besides, in
<hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> the Inquisition rages,
and Priests will be sure to take care of
themselves. As for <hi>France,</hi> tho they
never had a Priest upon the Stage, yet
they have a Poem which was writ on
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58549:67"/>
purpose to ridicule even the superiour
Clergy. And by whom was it writ?
By Monsieur <hi>Boileau,</hi> the most sober
and most religious of all their Poets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Who advis'd it? Who commanded it?
Monsieur <hi>De Lamoignon,</hi> illustrious for
his profound Capacity, renown'd for
his Learning, and fam'd for his Piety;
who believ'd that the exposing that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigious
humour that was crept into the
Regular Clergy, might do important
service to the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. And
why should our Magistrates make any
exception against the exposing the faults
of the Clergy here, where the Religion
is so pure, that to touch a Priest is by
no means to hurt the Religion.</p>
               <p>And whereas Mr <hi>Collier</hi> says, that to
affront a Priest is to affront the Deity;
so it is to a affront a Peasant who is a
good Christian; besides, affronts are
always personal, but a Priest in a Play
is a general Character; and the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an ill or a ridiculous one upon the
Stage, rather proceeds from our vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for Religion, than from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of it.</p>
               <p>And whereas Mr <hi>Collier</hi> takes a great
deal of pains to prove that a Priest
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58549:68"/>
ought not to be contemn'd because he
is a degree above a Gentleman; that
defence methinks is not altogether so
pertinent. For it is evident, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of degrees superiour to Gentlemen
are every day expos'd on the Stage.
And besides, the way for a Clergyman
to secure himself from contempt, is not
to boast of secular advantages which in
him is truly ridiculous, but to shew his
Meekness and his Humility, which are
true Christian virtues.</p>
               <p>Besides, the Characters in every Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
are always at the bottom univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
and allegorical, or else the instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
could not be universal. A ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
or vicious Priest in a Comedy, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
any man who has such follies or
vices, and the Cassock is produc'd on
purpose to signify to the Clergy, that
they are partly concern'd in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and have sometimes their
vices and follies as well as the Laity.</p>
               <p>The exposing upon the Stage a Priest,
who is an ill, or a ridiculous person,
can never make the order contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for nothing can make the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
contemptible but Priests. He
among them who writ the <hi>Grounds of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58549:68"/>
the Coutempt of the Clergy,</hi> says nothing
that I remember of the Stage; but he
says a great deal of their own follies,
and something too of their vices; now
the exposing these follies and vices,
would be a way to reclaim them, and
so to preservè the esteem that they
have in the world.</p>
               <p>This is plain from experience: For
the Inferiour Clergy is much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
in <hi>England,</hi> than the Regular
Clergy is either in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi>
where they are never expos'd on the
Stage. And their lives are here less
scandalous than they are abroad. They
who have been at <hi>Marseilles,</hi> may inform
Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> that it is there a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
thing to see Priests, both Secular
and Regular, who are slaves in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
for the most detestable crimes</p>
               <p>It appears to be full as necessary, to
expose a Priest, who is an ill man, as
one of the Laity, because his example
is more contageous, and the salvation
of so many Souls depend on it: whereas
a Layman influences fewer. Besides, a
Layman often offends thro want of
consideration, because he does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect,
his worldly avocations diverting
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58549:69"/>
his thoughts from Religion; so that
such a one may have returns of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
But an ill Clergyman cannot
pretend inconsiderateness, for it is his
daily business to reflect on his Duty;
and consequently such a one must be a
downright Atheist; and an Atheist sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
on this side the Law, has nothing
to restrain him but the apprehension of
infamy, and the fear of becoming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</p>
               <p>Besides, a Layman who transgresses,
has his Rector or his Curate to remind
him of his duty. Shall a Clergyman
who is an ill liver go on without admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.
Is that for his advantage, or
the benefit of his flock, or the good
of the publick.</p>
               <p>We own indeed that it is our duty
to be instructed by them, yet ought
they sometimes to take their turn,
and be subject to our remonstrances:
As the <hi>Roman</hi> Consuls, if we may have
leave to make such a comparison, were
accountable to the Tribunes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by the policy of that constitution.
Thus I have answer'd what may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
from Reason against the Stage in
general, and what Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58549:69"/>
against the <hi>English</hi> Stage in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
I mean as much as was fit to be
answer'd. For there is no defending
the Immodesty, or Immorality of, or
unnecessary Prophaneness of some of
our Plays. Let us now come to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
which Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has brought
from Authority.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Objections from Authority
Answer'd.</head>
               <p>THe objections from Authority are
of two sorts, Councils and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But now let me ask Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
this question, Were these persons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
or no? That is, did the Spirit of
God dictate whatever they writ to em?
If he says it did, I have nothing to say
to such a man, but abandon him to
Ecclesiastical censure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If he says it did
not, why then I must tell him, that we
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58549:70"/>
live in an age in which there are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that are too judicious, and too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
to forego their reasons for meer
Human Authority. An age in which
we account it not only an absurdity,
but a sin to believe in any thing under
Heaven; as well knowing that Reason
is the top of all human things; and tho
not so sacred as Revelation, is in some
measure Divine. For Reason is given
us by God for our guide, where we
have no Revelation to contradict it.
And both Human Authority and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
hold and depend on Reason.
We always assent to Revelations divine
Authority, because Reason assures us,
that we always ought to assent to it:
And we sometimes refuse to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
human Authority, because we
are convinc'd by Reason that we ought
not to submit to it.</p>
               <p>For the Councils he has cited, I must
tell him, that we are not oblig'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
any of those Councils Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible;
but refuse to be determin'd by
their decrees, unless they are confirm'd
by Reason or Revelation.</p>
               <p>Now I desire to know of Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
whether he himself pays the last defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58549:70"/>
to those Councils or no? If he
answers, that he owns their Authority,
how durst he appear to have read so
many Plays as he has cited thro out this
Book, when the Decrees of these Councils
even in this very case appear from his
own citations so much stronger against
the Clergy than they do against the
Laity? But if he answers, that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owns
their Authority, with what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
assurance can he offer to impose
it on us that while he takes his own sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
he may laugh àt our credulity?</p>
               <p>But to come to the Fathers, they had
their reasons for crying out against the
Stage, which cannot so much as be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to us. They had
chiefly five, and those five reasons will
serve to answer whatever has been ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Mr <hi>Collier</hi> in his long Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
scrowl.</p>
               <p>First, Plays in their time were a part
of the Pagan worship; and that in the
beginning of Christianity was alone a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
motive to oblige the Fathers to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
those diversions to the new Christians,
several of which may be very well sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to be not yet confirm'd in the
Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:58549:71"/>
The Second reason why the Fathers
forbad the first Christians Plays, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Combats of the Gladiators
were mingled with those diversions, and
something which was full as barbarous.

               </p>
               <p>The Third was the gesticulations of
the Pantomimes, which indeed were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferably
lewd, and unfit to be seen
not only by Christians, but by any civil
people.</p>
               <p>Let any one but consult what Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
has cited from the Fathers, and he
will find that these were three of the
main reasons which prevail'd upon the
Fathers to forbid the Christians the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
of the Theatre.</p>
               <p>'Tis not lawful (<hi>says</hi> Theophilus, <hi>whom
he cites first</hi>) for us to be present at the
Prizes of your Gladiators, lest by this
means we should be accessary to the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
there committed. Neither dare we
presume upon the Liberties of your other
shews, lest our sences should be touched and
disobliged with indecency and prophaneness.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Tertullian,</hi> whom he cites next,
says in his Apologetick, <hi>We keep off from
your publick shews, becáuse we can't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58549:71"/>
the warrant of their original.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there are two reasons behind;
the first of which was drawn from the
purity of the primitive times. Which
makes <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has cited
him, cry out, page 354. <hi>But if you
can't wait for delight, if you must be put
into present possession,</hi> &amp;c. By which
<hi>Tertullian</hi> seems to allow, that diversions
indeed are necessary, but that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
will find abundant entertainment
in the very exercise of their Religion.
This, I must confess, was very well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by <hi>Tertullian.</hi> But if <hi>Cato</hi> was
formerly laugh'd at, for speaking in the
Senate as if he had liv'd in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
whereas he was really in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dregs of that of <hi>Romulus,</hi> how shall this
upstart Reformer escape contempt, who
has apply'd to this profligate Age, what
<hi>Tertullian</hi> directed to those fervent
Christians, whose Souls were flaming
with divine love in the purity of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
times.</p>
               <p>Thus have I examin'd four of the five
reasons, not one of which can be a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to us. For, neither is our Drama a
part of Idolatrous worship, nor have we
either Gladiators or Pantomimes; nor
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58549:72"/>
the people of this age be satisfy'd to be
always entertain'd with the Scripture,
but require other diversions.</p>
               <p>But the fifth reason is yet to come;
by which it will appear, that these vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Gentlemen are by no means quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to judge of a cause, of which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
even from Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s citations,
that they have not the least knowledge.</p>
               <p>For, says the Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> whom
he cites first. <hi>The Tragical distractions
of</hi> Tereus <hi>and</hi> Thyestes <hi>are nonsense to
us.</hi> Now could any man possibly talk
thus, who had the least knowledge of
the nature of Tragedy, and particularly
of that Tragedy? It was below that
Prelate to consider <hi>Horace,</hi> for he
would have told him,
<q>
                     <l>Irae Thyesten exitio gravi</l>

                  </q>
Is the Moral which the Poet draws
from this Fable nonsense to us? Is it
impertinence in a Poet to tell us, that
we ought to restrain our anger, because
the indulging it has often brought
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58549:72"/>
men into fatal calamities? For had this
Prelate understood this affair, what
could he have possibly dislik'd here?
The Moral or the Fable? The Moral?
That methinks should be hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
of a professor of that Religion,
which is therefore extoll'd above all
others, because it is more Moral. Was
it the Fable then which offended him,
or the manner of conveying the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction?
Methinks it is something odd
in a Christian Prelate to condemn that
method of Teaching which was chiefly
practis'd by his great Master, whom he
professes to imitate.</p>
               <p>But now to come to the Author <hi>De
Spectacul is:</hi> What need I mention, <hi>says
he,</hi> the Levities and Impertinence in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
or the Ranting Distractions of

and unbecoming the gravity of

               <p>Now let me ask Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> whether
it be lawful for Christians to read Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
It would certainly be the absurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thing in the world to deny it. Now
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58549:73"/>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> has declar'd very formally that
Tragedy is more grave and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
than History. And tho when
the question is concerning Grace, I will
believe the least of the Fathers before
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> and all his Interpreters the
Schoolmen together; yet where the
dispute is concerning the nature of
Writing, and the colours of Speech, I
will believe <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s single testimony,
before all the Fathers and Councils
joyn'd in a body.</p>
               <p>Tho Plays are forbidden by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Councils, yet the Fathers
own, and Mr <hi>Collier</hi> owns, that they
are not forbidden by Scripture: Nor
are they forbidden by Reason. For
who are they who frequent them?
Who are they that approve of them?
Who are they that have not the least
scruple about them? Not a parcel of
fools that are carry'd away by meer
imagination, and are only fit for <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam;</hi>
but the best and most reasonable
part of the Nation, and particularly a
thousand whom I could name that are
considerable for their extraordinary
qualities. Now I cannot for my life
apprehend upon what account any
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58549:73"/>
thing that is not forbidden by God;
that is neither prohibited by Reason
nor Revelation, should be forbidden by
men. We know what our Saviour has
said in St <hi>Matthew</hi> of those who teach
for Doctrines the Commandments of
men, <hi>c. 15. v.</hi> 9. That it renders all their
zeal ineffectual. But then, says <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
as he is cited by Mr <hi>Collier, p.</hi> 245.
<hi>The Play-house is implicitly, tho not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
forbid by the Scripture, in the first
verse of the first Psalm: Blessed is the
man who walketh not in the counsel of the
ingodly, nor stands in the way of sinners,
nor sits in the seat of the scorner.</hi> But
then say we, that nothing can be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
by this, but what the Scripture or
Reason have declar'd to be the counsel
of the ungodly, and the way of sinners.
Now, as we have manifestly shown
above, neither Reason nor Revelation
says that of the Theatre. And as for
the seat of the scorner, that part of
the Text can only be applicable to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
and is full as applicable to the
Press, and sometimes to the Pulpit
itself.</p>
               <p>In the next place, says the Author
<hi>De Spectaculis,</hi> as he is cited by Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58549:74"/>
p.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>62. Some have thought the
Play-house no unlawful diversion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was not condemn'd by express
Scripture. <hi>Let meer modesty,</hi> says he,
<hi>supply the Holy Text, and let Nature
govern, where Revelation does not
reach. Some things are too black to lye
upon Paper, and are more strongly
forbidden because unmentioned. The
divine wisdom must have had a low
opinion of Christians, if it had descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to particulars in this case. Silence is
sometimes the best method of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
To forbid often puts people in mind
of what they should not do.</hi> Thus, say
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> says Mr <hi>Collier.</hi> But for my
part, I both hope and believe that he
wrongs him. For it is incredible to
me, that a Father of the Church should
reason, in so absurd a manner. For the
chief reason why <hi>Tertullian</hi> affirms that
the frequenting of Plays is not forbid
by Scripture, is because the crime is too
black to be particularly insisted on. As
if St <hi>Paul</hi> in the first Chapter of the
<hi>Romans</hi> had not descended to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
crimes of a blacker nature than this.
Can we suppose that Scripture, which
is a revelation of the will of God, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58549:74"/>
a supplement to the law of Nature,
should descend to condemn things
which Reason had before condemn'd as
abominable, and utterly against Nature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and shall it take no notice of things
which are allow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by Reason, and the
Law of Nature (as we have shewn that
the Theatre is) and which consequently
cannot be discover'd to be sins but by
the light of Revelations? Could St <hi>Paul</hi>
in the 5th Chap. to the I Ep. to the <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
rinthians</hi> be so particular as to descend
to a crime, which, when the Apostle
writ the Epistle, concern'd but only
one, who had married his Father's Wife,
and which could never be suppos'd to
concern very many, because the crime
was against the custom and consent of
Nations: Could the Apostle of the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> I say descend to this, and think
it too particular to mention a sin which
concern'd the salvation of so many
thousands who were then alive, and of
so many millions who were to succeed
them? Nay, could St <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 7th
of the 1st Ep. to the <hi>Cor.</hi> descend so
particularly, as to give his advice
against Marriage, which was neither
forbid by Revelation nor Reason, but
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58549:75"/>
was highly warranted by both, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary for the propagation
of Christianity, and the accomplishment
of the promises? Could the Apostle, I
say, descend to this, and take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of a sin of so black and damnable a
nature as frequenting the Theatres is
by Mr <hi>Collier</hi> pretended to be? A sin
too which endanger'd the salvation not
only of the Christians to whom he
writ, but those who were to succeed
them in all posterity? But, says <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
the Apostle had no occasion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
to condemn what is condemn'd
by Reason. But that which was a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time does not subsist
in ours, as we have plainly shewn above.
But if any one at last shall urge, that
the acting of Plays was condemn'd by
express Scripture, because it was a part
of the Pagan worship, and Idolatry was
expressly condemn'd; to this I answer,
That nothing can make more for my
cause than this: For since the Spirit of
God condemn'd the representation of
Plays only as they were included under
Idolatry, you must either shew that the
Spirit of God did not foresee that in
process of time they would cease to be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58549:75"/>
Idolatrous, which to affirm is horrible
Blasphemy; or you must acknowledge,
that by condemning them only under
the general term of Idolatry, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
them, and allow'd of them, as
soon as they should be no longer Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous;
or else you must be forc'd to
acknowledge that the word of God is
defective, and does not contain all
things which are necessary to the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his people. Besides, it may
be manifestly prov'd from St <hi>Paul,</hi> that
the Idolatry of them extended no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to the representation of them,
which representation was render'd Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous,
only by the direction and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the Magistrates and Publick,
at whose expence they were represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for St <hi>Paul</hi> has sufficiently warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the writing them, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the reading of them, by citing
a verse of a Comick Poet in the first
Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ch. 15. v. 33.
for if those writings had been in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Idolatrous, St <hi>Paul</hi> durst neither
have read them while a Jew, nor cited
them while a Christian, Idolatry both
to Jew and Christian being alike abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.
But it is evident that he has
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58549:76"/>
cited them; for it is known to all the
world, that <hi>evil communication cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts
good manners,</hi> is a verse of <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> particularly
could not be ignorant of it. Since then
the Spirit of God thought fit to put the
verse of a Comick Poet into the mouth
of his greatest Apostle, as very fit for
the instruction of his people, and the
reformation of mankind; and since the
same Spirit has said not a Syllable to
condemn either Plays or Theatres, any
farther than as they are included under
Idolatry, it seems to be very plain to
me, that he has not only approved, but
recommended Plays to his people, when
they are not corrupt and idolatrous.
For the <hi>Corinthians</hi> saw plainly that
St <hi>Paul</hi> had read <hi>Menander,</hi> they were
convinc'd that he had cited him for their
instruction, and consequently that he
approv'd of him: since then they were
satisfied that the Apostle read him, why
might not they do the like, when St
<hi>Paul</hi> had not said so much as a word to
discourage 'em. Now if the reading him
could be allowable, why should not
the seeing him be equally lawful, when
the representation should cease to be
corrupt and idolatrous?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:58549:76"/>
And therefore St <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the
rest of the School-men, who liv'd when
Dramatical representations were no
longer Idolatrous, have loudly declared
them lawful; and they are at this very
day encouraged in Countries, where
they are mortally severe against any
thing that offends Religion, and where
the cruelty of the Inquisition is most
outrageous. Thus have I endeavour'd
to shew, that Plays are instrumental to
human happiness, to the welfare of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the advancement of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety;
that Arts and Empire have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
with the Stage, which has been
always encouraged by the best of Men,
and by the bravest Nations. After
which I hope the Enemies of Plays will
be reconciled to our Theatres, and not
by persisting in their aversion, affect
to seem more wise than the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
more austere than the <hi>Romans,</hi> more
nice than the School-men, more cruel
than Inquisitors, and more zealous
than the Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
