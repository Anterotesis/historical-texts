            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The firſt Claſſis did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly frame a new one, ſomewhat according to the <hi>Geneva</hi> form. But this the ſecond Claſſis diſliked, and altered in 600 particulars; that again had the fate to be quarrell'd by the third Claſſis, and what the third reſolved on, by the fourth; and the diſſenting of thoſe Brethren, as the Diviſion of tongues at <hi>Babel,</hi> was a fair means to keep that Tower then from advancing any higher. Nay even for our neighbours of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> themſelves, what ever ſome of them of late have thought fit to do, ſince they became Covenanteers, (in animoſity perhaps and oppoſition to that terrible <hi>mormo,</hi> the Liturgy ſent to them from hence) we know that they were Presbyterians formerly, without ſeeing any neceſſity of aboliſhing Liturgy.</p>

I ſhall adde no more to this reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, but that the totall violent illegall abolition of Liturgy in a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Church, is certainly of this nature, and being ſuperadded to the change of the Government into a Form quite contrary to that which for 1600 yeers hath prevailed in the univerſall Church of Chriſt, there ſetled by the Apoſtles, may be allow'd the ſtile of <hi>inſignis mutatio,</hi> a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſome conſiderable importance to a Chriſtian ſtate, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted altogether without any preparative alleviating ſteps, will (by the rapid ſudden motion at leaſt, if there were nothing elſe) have a dangerous influence upon the whole body, of which the cunningeſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner cannot at this diſtance foreſee the effects, or prevent the emergent miſchiefs which ſucceeding time may diſcover.

Church as <hi>contrary to edification.</hi> Farther yet, 'tis clear by text, that the Apoſtles when they met together, to holy duties (ſuch are Faſting, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, receiving the Sacrament) continued very long time, ſometimes a whole day together. This being too much to be alwayes continued in the Church, and unſuteable to every mans buſineſſe, is ſaid to have been the occaſion that S. <hi>James</hi> firſt made choice of ſome ſpeciall Prayers moſt frequently by them uſed, which was after called his <hi>Liturgie,</hi> which (or ſome other in the diſguiſe of that) the Greek Church ſtill uſe on ſolemn dayes. This alſo being of the longeſt for every dayes uſe, St <hi>Baſil</hi> is ſaid to have ſhortned, and that again St <hi>Chriſoſtome;</hi> how certain theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports are, I ſhall not take upon me to affirm, but onely adde, that the Greek Church, who are moſt likely to know the truth of it by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, do retain all theſe three <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and would loudly laugh at any man that ſhould make doubt whether St <hi>James,</hi> St <hi>Baſil,</hi> and St <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> were not the Authours of them. 2. That the judgement of that Church (if they are deceived alſo, and may not be thought worthy to be heeded by our Aſſemblers) is yet an argument of great authoritie to any prudent man, if not that theſe <hi>Liturgies</hi> were purely the ſame with thoſe which were written by that Apoſtle, and thoſe holy men, yet that there were ſuch things as <hi>Liturgies</hi> of their penning. The like might be added of that ſhort form of St <hi>Peters,</hi> which alone they ſay was uſed in the Roman Church for a great while, till after by ſome Popes it was aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and the ſame of St <hi>Marks</hi> Liturgy. I am ſure St <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking of ſome forms retained in the Church, and ſtill to be found in our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> particularly that of <hi>Surſum corda,</hi> Lift up your hearts, &amp;c. faith, that they are <hi>verba ab ipſis Apoſtolorum temporibus petita,</hi> words fetcht from the times of the Apoſtles, which ſuppoſes that they did uſe ſuch Forms.

To theſe brief inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations I ſhall need adde no more, when the concluſion that I am to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre is ſo moderate, being onely this, that it is not <hi>neceſſary</hi> to turn all bowing, or kneeling, or bodily worſhip out of the Church, (were there any ſuperſtition in any one or more geſtures, this were too great a ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to mulct the Church of all, above the proportion of the moſt unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited arbitrary Court, whoſe amercements muſt alwayes be within the compaſſe of <hi>ſalvo contenemente,</hi> which this will not be, if there be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of bodily <hi>worſhip</hi> left behind) and that the <hi>Liturgie</hi> doth better to preſcribe it at fit times, then the <hi>Directory</hi> to omit all mention of it at all times, unleſſe by way of diſlike and prohibition. Which concluſion will be the more eaſily evinced againſt them, by asking them whether in their Family-Parlour-Prayers; or in their private Cloſet-prayers, they do not approve and practice that geſture; which as I believe in charity they do, ſo I muſt from thence infer, that by them <hi>the houſe of God,</hi> is the onely place thought fit to be <hi>deſpiſed.</hi> And if it be replyed, that the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory</hi> forbids not kneeling, but onely commands it not, leaving it free to uſe or not to uſe. I anſwer. 1. That the effect of this liberty is very remarkable among them, and equall to that of a prohibition, no man almoſt of their perſwaſion ever kneeling in their Churches. 2. That the never ſo much as <hi>recommending</hi> it, is very near a <hi>forbidding</hi> of it. 3. That <hi>bowing</hi> or <hi>adoration</hi> is directly forbidden once (which by the way, is as much the defining of a Ceremony, <hi>viz.</hi> that of ſtanding or going up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and ſo as contrary to the Independants perſwaſions, and to the great clamorous complaint for <hi>Liberty</hi> in Ceremonies, as any preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>of kneeling or bowing</hi> can be.) 4. That kneeling alſo is at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacrament forbidden, by neceſſity of conſequence, ſitting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſcribed, and therefore that that reply or excuſe is falſe alſo. And ſo now what <hi>ſpeciall advantage</hi> this is like to bring in to this Church of ours, to have the bodies of negligent, or prophane, or Factious men left (without any ſo much as an admonition) to their own inclinations and ſo what depth of Eccleſiaſticall policy there was which made this change ſo <hi>neceſſary,</hi> I deſire now may be judged.</p>

What <hi>Ordinances</hi> they were of which ſuch men were deprived, I conceive is ſpecified by the next words, that <hi>ſundry good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have been by means thereof kept from the Lords table,</hi> which muſt needs refer to thoſe that would not <hi>kneel</hi> there, and why that ſhould be ſo unreaſonable, when the very <hi>Directory</hi> layes the matter ſo, that none ſhall receive with them who do not <hi>fit,</hi> there will be little ground, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be that no poſture in the <hi>Service</hi> of God can be <hi>offenſive,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of <hi>kneeling,</hi> which indeed hath had the very ill luck by <hi>Socinus,</hi> in his Tract <hi>De Coenâ Domini,</hi> to be turn'd out of the Church as Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latricall (with whom to affirm the ſame will be as great a <hi>complyance,</hi> as <hi>kneeling</hi> can be with the <hi>Papiſts.)</hi> And by theſe as <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> at leaſt, I know not for what guilt, except that of too much <hi>humility,</hi> as being in M. <hi>Archer</hi> his Divinitie, as before I intimated, a betraying of one of the <hi>greateſt comforts</hi> in the Sacrament, the <hi>ſitting fellow Kings with Chriſt in his earthly Kingdom,</hi> confeſſing thereby that ſome mens hearts are ſo ſet on that <hi>earthly Kingdom,</hi> that the hope of an <hi>Heavenly Kingdom,</hi> will not yeeld them comfort, unleſſe they may have that other in the way to it; and withall telling us, that he and his Compeers are thoſe men.</p>

For part of the propoſition was, that the <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie was offence to the Reformed Churches abroad,</hi> To which the <hi>[For]</hi> is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56538:31"/>
immediately annext, as if it introduced ſome <hi>proofe</hi> of that alſo. But 'tis apparent, that the proofes ſpecified inferre not that, for neither <hi>the burthen of reading is offence</hi> to them, nor are <hi>their Conſciences diſquieted,</hi> nor <hi>they deprived of Gods ordinances by that means.</hi> In which reſpect 'tis neceſſary for us to conclude, that the word <hi>Offence,</hi> as applyed to them nor are <hi>their conſciences diſquieted,</hi> nor <hi>they deprived of Gods ordinance by that meanes.</hi> In which reſpect 'tis neceſſary for us to conclude, that the word <hi>Offence,</hi> as applyed to them, is taken in that other notion, that they are <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> and <hi>angry</hi> at it. To which we then muſt anſwer, that although there is no guilt inferred from the undergoing this fate of being <hi>diſliked</hi> by ſome, but rather that it is to be deemed an ill indication to be <hi>ſpoken well of by all,</hi> yet have we never heard of any Forrreigne Church which hath expreſt any ſuch <hi>offence;</hi> the utmoſt that can be ſaid, is (and yet not ſo much as that is here ſuggeſted) that ſome particular men have expreſt ſuch diſlike; to whom we could eaſily oppoſe the judgement of others more eminent among them who have largely expreſt their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of it. And 'tis obſervable, that <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelfe, when from <hi>Frank fort</hi> he had received an <hi>odious</hi> malitious account of many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in our <hi>Liturgy</hi> (as any will acknowledge that ſhall compare the report then made, with what he finds) though he were ſo far tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to call them <hi>ineptias</hi> follies, yet addes the Epithet of <hi>tolerabiles,</hi> that though ſuch, they were yet tolerable. And therefore</p>
            <p>In the third place, I may now conclude, that if all that is thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to prove the <hi>Offence</hi> in the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> uſed in the Church of <hi>England</hi> were (after all this evidence of the contrary) ſuppoſed true, yet is it no argument to infer the juſtice of the preſent deſigne which is not <hi>reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but <hi>aboliſhing</hi> both of that and all other <hi>Liturgie.</hi> Were the <hi>Offence</hi> in <hi>the length of the Service,</hi> that <hi>length</hi> might be reform'd, and yet <hi>Liturgie</hi> remain; were there <hi>Offence</hi> in the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or <hi>miſchief in the puniſhing</hi> them that have not <hi>conformed,</hi> thoſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> might be left free, that <hi>Conformity</hi> be not thus preſt, and ſtill <hi>Liturgie</hi> be preſerved inviolate. As for the forreign Churches, 1. I ſhall demand, whether onely <hi>ſome</hi> are thus offended, or <hi>all.</hi> Not all, for ſome of the wiſeſt in theſe Churches have commended it; and if <hi>ſome onely,</hi> then it ſeems others are not <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,</hi> and why muſt we be ſo partiall, as to <hi>offend</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſe</hi> ſome, that we may eſcape the <hi>offending</hi> others? not ſure becauſe we more eſteme the judgements of the latter, for by the Apoſtles rule the <hi>weaker</hi> men are, the more care muſt be taken, that they be not <hi>offended.</hi> 2 I ſhall ſuppoſe that their <hi>Liturgie,</hi> or their having none at all, may poſſibly <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> us, and then demand why they ſhall not be as much obliged to

I am aſhamed to preſſe this illogicall diſcourſe too far, which ſure never foreſaw ſuch exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, being meant onely to give the People a formall ſpecious ſhew for what is done, a heap of <hi>popular Arguments,</hi> which have of late gotten away all the cuſtome from <hi>Demonſtrations,</hi> and then, <hi>Si populus vult deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi, decipiatur</hi> if the <hi>tame Creature will thus be taken, any fallacy,</hi> or <hi>Topicke</hi> doth as well for the turn, as if <hi>Euclid</hi> had <hi>demonſtrated</hi> it.</p>

Whether that which drives away all Papiſts from all kind communion or converſation with us, from all hearing of our Preaching or Doctrine, be more likely to work them over to our ſide, then that which permits them to come to our <hi>Churches</hi> with us. For this is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly known, that as our Liturgy now is, and was framed in <hi>Queen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeths</hi> dayes, the Papiſts did for ten years together, at the beginning of her Reign, come to <hi>Church</hi> with us, and ſo continved, till the <hi>Popes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating the Queen</hi> and <hi>our Nation,</hi> made it ſo appear unlawfull for them.

under it, contrary to the pretended ſad experience, &amp;c. and withall we have made it clear, that all the exceptions here propoſed againſt the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi> are perfectly vain and cauſleſſe; as <hi>that it hath prov'd an offence,</hi> &amp;c. the ordinary crime charg'd on thoſe actions that are liable to no other, and ſo that <hi>offence without a cauſe; that this offence hath been by the length of the Service,</hi> which will onely offend the prophane, and withall, is as obſervable in your Service; <hi>by the many unprofitable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome Ceremonies,</hi> which have been ſhewed neither to be many, nor unprofitable, nor burthenſome; <hi>by the diſquieting of Conſciences,</hi> i. e. one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the unquiet; <hi>by depriving them of the Ordinance,</hi> i. e. thoſe who would rather looſe the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> then receive it kneeling, or reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>that the offence was extended to the reformed Churches abroad alſo,</hi> and yet for that no one proof offered, nor Church named that was ſo offended: and if there were, yet ſtill this ſupposed offenſiveneſſe, no juſt plea for any thing but Reformation. So alſo <hi>that by means of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, many were debarred of the exerciſe of their Miniſtery,</hi> the ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for the moſt part a meer calumny, and that which was true in it, ready to be retorted upon theſe Reformers: <hi>that the Prelates have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd to raiſe the eſtimation of the Liturgy too high,</hi> yet that no higher then you would the value of your <hi>Directory,</hi> to have it the rule for the manner of publick worſhip, or if they did, this is the fault of thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, not of the Liturgy; who yet were ſaid but to have labour'd it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not to have effected it; and even that labour or deſire of theirs, to have amounted no higher then <hi>Calvin's</hi> letter to the Protectour would avow; <hi>that this hath been to the justling out of Preaching,</hi> which is rather a ſpeciall help to it, and preſcribes it, and allows it its proper place, but hath oft the ill luck to be turn'd out by Preaching; <hi>that it hath been made no better then an Idol,</hi> which if it be a fault in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, is as farre more chargeable on the hearing of Sermons <hi>that the people pleaſe themſelves in their preſence, and lip-labour in that ſervice;</hi> an uncharitable judging of mens hearts, and a crime to which your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory makes men as lyable as the Liturgy; <hi>that our Liturgy is a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Papiſts, and ſo a means to confirm them in their Idolatry, &amp;c.</hi> whereas it complies with them in nothing that is Idolatrous, &amp;c. and by complying with them, where they do with antiquity and truth, it is more apt to convince them of their errors, and by charity to invite, then by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance; that it makes an idle Miniſtery;</hi> which ſure the Directory will not unmake, being as fit for that turn, either by forming and conning the Prayer there delineated, or by depending on preſent conceptions, as the Liturgie can be; <hi>that it hinders the gift of Prayer,</hi> which if it ſignifie

the elocution, or conception of words in Prayer, is not peculiar to the Miniſter, and for any thing elſe, hindring it no more then the <hi>Directory</hi> doth; <hi>that the continuance of it would be matter of endleſſe ſtrifes &amp;c.</hi> which ſure 'tis more reaſonable to think of an introduction of a new way of Service, then the retaining of the <hi>old; that there be many other weighty conſiderations, and many particulars in the book, on which this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is grounded,</hi> and yet not one of theſe mention'd, but kept to <hi>boil</hi> in their own breaſts, if there be any, or which is more likely, falſely here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to inflame the reckoning; <hi>that they are not mov'd to this by any love of novelty,</hi> and yet do that which is moſt <hi>novell; that they intend not to diſparage the Reformers,</hi> and yet do that which is moſt to their <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement; that they do this to anſwer Gods providence,</hi> which never call'd them to this work, <hi>to ſatisfie their own Conſcience,</hi> which if Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, muſt not thus be ſatisfied; <hi>to ſatisfie the expectation of other Churches</hi> which expect it not, or if they did, might rather conform to us and ſatisfie us; <hi>and the deſires of many of the godly at home,</hi> whoſe pietie is no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that their deſires are reaſonable, and yet are not known to have expreſt any ſuch deſires; <hi>that they may give teſtimony of their endeavours for uniformity,</hi> whereas with other Churches, there is no ſuch neceſſity of conforming in ſuch matters, and within our ſelves, nothing is ſo contrary to uniformity, as this endeavour. And laſtly, we have learnt from them, a rule by which they pretend to form their <hi>Directory,</hi> the agreeableneſſe to <hi>the Word of God, and Chriſtian prudence,</hi> and are moſt confident to juſtifie our <hi>Liturgy</hi> by that rule, againſt all Diſputers in the World; And having now over and above all this, a plain confeſſion under their own hands, in their Supply of Prayer, to juſtifie all that we pretend to, and ſo being ſaved the pains of any farther ſuperfluous confutation, we ſhall leave it to the judgement of any rationall Lay-man in the <hi>New Aſſembly,</hi> to judge betwixt us and his fellow Members; whoſe pretenſions are moſt moderate in this matter, whoſe moſt like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, thoſe that are to reſcue and preſerve, or thoſe which to deſtroy.
