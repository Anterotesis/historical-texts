            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:94669:13"/>
so excellent a mirrour as <hi>Curvus Acilius,</hi> a man of extreme age, but a vigourous minde, an inviolate conscience. Him you had for an example; but (although your steps were <hi>Curva vestigia</hi>) refusing to follow <hi>Curvus,</hi> you have turned the right into oblique, you know you well knew (to the aggravation of your censure, those golden sentences of Periander, most worthy your memory, that <hi>nothing must be done for moneys sake,</hi> and that <hi>favour is an enemy to Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For Iudgement faileth where it becomes matter of affection. Too much love and too much hatred pervert the truth.

                  <p>Stand forth, stand forth, Sir Iudges of a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition. You have not denyed but that you are guilty of the crime for which you are indited; Nor can you produce any defence of your desperate cause, which is worthy our hearing: you know, you wel know that a Iudg is to be iudged in none of those things, which he is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to iudge in another. In which, I say, how wretchedly have you erred? For you were Iudges, &amp; censurers of the selfe same crime, whereof you were the Authors. For a Iudge to take a bribe, was a capitall thing; But if so great &amp; so heavy a sentence was pronouced for one fault, &amp; that extending but to a particular subiect, what punishment must be inflicted on them, who have beene so iniurous to the subiects, of a whole flourishing Iland; by making the Prince suspicious of his subiects: the Subiects of their Prince; by declaring new opinions against the evident te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonys of their consciences; by perturbing the Halcyon days of a peacefull king, &amp; an obedient state; yea by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all according to their power, into flames and ashes; If such a fire whereof you were the true Incendiarys, do not deserve death, what it better deserveth I cannot tell. The law was first ordained to be a publike benefit; but by you it
<pb facs="tcp:94669:15"/>
is made the very plague of the common weale; You have all very well acted the part of <hi>Midas</hi>: Being Commissaryes of trust between Prince &amp; people, which you should not violate for threatnings, friends, entreaties nor rewards; you being intised by the bayle of avarice, or strucken with a Panick feare, have left Iustice naked; &amp; wretchedly negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted your consciences, which testified against you. And so through lucre or terrour, being blinded in your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, you have provided your selves true ministers of <hi>Midas.</hi>

                  <p>Observe &amp; heare what I shall say: I beleeve that in leasure houres, you have read how the Germanes having been rather conquered then subiect by their good leading of <hi>Drusus,</hi> assoone as hee was dead, trusting upon their strength began to hate the lust &amp; insolence of <hi>varus Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilius,</hi> and how easily they became victors. Which short conflict being ended, like <hi>Barbarians</hi> as they were, they shewed themselves most savage, &amp; tirranous conquerours: Nor in that extreame cruelty, did they shew themselves more implacable towards any condition, then to men of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sulare dignity, thinking that through their eloquent &amp; vendible tongues, the <hi>Romanes</hi> had first beleagued them, &amp; brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that calamity. <hi>Varus</hi> prosecuts them with the same mind &amp; fate of <hi>Paulus</hi> at <hi>Cannae,</hi> never was greater slaughter in fields &amp; woods, never more intolerable insulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:94669:16"/>
but especially towards those that pleaded causes. Some of their eyes pulled out, others hands cut off, one's mouth they sewed up, first cutting out his tongue, which a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian holding in his hand said, at length; <hi>viper desist from hissing,</hi> you should likewise call to mind <hi>Manius Acilius</hi>; that unsatisfied gulfe of briberie, &amp; principall Embassadour of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom <hi>Mithridates</hi> with great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ride upon an asse, untill he came unto <hi>Pergamus,</hi> where he commanded <hi>Elixar</hi> of gold to be thrust into his mouth, intimating that the <hi>Romans</hi> were to much given to briberys, &amp; had tongues, too eloquent in evil speaking. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ander Severus</hi> the greatest enemy of flatterers, commanded that <hi>Turinus</hi> one of his courtiers; should bee tyed to a stake in the market place, and smother'd to death with smoke, having a cryer proclaiming by him. <hi>Let him perish with smoke, that sold smoke</hi>: For it is better (to use <hi>Antisthenes</hi> words) to fall amongst crowes, then <hi>Parasites</hi>; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst crowes to be devoured dead, then amongst <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites</hi> to be devoured living. Therfore it wil be an argument of wisdome, for us to deale with you, who hath brought such plagues upon the common-weale, &amp; disturbed our peace by your slanderous iudgements, as <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> did with two of his subiects, men of vile conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded one to fly from <hi>Macedon,</hi> &amp; the other to follow him, which being done, his country was purged of such noxious sicophants: both departed but neitheir of them returned.</p>

                  <p>But if it seeme good to your wisdome, that the Church should have such degrees of <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>lower,</hi> we will have the Governours to be lay Elders. To which dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, wee thinke non more fit, nor generally able to bee chosen, then our venerable brethren, the cobler, the bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket maker; and button maker, (whom although that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micaster maker in Greens rents contended with, yet he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily excelled in efficacy of doctrine and won the victory) being men of meane learning, but wonderfully inspired.

                  <p>Parle we have heard your complaints, men and brethren with that greater attention, then they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited. As for <hi>Bishops</hi> we have left them but a dead and naked name, but we thought it fitter to cut off their vices then their offices. Desist at length from your dotages; whatsoever may commodiously be done, &amp; may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to the peace of the Church; that you must espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially provide for. If not the beames or at least the motes must be removed from your darkened eyes. They have no charity in them, who love not the unanimity of the Church; goe, get you home, and follow your busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Let it bee our parts to take care for the common good of our Prince, people and Countrey.</p>
