            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting subiectes of the low Countries, as they haue often pondered with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, the natural affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fatherly good inclination, which your Maiesty hath (since the time that your grace by the power of almighty God recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the dominion and regiment of the sayd countreis) always and continually shewed: so haue they had a sure hope and vndoubted affiaunce, that your Maiesty as well vpon their daily complaynts and lamentations, as vpon the pitifull declarations and remo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances of some christian Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates vnto your Maiestie, mercifully haue considered of our pitifull and most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
<pb facs="tcp:20721:3"/>
suppressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherwith we by reason of the great and vnsupportable force, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, and wicked regiment of the Duke of Alba are suppressed, and mercifully haue regarded the most miserable ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of these your naturall low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, who alwayes haue béen most faithful and obedient, both to your Maiesty, and also your Graces predecessours. Not doubting but that your Maiestie would gréeuously haue béen moued, that hée vnder pretence of protecting and defending the Romish reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, vnder the colour of your Maiestyes name, should presume to frustrate &amp; breake all the priuileges, customes, and rightes, wherunto your Maiesty and your predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours haue sworne, persecuting your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full subiects in body and goods, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your countreys, in none other sorte, but as if he had declared himselfe to be an open enemy of your Maiesty and the subiects of the same.</p>
            <p>Therfore haue they always earnestly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that your Maiesty no longer suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the sayde force, woulde haue prouided some conuenient meanes for the safegarde of your countreys, and deliuerance of your poore and suppressed subiects, and haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the dutifull office of a kinge, whom the almightie God, the kinge of all kinges,
<pb facs="tcp:20721:3"/>
hath placed and ordeyned as a protectour of the righteous, and a fatherly pastor of the people vnder your subiection, to defend and preserue them from all force and violence: and likewise to remember the manifolde and faithfull seruices, which your sayd cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys and subiects, haue from time to time most faithfully done to your Maiestie and your predecessours.</p>
            <p>But they now (to their extreme gréefe) considering that all their former supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are as nothing regarded and in vaine, and that al other the remonstrances of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Princes and Potentates, haue sortid no such effect as might haue turned to their comfort and consolation, and they in their consciences assuring themselues, that your Maiesty hath no reasonable occasion vpon euill will or displeasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so to alienate and turne your selfe from your lamentable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects: can not but vndoubtedly suspect, that through malyce and false information of some, who hauing more regard to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate lust and appetite, than to the seruice of your Maiesty, haue daily laboured to bring your Maiesties countreys into your displea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure. Wherin they haue alwayes most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly and vnfainedly pretended and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled, not onely by letting and defending that our humble supplications and faithfull
<pb facs="tcp:20721:4"/>
warnings should come to your Maiesties eares, misconstruing the same to the worst, and peruersly accusing them to your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, therby to bring the cuntrey into discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and commotion, &amp; so vnder your name to suppresse and make desolate the same, &amp; so with the goods and blood of your subiectes to quench their gréedy &amp; vnsatiable apetite.</p>
            <p>This is that (O most soueraigne Kinge) which your saide subiects doo, and haue not without occasion estéemed to be the greatest calamitie that might happen vnto them, as considering that the way and meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by they might complayne and shewe their griefes to your Maiestie, as to their boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and naturall Protector (so by God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as a refuge in their extremitie) is by the vngodly dealing of their ennemies taken away from them: a thinge which all wayes hath béen permitted to vnreasonable creatures: namely to suffer them in their extremitie and néede to sue for remedy and redresse.</p>
            <p>And therfore, although they had resolued and taken in hand with patience to attende the time of redresse, thinking that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie would at last haue opened your eares and eyes to heare and see their miserable estate, from which your Maiestie by reason of their saide euill willers is nowe letted.
<pb facs="tcp:20721:4"/>
But now considering in the ende their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, the longer the more to encrease &amp; to become more vnsufferable, tending not onely to their damage and destruction, but also of your Maiesties heritage and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, which in times past haue florished in all prosperitie, and now come to ruine: they could not for the faithfull obedience and ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance sake wherin they are bounde to your Maiesty and their natiue countrey, but now once againe by writing, request your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty to consider and weigh the originall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the desolation of your countries, &amp; by whose means the same is come to passe, and consequently execute the office of a true King, in defending the righteous, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering your countries from this tiranny &amp; oppression.</p>
            <p>And first we humbly beséech your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie to call to mind and consider, that these your countries in times past hauing bene deuided amongst sundry Lords and rulers, are since by mariadges, agréements, &amp; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall treaties, in time, and orderly by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full succession and conueniences come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the house of <hi>Burgondie,</hi> and afterwards, by meanes of mariages contracted with the most famous house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly allied with the most mighty king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Spaine</hi>

further or larger rehersall, whilest that vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doubtedly your Maiestie doth sufficiently reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, how that the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> of most noble memorie, following the presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes of his predecessours, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that the sayd othe of solempnisation is the onely and right foundation, vppon which doth consist aswell the might, &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of a Prince, as the faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his subiects, did in his life time, and presence of your Maiestie, cause your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie to receaue the sayd countries vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayd othe, and sware your Maiestie to the ioyfull income in all the landes and most of the townes, as next successour and onely heire of his emperiall Maiestie: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the same Emperiall Maiestie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of these countries, and your Maiestie receauing the full dominion, and administration of the Land: did once again, in presence of the Deputid of the countries then assembled, rehearse and strongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the saide priuileges. So that in all times past the sayd countries haue enioyed and bene ruled by their former priuileges &amp; liberties.</p>
            <p>Out of which hath followed such faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and obedience of the subiects towards their Prince, and such vnitie and loue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest ech other, that the countries by

            <p>And because it néedes not to rehearse any thing out of the old histories, being notwith standing explenished with many preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, it hath appeared in all the warres of the Emperiall Maistie, what earnest care hée had to the defence and mayntenaunce of his countries in rest and quietnes.</p>
            <p>Likewise your Maiestie can well remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber that he taking his leaue of these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, did specially and earnestly reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the state therof vnto your Maiestie: Yea your Maiestie being at his arriuall burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with gréeuous warres and extréeme charges, hath by experience found that all your subiectes both great and small, euerie one to his state and abilitie, haue bene rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to venture both life and goods in seruice of your Maiestie. Wherin aswel the Lords and nobles, as commons, haue so acquited and behaued themselues, that your Maiesty hath vanquished &amp; ouercome your enemies, gotten great praise &amp; renowne of al kings, and potentates, and made a fynall end of al warres and discentions, wherewith many
<pb facs="tcp:20721:6"/>
yeares before your auncetors and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries were troubled.</p>
            <p>Now if it might please your Maiestie, (which your lamentable and faithfull sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects do most humbly require) to enquire of and consider the originall occasions of the alterations of such good &amp; quiet prosperitie, into such miserable commotions and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, wherwith the countries are now suppressed: your Maiestie shall find them to spring out of the malice and enuie which some (being about your Maiestie) do beare to the prosperitie and welfare wherewith God almightie hath blessed your countries and subiectes.</p>
            <p>Which enuie and cancred malice, being further incensed and stuffed with vnsatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble auarice and vnmeasurable prodigalitie, hath brought them to such crueltie and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, that they altogether forgetting all affection and seruice which they did owe vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the countrie wherin they haue gotten great honour &amp; benefites, haue (to the great preiudice of the seruice of your Maiestie and common wealth of these countries) procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all meanes and practises this most haynous fyre of commotion, to thintent to aspire to the dignitie surpassing the states of the land, yea of your Maiestie.</p>
            <p>And knowing well that to compasse that
<pb facs="tcp:20721:7"/>
deuise, it was a matter impossible, the customes and liberties of the countries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning in force, which do altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary their wicked pretence: considering besides, how diligent and faithful they of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said countries were euery one in his voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (according to their othe) to stand to the maintenance of the same: they attempted in peruerse maner too interprete too your Maiestie the doings and procéedings of the Lordes, gouernours, and states of the land, tending to the maintenance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said rights, and liberties, in such sort as if they tended to disobedience or rebellion towardes your Maiestie.</p>
            <p>Amongest which, specially some being spirituall persons, haue by all meanes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted and sought, vnder pretence and sha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dowe of religion to confederate with other foraine prelates, and so by secret attempts and practises, to bring the countrie in hatred of your Maiestie, to thintent that they with their confederates which are by oth allyed not with your Maiestie, but with straunge rulers and countries in <hi>Italie</hi> &amp; els where, specially with the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Roome,</hi> might here beare rule and gouernaunce, &amp;c. and as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie and commoditie serued, to enlarge and confirme the same.</p>
            <p>For when they first perceiued that in all
<pb facs="tcp:20721:7"/>
the countries here abouts, yea ouer all Christendome, their rude and manifest abu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses, and errours, by reason of the neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and auarice of the priestes were discried, &amp; specially when it began to gréeue the chiefe &amp; notablest perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which ought one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to meddle with instructing of the people, in the faith and feare of God, and to execute his seruice with all fidelitie, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of the Prophetes and Apostels, did in steade therof, not onely contrarie to God his commaundement, but also to the decrées of the former Popes, and to all ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the old counsels, yea against all sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and vsages of Princes and countries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> take vppon them to deale in worldly and Ciuill pollicies: yea also in matters toutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warfare and rule of countries, séeking to suppresse all degrées, and to reserue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall gouernement to themselues, taking in hand to bring all estates in disdaine and hatred of the Princes, aswell the subiects of your Maiestie, as of diuers other kinges, &amp; Potentates, accusing them slaunderously with sedition and rebellion: whereby they haue stirred and prouoked, in all countries, troubles, and discention, warres and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, setting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> subiects at discord with their rulers, and the rulers against the subiects, &amp; generally turned all things vpside down,
<pb facs="tcp:20721:8"/>
and brought in execrable confusion and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, not estéeming who was endamaged, so as they might atchiue the accomplishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their rule and dominion, and bring all thinges vnder their rule and aucthoritie.</p>
            <p>And to that intent, haue they sought, to plant in this countrie the inquisition, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and inuented in <hi>Spaine</hi> by certaine <hi>Jewes, and Renegados,</hi> by that meanes to breake all priuileges, rightes, and auncient customes, and to make frustrate all sworen contracts, vsages, and counselles, and so to get a full power and dominion ouer all your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties faithfull seruants, which stand to the oth which they haue made to your Maiestie, not acknowledging any foraine Lords, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall or temporall, which might séeke by false accusations to impute vnto your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, heresie and rebellion, to the intent therby to attayne to their purpose,</p>
            <p>For better accomplishing wherof haue they by force vrged and brought in the new Bishops, contrary to all landrights, and sworne priuileges, to the emparing of your Maiesties aucthoritie: chusing them not for vertue, prudence, or learning (being most of them, of the most rude and vnlearnest sort) but onely for that they take them as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and true assistents, in the executing of their tiranny and crueltie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20721:8"/>Their sayd vngodly enterprises and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of the same being the longer the more espied, haue the most notablest Lords, Gouernours, and Gentlemen, with the townes and countrie, giuen intelligence &amp; knowledge to your Maiestie by continuall supplications, remonstrances and other possible meanes, how much the aucthorite of your Maiestie should be empared, short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and deminished, by the said Inquisitors and Bishoppes, being most of them straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and outlanders, by othe bound vnto foraine Princes, and (as they pretend) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt of your iurisdiction, and by the same haue alleaged the euident impossibilite to bring in such inuocations, and newelties, but that it would tend to the vtter ruine &amp; destruction of the whole countrie: seing that it was most apparant that the bringing in therof was but a borowed cloake to shadow their doings, in abusing of your Maiestie, &amp; suppressing of such as would controle their wicked and most notorious procedings and abuses, which they themselues can scarce conceale. Of which the number in these cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries is so great and manifold, and dayly doth more encrease: that if your Maiestie would haue ben ruled by their persuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; counsell in executing of rigour and extremi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties, they would haue made your Maiestie
<pb facs="tcp:20721:9"/>
a kyng without subiects, and your subiects without rulers, as is most notorious by the innumerable number of those, which in these countries haue vnder pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion bene executed and murthered aswell w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fyre, &amp; water, as with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sword: besides an infinite multitude which are fled out of the countrie bearing with them all occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; notable sciences to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> instructing of others, &amp; vnspeakeable preiudice of your Maiestie and countries.</p>
            <p>Whereupon your Maiestie was in the end occasioned to a myld moderation of the placardes, by the same declaring that your meaning was not to bring in the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which likewise was by the Duchesse of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the Lords and Gouernours of the countrie in the behalf of your Maiestie, solemply promised to all the Townes and subiects, and accordingly published by open proclamations, by commaundement of the Maiestrates. But shortly after, al that was ouerturned by meanes of the aforesaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who in déed séeme to haue firmely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded your Maiestie, that suche was to the deminishing of your Maiesties reputation and dignitie, vniustly alleadging, that your subiects would withdraw themselues from the duetifull obedience of your Maiestie. So that it is euident that your Maiestie vpon
<pb facs="tcp:20721:9"/>
their informations, was moued to send the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> out of <hi>Spaine</hi> into these Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tries, to the intent with armes and force to compell your Maiesties subiectes, to that which they of themselues haue with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie and obedience at all times offred.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding that the aforesayd Lordes and Townes of these countries had good occasion to thinke that they should bée greatly wronged through force of forayne souldiours, and rule of a straunge Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, not being of their Countrie, nor of your Maiesties kinred or descent, but such a one as did beare towards them a most can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred hatred, had meanes sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to preuent his comming into the countrie: yet because hée came in the name of your Maiestie, and to make euident that they had not rebelled or declined from the obedience of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, trusting to their conscience and right, haue willingly and honorably receiued him with all such as it pleased your Maiestie to sende with him, opening to him the gates of the Townes, deliuered into his hands the fortresses and strong holdes, and entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned garrisons, onely for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée declared, that such was the will and pleasure of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie to be thereby assured of the fidelitie &amp; obedience of your subiectes, which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused to your Maiestie as rebels and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.
<pb facs="tcp:20721:10"/>
Therfore, reason would haue requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the aforesaid Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> should by all meanes and diligence haue informed your Maiestie of such your subiects true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and inclination: and before hée had procéeded to the execution of rigour, taken good and full information of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints, and chiefly touching the bringing in of these new Bishops and Inquisitors, contrarying God and all rightes, and that vpon good and true report thereof made to your Maiestie, redresse and remedie might haue ben had. But now cleane contrarie wyse, so soone as hée was receyued and was in possession of the force and rule of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out kéeping of any order of Iustice, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing regard to the landrightes and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges whereunto your Maiestie is sworne: not onely put to death and chased away the most part of the Lordes and Gouernours of these countreis, by your Maiestie elected &amp; placed, but also generally declared all the priuileges and liberties to be forfaited, and the Countrie to be vsed as a country newly conquested by force of armes, to the vse of him and his associates, and so consequently freely to deale with the lyues and goods of your subiectes, as their lustes and appetites shall require.</p>
            <p>And if possibly might be layd before your
<pb facs="tcp:20721:10"/>
Maiesties eyes the excessiue force and not beard of cruelties which here haue ben vsed since the beginning of his gouernement, by spoyling, robbing, chasing away, and desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: by apprehending, taking, banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and confiscating of goods, yea by burning, hanging, headding, hacking, racking, &amp; most horrible and not before heard of tormentes and murtherings of the Subiects of your Maiestie, aswell Noble as innoble, poore as riche, yong as olde, widowes and orphanes, men, women, and yong maidens, of what state, qualitie, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition soeuer they were: we doubt not but that your Maiestie would be amased to heare the rehearsall thereof: yea and would be gréeued at the same, that vnder your name such vnnaturall crueltie and tyranny should be vsed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as neither <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris, Nero, Pharao, Herode,</hi> or any other Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Tyrant could haue inuented the lyke, as now is vsed towards your faythfull sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, which with their liues and goods haue alwayes laboured to kéepe the Crowne on your Maiesties head, agaynst all your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>And that your Maiestie would also haue taken remorse of so many innocent infants chased awaye out of their natiue Countrie into straung lands: so many poore widowes and orphanes, and also vpon the lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table
<pb facs="tcp:20721:11"/>
crye of the whole Countrie which now are suppressed by this most horrible tyrant.</p>
            <p>For there is none which could defend or preserue his goods from their auarice, their wyues or daughters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their filthy lustes, or their lyues from their bloudthirstinisse. Nobilitie, Richesse, manhood, or good seruice done in tymes past, could nothing preuaile, if once hée was entred intoo hatred of them. And without taking regard to the Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>risdictions or ordinary courses of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, hath stopped the Iurisdictions of al Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, either in ciuill or criminall causes which in any wyse concerne the confiscati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons pronounced in his bloudy Counsell, in such sorte as neyther spirituall or temporal persones, widowes or orphanes, hospitalls, Spittels, Lazarus houses, or other whiche had good and deuable reuenues, amongst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> confiscated goods, could get any payment or satisfaction. But the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> hath gotten all into his hands without any mind to discharge any the premisses, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the diuers and earnest solicitations &amp; requestes to him made in that behalfe by the States of the Countries, delaying the poore agréeued subiectes with dilatorie and vnfounded apostillations, the one alwayes contrarying the other, and without sending ouer the matters to the prouinciall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
<pb facs="tcp:20721:11"/>
or ordinary Iustices, to the intent to make them dispaire of any satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be made by the court, where by proces they haue ben so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moned to their excissiue charge, and vpon summes of small value haue bene forced to greater charges then the principal hath amounted vnto, not suffering any law full transport to be made of any one debte for the other. To consider what number of honest woomen and yonge maydens they haue with force and violence rauished &amp; that the one after the other: yea misused some euen to the death. Howe often haue they compelled the husbande to remaine w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wife, and the father with the daughter, to force the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with their eyes to beholde their most vilanous filthinesse, and made them as instruments to the accomplishinge of their luxurious luste, vsing such vnnaturall and beastly fashions, that wée are in a manner abashed and astonied to declare the same to your Maiestie. Howe often hath it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the husband séeking to defend hys wyfe or daughter of their rauishement, that they haue all togither as furious curres, run out of the house togither crying <hi>Spania, Spania,</hi> murtheringe a number of the poore commons. How many women great with childe haue they ript vp the bellies off, and murthered the frute in their wombes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20721:12"/>Haue they not fleyed and pulled off y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> skinns of some men being aliue and headdid their drommes with the same skin? others haue they not tosted with small fyres, nypped the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with red burning tonges euen to the death, and consequently murthered a number and made them dye a hundreth deathes? Howe many women haue they chased from their husbands, and children from their parents: yea what is there vnder the heauens so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest or holy which they haue not defiled and troden vnder foote? Uerily amongest all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, yea amongest the cruelest, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> buryinge of the dead, hath alwayes bene permitted and reuerenced.</p>
            <p>But this Tirant in the despyte of God and nature, is so obstinate and peruerse, that hée hath caused to be taken out of the graue the carcasses of the dead, and conueyed vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gallowes, vnder pretence because some of them dying without shrifte, &amp; others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out houseling had forfaited his goods which hée tooke as confiscated. What is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men more holy and honest, then is the state of Matrimonie being the only and true foundation of all mutual loue &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, the originall of loue, the bond of peace, and the direct way of all dealings amongst men: whereof this Tyrant maketh so little accompte, that hée seuereth the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their
<pb facs="tcp:20721:12"/>
wyues, and the wyues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their husbands, being ioyned togither in the congregation before God and his Angels, cleane contrary to the commaundement and institution of almighty God and rightes, &amp; all vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that they were ioyned togither in the way of heresie: but to saye trueth, it is onely in spoyling manner, to match the beautifull and riche Matrones with his Souldiours &amp; ruffians, and finally by his crueltie burst in sunder the original bande tending to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayning of all mutuall loue: murthering and killing the women which in time of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie had reléeued their husbands, &amp; the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for succouring the necessitie of their parents, yea those which had onely with a letter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted any of them. And to the ende that nothing shuld by him be left vndefiled, hath hée troden in most despitefull manner vnder foote the most holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, whereby wée are incorporated in the body of Iesus Christ and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of God his Church, willing and commaunding that those children which were Christened open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lawfully according to the institution of Iesus Christ, in the name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoste, should once agayn be baptised, vnder pretence that they were Christened as heretiques, and repugnant contrarie to all godly and naturall rightes,
<pb facs="tcp:20721:13"/>
ordonances of the church, &amp; decrées of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells.</p>
            <p>Furthermore it néedeth not to rehearse to your Maiestie, the gréeuous exactions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by him, one after an other, and with out measure doth vrge of the poore commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as the hundrethes, twenties, yea the tenth penie, of all goods, mouables and immoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, of all goods bought and sold, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, yea &amp; vrging by execution contrarie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduise &amp; counsell of al estates in these cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, not of the cleare gaines of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, but the tenth, and twentie penie of the capitall some of all sales. Whereby not onely all trades and trafficques, are abandoned out of the land, but likewise the subiectes of the same, depriued from the getting of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, of them, their wiues, and children. And notwithstanding that the states, haue at sundry times done their endeuour large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to infourme the said Duke of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences which might follow vppon the said demaund: and requested that he would in their behalfe aduertise your Maiestie therof: would not hearken to them, but shaked them of without any comefort: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was by intercession of the counsel &amp; states of the land therunto most earnestly instanced, and so therby caused the decay of all marchandise, compelled the inhabitants
<pb facs="tcp:20721:13"/>
through misery to flée away into other coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tries. And yet it is apparant, that when any necessitie is towardes for payment of the souldiers, no money is to be had, in such sorte that the Spanish souldiours are at af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdele in their payment xxviij. monethes, and the Dutche moste of them constrayned to go a begging from doore to doore: of which some haue by famine and misery perished. Notwithstanding the great sommes which the states haue leuied and paid to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the said souldiours, &amp; yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse haue his garnisons consumed, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out the most part of the townes, &amp; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the same with the <hi>Seruitio,</hi> which they haue bene forced to minister to the said Spanish souldiours, and those which haue giuen most money, as well to him, as to <hi>Don Frederico,</hi> or any of theirs, haue bene the first that were discharged of the sayde bondage of <hi>Seruitio.</hi> With which garnisons he hath most vexed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> townes cituated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the hart of the countrie: leauing the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and other places of importance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any garison, whereby in some places, thinges are come to alteration: besides that by reason of lacke of paye, his Spanish soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirurs are fallen into a most licentious and vnspeakable order of life, threatning, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, robbing, spoyling, and by all maner of
<pb facs="tcp:20721:14"/>
cruell exactions vsing your subiects: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is manifest, that vnder pretence of your Maiesties name and religion, he setteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to fill his gréedie and bloudthirstie appetite, being to the contrarie most noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious that he hath so little regard to the ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uice of our Maiestie, as to the maintenance of the common weale of the low countries, which he suffreth vtterly to perish and goe to ruine.</p>
            <p>But what néedeth it with wordes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse this, as if he had not sufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested whereunto his procéedings haue tended, shewing it being blinded with his most vnsatiable presumptiousnes &amp; desire of vaine glory: as in a token of a <hi>Tropheum</hi> or signe of victory in his notorious procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, as before rehearsed, hath caused to be erected within the castell of <hi>Andwarpe,</hi> a bra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son Image standing vpon the nobilitie and states of the countrie. We leaue now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rehearsed what his meaning was thereby, but when, or where, hath it bene séene that any Tirant in his life time hath caused any such Image to be erected. We find that the <hi>Romaine Emperours</hi> and Kynges, which in a maner had brought the whole world vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der their subiection, haue sometimes caused to be erected Images of brasse, and stone: as at this present the Popes of <hi>Roome</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:20721:14"/>
pretend to be God his vicar, yet it is done by ordinaunce and consent of the counsell, &amp; commons, or at the least by their aduise and suffrance: but that they in their life time haue done such, is not to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by any exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Cronicles, considering it to be a ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifest token of madde arrogantie and insup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>portable pride: we find onely that <hi>Nabucho donozar</hi> who caused him self to be honoured as a God, set vp the like Image, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all men to knéele and bowe vnto the same: yet durst he not do it but by consent of the chiefe and nobles of his countrie.</p>
            <p>But this Tirant doth aswell in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpteous arrogantie as in execrable tira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie surpasse al other tirants: who as though he would not onely aduaunce himselfe to the roome of the kyng, but likewise in God his place: hath without the aduise, counsell, or ordinance of any, in his life time erected this proud Image, to the defacing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of your Maiesties dignitie, shewing therby his force and tyranny wherwith hée hath subdued and brought vnder foote these countries.</p>
            <p>And in like maner he hath not bene afraid following the example of the tirant <hi>Herode:</hi> to place himselfe vpon the market place of <hi>Andwarpe</hi> in your Maiesties stoole &amp; cloth of estate: which neuer had ben touched by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:20721:15"/>
Liuetenant before, sitting there repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the absence of your Maiestie, as an Idoll, and vnder pretence of publishing of a pardon: which neuer Quéene, Duke, or any Gouernours or Gouernaunts of these countries haue done the like: tending to the manifest disestimation and abasing of your Maiesties honour and dignitie.</p>
            <p>These procéedings, most soueraigne king are become so apparant and euident vnto al the world, that all straunge nations, and Potentates, haue a terrour and execration therat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> insomuch as euen the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> his souldiours, and seruants, do protest and say, that they can not esteeme such for good, much lesse that the seruice of your Maiestie, and welfare of the countrie, should therin consist.</p>
            <p>Besides that we can not thinke that your Maiestie being therof sufficiently and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infourmed, would permit such forces and violences, for it was neuer heard that any King or Potentate, hath so vnmercifully dealt with his subiects: your Maiesties aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cetours of most famous memorie, haue in most milde and gentle maner behaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues towardes their subiectes, that they haue therof giuen a most laudable example not onely to their successours, but also to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christian Princes, Dukes, &amp; rulers,
<pb facs="tcp:20721:15"/>
that whensoeuer any discention was risen betwéene the subiects and Magestrates, by reason of misgouernement, &amp; taken armes in hand: and being againe brought vnder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience by their Lordes and rulers, were neuer molested with these examples of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, but by expresse capitulation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word, to word, confirmed all their priuileges and liberties, and the same to enioye their full effect.</p>
            <p>So as wée shoulde greatly wrong your Maiestie, if we should persuade our selues that your Maiestie were so farre diuerted from the example of your predecessours, &amp; from the duetie of all other Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Potentates, that in steade of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string right and Iustice to your obedient subiects, and giuing audience to their most pitifull complaints, shuld send such a tirant in such sort cruelly to murther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the countrie, and burthening your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects with most intollerable slauery, serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and thraldome.</p>
            <p>And now the sayd Duke presenting vnto vs his fained pardons, vnder the name of your Maiestie for our rebellions and misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours (as he termeth them) we coulde not accept the same without depriuing of your Maiesties dignitie.</p>
            <p>Knowing well that your Maiestie will
<pb facs="tcp:20721:16"/>
not, before hauing heard the iustnesse of our cause condemne vs of rebellion. Where is there any that iustly hath infourmed your Maiestie of our dealings, or when did euer your Maiestie giue eare vnto any, but such as were our manifest enemies? Reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth both partes to be heard, before sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence should be pronounced. And therfore in the Cronicles of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, is much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended: who whensoeuer he heard any parties, leaned with his head vpon his shoulders with one of his eares closed, and being asked why he so did, aunswered that the later partie ought aswell haue audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as the first, which order hath alwayes bene had in estimation of all nations, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conformable to all naturall rightes. So as no offendour, what gréeuous crimes so euer he had committed shalbe iudged or con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demned, but that he shall first aunswere vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to such accusations as are alleged against him.</p>
            <p>Now most mercifull &amp; soueraigne Lord and King, we doe most hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly prostrate our selues vnder the foot of your Maiestie, most hartely requesting the same, that it woulde please your Grace to bend towards vs one eare, and (as in a ballance) equally to weye our estates. Your Maiestie hath by postes, letters, and other meanes ben informed of
<pb facs="tcp:20721:16"/>
this present estate, and our mouthes haue ben closed vp, our tongues pearsed with red burning Irons, and our lippes seared vp with burning tonges, because we shuld not giue our necessitie to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. The waies haue as yet ben taken from vs, so that our lamentable cryes could neuer come vnto, or pearse the eares of your Maiestie.</p>
            <p>How then can your Maiestie condempne vs of rebellion (which always we haue had in hatred) because that the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> doth séeke to bring vs vnder his subiection with his letters of pardon, and wée nothing estéeming of the same: which he perceyuing and that with force hée cannot (by God hys prouidence) preuayle, we cannot therfore ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept his said letters as being directed to vs who neuer strayed from your obedience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were that we would take &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> for our King: for him onely haue we resisted &amp; not your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, whom we with life and goods (so long as it shall please God to permit vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same) will faithfully serue and obeye. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth nothing touch vs, which tendeth onely to the Townes which haue ben seduced from the Kings obedience. But we marke his intent, knowing that eyther hee would be king himselfe, or else that wée by entiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his subtile pardons shoulde
<pb facs="tcp:20721:17"/>
condempne our selues. For wée receyuing pardon, must acknowledge our selues gilty of commotions and rebellion agaynst oure King, of tumult and sedition, yea of heresie and declyning from the Christian faith, and in fyne, to the depriuinge of the honour of God and the Kings maiestie. This is hys seeking, that by receyuing of his false &amp; fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, we shuld by our subsignations &amp; seales confirme the same, to the intent that hée hereafter might thereby defende and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse himselfe of tyranny before your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and all other christian Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, saying, that if we had not founde ourselues culpable in these gréeuous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for which we were punished and torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, we would neuer haue receyued any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse or pardon.</p>
            <p>Wherein wée take God, the searcher and knower of all hartes, and your Maiestie to witnesse, that if wée haue committed any such offences, as by the sayd pardon are layd to our charge, that wée doe altogither refuse all pardon, but desire as the moste wickedst and vylest creatures on earth, to make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our offences with our bloud, and doe not refuse, O most mercifull King, one after an other, to suffer most extreeme tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if it may be found that wee haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in such order as is presumed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20721:17"/>And do request the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> (if any petition will take place with him) that all such as come to him for pardon, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the pretended offence, that hée without shewing of mercy, doe entreat them in such sorte as their offences (according to righte) haue deserued, commending him therein in gyuing or mayntayning any fayth or credit with him as one so vnfaithfull to God &amp; his King, as hath not ben abashed so greatly too abuse and contempne their Maiesties.</p>
            <p>But what is it, it shall not be found that euer we haue thoght any such matter, much lesse in effect shewed the same. We haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bene faithfull and seruiseable to our King, and sought to serue God, the father of our Lord Iesus Christ in spirit and truth, according to his word and commaundment, so farre as our féeble nature would permit, euen to the last droppe of our bloud.</p>
            <p>But considering that the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> in stead of executing equitie and Iustice, and hearing of their complaintes and gréefes, &amp; persecutinge of your maiesties promises, hath contrary to all right and reason, &amp; our rightes and priuileges, suppressed vs wyth most cruell tyrannie, destroyed oure Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and vsed vs more seuerely, then euer <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Turkes</hi> haue done against their van<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quished enemies. And in the meane space,
<pb facs="tcp:20721:18"/>
hath hée accused vs to your Maiestie, and al other christian Potentates with false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of rebellion and heresie: and we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer could come to our aunswer, or receyue any comfort in the vniuersall world. So as by necessitie we haue ben forced to take the armes in hande, and by all meanes possible sought to defende our poore natiue Country from such execrable tyrannie: and rather w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> one accord to spende our lyues, then to fall into the handes of such a Tyrant: wherein wée meane to persiste, except that it please your Maiestie with mercyfull cares to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to our complaintes, and minister to vs Iustice against such oppression and tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For God be thanked, we are not so il in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in his word, but that we know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, that aswell our lyfe as death consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in his handes, &amp; that this death which no man can escape, is but as a ready path too the lyfe euerlasting.</p>
            <p>Therefore, séeing our death maye bée a pleasure to other, wee chuse rather to dye an honorable death in the behalfe of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and common weale of our Country, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fall into such seruitude, and become foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stooles vnto most arrogant aliants, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes haue hated vs. For at the least wée shall thereby leaue to our successors suche a good fame, as it may be sayd, that their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours
<pb facs="tcp:20721:18"/>
had rather with renowne to dye with honour, then lyue in all bondage and shame.</p>
            <p>Wée contende for the libertie of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, in defence of our wyues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, our bloude and goods, that is to saye, whether the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices shall according to his selfe will bée a Lord and Gouernour, or that wée to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe of your Maiestie, O most Souerayne King, shall defende it from him. We know that the limites of our liues are set, and shal not by the pardon of the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe the same. Therefore wée onely desire your Maiestie, that it may please the same to weye and consider our cases, and not to suffer, that wee by accepting such pardones, should for euer be reputed as rebels to God and our King, which we neuer thought.</p>
            <p>For wée are fully perswaded, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although wee had receyued those pardons, yet would it nothing haue preuayled for safegarde of our lyues, for thereby the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> might haue had the better action against vs the proceeded with most seueritye, &amp; might had better haue answered for himselfe, if we and confessed our selues gilty of rebellion, both against God &amp; the King his Maiestie. For then no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would haue moned vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we had bene slayne and murthered
<pb facs="tcp:20721:19"/>
as disturbers of the peace and common wealth and not worthy to lyue.</p>
            <p>And although it were not so, yet it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant by all the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges, that he meaneth to obserue no faith with vs, for seeing that he hath openly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated the othe which the Duches of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> with all the Lordes and gouernours of the countrie, in the name of your Maiestie, had sworne so solemply to these townes: yet hath he in these latter warres, sufficiently expressed his peruerse meaning in diuers townes, as at <hi>Mons</hi> in <hi>Henauld</hi> hath he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his othe, caused a number of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geses to be hanged, at <hi>Naerdon</hi> he hath exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted his crueltie in such a sort as in a town of like bignes hath not ben hard of: and now at <hi>Harlem</hi> hath he or at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> least in his name, <hi>Don Frederico</hi> assured the souldiours of their liues, &amp; therunto certaine Lords as pledges they bound themselues: and yet hath he eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the young paiges, caused them to be mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thered one with another, and their naked carcasses to the scandale of all women, and virgins, left lying vpon the scaffold a day &amp; a night. And such as had consented to the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liuery of the towne, and were entred into his seruice, hath he caused to be caried to the Galies, and vpon the Fuycke before <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> when he had promised the souldiours
<pb facs="tcp:20721:19"/>
their liues, suffred them to perish with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, saying: that he had assured them of their liues, and not of meate and drinke. As also the Burgeses of <hi>Harlem,</hi> whom he had assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their liues, hath he compelled to be My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners before the towne of <hi>Alkmar,</hi> where they are by the inhabitants slayne: which doth passe all barbarous tiranny and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and is a most manifest token wherwith he séeketh to maintaine his vntrue procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges.</p>
            <p>So that it is euident that he meaneth not to obserue any othes or promises, but for a small time: to the entent he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter haue his will of others, and because hée might the better hereafter defend his case, against your Maiestie, and other Princes, doth produce this pardon, for if we do accept the same we must néedes acknowledge our selues giltie of such offences, as he layeth to our charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is not bound to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of any othe: for by the counsell holden at <hi>Constance,</hi> it was aboue ij. hunderd yeres enacted that no faith is to be kept with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques.</p>
            <p>For wheras he doth in his pardon subtilly alleadge that such offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces as haue bene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, were done more vpon euill sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin, and euill will, then of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and enclination. This is but a subtill
<pb facs="tcp:20721:20"/>
pollicie, wherwith he ment to disceaue the simple, and bring them vnder his yoke: and to furnish himselfe of power to suppresse all such as he thinketh good, and that without reproch of any, séeing that it standeth in his iudgement who hath offended, the premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or not.</p>
            <p>But once consider most soueraigne King, how that the righteous GOD hath decea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued this subtile dealer in his procedings, for in this pardon wherin he pretendeth most gréeuously to accuse vs, he doth by expresse wordes confesse, that he can by no meanes thinke that we could not haue bene so alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or chaunged, but vppon euill suggestion or els we shuld haue continewed in al faith and willingnesse, which we alwayes haue shewed to your Maiestie.</p>
            <p>For if it be so, that we before this last of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence (as he termeth it) haue shewed to your Maiestie all obedience as he himselfe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth? Why hath he then vsed such cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and persecution? Wherefore hath hée in such sorte distroyed the townes, burned the the villages, and places: murthered the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and spoyled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all their goods, hath not he by his souldiours by fyre consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Catwicke</hi> vpon Zea, <hi>Sandwicke and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen,</hi> &amp; that long before these transgressions, wherof he complayneth, were begone. Did
<pb facs="tcp:20721:20"/>
not they pretend to set fyre on the towne of <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> which was so well addicted vnto them, haue not they in <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where as they were receaued as fréends, cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thered a number of Burgeses, was not fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by <hi>Pacheco</hi> a bill of innumerable number, aswell of the nobilitie, as most substantiall commons in sundrie and diuers townes, which by commaundement of the Duke should haue bene murthered, if matters by Gods prouision had not altered. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto tended the demaund of the tenth penie, to none other end but that we should at his handes buy our goods, which he pretended to be confiscated: whereby it appeareth that he and his adherents are sworne enemies vnto your Maiestie: whilest he doth in such sort execute his tiranny, murther, burning, and with such force and seruitude, doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeue vs your subiects, whom he himselfe doth alleage to haue bene most faithfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your maiestie. So as through necessitie we haue ben compelled to enter into armes to resist his force and tiranny: which his ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uants could not denie, who diuers times haue sayd that they would so long vexe and trouble this countrie and inhabitants ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that in the end they should be forced to rebell, and so haue occasion to bring it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der subiection, &amp; spoyle the same of all their
<pb facs="tcp:20721:21"/>
substance: which is to be approued by some letters, wherby was written, that this it was for which they longed. It is very trew most soueraigne King, that the Duke doth heare alleage, as that your subiects would neuer had rebelled, but vpon suggestion of certaine euill disposed, which euill disposed are none other then the Duke himself, with his bloudy counsel, and sanguine adherents, which of meare set, euill will, and vnsatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble auarice, haue sucked the sweate &amp; bloud of your subiects, &amp; of long time so earnestly persecuted, and gréeued to the vttermost, that they for defence of themselues, their wiues, children, and all that which in this world they do estéeme of, haue bene forced to take armes in hand: Therfore where as he presumeth that he hath so louingly dealt with other townes, take example by <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, Valencien, Lysle, Jpre, Maestricht, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenter,</hi> and likewise by <hi>Machlin, Oudenard, Dermonde, and Naerden,</hi> where they haue by murthering, robbing, hanging, rauish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of women, and with diuers outrages persecuted the poore commons.</p>
            <p>Besides this hath there bene murthered at <hi>Bruxels</hi> at sundry times aboue CC. and xxx. Burgeses, and that long before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of these warres, as also in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> which happened amongst
<pb facs="tcp:20721:21"/>
the Spaniards, where of the commons haue bene slaine LX. or LXX. besides an infinite number of men and women<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times haue bene murthered, which we leaue to enlarge here séeing those their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedinges are accompted mercifull dealings besides other most wicked insolences vsed in the said townes.</p>
            <p>And therefore hée néedeth not to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vs, that if wée do not accept his pardon, that no rigour which may be deuised, shalbe left vnexercised towardes our persones, by desolation, honger and sword, in such sorte, as no remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce shalbe left of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. For wée are certaine, that here about hée hath sought as much as is to him possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and would vndoubtedly haue vsed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crueltie (whereof hée boasteth so much) if the feare which hée hath, that the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries would not any longer abyde his crueltie, had not letted him.</p>
            <p>Hée doth not so much estéeme the seruice of your Maiestie, nor regardeth your heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage &amp; countries, as that hée would abstayn from ruining and destroying the same: yea vtterlye to roote out the reliques and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories thereof, so farre as it were to him possible, as the burning &amp; desolating which hée before these warres, hath vsed, doe suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently beare witnesse. But wée truste that
<pb facs="tcp:20721:22"/>
the almighty God will neuer suffer y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> your Maiestie should permit your Countries al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither to fall into the force of suche a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and destroyer.</p>
            <p>For, whereas hée here alleadgeth that we haue put on armes agaynst your Maiestie: that wée vtterly denie. For wée proteste before your Maiestie, yea before God &amp; hys Angells, that our meaning or prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was neuer such. For wée wil adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur our selues and all that wée haue in this world, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse we haue don towards your Maiesties predecessours, with lyfe and goods to stande to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of your maiestie against al your enemies and ill willers.</p>
            <p>But this wée will acknowledge before the vniuersall world, that (being thereunto extremely constrayned) wée haue taken armes in hand agaynst the tyranny and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses of the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plices, to deliuer our lyues and goods, wyues and children from the bloudthirstie hands of his ministers: and if hée doo preuayle agaynste vs, rather chuse to dye an honorable death, and leaue a fame to our successours, then to yéelde and bowe to such a tyrant, and suffer our countrie to liue vnder vnsupportable slauerie. So else we should be abashed and ashamed too shewe our faces in any other Countries, as hauing neglected the seruice
<pb facs="tcp:20721:22"/>
of your Maiestie. And therefore haue all the Townes ioinctly and seuerally taken in hande and sworne the one after the other, to abyde al sieges, if néed bée, to the vttermost, though to the losse of their lyues and goods: yea rather set fyre of our owne howses, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to yéeld to the force of this Tyrant.</p>
            <p>For wée are well assured, that at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of such a Tyrant, as regardeth no othe, and hath so often and cruelly threatned vs, there is no more to be looked for, but that he wold rather colour the riuers and streames with our blood, and to behange the countrie with our bodyes, to satiate his bloudthirsty luste and appetite.</p>
            <p>Therfore we prostrate our selues before the féete of your Maiestie, desiring the same for GOD his sake, who hath set y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Crowne vppon your head, and gyuen the Scepter into your hande once to bowe your eares to our reasonable complayntes. Wée doe not desire to be dissolued from the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of your Maiestie, but onely that we may haue our consciences frée to Godwarde, to heare his holy worde, &amp; to follow the same, to the intent to giue an accompt at the daye of Iudgement of our soules, &amp; that we may atcheue such discharge for our miserable na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiue Countrie, which alwayes hath donne such faythful seruice to your Maiestie, from
