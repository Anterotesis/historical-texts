         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore I wishe all faithfull christians to foresée and so to prouide in tyme, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther popishe Antichrist, nor any rable of false vsurped powers shall once be able to spurne or kicke against the veritie and true professours of the same. The holy apostle S. Iames speaketh ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry louingly vnto all suche as geueth their mindes to godly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and study, saying these wordes. <hi>My brethren counte it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioy when ye fall into diuers temptations, forasmuch as you know how that the trying of your faith bringeth pacience, and let patience haue her perfect worke, that ye may be perfect and sounde lacking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Herein the apostle sheweth vnto all men, that by patience we must moderate our selues, as if the enemy shew rigorousnes ortiranny, winne him by patience, but vse no superbitie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but yeld the cause vnto god, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which iudgeth rightly, and he will in tyme be a defence vnto all such oppressed. <hi>Vir du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex animo inconstans est in omnibus vijs suis,</hi> a waueryng mynded ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is vnstable in all his wayes. But most happy is that man that endureth in temptation, for when he is tried, he shall receiue the crowne of life which the lord hath promised to those which loue him, and erre not my dere brethren. Euery good gift

and euery perfect gift is from aboue, and commeth downe from the father of light, with whome is no variablenes, neither is he chaunged into darkenes. Of his owne will begate he vs wyth the worde of lyfe, that we should be the first fruites of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so that as long as we obey his preceptes and be zealous furtherers of his gospell, and alwayes continuing, then shall all such doers be assured of most happy saluation. Herein is plainly shewed vnto all, the estate of euery degrée by order of picture and signification, to the intent, that therby euery christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may the better sée the disordred abuses which daily raueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest vs, and also the state of obedience by euery picture in like sorte signified, that thereby euery Christian may the better beware the deceiuable suggestions of Sathan, that neither par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don nor mumming, massinges or any other popish ceremonies, can any thing auayle as touchyng saluation: for if it were so, then Christes death was in vayne, and of none effect. Take hede therfore &amp; cleaue betyme to Christ &amp; his doctrine, &amp; leaue of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; faynings of men, &amp; vse the counsail of the holy apostle S.

But these speake euill of those they know not, &amp; what thynges they know naturally, as beasts which are without reason, in those thinges they corrupt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Woe be vnto them, for they haue followed the way of Balaam for lukers sake, and perishe in the treason of Chore. These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their owne lustes, whose mouthes speake proude thinges. They haue men in great reuerence because of aduauntage. But ye beloued, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the wordes which were spoken before, of the apostles of our Lorde Iesus Christ, how that they tolde you that there should be beguilers in the last tyme, which should walke in their vngodly lustes, these are makers of sectes fleshly, hauing no spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, pray therfore dearely beloued, that God so roote out al such enemies which kicke against the truth of his gospell, &amp; so arme

In the meane season applying our mindes to the study of vertue, may be rich and plentifull in righteousnes and hope of saluation. And for that your myndes among many and earnest pensiue and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful studies might be reuiued also in vertue.

Hope here is not alone, but is ioyned with fayth and charitie, so that the one cannot be without the other, neither the one to haue the lacke of the other: For as Faith cannot be iustified without workes, no more can hope without charitie: for as faith without wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes is deade, so is hope without charitie deade also.

faithfull hope there is alwayes constant charitie, the which worketh so diligently that she neuer seaseth, but is still labouring by all meanes to helpe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue all such as of her hath neede.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as the Antichristians haue a place among themselues imagined, a place the which the call purgatory, and so affirming it, and that through their power they are able to bringe soules departed out of hell into theyr purgatory, and also to sende soules thether at theyr pleasure and will, I haue thought good to search the scriptures, to the intent to see if there had bene any such word or place, as by their writings is alleaged, &amp; there is neither word nor place in such sort to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. But sith they affirme such a place to be, I thinke in dede, as many as goe thether, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are deade, do leaue their winding shetes behinde, for at oke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which semeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such Prelates may put y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more cloth in their Ephod &amp; Tunicle, and Rochet, els it is to be thought tohse relickes should not be made so holy. And for the auoyding of such superstitious imaginations, I haue thought good to nominate so many places of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as do alow this third place, which they cal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, but nought there is to be founde as hereafter folowing in thys sayde chapiter more at large shalbe shewed. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Euangelist S. Mathew is written these wordes, she shall bring forth a sonne, and thou shalt call his name Iesus: for he shall saue his people from their sinnes, all this was done to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill that which was spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lord by the prophet Esay in his viij. chapiter, saying: Beholde a mayde shalbe with childe and shall bringforth a sonne, and
<pb facs="tcp:15797:74"/>
they shall call his name Emanuell, which is by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation God with vs, which name was geuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, because he being God was as Paul wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth found like vnto vs in all thinges, sinne onely excepted. Also in the <hi>2.</hi> chapiter of S. Marke the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist is written these wordes, when Iesus saw their faith, he sayde to the sicke of the paulsey, sonne thy sinnes are forgeuen thee, and there were certayne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scribes sitting there &amp; reasoned in their hartes saying, how doth this felow blaspheme, who can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue sinnes, but God onely. Herein they shewed themselues altogether ignoraunt, not crediting him, for all the miracles that he had done and shewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, in like doth the Pope and his fraternity, beholde the scriptures but nothing at all vse them as they ought to do, but altogether to their owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, in as much as they haue done and do mayntayne a purgatory, a place to punishe soules in, after they be departed this life at their pleasures, which is nothing but mere falshod and deceit, ye and also are not ashamed to say that by vertue of trentall Masses, pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and dirgies, they are able to redeme those that are passed this life from all paynes and tormentes. O wretched congregation, o generation of vipers, that are not ashamed so superbiously to brage and so arrogantly seeke to deface the truth of the liuing God, for as there is but one true and liuing God, no more is there any other sauiour and rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer then God in Christ Iesus, which suffred for all men vniuersally, and he it is that worketh our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and none but he. <hi>Si quis peccauerit aduocatum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus</hi>
