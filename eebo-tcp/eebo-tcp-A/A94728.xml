         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Love not ſiding in Gods Church, among Chriſts Miniſters eſpecially, I love
not, I am for this man, and I am for that man: I am for this ſide, and I am for
that ſide. The Apoſtle himſelfe liked it not, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 12. Rom.</hi> 16. 18. I love not
holding the faith of Chriſt with reſpect of perſons. Another Apoſtle forbids it,
<hi>Iames</hi> 2. 1. I love not that any be tied to follow any one man, or any number of men
whatſoever in all things. The Apoſtles themſelves required it not in matter of fact,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. nor may any now living in matters of faith. Hence proceeded ſchiſmes,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. and 11. 18, 19. and factions, and uncharitabble cenſures, many
times of thoſe as unſound, that are it may be, more ſincere, have at leaſt as good
a ſhare in Chriſt, as thoſe that ſo cenſure them. And ſurely if the words hereſie
and heretick were rightly underſtood, or if they be ſo taken (as I ſuppoſe them
to be conſtantly uſed in Scriptute; nor doe I thinke that the contrary can be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
evinced) the one for faction, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 17. and 15. 5. and 24. 5, 14. and 26. 5.
and 28. 22. 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 18, 19. Gal.</hi> 5. 20. the other for a factious perſon, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10.
none I feare will be found more truly guilty of hereſie, or better to deſerve the title
of heretick, then thoſe, who (therein concurring with the Papiſts, whom yet they
profeſſe moſt to abhorre) are ſo prone to contemne all as hereticks, and tainted
with hereſie in their ſence, that is, as men cut off from Chriſt, and having no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in him, who doe not in all matters of practiſe comply, or in all points of
doctrine concurre with themſelves. Or their ſide, Lord, let me never be: let my
ſoule never enter into their ſecret. Neither is it, nor ſhall ever be my deſire, either
ſo to pin my faith upon the ſleeve of any part or party, or to engage my judgement
to any meere mans or mens opinions (the Pen-men of holy writ only excepted)
as to admit hand over head, whatſoever he or they ſhall hold and maintaine: nor
yet againe to refuſe or reject any truth, which by the light that God ſhall be pleaſed
to ſend me, I ſhall be able to deſcry in the writing of any, though otherwiſe never
be erroneous or unſound.</p>

marke at which we ſhoote may appeare to you, let the fixed point
be this; <hi>Chriſtians may not glory in men;</hi> if they doe, its their ſin,
and that no ſmall one in Gods ſight. God hath ſo ordered our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 29. that no fleſh ſhould glory in his

let not the rich man glory in his riches, but let him that glorieth
glory in this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth me, that I am

               <head>Glorying in men here forbidden, is glorying in the
Teachers of the Church.</head>
               <p>THe Greeke word tranſlated [<hi>glory</hi>] doth ſometimes ſignifie
the inward eſteeme, joy, content, complacency and confidence
we have in a thing, eſpecially when 'tis ſuperabundant, though it
be not outwardly expreſſed, but for the moſt part, it notes a full
joy, confidence, eſteeme or acquieſcence, expreſſed by words, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſignes. Glorying in men, is either when the perſons glorying,
and gloried in, are the ſame, or when they are divers; the former
is, when a man glories in himſelfe, and then it is, when a man out
of high eſteeme of his own excellency or power, expreſſeth confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in himſelfe, or praiſe of himſelfe, which is commonly the vice
of vaine boaſting, though it may be ſometimes for juſt cauſe, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:158483:5"/>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18. But in this place the latter, to wit the glorying in
other men is forbidden, as the reaſon ſhewes, for they were not to
glory in ſome as peculiarly theirs, becauſe all were theirs. And ſo
to glory in men, is to glory in other men, whom we conceive to
have ſingular excellency, and our ſelves to have ſome proper intereſt
in them, or relation to them, and accordingly to boaſt of them,
and the conceived property we have in them. Thus men glory in
their Anceſtours, Princes, Generals, Teachers: And the glorying in
this laſt ſort of men particularly as Teachers or Preachers of the
Goſpell, is here forbidden, as the occaſion of this precept ſhewes;
for this precept was given upon occaſion of their glorying men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<hi>chap.</hi> 1. 12, and the firſt inſtance, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. is of eminent
Teachers of the Church, <hi>Paul, Apollos, Cephas;</hi> ſo that the glorying

that in this place all Interpreters almoſt conceive a fiction,

ſuch a fiction ſhould be here made, I conceive to be againſt plaine
and evident reaſon. For firſt if this be ſo, then it is to be conceived
that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did not indeed call themſelves by the name

the relation of this ſchiſme from thoſe of <hi>Cloe,</hi> that the Apoſtle
intended to ſet downe a hiſtory of that they did, now in narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of facts done, no man uſeth ſuch a fiction. 2. He uſeth the
name of Chriſt without a fiction, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. in the ſame relation:
ſurely then the names of thoſe Apoſtles too. 3. To make it yet
clearer, he uſeth arguments to diſſwade them from theſe ſchiſmes
in his name. And to cleare himſelfe as no occaſion or abettour of
them, though his name were uſed, he alledgeth a thing or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
meerely perſonall, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15, 16, 17. 4. When <hi>chap.</hi> 3, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
ſpeakes againe of their ſchiſme, he adds to convince them of the

is</hi> Paul? <hi>and who is</hi> Apollo? <hi>but Miniſters by whom ye believed,

that he planted, and</hi> Apollos <hi>watered, but God gave the increaſe.</hi>
Now theſe things are true of <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe and <hi>Apollos</hi> himſelfe,
as we reade, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. not of any falſe Apoſtles. 5. To which I

               <p>AS for the objection from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. it is grounded upon an
interpretation that is not congruous to the words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle:
For 1. the Apoſtle is ſuppoſed to have put his and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's</hi>

thoſe things to himſelfe and <hi>Apollo's</hi> for the <hi>Corinthians</hi>

               <p>To this I anſwer, 1. Negatively, 2. Affirmatively. Negatively

in aſſuring us of the will of God, and in eſtabliſhing the
Churches. For as they had doubtleſſe ſingular power in working

truth is come, he will guide you into all truth, for he ſhall not
speake of himſelfe; but whatſoever he ſhall heare, that ſhall he
speake, and he will ſhew you things to come.</hi> 2. That it is not the
giving of that regard to the true Teachers, which is due to them as
Miniſters of Chriſt. For the Elders that rule well, are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
worthy of double honour, eſpecially they who labour in
the word and doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. 3. That it is not the proper

               <head>And affirmatively.</head>
               <p>AFfirmatively I ſay, here is forbidden inordinate glorying in
men which are Teachers, and this is ſundry wayes; 1. When
ſome Teachers are gloried in peculiarly, as if they were the only
Teachers worth the hearing, none elſe to be regarded. And that
this is the ſpeciall branch of glorying in men here forbidden, is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:158483:7"/>
manifeſt from the Apoſtles reaſon why the <hi>Corinthans</hi> ſhould not
glory in men: <hi>becauſe all were theirs, whether Paul, or Apollos,
or Cephas.</hi> It may ſeeme that ſome of them accounted <hi>Paul</hi> the
only Teacher, for his ſingular knowledge in the myſtery of Chriſt,
of which we reade, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 3, 4. Some delighted only in <hi>Apollos,</hi>
becauſe of his eloquence, of which we reade, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 24. Some
magnified <hi>Peter,</hi> as <hi>non-paril,</hi> whether by reaſon of his fervency
and zeale, or his ſeeming dignity among the Apoſtles, which
ſeemes to be intimated, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 11. Gal.</hi> 2. 9. Now this branch
of inordinate glorying in men, the Apoſtle doth ſtudiouſly forbid,
as conſidering that this was the egge out of which their conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were hatched, and perhaps foreſeeing that in time, out of it
would ſpring Prelaticall greatneſſe, and Antichriſtian tyranny;
therefore the Apoſtle forbids this, 1 <hi>Cor. 4 6. that they ſhould be
puffed up for one againſt another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſo it is uſuall for hearers to take
an inordinate affection, to have an inordinate eſteeme of ſome
Preachers, and thereupon to count them theirs, to glory to be
their followers, diſdaining all others as not to be named with
them, though Teachers of truth: becauſe they have an high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of their learning, wit, eloquence, holineſſe or the like quality.
2. When the ſo-magnified Teachers, are eſteemed not as ſervants
to a higher Maſter, but as Maſters themſelves. And that thus it
was with thoſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> it may be gathered in that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
doth ſo diligently admoniſh them to looke higher then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
or <hi>Apollos,</hi> that they might not eſteeme them authours of
their faith. Thus 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13. he expoſtulates with them, <hi>Is
Chriſt divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized
in the name of Paul?</hi> And <hi>chap. 2. 1, 5. when I came to you, I
came not with excellency of ſpeech or of wiſedome, that your faith
ſhould not stand in the wiſedome of men, but in the power of God:</hi>
and chap. 3. 5, 6, 7. <hi>who then is Paul? and who is Apollos? but
Miniſters by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every
man. I have planted, Apollos watred, but God gave the increaſe;
ſo then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth,
but God that gives the increaſe:</hi> and 1 Cor. 4. 6. <hi>that ye
might learne in us, not to think above that which is written.</hi> Now
this ſin is very incident to many hearers, when they admire ſome
Teachers wit, eloquence, zeale, holineſſe or the like quality, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
their converſion, edification to them; to praiſe them ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:158483:7"/>
to aſſume their names, forgetting that they are but Gods
inſtruments, and Chriſts ſervants, and that their graces come not
from the abilities of the Teacher, but the power of Chriſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. expoſtulates thus with theſe <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians:
for who maketh thee to differ from another? and what haſt
thou that thou didſt not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why
doeſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi>

               <p>The firſt I ſhall take from the text it ſelfe, <hi>becauſe all things

your ſelves unworthy of the great bounty of Chriſt unto you,
in giving all the Miniſters of the Goſpell to be yours for your good,
when ye glory in ſome, and unthankfully deſpiſe others. and ye
doe unbeſeeming your priviledge who are Chriſts, not <hi>Pauls,</hi> when
ye account <hi>Paul</hi> the maſter of your faith, not Chriſt; magnifie him

to a bountifull Prince, when he beſtowes many Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips

ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
and teachers, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. for the uſe of his people, to dote
on one, and to aſcribe to him that which is due to Chriſt the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
donour: for hereby the bounty of Chriſt is leſſened, and
the honour due to him ſubſtracted. 2. There's injury done both to
Chriſt, and to the deſpiſed Teachers. To our Lord Chriſt, in that
the glory that belongs to Chriſt alone to be the authour of, and to
have the dominion over our faith is aſcribed to men: for whereas
our Lord Chriſt forbad even the Apoſtles, <hi>Matth. 23. 8, 9, 10.
that they be not called Rabbi: for one is your Master even Chriſt,
and all ye are brethren; and call no man your father upon the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:158483:8"/>
earth, for one is your Father which is in Heaven: Neither be ye
called Masters; for one is your Maſter even Chriſt:</hi> by this
glorying in ſome Teachers they are made Rabbies, fathers on earth,
and Maſters. For what is it to make a man a Rabbi, a father on
earth, a Maſter, but to glory in him as the authour of our faith; to
eſteeme him as the only Teacher, to depend upon his mouth as if
he were another <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>

                  </gap>, that he hath ſaid were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough?
now what is this leſſe then to unchaire Chriſt, and to lift
up man into his ſeate, to deprive the ſhepheard and biſhop of our
ſoules, and ſubſtitute another in his roome? It is in effect all one as
to thanke the Axe for building the houſe, and to paſſe by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter.
For as <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> were but <hi>faithfull in Gods houſe
as ſervants, but Chriſt as a Sonne over his own houſe, whoſe houſe
we are,</hi> Heb. 3. 5, 6. 'Tis injurious alſo to the deſpiſed Teacher, in
that he is contemned, whom Chriſt hath honoured to make a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of truth, a ſervant of his: but this we ſhall further conſider
when we ſpeake of the reaſons from the effects of glorying in men.</p>

               <head>From the many pernicious effects that follow upon it.</head>
               <p>BUt the evill of this ſin is moſt cleerely ſeen in the pernicious
effects that are conſequent upon it, which are many: As 1. it
is a direct cauſe of ſchiſmes: ſo it was among theſe <hi>Corinthians;</hi>
their glorying in <hi>Paul, Apollos, Cephas,</hi> made them ſay, <hi>I am of
Paul, I am of Apollos, I am of Cephas:</hi> it cauſeth the people to
divide themſelves one from another, under different Teachers, in
whom they glory: and it cauſeth Teachers to ſever thoſe that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
them, from other teachers whom they affect not ſo much:
for <hi>occaſio facit furem,</hi> advantage to doe evill is a great incitement
to attempt it. Sundry are the cauſes of ſchiſmes, ſometimes the
pride, tyranny, heterodoxie of the Teachers, and then they are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable
in the people, the power of Paſtors not being Lordly, but
fatherly, <hi>pedo non ſceptro,</hi> not in a compulſory, but a directory
way: ſometimes the cauſeleſſe hatred or contempt of the people
towards ſome Paſtors; the vaine eſteeme, light affection towards
others cauſeth a ſchiſme; and then the Paſtours are free, the people
are under the guilt. And it is no ſmall ſin, whether from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
or peoples priding in guifts that a ſchiſme is made; whereas
the end of Gods Spirit in beſtowing of guifts is, that <hi>there might
be no ſchiſme in the body,</hi> but <hi>that the members ſhould have the
ſame care one for another,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 25. Now ſchiſmes are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Chriſtian unity and love, cauſe great alteration of heart in
one member from another, ſubſtraction of mutuall helps, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
in the growth of the body, neglect of praying one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
yea bitterneſſe, diſdaine, hatred, and the effects of theſe, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of ſociety, excommunicating each other, and at laſt violence,
and bloud, and theſe are bad enough.</p>
               <p>2. The prohibited glorying in men, doth expoſe the Chriſtian
profeſſion to obloquy and contempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for whereas it is the honour
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:158483:9"/>
of the Chriſtian profeſſion, <hi>that they have one body, one ſpirit, one
Lord, one faith, one baptiſme, one God and Father of all,</hi> Epheſ. 4.
5, 6. by the glorying in ſome Teachers afore others, the Chriſtian
ſociety is made like the ſeverall Schooles of Philoſophers, ſome fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Plato,</hi> ſome <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſome <hi>Zeno,</hi> ſome <hi>Epicurus;</hi> their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
accounted but as the proper opinions or placita of ſeverall
teachers; not proceeding from one and the ſame Spirit of God, but
ſingularity of conceit; and zeale for them is conceived to ariſe, not
from a certaine knowledge of heavenly truth, but from ſtrength of
fancie, and peculiar humour: which thing is a great ſtumbling block
to thoſe that are without, keeping them back from embracing the
truth, and an occaſion of laying open the profeſſion of it to deriſion.</p>
               <p>3. By glorying in men, as there is an over high eſteeme of the
guifts of ſome, ſo there is an undervaluing of the guifts of others:
which thing as it is an unworthy abuſe of thoſe various guifts Chriſt
giveth to his Church, ſo doth it inferre an injurious imputation to
the Spirit of God by whom they are beſtowed. For as it is ſaid,
Prov. 17. 5. <hi>Who ſo mocketh the poore, reproacheth his maker who
made him ſuch:</hi> ſo it may be ſaid by parity of reaſon; he that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeth
thoſe that are of ſmall guifts, reproacheth the Spirit of God,
as if he were defective in his guifts; whereas the variety of guifts,
and the beſtowing of them in different meaſures, ſets forth the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and freeneſſe of Gods Spirit, <hi>who worketh all thoſe, dividing
to every man ſeverally as he will,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 11.</p>
               <p>4. By the inordinate glorying in ſome, and deſpiſing of others,
the deſpiſed perſons are often diſcouraged and diſheartned, to the
detriment of the Church of God, and the grievance of the deſpiſed.
For the remembrance of contempt, is apt to cauſe dejectedneſſe
and griefe of heart, which alwayes benums a mans ſpirit, and enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
him, and clogges him in his work: Thus the heart is made ſad,
which ſhould not be made ſad; and the ſparke that ſhould be
blowne up by incouragements that it may flame forth, is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed,
and <hi>the Spirit quenched,</hi> contrary to the Apoſtles war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 19 20.</p>
               <p>5. By glorying in Teachers, it falls out that they are puffed up
and perverted: much experience hath confirmed this as true, that
popular applauſe hath filled Teachers with vaine glory, and made
them adulterate the word of God to pleaſe their auditors. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>
tells us of the falſe Apoſtles among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Gal. 4. 17. <hi>that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:158483:9"/>
they did zealouſly</hi> (in ſhew) <hi>affect them, but not well: intending
to ex<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lude him, that they might affect them.</hi> It is no ſtrange thing
that Teachers perceiving the lightneſſe of their auditors, and their
itching eares doe ſometimes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>handle the word
of God deceitfully,</hi> inſtead of miniſtring <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
milke of the word,</hi> as it is called, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. ſometimes flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
pleaſingly, when they ſhould reprehend ſharpely; ſometimes
balking the vice, they ſhould freely convince of; ſometimes inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
new formes of Teaching, new opinions, ſublimate conceites
to fit the deſires of the people; making the <hi>Leſbian rule</hi> of their
fancies, the meaſure of their teaching, and this is a grand evill.</p>
               <p>6. This glorying in men, begets an aptneſſe to receive their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
to imitate their actions, which is the ſeed of hereſies and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions:
for admiration and doting love to a perſon, eaſily
drawes the admirers to a blind obedience, implicit faith in them,
to an inſlaving of their judgements, ſo as <hi>jurare in verba Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri.</hi>
It is obſerved by an hiſtorian, that afore the miſcarriage of
<hi>Conrade</hi> the Emperour, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the French King, in their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

                  <hi>Bernards</hi> Sermons perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the people were too much tranſported with an high opinion
of him and his directions; as if that arrow could not miſſe the
marke that came out of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Bernards</hi> bowe. Any thing is eaſily
received from him that we over-much love. Affection makes men
take downe falſities, as the rowling in ſugar doth make the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
ſwallow bitter pills:<note place="margin">Cicero lib. 2. de oratore. Adverſ. haereſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cap. 15.</note> as it befell <hi>Fuſius,</hi> who ſo admired
<hi>Fimbria's</hi> eloquence, that he imitated withall his ill-favoured faces
and broad ſpeaking. And God doth often leave the admired Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
to erre, for triall of the people, as <hi>Vincent. Lixin.</hi> obſerves,
alleadging the ſpeech of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 3. and the admirers of them
to receive errour, according to his juſt judgement.</p>
               <p>7. Adde hereunto, that this gloring in men makes mens endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
remiſſe in things neceſſary, earneſt in things vaine; that time
and labour that ſhould be employed in the maine duties of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
in ſeeking the advancement of Chriſts Kingdome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, is often beſtowed in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
thoſe in whom they glory, upholding their party, promoting
their opinions: whence it is, that ſuch as are followers of thoſe in
whom they glory, conſtant hearers of them, much in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, have their ſayings and tenents <hi>ad unguem,</hi> declare
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:158483:10"/>
much zeale in their way, yet prove but unskilfull in the chiefe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Chriſtian religion, defective in the power of true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
in the mortifying of corruptions, ſuch as pride, impatience,
ſelf-conceitedneſſe, raſhneſſe, covetouſneſſe; and in the practice of
righteouſneſſe, mercy, meekneſſe, diligence in their own buſineſſe
and the like; in the provoking one another to love and good works.</p>
               <p>8. On the contrary, the word of God though ſoundly and truly
delivered, is neglected, being either not heard, or without fruit,
when it is ſpoken by ſuch a Teacher as they affect not, but diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
cenſured, contemned. The prejudice againſt one, through com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
extolling of another, cauſeth the teaching of the ſleighted
perſon, though orthodox, holy, learned, to be paſſed over, to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
as barren, dry, hungry ſtuffe, though it be the true word of
God, as if no teaching were wholeſome meate, but ſuch as is wet
with their affected Teachers ſpittle, I meane his phraſe, method,
action, elocution; as if <hi>fides aeſtimanda eſſet ex perſonis, non perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae
ex fide,</hi> as <hi>Tertullians</hi> phraſe is, or as if <hi>our faith ſtood not in
the power of God, but in the wiſedome of men,</hi> as the Apoſtle
ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 5.</p>
               <p>9. By this meanes the rule of Chriſtianity is changed; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the rule and ground of our faith and obedience is the word of
God as Gods word, through the addicting themſelves to ſome
mens authority, Gods truth ſtands at their devotion for its accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
hence they that of old gloried in the Phariſees as their Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,
regarded not Gods commands, but as pleaſed the Phariſees,
and they that this day glory in the Pope, or the Church as they call
it, regard the Scriptures ſo farre only as the Pope or Church allow
them, and they that depend on their magnified Teachers of any
other ſort, doe regard the word of God, but as it beares their image,
or comes from their mint; and ſo as it was ſaid of the heathens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
or diſallowing of gods by their Senates decree, <hi>Deus non
erit Deus, niſi homo velit, God ſhall not be God, unleſſe man will;</hi>
it may be ſaid in this caſe, Gods word ſhall not be Gods word, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
man will.</p>
               <p>10. Laſtly, They that glory in men, are either inconſtant in their
affections, as experience often ſhewes, they that one while would
pluck out their eyes for him whom they magnifie, will at another
time revile and hate him: for mens minds are mutable, and the
beſt of men are but men, that is, imperfect, and will be ſo found,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:158483:10"/>
and therefore will not alwayes ſatisfie, or elſe if they be ſtill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
yet they be but mortall, and the ſorrow for their loſſe will be
exceſſive, more then ſhould be for a creature, an arbitrary inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for immoderate affection to a thing while we have it, cauſeth
immoderate ſorrow for it when we looſe it.</p>

ſignes and ſymptomes of it are too manifeſt, diſparaging ſome Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
injuriouſly, extolling others immoderately, diſdainefully
withdrawing from ſome without juſt cauſe, inordinately running
after others without ſufficient reaſon; ſwallowing downe the
dictates of ſome without chewing, loathing the wholeſome food
which others preſent, without taſting. And have not the fruites
been among our ſelves, evill diviſions, janglings, evill cenſuring, and
ſuch like? ſcoffing, contempt, hardning of themſelves among our
adverſaries? Brethren, if there be any guilty of this ſin here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
let him now know it to be his ſin, and that no ſmall one, and
let him be humbled for it, and repent of it, that he may obtaine
pardon: poſſibly ſome godly perſons may have fallen into it, not
knowing it to be a ſin, but ſure I am, no one that feares God, will
dare to allow himſelfe in it being convicted that it is his ſin.</p>

                  <p>2. Wherefore in the ſecond place, give me leave to admoniſh
you, that you take heed of it. It is an evill that uſually doeth
follow thoſe Churches to which God beſtowes excellent gifts,
and worthy Teachers; and doubtleſſe the Lord hath inriched this
City with this moſt deſireable kind of riches above all places of
the earth; ſo that this City may be ſaid in this reſpect, to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
under the line, and the inhabitants here to be without ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
Great and many lights God hath given to you, and that in
many ſucceſſions a long time, <hi>uno avulſo non deficit alter,</hi> when
one is removed, God ſupplies you with another. But to what end
is it? not that you ſhould magnifie them, but uſe them to bring
you nearer unto God, not to glory in the gift, but to rejoyce in
the giver, reverence and make uſe of them, but reſerve to their
Lord his owne prerogative: may not you juſtly feare that God
will take them away from you, when you give his due to them?
we blame not a father if he remove a ſervant from his child, when
a child doeth inordinately affect him, to the deminution of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the father; nor can we God, if he ſubtract a good thing
which we abuſe: the beſt way to have good things continued by
God, is to uſe them for God, and to eſteeme them for his ſake;
but to ſet our hearts only on him that gave them. Beſides doth
not our glorying in men bring us into bondage to them? doth it
not inſenſibly draw upon us an adherence to their errours, if God
for our triall ſuffer them to ſlip into any, or if they have none, to
a dangerous and unſound diſpoſition to receive them if they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
We ſtand much for our Chriſtian liberty, and there is great
cauſe we ſhould, it is a pretious thing dearely bought, and is it
not one part of our Chriſtian liberty, that <hi>we be not the ſervants of
men, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 23. It concernes us then much, that we labour to
get ſuch a firme conſtitution of ſoule, that neither through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of underſtanding, nor through fooliſh affection we endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
our ſelves to hang on men, and ſo to bring our conſciences in
bondage to them. We account the yoake of Biſhops to have
been a grievous yoake, and that juſtly; if <hi>Hierome</hi> be not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
it was firſt occaſioned by this ſin of glorying in men;<note place="margin">Com on <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.</note> and
it may be feared leaſt this ſin may occaſion the keeping it on our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:158483:12"/>
necks: for is it not alleadged, take them away, men will follow
whom they pleaſe, ſo many ſchiſmes will be as Preachers? Any
of theſe reaſons, much more all of them, ſhould be a ſufficient
caveat unto you to warne you of this. I might preſſe this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
further, from the nature, cauſes and effects of this ſin before
ſhewed; but I will haſten to ſhut up all with a few directions to
prevent it.</p>
                  <p>1. Endeavour to have ample thoughts of Chriſt, his eminency,
his fullneſſe; the more high thy thoughts be of Chriſt, the lower
will thy conceits be of men, the larger comprehenſion thou haſt
of him, the leſſe wilt thou doate on his ſervants. A Courtier
when he is by himſelfe drawes mens eyes after him, but when he
is with the King he is ſcarcely obſerved. If thou behold Chriſt as
the great Prophet of the Church, <hi>in whom are hid all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of wiſedome and knowledge,</hi> Chriſt will only be gloried
in his ſervants only reſpected as his inſtruments and attendants.
Remember <hi>that he is made to us of God, wiſedome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and ſanctification, and redemption; that as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
he that glorieth might glory in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30, 31.</p>
                  <p>2. Have a right eſteeme of all true Paſtours and Teachers as the
Miniſters of Chriſt, ſo the Apoſtle requires, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 1. Let a
man account of us as Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the
mysteries of God,</hi> neither make more of them nor leſſe. Heare
them as meſſengers from Chriſt, not for their ſingular abilities,
but for their meſſage ſake; reſpect them not only for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
wit and elocution, but for their faithfullneſſe: note and
retaine not only fine ſpeeches, but every ſolid truth, that is from
God, leaſt while thou taſte the dainty ſawce, thou neglect the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
nouriſhment of thy ſoule; whoever he be that preacheth
Chriſt truly, heare him gladly, and receive him reſpectfully for his
Maſters ſake.</p>
                  <p>3. Make a fruitfull uſe of the gifts of every true Teacher, get
ſomewhat by all, and then thou wilt not glory in ſome, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage
others; if thou didſt profit by them, God ſhould have glory
and every Miniſter due eſteeme. It is in truth the vanity of the
hearers minds, their fullneſſe that makes them ſlight Mannah, and
cry for Quailes, that they cannot affect a good Teacher if he be
not excellent; the deſpiſing of the Teacher, is commonly us'd
as a cloake of their owne unteachableneſſe and diſobedience,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:158483:12"/>
get an hungry ſoule after the word, and then every wholeſome
truth will be welcome to thee: Remember that <hi>every gift of
the Spirit is given to profit withall, and ſhould be received to
that end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Laſtly, Be well grounded in knowledge, and conſtant in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of what thou haſt learned: <hi>Have thy ſenſes exerciſed in the
word of righteouſneſſe, that thou mayeſt be able to diſcerne
both good and evill, Heb.</hi> 5. 14. and ſo thou ſhalt be
fitted to profit by every godly Preacher, and
inſlave thy ſelfe to none, <hi>nor glory in
man, but in the Lord.</hi>
