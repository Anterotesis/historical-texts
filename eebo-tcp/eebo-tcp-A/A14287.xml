            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST HONOVRABLE,</hi> and my Noblest Lord: I haue out of my liues experience, prepared a <hi>Watry workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp,</hi> which I thinke the Gods forbad the excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in former times to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; but I haue performed That, that hath begott a world of worke in Me (which some men say will either impayre my witt, or hazard

            <p>What blessing soeuer Inuention doth raise, your Lordshipp knowes is subiect to a hotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potch of speach; and vntill it bee performed, Enuy, Mallice, and all spightfull detraction fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; so is it with me. But (my good Lord) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <note n="a" place="margin">Custome is a great Lord of command.</note> Lordly custome wils that great Lordes should patronize inuention; I doe most humbly beseech your Lordshipp (on my behalfe) so to doe; you beeing (next vnto my deare Soueraigne and His) heire apparant to my heart; hauing intaild my dutifull seruices to the heirs male of your body; and for want of such issue, to the heirs male of my Lord of <hi>Mongo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery,</hi> for euer, without reuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: these affections, proceed not (my honourable Lord) from any sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster respect; these following consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be the cause: The remembrance of that worthy Prince your Father, and more worthy (if might be) your Grand-father, and great Grandsiers, from the battels of <note n="b" place="margin">In these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral battels, the Vaughans mine Ances<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors followed yours.</note> 
               <hi>Cressy, Poytiers, Egincourt,</hi> and <hi>Banbury,</hi> with many others before, and since.
<pb facs="tcp:19653:14"/>
Where the many seruices of <hi>mine</hi> to <hi>yours</hi> hath bene such as Tradition will tell your Lordshipp, and I tell you with all, tha aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant fauours we found, makes mee thinke my selfe bound to your Lordship in recognisance of duty, and you tyed (by honourable and parrall couenants from them, to protect me and all my indeuors, laboring for the good of the common-wealth, and your glory. Now, if I make it not appeare a most flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing common-wealth; and such as neuer poore Subiect in the Kingdome did raise, put me by with your hand, as vnworthy of any fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble respect.</p>
            <p>Your Lordshipp shall finde no <hi>Monopole</hi> required; but, this I require at your handes: In matters of common-wealth, <hi>Expedition</hi> is alwayes of the <hi>Quorum</hi>; It is one of the chiefest friends (my Lord) the Suter (except he be a wrangler) hath in all the Kings courts: therefore I can require no lesse then that your Lordship command I may haue conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent accesse, without restraynt to performe my common-wealthes desires, with these li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations and due obseruance, that I dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turbe not your Lordships quiet, nor confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, with honourable persons, &amp; others of accompt: watching, &amp; taking the aduantage-of Time, and Place; a word at one time, and
<pb facs="tcp:19653:15"/>
two at another. Thinke not (most Noble Lord) that I am eyther insolently saucy, or too bold. Your Lordshi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pp shall here-after vnderstand the quality and condition of my vndertakings will admit little delay; I speake partly out of the complaint of an old seruant of your Grandfather <hi>Pembrookes,</hi> my Vncle <hi>Thomas Vaughan:</hi> who was to take his tryall for his life at Kings-bench-Barre at tenne of the clocke in the morning, hauing forgotten my Lords remembrance to some good friend, prayed passe of the Groome of his chamber being <hi>French:</hi> who with hard wordes stopped his passage; but he putting one of his Armes betwixt the <hi>French-mans</hi> twist, the other about his necke, threw him at my Lordes feete, and told his Lordshipp the cause was, he came for his life: My Lord hearing that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this his comming with a vengeance, in respect of his necessity to preuent a mischief, and with patience priuiledg'd the offence, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Groome for his ill respect: So good my Lord, make me free of your presence; and command your principall Attendants (as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries, but especially the Gentlemen of your Chamber, and Groomes) to take speciall notice, My comming is to doe you all honour. If I should attend Houres, Times and Seasons, I should bee in that case as if
<pb facs="tcp:19653:15"/>
I weare to deale with your Lordship by Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; to purchase your speach with a price, so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> memory of three hundred yeares dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy should be trodde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder foot as of no value.</p>
            <p>As Lawyers not fedde euery Tearme, breeds neglect of their Clients, with discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuances and cessations; so, your Lordshipp may handle the matter, and post me ouer by discontinuance, that you will forgett I haue not done my duty this two yeares and more. But your greatest and dearest Seruants can witnesse my appearance: Though happily not furnished with such glittering Garments as might light my way to you: for, Scarlet of Bilth (VVelch frizes other name) hath now little grace amongst great ones: But the Hood makes not the Fryar, not a braue Coate a braue man.</p>
            <p>Now be it knowne to your Lordship, and to all men (with the helpe of my Lord God, the Kings most excellent Maiesty, and you my deare Lord:) I purpose to raise a golden world (for common-wealth) in the <hi>Golden-Vale</hi> in Herefordshire (being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pride of al that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) bordering on <hi>Wales,</hi> ioyning to <hi>Ewias La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> (from whence your Lordshipp is descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) being the richest: yet (for want of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment) the plentifullest place <note n="a" place="margin">The richest Countrey breeds the idlest (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest) people.</note> of poore in the Kingdome, yeelding two or
<pb facs="tcp:19653:16"/>
three-hundred-folde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the number so increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing (Idlenesse hauing gotten the vpper hand;) if Trades bee not raised; beggery will carry such reputation in my quarter of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as if it had the whole to halues. Therefore (my honorable Lord) put not onely your hands, but all your will and all your strength hereto, praying my Lord of <hi>Moungomery</hi> to assist your Lordship (if there bee cause.) Let it be <hi>Vaughans</hi> supplication of <hi>Beggers</hi> vnto his Royall Maiestie, that they may haue meanes to worke, and so to liue.</p>
            <p>There bee within a mile and a halfe from my house euery way, fiue hundred poore habitations; whose greatest meanes consist in spinning Flaxe, Hempe, and Hurdes. They dispose the seasons of the yeare in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: I will begin with May,<note place="margin">How the poore of the country dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the seasons of the yeare.</note> Iune, and Iuly, (three of the merriest moneths for beggars) which yeeld the best increase for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to raise multitudes: Whey, Curdes, Butter-milke, and such belly-prouision, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in the neighbourhood, serues their turne. As <hi>Wountes</hi> or <hi>Moles,</hi> hunt after wormes, the ground being delue-able: so, these Idelers liue intollerablie by other meanes, and neglect their painfull labours by oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the neighbourhood. August, Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and October, with that permision which
<pb facs="tcp:19653:16"/>
the Lord hath allowed the poorer sort to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Eares of corne, they do much harme. I haue seene three hundred Leazers or Glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in one Gentlemans corne-field at once; his seruants gathering &amp; stouking the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheaues, the sheaues lying on the ground like dead carcases in an ouer-throwne battell, they following the spoyle not like souldiers (which scorne to rifle) but like theeues desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to steale; so this army holdes pillaging Wheate, Rye, Barly, Pease, and Oates: Oates, a graine which neuer grew in <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and altogether out of the allowance of Leazing.</p>
            <p>Vnder coulour of the last graine, Oates, it being the latest haruest, they doe (with-out mercy in hotte bloud steale,<note place="margin">The Beggers good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry of my countrey.</note> robbe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, Gardens, Hop-yards and Crab-trees: so what with leazing and stealing, they doe poorely maintaine them-selues Nouember, December, and almost all Ianuary, with some healps from the neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>Thus your Lordship sees (before God and the world) the principall meanes of their maintenance. The last three moneths, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, March, and Aprill, little labour serues their turne: they hope by the heate of the Sunne, (seasoning them-selues like <hi>Snakes</hi> vnder headges) to recouer the month
<pb facs="tcp:19653:17"/>
of May with much pouerty, long-fasting, and little-praying: and so make an end of their yeares trauell in the Easter holy-dayes.</p>
            <p>There is not one amongst ten that hath fiue shillings to buy a Bale of Flaxe, but forc'd to borrow money to put vp their trade, and runne to Hereford (loosing a dayes worke) to fetche the same: This done, they bee driuen to buy halfe a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shell of corne three or foure miles off, and in their returne attend the grinding of it; which if a better Customer come, they are sure to be serued last. Withall, they spend one day with the Weauer, and after it is woue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can sell, they make many iourneyes to markets, and honest mens houses: And thus many dayes are mispent in most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable maner.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The meanes to amend the Countries misery.</note>Now (my Honourable Lord) to helpe all these miseries; I haue, out of a yeares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, put a foote a Remedy which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well bee done, vnlesse your Lordship doe promise to countenance my discouery; if you do, Ile make your glory shine as farre aboue all other Subiects, as my <hi>Plot</hi> is hatefull to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enuious persons.</p>

There came vnto mee, a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen yeares since, a yong Minister, hauing a good witte, a good memory, and a pritty
<pb facs="tcp:19653:19"/>
dribble of learning: who made him-selfe fitte to teach children. Hee was intertained like a Leuite; and had the liberty of a Leuite; but with-in short time hee became a counterfeit Puritane. Vnder coulour whereof he ingros'd halfe the good opinions of the Parish, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile them to his profit and aduantage, and though him-selfe were presisely giuen, yet hee did little harme: I know not that hee hath reconcil'd any to that quick-siluer-brain'd pure faction (as good happ is.) I had euer a good hope, that hee would-subscribe, and obey the <hi>Cannons</hi> and <hi>Institutions</hi> of our Church, as hee did.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Benefice</hi> being voyde neere vnto mee (in her late Maiesties gift) an honorable <hi>kinsman</hi> of mine, gaue mee the <hi>presentation</hi> for this <hi>counterfeit.</hi> Hee had <hi>Institution</hi> and <hi>Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> according to the common course: but (my honorable Lord) as euery licquor serues not to coullor all coulors: so, euery soyle fitts not euery person. Hee had no sooner receiued the benefit of this <hi>Benifice,</hi> but the principall of his parishoners told mee I had planted a <hi>Machiuel</hi> amongst them; a cunning Pollitician, and an horrible vsurer,<note place="margin">Three speciall vertues to withstand the Flesh, the world and the Deuill.</note> making complaint to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> therof. But (my good Lord) because he had bin my seruant, I praide the <hi>Bishop</hi> with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to heare his defence, and for that time
<pb facs="tcp:19653:20"/>
preuented the likely-hood of his disgrace. Where-vpon I wrought with him to depart with that <hi>thing,</hi> and had agreed for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue, with a purpose (as the <hi>Bishop</hi> doth know) to plant a famous <hi>Preacher</hi> there, and told him all my intendiments: and to that end I most humbly praide the <hi>Bishop</hi> that it would please his Lordship, to giue liberty to one of his Chaplins, a learned and vertuous man, (Maister <hi>Best</hi>) to bee the man. That one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his, not able to maintaine a preaching Minister, there was one other ioyning there-vnto, which wee purpose to vnite: Hauing gotten the consent of the Lord Bishop, with promise of his best indeuour. But (my honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord) here comes in the hindrer of the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of soules, this counterfeit Puritane, this Machiuillian, this politician, &amp; Vsurer, by the gift of a friendlye <hi>Patron,</hi> hath as yet gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the vniting of these Churches; and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apointed vs of our Preaching-<hi>Minister,</hi> (as I learnt) by plaine symonie; and some treachery (withall) to his old Maister.<note place="margin">Policy, in wordly busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes more then Piety.</note> There were not two Sermons in the <hi>Golden-Vale</hi> this 500. yeares, vnlesse some Circumselion came by chance, vntill my Lord his Grace, that now is, of Canterburie his comming to that See. Now, whether we deserue to haue a Preaching Minister or no, we appeale to the VVorld.
<pb facs="tcp:19653:20"/>
There was an old <hi>Monke</hi> vppon the dissolution of the Abbey of <hi>Doier,</hi> that was cast from thence, came vnto the place where this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster serues: Hee did expound without licence, deuide and seuer the corps of the word, from the Spirit; so spoyling the Scripture with idle inuentions, that at his end he left neither <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, Puritane</hi> nor <hi>Papist</hi>; but a few of the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler sort, more inclined to <hi>Masse</hi> then to sound Religion. And of late, the late Canons do straightly appoint foure <hi>Sermons,</hi> yearly. In this manner (My Lord) this <hi>Machiuilian, Polititian,</hi> and <hi>Vserer</hi> hauing gotten two <hi>Beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> thinks it sufficient with his eight-quarter <hi>Sermons</hi> in his two Churches, to cleare the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which the old <hi>Monke</hi> bred: Hee not cunning ynough to dresse and cure the crazed of his flocke, hath onely iudgement with his Hooke to catch and hold a sheepe; which by ouer-hard handling hee doth so bruize, that now they can by no meanes indure that all-catching-fast-holding Instrument.</p>
            <p>And of late hath lent a young Preacher (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his prime practise) ten pound in money to make eight <note n="a" place="margin">A most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy-holy kind of Vsury.</note> quarter-sermons yearly: which <hi>Preacher</hi> venters his life sixteene-times ouer the great Riuer of <hi>Wye,</hi> and as many more vpp and downe a huge hill lying in his way; the danger of the least of which is able so to

distract a good Schollers memory, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gette a Sermon well pend, and no worse cond. I haue wondred many times of the young <hi>Preacher,</hi> who did but learne to preach the other day, how hee was furnished with one in the fore-noone, and another in the after: Heerein shall I vse your Lordshipps meanes, that wee may haue this Vserer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued. It must bee done; and I thinke this to be the best meanes: Your Lordshipp may commend him to some strange Ambassadour out of <hi>Asia</hi> or <hi>Africke</hi>; not in <hi>Europe,</hi> hee will learne the Language instantly: Hee is fit for any strange Religion. Hee will serue for an Intelligencer to execute any cunning Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem belonging to matters of State. When your Lordshipp hath vnderstood the trunesse of all my inuention (which happily you will runne ouer withall expedition, like an old Priest <note n="a" place="margin">Swift rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</note> reading an <hi>Homily</hi> to taske, (which I wish not.)

Its a better course (tenne to one) then to take money to vsury; knowing what I know: and I know as much (perhaps) that way as any poore Gentleman in <hi>VVales</hi> (without vaine glory bee it spoken.) First (my Lord) hee that will take money vppon vsury, must deale with the Scriuener in Dialogue man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; thus for example: Sir, haue you any money?

            <p>It is yet wondered at, by almost <hi>all,</hi> how a particular and priuate Gentleman should bee able to bring all this to passe.</p>

which within sixe months I obteined. After it pleased GOD to giue mee recouery, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued for the <hi>Lowe-countrey-warres</hi> againe: and hauing begun my iourney thetherward, I happened on a <hi>Country-Gentlewoman,</hi> who was seized of a <hi>Mannor,</hi> and ouer-shot <hi>Mill</hi>: which conuerted all my <hi>martiall endeuours</hi> and hopes of <hi>honor,</hi> to these country-labours: Hauing soiourn'd two yeares in my Fathers house, wearied in doing nothing, and fearing my <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi> had beene ouer-throwne in putting by my Martiall <hi>occupation</hi>; I began to expostulate with my selfe what was best to be done to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue my reputation with my martiall <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi> and with-all to giue contentment to my vertuous and louing wife.

               <p>After hee had prepared it ready for the foundation, hee planted some thousand stakes in the bottom of the <hi>Brooke</hi> to carry the maine Syll.

               <p>Hee grew teasty, hott, and peremptory; and sayd it was not the Maisters manner to controule; but, to examine: and that all his <hi>VVater-workes</hi> were according to the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an foundation,</hi> built altogether vppon <hi>Piles:</hi> but the <hi>Venetian-fashion</hi> forced mee to want water ten yeares space, which was out of my way two thousand poundes.</p>
               <p>The reason was this; the water vndermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Syll,</hi> it forced the <hi>Earth</hi> beyond the <hi>postes,</hi> which were placed in the firme <hi>ground</hi>; and hauing gotten the vpper hand of the <hi>main-Land</hi> it could not bee holp vntill the <hi>Sylle</hi> were rais'd againe.

               <p>I desir'd but his oth for my satisfaction; hee badde mee haue patience, it was not his fashion to forsweare him-selfe.

               <p>There is another Gentleman, who dwells on my left hand, makes shew of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it; yet are his <hi>grounds</hi> ouer-howed with the like neglect: but seeming to excuse it by some vnexpected troubles (which indeed hee indured) &amp; that his weighty occasions would not giue him leaue to vnder-take, nor suffer his seruants to attend it, hee hauing in the eye of his <hi>house,</hi> a hundred <hi>Acres</hi> of errable land, worth not aboue three shillings an <hi>Acre,</hi> which amounts but to fifteene pound a yeare. Yet I made him this offer, if he would bee pleased to make it plaine, as plaine might bee, for foure yeares, I would giue him fifteene pound a yeare, beeing the true valew of his land: and after the end of the foure yeares, I would take it for one and twenty, yeelding him a hundred pounds a yeare, the charge wholy mine, in raising <hi>sluces; stankes, trenches,</hi> and what else so-euer:<note place="margin">A liberall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer refused, which if take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, had benefited the offerer more then the offered.</note> so, during the foure yeares, hee should receiue fifteene pound a yeare; and euer after, a hundred pound yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him and his heires for euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19653:57"/>I did not require any thing vntill the foure yeares were expired, and then my demaund was but three hundred pound.</p>

               <p>He offered me nothing, and hee hath done nothing; so this is but an accusation for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, setting it forth in as friendly manner as I may. O! if the Lord of a Mannor did but know what an offence it is to plant an <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-shot-mil</hi> vpon a Riuer, where the scituation of the soile affords drownings: He were better to put his wits aworke to make <hi>VVindmils</hi> in plain <hi>ground,</hi> if hee would consider what hee looseth by it.</p>
               <p>For example; my right-hand-neighbour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing such a <hi>Mill</hi> as I speake off, worth some tenne pound by yeare, and four hundred <hi>Acres</hi> of excellent <hi>ground</hi> to handle: hee forbeares his <hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>Sommer</hi> drowning, to giue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to this vnsatisfiable glutton the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-shot-mil,</hi> where, in the trunesse of husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, hee should dayly drowne three hundred <hi>Acres</hi> for euer.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Sun</hi> shines euer once a day in <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> by reason whereof the Land yeelds sweete increase; so might he say he dwelt daily

in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which euer flowes with Milke and Hony.</p>

in not placing a Planke of foure inches thicke, and twenty inches broad, vnder the maine <hi>Syll,</hi> to preuent the water from vndermining the same, and withall fayling to lay my <hi>Groundes</hi> (by the indiscretion of my Seruants) leuell or plaine, and not vnderstanding of what strength my Stanks should be to with stand the weight of the VVater that playes against them, &amp; what alowance to giue each Stanke in his Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and forbearing the running of my <hi>Trench-Royal</hi> to the end of his <hi>Course</hi> for many yeares, and not thinking Stankes to bee necessary for the commaunding of <hi>Grounds</hi> disoebeying my desire, and withall (lately) running <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Trenches,</hi> which next the <hi>Trench-royall,</hi> haue place aboue any; which were not drempt off before; many <hi>sluces,</hi> and for many yeares, were forborne in places most conuenient, and much profit lost thereby:<note place="margin">Twenty yeares practise in these VVorkes.</note> my speculation hauing continuance in practise aboue twenty yeares.</p>
               <p>But were it now to beginne againe, I would performe it in one: and raise it to the greatest profit in foure: so hard a thing is it for any mortall man to perfitt any profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table inuention, without paines, cost, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time.</p>
               <p>They say now, if Maister <hi>Vaughan</hi> had these &amp; these <hi>grounds</hi> he would doe This and This.
<pb facs="tcp:19653:61"/>
This opinion haue I gotten in the <hi>countrey</hi> where I dwell.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Shropshire</hi> Gentleman (Maister <hi>Hoord</hi>) a famous man, his <hi>labours</hi> (I know) haue taken tryall at <hi>Enuies</hi> Barre, by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Iurors</hi> and vniust <hi>Iudges</hi> for a <hi>worke</hi> hee performed. It was chargeable vnto him; the situation thereof was such as it could not be otherwise handled. I saw it, viewed it, and examined it; and I know it doth much more then counteruaile the charge. But had I beene acquainted with him, in his first beginning, he should not haue spent his time to so small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: not that he mistooke in the handling ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but knowing my owne errors, and by cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience able to instruct him; I found no want of Arte in him, but the want of <hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>Summer-water</hi> to serue his turne.</p>
               <p>I would haue perswaded him to haue forborn that barren <hi>vnder-taking,</hi> &amp; to haue gotten fiue or sixe thousand pound with ten times lesse labour, in the choise of a thousand places else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, where hee might haue drowned dayly for euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muddy-flouds</hi> doe often happen in <hi>Summer-time.</hi> If the running of them idle bee so vnto other men as it is vnto mee,<note place="margin">Muddy flouds often happen in Summer-time.</note> let them doe as I doe; euer haue one pasture bare eaten: and as
<pb facs="tcp:19653:62"/>
you keepe one speciall Chamber in your house to entertaine a <hi>stranger,</hi> so, you alwayes haue one Pasture for that <hi>muddy-floud,</hi> which will pay you after twise twenty in the hundred. It's confessed by all in the <hi>Golden-Vale,</hi> that that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle land which wee haue would be bettred fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred pounds a yeare. If the like were done through-out England,<note place="margin">Note the profit of drownings.</note> it would profit the kingdome in a yeare two Millions: which would maintaine an <hi>army-royall,</hi> to the honour of <hi>Great Brittaine,</hi> and be most comfortable to all honourable <hi>Souldiers,</hi> Crest-falne for want of warre and military imployment.</p>
               <p>It pleased maister <hi>Hoord</hi> to view the place where my <hi>Water-workes</hi> were performed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with three iuditious and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentlemen, namely, Maister <hi>Brainton,</hi> Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Pearle,</hi> and Maister <hi>Wolridge</hi>; what their beleefe was, I referre it to those who haue a desire to be informed.</p>
               <p>Any Gentleman or other hauing performed a <hi>worke,</hi> and brought it to his absolute perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; should not sit downe by it: but hauing fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished that <hi>Worke,</hi> and being Maister but of one <hi>Liuing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note this aduice.</note> I would (as I formerly said) aduise him to sell it: and at the end of foure yeares make good account by purchase, to gaine sixe, if not ten for one. I haue a Meade called <hi>nine dayes-math:</hi> an exellent Meade, and approued for such of all my neighbours. I sold the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage
<pb facs="tcp:19653:62"/>
thereof diuerse yeares for fiue pound <hi>per Annum</hi>: but within few yeares, after the flouds plaid vpon it, I solde the Hey for ten pound yearely: and the latter or <hi>after-math</hi> was richly worth fiue. I will graze this Meade vntill <hi>May</hi>: yet notwithstanding the Hey will yeeld me ten pound, and the <hi>after-math</hi> fiue. Now hauing (I hope) profited the intelligent Reader, thus far: al the fauour I desire at his hands, in lue therof, is this, That I may haue leaue to giue new names vnto mine old <hi>grounds,</hi> without beeing laught at in <hi>ordinaries</hi> by scarce ordinary vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers. Some they must haue; for, those they had by drowning are couered with new earth. And with-all, they bee inlarged aboue two hundred <hi>Acres.</hi> I cannot call that the <hi>nine-daies-math,</hi> which now is aboue 30.

<pb facs="tcp:19653:63"/>
I say nothing to it: but, beleeue those dairy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that affirme it. This I can say, for any that desire often change, (as the most part would haue fresh and fresh pasture) if they (being cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious) will not bee coy to handle a Cow-shore in his kinde: then thus; When the Kine bee put ouer to some other <hi>ground,</hi> you know their staine or dung by heate of the sunne will grow hard: and within short time, will force a proud and insolent grasse; such as the Kine in their returne will not touch.</p>
               <p>When you turne out your Kine into fresh <hi>feeding</hi>; bee sure to disperce and seuer those Cow-shares, that the place be, not stained with any polution. They being dispersed; drowne your <hi>ground</hi> with cleare water: or mudd (if a <hi>floud</hi> happen) the ground being bare, two Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings incounter each other, and purifie the place where the <hi>Cow-shores</hi> were falne: so, at the next turning in of your Kine, some fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night after, they shall finde nothing to distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or offend the taste: the water doth cleanse and cleare all annoyance to the beast, and breeds perfect life in euery growing grasse. This last <hi>Summer</hi> 1604. in Trinity terme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboue at London, I came not downe till after <hi>Mid-Summer:</hi> hauing grazed my mowing Meades too too long after <hi>May.</hi> Vpon my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, I enquired in what state my grounds stood,
<pb facs="tcp:19653:63"/>
my seruants answered they were sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye seasoned;<note place="margin">Eye-pleasers are often liers.</note> but (in deed) they did (as many) seruants doe) report the best of the worst, to excuse their negligence: the Meades were not so sufficiently drownd, as the necessitie thereof required: They being neglected before mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not trying their temper with a <hi>riding-rod,</hi> (my beliefe was so great in those greater <hi>Liers</hi>) but after mowing, the truth appeared, the quantity of <hi>Meade</hi> (in one place) being three score and ten <hi>Acres,</hi> by reason of the mowing, making, and cariage, before the ground were free to drowne, the extremitie of the heate was so great, that the grasse turned yellow; being tainted, as a <hi>sheepe</hi> on a drye <hi>rotte:</hi> or, as a man inlye sick, and newly recouered faules into <hi>a relaps</hi> againe.</p>
               <p>In this manner my <hi>grounds</hi> had gotten the <hi>greene-sicknesse</hi> or <hi>a buruing-feauer</hi> (I know not well whether) If in the extreame heate you would drowne with Iudgement, you should not drowne in the heate of the day: but in the night from <hi>sunne</hi> to <hi>sunne.</hi> But being forc'd, I suffered the water to worke night and day; the season of the yeare falling out to bee dry: the sunne extreamly hotte; the ground hott, dry, and hard: so what betweene the heate of the sunne, and heate of the ground, the water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came luke-warme, and faild to effect that good
<pb facs="tcp:19653:64"/>
which by Nature other-wise it would haue done.</p>
               <p>And if I be not deceiued, the infection of the <hi>earth,</hi> had poysoned the <hi>water</hi>: or made it so sick, as it was not able to endure the <hi>ground.</hi> As a scudding shewer of raine,<note place="margin">The quality of ground distempered with heate.</note> doth raise vpon a <hi>dung-hill-poole</hi> great bubbles (like an Oxe-eye) by falling of the drops thereon; or, as water in a pott, by the heate of the fire, doth labour, and shew distemper: so, did that water-worke, play, and bubble on the face of the <hi>ground,</hi> shewing (for a quarter of an houre) nothing but discontent.</p>
               <p>The ground being qualified, the grasse did not instantly grow (as at other times, being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly fedd) the coullour being changed, the grasse standing at the point of death, being in that case as a sicke pacient hauing taken a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, who must haue a time of recouery: so did the <hi>grasse,</hi> for diuerse dayes, shew nothing but sorrow, heauinesse and all discomfort.

               <p>VVhen they bee eight weekes old take away the Milke of one Teat from your Calfe in milking your Cow before the Calfe bee suffered to sucke: the want of which Teate (for hunger and thirst) will prouoke both your Calfe to eate Hay, and drinke VVater. Continue him so for foure dayes; then take away, or milke one other Teate from your Calfe as aforesaid, which is halfe the Milke; so, will you force your Calfe to a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Hay and VVater: After this, take away the milk of another Teate within foure daies after; and so after that take away all.

               <p>VVhen they haue beene some month in your best <hi>Meads</hi> in <hi>Mid-may,</hi> and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered their strength: put them into some higher <hi>Groundes</hi> where there is <hi>Grasse, water,</hi> and shadow ynough: Lett them rest there vntill <hi>Bartholomew</hi>: then put them ouer into your <hi>After-maths</hi> before the time of the yeare growes cold, and then it wil so puffe them with pride y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al the <hi>winter</hi> following they wil scorn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>The first yeare beeing spent, euery man knowes how to handle them: If you will haue them principall cattell, giue them hay ynough the second <hi>Winter.</hi>
