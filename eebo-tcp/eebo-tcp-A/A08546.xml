            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE famous Philosopher Aristotle
being demaunded what benefit he
hadde obtained by the studie and
practise of Philosophie, answered,
This, that vncommanded I can doe
that I ought, and auoide the doing
of that I should not. For (saith he)
the ignorant and ruder sort abstain
from euill, compelled, for feare of
punishment: but the wise and learned doe shun the same,
of their owne accord, because it is euill. A worthie saying,
and well beseeming the excellencie of so noble a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.
For what is there that can more effectually expresse
the benefit that ariseth by the studie of any thing, then to
shew the effects that it worketh in them that applie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
therevnto? And what effect is there equall vnto this
when a man vncommaunded, can conforme his iudgement,
frame his will, and order his actions, according to the rule of
reason, and auoide whatsoeuer is contrarie to the same? And
as the studie of Philosophie worketh this in the followers
thereof: so doth the studie of other laudable things also,
bring foorth verie commendable effectes, eche one in their
owne kinde. For which cause sundrie men in times past haue
penned with great labour, the laudable workes of antiquitie,
and some also in these our daies, imitating the painefull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of those auncient writers, haue with no lesse trauaile
written Histories of later yeeres, which by the reading of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
might be aswell profitable to repell other vaine delights, as
pleasant to passe away the tediousnesse of the time. Among
which, I haue caused this [Third part of the first booke

done, I aduised with my selfe where I might finde out

of your vertuous and euerie way Gentlemanlike dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

And the great charge which the Princesse had giuen vnto
her, as well in the discouering of the great loue that she bore
vnto the knight of the Sunne, as also to haue a great care
of all things that should passe with the Princesse <hi>Lindabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
in that iourney, that afterward she should thereof giue
certaine and iust relation.</p>
               <p>The Historie doth now saie, that <hi>Arcania</hi> did neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
nor was absent out of the companie and conuersation of
the knight of the Sunne, so that she did see and vnderstand
all that did passe, and how that the marriage was concluded
in such sort, that there was no remedie. Her sorrowe was
great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> caused in her much heauinesse, to thinke of the great
<pb facs="tcp:13995:6"/>
griefe that her Ladie should receiue when she should vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the newes thereof, &amp; it séemed that her estate woulde
litle profit to pacifie her, hearing that the knight of the Sun
is married to the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides.</hi> This damsell <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cania</hi>
determined that night to depart towardes her owne
Countrie, and thinking that she should doe well first to giue
the knight of the Sunne to vnderstand of her departure. At
such time as he was in his bed with great light in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
she entered in, and finding him all alone, she said: God
blesse the good knight of the Sunne. He answered: Thou
art welcome my good friend <hi>Arcania,</hi> what makest thou heere
at this time of the night? I come (said she) to take my leaue
of you, for that I meane to returne vnto the Princesse <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiana</hi>
my Ladie and mistres, for whereas she is forgotten
and no memorie of her seruice, I know not what reward I
shall looke for of my part. How is this, said the knight of the
Sun? Hast thou no hope that I will gratifie thée for all thy
good seruice? Doest thou not know, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> if I should forget my
selfe, there is the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> my Ladie, who wil
reward thée in ample maner. Hope I haue none at al in you,
sayd <hi>Arcania,</hi> for he that hath falsified his faith made vnto
the most highest &amp; precious damsell in all the world, he will
ill obserue and kéepe it with so base and poore a damsell as
I am. Of the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> I request no paiment
at her hands, for being a damsel of the Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi>
I thinke it a great reproch to receiue reward of anie other.
Oh knight of the Sun, how may the fame of thy great déeds
from this day forwards cease, &amp; the praise of thy high knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
with the continuall report of thy great vertue: &amp; increase
the newes of thy disloialtie, when the falsifieng of thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

how the roiall. Princesse <hi>Claridiana</hi> onely for your loue,
left her owne Countrie of <hi>Trapisonda,</hi> &amp; came into <hi>Grecia,</hi> at
such time as you did offer your selfe to be her knigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

accepted you as her owne, discouering vnto you the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
of her beautie, wherby you did vnderstand that you
were by her beloued, &amp; thought at that time that there was
not borne in all the world one so happie as you were. How
is it now that there remaineth in you so little force, and so
great villanie, that the presence of the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi>
can worke more in effect than the memorie of the Princesse
<hi>Claridiana.</hi> Doe not you remember, how that in the Court
of the Emperour <hi>

                     </gap>rebatio,</hi> they were both present together,
whereas they did manifest their great beauties, being with
rich ornaments adorned, who was then of you most estéemed
and best beloued? Call to remembrance the good wil which
you had at your departure out of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and ioyne it to that
which you haue at this present, then shall you sée and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
how all things is changed cleane contrarie, not for
anie other thing, but that you doe more estéeme the things
present, although they be small, than those which are to
come, though they be more higher and of greater valour, the
which procéedeth of base thoughts and conditions. Oh how
fraile and miserable is humane nature, that whereas is so
much force and strength for to ouercome and conquere so
many knights and gyants, doth lacke heart and strength to
make resistance against one thought and appetite. If that
you vpon the sheeld of memorie of my Ladie and mistres,
did receiue the blowes of the presence of the Princesse <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabrides,</hi>
neither could the blowes be so strong, nor the shéeld
so weake, but that with great ease you might remayne
with the victorie. But as you haue forgot your faith and
promise, so haue you forgot the remembrance of her greate
beautie and high valour, and verie easilie you were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with the presence of the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> I doe
therefore meane to returne vnto the Princesse my Ladie
and mistres, and make manifest your great disloialtie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord bée with you. When that <hi>Arcania</hi> had conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
these wordes, without tarrying ani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> answere, she depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of the chamber, and went downe the staires, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
she had lefte her Palfraie in a readinesse, and taking
<pb facs="tcp:13995:7"/>
his backe, she departed out of the Citie, and tooke her iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
towards <hi>Trapisonda.</hi> The knight of the Sunne recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
great griefe and sorrow for that the damsell would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
and rose out of his bed, and went after her, but séeing
that she was gone, hée made little account of her, for that
the loue of the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> had so inueigled him,
that although he did well vnderstand her wordes, yet they
did worke no more effect in him, than in one that had béene
cleere of all cares and passions, till such time as he was laid
againe in his bed, whereas it did not let somew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his profound imaginations, to remember what <hi>Arcania</hi> had
said of the Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> and of his faith and worde
giuen her to be her knight: which was the occasion that ther
grew in his thought a verie great alteration, and troubled
verie much his mind, in such sort, that it disturbed him from
sléepe or taking anie rest, but tumbling and tossing from one
side of the bed vnto the other, which did increase in him by
little and little the remembrance of the Princesse <hi>Claridia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi>
So after a while, being somewhat in quiet by reason of
the great disquietnesse that he had suffered, his minde recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
some ease, and being in a slumber neither sléeping nor
waking, hauing all his senses occupied with the Princesse,
it seemed that she appeared before him with so great maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
and beautie, that it dazeled the sight of his eies, equall
vnto the shining of the Sunne when he appeareth out of the
Orient, her bodie al armed, sauing her head &amp; face was who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
discouered with her yeolow golden haire, which was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parsed
behinde her eares, and hung downe vnto the grounde
like thréeds of golde, she had her swoord naked in her hand;
and with an irefull semblaunce, lifting vp her arme for to
strike him, she said.</p>
               <p>Oh false and traiterous Knight, thou art now at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie
and point to receiue the guerdon for thy great disloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie.
Then the knight of the Sun who did behold her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
himselfe with her strange beautie, accompanied
with her great maiestie, was straight waies ouercome with
the force therof, so that the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13995:7"/>
séemed to be verie foule, &amp; caused the sparkes of loue
new to kindle within him, which before were put out by the
long absence from her, and began so much to repent himselfe
of that which was past, that he fel prostrate vpon the ground
before the Princesse, crauing pardon at her hands, but shee
vnto his séeming came verie irefull, making no account of
that which he had said, but alwaies séemed for to strike him
with the sword she had in her hand: who being meruailously
amazed thereat, did sodainlie awake out of that imagination
or dreame, with so great shaking &amp; quaking, that all the bed
shooke therewith. So when he was come wholie vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and considered well of al that had passed, the presence of
the Princesse remained so graued in his heart &amp; minde, that
it séemed vnto him that she was so naturallie before him in
presence, as when he last sawe her in the Citie of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
and the old wound wherewith he was wounded at the
first sight of her, did now worke so much effect in him, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the
remembrance of the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> was cleane for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
&amp; the loue of the Princes <hi>Claridiana</hi> so grassed in his
hart, that by no meanes he could take anie quietnesse or rest
within his bed, but calling to remembrance all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> was past, &amp;
the marriage that was ordeined for the next day following,
he fell into a great perplexitie, &amp; abhorred himselfe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> hee arose vp from his
bed, and put on his apparell, &amp; looked about for his armour,
which he found hanging in a corner of his chamber, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he armed himselfe in all assaies, &amp; tooke the light Torch
that was in his chamber burning, &amp; descended into the great
Pallace, and so into the Court, and comming vnto the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he found that the horsekéepers were a sleepe, and waking
one of them in great secret, he commanded him in great hast
for to saddle his horse. The horsekéeper when he knew him
was greatlie amazed, and said: My Lord, whether is it your
pleasure to goe in this sort, and at this time of the night? I
goe (sayd the knight of the Sun) after a damsell that is gone
awaie from me, therefore hold thy peace and be quiet, for
I will returne againe by and by. This young man without
<pb facs="tcp:13995:8"/>
anie farther replying, did saddle his horse with a trice, &amp; lead
him out at a poster<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

leàpt with great lightnesse, and so departed out of the great
Citie, &amp; tooke an vnknowen waie by a valley, for that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
should follow him, they should not finde him. So he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
so long by that valley, that it brought him vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rockes and hilles which was at the foote of the mightie
mountaine called <hi>Taurus,</hi> which is one of the largest in all
the world, and entered into the said mountaine at such time
as the Sun appeared, and for that he found himselfe wearie
with the great trauaile that night, he determined there for
to rest himselfe, supposing that no man would come to séeke
him in that place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherewith he alighted, and pulled off his
horse bridle, and committed him vnto the gréene field to féede
at pleasure. Then did he laie himselfe down vpon the greene
hearbes, the which were so delightfull, that it yéelded occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

highnesse &amp; beautie of the Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

mine owne hands, for that I could not consider the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
that God did shew vnto me, the high throne wherevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
I was exalted, the great glorie that I did receiue when I
was accepted and receiued for knight vnto the royall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
what ioy might haue bene compared vnto mine? If I
had not bene foolish and out of my wits, I had bene equall
with those that doth continuallie recreate themselues in the

But alasse and woe, euen as so high a name cannot be
comprehended in so base a knight as I am, so in short time
I haue lost the preheminence, and am depriued of all. Oh
that my fortune were so happie, that the course of my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
life were come to conclusion, to make an end of this my
sorrowful torment, for that liuing I might not féele &amp; suffer
so great misfortune. In saying these &amp; many other wordes,

for she being a Pagan and I a Christian, it is the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull

that either she must returne to be a Christian, or else I must
forsake my profession, and become a Pagan. The other, for

<hi>Alicandro,</hi> for that they will not haue a Christian knight for

he set spurres vnto his horse, and like vnto the winde he
ranne vp a high and mightie hill. <hi>Oristedes</hi> when he sawe

sawe him follow all alone, he was verie glad and tarried for
him, who certified him how that his companions remained
behinde, and how that he would not leaue his companie, if
it were his pleasure to accept it. The knight of the Sunne
gaue him great thankes, gratifying his good will, at which

pleasure as she should thinke best, and how that they were
all at her commandement, in anie thing she would imploie
them. This good Emperour did not alonelie offer vnto her
knights of great renewin for to beare her companie into her
Countrie, but also did contend that himselfe in person would
do the like. This roiall Princesse surrendering great thanks
for the same, would not consent that the Emperor neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

towards the Empire of <hi>Trapisonda,</hi> and the Emperor with
all his knights returned againe vnto the Citie, whereas he
feit great griefe for the lack of his sons, &amp; of the good knights
that were absent for their respects from the court. Now doth
the Historie returne vnto the Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> &amp; saith,
that they found the wind so prosperous, that in a short time

great friends the knight of the Sunne, &amp; the
troian <hi>Oristedes,</hi> make their iourneies, ouer
the mightie féedes of the mounre <hi>Tauro,</hi>
which was verie fresh and delightfull, and
polished with manie Castells, and faire
houses, in which trauaile for the space of manie daies, they
did sundry feates of armes, by reason that the inhabitants
ther, were verie barbarous, so that euerie daie they were
driuen to armore and to make their defence. And in al places
wheresoeuer they became, they hadde contention with the
dwellers there aboutes, and although all that mountaine
was replenished with Castiles and houses, somwhat apart
the one from the other, yet did they passe the greatest part
thereof with little daunger, till vppon a night it happened
being verie darke, and they in the field where as they could
<pb facs="tcp:13995:14"/>
not discouer neither castle nor house, whether they might go
to lodge themselues, &amp; being in such a constillation, as was
very colde, so that the first part of the night they passed with
great trouble, till such time as from far of they discouered a
light of fier, which séemed to be in a great and déeps valley,
they thinking that it was made by some shepherds that kept
their shéepe there, being very glad, went thether wards. And
when they came nigh vnto the place, they saw that it was a
companie of more then thirtie barbarous people of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
being of a high and large stature, and either of them
had but one eye, and that was in their foreheads, as big as a
smal looking glasse. They were al apparailed with the skins
of beares, and of other beastes, sitting round about a great
fier which they had made, and some of them were rosting of
certaine Uenison, and of other beastes (which they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
vpon spits of wood. Their talke which they had was
verie barbarous and strange, so that these knights could not
vnderstand them, for it séemed to be a kinde of howling or
bleating: but when they came nigh vnto them, they were
greatly amazed to sée people so brutish, &amp; staied themselues,
not knowing what to say. These barbarous monsters whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they saw them vpon the Horse backes, and so richly armed,
straight waies one which semed to be the principal amongst
them, began to speake in their barbarous tongue, making
signes that they should alight, &amp; come vnto the fire to warme
them, and to take part of their supper, which was there a
dressing. So when the knights vnderstode their meanings,
the knight of the Sunne saide vnto <hi>Oristedes,</hi> my very good
friend what doe you thinke best that we doe: Then <hi>Oriste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
said, Sir it séemes vnto mée requisite to do that which
necessitie doth constraine vs, that is, that we alight &amp; go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fier, and suppe with this people, for that colde &amp; hung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
will not consent that we doe any other thing. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
if they demaund of vs paiment for the shotte, then is
there your fine cutting sworde which will pay for vs all.
Be it done as you haue saide, my very good friend <hi>Oristedes,</hi>
said the knight of the Sunne, for that your bountie, in what
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13995:14"/>
soeuer perill, doth put vs in suretie: but yet mée thinks it
not requisite to sléepe much among this people. And in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these words, these two worthie knights did alight, and
pulled the bridles from their Horses, and gaue them leaue
to féede on the gréene grasse, of which there was great store,
so they came vnto the fier and sat themselues downe by the
principall of them, with their beuers lifted vp. But when
these barbarous people did sée them so faire and of so gallant
disposition, they all had a great good will for to kill them &amp;
to eate them, for that they hadde rather féede vpon humaine
flesh when they may get it, then of any other beast. So that
in their bleating speach, they concluded amongst them for to
execute their pretence. And these knights for that they did
not vnderstand them, held their peace, warmeing themselues
by the fier, making hast by signes, that the supper were made
readie, for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

these company of barbarous people did set themselues vpon
the ground round about their vittailes, and began to teare
it in péeces with their handes, and to eate with lustie cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages.
The chiefe captaine of them, gaue vnto these knights
of the Uenison for their parts, who at that present made lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
account of the great abundance that they were wont to
haue, at the Emperour <hi>Alicandro</hi> his table, and at the feasts
of the Emprour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> but fell vnto their vittailes with
tooth and naile: Yet that supper had cost them very déere, if
that the soueraigne creator had not remembred them. For
that in the best and chiefest time of their supper, when most
contentment these perfect friends receiued, two of these bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Tartarians dissembling to serue the rest, arose vp
from their companie, and toke eche of them a mightie great

barbarous Tartarians arose vp alogether and came for to

not staying with that, but with great courage and furie, he
put himselfe amongst the thickest of them, wounding and
killing all that he might fasten blows vpon: but these Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,
recouering their clubbes, with loude cryings they
did assault him on euerie syd, charging him with mightie
and terrible blowes, but by reason that they were cleane
without armour, and this valiant and stoute knight, in the
heate of his furie, in short speace, by kiling of some, and
wounding of other some, the rest ranne awaie, for feare
of his mortal blowes: so that not one of all these barbarous
Tartarians did remaine in sight. This being concluded,
he was going towards his friend the Troyan <hi>Oristedes,</hi> for
to succour him, who at that insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was come vnto himselfe,
and with great courage and furie, he arose vp, thinking that
his enimies hadde bene there still: but loking about for
them and seing so manie slaine, and none in presence but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13995:15"/>
the knight of the Sunne, with great ioye and pleasure he
went vnto him, &amp; embracing him with great loue he saide:

not forgot you, but haue great and speciall care of your
great valour, the which is made maniefest vnto me, in the
preuenting of this present perill, otherwise this supper had
bene full dere vnto me. Then the knight of the Sunne
embracing of him saide. The liuing god, who knoweth
the secret of all things, would not consent that so worthie a
knight as you are, should be slaine by so great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And his pleasure was, for to deliuer mée by his bountifull
goodnesse, whereby I should make defence to saue vs both
from so great rebuke and shame. And now seeing that
here is none for to disturbe vs: Let vs sit downe and make
an ende of our supper, and take our rest here till to morow
morning. Let it be as you doe commaund, saide <hi>Oristedes,</hi>
séeing that here is none to trouble vs: therwith these two
good companions did sette them selues downe, and did eate
of the vittailes that was there, till they were satisfied.
But yet they durst not sléepe all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> night, fearing that those
Tartarians, which fled awaie would being some other of
their companions &amp; trouble them, so that they passed awaie
that night in walking rounde about the fire, discoursing
of that wherein they receued most content, alwaies haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

taken their ease without anie care, for that those which
were fled awaie were so scarred with the mightie great and
terrible blowes of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> knight of the Sunne, that they thought
it not for the best to retourne backe againe, and although
they were fled verie far, yet did not they thinke themselues
in anie securitie. So when the daie was come these two
knights did bridell their horses, and mounting vppon their
backes they departed from that place, &amp; after trauailed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
daies vppon the skirt of the mount <hi>Tauro,</hi> wherein

This and manie wordes more like in effect, did this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

for to come vnto her Ladie the Princes <hi>Claridiana,</hi> to
declare vnto her y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whole course of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> disloialtie of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> knight of
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Sunne, as one y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> was ignorant of all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> succeded afterward,

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13995:17"/>
                  <hi>Lindabrides.</hi> And so not happening vnto her anie thing in
her iourney that might disturbe her: in the end of certayne
daies after her departure from the <hi>gran Cataio,</hi> she ariued
at the Empire of <hi>Trapisonda,</hi> and she vnderstanding howe
that the Emperour was dead, and how that her Ladie was
crowned Empresse of <hi>Trapisonda,</hi> she directed her iourney
thetherwards, &amp; came thether at such time as the Empresse
was most desirous to heare newes of her knight, because his
tarying was so long, thinking euerie daie to bée one whole
yéere. So when that <hi>Arcania</hi> came into the Citie, she went
straight waies towards the roiall pallace, &amp; entered in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
at such time as the Empresse was all alone in her clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,
occupied with no other thing, but with her continual an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
and sorrowful thoughts, who being certefied of her so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarinesse,
made no more adoe but entered into her closet, &amp;
shut the doore after her, and comming before the Empresse,
fell downe vpon her knées, and craued her handes to kisse
them, with so great abundance of teares that distiled from
her eies, that she had not the power to speake one word. The
Empresse séeing her on such a sodaine to enter in, shée was
greatlie ameruailed, and went and embraced her, saying. Ah
<hi>Arcania,</hi> the true &amp; faithful secretarie of all my secrets, what
sodaine comming is this of thine, that maketh me so much
amazed and astonied. How is it that thou commest alone,
and lefte the companie of him that thou wentest withall,
where hast thou left my knight, tell me whether he bée come
into this Countrie or not, for that there is nothing in this
world that at this present can giue me more content or ioy
vnto my hart: tell me out of hand some newes of him, make
no tarrying, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> euerie moment séemeth to me one whole
yéere of thy delating. The sorrow and griefe the which <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cania</hi>
had (for those heauie newes that she should giue vnto
her Ladie) was such, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he could doe no other thing but
wéepe, and was not able to speake one word, the which being
well considered by the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> it brought her
into the greatest perpleritie and sorrow that euer shée was
in, in all her life, suspecting the euill newes that she brought,
<pb facs="tcp:13995:18"/>
for that she was so long in declaring them vnto her. And
hauing not the heart to suffer any longer, but shedding great
abundance of teares wherewith she did all to be bathe her
face, she burst out and said.</p>
               <p>Oh high, mightie, and immortall God, creator of all the

in telling vnto mée her newes: if they be anie that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
vnto my long hope &amp; desired pleasure, let me heare
them. But oh vaine hope of men, how can any of vs liue but
in great feare, séeing that so many waies and times we are
deceited by you, with sodaine and vnlooked for doubts: Alas,
what is he dead? he, that onely y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hope that I had to sée him;
did sustaine my whole life? As all humaine creatures hath

the waters doth swell by force of raine, the windes

I suppose that none of all these perills hath chaunced vnto

the knight of the Sunne hath trauailed through many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

knew the great griefe that would procéede thereof: but yet
she was so much importuned, that in the ende she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained

               <p>Ah my Ladie and Emprisse, I would (if that God were
so pleased) that this newes that I doe bring you, were of
the death of the knight of the Sunne, how that the vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
waues of the Sea had swallowed him vp, or else how
that the ground had opened and he consumed therein. For if
that it had happened in this sort, then should you haue no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassion

wheras y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sight of an other ladie hath made him captiue, &amp; al
your loue forgotten, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> recouerie is without remedie. For
after our departure out of Grecia, til we came to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>gran Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taio,</hi>
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> knight of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Sun neuer left y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> princes <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>much
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> her great beautie &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrought such
<pb facs="tcp:13995:19"/>
effect within his heart, that you were cleane blotted out of
his remembraunce, and the promise that he made vnto you
cleane forgotten: so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in the way of our trauaile, he did offer
himselfe whollie vnto her, intreating of loue, and made her
prontise that so soone as they should come vnto the <hi>Gran
Cataia,</hi> he would marrie her, the which promise, she did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
by reason whereof she did make her defence, till such
time as they came vnto the court of the Emperour <hi>Alican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,</hi>
where as they were with great pompe and maiestie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceued.
So the daie of the marriage being appointed, all the
nobles of the land were called and assembled together, and
for the space of twentie daies that I was there, they gaue
themselues to no other thing but to bankets and feasting, for
the marriage of the Princesse, whereas the knight of the
Sunne did so high and wonderfull feates of armes, that his
fame will neuer be forgotten in that countrie. To conclude,
I séeing that the time was short and at hande, for the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
of the marriage, with great sorow and griefe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from thence, and made so great haste as possible I
could, for to come hether to giue you to vnderstand thereof.
So whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Empresse <hi>Claridiana</hi> had heard these newes
of so great dolour and griefe, and vnderstoode the whole ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
thereof, there was no paine, torment &amp; griefe that might
be compared vnto hers at that present, neither was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sufficiencie in her heroicall and baliant courage (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
she did quaile &amp; ouercome those terrible guards of the
Princesse, <hi>Elisea)</hi> for to suffer and to dissemble so cruel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
and peruerst fortune, but that losing the vse of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce,
(as one past all hope) she fell in a sownd in
the armes of her Damsell <hi>Arcanie,</hi> whereas she remained
more then one whole houre, before she came againe vnto her
selfe, in such sorte, that <hi>Arcania</hi> who did helpe her, thought
verelie that she was dead altogether, and did repent her selfe
that euer she did declare vnto her those heauie newes. In
the ende, the Princes came againe somewhat vnto her selfe,
who in mortall anguish did yeald out: from her troubled
breast such cruell sighes, as though her life would follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13995:19"/>
then she began to saie as followeth.</p>
               <p>Oh high and soueraigne maiestie, how is it that your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
maiestie doth permit and suffer, that your Empresse
<hi>Claridiana</hi> should receiue so great treason, and especiallie of
him, whom in al the world she best loued. Oh false and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
knight, now am I fullie certified or y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> occasion of thy
long tarrying, and thy dispitefull wordes and promises are
manifest vnto me, as also who doth detaine thée: Oh knight
of the Sunne, what mist of darknesse hath daseled thy eyes,
that the sight of the princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> could so bleare and
blot out of thy memorie the figure of <hi>Claridiana.</hi> Be these
the effect of thy amorous words which thou vtteredst vnto
me comming by sea from <hi>Lidia,</hi> and the fained teares that
thou diddest impart with me. How oftentimes diddest thou
desire me for to receue thée to be mine, &amp; after y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I offered my
selfe to be thine: consider of thy promise made vnto mée, the
which now thou hast vtterlie falsified and broken. If thou
haddest well considered (O thou traitor) who I was, &amp; how
that my desert is without comparison, thou wouldest neuer
haue changed me for anie other, and that which séemeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me to be without reason is, that thou hast matched with
one that is not of thy lawe and faith: What was become
of thy wits, and where was thy vnderstanding, that thou
diddest not see and consider, how much thou hast offended the
soueraigne creator with that marriage, and how worthie
thou art of punishment, in committing of such wretched sin.
I doe not now much meruaile, that thou hast not kept thy
word and faith with me, when thou hast not kept thy faith
with the liuing God, neither doe I meruaile at the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of so great sinne, for that not long since, thou fainedlie
diddest take the name to be a Christian, the which I doe sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
thou hast reiected and denied. And the better to bring
thy pupose to effect, thou doest publish thy selfe to be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.
Oh that the wrath of the diuine iustice might now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
vpon thée, and the burning lightnings and thunder en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered
in the high clowves, might make reuengement on

and dangers, that I suspected to chaunce to thée, or else
that thou hadst died with some sodaine &amp; vnlooked for death.
What cruell death, punishment, or euill fortune, might bée
conformable vnto thy desert, in committing so great an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
There is nothing that grieueth me so much, as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thou
wert the floure of all knights, and being gone, there is not
in all the world that is worthie of my excellencie: &amp; although
I am not married, yet doe I remaine a widow, &amp; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my griefe, to sée him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which I thought should haue ben
my husband, in the power of another. Oh fortune, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
haue you bene vnto me, in that you haue giuen me so
great beautie and soueraigne dignitie. If thou haddest cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
me foule, euill fauoured, and of base birth, then had not
the one bene occasion of my pardition, neither the other had
reason for to destroie me. If that my singuler beautie &amp; high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
were not, I might put remedie in my great griefe, as
<hi>Ariadne</hi> that was left of <hi>Theseus,</hi> and <hi>Medea</hi> forgotten of

I may make change of so faithfull loue? What woman is
there in all the world, that euer felt so great griefe for loue?
Trulie there is no comparison to be made vnto mine: no

thing that I haue in most estimation, and séeing that death
is ordained for all mortall creatures, wherein may I better
emploie the same than in your seruice. Come on let vs goe

vs venture our liues, and offer it as a sacrifice for to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish

wordes, but the knightes of the Prince had grapled their
ships together, and boording the one the other, in such sorte,
that they might well leape out of the one into the other,
<hi>Don Siluerio</hi> accompained with the most valiant knightes
that were with him, with his sword in his hand &amp; his shéeld

side, and with a loude voice he saide: O <hi>Rosicleer</hi> yéeld thy
selfe straight waies vnto my curtesie, &amp; surrender the prise
that thou hast in thy power, for that fortune cannot so much
fauour thee, for to escape out of my handes. But <hi>Rosicloer</hi>

be séene of all that were there in the Fléete, with a naked

the oppressing of so great a multitude of their contraries, in

hoping at her hands to receiue reward for the same, he
should now be constrained therefore to die, and to leaue her
in the power of another, hauing this in his remembraunce,
lifting vp his eies vnto heauen to aske mercie of God for
his sinnes, he sawe his welbeloued mistres in a sound in the
armes of <hi>Fidelia,</hi> as she which made no other reckoning but
to die, the which did cause vnto him so great dolour &amp; griefe,
that it kindled in him mortall wrath and ire, determined to
sell his life verie déere vnto them that so much desired his
death, wherewith hée tooke his sword in both his handes,
and stroke so terrible a blowe at the Captaine <hi>Bramides,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the wast, that cutting him in two péeces, he ouerthrew
him dead to the ground, and therewith at other sixe blowes
he slew other sixe knightes, behauing himselfe so amongest
them, that they fled from him as from the death. But hée as
<pb facs="tcp:13995:26"/>
one that had his death certaine, without anie care of his life,
all alone he maintained the battaile against the knightes of
<hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> for that his friends could not doe anie thing in
his defence they weare so wearie. And although the knights
of <hi>Lusitania</hi> were valiant, and did charge him with many
heauie blowes, that had bene sufficient to haue cloue aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field
in péeces, yet did he defend the entrie of the ship alone,
for the space of halfe an houre against all the companie, and
had about him on euery side a great number of dead bodies,
shewing so great wonders among his aduersaries, that it
was scarce credible to the beholders. Whereat <hi>Don Silue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>
receiued great griefe to sée so many of his knights slain,
but yet he durst not come nigh him himselfe, but forced his
knights forwards with reproch, that it was a shame to him,
that one alone knight shoulde make his defence so long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
so many. Who hearing those wordes made no more
a doe, but put their liues in aduenture for to accomplish that
which was their deaths, and therewith they leaped into the
ship of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and charged him so much &amp; with so many
terrible and heauie blowes, that it had not bene possible for
him to haue indured long, if that by the wonderfull myracle
of God he had not bene succoured.</p>
               <p>You shall vnderstand that fortune did serue him so wel,
that the ship wherein was that valiant and worthie knight
of the Sunne, and that stout <hi>Oristedes</hi> was constrained by

waies did sée the execution of that cruell battaile, and were
greatlie amased to sée all the water so stained with bloud,
and how that one alone ship did make his defence against
all the rest: but when they sawe so few knightes did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
themselues against so great a multitude of their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
their meruaile was the more, and remained astonied
for a great space to sée the incredible acts that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> dyd,
as one that was desperate of his own life, which was with
so great courage, that if he had séene it with his owne eyes,
he could not haue beléeued that any humane creature could

against his aduersaries, and made so great a slaughter
amongst them, that in a short space al the hatches of the ship

before them with all the speede they could into their owne
ships, and in making such hast, many of them leaped short &amp;
fell into the water, so that by this meanes their shippe was

heard those comfortable words of his worthie brother, and
knew him as well by his wonderfull blowes giuen, as by
the deuice of his armour, what ioy and pleasure might bée
equall vnto his, I saie vnto you, it was much more than it

his power the fayre Princesse <hi>Oliuia.</hi> And as one who by
the aide and succour of his Brother was in good hope to be
set frée and at libertie of so rigorous and cruell a traunce,
<pb facs="tcp:13995:27"/>
with a new and vnlooked for ioye, did so hearter, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
himselfe, recouering so great force and strength, that hée
began to make so great a destruction among his enimies, as
though the battaile were but as then begun, and comming
nigh vnto the knight of the Sunne, he sayde: Oh my Lorde
and welbeloued brother, what great benefit is this that God
hath shewed vnto me, that it hath pleased him that I am
succoured by your great power and strength, and now that
I find my selfe in your companie, if that all the whole world
were against me, I should not haue anie feare. At this time
the knight of the Sunne could not make him anie answere,
for that he was so occupied amongst his enimies, where hée
did so great slaughter, that there was none that durst tarrie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that it was wonderfull to beholde, at whom <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was
greatlie amazed, not knowing who that valiant and worthie
knight should be. Then the king <hi>Sacridoro</hi> and the other
Princes, when they sawe that sodain and soueraigne fauour
which was come vnto them, &amp; how that their enimies were
brought into a greater straight than they were before, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were verie wearie and ouercome with labour,
yet the ioy which they receiued did renue in them so great
strength, that they returned vpon their enimies, and slewe
many of them with their terrible blowes, &amp; the feare which
the knights of <hi>Don Siluerio</hi> receiued by the great prowesse
of the knight of the Sunne and the Troyan was such, that
there was not one that durst giue anie attempt, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew

that in a small time there remained in the ships none

that in all the worlde is not his like, but the other that is
come with him I know not, but his valiant demeanour doth

for that good fortune she had to meete them. Then she embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with great loue the Princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> who with great
ioy dyd receiue her, being either of them verie much amazed
at the strange beautie the one of the other, and verie gladde
that they should enter together into <hi>Grecia.</hi> So with great
ioye and delight they sailed on their voiage, and had so gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
conuersation amongst themselues, that they neuer felt
the trauaile of the sea. There dyd the Princes, <hi>Zoylo, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandel,</hi>

               <p>So passing the time with these and other such like sports

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the next morning was come, the good
King <hi>Sacridoro</hi> went a land, beeing armed
with his whole armour verie richlie, alonely
with one Squire, and entered into <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
who finding the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi>
and the Empresse <hi>Briana</hi> in the great hall
together, without anie dolour he came in whereas they were,
who when they sawe him, receiued him with great ioy and
pleasure, as well for that he was so great a friend vnto their
sonne <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> as also because they hoped to heare some
newes from him, the which they longed verie much for, for
of long time they had not heard from him. Then the king
went to kisse the hands of the Emperour, who did embrace
him with great loue, and said: King <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> my verie good
friend, you are heartelie welcome into this Countrie, for
with your comming I doe receiue great ioy and pleasure.
Therefore tel me what is become of your greatest friend <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer,</hi>
for that I meruaile greatlie that he is not come in
your companie, &amp; I am fullie perswaded that it is a great
thing that should depart you a sunder. Then the king after
that he had done his due reuerence, answered him and said:
Mightie Emperour, I came in the companie of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi>
and God forbidde that so long as I liue, I shoulde sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
my selfe out of his companie, for therewith I receive
more honour and contentment, than with all the whole
kingdome of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> the which I holde by his valyant
worthinesse. And héere I giue you to vnderstand (most
<pb facs="tcp:13995:30"/>
high renowmed princes) that your mightie valiant &amp; most
worthie sonnes, the knight of the Sunne and <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> are
in the port of this Citie, accompanied with worthie &amp; vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
princes and knights, and doe bring in their companie,
the most excelent and faire princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> daughter vnto
the puisant king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> whome <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> falling in loue
with, did by force of his strong arme, take out of the court of
the king her father, and with one alone shippe (in the which
we are come) made his defence at the sea, against more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
sire thousand knights, &amp; there did he shew vnto him a great
part of all that had passed in that enterprise, and of the
great sorow which he receued for the worthie knight of the
Sunne and of <hi>Oristedes</hi> his friend, as also how by fortune
at the sea they met with the prince <hi>Clauerindo,</hi> who brought

                     </gap>nides,</hi>
with the whole discourse how he brought her out of
the castle, in such sort as he tolde them at the sea. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Emperour and the Empresse heard these newes, they
receued great ioy and comfort thereat, &amp; as those who haue
great experience in cases of loue, did not greatly meruaile
at that which <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did for the loue of <hi>Oliuia,</hi> likewise
they receued content, for that he had accomplished his desire,
being fullie certified that the princesse should inherit the
kingdome of great Britaine, after the deceace of the king
her father, and how that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> could not marrie with a
damsell in all the world of more higher estate. Also theyr
ioy did encreace at the newes of the comming of the knight
of the Sunne. Then the Emperour and the Empresse dyd
render vnto the king <hi>Sacridoro</hi> great thankes, for that he
would come to bring them so ioyfull newes. And the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
did straight waies commaund his nobles and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
princes &amp; knights that were then present in his court,
to be in a redinesse for to goe and receue them, who in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
with them all with great pomp &amp; maiestie, went forth
of the Citie with so great a troupe, that all those wide and
broade fieldes were full of people, for that when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of these two princes were published &amp; knowen, there
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13995:30"/>
were few or none that remained, but all went forth for to
receue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Emperour went in the middest of all those
Princes and knightes, and by him the good King <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doro,</hi>
with so graue and seuere countenance, that he dyd
very well manifest his high estate. So when that they came
vnto the sea port, at the sound of Trumpets &amp; other kinds
of instruments, these princes did disembarke themselues a
land; <hi>Rosicleer</hi> brought by the hand his welbeloued princesse
<hi>Oliuia,</hi> who was of so great beautie, that all that did behold
her were greatly amazed, so that there grew betwixt diuers
great contention, whether that the beautie of the Princes
<hi>Claridiana</hi> did excéede the beautie of the princesse <hi>Lindabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
but all in generall said, that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> had great reason to
put himselfe in such perill, for the loue of so faire a ladie.</p>
               <p>Then straight waies came forth the faire <hi>Lindaraza,</hi> whose
beautie did worke no lesse admiration in the beholders, then
the princesse, and was lead by that worthie knight of the
Sunne her brother, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with those renowmed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>Clauarindo, Bargandel,</hi> and <hi>Liriamandro,</hi> likewise with
the Tartarian <hi>Zoylo,</hi> and the good Troyan <hi>Oristedes,</hi> and
the valiant king <hi>Alamades</hi> of Cornewaile, all the which
came foorth so séemely and richly aryed, that it put in great
admiration all them that did behold them.</p>
               <p>So when they all came before the Emperour (who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceued
great ioy and pleasure to sée his two worthie sonnes &amp;
those two so excelent Princesses, he went &amp; embraced them
with great pleasure &amp; delight, but in especial, the two faire
Ladies, saying, I am much more bound vnto God then any
other man in the world, and to giue him greater thanks, for
that he hath not alone brought mée to the sight and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
of my two so valiant sonnes, but also by them I
haue recouered and obtained for my daughters, two so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
Princesses, as the like are not to be founde in all the
world. How is it that by my desert I am worthie to sée in
mine Empire of Grecia, so high and soueraigne beauties,
as these worthie peeres are.</p>
               <p>Then they did hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues vpon their knées before the
<pb facs="tcp:13995:31"/>
Emperour, and would haue kissed his handes, but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
would not consent therevnto, but returned and dyd
embrace them a new, &amp; caused them to arise fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground,
and then with excéeding ioy and pleasure he gaue entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vnto his sonnes, and vnto those high Princes and
Knights, saying vnto <hi>Bargandel, Lyriamandro,</hi> &amp; <hi>Zoilo:</hi> now
my verie good friends am I satisfied, séeing that with so ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
comming you wil requite me the euill newes, the which
you gaue mée in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of the death of my sonne
<hi>Rosicleer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this shall your highnesse sée, said <hi>Zoylo,</hi> how far your
good fortune doth extend, &amp; the more to estéeme the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
of your sonne, Fortune wold first present before you
those so sodaine and heauie newes of great dolour, that after
when it should be found vnto the contrarie, the ioy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
might be the more. Then the Emperour did embrace
them all one after another, &amp; receiued so great contentment
to sée those so worthie knights that brought his sonnes, that
he neuer rested, nor could not bée satisfied in giuing thankes
vnto almightie God, for exalting him vnto so high estate.
Likewise they were no lesse amazed at the surpassing and
gentle disposition of the Emperour, and the great maiestie
that hée dyd represent in his person, they dyd beholde him
with great attention, and sayde within themselues, that hée
was worthie to bée Father of those two Myrrors of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode
throughout all the worlde. And the Princesses <hi>Oliuia</hi>
and <hi>Lindaraza</hi> receiued meruailous greate contentment to
sée what great loue and humanitie he shewed vnto all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and what great ioye and pleasure he receiued of their
comming. So after that ther had passed much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication,
in this their first méeting, then the other Princes <hi>Rodamar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi>
and <hi>Rodofeo,</hi> and other noble men that came in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Emperour, went &amp; welc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mmed their noble Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who dyd embrace and receiue them with great ioy and
loue. This being done, the Emperour and all the rest moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vpon their horses, and the two princesses vpon their pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraies,
which were brought thether for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wel garnished, &amp;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13995:31"/>
tooke their waie towards the mightie Citie of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
accompanied with so many knightes and Citizens, that
all the mightie wide and broade fields seemed to be couered
with them. In this sort they entered into the Citie with
great maiestie &amp; pompe, whereas was so meruailous sweet
noise of all kindes of instruments and musicke, that it was
thought (that the entring of <hi>Caesar</hi> into <hi>Rome</hi> af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er his great
victorie) was not equall vnto this, and passing through the
stréetes of the Citie, the windowes were furnished with
Ladies and damsels, who greatlie meruailed at the strange
and excellent beauties of <hi>Oliuia</hi> and <hi>Lindaraza,</hi> and praised
God of all partes for séeing that daie, in the which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
receiued his so worthie sonnes, who brought so great
ioy, contentment, honour, and pleasure vnto that mightie
Court. So when they came vnto the mightie pallace, <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raza</hi>
was alighted from her Palsraie in the armes of the
knight of the Sunne her brother, and the faire <hi>Oliuia</hi> in the
armes of the Emperour, who would not consent that anie
other should doe it, and at their ascending vp into the greate
hall, there the Empresse <hi>Briana</hi> accompanied with al her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Gentlewomen came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orth and did receiue the two
Ladies, embracing them with so great loue, as though they
had bene her owne naturall dauhters. But when she sawe
the great beautie and soueraigne grace of the Princesse <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuia,</hi>
she receiued within her selfe a meruailous great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
and thanked God for the good fortune that <hi>Rosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi>
had obtained for the recouering of her. Then the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
both of them did knéele downe before the Empresse, &amp;
would haue kissed her hands, but she would not consent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
same, but caused them to arise, and with great loue shée
sayde. Ah precious and déere daughters, what great pleasure
doth my heart receiue, and how ioyfull vnto me is this your
comming into this Countrie, and turning vnto <hi>Oliuia</hi> shee
sayd: How much am I bound vnto God, that in loosing the
name of a sister in lawe, I doe inioy you for my Daughter.
So passing betwixt them many amorous and louing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,
came vnto her the knight of the Sunne and
<pb facs="tcp:13995:32"/>
                  <hi>Rosicleer</hi> to kisse her hands, but she dyd embrace them with
so great loue, as vnto so noble &amp; worthie persons did apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gaue she entertainment vnto all the other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
&amp; knights, with so gallant grace &amp; demeanor, that al were
contented therwith, &amp; said, that of so high &amp; worthy parents,
reason is, that they should bring forth so worthie sunnes. So
after that they had spent a good while in these their gréetings
&amp; receiuings, they entered into a meruailous faire and great
quadran, where al these knights were vnarmed, &amp; had giuen
vnto them rich &amp; precious robes to couer them, the which
being done, with great ioy they sate downe to dinner, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they were serued with so great maiestie, as did wel agrée
vnto their high estates. Thus with great delight vnto them
all, they remained certaine daies making great triumphs, &amp;
exercising meruailous feates of armes, whereas the stout
Troyan, the king <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> and the Tartarian <hi>Zoylo</hi> with
the other worthie Princes, gaue such testimonie of their
bountie, that from that time forwardes they were estéemed
as their worthinisse did deserue. In this time was <hi>Rosicleer</hi>
in so great ioy and pleasure, as before hée sawe himselfe in
sorrow and sadnesse, for he had his welbeloued <hi>Oliuia</hi> in his
power, and that there was concluded &amp; finished all his cares
and mortall griefs that he had receiued for her cause, so that
there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as no pleasure in all the world that might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
vnto his, wherewith he went as one from himselfe,
thinking himselfe not worthie to inioy so great glorie. The
Princesse <hi>Oliuia</hi> likewise receiued no lesse contentment, for
calling to remembrance the great trauaile &amp; afflictions that
she had sustained and passed for her welbeloued friend,
and now séeing her selfe frée and cléere from them all, and
put in so high estate, she thought verilie that there was not
a Ladie nor Gentle woman in all the world so fortunate as
shée, so that the ioy of them both was without comparison,
which was cleane contrarie vnto the knight of the Sunne,
for that he found not there the Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
caused vnto him great anguish and griefe. And béeing
in such sort, that hée could not suffer nor abide it, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13995:32"/>
straight waies to depart toward <hi>Trapisonda,</hi> at such
time as he saw that the Emperour his Father was most in
quiet, and when that his departure should lesse grieue him,
otherwise he would not for all the world doe that whereby
he should receiue anie displeasure. For you shall vnderstand
that this knight and <hi>Rosicleer</hi> his brother, amongst all other
vertues with the which they were indued, this did surmount
all the rest, for that there was not a knight in all the world
that better dyd loue their Father than these two, for that
they did not alonelie serue and honour him, but the more to
exalt his maiestie, not one of them in his presence woulde
make anie estimation of themselues, but would that all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and reuerence should be giuen vnto him onlie, who for
the worthinesse of his person dyd deserue the same. So that
the knight of the Sunne, for not displeasing him in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
did passe awaie his anguish and griefes as well as
he could, thinking euerie houre a whole yéere till such time
as he might sée his <hi>Claridiana.</hi> This might be a spectacle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all such as hath Fathers, for to procure and doe as this
knight did, for to make equall his pastimes and pleasures
vnto the troubles and necessities of his Father, alwaies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
and procuring his honour more than his owne, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
before his eyes neuer to haue quietnesse nor rest, at
such time as his father is in anie trouble, for that the gift of
the father, although it be not profitable to his possessions, yet
is hée most excellent to giue counsaile, and profitable vnto
the sonne: and is neuer wel knowen till such time as hée is
lost, when that with many sighs and teares it ought to bée
bewailed. Who is he that would not séeme to be a good child
vnto his parents, if he do well consider how troublesome his
bringing vp hath bene vnto them, and how that his life is
but a burthen of anger and sorrowes, sonnes of great griefe,
a continuall labour &amp; timerous care? How many times are
we the occasion to make frustrate their desires, &amp; a breaking
of their sound sléepes, taking awaie their stomackes, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures?
How many sodain feares &amp; griefs caused by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ance
<pb facs="tcp:13995:33"/>
of our actions, and many times the disgrace and death of the
sonnes, is cause of the death of their mothers. And y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which
is more, many with the ouermuch pleasure and ioy receiued,
to heare how that their children be aliue, dieth sodainlie, as
it chanced vnto those two, the same daie that they returned
vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> that dyd remaine and escaped from the losse of
<hi>Trasimeno,</hi> when as they sawe their sonnes aliue, whereas
before it was certified them that they were slaine, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no measure to eschue so great and sodaine ioy, dyd die
presentlie therewith. Therefore séeing that the loue of the
parents is so great vnto their children, he is worthy of great
punishment that doth not honour them, and shall haue lesse
reason to leaue vndone, that which is a common Prouerbe,
that the whole fault consisteth in the Father, for that many
times the hardnesse of the Father is profitable vnto the
sonne, and alwaie the cockering of them is hurtfull, because
we that be sonnes and youthfull, be alwaies stubburne, and
cannot be mollified but by stubburnnesse, as many times it
falleth out, that the pittiful Chyrurgion leaueth the wound
euill cured, wherof did grow the olde custome that was vsed
amongst the Romanes, that not alonelie Princes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulles,
vnto whome was giuen the whole power ouer the
common wealth against such as did offend, but also all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
fathers had iurisdiction ouer their children, to punish
them, and to put them in prison, tormenting them, yea, and
to put them to death. The crueltie of <hi>Cassio</hi> and <hi>Fuluio</hi> was
much estéemed in putting to death of their sonnes, not for
that they did hate them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but because they coulde not correct
their customes. So that the sonne must vnderstand that the
good Father must not séeke who should cocker &amp; make much
of him, but one that may doe him good. And many thinges
doth séeme vnto the sonne to be verie hard &amp; terrible, which
seemeth vnto the Father to be verie profitable. Neither is
he deceiued therein, for that his affection is not with passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and youth hath no more consideration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> than that which is
before his eies, and waring riper in yéeres, he séeth many
things a far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e of, and alwaies the seueritie of the father, is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13995:33"/>
more profitable vnto the sonne than méeknesse. It is a
strange thing to consider, that a man can better suffer the
hardnesse of a tyrannous maister, than of his owne Father,
the which although they be not alowable, yet should not they
reproue their fathers, but rather suffer them. We reade that
<hi>Alexander</hi> did neuer incurr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> so great reproch, as in that hee
dyd not onelie rebuke his Father, but that hée was also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious,
and receiued griefe at his ertollings. Wise men saie,
that there is no superioritie on the earth more iuster than
that of the Father, nor more honester subiection than that of
the sonne, therefore let children honour their parents, &amp; shew
their due duties vnto them with reuerence: and not doing
the same, it is a iust sentence that rebellious sonnes doth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.
And this punishment is not so small, but vnto him that
suffereth, it séemeth verie much, for that there is nothing

to be so estéemed and beloued with so great reuerence of his

that he bare vnto them, did constraine them for to loue him,
and shew him humble reuerence. Also when that their sons
doe not proue to be good, then ought their Fathers to suffer
and beare with them, til such time as their childhood is past,

nature, forcing them to leaue their vice, wherto they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,

to thinke well of the same.</p>
               <p>Thus as the Court of that mightie Emperour was in

that dyd reade those wonders, meruailed greatlie at the
strange thinges which <hi>Rosicleer</hi> had passed, and were verie
glad that all his trauailes &amp; troubles for loue were brought
to so good an end. And for that there was not written, nor
anie mencion made of the wonderful acts done by the knight
of the Sunne, the Emperour dyd aske of the wise man
wherfore they were forgotten? Who answered him in the
presence of all the nobles in the Court, that hée dyd leaue
off the writing of them, for that there was another greate
wise man who had better intelligence thereof than hée, and
had the charge for to write and put in memorie all things
that toucheth the knight of the Sunne, and how that before

And although the mightie Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> and

the meaning thereof, but he excused himselfe, saying, that it
was not giuen vnto him for to declare that which was to

if it should fall out to proue to the contrarie, it would be the
occasion of great daunger, harme &amp; perill. But yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

haue so valiant a sonne, who for the worthinesse of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should be sufficient to sustaine that estate, as he did get
it in his life time. And with this determination and desire,
he made many sacrifices vnto the Gods, desiring them to
giue him such a sonne to bée his heire, of no lesse force and
strength than he was for the defence of those kingdomes.
At the same time there was in one of those Ilandes a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

the time long to sée himselfe on the iourney, and requested
his Father that hée might goe with him, for that hée would
that his mightie power were manifest vnto all the worlde.
Then <hi>Bradaman</hi> who desired no other thing did graunt him

than all the rest) that amongst so many mightie kings
and noble Lordes that are héere present, and subiect vnto
this sacred Empire, there is not one amongst you but hath
béene (and I suppose will bée) loiall and faithfull, which is
the thing that Princes ought to haue in greatest price, for
that it is no lesse perillous and daungerous vnto a King that
hath a peruerse and an vnreasonable subiect, than for a man
of meaner or baser sorte to haue a strong and mightie eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.
So that now for that I am fullie perswaded and certe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of the great fidelitie &amp; truth that you haue alwaies vsed

a matter whereof you are not ignorant, not for that
therein you should do ought to accomplish my will, but that
you should aide and helpe me with your good counsailes, for
that in great and profound matters one must propone, and
many must determine. I thinke it is not néedfull to make
much relating thereof, because it is well knowen vnto you
all, how the knight of the Sunne, and sonne vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of <hi>Grecia</hi> came into this land, and was receiued &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by vs, with so great loue and good will, as though
it had bene the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> our sonne. Likewise how
that it was our pleasure to marrie him vnto the Princesse
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13995:41"/>
                  <hi>Lindabrides</hi> our daughter, the which was almost concluded
and celebrated, whether it was his euil hap, or vnhappie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
vpon a night he departed, and left our daughter flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
&amp; vs astonied &amp; ashamed, in recompence of the great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that we did and shewed vnto him. All the which doth
not grieue vs so much for our parte, for the euill sact done
vnto vs, as it doth for the great offence done therein vnto
the immortall Gods, beleeuing that a greater could not haue
bene inuented vpon the earth, nor a thing more contrarie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their diuine maiestie. What Emperor, King, Prince,
or Knight amongst mortall men, that durst be so bold as to
refuse or take vnto his wife the Princes <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> being
successour, descending from the diuine stocke, but this onelie
knight of the Sunne. Of truth and with great reason may
the diuine Gods execute their wrath vppon vs, if so be that
we doe not reuenge this great iniurie done vnto vs, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
vnto their diuine maiesties: and with no lesse reason
their diuine iustice may fall vpon you, if that (not onely with
your subiects and goods) but also your selues in person doe
not procure to make this reuengeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. A man ought to haue
a respect vnto the griefes &amp; offences done vnto themselues,
but much more the wrongs which are done against the high
Gods. We doe well vnderstand, that for to take reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the knight of the Sun, it cannot be so easilie done,
but it will cost vs many people and much treasure, yea, and
our owne persons in the performance thereof, but yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
your mightie power, strength, and valiant hearts, we
doe beleeue that it doth not astonish you, neither do you feare
to take vppon you this iourney, for that greate delayes
doth proceede of little prudence, and feare, of great coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but heroicall knightes, such as doe procure to haue a
fame in al the world, with equal courage ought to offer their
persons in doubtfull attempts as well as in prosperous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
&amp; with like constancie to harden themselues against
afflictions, as vnto delights &amp; pleasures. Of our owne part,

yet if it so be concluded that we shall take this iourney
vpon vs, so farre off, and so costlie, wée will that you doe no
more therein, than you sée vs to doe, as trauailing by the
waie, nauigating by Sea, cléering our passage, assaulting our
enimies, in all these wée will bée the first, and not the last.
To conclude, our verie good friends are desirous to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of this great iniurie done vnto vs by the knight of the
Sun, &amp; that you wold not thinke (agreeing héereto with vs)
that these our white haires shall lacke good wil for to passe

the immortall Gods, (not alonelie to bee reuenged of this
iniury done vnto vs) but also to make subiect vnto our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated

that the diuine prouidence hath permitted this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to be done, that we should haue occasion for to destroie
the whole power of the Christians. We do not meane héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to bring vnto your remembrance, how oftentimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in times past in this Countrie, the Emperors &amp; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines

that were their friends &amp; subiects vnto y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi>
in executing whereof, they did neither respect the largenesse

may be found in your noble minds, neither so many
mightie kings &amp; Princes as be here present to consent to the
contrarie, but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> this great iniurie should be reuenged. Now
séeing that we haue declared vnto you the occasion of calling
you together vnto this our court of Parliament, we do desire
you so let vs haue your iudgements vpon this that we haue

When all those that were present with the Emperour

                           <p>MOst high and mightie Emperour &amp; our Lord, I would

this grieuous case, which you haue declared
vnto vs, for that you haue it for custome to aske counsaile of
your nobles in causes of importaunce and things requisite.
And yet in the end saie they what they can, yéelding their
iudgements according vnto reason, all things must be done
according vnto your desire &amp; will, whether it be good or bad,
giuing to vnderstand, that the counsaile which you doe aske
of your nobles &amp; subiects, is more to complie with them, than
anie good will you haue to be counsailed. But yet for all this,
although I doe know, that my iudgement in this case will
bée as much as nothing, and will bée conceiued to another
intent &amp; purpose contrarie vnto my meaning, yet will I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it, for that héereafter you shall not complaine at anie
<pb facs="tcp:13995:43"/>
time of the olde king of <hi>Gedrosia,</hi> in that he did not aduise
you in time that you might proue your fortune. And héere
I protest before the immortall Gods, that this which I doe
pretend to saie vnto you, is not so much for the feare &amp; dread
the which I haue of the Gréekes, as it is for the great loue &amp;
good wil which I do beare vnto you and to al our Countrie.
I would not (most mightie Lord) that you shuld put so great
confidence &amp; trust in this your puisant &amp; high estate, thinking
therewith to be verie firme and sure, voide of the subiection
of vncertaine and immutable fortune, and neuer to slide or
fall from the high throne in which you are exalted, if you do
beléeue this to be true. There are many things past in this
world long since of mightie Princes, that if you will enter
into iudgement of them rightlie, as you ought for to doe, you
shall plainlie sée and perceiue that it is all false and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
as a spectacle of many <hi>Caesars</hi> Romanes, in which time
past were Lords and rulers ouer all the world, as <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,

Constantio, Valente, Graciano, Valentiniano,</hi> and an
infinit number more, which hath béene ouerthrowen from
the imperiall throne in the which Fortune did exalt them,
and no other occasion to the same, but that all humane
things hath no securitie nor firmnesse, and hée that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
and set in the highest of the whéele of mooueable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
the same is most apt and readiest to fall. And in this
thing you may beléeue me, that looke how much the humane
power doth surmount, so much is the Empire, or what estate
so euer it be, subiect vnto fortune, and all the great fire laden
with wood, is charged with the mightie windes in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
partes: euen so likewise (most mightie Emperour)
this estate is not so high, but it hath with it great perill,
so that you néede not to goe and séeke other daungers in
strange Countries so farre from this, that when it shal fall
out, all thing to succéede and bée prosperous vnto you, yet
shall it bée greate meruaile, if you doe returne backe againe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13995:43"/>
aliue into your owne countrie, how much more the victorie
against the Gréekes is so vncertaine, and as you may make
iust accompt thereof, although you think it to the contrarie,
without any consideration of peruerse fortune, which may
so fall out, that they shall remaine al libertie, and you decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
although the host of men which you may carie, wil be
a great multitude, mightie and strong, yet many times it
falleth out, that the greatest host is ouercome by the lesser,
as it happened vnto <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and vnto <hi>Darius,</hi> and a great
number more, who with hosts of innumerable companie of
people were destroyed and ouercome. Likewise before that
this shall come in effect, if you doe well consider, and haue
an eye into the great angers and molestacions, presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
alterations, and contrarieties, which doth happen daylie
in these mightie hostes. I beleue that you will think it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to remaine and liue at home in your owne countrie, then
to passe into Grecia with so mightie an host, for that there
is no iniuries nor cruelties that may be compared vnto the

then you doe now at this present, yet that which all his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

&amp; <hi>Valentiniano,</hi> the least of all these were good &amp; valiant
men, and yet slaine by the hands of those of their host. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
I will declare the great perills and misfortunes that
happeneth at the sea, by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which you must of necessitie passe
this your great multitude of people, I would it were not

is well knowen vnto all men, how readie y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mightie windes
<pb facs="tcp:13995:44"/>
are to augment perills, the mightie, greate and vnmercifull
waues, the hidden rockes vnder the water, the continuall
tempests and whirle windes. What is that so strong, that
the power of the heauens and the sea doe not rent and teare
all to péeces, and carrie awaie by sodaine stormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests
of the windes, and therefore it is said that the going to
the sea is easie, but the comming from the sea is perillous,
but putting all the perills and daungers a parte, and that
Fortune wil shew her selfe fauourable vnto you in all these
affaires, and that with prosperous windes and times you
are entered into the Empire of <hi>Grecia,</hi> yet I would you
should consider and knowe, how doubtfull is the victorie at
that present, for that in all thinges hope is doubtfull, and
much more in great warres and contentions. Uerie prudent
and well experimented in armes was hée that saide, that
there is nothing that hath his ende more vncertaine than
the warre, and that it is farre better a certaine and sure
peace, than the hoped victorie. One thing all you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue
of a certaine, that verie few or none entereth into bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
without hope of victorie, but yet consider if it bée not a
thing that hath often happened, the losse of the ouercome to
be lesse than of the ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers. How many times doth men
goe vnto the warres in hope to haue the victorie, and to the
contrarie, remaines ouercome, and that which is worst, they
remaine dead in the field, so that they returne not backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to their houses ouercome, nor with victorie. And yet
will I say more in contradiction of your hope, that if you did
know of a verie certaintie and truth, that the victorie should
be on your parts against the Gréekes, yet for all that I will
not let to giue you counsaile for to remaine in quiet at home
in your owne Countrie, for as the victorie is alwaies doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

it may be your lot before any other, for that your enimies
(as vpon the principall staie of your host) will seeke to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
your death. How sodainlie &amp; vnlooked for may you méet
with the knight of the Sun, he that was heere in your court,
at which tune you would willingly giue all that now you do
possesse, for to be as farre distant from him as you are at this
present. Of truth according vnto his furie &amp; great worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
brauerie &amp; stoutnesse, the which experience hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, by the incredible things done in sight of al men in this
court, surelie I shuld thinke no securitie in my life, although
I were in the middest of your great &amp; mighty host, if I were
certaine that he were against me in the field. And héere I do
desire &amp; praie the almightie &amp; immortall Gods, to saue &amp; kéep
thée from his furious hands, for surelie my heart doth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to heare you saie that you will goe and seeke him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with him. Héere is now in presence <hi>Rodaran</hi> king of
<hi>Arabia,</hi> and the king of <hi>Media,</hi> who hath proued the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his mightie blowes. I doe desire your highnesse to
aske of them, if they haue anie good will to returne and proue
them againe, as also if <hi>Rodaran</hi> be in the same opinion that
he was before he went into <hi>Grecia.</hi> Therefore O high and
mightie Emperour, conserue and maintaine this soueraigne
estate into the which the high and immortall Gods hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
you, and leaue off this enterprise, for to goe and séeke
perilles and daungers in other straunge Countries, for
that innumerable bée the misfortunes that wée are day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
subiect vnto. And you shall not doe little for to conserue
and kéepe that which you doe now possesse. Wise men in
times past dyd not thinke it to bée done with ease (who
sayde) that it was great trauaile to suffer prosperitie, and
that it was necessarie to learne to suffer, hauing Fortune at
will, for that it is more difficult to gouerne himselfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
than in aduersitie.</p>
                           <p>Héere therefore I thinke not amisse to staie my talke,
for that in this which I haue sayde you maye verie well
vnderstand my iudgement, not onelie that you shoulde
restraine from executing your will, but also that you should
<pb facs="tcp:13995:45"/>
seperate and blot it cleane out of your thought and minde, &amp;
neuer more remember it. For that if the knight of the Sun
had done vnto you any iniurie (as hetherto he hath not, for
that possible he would not accept at your handes the thing
which he thought himselfe not worthie of) it were much
better for you to pardon the same, then to séeke reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For an iniurie done vnto so mightie a prince as you
are, it is a small satisfaction the death of one knight, &amp; there
is no forgetfulnesse so generous and noble, as is of him that
hath offended.</p>

               <p>This olde king of <hi>Gedrosia,</hi> had not as yet full concluded
these words (with pretence to goe forwards with his talk)
whan that, that furious youth, <hi>Bramarant</hi> arose vp vpon his
féete, from the place where as he sate next vnto <hi>Bradaman</hi>
his father, with so yreful a semblant, which put great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in all them that dyd behold him, he began to saie these
wordes following.</p>
               <p>With great paine and griefe haue I suffered the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of these thy words, thou light and folish king of
<hi>Gedrosia,</hi> dost thou think that in such sort should be entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the vse of armes amongst knights, as you (who doe call
your selues Philosophers) doth vse them in your scooles &amp;
vniuersities. Dost thou think that the varietie in their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
must of force follow one rule, as you doe imagine, or is
your vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding so simple to conceue that, the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
and strength of men should be equall, and that there should
not some be more stronger and couragious then other.</p>
               <p>Thy counsell were good and profitable for a king that were
foolish, and a coward, as thou arte, but not for so mightie a
prince as the Emperour is. What feare or inconuenience
may that be, to be sufficient to withdraw him from his will,
although it were for to conquere y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whole world, how much
more for to destroy the Empire of <hi>Grecia.</hi> By the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
gods I doe sweare, that if we doe goe thether, I alone
doe thinke for to destroy all the Gréekes, although they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13995:45"/>
This doth procéede of couragious hearts, and any thing
else to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, is of cowardnesse, and although I haue
spent my youth in exercise of armes, more then in reading
of Philosophie: yet doe I know that he that is fearefull can
giue no good counsell for the warres, neither he that is ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
doe any good act therein. And I am fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that <hi>Alexander</hi> had not bene Lord ouer all the world,
if ther had ben any sparke of cowardnesse within his heart,
neither should <hi>Agamemnon</hi> haue destroyed Troy, nor <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,
Sagunto,</hi> nor <hi>Cartago,</hi> nor <hi>Numancia</hi> the <hi>Affricano,</hi>
if they had followed the counsell that thou hast now giuen
vnto the Emperour. Beleue mee, that as commonly fortune
doth sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and valiant of minde, euen so vnto cowards &amp; weake peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
feare is an ill prognostication, as it was of that <hi>Flami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi>
in <hi>Trasimeno,</hi> and of <hi>Crasso</hi> in <hi>Cannas,</hi> and of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peo</hi>
in <hi>Tessalia.</hi> To conclude, for that the Emperour our
Lord doth in these actions that which is nedeful and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit,
he must not follow the iudgements of fooles &amp; cowardlie
Philosophers, but take the counsell of them that be stout,
valiant, and couragious knights, vnto them should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
matters of Iustice, &amp; vnto vs the state of the wars.
For my part, I doe say, that if the Emperour will passe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Grecia,</hi> I will serue him with my owne person: &amp; this
knight of the Sunne (of whome the king of <hi>Gedrosia</hi> hath
so much feare) I wilbe bound to apprehend him, &amp; to bring
him prisoner before his presence, that he may take reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

yet should he not be so mightie as to cleare him selfe out of
my hands.</p>
               <p>So when that <hi>Bramarant</hi> had concluded these words, he
sat himselfe downe againe in his place. There was present
at that time one <hi>Graco,</hi> sonne vnto the king of <hi>Gedrosia,</hi> a
young knight, very valiant and gallant, and very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
vnto many kings that were there in that Court: who seing
with what iniurious wordes his father the king was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
arose vp from his seate and said, as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13995:46"/>
                  <hi>Bramarant,</hi> if thou werte so valiant in thy déedes, as thou
art discourteous in thy wordes, then would not I think
much but thou wouldest acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish all this which thou hast
said against the Gréekes: but I hope in the high and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
gods, that if we goe thether, thou shalt meete with
one alone amongst all the rest, that will make thée for to
know, that thy pride is more then thy déedes, &amp; wil reuenge
the iniurie which thy words hath done vnto my father.</p>
               <p>This valiant <hi>Graco</hi> had not fully concluded these words,
when that the fierce <hi>Bramarant</hi> kindled in wrath, with a
diuelish furie, arose vp from his seate, and went vnto him,
clasping him with one of his handes by the arme, lifting
him vp in the ayre (without hauing any power this young
knight to withstand it) he threw him out of the window
of that great hall, and saide, herein shalt thou sée whether
my deedes be confirmable to my words or not. And for that
the windowes were verie high from the ground, this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<hi>Graco</hi> fell with his head downewards, where as
he was slaine, which was so great sorow and griefe vnto
his father, that he wished the misfortune had chaunced vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him and not vnto his sonne. This king was mightie &amp;
puisant, and had many kings in that court present, which
were his kinsemen, who seeing that which was done by
<hi>Bramarant,</hi> for that they had no armour, (neither could they
be suffered to enter to that court of parliament with anie)
they altogether arose vp and went towards him, thinking
to haue thrown him out of the same window, that he threw
out <hi>Graco,</hi> but their determination fell out contrarie: for

had neither armour nor sword, yet with both his hands he

plume of white feathers bespangled with golde vppon his

it hath bene tolde you in many places, that ouer and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
that this knight was of a high stature, he was therwith
so well proportioned of his bodie, that when hée mounted
vpon his horse béeing armed, there was not a thing of more
wonder to be séene, and all they that did beholde him were
greatlie amazed, whose presence alonelie did declare that hée
should be a knight of great force and strength. So after that
he had moued his courser once about the place, the Emperour
and the Empresse, with al the rest of the Court, being at the
windowes and battlements of the mightie pallace, and al the
whole place ful of people. Then the strange knight began to
moue his mightie courser with so gallant disposition and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that all men did iudge him to be a knight of great force
and strength, and sayd that in his semblance he did resemble
much to <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> who shewed no lesse gallant proportion
and grace than the Knight of the Sunne. And the Emperour
<hi>Trebatio</hi> who was beholding him, and pleased at his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
disposition, sayde vnto them that were with him: The
gallant order and gentle demeanour of this Knight, doeth
make mée beléene, that this battaile will be better fought,
and more doubtfull than wée thought for, and wée shall see
great meruailes therein. So it séemeth vnto mée, sayd the

this battayle till it bee almost night, at such time as the

of the Sunne doth not beginne to kindle. The bountie of
this worthie Prince is so straunge, that the more the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle
doth indure, and the stronger hée is assaulted, it seemeth
that his force and strength doeth the more increase. When

was ordained for their beginning, at the sound wherof they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13995:49"/>
set spurres vnto their coursers, and ranne the one agaynst
the other with great impetuous force, the swiftnesse of their
horses was such, that quicklie they met together, and made
so strong incounters, that by reason their armour was so
excellent, that the sharpe point of their Speares coulde not
enter, their staues were shieuered all to péeces, and they
passed the one by the other so vpright and well setteled, as
though they had not receiued anie encounter at all, but tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their horses about in the aire, and came the one against
the other with their swordes in their handes, and began
to laie on such vnreasonable blowes, that their sheeldes (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were of fine stéele) were quicklie broken all
to peeces, and their guilt mailes were scattered vppon the
ground, and with the furie of their blowes, there procéeded
so many sparkes of fire, that it séemed that they burned, and
the sound of their armour rang lyke an eccho, throughout
the whole Citie. Béeing more than one whole houre ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed,
that these two valiant Knightes beganne their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
yet in such sort dyd they so double <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as though they dyd but as then begin, and no vantage was
knowen of either parte, but either of them beganne to féele
the great strength of his aduersarie. And the knight of the
Sunne, who was meruailous full of wrath, for that one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
knight did endure so long against him in that combat,
in the presence of his Father and mother and those highe
Princes and knightes, sayde within himselfe, that hée ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
combatted with knight before, that dyd so stronglie strike
his blowes, and with so valiant a courage dyd defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but onelie <hi>Rosicleer</hi> his brother, who was hée that
brought him into the greatest perill and necessitie aboue all
other. Likewise the straunge knight dyd not so little féele
the great force of the knight of the Sun, but that he thought
it impossible to cleere himselfe well of that battaile, but hée
as one that little estéemed his life, for to reuenge some parte
of the great anger which he had against his aduersary, did so
inforce and animate himselfe, that the battaile endured thrée
houres betwixt them, without anie knowledge of vauntage
<pb facs="tcp:13995:50"/>
of the one part or of the other. The blowes which they
stroke were of so great force and strength, that many times
it dyd astonish and amaze them, and brought them so farre
out of remembraunce, that their horses carried them round
about the place, and all those that dyd beholde that stoute
and rigorous battaile, were greatlie amazed, and iudged it
to bee equall vnto that combat which before hee had with
<hi>Rosicleer</hi> his Brother. Likewise the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi>
and all those high Princes and knightes that were with
him, dyd not a little meruaile at the great bountie of that
straunge knight, saying that hée shewed himselfe to bée
one of the valiauntest knightes that was to bée found in
all the worlde, for that hée had so long sustained battayle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the knight of the Sunne: and <hi>Rosicleer</hi> who was
at a windowe next vnto the Emperour his Father, with
the Princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> with greate admiration dyd beholde
the battaile, (and as one that had well experimented the
strength and force of his brother,) dyd greatlie prayse the
straunge knight, for that he dyd so we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

blowes.</p>
               <p>So when <hi>Rosicleer</hi> had sayde these wordes, it was not
long after that it fell out true as hée had sayde, for beeing
more than foure houres since the beginning of the battaile,
at such time as the Sunne woulde sette, the knight of the
Sunne seeing that the daie woulde passe awaie, in such sort
hée beganne to rage and burne with ire, that séemed vnto
his aduersarie, that his force dyd ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that hée beganne the battayle a freshe, for that his blowes
were such and so thicke, that manye times it made him to
loose his remembraunce, so that at that time the battaile
was more terrible and cruell than it was all the daie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
yet neuerthelesse the straunge knight was such, that
hée abated not one pointe of his mightie and soueraigne

force, but with renued strength hée so charged the knight
of the Sunne, that many times hée was without all hope of

               <p>In this sorte the battayle remained in ballaunce almost

night beganne to appeare, then the straunge knight began
to ware wearie, and little and little his strength did abate,
in such sort, that it was well seene that he had not the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
that hee had at the first, for that hée lift vppe his armes
with great paine, and his swoorde turned in his hande: the
which was cleane contrarie to the knight of the Sunne, who
at that present was more stout and couragious than at the
beginning, and in such sorte dyd laye vppon his aduersarie,
that as one amazed, he chased him rounde about the place,
(but hée séeing that the vauntage of that combat was on
his parte, and how the straunge knight was the best knight
that euer hée met withall, next vnto his Brother <hi>Rosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer)</hi>
hée withdrewe himselfe and lefte off his striking, in
such sorte, that the straunge knight might take ayre and
breath himselfe, which was the occasion that after he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto the battayle, he shewed himselfe so valyaunt and
strong, that it séemed the daye woulde cleane passe awaie
before the battayle woulde bée ended, if they had let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
but <hi>Medea</hi> who was meruailouslie in loue with the
straunge knight, as shée was beholding this braue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle
all daie, thought it impossible for her knight to haue
there anie victorie, and béeing verie desirous to part them,
shée went vnto the Emperour, and requested him, for that
the night <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yd approch, for to commaunde that the knightes
shoulde cease their battayle, for that they hadde the next day
following at their commandement, for to conclude the same.
Then the Emperour who esteemed much of the straunge
knight, with great desire that the battaile might not come to
conclusion, for feare of euil, withdrew himself from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and descended into the great Court, whereas he moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vpon a mightie horse, &amp; being accompanied with all those
<pb facs="tcp:13995:51"/>
high Princes and knights, he went vnto the place whereas
those knightes made their combat, and putting himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
them, he sayd.</p>
               <p>Worthie and valiant knightes, I doe most heartelie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

her selfe in the middest of them, and sayde: Héere openlie I
doe professe and saie, that I hold my selfe verie well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

So when the Emperour and <hi>Medea</hi> had sayde these

to obey their commandement, and not to contend for the end

Emperour in the midst betwixt them, &amp; also heard the words
which <hi>Medea</hi> had spoken, séeing that it could be no otherwise,
also withdrew himselfe, although it was with great sorrow,
anger, &amp; griefe, for that he had rather haue ben slaine in that
battaile, than to escape with life. So when that their battell
was separated, the knight of the Sunne went vnto the
strange knight, with determination to be his friend, and to
knowe him, and being verie nigh vnto him readie for to

such-blow that should cause him so much griefe, requesting
to comfort themselues, for that that traunce would soone
passe away, if that they would let him alone and suffer him
to take his rest. So when the doctors had said these words,
the Emperour and all the rest were very glad, and hauing

out of order and angrie, that it grieued him nothing to heare
him saie so, &amp; therefore he said: Tell mée who thou art, and
what is the occasion that thou wilt kil him, for that I am he

and if thou doest tell mée this which I doe aske thée, I wil
tell thée where thou shalt finde this knight of the Sunne,

Then <hi>Brandimardo</hi> (sayde hée) thou shalt vnderstand that I
am this knight of the Sunne whome thou doest seeke, and
truth it is that I slew <hi>Affricano</hi> in a valiant battael that we

and many other thinges passed betwéene these two good
and perfect friendes, till such times as with many teares
they tooke their leaue the one of the other. So after that the
king <hi>Sacridoro</hi> had taken his leaue of the Emperour, the
Empresse, and of all the rest of his friends, hée departed out
of the mightie Citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and comming to the
sea side, he dyd embarke himselfe in a good shippe, and made
saile towards the kingdome of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> and <hi>Rosicleer</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in great solitarinesse for lacke of his companie, for
that the loue which hée bare vnto him was verie greate,
who séeing how much it did touch him, that which shoulde
happen, although his father the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> with
great diligence did vnderstand in the prouiding of all things
necessarie. He likewise on the other part did all that euer he
could for to ioyne together the armie, and in writing vnto
his friends, giuing them to vnderstand of the great néede
that he had of them. But the absence of the knight of the
Sunne was vnto him verie grieuous, for that he would not
that at that time he should bée absent from the Court, and
for to tel you what passed with him, the Hystorie doth leaue
the other till time.</p>

that time, his force and strength, as also the bignesse of his
<pb facs="tcp:13995:63"/>
members did dailie increase. So hauing verie good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
by the knightes that were in the shippe, one of
them asked him of whence hée was, and he sayde, that hée
was of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and for that he sayde no more vnto them,
there was not one of them that asked him anie other questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
although it séemed vnto them by his semblance, that there
was some thing that did trouble and grieue him verie much
hée was so heauie. Thus they trauailed two daies together
with prosperous windes, passing awaie the time in the best
manner hée could, but the third daie there arose a greate
torment in so terrible sorte, that the shippe wherein they
were was in great perill to bée lost. The windes dyd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
euerie moment more and more, in such furious sort,
that all the cunning of the mariners did not serue for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of the ship, but were driuen of necessitie for to
yéelde her vnto the curtesie of the winde and seas, driuing
wheresoeuer it pleased them. In this sort were they tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and tossed with that tempest all that daie and the night
following, without anie semblaunce of calmenesse, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
euerie minute for to bée cast awaie, which put greate
feare amongest them all, sauing vnto the knight of the Sun,
who séeing the Sea so troubled, and the mightie waues cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by those terrible windes, fighting one with another, he
was not alonelie without all feare, but also dyd lyke well
thereof, and it was agréeable vnto his minde, as vnto one
that was wearie of his owne lyfe, but the next daie follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
at such time as they were without all hope to escape
that danger, fortune dyd so serue them, that the storme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to asswage, in such sorte, that the Mariners might
gouerne their shippe, but they found that they were put a
great waie leward from the place whether as they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to goe, and sailing forwards on their iourney, they
discouered a farre off an Iland, and out of the middest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they might perceiue ascend vp into the aire at times, great
flames and sparkes of fire, with a terrible darke and thicke
smoake, as though they hadde béene burning of some drie
things. And when they came nigh vnto the same Ilande,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13995:63"/>
the knights were all desirous to goe there a land, for to ease
and refresh themselues for that they were out of quiet with
the storme passed, but the Marriners knowing the Iland,
haled iackes aboord, and ran of from the land all that euer
they could, crying out &amp; saying, they would not go thether,
for that it was the Iland of the diuell, called the solitarie I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and how that if they went thether they should all die
the death.</p>
               <p>When the knights of <hi>Candia</hi> heard these wordes, they
were all greatlie amazed, for they hadde heard before time
verie much of that Iland. But the knight of the Sun who
was inclined by his valiant heart to attempt high &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
things, with great desire for to sée what it was that they
so greatlie feared, he asked of the Mariners wherefore they
called that the Iland of the Diuell, and why they feared so
much the death if they should go thether? And although all
the knights that were there present had heard verie much of
the great perill and daunger of that Iland, yet there was
none that could declare the certaintie thereof, but an olde
Pilot that came as passenger in the same shippe, who had
heard the whole truth thereof by certaine men which lefte
the sayd Iland in respect of the great daunger, and he séeing
that the knight of the Sunne had great desire to knowe the
mysterie therof, in the presence of all the knights that were
there present, began to declare the same as followeth.</p>
               <p>YOu shall vnderstand (gentle Knight) that this Ilande
was called in times past, the Ilande of <hi>Artimaga,</hi> for
that it was gouerned by a woman so called, who was
so abhominable and euill, that neuer the lyke was séene
nor heard of amongst women, for that after she came vnto
the age of fiftéene yéeres vntill the time of her death, which
was more than thirtie yéeres, shée neuer beléeued in God
but in the diuell, and there was no daie that passed ouer
her head, but she sawe the diuell in the figure of a man, and
had talke and conuersation with her, as though he had bene
her husband, and she did euerie daie twice humble her selfe
<pb facs="tcp:13995:64"/>
vnto him and did worship him. The father and mother of
this <hi>Artimaga</hi> were verie euill and peruerse, &amp; being Lords
and gouernours of this Iland at their death, they left this
<hi>Artimaga</hi> of the age of ten yéeres, little more or lesse, and for
that there was no heire male at their decease, she was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
accepted for Ladie and gouernesse of the whole Iland,
who when she sawe that she was absolute of her selfe, and
all in her disposition, she gaue her selfe so much vnto all the

                  </gap>es of this worlde, that for her abhominable
sinnes and wickednesse, God dyd permit that when this
<hi>Artimaga</hi> came vnto the age of fiftéene yéeres, shée was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
with the diuell, and would neuer consent vnto mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
for that shée would not submit her selfe vnder the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of her husband, but yet she had more than thirtie
gallants at her commaundement, and had a great delight to
chaunge euerie yéere so many more, and with the greate
conuersation that she had continuallie with the diuell, she
came to bée so wise and cunning in the art Magicke, that
there was none in all her time, although hée were neuer so
cunning, that might bee compared vnto her. Shée vsed so
many and diuerse sortes of inchauntmentes, that all those
of the Iland dyd feare her verie much, and although her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable
and horrible li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e séemed verie euill vnto them
all, yet durst they doe no other thing, but to obey her for
their Ladie and gouernesse. It so fell out that this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
woman was neuer brought to bedde, nor neuer was
with childe, although (in consideration thereof many times
shée woulde not for the space of two or thrée moneths to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vse the companie but onelie of one man, for the
which shée receiued great sorrowe and griefe at her verye
heart, in séeing that shée coulde not haue anie issue of her
bodie that might succéede her in the Lordshippe of that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,
and many times when shée was in companie with
the Diuell, shee dyd complayne verie much thereof, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him earnestlie with greate deuotion to doe so much for
her, that she might haue a sonne, with whom she might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
her selfe, and put some remedie vnto the great sorrowe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13995:64"/>
which she receiued at her heart, for lacke thereof. Then the
deceitfull diuell, full of pollicie, &amp; enimie vnto all humaine
generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing great desire to bring vnto ende that euill
fortuned woman, the more surer to make his pray vpon her
soule, bethought himselfe of a meruailous eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll, and sayde,
that vnto that time he would not consent that she should
haue any generation, in consideration that she loued him so
wel, he wold not that she should conceiue by anie humaine
creature, but onelie by him, and that he determined to lye
with her, certifying that she should fullie persuade her selfe
that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sonne that should be borne of her, should be the most
strongest that should be found in all the world, and in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of her loue, that Iland should be spoken of in all the
world.</p>
               <p>These words of the diuell, caused so great ioye and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in <hi>Artimaga,</hi> that as one from her selfe she fell downe
prostrate at his féete and kissed them, for that great benefit
offered vnto her, and with great importuna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie she desired
him straight way to put it in vre. Then the diuell hauing
no other determination but onely to deceiue her, saide: thou
shalt vnderstande <hi>Artimaga</hi> that there is not giuen vnto
mée so much power, for to know thee nor no humaine wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
in the forme of a rationall man, but in some other fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
and forme of a wilde beast that is furious and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull,
the which is onely for to shew the difference that is
betwixt our great power, and that of men. And againe, that
which shalbe begotten by mee, to be of much more force and
strength.</p>
               <p>When that <hi>Artimaga</hi> heard him say these wordes, with
the great ioye which she receiued, she was voide of all care,
and saide vnto him, that she should receiue great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and pleasure therein, although he came in the most
vgliest and fearefullest forme that might be.</p>
               <p>So the diuell fell at agréement with her, that vpon a
certaine day she should goe into a Parke that was in that
Ilande, being full of meruailous great and thicke trées,
(whereas she did manie times goe a hunting) and that he
<pb facs="tcp:13995:65"/>
would there tarrie her comming. Then the diuell for to
accomplish and bring to passe that which he had promised,
went vnto the desarts of <hi>Affrica,</hi> &amp; out from the most high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and aspar parts of all the mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> he brought forth
a monstrous beast called <hi>Fauno,</hi> the most terriblest amongst
all beasts, and they saie that by reason of the great abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
vsed in times past by men, hauing copulation with
monstrous beastes, did so alter humane nature, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of time it concluded in this so terrible and monstrous
beast, the fashion and forme thereof was as I will declare
vnto you: His bodie was as bigge as a great bull, in forme
and shape lyke a Lion, with his féete full of rugged haire,
and the clawes of his féete as bigge as twice a mans finger,
and a span long, his breast as big as of a horse, and necked
like an Elephant, and from that part vpward both head and
face like a man, with a long beard of hard and thicke haire,
but the head was verie bigge, and out of the middest of his
forehead came forth an horne as big as a mans arme and as
long, whose force was such, as also in his armes, that there
was no beast so furious and fierce, that was able to indure
before him. Almightie God shewed great fauour vnto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
for that of these beastes there are but a few in the
world, and they are not to be found but on the highest parts
of the mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> which is all desert and no inhabitation,
for if they were whereas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>here is people, one of these beasts
alone were sufficient for to destroie a whole kingdome. So
the diuel finding out this monstrous beast, he entered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, and brought him vnto this Iland, and tarried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Parke till the comming of <hi>Artimaga</hi> at the houre
appointed, who with the greate desire that she had to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
by the diuel, detracted no time, but kept her houre, and
although she had great astonishment at the fiercenesse and
terrible semblance of that monster, yet for all that it did not
abate her courage, beléeuing of a certaintie that it was the
diuell, and for that the diuell was within the monster, hée
spake by the mouth of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>Fauno</hi> all that was requisite. To
conclude, he deceiued <hi>Artimaga,</hi> and by the permission of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13995:65"/>
God, for her sinnes and abhominable desire, she was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by that diuellish <hi>Fauno,</hi> in such sort, that she remayned
with child. Then she returned againe vnto her house, and
the diuell carried the monster vnto the place from whence
he brought him, and in the end of thrée moneths she felt her
selfe with child, for the which she receiued so great ioy and
contentment as euer she did in all her life, beleeuing of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
that the sonne that shoulde be borne of her, shoulde
bée the most strongest and mightiest in all the world, and
neuer ceased giuing thankes vnto the diuell, for that he was
the author and father thereof. But in consideration that his
originall is euill, and hath no other desire nor delight but
to deceiue all humane generation: euen so all his workes
and déedes cannot be but euill, and in great daunger &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
vnto our soules. So the time was expired &amp; the houre
come that <hi>Artimaga</hi> should be deliuered, and she was so big,
broade, and swelled, that she could not moue her selfe from
one place vnto another, in such sort, that all that dyd sée her
were greatlie amazed, for that shée séemed to be foure times
so bigge as she was before, and by reason that the fruit of
her cohabitation was deformed, monstrous, and diuellish,
they had no hope of anie naturall birth by ordinarie course,
but rent and tore the bellie and entrailes of the mother,
wherewith shée dyed and yéelded her soule vnto him whom
shée so much beléeued and worshipped, and the childe came
forth, the most horriblest and terriblest creature that euer
nature formed. This childe was scarce out of his mothers
wombe, when that with a diuellish furie he tore in péeces
all that euer were before him, and ran out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

woode wheras he was begotten, and there he remained cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
dayes, and neuer came forth till hée was growen to a
bigger stature, although then when he was borne, he was
as bigge as reasonable Lion. He had not remained full halfe

to be as bigge as an Elephant, his forme and figure

was much more horrible than that of his father, although he
did resemble him verie much, and besides all this, he had a
whole legion of diuels within his bodie, who in a figure of
armed men, many times came forth at his horrible mouth,
and did great harme whereas they went, so that for this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
he is called the diuellish or possessed <hi>Fauno.</hi> So after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
when that he was come vnto his full strength, which
was within halfe a yéere, he left the woods, &amp; went through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the Iland, &amp; did so much harme, that he left none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue
where he became, some slaine, and other some hearing
the report of his crueltie, fled awaie, so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Iland is lefte

nigh it with their ships, for that many times this possessed
<hi>Fauno</hi> hath ben séene enter into the sea a great stones cast,
when that anie ship or barke were nigh the shore, and if that
by misfortune those vnhappie trauailers doe fall into his
hands, there is none that escapeth with their lius, for that
with the horne that he hath in his forehead, at one only blow
he teareth a ship in péeces, then after with his strong armes
and vnmercifull téeth he rents &amp; teares in péeces all that is
before him, and there is no strength of man, nor armour so
strong, that can withstand his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

much spoken of, and so feareful vnto all sailers that passeth
this waie, and why it is called the Iland of the diuell, and
that fire which we doe sée, with that thicke smoake that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth
into the aire, is all that which procéedeth out of the
terrible and horrible mouth of that diuellish <hi>Fauno,</hi> for that
it is full of infernall diuells. By this you may iudge what
the monster should be, that throweth from him such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
and terrible infections.</p>
               <p>This worthie knight of the Sun at this discourse of the
olde Pilot was greatly amazed, and so were all the knights
of <hi>Candia</hi> that came in the same ship, the which thing seemed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13995:66"/>
vnto them to be one of the straungest that euer happened in
all the world, yet the straungenesse thereof was not so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
vnto all the rest of the hearers, as it gaue great desire
vnto the valiant &amp; worthie knight of the Sun to go a land
at that Iland, and to goe and seeke out that possessed <hi>Fauno,</hi>
for that the hearing thereof did not cause anie feare or dread
in his couragious heart, as he who for such like attempts (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other stout knights) was created, &amp; did litle estéeme
the venturing of his life, whereas the honour and glorie of
such worthinesse is put in aduenture, and in especiall in that
time abhorring himselfe in consideration of his fact, he was
so furious and desperate, that he neither feared nor dreaded
the entrie into hell, much lesse the Iland. Thus he béeing
fullie determined to goe a land, called vnto him <hi>Aurelio</hi>
and <hi>Biniano</hi> his squires, and calling them apart, in shedding
many salt teares which ranne down his graue countenance,
he sayd these wordes.</p>
               <p>My good friends, God doth know what great griefe it is
vnto me for to declare this which I haue to saie, and what
sorrow I doe féele at my heart before I doe vtter it, not so
much for that it doth touch me (although my misfortune a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
al other in the world is most strangest) as it is for that
I doe sée, at such time as I should doe some thing for you, &amp;
to giue you reward for your great good seruice done vnto
me, I am constrained to abandon and leaue you alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any hope euer to sée you more, this is the thing that doth
so grieue me, ioyntlie to consider how my losse will bée la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
of my father and mother, my brother, and all my
friends, that to declare it my tongue doth faile mee. Ah my
good friends, you shall vnderstand that my departure out
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was for no other intent but for to leaue
the worlde, and for to goe whereas I might shorten my
daies, and thether whereas it might not bée knowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
anie whether I be aliue or dead, for that my euill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
is such, that it doeth not atcomplish mée for to liue
anie longer héere amongest men, and in consideration
heereof (I dyd at our departure) so much request you that
<pb facs="tcp:13995:67"/>
you should haue remained with the Emperour my Father,
for that he and my brother <hi>Rosicleer</hi> might reward you for
the great seruice done vnto me, for that I am not able to
doe it, and being at that time so much importuned by you,
that by anie meanes I could not leaue your companie, but
now the time is come that my sorrowfull destinie hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
that from this daie forwardes I am constrained to
leaue you, and to make reckoning that of you nor of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and brother I was neuer knowen. The occasion therof
I will not declare vnto you, for that alonelie my hart (who
doth suffer the inconuenience) shal know it. But thus much
I will saie vnto you, that if the perill in loosing of my soule
did not disturbe me, I haue sufficient cause to giue my selfe
a thousand deaths with my owne handes, and for that my
life is so heauie and grieuous vnto mée, and that my force &amp;
strength is not sufficient for to suffer the same, I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
for to go a land on this Iland of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>Fauno,</hi> and there
to end my vnhappie daies, and if it so fall out, fortune to be
fauourable vnto me, in that I do ouercome and kil the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
I shall doe great seruice vnto God, in taking out of the
world a thing so fierce and abhominable, then afterwarde
shall that Iland be verie solitarie and fit for my purpose,
where I meane to end my sorrowfull daies. And if my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
be such that I die in the power of the <hi>Fauno,</hi> (as sure
I am that I owe a death) then shall I there paie the death
that is due vnto this my mortall bodie, and the debt that
is due vnto this vnhappie and troublesome world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my good friends, I doe most heartelie desire you, for the
great good loue which you dyd alwaies beare vnto me, that
at this present you will shew it to be more than héeretofore,
and to be conformable vnto my will, and to thinke well of
this my pretence, and to haue patience, and perswade with
your selues in this my departure, and to comfort your selues
in that it is a great griefe vnto me for to leaue you, and to
conclude, the lyfe of man is briefe and short, and full of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie
and anguish, and I praie and beséech the vniuersall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
that we may in the other world with more ioy, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesse,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13995:67"/>
and pleasure. So my will is, that after I am
departed, you go with these knights vnto <hi>Transiluania,</hi> and
from thence to returne into <hi>Grecia,</hi> and there to establysh
your selues with the Emperour my father, without giuing
him to vnderstand of anie thing that hath happened vnto
me, since my departure out of the mightie Citie of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
but saie that you lost me in the wildernesse of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
and remaine with him, for that I am sure that hée and
my brother <hi>Rosicleer</hi> will doe as much for you, as though
I were there my selfe: and if at anie time by fortune you
doe méete with the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> you shall saye
vnto her, that at such time as I departed from you, I left
your companie, for that I went out of the worlde, because
that in liuing I shoulde not bée odious vnto her, nor cause
her anie more anger, and of one thing she shall bée sure, that
so long as shée liueth, shée shall neuer haue anie newes
of mée.</p>
               <p>When the knight of the Sunne had sayd these wordes,
these two his good Squires did weepe so bitterlie, that they
had no power to speak in a good space, in the end they caught
him by the armour, and held him fast, saying: Oh our good
Lord, wherefore is it you pleasure for to leaue vs in so great
sorrow and care, and to cause your father and mother, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and friendes, alwaies to liue in great heauinesse and
griefe. What great griefe is this that you haue conceiued,
which is the occasion that you doe desire the death? What
greater euill may happen vnto the world, than to haue the
lacke, &amp; sustaine the losse of such a knight as thou art? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
our good Lord, that if you doe performe this which you
saie you will, you doe not alonelie loose your life, but also
your soule, for in conclusion, it is a desperate death. For the
loue of God (our good Lord) let not such things passe once
into your thought, for that no man in all the world can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
a thing of a worser determination, and héerein you
shall also loose both bodie and soule, and shall be the occasion
of the death of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> your father, and of
the Empresse <hi>Briana</hi> your mother, for as they doe loue you
<pb facs="tcp:13995:68"/>
more than themselues, they will die with verie anger and
griefe, when they shall heare of your perdition, &amp; vnto none
it wil be so griouous as vnto the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> who
is the occasion of all this your sorrow. What shall we doe
(vnhappie as we are) when that wée shall finde our selues
all alone without your companie? How can we returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Grecia,</hi> when that the subiects doth lacke their so great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
estéemed Prince? With what semblance or countenance can
we come in the presence of your Father, not daring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the losse and death of his sonne? Ought not we great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to be sorrowfull to thinke how our hearts must be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that when your brother and friends shall demaund
of newes of you, and we knowing the conclusion, dare not
be so hardie as to vtter it? What is he that can suffer so
great griefe, or dissemble so great sorrow? God forbid that
euer anie such thing shoulde bée permitted, wée will first
consent to bée drowned in this déep sea, than to returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Grecia</hi> without your companie. And if you doe still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to goe a land on that Iland of the diuellish <hi>Fauno,</hi> we
will goe with you and beare you companie, for that wée
shall thinke our deaths happie to loose them with yours, and
had rather ioyntly to die with you, than to liue one moment
in this worlde for to lament and feele the griefe of your
death.</p>
               <p>These and many other thinges in effect, sayd these good
Squires, shedding many salt teares for to withdrawe their
Lord the knight of the Sunne from his determination, but
all did profit nothing (for although it was great anguish and
mortall griefe vnto him for to depart from them) yet was
he so firme in his determination to accomplish that which
he had said, that if all the whole world had bene there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
for to disswade him, yet had they not ben sufficient for
to withdrawe him from the doing thereof. And therewithall
he requested the Mariners to launch out their skiffe on the
water. But when the Mariners and all those knightes of
<hi>Candia</hi> did vnderstand his determination, and sawe how
pitti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ullie his Squires did wéepe for him, they were greatly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13995:68"/>
amazed thereat, and thought him to be a desperate knight,
and one that was wearie of his life, that wold giue attempt
to so strange aduenture, hauing heard the wonderfull thing
that the olde Pilot had tolde them of that Iland, who bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there present, &amp; saw with what determination, he wold
goe vnto the Iland, and with what efficacie he dyd demand
the skiffe for to goe a land, before them all hée sayde these
wordes.</p>
               <p>I greatlie meruaile at you (Sir knight) hauing heard
the wonderfull things that I haue tolde vnto you of this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of the diuell, and yet you haue so great will to go the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
of truth I cannot iudge that it doth procéede of anie
strength or couragious heart, but of some desperation that
you haue with you, whereby you doe abhorre your owne
life, for that stout and couragious Barons doe neuer put
their liues in aduenture, but whereas they haue hope to get
honour and victorie, but that man which doth put himselfe
there wheras he doth aduenture no other honour, but to die
the death, it may be wel said y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it is more of desperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than
of force or courage. What account doe you make of your
owne strength? I saie, if it be equall with that of <hi>Hercules,</hi>
&amp; that of <hi>Thebano,</hi> yet were it not sufficient to escape from
the hands of that possessed <hi>Fauno,</hi> if once you goe a land, and
it is well knowen that all the people of the Iland coulde
not make anie defence against him, although there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more than thrée thousand knights, besides other
common people verie stout and clubbish, and yet will you
take vpon you alone the enterprise, surelie it is a plaine
thing to vnderstand, that you will kill your selfe, for that
you will put your selfe in that aduenture, whereas it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to saue your life, the which is a thing most abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before God, and this proceedeth onelie of the lacke of
wisedome, weaknesse, and want of patience, and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
each one where wisedome remaineth with equal hart
and valiant courage doth suffer all humane troubles, &amp; not
for euerie little trouble, doth straight waies abhorre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and so from a little euill fall into another far greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13995:69"/>
What other thing haue you in al this world that maketh
a man more to abhore and hate himselfe and his owne life
than afflictions and troubles? And it is manifest vnto vs, as
it is spoken by the wise, that troubles appertaineth onelie
vnto men. Likewise that holie and afflicted <hi>Iob</hi> saith, that
for trauailes and troubles man was borne, but those which
haue no patience nor strength for to suffer aduersities, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
(that al things that doth not fal out according vnto their
desire and appetite) that they haue iust occasion to desire and
procure the death, and vpon the sodaine they are in such a
rage, that for euerie light thing they doe not onelie anger
themselues against fortune, but also against themselues, and
that which is worst of all, they are out of patience with God
that dyd create them, vsing against him wordes of greate
abhomination, as though that if God did not all things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their willes, then doth he them great iniurie, but vnto
them that bée wise, what state so euer God doth send them,
they accept it in good part, if it bée with prosperitie and ioy
they accept it with a good will, and if it bée sadde and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull,
they suffer it with suffer it with patience, and when that with
the occasions they cannot bée merrie, then doe they comfort
themselues with patience, for that there is nothing so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
and pleasant as is patience: therewith heauie and
sorrowfull heartes are made glad and ioyfull, wronges are
brought to perfection, it mollifieth hard hearts, &amp; do mitigate
difficultnesse, aspar things it maketh plaine, and ceaseth all
quarrels and sodaine motions, and finallie there is nothing
of more quietnes and comfort than is the life of the patient.
These wéepinges, these complaintes, these clowdes and
stormes, that causeth the weake barke of our humane lyfe
to bée dashed and broken in péeces against the rockes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth
of no other thing but of the follie and impatience of
men. So that (gentle Knight) if you dyd suffer with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the troubles and afflictions of this life (considering
that in the end there cannot bée found a thing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
amongst men) then shoulde no peruerse fortune, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

onelie the compassion? Doe not abridge God of that work,
whereas he did not onelie create the flesh, but also bones,
bloud, and spirit. And it séemeth vnto me (as it is most true)
that there is no other Lord ouer celestiall and terrestriall
things, but he that made all things? Well then, séeing that

that it is determined not onelie the daie but the houre of thy

he tooke the boate in both his hands, and without the helpe

his leaue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, but his squires when they saw that
he would depart, they gaue such shrickes and cries, that it
séemed the noyse to reach vnto the heauens, and fell downe

to behold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, desiring him that he would not leaue
them in so great heauinesse, and for that it was so manifest
that he went to loose his life, that he would take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his

knight was such, for his two squires, that with the great
aboundance of teares that fell from his eyes, he could scant
speake vnto them one worde: especiallie, considering with
what intencion he departed, which was neuer to sée them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine

for that he was determined if God did giue him victorie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Fauno,</hi> to remaine in that solitarie Ilande, and
there to ende his daies: But for that he loued his squires
verie well, and likewise knowing the great loue that they
bare vnto him, his heart was readie to burst in péeces for
to apart himselfe from them. Likewise all those knights of
<hi>Candia,</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde pilot, did labour all that euer they could,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13995:73"/>
for to breake him of his purpose, but all would not serue,
and he séeing that his tarrying did him no profit, he went
vnto the shippes side, and with a light heart he leapt into
the boate, and taking the oares in his handes, he began to
rowe towards the Ilande, leauing so great sorow &amp; griefe
amongst all them that were in the shippe, that there was
not one of them but wept bitterlie to see him depart in that
sorte, as one desperate to receiue a cruell death, and being
a knight that seemed vnto them all not to haue his lyke in
all the world, yet all the griefe which they receiued, was
nothing vnto that of his squires, when they sawe their
lorde depart, who like desperate men would haue throwne
themselues into the sea, if those knights had not lette them,
and seemed vnto them to be true and loyal vnto their lord,
and of a good disposition, so with the great care that they
had of them, they did kéepe them from destroying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues.</p>
               <p>After this good knight was departed, within a shorte
space he ariued at the Iland, and those of the ship lost sight
of him: but there were some of the shippe that saide that it
were good to tarrie ther a few daies, for to sée what should
become of him, to whome the pilot saide, that it was great
follie so to doe, for two causes, the one for that he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
so soone as the knight should come a land with a trice
he should be torne all to péeces by that diuelish <hi>Fauno,</hi> so
that it were lost labour to abyde anie more newes of him,
and the other, for that all they should be in great perill of
their liues, if that the <hi>Fauno</hi> should discouer the shippe, and
before that we could doe anie thing for to saile from him,
he would ouertake vs, and giue vs all cruell deathes, as he
hath done to manie others heretofore. In conclusion, at these

               <p>These and many other things spake this good knight, in
shedding so many teares, and vttering so many sighes, that
whosoeuer had heard them (although his heart had bene so
hard as anie Diamond) yet could he not haue refrained but

to goe toward that diuellish <hi>Fauno,</hi> he bethought himselfe
how and in what sort he might make battaile with him, and
it it séemed that if fortune shuld shew her selfe in anie thing
fauourable vnto him, it should be to make the battaile better
on foot than on horsebacke, &amp; now according vnto his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
whether he did liue or die, he had no more néede of

&amp; go at his frée liberty, in recompence of his good seruice done

               <p>In saying these words he draue him from him for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte,
but it was great meruaile to sée the nature of this

               <p>God forbidde that the sword wherewith I did strike so
high and soueraigne a Ladie, should now be defiled in the
bloud of so foule &amp; infernall a monster. And in saying these
wordes, with great furie and force he laide holde with both
his handes vpon a great and knotted branch of one of those
Okes, and tore it from the bodie of the trée, and trimming it
in the best manner he could, he laid it vpon his shoulder, the
which was so great and heauie, that many other knightes
should lacke strength to lift it vp from the ground. And as he
trauailed in this sort, he thought within himselfe, that if hée
should be slaine in that battaile, that then his good swoorde
should remaine in the fielde, and then afterward it might
so fall out, that in time that Iland might againe bée peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,

come to the hand of some knight, wherewith he might shed
the bloud of others, and for that he would not doe so greate

profit himselfe therewith. Then considering how &amp; in what
manner he might execute his determination to breake th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, although it were farre bigger, and of very hard stone,

that it séemed to burne with the great quantitie of fire that
flew out thereof, but by reason of his great goodnesse, for
that it was one of the best that was to be found in all the
world, all the strength that he had, neither the hardnesse of
the rocke was sufficient to breake it, it was the sword the
which he had of the Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> whereat this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
Prince was in so great furie and wrath, that with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
strength he assaulted againe the rocke, and in a short
space he did cut and breake it all to péeces, and the swoorde

neuer the worse. (In this, saith the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo,</hi> that

all that euer he could doe was not sufficient to breake that
sword (although he made it many times to double &amp; bow the
point vnto the hilt) he determined to leaue it there, and for
that afterward it shuld be the better estéemed of him whose

to be grapled vnto those two, where by she might be fullie

knight of a verie bigge bodie and well armed, and in his

that came in one of the two shippes, and by force made

knight (who séemed to be the chiefest amongst them) what
should be the occasion of that their great lamentation, he
straight waies came against her, putting him to the shippes

<hi>Cleonidas,</hi> which was in the time of king <hi>Tolomeo,</hi> who
did take the king, and commaunded him to be glystred or
boxed with bagges of scalding oyle, for that he dyd the lyke
vnto all such as he dyd take. This was called the second
<hi>Cleonidas,</hi> he continued more then fiftene yéeres vpon the
Seas, and neuer went a land, but tooke and robbed all that
euer he met with all, and vsed no other office but as afore is
declared. He went not alone with one shippe as he was
at that present, but alwaies had with him more then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that were verie good, and fortified with all necessaries

scattered abroade, and seperated the one from the other into

drawing out her sword, she sayde these words following.</p>

with a cruell and desperate death he receiued his paiment a

I doe beleeue, <hi>Cleonidas,</hi> that thou in all thy actions,
being so conformable, that the Iustice which happened vnto
them, cannot be lacking vnto thée. Consider from whence
thou commest, and what thou hast bene, and then I hope in
God that thou wilt leaue of to be a rouer, or else thou wilt
goe to receiue the reward of all the harmes which thou hast
done in this world, vnto the diuel of hell, who is author and

these words, he drew out his swoord, &amp; went against <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana,</hi>
then there began betwéene them a very fierce &amp; cruel
battaile, &amp; they layed the one vpon the other such strong &amp;
heauie blowes, that in short space their shields were hewed
&amp; broken in péeces, &amp; all those that beheld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were greatly
amazed, at their great force &amp; stoutnesse, and it séemed vnto
them that they were two of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> brauest &amp; strongest knights
that euer before they had séene. This battaile was so rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
that in a short space <hi>Cleonides</hi> began to féele &amp; know
the high bountie of his aduersarie, as he that neuer in all his
life, met with anie that did charge him so strongly, neither
brought him into the like extremitie, and the more he stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
against her, the more he felte the waight and furie of
her blowes.</p>
               <p>This battaile endured betwixte them more then a whole

The Empresse receiued them verie curteouslie, and asked
of them who they were, and of what Countrie? Wherevnto
the damsell answered, saying.</p>
               <p>You shall vnderstand (worthie knight) that this Knight
and I are both of the confines of <hi>Sarmasia,</hi> and I am Ladie
ouer sixe Castles of mine owne the which be verie strong
and good, all scituated in one great and fresh valley, and this
knight is Lord ouer other thrée Castles, round about mine,
and being ouercome with my beautie, fell in loue with mée,
and would haue taken me for his wife, I liked wel of him,
but there was one thing that did disturbe me, and hindered
the accomplishing of his desire, which was, that I had some
suspition that he bare great good wil and loue vnto a Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
that is verie faire, and Ladie ouer another little valley,
which is verie faire and pleasant, and till such time as I
was fullie certefied of this doubt, I wold neuer consent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

There was a conclusion conserted betwixt vs both, that we
should goe together into the kingdome of <hi>Rusia,</hi> vnto the

of all heartes, and what they doe desire, although they
doe dissemble and kéepe it neuer so secret. So this séeming
vnto vs the best remedie, wée straight waies gaue order for

béeing by fortune put into this port, our mishappe woulde
that wée shoulde méete with this rouer <hi>Cleonidas,</hi> who
straight waies with his knights dyd ioyne in battaile with
vs, and hauing slaine the most part of those that came with
vs, this knight béeing so sore oppressed with them, in the

came with mée, according as you Sir knight, dyd finde vs.
This is all that I can declare for aunswere vnto your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,

               <p>The Empresse <hi>Claridiana</hi> reioyced verie much at the good
discourse of the damsell, and meruailed not a little of that
which she heard told of the caue of <hi>Artidon,</hi> and as one that
desired no other thing, to the intent she might bée fullie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefied
of her knight, shée requested the Ladie once agayne
to certefie her of that caue, and to giue her to vnderstande,
what is the reason that they that entered in shoulde knowe
all that they demaunded. Then <hi>Elisea,</hi> (for so the Damsell
was called) who knew verie well the whole aduenture of
that caue, declared it vnto her peticularlie in such order as
it was and passed, saying that the sayde <hi>Artidon</hi> was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wisest that was in all his time, and hetherto could neuer bée

commanded the marriners, that they should with all sailes

               <p>Thus by force hasting to the shoreward, launching out

and there were so great a number of them and their barkes

they could get a shore, who when they found themselues
vpon the firme lande, &amp; against them a number of Gréekes
that dyd disturbe their disembarking, they did in suche
sort beginne to besturre themselues amongst them, that in
a shorte time with their wonderfull and terrible blowes,
they dyd so intreate them, that of very force they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to retire, for that they neuer stroke blow, but that
they slew or ouerthrew a knight to the ground, that by their
mightie force, they had place for to dise<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>barke the rest a land.
And in this sort being a foote as they were, they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
into the middest of the battaile, by whose comming,
many Gréekes lost their liues, and they carryed the flower
of the victorie, for that whereas they went, there was not

lost a great parte of the field, and retyred themselues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

they did incourage and animate them all that euer they
could, for to holde their owne, and to remaine in the field,
but they respecting the two Paganes and saw that they
were the onely occasion of their retyring, and signe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
the two Princes <hi>Radamarte</hi> and <hi>Rodafeo,</hi> toke to

their Horses, with so great furie as possible was, the one
made his encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter against <hi>Bradaman,</hi> and the other against
<hi>Bramarant,</hi> who although they were on foote, yet for all that
by reason of the greatnesse and mightinesse of their persons,
were séene aboue all the rest: but it fell not out well with
these two Princes, for although they made their encounter
verie strongly, and brake their staues, yet did they them no

with so great furie, on their wastes, that they ouerthrew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

they had parted them a sunder in the middest. Forthwith
these furious Paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s passed forwards for to put themselues

done by the other two, determining not to return anie more
to proue themselues vpon the two Pagans that had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen

and do so much, that by force they might make the Pagans

Captaines who were verie valiant and stout knights, with
those knights that the Emperour had commanded, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

betwéene the Pagan host and them, they came vnto the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile,

lose the victorie, with all the force and furie possible, they
entred all together into the battaile, and slew many of their

lost, &amp; made the Pagans to retire vnto y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sea side, although
they were a great number more, then there were of the

wonderfull blowes, which caused them to loose a great part
of their brauerie, &amp; semed that those two were sufficient for

to destroy them all, who with verie broade and heauie fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins,
dyd put themselues amongst the Gréekes, some they

which <hi>Bradaman Campion,</hi> and his sonne dyd, and semed
vnto him that they two alone were sufficient for to destroy
a whole armie, and he saw that by their force, the Gréekes
began to loose ground, although euerie one of them did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

would not detaine himselfe any longer in the citie, &amp; seing
that the battaile was meruailously moued, he armed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with his strong, rich, and glistering armour. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> and the Emprisse <hi>Briana</hi> his

dyd it profit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very little, for that in taking lisence of the

With great furie entred these sixe worthie knights, into

who had the forehand, dyd charge his enimies with so great

Pagan kniges that dyd behold them out of the triumphant

likewise they were greatly amazed at the stoute
Troyan that rode by him, who ouerthrew &amp; slew with his

                  <hi>Bramarant</hi> the mightiest horse of bodie that euer was séene,
for that he was engendered by a horse and a she Elephant.
When that these two were mounted (for the euill of many)
they put themselues into the battaile, killing and slaying all
that euer they met withall, till such time as they had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
the worthie knight <hi>Rosicleer</hi> in the companie of his
good friends, &amp; for that <hi>Bramarant</hi> did shew himselfe of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
force than his father, by the mightie and mortall blowes
which he stroke, <hi>Rosicleer</hi> would take with him the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Troyan <hi>Oristedes</hi> with the stout <hi>Zoylo,</hi> went
against <hi>Bradaman,</hi> so that betwéene them there began a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
battaile, that all those that might sée them, forgot to
fight, and stood to behold them, &amp; séemed that in all their liues
they neuer sawe the like, for that they iudged to be ioyned
together there, all the force and strength in the world, there
did the good knight <hi>Rosicleer</hi> féele the great force and furie
of the Pagan, and it séemed vnto him that hée was the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
and most strongest that euer he proued in all his life.
Likewise the stout <hi>Bramarant</hi> did knowe his high bountie
and valiant force, for féeling the mightie blowes which hée
stroke on him, and séeing the little harme that his blowe did
vnto the knight, with an angrie courage he blasphemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the heauens, and against the earth, and redoubled his
blowes with so great furie, that if the armour of <hi>Rosicleer</hi>
had not ben excéeding good, euerie blow of them had ben suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for to haue clouen him a sunder in the middest, and
yet for all that he many times astonied him, &amp; brought him
so farre out of remembraunce, that he fell forwards on his
saddle bow and embraced his horse necke, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this stout Pagan did not much aduance himselfe of his
valiantnesse, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> this worthie Gréeke being kindled with
ire, did with mortal courage so charge him in such sort, that
his téeth did breake the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

his blowes, that great abundance of bloud ranne out at his

to fal from his horse, so that betwixt them the battaile grew
so terrible, that all those that were in the field forgot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13995:98"/>
and did beholde them, and were greatlie amazed that
so much power and force shoulde be in humane creatures.
No lesse worth for to be looked on at that present, was the
mightie battaile that passed betwixt the stout <hi>Bramarant</hi> &amp;
the two good knights, the Tartarian &amp; the Troyan, for that
<hi>Bradaman</hi> was the strongest that was to be found amongst
all the Gyants in the whole world at that time. Likewise
the two knights were the best that were to be found in all
that great hoast, next vnto <hi>Rosicleer</hi> and <hi>Bramarant,</hi> which
was the occasion that the battaile which was betwixt them
was the more rigorous, for that the stout Tartarian stroke
<hi>Bradaman</hi> such terrible blowes on the one side, that he asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him, and the valiaunt Troyan so charged him on the
other side, that he made the bloud to runne out both at his
nose and mouth, yet for all that the mightie Pagan did not
dismaie himselfe, but was so couragious, that euerie blowe
that hée fastned on his enimies, did make them to double
their bodies in their saddles, and many times to loose their
remembrance, and if they had not béene both against him
together, either of them alone should haue passed verie euill.
Thus after that this battaile had endured betwéene them
the space of halfe an houre, the night drew on, and then was
there disembarked a land so great and infinite a companie
of Pagans, that the Greekes could not suffer them, but were
constrained to retire, the which <hi>Rosicleer</hi> séeing, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

left <hi>Bramarant</hi> with whom he did combat, and called
vnto his friends, who did the like, so that in short space with
their light and swift courses, they put themselues amongst
the Greekes, and returning backe in verie good order, they
got into the citie, the which was no griefe vnto the Pagans,
although the <hi>gran Campeon</hi> and <hi>Bramarant</hi> remained ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
angrie and furious, for that they could not be reuenged
on those knightes that dyd so much abase them. And by
reason that the night drew on a pace, the Emperour <hi>Aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candro</hi>
commaunded his Tents to bée pitched, and all
<pb facs="tcp:13995:99"/>
that night they had inough to doe to disimbarke the rest of
the people that came in that fléete. But when that the next
morning was come, they might sée all the field of <hi>Grecia</hi> so
replenished with barbarous people, that neuer before that
time was séene so many people in one armie, there was so
many that they could not be numbred, to know how many
they were, but that they might discerne euerie Nation was
diuided by themselues, and knowen the one from the other.
Likewise to sée the great difference they had the one from
the other in their tents, the fashion of their armour, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities
of spéeches, and the contrarietie of their customes
and manners, that no man whatsoeuer he were that should
haue séene them, but woulde haue meruailed, and receiued
great admiration, the Emperial tent of the Emperour was
all wrought with gold and siluer, full of an infinite number
of fine, prcious, and glistering stones, and was of so huge
bignesse, that a thousand armed knights might walke ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Within the same tent was the Emperiall seate of the
Emperour, and round about it the seates of all the other
kings his vassals, in such order placed, as it was in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
hall of his pallace, and round about the same Tent
was placed the tents of the Tartarians and of the <hi>Scitas,</hi>
with an infinit number of tents and pauillians belonging
vnto them. In like order was placed the tents of the other
kings his vassals, euerie one in his degrée. These Pagans
were eight daies, and had inough to do to fortefie their tents
and trenches, in which time the Gréekes gaue no attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Pagans, for that the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> dyd
send and asked truce of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> for eight
daies, the which was for no other thing, but onelie that the
Gréekes might fréelie enter into their campe for to sée &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
their mightie power, and so they did, for in the space
of that eight daies, the Gréekes did no other thing but goe
and come into the camp and hoast of the Pagans, and were
greatlie amazed to sée so many and so different Nations ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together, and so conformable for to obey and accomplish
the commandement of their Lord. Likewise in this time the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13995:99"/>
good Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> hearkened to no other thing but
to send to his knights from one place vnto another, in the
demand and séeking of the knight of the Sunne, and when
that he could not heare anie newes by them, hée was verie
sad and sorrowfull for the same, as well for the suspition hée
had of some misfortune that might happen vnto him, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

Here in this conflict might be séene how necessarie is the
armour, vnto good knights, such as are made and forged by

the one from the other, assuring their owne persons in such
sort, that all the condition of their battailes did depend in
their great force and stregth, and in him that most mighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and worthely with dexteritie did strike and deliuer his
blowes. So that in this conflict, although the blowes of
<hi>Bramarant</hi> were wonderfull and terrible, yet dyd <hi>Rosicleer</hi>
receiue &amp; abide them on the finenesse of his armour, which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13995:102"/>
were of the best that was in all the whole world: likewise
in the valiantnesse of his courage, which was not onely for
to make resistance against that furious Pagan, but also he
did so furiously and so strongly charge him with his blowes,
that many times he made him astonied and to sweat drops
of bloud, for that of trueth <hi>Bramarant</hi> thought before hée
made a profe of this knight, that in all the heauens and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the earth, there was not to be found one that durst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde
his importunate furie, wherewith he receiued so great
courage and anger, that with an infernall stomacke he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
his blowes against the strong &amp; worthie <hi>Rosicleer,</hi>
in such sort that his owne flesh and bones dyd ake, &amp; it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that the other was all on fyer, with the great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of sparkes that he made flie out of his fine forged armor.
Likewise, was no lesse rigorous, the braue &amp; stout battaile
the which <hi>Bradaman Campion,</hi> had with the two valiant
knights, for that the <hi>Gran Campion,</hi> next vnto his sonne
<hi>Bramarant,</hi> was the most mightiest and strongest that was
in all the whole Orient, whome the stout <hi>Troyan</hi> and the
valiant King <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> together, dyd so stronglie charge
with their blowes, that it could not be better executed, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that he hadde bene assauted by the two worthie <hi>Troyans,
Hector,</hi> and <hi>Troylus.</hi> In this sort was these two so stoute
captains matched with their contraries, &amp; the other knights
and souldiers did all that euer they could for to driue theyr
enimies out of the field, but by reason that on the Pagans
part, there was that stout and valiant knight <hi>Rodaran,</hi> the
King of <hi>Media,</hi> and the King of <hi>Seras,</hi> and on the contrarie
part, there was none for to make resistance vnto those, they
made great slaughter vpon the Gréekes, by reason whereof,
as also for that there were twise so many of the Pagans as
they were, they began to retyre, &amp; to lose ground, the which
being perceiued by the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> he would not
detaine himselfe any longer in the Citie, but taking in his
companie those high and mightie Princes the king <hi>Florion</hi>
and <hi>Brandizel</hi> his sonne, the <hi>Tartarian Zoylo, Bargandel,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Liriamendro,</hi> with <hi>Don Lucindo,</hi> &amp; other mightie princes
<pb facs="tcp:13995:103"/>
and knights the most principal of all his court, he issued out
of the citie, and had with him thirtie thousand knights ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
good and chosen men, and so entred into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> battaile with
great furie, deuiding themselues into two parts, that what
with killing, wounding, and slaying, they oppressed so much
their enimies, that they forced the Pagans to retyre into
their trenches, whereas the Gréekes in following of them,
ouerthrew many tents, but straight waies ther came forth
against them more then fiftie thousande Pagans with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
and stout captaines, &amp; made their encounter with the
other that came vppon them a fresh, in such sorte, that the
battaile was renewed and waxed verie bloudie. Here was
to be séene y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> great meruailes done by the Emperour <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio,</hi>
in distroying and killing all that was before him, for
some he cut a sunder in the middest, and other their armes,
and other their heads, in such sort, that who soeuer had sene
him with that impetious furie, they could not haue iudged
him, but to be either his sonne <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> or y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> knight of the
Sunne, and in his mightie déedes, he did demonstrate, that
there was not a Christian prince that with more reason did
deserue to beare the name to be father of so excelent sonnes.
He did not content himselfe to kil &amp; destroy meane knights,
but did séeke out the principall captaines, &amp; knowing them
by the richnesse of their armour, he would assalt them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
rekoning, that in ouercomming them, he ouerlayed the
whole state and force of the battaile, and there with he met
with the king of the <hi>Seras,</hi> and knowing him, by a riche
crowne of Gold and precious stones which he had vpon his
helme, he tooke a speare from one of his knights, and ranne
at him therewith, making his encounter in the middest of
his brest, that the speare pearsed through his bodie, and he
fell dead to the ground, this being done he made an other
encounter against the king of the <hi>Balibotros</hi> (who receiued
little benefit of his thirtie thousand knights, and eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Elephants, which he brought out of his countrie) for
that at one thrust with a speare, his heart was clouen a

which had his healme more furnished with golde and

the battaile doing such meruailes, that whereas he passed,
they all made him roome and gaue waie. Then the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

Tarrie a while (sayd the olde king of <hi>Gedrosia)</hi> for that is
not the knight of the Sun as you do saie, but it is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Trebatio</hi> his Father, who when that he himselfe in
the middest betwixt his sonnes, and accompanied with that
bushments of knights which now are with him, he wil not
feare all the whole world, if they were all together against
him. At this time who so had séene the great slaughter which

Prince <hi>Clauerindo</hi> with the Tartarian <hi>Zoylo,</hi> and all the
other precious and worthie knights, surely they would haue
saide, that by experience of the great slaughter which they
did, they had ben sufficient to haue destroied a great armie,
that although the Pagans were almost twice so many as
they were, yet by their occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they lost continually ground,
and if there had not béene amongst them one <hi>Bradaman</hi> and

had inough to doe to haue defended themselues from them
with whom they were so earnest in battaile withal, for that
it was good two houres since they first began fight, and at
that time there was no more aduantage to be knowen than
at their first beginning, at the which these braue Pagans
were so furious, that it séemed that they threw out smoake
from the beauers of their healmes, and béeing verie desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to satisfie their hungrie wrath with the bloud of the
others, <hi>Bramarant</hi> dyd leaue <hi>Rosicleer</hi> with whome he dyd

battaile, destroying and killing all that euer hee met with,
so that before him hée made a broade lane, and sayd within
himselfe, that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was verie valiant and strong, and
could not beléeue that the knight of the Sunne had so much
strength, but yet if that he might haue him in place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they might haue more roome, and time for to finish their
combat, hée would be wholie reuenged of him according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his will and desire. Likewise at that time <hi>Bradaman</hi> his
Father, with his sword in both his hands stroke so strong
a blow at the good Troyan vpon his helme, that béeing all
amazed and from himselfe, his horse carried him round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the field, and turning himselfe about, hée stroke ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
blow at the king <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> that hée fell backwardes
vpon his horse crouper, and had fallen to the ground, if that
he had not béene succoured by the Gréekes, and without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
anie more account of them, hée put himselfe into the
battaile after his sonne, and béeing both together, they made
so great slaughter, that all did flie from that part whereas
they went. It dyd not much grieue <hi>Rosicleer</hi> nor his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
to sée themselues separated from those diuells, yet
with great furie they put themselues into the battaile, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and ouerthrowing all that euer came into their waie,
in such sorte, that it went euill with a great number, for
that they were separated from the battaile which they had
with those stout Pagans.</p>
               <p>At this time the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> met with that

that betwixt them there began a stout and braue battaile,
that many had inough to doe to behold them, and the rest of

done by <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and by all the other worthie Princes and
knightes, who being ioyned together with the number of
one thousand of their knightes, did put themselues to make
resistance against all those Gyants, and with their strong
and worthy armes did resist that impetuous companie, who
were sufficient to put them all to flight. Héere did the stout

sauing onelie <hi>Bradaman</hi> and <hi>Bramarant</hi> his sonne, who was

hée followed the Gréekes almost vnto the Citie before they

but that the valiant <hi>Rosicleer</hi> with all those worthie
knights returned vpon them, so that betwixt them there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
a terrible and cruell battaile, for that <hi>Bramarant</hi> stroke
such cruell blowes at the stout <hi>Oristedes</hi> and the Tartarian
<hi>Zoylo,</hi> that with two alonelie strokes hée amazed and lefte
them without remembraunce, and made the bloud to gush

blow, for that <hi>Bramarant</hi> turning himselfe about with his

               <p>In like manner <hi>Bradaman</hi> intreated the strong <hi>Florion</hi>

good Emperor <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and with them the king <hi>Sacridoro,</hi>
&amp; in such sort they began to deale their blowes vpon those
furious Pagans and knights that were in their companie,
that it séemed to be no other thing but a Smiths forge, for
that the great noise of their blowes were heard throughout
the whole armie, and although it was night, yet there repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
an infinit number of Pagans to aide and help them, but
yet for all that they would not abide, séeing how stronglie
they were assaulted and laide on, vppon a sodaine they set
spurs vnto their mightie horse and Elephant, and ranne
through the rout of knights like a whirle winde, and went
towards their owne campe as diuells that came new out of
hell, méeting by the waie more than one hundreth thousand
Pagans that came to helpe them, and béeing night, they all
retourned vnto their trenches together, but <hi>Bramarant</hi> was
so farre out of charitie and angrie because that one
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13995:105"/>
alone knight had almost all that daie maintained the field a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, that he would not come in the presence of the
Emperour <hi>Alycandro,</hi> till such time as hee in person came
vnto his tent, and taking both father &amp; sonne by the hands,
he carried them both vnto his tent, whereas he did them so
much honour as vnto his owne person, and praysed verie
much the meruailous déeds the which he did that daie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would giue them contentment, for that in the great
force and strength of these two, the Emperour had better
confidence than in all the kings and Captaines together in
all his whole armie. The same night hée did inuite to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in his Emperiall Tent, all the most principall amongst
them, whereas they were together with great ioy, pleasure,
and pastimes, although it grieued them verie much the

that it caused feare in all them that did behold them.
At this time the Gréekes were entered into the Citie,
and being all lodged, euerie one according vnto his calling,
they all supped with the Emperour in his mightie pallace,
whereas they had inough for to declare of the mightie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

and swéete flowers) they sawe come towardes them
running with their horses as fast as possible they could two
knights, and following after them one alone knight of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
bigge stature and mounted on a great horse, with his
sword drawen in his hand, and ouertaking one of them, hée
stroke him such a blowe vppon his helme, that he cloue his
head in two péeces, &amp; ouerthrew him vnto the ground dead,
and the other knight with the great feare he had, went vnto
the Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> and séeing him of so gallant disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and well armed, he sayd.</p>
               <p>Ah Sir Knight, saue and defend mée from this traitor,
who hath slaine the rest of my companions, and would also
slaie mée. Then the Prince who was indued with all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
drew out his sword, and put himselfe before that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
knight that followed the other, and saide. Sir Knight,
stand and kéepe your selfe aloofe, and let vs vnderstand the
occasion wherefore you will in this sorte kill this knight?
Then the great knight sayde: Tarrie and I will quicklie
make thée account of this which thou doest demaund. And
therewithall he stroke him with his sworde in both his
handes such a blow vpon his helme, that he daseled his sight,
and made him to boow forwards vpon his saddle bow. Yet
he boasted not much of the striking of the same, for that the
Prince stroke him such another blowe, that he declined his
head to his breast, giuing him to vnderstand his greate va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
which was the occasion that betwixt them began a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
battaile, and they laide the one vppon the other so
stronglie, that all the woods did sound with the noise of their
blowes, and the sparkles of fire flew from their healmes, as
out of a Smiths forge. In this sorte this battaile endured
betwixt these two valiant knights one whole houre, &amp; there
was no vauntage knowen of either part. But the Prince
<hi>Meridian</hi> was greatlie amazed at the mightie force and
strength of his aduersarie, and it séemed vnto him that they
were equal vnto the blows which he receiued of the knight
of the Sunne, at such time as he had battaile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The like thought his aduersarie, for you shall vnderstand
that this stout and valiant knight was <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> who
had trauailed many daies in those woods and wildernesse,
in the demand of the knight of the Sunne, for to conclude
with him this battaile, and by fortune he met that daie with
the foure knights that fled awaie from him, &amp; were théeues
that ranged in that wildernesse, two of them he had slaine,
and the other two he chased at such time as hée met with
<hi>Meridian,</hi> and as these two valiant and worthie knightes
had continued a long time in this their furious battaile,
without resting themselues, in the end they began to waxe
weary of their great trauaile, and withdrawing themselues
a part the one from the other, <hi>Brandimardo</hi> béeing greatlie
amazed at the strength of his aduersarie, saide: Knight, let
vs take breath and ease our selues, for that there remaineth
time inough to make an end and conclude this our battaile.
Let it be as your pleasure is, sayde the Prince, but yet I
would gladlie know before we doe returne vnto the same
againe, what is the occasion that moueth thée to make this
contention with me, and to take so much trauaile &amp; paines
for to ouercome me. There is no other thing that doth moue
me (sayd <hi>Brandimardo)</hi> but onlie because thou doest deliuer
out of my handes that false knight which is runne awaie
from me, who is a thiefe and a robber, and kept companie
with other sixe whome I haue slaine, and ranged this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
forcing of damsels, and did great harme and robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Then am I greatlie deceiued (sayde <hi>Meridian)</hi> for I
thought verilie that you followed him to kill him without
cause, as he tolde me, but if it be true as you do tell me, I am
verie sorrie for that which I haue done, for I had rather he
should receiue the merite of his desert, than to contend with
you. These words which <hi>Meridian</hi> said did not grieue <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimardo</hi>

which doest giue of thy selfe is reasonable, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is no iust cause wherefore we should prosecute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

<pb facs="tcp:13995:110"/>

who thou art, for that I cannot persuade with my selfe that
in this Countrie there should be found so valiant a knight
as thou art, but onelie he who is called the knight of the
Sunne, whom I doe goe in his demand and séeking in this
wildernesse. Héerein (sayd <hi>Meridian)</hi> I am verie well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and am glad that so valiant a Knight as thou art wilt
become my friend, and héere I doe protest to bée yours,
and therefore you shall vnderstand that I am called <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi>
and am sonne vnto the Emperour <hi>Alycandro,</hi> Lord of
the <hi>gran Tartaria.</hi> Let all graces and thankes ascend vnto
the high Gods (sayd <hi>Brandimardo)</hi> that a knight of so high
bloud and diuine generation hath giuen himselfe this daie
to bée my friend, and therefore (worthie Prince) you shall

(of the which warres I am sure you haue heard off

               <p>Then <hi>Meridian</hi> who had heard great report and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

embracing the one the other, they remayned great friendes,
and a conclusion was made betwixt them for to depart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vnto the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> his campe, at whose
comming there was great ioy and pleasure. This they put
straight waies in execution, and departing from that place
they left the wildernesse of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and in a few daies after
they came vnto the great and mightie armie of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Alycandro,</hi> who were not a little amazed to see so
great a multitude of people, and of diuerse Nations as were
there ioyned together. When they came vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Tent, they were knowen by the Emperour, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
them with so greate ioye and pleasure at that
present, that there was nothing that could giue him more
contentment, for that many dayes hée was verie sadde and
sorrowfull, because hée coulde heare no newes of his sonne

               <p>When these two armies were ioyned together, with all
spéed possible they trauailed til they came into the Empire of
<hi>Grecia,</hi> and at their ariuall thrée miles from the Citie of
<pb facs="tcp:13995:111"/>
                  <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> had aduertisement
of the same. Who séeing that almost all the whole worlde
was risen vp against him, he praied vnto God to be his aide
and succour, and that he would not permit that in such sort
the Christian Countrie should be destroied. Then the good
knight <hi>Rosicleer</hi> séeing his Father in so great distresse, and
he himselfe verie desirous to knowe what people they were
that were come from great <hi>Britaine,</hi> hée went forth of the
Citie all armed with new armour, which was brought and
giuen him by the wise <hi>Lirgandeo,</hi> mounted on a verie good
horse, with his speare in his hand, alonelie with one Squire
which did beare him companie, and went towards the hoast
of the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> &amp; when he came within a mile where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they laie, he went vppon a little mountaine which was
nigh vnto the high waie, from the which by reason that they
marched forwards vpon plaine ground, he might fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence
discouer and sée all the whole armie of the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi>
and part of the hoast of the Pagans, and séeing so gallant a
companie of armed knights, and so many Ensignes with red
crosses, to make warre against Christians, the one agaynst
the other, he receiued great sorrowe and griefe at his heart,
séeming that all Christendome was then at the point to bée
lost, and praied vnto God from the bottom of his heart that
he would not looke vpon the sinnes of the Christians, but in
that great extremitie to defend them with his owne hands.
Thus he being in this Oration, he sawe come a farre off to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that place a knight, with his galloping like vnto a
post, and séemed that he came from the armie of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.
Then he falling into reckoning what it might be (as
he that was of a rare and quicke vnderstanding) straight
waies he descended from the mountaine whereas he was,
and passed to the other side, in such sort, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> knight might
not sée him, and ranne with his horse all that euer he could
towards the host of the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> so that he was a good
waie off from the mountaine, and séeing himselfe a good
distance from the knight, he turned his horse about, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little he trauailed, dissembling as though hée had
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13995:111"/>
come from that mightie armie. Then the knight when hée
had discouered him, who was a valiant Pagan and king of
the <hi>Masageras,</hi> called <hi>Antipatro,</hi> and by the commandement
of the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> went for to discouer &amp; knowe
what people they were, for that it was tolde him that a

flags with the armes of Christians, and hée beléeuing that
they came in the fauour and helpe of the Emperour <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio,</hi>
he sent the king to know who they were, and what
companie of people, onelie for that hée had heart &amp; good will
for to giue them battaile, first before they could recou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wrathfull for the other succour which came vnto him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and being within the Citie, it was at the will of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
at all times to giue them battaile, and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
to take their ease at their pleasures, without anie so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
alarum for to disturbe them. The which was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vnto the Pagans, for that it dyd behoue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at all times
to be in a readinesse, because they did not know the time nor
houre when that their aduersaries would assault them, for
the which occasion the Emperour <hi>Alicandro</hi> was verie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie,
and determined to giue them battaile in the field, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they should haue anie time or leasure for to recouer the
entrie of the Citie, thinking they had come in the aide and
succour of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio.</hi> The king <hi>Antipatro</hi>
comming in the demand, as you haue heard, when that hée
came vnto the mountaine, went vnto the top thereof for to
discouer the whole armie that was comming, &amp; was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
amazed to see such a multitude of gallant knightes, but
when that he sawe <hi>Rosicleer</hi> come that waie, who séemed
that he came from the hoast, with all the spéede he coulde he
descended from the mountaine, and at the foote thereof hée
did abide till such time as <hi>Rosicleer</hi> should passe by, who did
salute him verie curteouslie, and the king said. Tell mée sir
Knight, are you of that great armie that is héere before? I
am thereof (sayd <hi>Rosicleer)</hi> but wherefore doe you aske mée
that question? I doe aske, (said the king) because I woulde
<pb facs="tcp:13995:112"/>
knowe what people and Nation they are, and what is the
occasion of their comming hether. All those that you sée there
comming (sayd <hi>Rosicleer)</hi> be Christians, and their comming
is for to defend Christendome, for that there are so many
Pagans ariued in <hi>Grecia.</hi> Then the king <hi>Antipatro</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
these wordes, not knowing who it was with whome
he talked and demaunded that question, sayd: Knight, thou
shalt vnderstand that the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> my Lorde
hath sent mée to knowe perticularlie what people those be,
and for that I will not staie for to knowe it at thy handes
in that order, I thinke it best that I carrie thée prisoner with
mée, and then thou maist declare it better vnto him, and
aunswere him vnto all that shall bée demaunded of thée,
whereby hee shall bée fullie certefied of his request, therefore
come and goe with mée out of hande, if thou doest not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
first to proue the great force of my encounter, and the
swift course of my horse.</p>
               <p>It is follie (sayd <hi>Rosicleer)</hi> of him that is at libertie, to
become bondman vnto another, before hée first proue a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>réere,
hauing Speares in our handes, therefore let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne,
and hée that is first pushed vnto the ground, let him
remaine prisoner vnto him that kéepeth himselfe in his
Saddle.</p>
               <p>I am thereof verie well content (sayd the Pagan with a
gallant courage) but yet I woulde not that by the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which I shall giue vnto thée, that thou shouldest be hurt
or receiue anie harme, whereby I could not carrie thée with
mée prisoner. I commit my selfe vnto fortune (sayde <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer)</hi>
but if it should so happen it would bée the worse for
mée. Wherewith both of them tourned about their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
who were verie fierce and swift, and when they hadde
taken the vauntage of the ground as they thought best, with
great furie, and like vnto a whirle winde they came the one
against the other, the Pagan king with great brauerie flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
with his Speare, thinking verilie to sée his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
on the ground, but yet his great pride fell out contrarie
vnto his expectation, for that in the middest of his course,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13995:112"/>
they made their encounter in such sort, that hée shèeuered his
speare all to péeces vpon the hard harneis of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing vnto him anie harme at all, nor mooued him in the
Saddle, more than if hée had encountered against an harde
Rocke, but <hi>Rosicleer</hi> made his encounter in such sorte,
that he pushed him out of his saddle, making him slie into the
aire, and fell on his backe to the grounde a great waie from
his horse, and as <hi>Rosicleer</hi> woulde haue retourned againe
vpon him, hée found that hée was verie euill intreated with
that encounter and fall, so that he coulde not arise from the
ground without greate paine and griefe, and was so asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of that which had happened, that he had no tongue for
to speake one word.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Rosicleer</hi> said: Sir knight, arise vp and take thy
horse, and goe thy waies vnto the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> thy
Lorde, and declare vnto him all that which hath happened
vnto thée, and also tell him how that there is in this armie
so great and infinite a number of knightes, that with their
helpe the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> will verie shortlie driue all
the Pagans out of his Countrie.</p>
               <p>The king <hi>Antipatro</hi> was verie glad to sée himselfe at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
for that he thought verily he would haue carried him
awaie prisoner. So without determining of himselfe anie
longer, hée tooke his leaue of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and mounting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
his horse, with all the spéede possible he could, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto his companie, and comming before the Emperour
<hi>Alycandro</hi> (who was in his tent with a great number of
kings and Princes) before them all he declared what had
happened vnto him with the christian knight, and although
it was a griefe vnto them for the aide &amp; succour which they
thought was come vnto the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> yet could
they not let but to laugh at that which had happened vnto
the king <hi>Antipatro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then straight waies the Emperour with the consent and

y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they should put in order their battaile against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

that in fiftéene daies before they of the Citie neuer came
forth, and they without were in despaire, because it was at
the will of them that were within to come forth when they
thought best, but in especial those two furious Pagans <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daman</hi>
and <hi>Bramarant,</hi> who were verie hungrie, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
for to shedde humane bloud. Likewise those valiant

the time long till such time as they might giue a shew of
their great bountie and strength, there was in that campe to
the number of fiftie principall knights, such as might well
be said to be the flower of all the Pagans, and besides them
there were so infinit a number of verie furious and stout
Pagans, that there remained but a few more in all the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
of the Ocian sea, and amongst them ther was twelue
kings, subiects and vassals vnto the <hi>gran Campeon,</hi> &amp; other

thought that there was no humane force in all the whole

in a readinesse and good order those which should goe forth
vnto the battaile, the <hi>gran Campeon</hi> and his sonne <hi>Brama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
tooke the foreward, and had in their company the twelue
giant kinges, with all those that they brought out of their
Countries, besides those, they carried fortie thousand
knights of the Tartarians, and next vnto them followed
<hi>Rodaran</hi> king of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the stout king of <hi>Media,</hi> the
king of the <hi>Partes,</hi> and the king of the <hi>Affricanos, Candaros,</hi>
and <hi>Baricanos,</hi> all the other which wer verie valiant &amp; stout,
they also carried with them other fiftie thousand Pagans
of other Nations. The third battaile was lead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

with twelue Gyants verie bigge, furious, and terrible
to beholde, which went onelie with him for the safegard of

This being done, the Emperour would not ordaine anie
more battailes, for that those which were ordained, serued
sufficient for to maintaine the battaile all that daye: and
being in a readinesse, they remained, waiting till such time

there, when that he descouered to come from that great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
of the king <hi>Oliuerio</hi> foure knights in maner of postes,
who came before the rest for to discouer the enimie: but
when he saw them somewhat farre of from the armie, and
nigh vnto the place where as he was, he descended from the
mountaine, and put himselfe in the high way, and trauailed
forwards til such time as he met with them, who séeing him

                  </gap>, I am saide he, but wherefore do you aske
mée this question, we doe aske thée this (said one of them)
for to know how manie miles it is from hence vnto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
and to know in what estate remaines the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Trebatio,</hi> where he hath aduise of our comming or
not, therefore knight aduertise vs the trueth thereof, if thou
wilt not be our prisoner. To whome <hi>Rosicleer</hi> aunswered
and saide, as followeth.</p>
               <p>Of trueth I am very well content to certifie you of this
that you doe demaund of mée, for that it is not a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing
from knighthood, but that I may verie well do it
without anie compulsion: You shall vnderstand that from
this place vnto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> you haue two miles, and
touching the estate of the Emperour, know of trueth, that
he is all in a redinesse and tarrying your comming in the
field, with no lesse mightie and puissant an armie, then this
which your Lord the King <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> doth bring with him,
and be you assured of this, that when you shall come nigh

within a mile of the citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he will méete
with you in the way with all his people, and giue you a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
terrible and rigorous battaile. The foure knights were
verie much amazed at this which <hi>Rosicleer</hi> had told them,
for that they thought verely that the Emperour had not
bene in so great readinesse, and without any more wordes
they left him, and returned from whence they came, for to
giue aduice vnto the king, how that his enimies were in
a redinesse and would méete him in the way and giue him
battaile. So when they came before him, and gaue him to
vnderstand of all that had passed, he straight waies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to put all his owne armie in a redinesse, for as
they were gallant and well armed knights, it was a iolie
thing to behold: he made then repetition of his armie, and
deuided them in foure parts, the forefront he gaue vnto the

and were of the principall house of the <hi>Godos,</hi> they were
both very valiant, the one of them was called <hi>Don Claros,</hi>
and the other <hi>Arcalus,</hi> and there comming vnto these wars
onely for to proue themselues, and giue to vnderstand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>These two carryed with them fortie thousand knights,
twentie thousand of them were of Spaine, and the other
twentie thousand of <hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> and in their companie
went to the number of twentie knights of the <hi>Godos,</hi> who
did not a little in this battaile. The second battaile was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto the gouernement of <hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> with other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

England, Ireland, &amp; Scotland: the third battaile had a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
knight of Hungaria, with all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> knights of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And the fourth and rereward, the king had, with all
the high Princes of his kingdome, and the rest of all the
people that remained. When that they were all diuided
and seperated in foure battailes, and in good order and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse,
they began to march forwards by little and little,
till such time as the scoutes as well of the one parte, as of
the other, had discouered the armies, which came to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13995:114"/>
and hauing aduice of the same, they marched on the
faster, till such time as the forewards of either part, was
within a cros bow shot, the one from the other, which might
be about two of the clocke in the after none. All this time
was <hi>Rosicleer</hi> beholding what passed, vpon a littell hill,
where at he receiued great contentment, thinking the tyme
long to sée them together by the eares in battaile, his desire
was not long delated, for as those two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Bradaman</hi> and <hi>Bramarant</hi> came before all the rest, thinking
the time long to sée themselues amongst their enimies, they
pressed forwards towards them with so great furie, that it

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>med the earth to shake. And although their furious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunces
was sufficient to put in feare anie good knight
that did behold them, yet those two valiant brothers, <hi>Don
Claros</hi> and <hi>Arcalus,</hi> putting themselues before all their
companie, went forth to meete them, and in the face of both
armies, they made their encounters verie strongly, <hi>Brada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
who did encounter with <hi>Don Claros,</hi> lost his stirrups

without falling. <hi>Bramarant</hi> was encountered by

                  </gap>ll out euell, for a
great number, the little profit that they had by this encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
for being full of great courage, and encenced with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
in a short space they furnished the wide and broade
fieldes full of dead bodies of their enimies, not sparing any
degrée, that they dyed all the grasse with bloud of the great
<pb facs="tcp:13995:115"/>
destruction they made on their aduersaries, and in such sort
they besturred themselues amongst them, that all that did
sée them iudged them to be diuelles of hell, for that they cut
knights asunder in the wast, slashing and cutting all that
euer they could reach, and some they cloue from the head
downe vnto the girdell, with the which their aduersaries
receiued so great feare, that they fled before them as sheepe
before wolues, on the contrarie part the two brethren dyd
such maruailes and wonders vpon the Paganes, that their
déedes were to be noted that day: therewithal the first two
battailes were ioyned together, which was as gallant a
sight to be séene as euer was, the brauerie of the knightes
was such, for that in the forefront came the twelue kinges
Giantes, with the two thousand that came with them from
their Ilands, against whome there went to receiue them,
twelue knights of the <hi>Godos,</hi> who séeing them so great and
huge vpon the Elephants, made their encounter in such sort,
that the one and the other were ouerthrowen to the ground:
likewise, all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest made their encounters, so that in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there were more then ten thousand ouerthrowen, and
their horses roming about the fielde, fighting one with an
other, so that betwixt them there was a new battaile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne:
here in this conflict, did the knights of Spaine show
their great valour, for that there was none that did make
their resistance with so great force against those Gyants,
killing some of them, and rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uing their owne deathes with
great courage. In this battaile <hi>Don Claros</hi> slew one of the
twelue knights of <hi>Bradaman,</hi> with a speare that he thrust
through and through his bodie, with a forcible and strong
encounter.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Arcalus</hi> slewe an other with the strength of his
arme, in tormenting him with his terrible blowes vppon
the head, which was the occasion that they were in great
perill of death, if that the valiaunt knights of Spaine had
not come in time to haue succored them, for that a great
number of those monsters had compassed them about, who
were mightie and verie strong, so that those two valiant
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13995:115"/>
bretheren should euill haue escaped their hands, but being
ioyned together their battaile was more equall then before
and better fought: yet all dyd profit verye little the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
for the getting of the field, for that the bushment of
those Orientall Gyants, made so great slaughter amongst
them, that they were not able to make any resistance, but to
receiue cruel death. On the other side was those infernal pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
father &amp; sonne <hi>Bradaman</hi> and <hi>Bramarant</hi> killing and
slaying with great crueltie, all that euer they could reach
with their swords, they made so great destruction, that it
séemed there were not people enough in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> campe for to hold
them play that daye, which was the occasion that within
halfe an houre after that the battaile was begon, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
began to lose ground, and to retyre towards their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
and in some place they were not content to retyre lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, but turned their backes and ranne away all
that euer they could, in especial, there whereas was <hi>Brada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
and <hi>Bramarant</hi> and the rest of the other Gyants, who
were sufficient for to destroy a whole armie. Then when
that <hi>Don Siluario</hi> sawe that the Christians lost ground, he
straight waies commaunded y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> all those of his charge should
march forwards, who straight waies with great fiercenesse
put themselues into the battaile, at whose entre, many of
the Pagans lost their liues, and the Christians began to
get ground againe: but straight waies that mightie knight
<hi>Rodaran,</hi> and the king of <hi>Media,</hi> and the other kings that
were with him, put themselues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orwards with their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and when they came vnto the battaile (by reason that
they were so many, and their captaines so valiant) they did
make great slaughter vpon their came in the enimies, and to conclude,
the power of their enimies was so great, that they made the
Christians to runne awaye almost round about the fielde,
in such sort, that the valiant knights of spaine, could not
succour them, for that they were enclosed in battailing with
the Gyants, and had enough to doe to defende themselues
from them. Then straight vpon that, came in the knig hts of
Hungaria, at whose entrie, the battale was renewed and
<pb facs="tcp:13995:116"/>
began to get ground, and had put them to the foyle, if that
the third armie of the Pagans had not stepped forwards,
in the which came that worthie prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> and the
stout knight <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> who entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battaile with
so great furie, that that day was wonderfull vnto the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and knew not how and in what sort the Emperour
<hi>Trebatio,</hi> should haue so great a power of knights and gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
except they should come out of <hi>Persia,</hi> for that they
knew and vnderstoode, that all that countrie were in great
friendship with the knight of the Sunne, and manie there
were that repented themselues of their comming into Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
in especiall <hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> when he saw so great destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongst his men, and the field so full of dead bodies,
the teares fell from his eyes, with the great sorow &amp; griefe
which he receiued at his heart, and accused himselfe of the
euill counsell which he gaue vnto the king <hi>Oliuero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When that two howers was passed since the beginning
of the battaile, all the people of his part began to retire, for
that they could not suffer the great furie of the Pagans, so
that of verie force and necessitie, it did accomplish the king
<hi>Oliuerio,</hi> to enter into battaile with all those knights that
remained on his charge, who were manie in number, and
verie good. And although the Pagans were Lordes of the
field, yet at their comming they lost all that euer they had
got before, and the battaile renewed and better fought, and
the field so full of dead bodies, that the liuing could scarce
passe for them.</p>
               <p>Here was to be noted, the diuelishnesse of <hi>Bramarant,</hi>
and his father, and the high knighthood of <hi>Meridian,</hi> and of
<hi>Brandimardo,</hi> and of that stout knight <hi>Rodaran,</hi> and of the
king of <hi>Media,</hi> that it might be saide they were sepulchres
vnto the Christians: which was not a litle griefe vnto <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer,</hi>
(who from that little hill did behold all that passed)
for to sée so much Christian bloud so spilt and shed, with
those heathenish Pagans, although he thought all might
be well suffered, for to eschue a greater inconuenience that
(vnto the contrarie) might happen vnto Christendome.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13995:116"/>
To conclude, the day passed awaie, and there remained no
more but one houre of the Sunne setting, when that the
battaile was in equall sorte, and the one got no ground of
the other, but followed their entresse, the one killing the
other, without all pittie, at which time the fourth armie of
the Pagans entred, which were many in number, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
with so great furie into the battaile, that those of the
king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> not being able to suffer their force, began to
loose ground: The which being perceiued by <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> that
by no meanes they could not, but be ouercome and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
(as one that was a good knight &amp; verie pittifull) would
vse charitie with them, for that the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> was Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnto the princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> as also for to saue the liues
of so many Christians, which looked for no other but death
that daie, and hauing before sent aduice of all that had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vnto the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> by his page, he then des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
from that hill, and so fast as his horse could runne,
he went vnto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whereas he sound the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
his father, with all his knights in a readinesse to goe
foorth, if néed should require. And at his comming thether,
he declared vnto him in what point and estate the battaile
remained, and in the ende he saide, that considering in how
much he was bound vnto the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> and the great
loue that he bare vnto those christians that came with him,
dyd constraine him that with all the power possible that he
could make, for to goe and succour him, for to saue the king
<hi>Oliuerio</hi> from death, and a great number of valiant and
worthie knights that were at the point to be slaine. Then
the Emperour who was no lesse endued with excelent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
then his sonne, aunswered him as followeth.</p>
               <p>That he should ordaine and doe all at his owne will and
pleasure, for that therein he should receiue great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>At which words <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Alamades,</hi> were verie glad &amp; ioyful, for whatsoeuer damage

alow the great courage of <hi>Rosicleer.</hi> Then straight waies
and in great hast, issued out of the citie, the Emperour <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio,</hi>
and carryed in his companie all that valiant crue of
knights, with thirtie thousand other knights, all Gréekes,
galopping with their horses, keping very good aray and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they came into the fielde whereas the battaile was, and
when they saw that all the campe of the king <hi>Oliuerio</hi> wer
dispersed and out of all order and aray, running some one
way, and some an other way, and all those worthy princes
of the whole hoast, were compassed round about with theyr
enimies, and put in great ieoperdie, and at the point for to
lose their liues, without any hope of ayde and succour for
to deliuer them. At which time the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi>
&amp; all those valiant knights that came with him, with great
furie and force, put themselues in the middest amongst the
Pagans, that again the whole field was couered with dead
bodies, and it séemed that all the furie of the world came
there together, for on the one part went <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> the king
<hi>Sacridoro,</hi> the Tartarian <hi>Zoylo, Bargandel, Liriamandro,</hi>
and other valiant and worthie knights, that all they found
before them, they slew and ouerthrew to the ground: and on
the other side went the good Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and with
him the stout <hi>Florion,</hi> the Prince <hi>Brandizel, Clauerindo,</hi>
and the valiant and strong <hi>Oristedes,</hi> and the good knight
<hi>Flamides,</hi> making so great slaughter on their enimies, that
they were all dyed in bloud. And the desire which the good
knight <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> had to kill Pagans, that they which were
with him, were not able to kepe him companie, but all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
he pressed forwards and put himselfe amongst his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
doing such wonders, that ther was not one that could
resist him. And as he pressed thus forwards, he came where
as he saw a great number of Pagan knights gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in maner of a ring, and had in the middest amongst
them, fiue knights all on foote, verie valiantly defending
themselues with their swords in their hands, but their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
were so manie that charged them, that before his
face, thrée of those knights fell downe vnto the ground, as
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13995:117"/>
though they had bene dead, and the other two were so wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that their deathes were at hand. And as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rew nigh
vnto them, he saw that one of the two knights that defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themselues was the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> and the other <hi>Don
Siluerio,</hi> whome he might very wel know by their armour,
and tokens which they had, when he saw them first enter
into the battaile, and those who had compassed them about
was the king of <hi>Bartos,</hi> and the king of the <hi>Arrianos,</hi> and
had crownes of golde vpon their healmes, with more then
fiftie knights that were about those two knights, and none
nigh for to succour and take their parts. The which being
seene by <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> with great furie, he put himselfe amongst
those companie of Pagans, killing and ouerthrowing all
that was in his waye, and with his sword in his hand hée
came whereas the two kings were, and stroke one of them
such a blowe vppon his righte shoulder, that the whole
arme with part of his backe he ouerthrew to the ground,
and stroke the other such an other blow vpon the head, that
cleauing the Crowne of gold and the Healme, he cut him
downe to the throate, so that these two kings fell downe
dead to the ground, and their horses which were verie good,
remained without maisters. And for that the king <hi>Oliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi>
and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Prince might haue leasure to mount vpon those
horses, <hi>Rosicleer</hi> began to charge them with so many &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
blowes, that the most part of them that were there to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
he slew with his owne handes, and the rest which
remained, for feare of death, ranne away, but the king and
the prince were so wearie, that they had no power to mount
vpon those horses, for the which <hi>Rosicleer</hi> alighted with a
trice, and tooke the king in his armes with so great ease, as
if he had bene a childe, and set him vpon his owne horse,
saying, take and receiue this seruice of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> in token
of a great deale more that he doth desire to serue you, the
which being saide, he retourned vnto <hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> and in
the same order as he did vnto the king, he set him vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
of the horses of the Pagan kings, and he with a trice moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vpon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> other, striking mortal blowes vpon his enimies,
<pb facs="tcp:13995:118"/>
he departed from that place, leauing the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> and
<hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> verie greatly amazed at that which he hadde
done for them, and how he shewed himselfe to be on their
part. Also they were verie glad and ioyful to sée themselues
deliuered from the death which they thought verelie there
to haue receiued.</p>
               <p>At that time the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> remembred the wordes
which the wise <hi>Artemidoro,</hi> had sayd vnto him, when that
in London he carryed vnto him the gentleman <hi>Rosicleer,</hi>
for to be an armed knight at his hands, which was, that the
time should come, that he should more estéeme to haue him
by his side, then any thing in all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whole world, the which
wordes were there accomplished, in that he cléerely deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him from death. From that place the king &amp; the prince
<hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> did behold the battaile, and were verie much
amazed to sée how the Christians had the better hand of the
battaile, and that ther were so many and so good knights in
their fauour, ayde, and succour.</p>
               <p>At this time the battaile was so ioyned and knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that if the night had not bene so nigh at hand, it semed
that their determination was all to be slaine at that insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
for that, although on the part of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi>
there were so valiant and worthie knights that were able
for to ouercome a mightie armie, yet on the other part was
those two Pagans, <hi>Bradaman Campion,</hi> and <hi>Bramarant,</hi>
that dyd so great destruction on their aduersaries, that it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that there remained not one before them whereas they

in their gard and kéeping, staying so many of their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that they were all stained in bloud, and made great
way whereas they went. Likewise there was that stout
knight <hi>Rodaran,</hi> and the king of <hi>Media,</hi> with other valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
kings and knights Pagans, which did great harme vppon
their aduersaries: and although those dyd so worthely on
their parts, so likewise did those valiant knights on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> part
of the good Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> so much harme on their
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:13995:118"/>
enimies, that the Pagans bagan to lose ground by little and
little. And as the worthie <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> went discouering and
ranging throughout the battaile, he by fortune met with
the <hi>Gran Campion,</hi> who was all alone, slaying and killing
all that euer was before him, &amp; c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mming vnto him he stroke
him so cruell and strong a blow vpon the wast, that he had
parted him in two péeces, if it had not bene for his good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
which was such, that his good sword could not enter
into it, yet for all that, the blow did so bruse and crush his
bones and flesh, in such sort, that <hi>Bradaman</hi> felt that blow
not to be like vnto the blowes giuen by other knightes,
which was the occasion that with great furie he turned
himselfe about, and repaide the same with an other like,
vppon his shoulder, that he had ouerthrowen him to the
ground, if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he had not embrased himselfe about his horse
necke: then began these two to strike the one vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other
very strongly, and the battaile betwixt them endured till
the closing vp of the night, when that they could not know
the one from the other: then the Pagans began to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themselues a part, and these two knights were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to part the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, but <hi>Bradaman,</hi> went away with
so great anger &amp; that one alone knight should make
him so strong resistance, that no one of all his men durst
come into his presence.</p>
               <p>At this time came more then one hundreth thousands
Pagans, which the Emperour <hi>Alicandro,</hi> did send a fresh,
after that it was tolde him that much people had issued out
of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but their comming was to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
for that it was night, all the troupes of the Pagans
were retyred, and méeting the one with the other, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
vnto their trenches, there to take their ease vntill
the day following, for that they ment to encounter with
their enimies with a fresh supplie.</p>
               <p>Then the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> for to retire all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
dyd sound his horne, the which he alwaies carryed with
him, like a good Captaine, (at the time of warre) at which
sound, all the Gréekes assembled together, and leauing a
<pb facs="tcp:13995:119"/>
part the king <hi>Oliuerio</hi> aud all his people in good order, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned
vnto the Citie with all that noble crew of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
whereas they were receiued with great ioye and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Empresse <hi>Briana,</hi> and of the farie <hi>Oliuia,</hi> who
did not a little reioyce when that she vnderstood what <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi>
had done for the king her father, and it séemed vnto
her that it was a good meane to obtaine friendship, which
was at that time, the thing that the most desired, and to the
contrarie, it was a great griefe &amp; corasiue vnto her heart,
that betwéene the king <hi>Oliuerio</hi> and her spouse <hi>Rosicleer,</hi>
should passe any contention or euil wil. Thus leauing them
the Historie doth returne vnto the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
his people together, sound that he lacked more then
the halfe of those he brought into Grecia: likewise, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
great fiers to be made, at the light whereof he
pitched his tents, and made his trenches verie nigh vnto
the citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whereas it was giuen him to
vnderstand that all the people with whome his armie had
the battaile with, were Pagans, and were come into Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia
against the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and of the great power
that the Emperour <hi>Alicandro</hi> had there, and how for that
he thought that they were come thether in fauour of the
Gréekes, he sent out his knights for to giue them battaile.
But when that king <hi>Oliuerio</hi> and <hi>Don Siluerio</hi> vnderstood
the trueth thereof, with verie anger and fretting, they were
ouercome, and requested the death, for that on the one part
they saw the most part of their knights destroyed, and the
power of the Pagans deminished, the which if that it had
not so fallen out, the reuengement of the Emperour <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio,</hi>
had bene verie certaine. But that which greued them
most, was that which <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did for them, and how much
they were bound vnto him, for deliuering of them from
death, and it seemed vnto them to be such a byt to withdraw
them from their wills and desires to make their reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
determined before they came foorth out of their owne
countries, who with great confusion and verie pensiue, in
thinking what was best to be done, they passed away that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:13995:119"/>
night in their trenches, and commaunded good watch to be
kept, till the next day, wherein passed many things, as shal

for that which had passed with the host of

the one against the other in battaile, which
was not a little profit vnto them, for by that meanes his
enimies were lessened more then one hundreth thousand.
The next day following after the battaile, when that both
the hosts, that of the Emperour <hi>Alicandro,</hi> and that of the
king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> were both in sight of the Citie of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>

was to procure friendship with the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> onely for
the great good will which he bare vnto his welbeloued
princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> &amp; also for that in the which he was bound
vnto him, for the great friendship receiued at such time as
he was in great Britaine. And with this determination,
he did apparell himselfe with the ritchest garments and
robes that was possible, &amp; likewise the princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> &amp; the
Quéene <hi>Arquirosa,</hi> in the most gallantest maner that they
could. Then after that he had conference with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

Emperour and the Empresse with all those valiant kings,
Princes, and knights, did behold them, and a new they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to meruaile to behold their great beauties and gallant
dispositions. And as it hath bene declared vnto you before
in this Historie, that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was of a high stature, and
well proporcioned of his bodie according vnto his height,
for that continually vnto that time, he did encrease daylie
more &amp; more, as well in the one as in the other, and ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with this his face was perfect and well proporcioned,
verie white and faire, and of a merrie couutenaunce, and
there was none that did behold him, but had a great delight
to sée him: he was at that time apparailed in a Iacket of
cloth of golde, garnished round about with a great number
of precious stones, and a hat vpon his head after the Gréeke
fashion, full of verie fine Rubies and Diamonds, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
no other weapon with him but that precious sworde
of the Quéene <hi>Iulia,</hi> at his girdle, which was suteable vnto
the apparell he ware, for that the scabbert was garnished
with gold and precious stones, he was mounted vpon a big
and lustie horse, all baye, sauing he was full of black spots,
which became him verie well, and being in this maner on
horse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

they tooke their leave of the Emperour &amp; of the Empresse,
and departed out of that mightie pallas, being accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with all those mightie and valiqnt Princes and Knights,
till such time as they came into the fielde out of the
Citie, whereas at the request of <hi>Rosicler,</hi> they all retourned back
againe, and they thrée alone wont toward the compe of the
king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> being verie much looked at of at the people
of the citie, and with no lesse admiration they were looked

doe nothing but behold them, and abyde the time to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

               <p>When they were come vnto the camp, they asked which
was the tent of the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> and being shewed by a

be done in their affaires: but when they saw them &amp; knew
<hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and the Princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> all apparailed after so
gallant a sort, they were wonderfully amazed, and were si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to heare what should be their demand. There was no
mouing amongst them till such time as <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from his horse, who straight waies alighted y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> princesse
<hi>Oliuia,</hi> and the quéene <hi>Arquirosa,</hi> and taking them both by
the hands they entred into the tent, then the king and all
that were with him did arise from their seates, and dyd sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
the one the other, with such courtesie as appertained
vnto so high persons: and although that <hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> was
greatly amazed and his bloud did rise when that he saw the
princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> yet when that he saw her in the power of
<hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and considering the great reason she had therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
he dyd not let to haue a great regard vnto the Quéene
<hi>Arquirosa,</hi> and liked very well of her, and said with in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that next vnto the princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> she was the fairest
gentlewoman that euer he saw in all his life, and greatlie
desired to know what she should be. His desire was quickly
accomplished, for that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> putting himselfe before the
king, hauing the princes &amp; the Quéene by their hands, said.</p>
               <p>HIgh king of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> I will not call you migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
(for that according vnto the opinion of wise men)
there is none amongst mortall men can attaine to so
glorious a name, sauing alonely he may call himselfe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that is Lorde and gouernour ouer men, and hath the
power of all fortunes, he at whose will the Heauens doth
<pb facs="tcp:13995:121"/>
moue, the windes doth blow, the waters of the sea doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
and rage, and by him the earth with all beasts &amp; plants
are sustained: Here I doe giue you the name of high, for
that séeing your selfe in what estate you are in, you may
know how perilous and slipper it is, and how readie you
are and open vnto the thundering blowes of fortune. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things doth men begin and put in vre, who cannot bring
it to passe as they would, and according vnto their mindes,
but in the ende it finisheth cleane contrarie vnto their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
and this procedeth onely for that it is in theyr
hands to begin them, and in the power of God to giue the
conclusion vnto his pleasure. Our hearts he valiant and
couragious, for to attempt against all the whole world, and
doe not consider and sée that humaine force is so féeble and
weake, that one little and hidden euill, doth ouercome it, and
whatsoeuer blow of fortune doth ouerthrow it. This we
ought to haue alwaies in our remembraunce, because we
should not put our selues in difficult things, for that if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it doth not fall out according vnto our mindes, then
should we not haue any occasion for to be angrie, neither
reason for to complaine vs of fortune, for that the whole
fault is in our selues, and with more reason we may be
angery with our selues. You doe well vnderstand how that
the Prince <hi>Edward</hi> your sonne with fortie thousand good
knights of great Britaine, came into Hungaria, with what
intent. I doe not iudge, but according as it was notorious
and manifest vnto all, he came for to destroy the Emperour
my father, &amp; for to make the king of Hungaria Lord ouer
all Grecia, and for that this was an attempt as vniust as
difficult, it was in his hands to begin the same, but in the
hands of him that hath power ouer all, to conclude the ende
according vnto his will. If the Emperour my father was
to be blamed herein, iudge you, and then sée if there be anie
reason for him to make restitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whome fortune would
seme fauourable: but now let that goe, for that I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue
you are certified. And touching the marriage which

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:13995:121"/>
will giue you to vnderstand, that if you doe well consider
and looke into all these things passed, then should you verie
manifestlie and cléerelie sée, that it is not for anie iniurie
towards you, but that the diuine prouidence hath ordained
the same for to euitate and cut off the great griefe and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
euils that were looked for betwéene my father and
you, for séeing that the harme was committed, there was
no other meanes for to recouer and make friendship againe,
but onelie by this marriage betwixt vs, by the which my
father doth claime of you kindred, and you may receiue mée
as your owne naturall sonne, and séeing that this hath ben
ordained by the diuine prouidence, who is he that shoulde
grant me this inclination, to haue so great a desire as I had
for to goe into great <hi>Britaine,</hi> being in such delightes, ioye,

Consider with how much honour, (you n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Lusitania</hi> who found himselfe present at the sport, and can
saie that the resistance was not made by anie humane force
and strength, for that being but fiue knights, we alone did
defend our selues so long time against so great a fléete of
ships and men. Likewise hée can declare of the great mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="tcp:13995:122"/>
in the aide and succour that came vnto vs in that great

onelie because you shall vnderstand that all doth procéede
from aboue, and that it is Gods will, that this marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
me and the Princesse shall be the occasion for to eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and take awaie all these inconueniences which are loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

all that is past, &amp; do you not thinke that this wil bée an euil
meane for things past, besides, as now the doing thereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be restrained, and many times, as héeretofore hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len

aske the question of <hi>Caesar Augustus,</hi> and hée will saie that
there was neuer sonne to true and trustie vnto his Father,
as was vnto him <hi>Marcus Agrippa</hi> his sonne in law. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

constraine his heart to like verie well of the one &amp; to loue

to aske him pardon &amp; forgiuenesse, not mistrusting his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

that God had giuen vnto him in his place that valyaunt
Prince and knight. Thus hauing his minde occupied in

speake, because the greatest part of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> matter did touch him,
and till such time as he did knew his will, he thought it not
good to vtter his iudgement, which was the occasion that he
did importune him verie much to make the first answere
as he thought best, who after such time as the Quéene ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into the tent, was continuallie with great attention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding

<pb facs="tcp:13995:124"/>

in séeing that without anie demand or asking, he
offered vnto him so high a Ladie and damsell for wife, &amp; had
cleane forgotten all the anger and wrath that he had before
conceiued and taken against <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> with the friendship
receiued of him the daie before in deliuering of them from
death. So perceiuing that the king would not answere in
anie respect till such time as he had vittered his minde, hée
spake these wordes following.</p>
               <p>HIgh and worthie Prince of <hi>Grecia,</hi> of all that you haue
héere so highlie declared, as also of all other things that
haue so prosperouslie fallen out on your part, I do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
no other thing but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> God hath created you amongst
all Princes the most highest, &amp; amongst al knights the most
noblest, and in strength the most stoutest, &amp; amongest men
of vnderstanding the most wisest, and aboue all fortune hath
shewed her selfe fauourable and prosperous, for whosoeuer
doth consider the highnesse of your estate, shall plainlie sée &amp;
perceiue that there is none that commeth nigh vnto you, &amp;
for worthinesse, none equall, and to consider of your high
knighthood, they shall see that it is without comparison, and
almost aboue nature, likewise considering how prosperous
all things hath fallen out on your part, they will not onelie
saie that fortune is fauourable vnto you, but also that you
haue her at commandement to do al things at your pleasure,
and séeing that you haue so many and high things on your
side, what enimie is there that will resist you, or friend that
will loose your friendship. The wise man saith, that there
are thrée things which ought to be feared: the waues of the
sea, the thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbolts of the heauens, &amp; the furious wild beasts
on the earth: but yet aboue all things (he saith) ought to bée
feared, the enimie prosperous &amp; fortunable, for that he which
doth not nauigate at the Sea, is out of all daunger of the
waues, and he that kéepeth his house, is out of the danger of
wilde beasts, and the thunderbolts verie seldome strikath,
but from the prosperous enimie, there is none that can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte
himselfe, neither can he finde anie place whether<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

runne, for whereas he thinketh himselfe most surest, many
times it falleth out, that there is most perill, and héere I say
that fortune hath shewed her selfe more prosperous vnto you
than vnto anie, and vnto me more contrarie than vnto anie
other, for that she did not content her selfe in giuing you
the victorie ouer me, but the more to cralt you, shée brought
me into that extremitie, that of necessitie I must be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, and receiue life at your hands, the which you
gaue mée as a friend, whereby you got of mee the greatest
victorie that euer man had of his enimie. Therefore God
forbid that now I should haue anie enmitie with him, who
with the great force and strength of your arme dyd ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

will bée the occasion that I shall conclude friendship with
you, yet God who doth know the secrets of all things, I doe
take to witnesse, that I am not constrained by loue to take

               <p>Oh my welbeloued children, God forbidde that in mée

and will not haue, neither do I looke for anie other content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

he is a good witnesse therevnto, that I came not forth out
of great <hi>Britaine</hi> with so great a multitude of knightes for
anie euill will that I had, but for to accomplish that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I was bound vnto the Prince <hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> and now

and the one receiued the other with so great loue, and with
such excéeding courtesie, as commonlie is vsed betwixt so

eight, it doth well appeare, that although they haue proued
the force and strength of some of these knights, yet doe they
not knowe the valiantnesse of their hearts. Thou shalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

to haue séene those his meruailous workes, if that in their

comming for to see thée, as it is manifest vnto thee, yet I
doe say, that if there were no other occasion, this should bee
sufficient for to come and see thée. The great care which hath
ben the occasion of my comming hether, (although I doe
beléeue that thou doest know it) yet will I declare it vnto
thée, for that he that loued so faithfully and firmely in his
time, will not meruaile at any force whatsoeuer it be that
loue doth vpon humaine hearts. I loue the knight of the
Sunne aboue all other things in this world, so that if my
fortune and euill destenie doe permit that he take an other
to be his wife, I desire to know the trueth thereof, for that
I may remember my selfe, &amp; take order what is best to be
done. It hath bene told mée that he is made sure vnto the
princesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> and that he loued her with all his
heart, therefore (for that there is nothing hid from thée) I
doe desire thée for to tell mée if it be true, and put me out
of all doubt, for whatsoeuer that thou shalt tell mée, I shall
beléeue it to be true, and conformable therevnto I wil take

<pb facs="tcp:13995:132"/>
the sight of those my workes: much more may I thinke
these my trauailes better imployed, the which I had in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of them. I being now gratified with so high a reward,
in that you are come for to sée them. And I doe not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
that loue hath had so great power for to ouercome
your highnesse, for that alwaies against the most highest &amp;
most worthiest of courage, there doth he vse the greatest
force, but in especiall with the knight of the Sunne, for
that his fortune and destinie doth promise him vnto you, as
vnto her that in all the whole world doth best deserue him,
and for you alone is he kept and defended. And touching
the trueth of this which you haue demaunded of mée, I tell
you, that the knight of the Sunne was neuer made sure
vnto the princesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> neither hath he hadde any
more to doe with her then he hath had with you, although
the great and mightie Emperour <hi>Alicandro</hi> her father dyd
giue her to him for wife, and left vnto him his high &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Empire of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> with an infinite number of other
kingedomes, with the which he should be made the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
prince and lord in all the whole world. And for that he
would not receiue her and all the rest, cleane contrarie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his will, secretly in the night he departed and left the
<hi>gran Cataia,</hi> almost distract of their wits, with great desire
for to enioye the sight of your soueraigntie, the which time
he thought long, and after he came to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and
had that rigorous battaile with you, the which contencion
was so cruell vnto him, after that he knew you, that despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and wearie of his life, he would goe seeke his death, to
cléere himselfe out of this worlde. So he departed out of
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> and went into the wildernesse of <hi>Grecia,</hi>
whereas he had battaile with one of the most valiantest
and stoutest Pagans that was in all the Paganisme, and
yet in all that rigorous battaile, he would neuer strike him
with his sworde, for that he hadde smitten you with the
same.</p>
               <p>And from thence he departed and went to sea, whereas
by a rough &amp; great tempest, he was driuen vnto the Iland
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13995:132"/>
of the diuelish <hi>Fauno,</hi> where (as one desirous to dye and
receiue the death) he went a shore, and had a meruailous
battaile with two legious of infernall diuels, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with the diuelish <hi>Fauno,</hi> wherein happened verie
strange things, as is apparant if you please to goe thether
to sée, where you shall finde him all alone, without anie
other companie, more then his horse, neither is there in all
the Iland any other beast or foule.</p>
               <p>There doth he leade and passe the most sharpest and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest
life that euer was holden by man, with desire there
to ende his dayes, and neuer more to retourne and weare
armour. All this he doth for your occasion, and you are in a
great fault before God, if you doe not finde remedie in the
recouering of him againe, for that by your occasion there
doth languish and dye, the best and worthiest knight in all
the whole world, and one that doth loue you better then
any thing therein: therefore it doth accomplish your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
out of hand to goe and sée him, for it is so that if your
succour doe stay long, it may so fall out that after he shall
haue no néede thereof, for that at this present his life is in
great perill.</p>
               <p>In concluding of these words, the wise <hi>Artidon</hi> closed
his eyes againe, &amp; did put himselfe as he was before, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
aunswering or speaking any word, leauing the royall
princes one way with so great ioy and pleasure, that she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
knew not her selfe, her comfort was so great, and an
other way with great sorow, repenting her selfe of that
which she hadde done against the most worthie knight
of the Sunne, and blamed her selfe verie much, in that
she sawe not any further proofe of his disloyaltie, and giuing
him so malicious and euill reward, for the great good loue
and often perills which he aduentured for her sake, and dyd
thinke the tyme very long, till she departed for to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie

               <p>Moreouer, she toke her leaue of the wise man, &amp; he made

that they desired. The knight was her true and faithfull lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
so that <hi>Elizea</hi> departed from thence with great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and satisfied of his loyaltie, they were not so soone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted

was such: but being forth of that wonderfull and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

they came a shore. And at their comming thether, the
princes would haue informed her selfe where the ylande of
the diuelish <hi>Eauno</hi> was, she found many that did giue her

reason of the great fame that was spread abroade thereof,

whereby she might take her direct course thether, which
caused a great desire in her heart to commit her selfe vnto

and her knight, accompanieng her selfe with alonelie
two damsels, with whome she ment to enter into the ship,
with determination not to come any more a shore, till such

and giueing <hi>Elizea</hi> to vnderstand hereof, she was very sad
and sorowfull so for to lose her companie, for that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
themselues happie and fortunate to be in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie:
but when they vnderstoode that it was her will and
desire, with many teares shed, of her and her knight, they
toke their leaue of her, alwaies hauing in minde in how
much they were bound vnto her, for that she deliuered them
out of prison from that mightie and famous Rouer <hi>Cleoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</hi>
The princes being departed from them, she commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her selfe vnto fortune, &amp; began to make saile, hauing no

would that they might nauigate with the more force, all

               <p>LORD if it be thy blessed will that I shall sée againe
the knight of the Sunne, I doe verely beleue, that this
tempest commeth by thy prouidence and apointment, for
that this my Shippe being forced by the furie of these
baysterous windes, I may the soner come vnto the place
whereas he is. And if it be so Lord, (as vnworthie) thou
hast not heard my prayer and petition, but that all things
doth worke according vnto their nature: yet héere I doe
desire thy diuine maiestie, for that it is in thy power, to stay
the celestial powers, in such sort, that they may not disturbe
mée in this my iourneie, nor bée contrarie vnto mée.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13995:135"/>
And I am fully perswaded Lord, that if it were thy will
that I should die before that I doe sée y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> knight of the Sun,
it were not néedefull the force of the Elements, nor the
noyse of so great thundering and lightening for to kill mée,
for alonely thy will is sufficient for to sinke this my ship
downe to the center of the sea. And againe, if it be thy wil
that I shalbe saued, then wherefore should I feare fortunes
tempestes, or the force of the great and furious waues? the
good Prophet was in greater peril, when that he was swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vp by the mightie whale, and the mightie Apostle in
the deapth of the sea, and for that it was thy will for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
them, those perills did little trouble them. The wrath
and yre of <hi>Esau</hi> did little profit against <hi>Iacob,</hi> nor that of
the <hi>Chaldes</hi> against <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor that of <hi>Pharao</hi> against
thy people, nor that of <hi>Holophernus</hi> against <hi>Iudith,</hi> nor
that of the Lyons against <hi>Daniel,</hi> and little can this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest

as thou diddest deliuer them. So in saying these words,
the royall Princes it séemed vnto her that the storme en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
more and more, and so dyd all that day &amp; the night
following, without any hope of calmenesse: The next day
in the morning, whether it was by the will of God, for that
his pleasure was that the troubles &amp; sorowes of the knight
of the Sunne should haue ende, or whether it was by arte
of the wise <hi>Lirgandeo,</hi> I know not, but the shippe with that

returned backe againe, so that all alone with her horse and
armour, she went a shore. And being a land she was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amazed, to sée the countrie so plaine and no habitation
therein, she found it voyde of all people, and the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of certaine houses, which in times past had bene there
builded, but now ouerthrowen and fallen downe with the
wether. She saw that the Iland was very fresh &amp; gréene,
and full of trées, but not a beast nor bird she could sée in all
the Iland, but as an vnpeopled and desert place, and being
very much amazed at all this, she could not iudge otherwise

               <p>And being in this troubled thought, she saw vppon the

a boate broken all to péeces, (the which was the boate that
brought the knight of the Sunne thether, and he brake it all
to péeces, because he would haue nothing to carie him from

trappings in her hands, and wipte of the dust that was on

although that cruell Fortune and my euill destinies
would not permit and suffer that in our liues we could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye

the Princes procured for to take the horse, somewhat for to
comfort her selfe with his companie, for that the knight of
the Sunne manie times dyd ryde him, but by no meanes
she could not doe it, for that the horse was fierce and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
and would not suffer himselfe to be taken of anie
other but of his maister the knight of the Sunne, whome
he dyd visit manie times, and fedde diuerse and sundrie

as she came vnto the craggie and hard Rocke that he hadde

and vppon the toppe of the same, shee sawe where hunge
the rich sword of the knight of the Sunne, with the scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard

that he had stroke her with his swoord, yet in the time of
that great necessitie, he left the same, because he would not
defile it with any other bloud. An other, in the great and
soueraigne force and courage which he had, for to goe fight
with that diuelish <hi>Fauno,</hi> without any sword. The third,
in the great and incredible strength which he had, for to cut
and cleane that cragged and hard Rock, sheuering of such

the rewarde he receiued at her hands in recompence of the
great loue &amp; fidelitie he had borne vnto her. And the more

to knowe what was become of the knight of the Sunne,
leauing the sworde hanging whereas shee found it, shée
departed from thence, and as she trauailed for a great space
with a sodaine feare that came ouer her heart in such sorte,
that all her members shaked, that shée coulde not almost go

neither that raging and solitarie life which hée suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

that she procured to giue it him with her owne handes, hée
desired to liue no longer in this world, at least waies not in

hée went forth of the cottage whereas hée was, and went
and put himselfe vnder the shadow of a companie of thicke
trées, whereas the water of the fountaine passed by with a

fell asléepe, and béeing in this order asléepe, lying a longe
vpon the gréene hearbes, it chaunced to be the verie same
daie that the Princesse <hi>Claridiana</hi> went to séeke him, with
great sorrowe and griefe because shée could not finde him,
neither aliue nor dead, and by reason that shée went a foote,

of him round about in all partes, yet notwithstanding
her great wearinesse, the greate care that shée had at her
heart was the occasion that shée rested not till such time as
fortune brought her whereas the knight of the Sunne laie
vnder the trées in the shadow all along a sléepe, but when
shee found him whereas hée laie in that order vppon the

great abundaunce of teares which ranne downe her faire

vnto him, she remained a pretie while as in contemplation,
and could not satisfie her selfe in beholding him, for although
hee was vnarmed, and laie along vpon the harde ground,
yet dyd hée shew forth that soueraigne maiestie and graue
semblance wherewith hée was adorned, hee was apparelled
in a doublet of cloth of golde somewhat worne out, and his

a Gyant, and all his members so well proportioned, that it

as hée laie along vppon the grasse, that sure it was
a straunge thing to beholde, and the Princesse dyd neuer
vntil that daie sée him in apparaile that it better please her,
and giue her greater contentment, which was the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that shée remained there a good while beholding of him
as one greatlie astonished, and it séemed vnto her that his
shape dyd verie farre surpasse all humane vnderstanding,
<pb facs="tcp:13995:141"/>
and she sayd within her selfe that God had not created that
knight of so good a disposition for to liue in the deserts, and
how that she deserued all euill for that she was the occasion
of his sorrowe and troubles. In the meane time that shée
thus debated with himselfe, the good knight began to moue
himselfe and turned into another place, and began to distill
from his eies so greate abundaunce of teares, that it was a
griefe to beholde. Then she because she woulde not wake
him quicklie, withdrew her selfe on the one side, and stoode
behinde a trée, where she tarried to sée<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what he would doe,

séeing that she could not finde him, returned againe vnto
the Sea side, whereat he receiued so great sorrow and griefe
that he wept, and shed those teares which the Princesse, had
séene. Likewise it séemed vnto him that she was departed,
which caused in him so great anguish and griefe, that in the

crueltie, to kill him that is liuing, &amp; not him that hath time
to bewaile his death. Let it suffice thée (Loue) this great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauour
that I haue receiued at thy hands, and let it content

dreames, that the Princesse <hi>Claridiana</hi> my mistres doeth

haue anie care, sorrow, or griefe ouer me, she lifting vp the
sword with her rigorous arme for to kill me, and againe,
so high and soueraigne a Ladie shoulde come and seeke a
knight so vnfortunate and abased as I am? It may well
be said that it is a dreame, being a thing so variable and out
of all consert, and I doe now well vnderstand, that it is a
new procuration of loue to call vnto my remembraunce,
setting before mine eies that high and soueraigne glory, that
after being deceiued, and finding my selfe frustrate and not
worthie thereof, it may be the occasion that my sorrow and
griefe maye the more augment. But now (Loue) vse thy
will against me, and let fortune shew me as much crueltie
as she can, for that the crueltie of the one nor the tyrannie
of the other is sufficient for to make me to leaue off and not
for to loue the Empresse <hi>Claridiana</hi> my Ladie &amp; Mistres,
and louing her, for to suffer &amp; abide anie kinde of torment
whatsoeuer for her sake, for that the daie will come that the

               <p>In saying these wordes, the knight of the Sunne expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so great sorrow, throwing from him such profound sighs,

increase in you gentilitie and worthinesse, Sir Knight, (he

And you shall vnderstand that by the force of a greate

was, I came ashore, whereas I haue seene so many strange
things, that so long as I doe liue, I shall haue inough to do

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13995:142"/>
and you not to vse it, you shall vnderstand that God did not
giue it vnto you for your selfe alone, but also for to defend
and succour all such as hath neede thereof. Lykewise it
cannot bée without grieuous offending of the almighte
God, to cause vnto your parents so great sorrow and griefe,
alonelie for your absence, which is no lesse griefe vnto them
than the death, and for my parte heere I doe aduertise you,

for that <hi>Grecia</hi> is my naturall Countrie, in no part in all

there, the lamentations of my parents, the teares and wéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of my brethren, the complaints of my friends, the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of my subiects, all the which will be an occasion to me
of greater torment, and the griefe much more greater vnto
them, so that for to excuse all this I am determined to die
there, whereas nothing else but my sorrowful death shall be
grieuous vnto me, and there whereas I shall alwaies haue
it in memorie, and now séeing that my fortune will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

you (gentle knight) to returne againe vnto the sea vnto
your owne companie from whence you came, and let mée

               <p>Héere the Princesse could not choose but féele at her hart
verie grieuous the wordes of her knight, but of his greate
fidelitie she was verie glad and ioyfull, and had great pittie
of his sorrow and griefe, and willing to proceede in farther

that there is no damsell in the worlde, of what estate

I knowe thus much of women, that first they will consent
themselues to die burning in amorous fires, than to
make anie shew of loue vnto them that they thinke to haue
their thoughtes occupied in other partes, and so farre foorth
as I can see they haue great reason, for that the heart of a
man being set vpon more than one, there is none that hath
anie parte in him, neither can his loue with anie bée per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
the which you maye verie well iudge by your selfe, in
thinking of that which you would do, if so bee that you did
sée this to bée in her whome you at this present doe so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie
loue.</p>
               <p>Ah good knight, sayde the knight of the Sunne, this is
the hidden fire wherewith I am scorched, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the bones of this my mortall bodie doth consume.
This is that which hath me prisoner and hath inchaunted
me, and that to whom all my force and strength is yéelded,
without hauing anie other thing in mée to make anie resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
but to doe that which hée desired, and suffer with a
good will all such paines and tormentes as hée giueth mée,
estéeming much of the wound, making poison to bée sauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
bitter swéete, paine delectable, torment, ioy and pleasure,
and finallie, death to bée verie swéete and easie. And if
that loue hath shewed her selfe so cruell against mée, good
knight doe not meruaile thereat, for that, that high and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraine
Damsell, the which my fortune and destinie dyd
permit mée to loue, is of so greate valour and high desert,
that héere I doe confesse that I am not worthie of her, for
that fortune amongest humane creatures did exalt her most
highest, and nature did painte her in such sorte (that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a parte the power of God) I am perswaded that there
was to bée done no more on her. This waie hath shée bene
cruell vnto mée, and not that waie (Sir Knight) which
you haue giuen mée to vnderstand, for that shée it is alone
<pb facs="tcp:13995:144"/>
whom I loue, and my heart is fixed vppon no other but
onelie vpon her. It is not néedfull that I saie anie more

               <p>Then shée sayde, of my faith (Sir Knight) according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your wordes, and as you haue giuen mée to vnderstande
by them, it can bée no other for whome you doe suffer this
sorrow and griefe, but <hi>Claridiana,</hi> the Empresse of <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for that shée is a Damsell, as well in highnesse as in

doe iniurie mée in this which you haue sayd, for that I haue
séene her, and I doe beléeue that she hath not her equall in
the world.</p>
               <p>The great sorrow and griefe of my heart (said the knight
of the Sunne) vnto her alone I wold that it were manifest,
but for that I will not doe so great iniurie vnto so high a

                  </gap> you haue héere mentioned, and again because you
shall not saie that I lack reason in this which I haue said, I

now seeing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I haue tolde you, I most heartelie desire you,
that so long as you do liue, you keepe it secret, for that séeing
I must die for her sake, yet I would not for all the worlde
that she should be accounted culpable of my death. Now wil
I giue you to vnderstand, said the Princesse, that there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
put in all this your sorrow and griefe, and that your
fortune is much better than you did make reckoning of, for
that I doe know this damsell, and am certaine that many
daies since she hath trauailed in your demand with greate
sorrow and care for to finde you, and according vnto the
wordes which I heard, and the profound sighs which I haue
séene her vtter, I doe beléeue of certaintie, that she doth beare
you as much good loue as you doe beare vnto her, &amp; if it bée
so that you haue receiued anie disfauour or discurtesie at her

hands, it is not vnknowen, that ouer much loue many times
is the occasion of iealous thoughts conceiued against them
whom they loue, the which she might well haue, in seeing
you in companie with some other faire damsell, &amp; afterward
being certefied of your fidelitie, repented her selfe, and then
the loue which before she bare vnto you, to be a new redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in her, for that there is nothing that doth in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when that faithfullie they are certefied to the contrarie, for
then all wrath and anger is turned vnto loue, and is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
the more to augment and increase, and so it may be now
in <hi>Claridiana,</hi> that if so be that you alonelie doe loue her,
then was it not possible the truth to be hid, and now she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
repented of that which is past, it doth cause her (as I
haue tolde you) to goe in your demand, and with no other
intent but to aske you pardon for that which is past, the
which you ought out of hand for to pardon, and to go &amp; séeke
her, for that there is nothing more worthie to be pardoned,
than those errours which are committed by ouer much lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
Then he said: Ah sir knight, tell me I praie you where
you did see my Ladie and mistres the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi>
and how you doe vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> she trauaileth in my demand,
for that of truth if it be true, I wil presentlie depart and go
séeke her vnto the worlds end, onelie for to sée her, wherein
there shall bée no man in all the worlde so happie as I. I
will tell you how I doe know it, said the Empresse, for that
it is not many daies since that I saw her, and if thou wilt
that I shal tell thée true, not many hours, and you shal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that yesterdaie shée ariued in this Iland in your

doe beléeue that that is shée that commeth yonder. This she
sayd, pointing with her hand towards one part of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
that waies which shée came. Then the knight of the
Sunne all amazed and ameruailed, as of a thing in mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
and impossible, did looke towards that part, in the meane
time the Princesse pulled her gantlets fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her white hands,
and tooke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:13995:145"/>
which séemed to be skaines of golde spread abrode vpon her
shoulders, of so great length, that it reached vnto the ground,
and shewed forth that faire face with so great strangenesse
and maiestie, that there was nothing in the worlde that
might bée compared therevnto, and the more her beautie
shewed for that shée was hot in trauailing a foote, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whereof her coulour was in her face, and it séemed in
the middest of her white chéeks to be two fragrant red Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
her faire and rowling eies glistered like vnto two verie
fine and greate Emerodes, glittering with a gréene cléere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
in so profound wise, that in them it might be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
sayd, whosoeuer did beholde them, to bée conuerted into
stones, for that all humane vnderstanding they did amaze
and leaue as astonied. But to conclude, the soueraigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
in all pointes séemed rather to bée a diuine thing than
humane, but the knight of the Sunne, who with great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was looking towardes that place whereas shée tolde
him that shée was comming, had not as yet seene the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
in that order, till within a while after, séeing that hée
could sée no bodie comming, hée tourned his head about for
to aske the Knight where hée hadde séene and lefte her,
but when he sawe her healme off, and knewe her by her
fayre face, it cannot bée sayde and tolde what that worthie
knight at that instant felt within himselfe, but remayned
wonderfullie amazed, and meruailing more than anie man
in the worlde, without anie power to speake one worde,
neither mooued hée anie eie lidde, but stoode still beholding
that seraphicall face, out of the which he receiued so many
dazeling sightes and glittering cléerenesse, as though he had
continuallie looked vpon the Sunne in the morning, at such
time as he spreadeth his golden beames abroade vpon the

               <p>Then the royall Princesse séeing him in that greate

loue which I did beare you, and your troubles and sorowes
hath grieued mée as much, and gone as nigh my heart,
as mine hath bene vnto you, in such sort, that if God of his
infinit mercie and goodnesse had not permitted mée to finde
you here, of trueth I doe tell you, that I would neuer haue
departed from hence aliue, for that I was determined to
ende my dayes, leading the most strictest &amp; sorowfull life
that might be immagined, in recompence of my great error,
In the meane time that the Princes spake these words, the
knight of the Sunne receiued so great ioye and pleasure, in
séeing him in the presence of his so desired mistresse, that he
embrased her, excusing himselfe with such amorous &amp; swéet
words, that he thought himselfe transported into an other
world, and knew not whether he was in heauen or on the
earth. And comming vnto himselfe after that he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that curtesie at her hands, knéeling downe before her,
he tooke and kissed her lilie white hande perforce, receiuing
thereby more glorie, then if he had bene made Lord ouer all
the world. Then the Princes a new, did embrace him, and
almost by force, dyd cause him to arise, saying, your highnes
(worthie Prince) doth not consent, that you vse with anie
this courtesie, much lesse with mée, that am whollie yours,
Then the good knight said, ah mistresse, as you are all one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
she in all the world (next vnto God) that may shew me
courtesie, so haue you now this my mortall bodie glad, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and happie: I am not onely bound vnto you to kisse
your hands, but if so be that the great loue which I beare
vnto you doe not deserue it, then is not my high estate suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
that I deserue to enioye so great courtesie, and héere
in I doe receiue so great glorie, that if continuallye I may

all highnes and royall estates, and liue and leade my

lyfe here, with as great ioye and pleasure in your companie
better then in any royall pallace, and thinke my selfe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
to be in eternall Paradise.</p>
               <p>I would to God (replyed the Princes) that with our
honors and emperial states, we might accomplish the same,
leading our liues here together in this solitarie Iland, for
that for my pleasure and contentment, I request no other
thing, but onely the enioying of your companie, in place
whereas I might not be desturbed one minute of an houre,
but for that fortune hath exalted vs vnto so high estate, and
that God hath not created vs with so great callings, onely
to serue our selues, but we must (as we are bound) accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
and performe our duties to our subiects, and goe and
sustaine our emperiall estates, and in especially you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
so excelent parentage, you are the more bound for to
goe and see them, and to take from them by your presence,
the great and long heauinesse which they haue receiued by
your absence.</p>
               <p>Then the good knight saide, Mistresse, I doe receiue so
great ioye and contentment of heart, onely in beholding of
you, that as the happie saints vnto whome the losse of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
nor any worldly thing can cause them to féele anie
paine, sorow, and griefe: euen so I being in your presence,
there is no absence, nor any other thing, that can giue or
cause vnto mée, sorow and griefe, but yet for all this, vse
you your will and discretion, for that I haue no will, but
whereas is yours.</p>
               <p>These and many other mo amorous words passed bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
these two true and perfect louers, and yet could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them manifest entirely, the great ioye and pleasure
the which they receiued at their hearts. After a while that
they had passed the tune in this their ioyfull méeting, they
sate themselues downe vpon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gréene grasse, in the shadow
vnder those huge and mightie trées, whereas with swéete
words, &amp; still more amorous then eloquent, they discoursed
the one with the other, of all thinges that hadde happened
vnto them, since their departure out of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13995:146"/>
the princes did giue the knight of the Sunne to vnderstand
the occasion why and wherefore, she made battaile with
him, and how much sorow and griefe the supition thereof
dyd cause vnto her, and how and in what sort she was put
out of all doubt concerning the same. Likewise she tolde
him of all the great preparation to the warres which was
made in Grecia, at her departure, and how she vnderstoode
that all the whole Paganisme, and a great part of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
came against the emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> for which cause
he dyd put himselfe in a redinesse to receiue them, and was
verie sad and sorowfull for his absence: all which when the
knight of the Sunne vnderstood, he straight waies had a
great desire to be in Grecia, séeming that in time of so great
necessitie, there was no reason that he should be absent, in
especiall for that the chiefest occasion and greatest part of
those warres were for his sake.</p>
               <p>Being in this communication, they could not be certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the one to heare the other, they saw comming towardes
them two damsells, vpon two palfraies, whome the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
dyd straight wayes know to be her Damsells, whome
she left in the shippe, and being greatly amazed that the
princes taryed so long and not retourned, came a land, and
went in her demaunde, with great sorow and heauines,
because they could not finde her: but when they sawe her
and knew the knight of the Sunne, they were wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
glad, as well for the ioye which theyr mistresse receiued
therein, as also for the strange things which they had séene
in that Iland. And surely they were verie sad, thinking
that the knight of the Sunne hadde bene dead, because he
had not bene heard of a long time.</p>
               <p>When these two Damsells came vnto them, they left &amp;
ceased their amorus communication, and receiued them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
courteously. Presently vppon the gréene grasse they dyd
eate of such vittailes as the Damsels had brought a shore
from the ship, for their Ladie &amp; mistresse, whereas y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> knight
of the Sunne, with the great ioye and pleasure that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
at his heart, the coulour and semblant of his face
<pb facs="tcp:13995:147"/>
was chaunsed, so that he séemed an other maner of man, and
shewed the true and perfect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>perfection in coulour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
the which nature had wrought in him. And the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for to sée him in that sort was so glad &amp; ioyful, that ther
was no pleasure that might be compared vnto hers. After
that they had eaten &amp; well refreshed themselues, the knight
of the Sunne séeing his good horse <hi>Cornerino</hi> in companie
with that of the Princesse, he lured, and straight waies he
came vnto him, for that he had vsed him therevnto, so he
tooke him, and after that, that of the Princes, and being both
desirous to depart from thence, they tooke each other by the
hande and went vnto the place whereas the knight of the
Sunne had left his good armour, &amp; there he armed himselfe
againe with them, being holpen by the princes, for that her
Damsells, with the great feare which they had of the diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<hi>Fauno,</hi> the which was dead, durst not come nigh them.
And the knight of the Sunne, séeing him so fauoured and
holpen by the hands of his Ladie and mistresse, was in that
case that he knew not whether he was in heauen or vppon
the earth, and being in this glorie, readie for to depart out
of the solitarie Iland, the Historie doth leaue them, till time

<hi>Rosicleer,</hi> thinking in a short space to hew him to

thrée thinges in this battaile cleane contrarie, which was
the occasion that hée coulde not execute his furious and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie
desire: the one, the great lightnesse that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> had,
that béeing on foote his Brother the knight of the Sunne
had no aduauntage on him, so that it was a great meruaile,
for the <hi>gran Campion</hi> to fasten a blowe vppon him in anie
respect, the other was the finenesse of his armour, which
was made by the wise <hi>Artemidoro</hi> of so great valour, that
no humane force, nor edge of anie sword was sufficient for
to cut or buckle them, the third was the great dexteritie and
strength wherewith <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did strike him, and so thicke,
that he did not let him rest one minute of an houre, neyther
gaue him anie aduauntage for to profit himselfe of his great

yet could hée not with so great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for that <hi>Bradaman</hi> after that hée had the battaile with the

verie strong and inchaunted armour, and it was so excéeding
good, that the good swoorde of the Quéene <hi>Iulia</hi> was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by anie meanes to cut it, and besides this, his blowes
were so strong and heauie, that when so euer he chaunced
to strike a full blowe vppon him, hée made him to stoupe
with his knées and handes vnto the ground, and hée had as
much care for to cléere himselfe from his terrible blowes, as
he had for to strike him, so that the battaile betwéene them

that it was strange to beholde: so that the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
was so strong and well foughten of euery part, that
one whole houre was passed, and there was no aduauntage
knowen nor séene of any part, amongst them, and the great

that they did. Amongst them all their blowes were terrible,
but in especiall those valiant Princes <hi>Meridian,</hi> and <hi>Claue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindo,</hi>
who with so great furie did strike their blowes, that
many times they were both astonied, and either of them
were greatly amazed at the great strength of his aduersary,
and the prince <hi>Meridian</hi> said, that the knight in his blowes
resembled the knight of the Sunne. Likewise those stout
and valiant knights <hi>Brandimardo</hi> and <hi>Oristedes,</hi> with no
lesse furie and redoubled blowes, did charge their aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and put great admiration in all them that did beholde
the battaile, who saide, that they twaine were two of the
stoutest knights that were in all the world. It was no lesse
worthie of beholding the great conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cion that was betwixt
the good Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and the stout king of <hi>Arabia
Rodaran,</hi> whose blowes were of so great force, that they wer
heard a great way of, and being an houre past since the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
began, the strong Pagan was greatly amazed at the
great force and strength of the Emperour, and sayd within
himselfe, that it was impossible for him to get any honour
in that cruell battaile, for that continuallie the force and
lightnesse of his aduersarie encreased, and a thing to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13995:151"/>
at, was his valiant courage, of whome naturally his
sonnes had receiued the like. And the Emperour <hi>Alicandro,</hi>
and all those kings which were with him, that dyd beholde
him, and knew him, being greatly amazed, said, that he was
one of the most valiantest knights in all the whole world,
and one that was most fiercest in battaile. Then the olde
king of <hi>Gedrosia,</hi> sayde, My flesh and my bones tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

when I doe thinke of that I shall sée this Emperour doe, in
the field against vs, he being in the middest betweene both
his sonnes, and it séemeth vnto mée, that there is no securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
whereby from the furie of their armes, we cannot make
any defence: and this good knightes that we haue on our
part, behold how many there is to the contrarie, who doeth
make resistance and detaine them, till the other doth destroy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
these miserable people. At which words all those mightie
kings that were in the triumphant Chariot, laughed verie
much, and imputed them vnto the great feare and little
force the which the king had, for that he was olde. But yet
time happened afterward, that they did féele and know that
the words which he spake, procéeded more of wisedome and
vnderstanding, then of feare.</p>
               <p>Likewise, it was a thing worthie to be séene, the furious
and well foughten battaile, that was betwixt the sonnes of
the <hi>Gran Thiteon,</hi> and the sixe knights their aduersaries,
for according as they were all strong and valiant, it were
enough to doe in this Chapter, onely to declare of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantnesse,
for the force of the Gyants was wonderfull, and
they stroke their blowes with so great furie, that either of
them was sufficient to cleaue an armed knight downe to
to the wast, but yet they contended with such knights who
knew verie well how to resist their great strengthes, and
made them to sweate droppes of bloud, for that they hadde
amongst them that mightie and strong knight <hi>Brandizel,</hi>
who by reason that he was verie bigge of bodie and of great
force, and hot in courage, brought his aduersarie in a great
perplexitie, and all his armour broken and vnbuckled, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were a finger thicke, and this was the eldest of
<pb facs="tcp:13995:152"/>
the sixe bretheren, with whome he combatted, and the most
valiantest and strongest: on the other side did combat, those
two valiant warriors the king <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> and the worthie
Tartarian <hi>Zoylo,</hi> and behaued themselues in such sorte in
their battaile, that they gaue them verie well to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
who they were. Likewise, with no lesse couragious
force, those two most valiant knights, <hi>Don Claros,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calus,</hi>
did oppresse with their mightie blowes, the two Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
their aduersaries, in such sort, that in the space of one
houre, they brought them in that case, that the victorie appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be theirs, and for that those two knights were not
knowne, they were greatly amazed there at, for their highe
and strange bountie.</p>
               <p>The good knight <hi>Flamides,</hi> did make battaile, with the
younger brother of the sixe Giants, and although the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
betwixt them was well foughten and verie perilons,
yet for all that by reason that his armour was excelent good,
and he verie light and stoute, he had the vauntage of his
aduersarie. Also the valiant king <hi>Florion,</hi> and the king of
<hi>Media,</hi> made their battaile with mightie &amp; furious blowes,
but before that one houre was past of the battaile, it was
well knowen that the king <hi>Florion,</hi> was the valianter of
both. At this time the foure princes had so entreated their
aduersaries, that they were verie wearie and faint, and
they likewise were well moyled, for that they had receiued
great and mightie blowes of them, for they were stronge,
stoute, and valiant.</p>
               <p>Thus in this sort was this cruel battaile betwixt them
all the best fought that euer was séene, betwixt so manie
knights, for that all those that dyd behold them, hadde their
eares deafened, with the continuall sounde of the hard and
thicke blowes, that were stroke amongst them, and there
could not have bene a greater noyse, if ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Likewise in this time it was a meruailous thing to sée
and beholde <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> with <hi>Bradaman,</hi> with although hée
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13995:152"/>
lacked but one finger bredth of eight foote high, which was
a gallant stature, yet before the <hi>Gran Camp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>on,</hi> he seemed
nothing, for that he was almost fiftene foote high, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the blowes of the one and of the other was equall in
furiousnesse, for that <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> did so charge with his furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
blowes <hi>Bradaman,</hi> that although he could not cut his
armour, yet dyd he all to torment and bruse his flesh and
bones, and with more lightnesse then was comprehended in
him, he made him to besturre himselfe and turne about on
the one side and on the other: the like dyd <hi>Bradaman,</hi> vnto
him, for although that <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> dyd saue and defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from the most parte of his blowes, by his great nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
and lightnesse, yet for all that, when he fastened a
blow vpon him, he made him to stoope both with knées and
hands to the grounde: and the armour of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> dyd
make such a sound, as though it had bene a bell, and out of
both their armours there flewe so great quantitie of sparks
of fier, as though they should be burned in them.</p>
               <p>In this sorte the battaile betwixt them continued more
then two houres, in which time some of those Ladies that
dyd behold them from the mightie pallace of the Emperor
<hi>Trebatio,</hi> were not much at quiet and ease at the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

for that the Princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> séeing her spouse and loyall
louer to combat so terriblie with that furious Pagan and
monster, her face began to be wan and pale, and the bloud
waxed colde within her bodie, so that fell downe in a
sound amongst the Ladies: in the like perplexitie was the
royall Empresse <hi>Briana,</hi> for her husband and sonne, and the
faire Princes <hi>Lindaraza,</hi> for her louing and faithfull spouse
<hi>Clauerindo,</hi> and the like hadde that faire Ladies <hi>Arqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosa,</hi>
for <hi>Don Siluerio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore you shall vnderstand, that after two hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
was passed from the firste béeginning of the battaile,
and that there was not one of those worthie champions
that hadde anie will or desire (as it séemed) to rest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
then the good Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> béeing very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to make a final ende &amp; conclusion of his battaile, with
<pb facs="tcp:13995:153"/>
the vttermost of all his force, he raysed himselfe in his styr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups,
with his sword in both his hands, &amp; therewith stroke
so strong and terrible a blow vpon the healme of the stout
pagan <hi>Rodaran,</hi> the which by reason that it was somewhat
crazed, with that battaile, as also with other battailes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
he altogether vnbuckled from his head, and breaking
his skull (by the force thereof all to péeces) he ouerthrew
him from his horse dead to the ground, and sayd, Now shal
it be séene if thou canst deliuer thy selfe from my handes,
and what can profit thée, the subteltie &amp; desceit of the quéene
of <hi>Carmania.</hi> The which being concluded he withdrew him
selfe a part, and did behold the battaile of the other knights,
whereat all that were on his part receiued great pleasure
and contentment, but in especiall, the Empres <hi>Briana,</hi> who
knew not where she was, with the great ioye and pleasure
she receiued. But the sorow and griefe of the Pagans was
very great, but in especial the Emperour <hi>Alicandro,</hi> who
had <hi>Rodaran</hi> in great estimation, for that he was one of the
strongest knights that was in all the whole Paganisme, as
of trueth he was so. But yet the griefe of his heart did not
herein ende, for that the worthie prince <hi>Brandizel,</hi> at that
instant ouerthrew at his féete the Gyant with whome hée
had his battaile, who was the eldest of the sixe brethren,
wherewith he vnlased his healme and cut of his head. And
it was not long after when that the two valiant brethren,
<hi>Don Claros,</hi> and <hi>Arcalus,</hi> did the lyke with their aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which were the second and third brothers, and were
the most fiercest and strongest of them all, and they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13995:153"/>
who as the other before did cut off their handes, of all the
which the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> receiued great sorrow and
griefe, and the like did all the Pagans, and they repented
them verie much in making of that challenge. Then <hi>Roda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marte</hi>
tooke the Prince of <hi>Aegypt</hi> prisoner, for being verie
wearie and féeble, of his owne good will he did yéeld himself
to be prisoner, so likewise the valiant knight <hi>Flamides</hi> dyd

more than three houres since they first beganne the battaile,
and both partes agreeing therevnto, they ceased for to take
breath, and to ease themselues, in the which time they dyd
beholde the great contention that was betwixt that valiant

the which was condigne and worthie to be séene, for
that without al order and measure they stroke their blowes,
with so great force, that all the fields and the mightie Citie
rong with the great noise of their battaile. All this time
did the faire and precious Princesse <hi>Lyndabrides</hi> from her

<hi>Trebatio,</hi> and for that both of them did resemble verie much

the knight of the Sunne, shée reioyced greatlie to sée them,
although another waie her heart was verie sadde and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull;
for that she did not sée the knight of the Sunne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

should be in <hi>Trapisond</hi> with the princesse <hi>Claridiana</hi> (which

within her selfe that hée should not bée in <hi>Trapisond,</hi> for if
he should bée there, it were not possible but that hée shoulde
vnderstand the great necessitie that his Father had of him,
and hauing knowledge thereof, there is no estate that should
cause him to bée absent so long, but that hée would haue
come thether for to haue holpen him. Thus hauing these
and many other such like thoughtes and cogitations in her
minde caused onelie by loue, shée did beholde the battaile, the
which at this time seemed to bée more kindled and better
fought than at the beginning, and gaue signe and token that
as that night the victorie was doubtfull, for that it was but
almost noone when the battaile began, and now it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

them, and yet in them appeared not anie manner shew of

when that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> sawe that it drew towards night, hée

and lifting vp the beauers of their healmes, they requested
their aduersaries that the battaile might cease betwixt them
for that daie, who were so outragious and angrie because
they could not ouercome them, that they would not depart
from thence vntill such time as the battaile were conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but they seeing that it was night, and howe that they
were verie sore brused and wearie, they coulde doe no lesse
but withdrawe themselues, and lifted vp their beauers to
receiue aire, so that the battell was wholy separated betwixt
them. Then straight waies there was made a great noise
of instrumentes, that all the whole fieldes were filled with
the sound, in such sorte, that one coulde not heare ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Then the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> being accompanied with
those noble knightes of his parte, went to speake vnto the

than if it had béene the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> gaue him
intertainment, and surrendered great thankes for his large

with all those mightie kings and vassals, descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from his triumphant Chariot, and came and talked with
the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> and his knightes, and the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued

intertainment which he gaue vnto his daughter for the time
that she was in his Court. It was then verie late, so that
the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> and all his knightes did take their
leaue of him, offering their Citie at their commandement,
and so returned, whereas they were receiued of all those
Ladies and Gentlewomen, with that ioy and pleasure as
reason required for to sée them returne safe and sound from
so terrible a battaile as they had maintained all that after
noone before, and euerie one receiued the praise as his valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
déedes deserued: and to the contrarie, the Pagans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
verie sadde, sorrowfull, and angrie, for the good
knights that were slaine on their partes, and <hi>Meridian</hi> and
<hi>Brandimardo</hi> were greatlie amazed, in that the Emperour
<hi>Trebatio</hi> had on his part so worthie and valiant knightes,
and praised in especiall <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> for that hée indured and
maintained battaile so long with the <hi>gran Campion.</hi> Then
the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> commanded straight waies, that
the dead bodies of all them that were slaine in that chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge

               <p>In this sort they passed awaie that night, and other two

               <p>THE proude and insolent heart of <hi>Bramarant</hi> coulde

                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:13995:155"/>
at such time as was concluded the battaile of the challenge
past, but as one that was verie desirous to be reuenged for
the same, he determined in great secret to depart out of the
campe, and to send and call them into a secret place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he might make battaile with them, and none to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
for so parte or separate them, and as he determined, so
he put it in vre, for that in a morning before the breake of
daie, at such time as the people of all the whole campe were
most at rest, in as secrete wise as was possible, beeing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with his strong armour, and mounted vpon his great
horse, he departed out of the campe with alonelie one man
that he carried with him, and being verie desirous to finde a
secret place to accomplish his desire, he neuer rested till hee
came vnto the skirt of the wildernesse of <hi>Grecia,</hi> whereas
he finding it a place fit for his purpose to accomplish his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
staied, and from thence sent his man that he brought
with him, vnto <hi>Meridian</hi> and <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> for to giue them
to vnderstand how that he did tarrie there for them, who
when he came backe againe vnto the campe, went straight
vnto the tent of the Prince, whereas he found them both
together, for that they were great friends after such time as
they battailed together the one with the other, and there hee
declared vnto them the message that he brought from <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marant,</hi>
who when they heard it, were of so valiaunt a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
that they were nothing troubled thereat, but rather it
séemed to be a great shame vnto them to goe together, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their aduersarie but one alone, so that betwixt them
there grew a contention who should go first, but in the end
for that they could not conclude that point, and neither of
them would be the last, it fell out that they must goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and according vnto the great force and strength of that
worthie Pagan their aduersarie that did abide their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
afterwarde it did not repent them of their so going.
Thus these two friendes being armed with their rich and
strong armour, without giuing anie knowledge vnto the
Emperour or anie other person whether they went, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of the campe, and béeing guided by the man who

of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and not hauing trauailed long therein, they
found <hi>Bramarant</hi> a foote from his horse, lying along vnder
the shadowe of certaine trées a sléepe, for that the Sunne
was verie hot, and he laide his head vppon his healme, and
slept so soundlie, that although they came vnto him making
a great noise, yet could he not awake, vntill such time as
<hi>Brandimardo</hi> with his Speare stroke him a little blowe
vppon the breast, wherewith this mightie Pagan awaked,
and séeing his aduersaries before him, as one amazed arose
vp, and put his helme vpon his head, and with a trice leapt
vpon his horse whom he had there at hand tied vnto a tree,
and tooke his Speare in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meridian</hi> séeing him in that case, sayde: <hi>Bramarant,</hi> what
is it that you would haue with vs, wée are now come he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at thy challenge? That which I will haue, answered
hee with greate pride, is to make you both vnderstand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that my force is much more than the force of all the
knightes of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and to reuenge the wordes that you
sayde vnto mée before the Emperour <hi>Alycandro,</hi> and those
that were with him.</p>
               <p>Unto proude and arrogant persons, answered <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
a little occasion is sufficient for to cause contention and
strife, of little effect or profite, and lesse necessarie or néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but seeing that it is so, that thou hast so good a will
for to haue battaile with vs, let vs straight waies come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and I hope in the high Gods that either of vs both
will giue thée inough to vnderstande. And in saying these
wordes, with his Speare in a readinesse in his hande, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
himselfe vnto the course, and desired <hi>Brandimardo</hi>
that hée shoulde not aide nor helpe him, for anie thing
whatsoeuer that hée shoulde sée passe in the battaile. Thus
<hi>Bramarant</hi> béeing in a readinesse, they both set spurs vnto
their horses, and made their encounter together with great
furie, and for that they were both of verie greate force and
strength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they shéeuered their Speares all to péeces, and
without doing anie more harme, passed the one by the other
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13995:157"/>
with a gallant demeanour, and vpright in their saddles,
but they had not gone forwardes many paces, when that
they tourned about their horses, with their swordes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
drawen in their handes, and ioyning together in such
sorte that they might strike the one the other, they stroke
at each other such cruel blowes, that they cloue their shields
in péeces, and the pointes of their swords descended downe
vpon their healmes with so greate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urie, that greate abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce
of fire flew out of either of them, then they stroke
each other another blowe, with so great furie, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
their hades downe vnto their breastes, and then <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marant</hi>
did verie well féele that the force and strength of
<hi>Meridian</hi> was verie much, and hée likewise on the other
side gaue him to vnderstand that his blowes were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and that it was requisite with greate care to defende
himselfe from them, for the which <hi>Meridian</hi> with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
courage dyd laie vppon and charge his aduersarie, and
with all lightnesse possible did cleere himselfe from his
blowes.</p>
               <p>In this sorte they executed their battaile more than
halfe an houre, making so greate a noise, that three mites

                  </gap> great blowes

than three quarters of an houre in their battaile, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
point of aduauntage betwéene them. Then <hi>Meridian</hi>
with both his handes stroke such a blowe vppon the healm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Bramarant,</hi> that hée tooke his remembraunce from him,
and without anie féeling his horse carryed him round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the fielde. But this mightie Pagan straight waies
came againe vnto himselfe, and with greate furie setting
spurres vnto his horse, hée retourned vpon <hi>Meridian,</hi> and
with an infernall furie stroke so terrible a blowe vppon
the healme of that worthie and valiant Prince, that if it
had not béene so good as it was, hee had clouen him downe
vnto the waste, but yet for all that, hée made the bloud to
gush out both at his eyes and nose in great abundance, and
depriued him of all vnderstanding, so that his horse carryed
<pb facs="tcp:13995:158"/>
him about the field as though he had bene dead, and hauing
no power to make resistance against his vnbrideled wrath,
he went after him with great villanie, for to strike him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
blowe before that he should come vnto himselfe, the
which being perceiued by that stout knight <hi>Brandimardo,</hi>
with great furie he set spurres vnto his horse, and before
that <hi>Bramarant</hi> had space for to strike <hi>Meridian,</hi> hée ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
him, and stroke him such a blowe with his sworde in
both his handes vpon the right shoulder, that he had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
him vnto the ground, if that he had not embraced
himselfe with his horse necke. Then the furious Pagan
séeing himselfe so intreated, straight waies setled himselfe in
his saddle, and returned and stroke such a blowe at <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimardo</hi>
vpon his healme, that he thought verilie his téeth
had bene all broken in his head with beating one agaynst
another, his head was so ouerladen, and almost from himself
the raines of his bridle fell out of his hand, &amp; his horse ran
awaie with him, at which time the valiant Prince <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
was come againe vnto himselfe, and was verie sorrie for
that <hi>Brandimardo</hi> was come for to helpe him, but with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
great wrath and angrie courage he returned vpon <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marant,</hi>
his aduersarie did the like, as also <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> so
that betwéene thrée the battaile was so well fought, that it
was a strange thing to behold. But now let vs leaue them
for to tell what happened after this.</p>
               <p>You shall vnderstand that by and by after that these thrée
valiant knights were departed out of the campe, by many
they were found lacking, yet there was not one that knew
wherefore they went, neither did they imagine that betwixt
them there should bée anie defiance, so that the Emperour
<hi>Alycandro</hi> and all the rest were without anie care or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
of that matter, but thought verilie that they had ben
gone all thrée vpon some aduenture which was offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them in that Countrie. Likewise the great valour that
was in all the thrée, did assure them to be without anie care
of whatsoeuer peril might happen vnto them, but that man
whome <hi>Bramarant</hi> carried with him, fearing the great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13995:158"/>
that might come vnto his Lord, for that he was assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with so strong and valiant knightes, straight waies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that he sawe the battaile begunne, retourned vnto the
campe, and secretlie declared vnto the <hi>gran Campion</hi> all
that passed, who straight waies without anie staying armed
himselfe with his strong armour, and mounting vppon a
mightie Elephant departed out from the armie, and gaue
none to vnderstand whether he went, but all men thought
that he went to recreate himselfe in the Countrie, as the
others were gone. Then taking his waie towards the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
by reason of the great pace of the Elephant, in a
short space he came thether, but yet two miles good before he
came vnto the place of their combat, he heard the great noise
the which they made with their terrible blowes, which gaue
such a sound through the woodes and valleies, as though a
companie of péeces of Ordinance had bene shot off, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the sound, by aime he came vnto the place, hée was
not as yet come vnto the place of the battaile by a good
stones cast, when that he saw comming towards him on the
one side in great hast a knight of a bigge stature and great
members, who séemed to be a gyant, mounted vpon a great
horse verie well armed, and his Speare in his hand, and as
it appeared by his hastie comming, he was allured thether
by the noise of the battaile betwéene the thrée knights, but
when he sawe the <hi>gran Campion,</hi> he neuer rested till hée
came vnto him, and sayd.</p>
               <p>Whether art thou iourneying this waie <hi>Bradaman?</hi>
Then he verie angrie because the knight was so bolde to
aske him whether he went, wold not answere him because
he would not be deteined, till such time as he sawe in what
state the battaile was betwixt the thrée knights, but setting
spurres vnto his Elephant, he rode on, and this big knight
followed him till they came wheras the battaile was made,
and sawe that it was the best fought battaile that euer they
had séene in all their liues, for that the two Princes <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
and <hi>Brandimardo</hi> were verie valiant knights, and of
great force and strength, and charged <hi>Bramarant</hi> with their
<pb facs="tcp:13995:159"/>
mightie blowes, verie thicke and stronglie, in such sort, that
if he had not bene of so great valour and force as he was, be
could not haue preuailed against them. But this furious
Pagan was so braue and couragious, that he estéemed in
nothing their mightie blows, but repaied them with others
of so great strength, that many times hée made them so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonied,
that they were driuen to sustaine themselues by
their saddle bowes and horse neckes to kéepe themselues
from falling, but by reason that they were two of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
they alwaies put him in great perplexitie, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his anger and wrath the more to increase. At this time
the <hi>gran Campion</hi> setled himselfe for to helpe his sonne,
the sooner to make a conclusion of that battaile, but the big
knight that came thether with him (who receiued great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
to sée the thrée how they made that battaile) dyd
put himselfe before <hi>Bradaman</hi> and said, that if he would aid
and succour his sonne, that then he shoulde be constrained
first of all to combat with him: who being verie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie
at those wordes, answered and said: Sir knight, tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
a little, and I will make thee to vnderstand what a foole
thou art for to take with me contention. In saying these
wordes he departed from him, and setting spurres vnto his
Elephant, with his Speare in his hand, which was as bigge
as the mast of a ship, he came running against the knight,
whose with so great swiftnesse as his horse could run, came
against him, whereas they made their encounters in such
sort, that their speares were shieuered in péeces, &amp; the shie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
slew into the aire, and either of them declined somwhat
backwarde vppon the arsons of their saddles, but straight
waies they arose and setled themselues againe, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out their swordes they came the one against the other,
whereas begun betwixt them such a battaile, that it was a
wonder to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>lew out of their healmes and harnesse, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times they were verie sore astonied &amp; from themselues.
Then the fierce Pagan <hi>Bramarant,</hi> and the two knights that
did battaile with him, with the great noise that the other
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13995:159"/>
two made in their contention, left off their combat, and dyd
behold the other, and were greatlie amazed to sée with what
great furie and force they executed their blowes the one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the other, the <hi>gran Campion</hi> they knew, but not the
other knight, yet they had him in estimation of a worthie
knight, and were verie desirous to know who he was, for
that they could not imagine whom he should be, so mighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
did he behaue himselfe. Thus after a while that they
beheld the battaile of the two, béeing verie desirous for to
conclude and make an end of theirs, they beganne a new to
charge the one the other so stronglie, that it seemed they
were more fierce and furious at that time than they were
at the beginning. And béeing in this angrie and doubtfull
battaile, the Hystorie doth leaue the one and the other, for

of all care and thought of their high and royall estates, if
they might haue béen frée of the great bondage in the which
they were bound, but hauing a great respect for to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
their duties, the same daie that they met together, and
knew the one the other, they departed out from the Iland,
and embarked themselues in the Princesse ship, and hauing
a faire winde and prosperous, with great ioy they began to

saile towardes the Empire of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and the fourth daie
after their departure from the Ilande being at thrée of
the clocke in the morning, a great waie from them they saw
comming two great ships, and as it séemed with all sayles
bearing they came towardes them. So in a short space by
reason that the one sailed towards the other, their ships met
together. Then they that were within the two ships ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the other ship, and grapled them together, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out with a loude voice, commanding them to amaine, &amp;
to yeeld themselues prisoners. The which being hearde by
those two faithfull louers, they straight waies laced on their
helmes, and came forth to the ship side, and asked what they
were that would take them prisoners? Then straight waies
more than ten knights of a gallant proportion and wel ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
came forth vnto them, and sayd. That vnto two alone
knights as they were, there was no néede for to make that
account, but yet for that you shall vnderstand vnto whome
you shall yéeld your selues prisoners, know that we are all

               <p>Of truth (sayde the Princesse) this cannot be, that you

               <p>Then you shall vnderstand of a truth (sayde the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse)

               <p>False Knight, they mocking shal little profite thée, for in

Then all the rest greatlie amazed at that blow, drew their
swords and leapt altogether into their ship, and beganne to
charge them with their blowes in the best wise they could,
but these two who in the like conflicts were verie well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented,
drew out their fine and slashing swords, and so
besturred themselues, that with a few blows they slew sixe
of them, &amp; the other which remained, making a great noise
leapt againe into their ships, out of the which came straight

them to the ground, with such mortall blowes, that the rest
which remained aliue being terrified and amazed, retyred
backe vnto their ships, and the knight of the Sunne and the
Princesse followed them, whereas they found a new resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
with certain fresh knights and other people that were
in the ships, who began to charge them verie greatlie, and
laide vpon them many heauie blowes, but the knight of the
Sunne taking the foreward of his mistres, setled himselfe
in such sort, that if there had ben a thousand knights before
him, he wold haue estéemed them little, and being verie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to bée reuenged on the long time that he was idle in
the solitarie Iland, he put himselfe amongest his enimies,
and charged them with such mortall blowes, and without
all pittie, that if the battaile had indured but a little longer,
he had not left one aliue of all that were in the ships. Then
those which remained, seeing there was no resistance to bée

made against the furie of those two knights, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

downe before them, and craued pardon for their liues. Then they
who were redie to accomplish their requests, did grant them
their desires, and vnderstanding the truth how they were
rouers, &amp; how that they had many prisoners in their ships,
they commaunded them to bring them forth before them.
Then they obeying their commandement, carried them into
certaine bigge cabbines in their ships, whereas they found
many men and women with chaines and boltes of yron,
and amongst them the knight of the Sunne knew his good
Pages <hi>Binnano</hi> and <hi>Aurelio,</hi> and the twentie knightes of
<hi>Candia</hi> that were in his companie. Likewise the auncient
Pilot that tolde vnto him the storie of the diuellish <hi>Fauno,</hi>
of the which he was not a little glad, for that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
by his handes. But when they knew him as well
by his armour as by his face, for that at that time his bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
was lifte vp, it is not to be spoken how greatlie they
meruailed, and what ioy and pleasure they receiued, and as
amazed they looked the one vpon the other, and could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that he should be aliue, and his two Squires as from
themselues, came vnto him, and knéeled downe before him,
and began to kisse his armed hands, and the skirt of shirt of
maile, saying: O Lord God, how can we gratifie this great

meruailed verie much thereat, and went and knéeled downe

for that she knew the knight of the Sunne did beare

that it shoulde not be knowen who she was. Then the
knights of <hi>Candia</hi> and the auncient Pilot came and kissed
the hands of the knight of the Sunne, giuing him greate
thankes for their libertie, which at his handes they obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

Thus afterwards all together went vnto the solitarie I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

Countries, causing great admiration vnto all those that did

               <p>When the knights of <hi>Candia</hi> vnderstood all that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
they gaue the knight of the Sunne to vnderstand how

towards <hi>Candia,</hi> they met at the sea with that roauer, and
after a long time that they had made battaile with them, by
reason that they were many, they were constrained to yéeld
and be their prisoners, and how that long before that, they
had taken his Pages, and they returned backe againe for to
séeke the solitarie Iland in his demand, and there to die in
his companie. Thus after a while that they had bene with

them, saying, that he had a iourney in hand with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
that he could not by anie meanes excuse, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them to God and good fortune, and gaue them the

which was a great quantitie, for the which they gaue him
great thankes and kissed his handes, taking their leaue of
him, although with a better will they woulde haue gone
with him in his companie. And being departed they tooke
their iourney towardes the solitarie Iland, hauing inough
to do all their liues after for to tel of the knight of the Sun.

and not being troubled with contrarie winds, neither with

the which was but two daies iourney from <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
whereas they vnderstood of the great multitude of Pagans
that were entered into <hi>Grecia,</hi> and in what state the wars
were in, then they gaue great thankes vnto almightie God,
and departed from thence, and for that the knight of the

vnto them to be the noise of some strong and well foughten
battaile or combat on horsebacke, And being verie desirous
to know what it should bée, they amended their horse pace,
and rode that waye from whence they thought the noyse
should come. In the ende of a good houre that they had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed,
the noyse brought them vnto the place whereas the

<pb facs="tcp:13995:163"/>

<hi>gran Campion,</hi> which was by his great and huge bignesse,
they all greatlie meruailed to sée that strong and rigorous
battaile that was betweene them, and coulde not imagine
who that valiant Pagan <hi>Bramarant</hi> shóuld be, for that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

stature, and one that stroke so terrible blowes, neither could
he fall into the reckoning of those stout and valiant knights
<hi>Meridian</hi> and <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> who so stronglie did charge
their aduersarie, and made so great resistaunce against the
furie of that Pagan. On the other parte they greatlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the <hi>gran Campion</hi> and his aduersarie, and as they
were beholding the singular disposition of the knight, and
the high bountie wherewith hée made his combat with

<hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and greatlie reioyced to sée with what cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

you haue heard. All this time dyd the knight of the Sunne
behold <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> his brother, and reioysed very much to sée
him so good, strong, and valiant, and if it had not bene, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would not anger nor giue any discontentment vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the princes, he would haue giuen him selfe to be knowen
vnto him, his ioye and pleasure was so great, but because it
was the princes will, not at that present to be knowen, it
was dissembled, although that <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and the other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
dyd desire it verie much, who being greatly amazed, at
the mightie and gallant disposition of both of them, could
not be perswaded to the contrarye, but that one of them
should be the knight of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>At this time the knight began to approch, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
sayde that it was time for them all for to retourne, they
vnto their campe, and the other vnto the citie.
<pb facs="tcp:13995:169"/>
And as they saide, it was concluded, and they all departed
together from that place: and when that they came nigh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their campe, <hi>Meridian</hi> and <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> dyd take their
leaue of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and of the knight of the Sunne, giuing

offering vnto them great courtesie.</p>
               <p>When that they were departed, <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> dyd aske the
knight of the Sunne and the princes, if it were their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
for to goe and take their lodging with him in the citie
and pallace of his Father the Emperour, who will take
great ioye and pleasure for to honour such knights as they
were, within his owne pallace. Then they aunswered him
with great courtesie, giuing him thankes for his gentle of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
but desired him at that time that he would pardon them,
and heareafter they shall haue better oportunitie of time
for to goe and kisse the handes of the Emperour, but first
their determination was, for to doe him some seruice in
those warres: and how that with this pretence, they came
forth of their countries, the which is verie farre, and a great
way out of Grecia, for which occasion they came vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of things necessarie to their persons, requesting him to
pleasure them so much as to send them a Tent, for to lodge
themselues, and their squires: whereat <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
glad, for that they would be of their part, and for to
send them out of hand, the Tent, he tooke his leaue of them,
leauing them in the field, harde by the other campe, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Citie and went vnto the royall pallace, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he founde the Emperour, and all the other high princes,
in a great alteration, determining for to arme themselues
for to goe and seeke him, for that they could not heare any
newes of him, where he was become, mistrusting that some
euill had happened vnto him, he was so long out of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but when they saw him enter in, they were all verie
glad and ioyfull, but in especiall the Emperour, who asked
of him where he hadde bene, then he in the presence of them
all, declared what had happened vnto him since his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
out of the citie. But when he said that he left the <hi>Gran
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13995:169"/>
Campion,</hi> dead in the wildernesse, their ioye and pleasure
dyd redouble in them all, likewise when that he told them
of the battayle, which the strange knight had made with
<hi>Bramarant,</hi> they were greatly amazed, and could not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
what knight he should be of so great power and
force, except it were the knight of the Sunne, who of long
time they neuer heard any newes of: yet they thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
that if it were he, he would not keepe himselfe secret,
so that the Emperour and all the rest remained in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and prayed vnto God, that it might be the knight of
the Sunne, for that hauing him with them, they should
thinke themselues in great securitie of the mightie power
of the Pagans, surely they receiued great griefe for his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
although the good Emperour dyd make no shew ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
yet dyd there neuer enter any mirth into his heart, since
his departure out of the court, and in especial for that he had
sent many knights into diuers parts, for to séeke him, but
yet could he neuer heare any newes of him: and now was

the battayle with <hi>Bramarant.</hi> Then straight waies, he sent
vnto the two knights two Tentes, verie ritch of gold and
silke, with bedding verie good for them and for their damsels
and squires, and all other things which he thought néedful
and necessarie for them, and sent the king of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> in
his behalfe vnto them, with them that carryed the Tentes.
When that he came into the field, he straight wayes mette
with them, to whome the king dyd present that which was
sent, and sayde that the Emperour did send them great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
saying, that if it were their pleasures for to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

great pleasure and contentment therein, for that there hée
could better giue them such honour as vnto so good knights
doth appertaine: the which they receiued with great thanks,
and sent him word that they did kisse his Emperiall hands
for the great courtesie shewed vnto them. When that the

               <p>Art thou by fortune that knight that did combat with

blow with both his hands, and stroke him such a one vpon,

he had not imbraced himselfe with his horse necke, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the one to laie vpon the other verie strenglie, with so
great charge, that many thimes they were both astonied,
and the sparkes of fire were so many that flew out of their
armours, that if the Moone had not shined so bright, by the
light of the sparkes, they might haue well seene how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
at this time were all the people of the campe round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them for to sée that strong and well fought battayle,
and were all greatlie amazed at the high bountie &amp; strength
of the knight of the Sunne, and the noise was so great the
which they made with their terrible blowes, that it was as
well heard within the Citie, as in the campe whereas they
<pb facs="tcp:13995:173"/>
did combat, which was the occasion, as well for that they
were aduised thereof, that the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficleer,</hi>
with all those worthie Princes and knightes, came
straight waies forth of the Citie, and with great hast came
vnto the place whereas they heard the great noise of the
battaile, and thether whereas the most people were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together, and when they came thether, they sawe that
fierce Pagan and the knight of the Sunne, how they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued
themselues in their battaile, and by reason that it
was night, and their blowes strong and great wherewith
great abundance of fire flew out of their armours, it was a
strange and wonderfull thing to beholde, so that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and all those that came with him meruailed greatlie
at the strong and mightie force of them both. Then when
this stout Pagan sawe himselfe compassed rounde about
with so many people, and knew that the Emperour and all
the rest of those precious and worthie knightes that came
with him were there present, he sawe that as then it was
verie néedfull for him to vse all his whole force &amp; strength,
and béeing desirous in their presence to shew forth all his
greate and mightie power, hée charged the knight of the
Sunne with terrible and heauie blowes, reuenging and
blaspheming against himselfe, and this he sayd within his
heart.</p>
               <p>Oh <hi>Iupiter,</hi> if it bée so that thou art he that doth combat

               <p>And when hée had sayd these wordes, and sawe that the
force and strength of his aduersarie dyd still increase, hée
was verie furious and wrathfull against himselfe, and sayd:

thou acknowledge him to be a God, although he were the

for to defend thy selfe from him, but also for to destroie and

presence of his mistres the Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> who did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde

nothing that did abide before him, and he charged this stout
Pagan with such furious blowes, that he gaue him well to
vnderstand that he was the mightiest and strongest knight
that was in all the world. In this sort did these two make
their combat, putting great admiration in all those that did
beholde them. Then after that they had battailed together
more than the space of one houre, this furious and fierce Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.
sayd within himselfe, that his aduersa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and furious, that he could not iudge to the contrarie but that
he must néeds be some infernal diuell, or that <hi>Pluto</hi> Prince

therefore it shall béee better for me (séeing that I get no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)

knight of the Sunne, that it had bene sufficient to haue clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
him downe vnto the wast, if that his healme had béene
as the helmes of other knights, but the finenesse therof, with
the inchanted mixture did withstand the sharpe edge of his
sword, in such sort, that it did not damage anie part therof,
but yet for all that, the force of the blow was such, that hée
made him to fal forwards, &amp; with his head to strike his horse
a great blow vpon the necke, and againe if that with both

must néedes haue fallen vnto the ground, and with the

Now to retourne vnto the knight of the Sunne, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in the Campe of the Christians, the Hysto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
saith, that the great desire which the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi>
and <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and al the other worthie Princes and knights
had, for to know who the knight of the Sunne was, and his
companion, they would not depart from them till such time
as the Princesse <hi>Claridiana</hi> by great importunation did pul
off her helme, and went vnto the knight of the Sunne and
pulled off his, and returned vnto the Emperour and sayde:
My good Lord, let your highnesse behold, if that contentment
and satisfaction be not made of all the tumult and trauaile
which hath bene caused vnto you this night, by this knight
and that Pagan which is runne awaie. But when that the
Emperour and all those knights did know them, it cannot
be rehearsed the great ioy, mirth, and pleasure that they all
receiued, for that there was not one amongst them all, that
desired anie thing so much as to heare newes of the knight
of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>Then the Emperour sayde: Faire and worthie Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
I was alwaies fullie perswaded with my selfe, that
your soueraigne highnesse could not let but come and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
vs, and put vs all in great securitie. Then the knight
of the Sunne came for to kisse the handes of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
who receiued him with that great loue that he alwaies
bare vnto him. Then straight waies came forth the king
<hi>Florion,</hi> and with him the wise <hi>Lyrgando,</hi> and sayd vnto the
<pb facs="tcp:13995:175"/>
Emperor. Lord, let your highnesse giue vs part of the sight
of this knight, whom we haue all desired so much to know,
and therwith they embraced him many times, as they that
entirelie and with all their harts did loue him. Then those
good and perfect friends of his, <hi>Claueryndo</hi> and <hi>Brandizel,</hi>
and that good Troyan, as all the rest of the oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

knights. It cannot be rehearsed the great mirth that all of
them receiued, as also the worthie things that passed at that
méeting, especiallie with the roiall Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> for
that all did receiue her with that dutie and curtesie as was
due vnto so high a Princesse. Then was there complaints
made, for that they till that time woulde not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be knowen, as also for that they were absent so
long out of the Countrie. Whereto the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
requesting them to let that demaund passe for that
time, because to giue them to vnderstand thereof, it will
aske a great time, and how that he had it all written, and
when time did serue he woulde shew it vnto them, forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they were thinges worthie to be knowen &amp; publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>
               <p>After they had passed these and many other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, they all together went and returned into the
Citie, and the king <hi>Sacridoro</hi> went before to carrie newes
vnto the Empresse <hi>Briana</hi> of the comming of the knight of
the Sunne, and vnto all the rest of the Ladies and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen
that were there with her, who were meruailous
gladde and ioyfull at those newes, but most especiallie the
Empresse, who alwayes was verie sad and sorrowfull, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the knight of the Sunne was departed from the
Court. Then at the sodaine noise of these newes, great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
was made, and an innumerable companie of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
was light, that it séemed in the Citie to be noone daie,
and all the stréetes were full of people for to sée their good

the which this Hystorie doth let passe vntolde for to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide

the rest of the night that remained, they passed awaie with
mirth and pastimes, whereas the king <hi>Florion</hi> and the wise
<hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> could not satisfie themselues in beholding the
knight of the Sunne, meruailing greatlie to sée him so much

from them out of <hi>Persia,</hi> and héere began he to tell of many

               <p>Now will I sée if the power of that Christian Knight

one peece from another, there was sodainlie hearde a

that the heauens woulde haue rent a sunder, and in the

so dreadfull and horrible to beholde, that it séemed to bée
some infernall vision, casting out fire at his nose and eyes,
and in both his handes he had a great mase of yron, with the

which he made a shewe as though he would haue stroken

not one in all that Tent but dyd tremble ansd was afraide,
thinking verilie that they should be destroied for that which
<hi>Bramarant</hi> had done. But this proude Barbarian who fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not all that infernall companie, with no more dreade
than if it had bene a weake and féeble damsell, he did abide
his comming, and as this vestigell or diuell did make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

blow at him with his sword, and thinking to haue clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

at the aire, for that the vestigell as a fancie consumed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie,

and all those that were with him were verie sorrie
for that which <hi>Bramarant</hi> had done, &amp; mistrusted that there
would happen vnto them great euill and misfortune for the

that durst retourne against him in the quarrell of their
Gods, but one <hi>Meridian</hi> and <hi>Brandmardo,</hi> who because they
would not anger the Emperour were in quiet, wherewith
<hi>Bramarant</hi> went out of the tent with great furie. Then the
Emperour thought within himselfe that it were good (som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to appease his furie,) for to send for the bodie of the

kings, the most principallest of all the armie, should put on
mourning apparell, and cause him to be laide vpon a béere,
and so brought vnto the Campe, and commanded to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
them ten thousand armed knightes, and all those Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
that came from the Orientall Ilands, that were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
vnto <hi>Bramarant</hi> shoulde goe with them. And in this
sorte these thirtie kings with all their companie departed,
according vnto the vse and manner of their Countrie, which
<pb facs="tcp:13995:183"/>
was a strange thing to sée, &amp; when they came into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes,
they straight waies found the bodie of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>gran Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi>
which was begun to bée eaten with the fowles, and
after that they all for a while had made great lamentation
and bewailed his death, those kings (for to doe him more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)
did balme him, and then laid him vpon a Béere which
they brought with them, that was verie rich, and couered
with a faire cloth of Tissue, and so carried him towards the
Campe, whereas he was receiued with great honour, by the
Emperour and all those mightie Princes that were with
him, who went forth and met with them a good mile off.
The manner which they vsed for to giue his sepulchre with
more honour (according vnto the vse of their Countrie)
was, that they laide the dead corse vpon a verie broade and
smooth marble stone all white, whereas they burned and
consumed the bodie all to ashes, and in the meane time that
hée was a burning, all the principallest of the whole armie,
were placed round about the fire, all couered with robes of
Sackcloth, so long, that it trailed vppon the ground, and
made great sorrow and lamentation, and praied vnto their
Gods to receiue him into their companie, in which time all
the praiers which his sonne <hi>Bramarant</hi> made, was no other
but blaspheming against all the Elements, and against na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for that they had power for to consume and burne the
bodie of the <hi>Gran Campion</hi> his Father. Thus when that
the bodie was all consuned and burned, the ashes remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vpon the Marble stone, the which was taken and put
in verie rich vessells of golde, wherevnto they put water
and stirred it together, and put the vessells vpon a faire Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Then the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> (the more to honour
the <hi>Gran Campion)</hi> beganne first for to drinke of the same
mixture, and after him <hi>Bramarant,</hi> and after them in order
all those Kings, Princes, and worthie Knightes that were
in the Campe, till such time as they left no mention of the
water and ashes, so the mightiest Lords that were in all the
Paganisine, made their bodies the sepulchre of that mighty
Pagan, and this they had amongst them for the most hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablest
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13995:183"/>
burying that could be. With these and many other
thinges moe which the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> commaunded
to bee done for the <hi>Gran Campion,</hi> making great lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for his death, <hi>Bramarant</hi> was somewhat appeased, and
lost great part of that outragious furie and wrath which he
had conceiued, and vnderstoode and procured no other thing
but onelie how and by what meanes he might make terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and cruell reuengement for the death of his welbeloued
Father.</p>
               <p>Then after certaine daies were past of the truce which
was taken with the Gréekes, they beganne of all partes to
prepare and make themselues in a readinesse against the
battaile that was determined, and was thought to be of both
partes the brauest and most cruellest and bloudie that
euer was séene vpon the earth, for that the Emperour <hi>Aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candro</hi>
had commaunded, that the first daie that the Gréekes
should come forth for to giue them battaile, that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of their Campe shoulde procéede against them, for that
they wold at once conclude that enterprise, and not to leaue
their aduersaries anie force and strength at all, for to return
againe vnto the fielde, for although there were many bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes
betwixt them, as the Hystorie hath shewed you, yet
there went not forth the third parte of the people that was
there with them which were so many in number, that there
might well bée made of them thrée mightie armies, and of
truth there was neuer séene in all <hi>Asia</hi> nor <hi>buropa</hi> so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

field an infinite number of barbarous people, of different
and diuerse Nations, and the most part proude and terrible
Gyants, that the like were neuer seene in all the world, but
God of his goodnesse created such heartes in that mightie
Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> and in his worthie proicnie, as also
in those high Princes, and stout, worthie, &amp; valiant knights
that were in his companie, that not onelie they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all feare and dreade, but also had great force and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

but receiued great contentment to be there at that present,
for that the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> (séeing with him his sons
and so many worthie Princes &amp; knights) receiued so great
ioy and pleasure, that he thought himselfe to be the most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest

After this sorte they were all in sundrie and different

all valiant and well armed, who comming towards <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
by fortune did méete together at sea, and comming both
in one demand, they kept companie together vntill they
came into the port. Then so soone as the newes was know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> did so much
that his sonnes and all that worthie crew did go forth to
receiue them, &amp; being together in the field, they went vnto
the sea side, whereas they found at their comming thether,
that the king and the Quéene were landed a shore, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
vnto them to giue them entertainment, the knight of

we may haue little feare of our enimies, hauing your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
on our side. This feare may we all put a part, being
in your companie (sayd the Quéene <hi>Radamira)</hi> for he that

me from all the knights of the world. Well then (said
the king <hi>Liseo)</hi> I am no lesse bound vnto this happie Prince
than all the rest, for that by him I haue my life, &amp; all my

with great loue, &amp; all that were there reioyced of their
comming, for that the king was a verie good knight, &amp; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with all good manners and conditions, &amp; the Quéene
<hi>Radamira</hi> was verie faire and gratious, and receiued won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
ioy and contentment to sée the knight of the Sun, for
there was nothing in all the world that she desired so much
to see, but when she sawe him so much growen, as well in
bignesse as in height, more than he was at such time as hée
was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> she meruailed verie much. When the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13995:185"/>
knight of the Sun and those that came with him had giuen
them their welcome, they tooke their waie towards <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
&amp; passed by the camp of the Pagans in sight of
them all, who did behold them, &amp; offered them no harme nor
discurtesie, for that there was a truce betwixt them. When
they came vnto the Citie, the Emperour and the Empres,
and all those Ladies and Gentlewomen that were with her
receiued great ioy &amp; loued their new guests, grasifieng very
much their comming. And héere you shall vnderstand that
at this present that worthie and valiant Tartarian <hi>Zoylo,</hi>
when he sawe the Quéene <hi>Radamira</hi> was taken in loue
with her, with great good will for to take her to he his wise
and spouse, if that she were so content therewith, and from
that daie forwardes he did procure by all meanes to giue
her knowledge thereof, and she when she was aduertised &amp;
knew him to be so valiant a knight and high a Prince, she
tooke great pleasure in his seruice. So by reason that the
time drew nigh of the generall battaile, with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
the Emperour and all those worthie knights minded
no other thing but to visite their people, commanding that
they should be prouided of good armour &amp; &amp; of all other things
necessarie for the battaile, as they that made account, that
they had all that remained in the world against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
on the other part in the campe of the Pagans they did
as much, for in all the daies and time of their truce, they
vnderstoode no other thing but to make all things in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
against the daie appointed, being determinded amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
themselues to goe forth all the whole Campe vnto
the battaile, for that they would at that time make an end
and destroie all the Gréekes, and straight wayes enter into

did greatlie meruaile, that the great number of so manye

In testimonie whereof, at such time as the daie shoulde

Likewise there were that sawe, that whereas the shining
starres alwayes at the breake of daie dyd vanish and take
their leaue, that now at that instant many Comets of fire
dyd fall from heauen into the campe of the Pagans, and
did as much harme as thought they had béene thunderbolts

him such a companie of valiant and worthy knights, and of
high estate, that neuer the like was séene, who little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le

although they saw before their eies, put in good order
their enimies and occasions of the great destruction looked

thing of great wonder and dread to behold, in especiall, for
those Ladies and gentlewomen that were in <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
who séeing their husbandes and children to depart in
that sort, their clamors and cryes seemed to assend vnto the
heauens. And in the mightie citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> there
was séene no other thing but olde men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who went bare foot &amp; bare legged, through the stréetes
from one church vnto as other, praying vnto God to graunt
the victorie on their parts, and to defend his christian flock.
At this time was the Empresse <hi>Briana,</hi> and the fayre prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse

them whome they loued more then themselues, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
great sorow and dread at their hearts, which caused
them to shed many teares, and to pray vnto God for the
victorie from the bottome of their hearts.</p>
               <p>Now let vs leaue them, and tell of the Pagans, who
were so many in number, that all the night past, with good
part of the morning they hadde enough to doe for to set all
things in good order and in a redinesse for the appointed
battaile.</p>
               <p>The first battaile ordained by the Emperour <hi>Alicandro,</hi>
he gaue vnto the rule and gouernement of that proude pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<hi>Bramarant,</hi> who like vnto an hungery Lyon or wolfe,
wold be the first, and he had with him fiftie thousand horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
the most furious and fiersest that was to be found in
all the whole campe, amongst whome he caryed all those
giants that his father the <hi>Gran Campion,</hi> had brought out
of his owne countries, which were more then one thousand
and all mounted vppon Elephants, who with certaine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens
that they brought with them, made them to be verie

this braue Barbarian in the middest amongst them, he
thought verely that all the whole world (if they had bene

               <p>The second battaile was gouerned by those two migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Pagans <hi>Meridian</hi> and <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> who hadde with
them three score thousand horsemen, all of the <hi>Gran Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria,</hi>
meruailously well armed, although the most part of
them were armed with the hard skinnes of wilde beastes:
there were in this battaile, twentie braue and furious Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
whereof twelue of the most furious and ill fauored,
had no other charge, but to keepe the person of the worthie
Prince <hi>Meridian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The thirde battaile was giuen vnto the charge of the
king <hi>Orlan,</hi> and the king, <hi>Tiderio,</hi> who were two mightie

of <hi>Arabia, Carmania,</hi> and <hi>Palibotros,</hi> for that their gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
were slaine in the battaile past, all the which were to
the number of more then thrée score thousand, but yet verie
ill armed and nothing expert.</p>
               <p>The fourth battaile was giuen vnto the prince of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
who as you haue heard, was a young knight, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
valiant: He had in his companie three kings of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
who were verie fierce giants and stoute, and carryed
with them in charge foure score and tenne thousand horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
but not all mounted, vpon horses, but on other wilde
beastes, that were verie light and swift, and straunge to
be seene in that countrie.</p>
               <p>The fift battaile was giuen vnto the king <hi>Balardo,</hi>
Lorde of all the <hi>Seras,</hi> who was meruailously esteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all the Pagans, and feared, as well for his great
brauerie and fiercenesse, as that he was a mightie Lord and

kings, with all their people, which were to the number of
more then foure score thousand; he had also with him fiue
gyants, who being in the fore front of the battaile, seemed
aboue all the rest like vnto towers.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Alicandro,</hi> had for the gard and kéeping
of his person, twelue gyants, the most fiercest and missha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

neuer were out of his presence &amp; companie, day nor night,
so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Emperour, by reason of their great force &amp; strength,
dyd accompt himselfe in great securitie.</p>
               <p>He was meruailously feared of all his subiects, for that
who so euer disordered himselfe at any time in his prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
(although he were a king or mightie Lord) straight waies
those misshapen giants with battell ares of fine steele which

The most principall and strongest amongst them all,

that there was none that dyd behold him, but was afraide,

               <p>This <hi>Organte,</hi> the Emperour tooke a part and gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

armie, &amp; sayd, that they should put themselues into a thicke
wood, which was somewhat on the one side apart whereas
the battaile should be fought, and they should not goe forth
from thence, neither shew themselues, nor be séene, till such
time as he dyd send them word what they should doe. So
when that <hi>Organte</hi> the furious, was departed, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

many kings and mightie Lordes, who estéemed themselues

the other side the Pagans lost and had the worst. In this
sort the battaile mingled together, and on both parts was
done great slaughter, till such time as they ioyned with the
second battiles. But these worthie knightes séeing howe
their people were ouercome and fled before their enimies,
and the great destruction that was done vppon them, they
turned about their horses for to rescue them, and the knight
of the Sunne procured to come to that place whereas <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marant</hi>
was, and when that he came thether, one of those
Gyants that was with him, stroke so terrible a blowe at
the Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> vpon her helme, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it made her eies
to sparkle with fire, and againe if that she had not embraced
her selfe about her horse necke, she had falne to the ground.
But this Pagan dyd not aduaunce himselfe of that blow,
for that béeing séene by the knight of the Sunne, who was
all kindled in ire, with a mightie courage he raised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in his stirops, and stroke him such a blowe vppon his
left shoulder, with so great furie and force, that he cloue him
downe to the saddle bow, in such sorte that hee fell downe to
the ground in two péeces, with so great wonder vnto all
them that sawe that terrible blow, that they could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
with themselues that he shuld be a humane knight,
and the royall Princesse who verie well sawe the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that blow, was verie glad and ioyfull at her heart, for
that shée had so nigh her so valiant aide and succour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
almost ashamed to sée her selfe so euill intreated before
him, she tooke her sword in both her hands, and stroke such
a blow at another of the Gyants, (who had his sword in
the aire all aloft readie for to discharge it vpon her) that she
cut both his armes a sunder, that his hands, sword and all
fell to the ground, and the gyant ranne awaie and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the middest of the battaile, roaring and houling like
a Bull. From that time the worthie <hi>Alphebo</hi> and the roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Princesse so behaued themselues in the thickest amongst
their enimies, that what with killing and wounding all
that euer they could reach, in such sort, that they were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
feared of their aduersaries. At this time the good Troi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb facs="tcp:13995:193"/>
was not idle, but all to be raied with the bloud of them
that he had slaine, and at one terrible thrust which he threw
at one of the Gyant kings, hée passed his sword through his
bodie, so that hée fell downe dead to the ground. But when
that <hi>Bramarant</hi> sawe the great destruction the which these
thrée knightes made amongst his people, he rowled his
eies in his head as though fire would flie out of them, and
with great wrath he came towardes the knight of the Sun,
(for that it séemed vnto him that he was the knight that
stroke the mortallest blowes of all the rest) and when hée
came vnto him, he stroke him such a terrible and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart
blowe vppon his healme, that he made the sparkes
of fire to flie out a great waie off, and with the force there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it dazled his eies, and did somewhat astonish him, and
this infernall Pagan had not so soone stroke this blowe, but
that hée stroke another at the Princesse with so great furie,

that hée brake them and made the peeces to flie a great waie
of, so that all her one side was vnarmed and lefte naked.
Then the stout Troyan séeing his companions so euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
forcing himselfe with great courage, stroke such a
blowe at <hi>Bramarant</hi> vpon his healme, that he amazed him
in such sort, that his sword fell out of his handes, and hung
by the wrist band, the which blowe made this stout and
proude Pagan to knowe that his knight was of noble
bloud and courage. Then the knight of the Sunne, when
that he sawe his Ladie vnarmed, he went vnto her and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
her to depart out of the battaile to auoide the great
daunger and perill in the which shée was brought for lacke
of her armour. And therewith he left Oristedes in conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with <hi>Bramarant,</hi> and went with the Princesse to set her

that quietlie they cléered themselues out of the prease, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to depart from her knight) returned vnto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

she was honourablie receiued, and gaue great comfort vnto
all those Ladies and Gentlewomen. The knight of the Sun
returned againe into the battaile whereas he left the valiant
<hi>Oristedes,</hi> and found that the stout Pagan had ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
him vpon his horse crouper all astonied and amazed, and
as the Pagan would haue stroke him againe, the knight of
the Sunne put himselfe before him, and sayde: With mée
<hi>Bramarant</hi> thou viddest begin the battaile, therefore conclude
it with me before thou makest anie farther contention with
this knight. And in saying these wordes he stroke him such
an ouerthwart blow vpon the helme, that it seemed hée had
béene all on fire, with the burning sparkes and flames of fire
that flew out thereof, and the force was so great, that if hée
had not embraced himselfe with his horse necke, he had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
downe to the ground. Then this furious Pagan righted
vp himselfe againe, blaspheming against the heauens and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them that gaue so much power vnto nature, for to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
a knight of so great force and strength, and therewith
went against him, and began to charge him with such terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
blowes, that if it had bene some hard Marble rocke, in a
short space he had broke it all péeces, but yet the good armor
of the knight of the Sun was of so great force, that it wold
haue made resistance against a farre greater strength than
his, by reason of the finenesse of the bones of those little fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
which were found in the frosen sea, as you haue heard
before, wherewith the armour of the knight of the Sunne,
as also that of the Pagan were made, whereby we may sée
and vnderstand, how great and strange be the secrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that in so little bones nourished in the water, shoulde
make more greater and stronger resistance than anie yron
or stéele, so that these two worthie warriours being in such

Now héere let vs leaue them for a while in this their

the Tartarian <hi>Zoilo,</hi> did put themselues before their camp,
and setting spurres vnto their horses, went against them
that came in the second battaile, who likewise did mooue
themselues to receiue them. There came in their fore front
the Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> and the stout and strong Pagan <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimardo,</hi>

the noise was so great which they made at the breaking of

were at the Sea, in such sorte, that they set fire on manye
shippes that were in the Fléete, in spite of them that were
there, for that they found small resistance. Thus as I haue
saide before, when the Emperour came vnto the Sea side,
there was so great hast of embarking, that with great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
hée embarked himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into a shippe with those that
came with him, and being embarked, yet he thought not
himselfe in anie securitie, but in great hast caused the Sailes
to bée spread abroade, and launched themselues into the
Sea, leauing all this troupe and power ouerthrowen in
<hi>Grecia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> and <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> when
that they sawe how that the people were dispearsed, and
that by no meanes possible they coulde not staie them from
flying and running awaie. Then went they from one place
vnto another séeking of the Emperour <hi>Alycandro,</hi> but could
not finde him, till such time as they came vnto the Sea
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:13995:205"/>
side, whereas it was tolde them how that hée was embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
into a shippe, and departed with the Princesse <hi>Lynda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brides,</hi>
and the other Ladies and Gentlewomen that were
in her companie amongst whome was the faire Princesse
<hi>Floralinda,</hi> spouse vnto the Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> who when
that hée vnderstoode of their departure, dyd straight wayes
embarke himselfe in another shippe, and followed after
them.</p>
               <p>In all this while the Gréekes vnderstoode in no other
thing but in killing and slaying of Pagans as they ranne
awaie, and made such slaughter, as in all the daie before was
not the lyke, at which time all the water in the <hi>Tirreno</hi>
sea, from the <hi>

into the coulour of bloud, with the great quantitie that
were slaine as well on the sea as on the land, which was a
thing of great terrour and wonder to beholde. But the
knight of the Sunne when he sawe that the battaile was
dispearsed, and how that the Pagans sledde before them, hée
made no farther account of them, but went and sought for
the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> and the Princesse <hi>Lyndabrides;</hi>
fearing that in the moouing and running of the people they
should receiue some damage or harme. The which he would
not that it should so fall out for anie thing in all the world,
for that hée considered verie well in his minde how much he
was bound vnto them for the great loue which they bare
vnto him.</p>
               <p>And when he came vnto the Tents, he went from one
vnto another, enquiring for the Emperour, and it was tolde
him how they were fled and gone, wherewith he gallopped
his horse till hée came vnto the sea side, whereas hée sawe
the Pagans making great hast for to embarke themselues,
and many of them did swimme aboord, because they would
not abide the furie of the Greekes a land. Then the Knight
of the Sunne came vnto one of those Pagans, and put the
point of his sword to his face, and sayd that hee would kill
him, if hée dyd not tell him newes of the Emperour <hi>Aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candro.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13995:206"/>
Then the Pagan who sawe him depart for feare of death;
tolde him how that he was departed from thence in a ship,
with the princesse <hi>Lyndabrides</hi> and all her Ladies and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen.
Whereat when the knight of the Sunne heard
of their departure he was verie sorrowfull, as well for the
perill in the which they put themselues, as also for that hée
would haue done vnto them the honour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they deserued, and for that his valiant courage could not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that they should depart in such sorte, with a setled pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and determination full of vertue, he put himselfe into
a Boate, and caused the Marriners to rowe him vnto a good
ship that was there at hande, whereas he found certaine
knights that did resist him at his entrie, whom he slew, and
threatned the Maister and Marriners that he woulde lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
kill them if they did not gouerne the ship right that
waie which the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> was departed and
gone.</p>
               <p>Then they who sawe the great destruction that hée had
made in so short a time, being greatlie amazed thereat, and
with great fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

through that bloudie sea, whereas we wil leaue them in

field.</p>
               <p>At this time the good Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> when he saw
the night come on a pace, and that it waxed darke, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

heard, at which sound all his people dyd obey his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
and gathered themselues together. But yet in all
this time the battaile betwixt <hi>Rosicleer</hi> and <hi>Bramarant</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ceased, but rather as then was more furious and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in wrath, and they did no other thing but procure to
charge the one the other with their terrible blowes, all that
euer they could. At which time <hi>Bramarant</hi> thought not that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:13995:206"/>
the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> had bene spoiled and lost the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
but rather suspected that the Greekes had lost the field,
but verie quicklie hée was put out of that doubt, for that by
reason of the great noise which they made in their battaile,
the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> and all those worthie Princes that
were on his part, came thether whereas they were, for as
then they were all ioyned together, &amp; put themselues round
about these two warriours, with determination for to part
them from that contension: but this valiant and worthie
pagan when he saw them in that sort, and knew them, hee
was greatly amazed, and straight waies suspected that they
had got the victorie, who as then with a hoarse voyce and
proude semblant, sayd. Oh fortune, how is it that thou hast
had so great power, for to shew thy selfe so contrarie against
the pagans: who is that mightie and valiant prince that
hath had so great force for to ouerthrow the mightie <hi>Alican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>
and the <hi>gran Campion</hi> my father, who was sufficient
to set fier on all the whole worlde. To whome <hi>Rosicleer</hi>
answered and said, if thou wilt know him it is easie to bee
vnderstood, for I doe giue thée to vnderstand that all which
is here done, commeth alonely of him, that dyd create and
make all things, and hath power ouer all men, and at his
will is gouerned both nature and fortune. And this is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ true God and man, in whome all christians doe
beleeue and worship: and it hath bene his pleasure to giue
vs the victorie against so many thousands of Pagans, by
the which thou maist vnderstand, how false and deceiuable
be your Gods, who were not able for to ayde and succour
the Emperour <hi>Alicandro,</hi> who presumeth to desend from
the race, and stocke. Then this proude Pagan replyed and
sayde, I neuer beleeued in any gods, neither am I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to beleeue in any, for that both their gods &amp; thyne,
and all the rest, I holde them for my enimies, and I will
spoyle them all where soeuer I may finde or méete with
them. And in saying these words he raysed himselfe in his
stirrups, and with his sword in both his hands he stroke so
strong a blow at <hi>Rosicleer</hi> vppon his inchaunted healme,
<pb facs="tcp:13995:207"/>
that it séemed a Thunderbolt to haue fallen from heauen,
the noyse was so great, which made him somewhat astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
But when this Pagan sawe that he was compassed
about with so much people, &amp; that it was night, he thought
it not good to abide there anie longer, but set spurres vnto
his horse, and rushed thorough the thickest of them, &amp; ouer,
threw to the ground all them that was in his way, &amp; lyke a
whirle winde he runneth through those fields, and neuer
stayed till he came into the wildernesse of Grecia, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
not to depart from thence till such time as he hadde
very well and to his contentment reuenged the death of his
father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rosicleer</hi> would verie faine haue followed him, for that
he hadde a great desire for to conclude and giue ende vnto
that battaile, but the Emperour his father and those that
were with him dyd distrube him. Then when they sawe
themselues together, and missed the knight of the Sunne,
they were greatly amazed, and seperated themselues some
one way and some an other waye, and went into all places
for to séeke him: but when that in all the whole field they
could not finde him, they could not immagine where hée
should bée, for the which they were all very sad and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but in especiall the royall princes <hi>Claridiana,</hi> for that
she thought euery hower a yéere till she hadde spoken with
him, and trauailed from one place to an other with great

               <p>When she heard this, she was somewhat quieted in

great pomp and force they entred into the Empire of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
&amp; with what disgrace they departed from thence, their
hearts were readie to breake with sorrrw, for that they saw

onely the water of the Sea, couered with bloud, and a few
other shippes full of people that had escaped from the furie

daunger to be drowned, so that the marriners and such as
were in the shippe, had enough to doe, for to voyde and cast
out the water, that was forced in by that tempest, and the
faire princesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> with all her ladies and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,
receiued so great feare that they all amased remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as dead persons: although vnto this faire princesse,
the griefe was not so much in beholding before her eyes,
that great perill of death in the which they were brought,
as to sée her selfe in that sorte for to depart from Grecia,
where as remained the knight of the Sunne: and againe
to consider how euell her purpose and desire was brought
to passe, so that she remained without all hope or remedie.
And prayed vnto her gods and fortune, not to appease the
torment, but to be so contrarie vnto their iourney, that they
might retourne againe (by the force thereof) into Grecia,
either a liue or dead: for that she thought in her heart, that
there was no death could be more crueller vnto her, then to
retourne into her owne countrie whereas she should lose
all hope euer for to sée the knight of the Sunne. In this
sort vttering great and profound sighes, which procéeded
from the bottome of her heart, she sayd as followeth.</p>
               <p>Oh my soule, depart and leaue this my sorowfull and

of the Sunne hearing of my death, will not be so cruell but
that he will giue sepulture vnto this my vnhappie bodie,
and at times remember mée, and be sorrowfull for this my
vntimely and cruell death. Ah when that this shall lacke

               <p>In vttering of these and manie other things of great
griefe, did this sorrowfull princesse nauigate, and with so
great trouble of minde, that I doe verelie beleeue, if the
knight of the Sunne had heard them, he would haue hadde
great compassion on her. Likewise it was of no lesse sorow
&amp; griefe to sée the demeanour of the Emperour <hi>Alicandro,</hi>
for that the day before he saw himselfe in the estate to bée
lord ouer all the whole world, and at this present for to be
a land in his owne countrie, he would haue bene content
to haue had the gouernement, and to be lorde of a poore ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell:
an estate vnlooked for, &amp; they that doe thinke to sléepe
in great securitie, whome fortune hath put in the highest
part of her mouable and inconstant whéele, they may well
behold this Emperour, for that possible he may be vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a greater securitie, and cause them to loose the condicion of
hope that alwayes they had in her, for that alwaies when
that she dothe once beginne to frowne and to tourne her
back vnto any, she is not content to touch them with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
aduersitie, but will so follow them, as their fall shalbe
equal vnto their first triumph of exalting, as by experience
you shall sée in this Emperour, who was not content to
bring him into this estate of perplexitie, but straight waies
did ordaine a greater and crueller conclusion greatly to be
considered of: for that the next day in the morning at such
time as the Sunne did arise, the furious force of the windes
and seas, did carrie their ship into the port of any land, with
so great extremitie, that it brake all to péeces, and they with
great trauaile escaped, being all wet, out of comfort, and in
<pb facs="tcp:13995:209"/>
a place vnknowen, and for that you shalbe certified of the
comfort and ease that they found there. You shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that this was called the strong Ilande, the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in all the <hi>Tirreno</hi> Sea, it is called strong, for that it
is all compassed round about with the Sea, &amp; on the parts
towards the sea, high and mightie Rockes, and hath no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into it but onely one part, in the which the Emperor
<hi>Alicandro</hi> and his companie were driuen by force of that
great tempest: at the entrie of the same sort, was two great
high and mightie towers, and of great strength, and at the
foote of them into the Iland, a great and large plaine, in
the which was manie gallant peaceable and freshe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
that dyd inuite all them that passed by, to take their
ease and repast, and beyond the same plaine, there was a
beautifull mountaine, vppon the which was edified a verie

vpon the which was a drawen bridge of timber, and before
the same a gallant little plaine in maner of &amp; court. The

some towards the Sea, and others towards the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of the saide Castell, so that for strength and beautie,
in all the whole Sea, was not an Iland to be found equall

edified and made by arte of inchantment.</p>
               <p>The Lord of this Iland was a Gyant, called <hi>Roboan,</hi>

And for the executing of the same, they hadde caused to be
made betwixt the two towers in a verie faire plaine, a rich

knées, and apparailed with white garments, and a towell
vpon his shoulder, did make this Sacrifice, cutting of the
heads of those damsels and knights with a broade &amp; sharpe
knife. This order and custome was maintained and kept in
that Iland by the auncestors of <hi>Roboan,</hi> euer since the time
that they fell into that diuelish Idolatrie. And this <hi>Robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>

the higher of bloud that those damsels &amp; knights were that

they pardoned none although she were a Quéene. Two of

The other two were continually at the Sea, apprehending
and taking prisoners all that euer they dyd méete, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
taken any pray, they returned vnto the Iland. Their
father <hi>Roboan,</hi> was in the castle with his wife, who was
lady Gyantesse, and many times he would descend vnto his
sonnes in the two towers, &amp; they likewise vnto the castell,
when that it was their pleasure for to méete. This was the
Iland whereas the Emperour <hi>Alicandro</hi> with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse

possessed with so rich a praie of damsels, went vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Castle with them, sauing one damsell of the Princes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
(for that she would not sée her selfe in the power of those
Gyantes) woulde put her lyfe in aduenture for to escape
from them, and ranne and put her selfe amongst a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of Rockes, whose fortune was so fauourable (for that
there was a great number of them) that she was not séene,
so that she remained there all alone hidden amongest the

               <p>And héere you shall vnderstand that this was the

were carried into the Castle, <hi>Roboan</hi> receiued great ioy and
pleasure for the rich praie, and it seemed vnto him that the
Princesse <hi>Lyndabrides</hi> was the fairest creature that euer he
had séene in all his life, and he sayd that with the bloud of so
high a Damsell, their Goddes the Moone, shoulde receiue
great contentment, and cause the fruits of their Countrie to
bring forth in greater abundaunce than heeretofore it hath
done, and commanded straight waies that they should be put
in holde and good assurance, their prison was ordained in the
highest part of all the Castle, whereas were great galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and battlements, from whence they might discerne all
the whole Iland, and a great part of the Sea. But when
that the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> sawe himselfe prisoner vnto
such euill and vnmercifull people, and well vnderstoode to
what end they were prisoners, you may well iudge the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

Lorde ouer so many Countries, and of power more than
anie one in all the whole worlde, and now to bée prisoner in
the custodie and power of them that at his first entrie heard
the sentence of his death. The Princesse <hi>Lyndabrides</hi> of
this imprisonment receiued no great griefe, for that shée
<pb facs="tcp:13995:211"/>
was not farre parted from the Empire of <hi>Grecia,</hi> but dyd
comfort her selfe verie much, for that shée hoped in some
time for to sée the knight of the Sunne, being in that place,
and not in the <hi>gran Tartaria,</hi> whether as her Father dyd
carrie her. And she said within her selfe, that forasmuch as
in that land they dyd commit and vse so greate crueltie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Ladies and damsells, it could not be, but at one time
or at another, it should come vnto the eares and hearing of
the knight of the Sunne, who was of so valiant a courage

himselfe to take awaie that great crueltie and disobedience
against God, and had so great confidence in his worthinesse

bée at the Sea, with that great storme and tempest, whose
great feare béeing manifest vnto the Knight of the Sunne,
hee was verie desirous to knowe the occasion thereof, and
they declared the cause, verie much extolling the force and
<pb facs="tcp:13995:212"/>
strength of <hi>Roboan,</hi> and of his sonnes, as also of the great
crueltie that was vsed there, with such knights and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells
as they did take. And although the knight of the Sun
would first haue accomplished his voyage in following of
the Emperour <hi>Alycandro,</hi> and haue left that enterprise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
some other time, yet for all that, séeing that it woulde
lyttle profite for to returne vnto the Sea, by reason that
the waues were greatlie increased with the force of the
storme, hée determined with himselfe to go a land, and in the
meane time till it pleased God to appease the rage of the
weather, he would put in practise to sée if hée could doe anie
thing against those people, for to cause them to breake that
euill and diuellish custome, and as hée was determined
within himselfe, hée put it in vre, but the marriners would
not enter into the Port, nor boord their ship aland with a
good will, but he did so threaten them that he made them by
force to doe all that he commanded.</p>
               <p>When that hée was a land, and had not well mounted
vpon his horse, (which was that which hée wonne from the
king of the <hi>Gandaros</hi> in the battaile,) there came forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him ten knightes on horsebacke, and as many on
foote, all armed, with their hatchets of armes in their hands,
and bad him to yéeld to them as prisoner, and some of them
approched to laie hands on his horse bridle. But this good
knight answered not one worde vnto these villanous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but hauing his Speare in his hande, stroke one of them
such a blowe therewith, that his strong armour dyd not
profite him, but hée ouerthrew him backwardes starke dead
vnto the ground, and as one that as then was not to learne
to shedde the bloud of such vnhappie wretches, in a short
time hée made such slaughter amongest them, that there
escaped no more aliue but thrée of them, who fledde and
ranne with all hast possible vnto the Castle, which was
vppon the little mountaine, whereas were the two oldest
bretheren, <hi>Langereon</hi> and <hi>Andricardo,</hi> with <hi>Roboan</hi> their
Father, for that after that they had carried prisoner vnto
the Castell the Emperour <hi>Alycandro,</hi> and his companie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:13995:212"/>
that time they had not descended vnto their Towers,
whereas they were wont to bée continuallie, which was
the occasion that the knight of the Sunne was not assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but by their Knightes and footmen, who remayned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
in the Towers for to kéepe and defend them, for that
all the rest were gone into the Castell with their riche
praie.</p>
               <p>But when the knight of the Sunne sawe himselfe
cléere of all those that came forth against him, and that
there came no more people out of the Towers, hee imagined
within himselfe that the Gyantes shoulde bée in that highe
Castle, which hée sawe before him somewhat a farre off,
which caused him to take the waie thetherwardes, and it
seemed vnto him to bee one of the most fayrest and strongest
that euer before hee had séene, and as yet hée was not come
vnto the plaine that was before the entrie, which was in
manner of a Court, when that hee sawe come forth of the
Castle by a false doore one of the Gyantes, all armed with
thicke plates of stéele, and mounted vppon a mightie, great,
and strong horse, with a great cutting hatchet of Steele in
his handes, who seemed vnto the knight of the Sunne to
bée one of the best furnished, and well made and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Gyants that euer hee saw in all his lyfe. And this was
<hi>Langereon</hi> the eldest and most valyantest of all the foure
brethren, who béeing aduertised by one of them that ranne
awaie, of the great slaughter and destruction that that alone
knight had made amongst his people, he issued out to séeke
him, for to take reuengement of the same, and at such time
as the knight of the Sunne came into the plaine ground,
by the Castell, the Gyant approched nigh vnto him, and
lyfte vp the beauer of his healme. But when hée sawe him
of so bigge and gallant proportion, and considered the
newes which his men had declared vnto him, hée helde
him straight wayes in reputation, and thought him to bée
a knight of a most singular and valyant courage, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no account of him, he said.</p>
               <p>By thy vnaduised ariuall and comming hether (Sir
<pb facs="tcp:13995:213"/>
Knight) I doe vnderstand that thou knowest not who is
Lord of this Iland, neither the vse and custome that is héere
maintained, for if thou haddest béene aduertised thereof,
then wouldest thou not haue come hether to séeke him, whom
thou hast so much grieued and angered in the slaying of
his knightes. With as little feare and gallant semblaunce
as hée spake, the knight of the Sunne aunswered him and
sayd.</p>
               <p>Gyant, I doe verie well know, that this is the strong I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and how that <hi>Roboan</hi> is Lord of the same, who ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
with his sonnes doth maintaine so euill and abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a custome, that whatsoeuer good knight hée bée, he ought
for to aduenture his lyfe for to cause the same to be broken,
as well in the great Idolatrie vsed in the worshipping for
God his creatures, as also in the great crueltie vsed agaynst
all knightes and damsells, so that I am come hether, and
haue so great hope and confidence in the diuine iustice, to
doe so much, that you shall not perseuer with this great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and if that thou art <hi>Roboan</hi> or anie of his sonnes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
and put order to amend thy life, or else come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlie
with me to battaile.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Langereon</hi> with great laughter and disdaine,
said: Of truth (Sir Knight) thy great boldnesse and courage
is the greatest that euer I haue heard or seene, that thou
hast so valiant a heart for to approch and giue attempt in
that which all the whole world is not sufficient, but because
thou shalt sée and vnderstand that thy attempt is more of
follie than of anie valiant courage or feare, doe now what
thou canst against me, for that I am one of the sonnes of
<hi>Roboan,</hi> whom thou hast named. And in saying these words
this worthie and valiant youth did lift vp his great tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheant
and stéelie hatchet, and therewith went towardes
the knight of the Sunne, with so terrible and dreadfull
semblance, that it was sufficient to put great feare in anie
good Knight. But vnto him who had béene accustomed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such lyke enterprises, it was not onelie without feare
and dreade, but also a Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:13995:213"/>
and taken from one of those knightes which hée stew, hée
threw vnto the ground, and drew out his sword, and went
towardes <hi>Langereon,</hi> who was greatlie amazed at that
which hée did, so that these two the one against the other
charged each his aduersarie with such terrible blowes vpon
their healmes, that with the great force thereof they caused
per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

reason that the healme of the Gyant was not of so fine met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
as it should haue béene, it was clouen by the knight of
the Sunne, in such sorte, that hée made a lyttle wounde in
his scull, out of the which procéeded great abundaunce of
bloud that fell in his eyes, and about his face, the which did
disturbe him verie much in this battaile, and this <hi>Lange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reon</hi>
meruailed exceedinglie at that terrible blowe which he
had receiued, which was the mightiest that euer in all his

about his head, and with it in both his handes hée stroke so

Tower had fallen vpon him, it so amazed and astonied him,
and with a trice hee redoubled another blowe with no
lesse force and strength, with the which the knight of the
Sunne had passed great daunger, if that he had stroke it
full and right, but with the force and strength that hée put
in striking of the first blowe, the bloud of the wound in his

downe about his eyes, in such sorte, that whereas hée
thought to haue stroken the worthie and valyant knight

                  </gap>ell of the saddle, that without anie staying
hee cut him cleane asunder in the middest, so that he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him in two péeces, and hee straight wayes fell
downe dead vnto the grounde, whereby hée was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned
to ouerthrowe his Maister: but this valiant
<pb facs="tcp:13995:214"/>
knight was not so soone fallen, but he arose vp againe on
his féete, and meruailed greatlie at the mightie force of the
Gyant, and seeing himselfe so intreated, he sayde within
himselfe, that it did well appeare, that there was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
his Ladie and Mistres the Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> for that
one alone knight had brought him vnto that extremitie.
And in saying these wordes he did abide the comming of
<hi>Langareon,</hi> who approched with his hatchet aboue his head
for to strike him another terrible blowe, and at such time
as he would haue discharged the same, he stepped on the one
side with so great dexteritie, that the blowe fell downe to
the ground, and as the Gyant by reason of the force where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it was stroke, dyd bowe his bodie and armes after the
same, the Knight of the Sunne laide holde on the gorget of
his healme with so greate strength, that hee brake the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings
and buckles thereof, and pulled it from his head, and
ouerthrew him from his horse to the ground, and before
that hée could arise, hee stroke him with his healme vppon
his vnarmed head, that hée astonied him, and layde him a

euill, hée left him, and tooke his hatchet and mounted
vpon his horse, the which was both bigge and verie swift.
And looking towardes the Castle to see if another did come
forth, hée chaunced to cast his eyes vp vnto the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
therof, whereas hee discouered the persons of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Alycanidro,</hi> and the fayre Princesse <hi>Lyndabrides,</hi>
and some of her Ladies and Gentlewomen, who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
and dyd sée all that passed in the battayle with the
Gyant, and by reason that all his armour was berayed and
imbrued in bloud, and neuer made cleane since the greate
battayle that was fought in <hi>Grecia,</hi> and againe, that he had
not his horse <hi>Cornerino,</hi> they coulde not imagine or deuise
who he shoulde bée, but the Princesse <hi>Lyndabrides</hi> sayde
within her selfe.</p>
               <p>Oh how I would pardon and forgiue fortune all these
trauailes and aduersities which she hath giuen vnto mée,
that my fortune might nowe bée so good and happie,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:13995:214"/>
that this might be the myrrour of all knights, or his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Rosicleer,</hi> or some of his friendes, that might doe so
much, in this Iland, as to carrie vs prisoners into <hi>Grecia.</hi>
But when that the knight of the Sunne dyd sée that faire
and rubic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd face of the Princesse, he was not so greatlie
troubled with the mightie and terrible blowes which he
hadde receiued of the Gyant, as he was for to see her, who
some times was gouernesse of his heart, in that place: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he trembled and shaked, striking himselfe vpon the
brest, as one that walketh by night in securitie and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feare discouereth vpon a sodaine, some vision or fantasie
before him. And being somewhat amased, he remained a
good while, beholding her, without mouing of hand or foote,
that he thought all his sences were disturbed, with the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
sight of this faire Princesse, whose beautie was so
rooted within his heart, and the olde sore so festered, that of
truth it was very hard and euell to be healed, if that the
wisedome of <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> and <hi>Artimidoro,</hi> with others more
auncienter then they, had not put remedie in the same, for
that the valour of this precious princesse was such, that the
knight of the Sunne in her presence, could neuer haue his
frée libertie. And being in this maze <hi>Andricardo,</hi> the second
brother came forth out at the castell gate, all armed with
very thick armour of hardened stéele, and mounted vpon a
mightie horse, who was of no lesse stature and bignesse then
the first: but when that the knight of the Sunne did sée
him, he saide within himselfe, that neuer in all his life he
saw giants of so gallant proporcion, nor of so great force &amp;
strength as <hi>Langereon</hi> seemed to haue. But when that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dricardo</hi>
approched and saw his brother lye along vpon the
earth, thinking that he had bene dead, it could not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined
the great sorrow and griefe he receiued, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him with so great furie and lightnesse, as the arrow
that is forced out of abowe, to throw at the knight of the
Sunne a mightie great boare speare which he brought in
his hands, that if his armour had not bene that of <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
it had passed his bodie through and through to the other
<pb facs="tcp:13995:215"/>
side, for that it stroke him in the middest of his breast with
so great strength, that it made him to double his bodie back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
vpon his horse crouper, and for that the stéelie pointe
could not enter into his armour, it doubled &amp; recoiled backe
againe, and the shéeuers flew into the aire, making a greate
noise, but this good knight with great lightnesse did settle
himselfe againe in his saddle, and remembred that the faire
Princesse <hi>Lyndabrides</hi> did behold him, and therewith went
against <hi>Andricandro,</hi> with his hatchet in both his handes, &amp;
stroke him so mightie a blow vpon his healme, that if it had
chanced to be a full blow, he had clouen him downe vnto the
wast, but it chanced somewhat aside, in such sort, that it cut
awaie a péece of the helme with one of his cares, and from
thence descended his fine cutting hatchet along his breast,
cutting all that was before it, till it came to the saddle bow,
the which it cloue asunder, and cut his horse almost in two
péeces, so that he fell downe dead to the ground with his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and caught one of his legges vnder him, in such sorte,
that what with the wound that hée had on his breast, and
the doubling of his legge, hée could not by anie meanes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise,
but was the greatest amazed man in all the worlde, to
see that terrible and wonderfull blowe the which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
and it séemed to bée done by a knight of the biggest
force that was to bée found in anie parte of the vniuersall
world.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Roboan</hi> who was all armed, and at a windowe
beholding the battaile, when that he sawe his sonnes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
and in that perplexitie, it coulde not be expressed the
great sorow and griefe which he receiued, for that he thought
it a thing impossible, that ten of the best knightes that were
to be found in all the world, were not able to do that which
was there done, and thinking in a short space to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for the same, he mounted vpon a mightie horse, and tooke
a great speare in his hand, and went forth at the Castle gate
with so furious and terrible a semblance, that the knight of
the Sunne did verie well perceiue that he was of no lesse
force and strength than his two sonnes, for that he was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:13995:215"/>
of person, and bigger of members, and when that he came
nigh vnto the knight of the Sunne, with a hoarse &amp; terrible
voice, he sayd.</p>
               <p>Knight, tell me who art thou of such courage and hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that hauing slaine my two sonnes, darest abide mée in
the field? I am a knight (said he) that in the name of Iesus
Christ, in whom I doe beléeue and worship, doe hope to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroie
thée, and all those that are obedient vnto thy lawe, for
that the diuine iustice beeing angrie at the great sinnes
and euils by thée done in this Iland, is now come to punish
thée according vnto thy deserts, in the déepest partes of hell.
Oh Goddesse, the creator of all Gyantes, and the bringer
forth of all the fruites vppon the earth, (answered <hi>Roboan)</hi>
how canst thou suffer that one alone knight shall saie that he
will destroie thy lawe, and maketh a mocking stocke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at.
In saying these wordes he spurred forwardes with his
horse, and stroke him such a blowe with his speare in the
middest of his breast, that he would haue sworne, that the
point with halfe the staffe would haue appeared at his back,
but it fell not out according vnto his thought, for at the force
thereof he made no more mention nor mouing thereat, than
if he had stroke against a tower, but with his mightie hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
he repaied him in such sort, that a mightie great and thick
shéeld, that he had, wherewith he would haue warded that
blow, he cut in two péeces, and the blowe descended vppon
his healme, cutting the same, and also a steele cap which hee
had vnder it, and made a cruell wound in his head, and as
they ioyned with their bodies verie nigh the one the other,
the Gyant laide holde with his armes about his necke, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
by his great force and strength to hoise him out of the
saddie, but he that was indued with no lesse strength than
he, and with more dexteritie, laide hold on him by the wast,
&amp; held him so fast, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by reason their horses pressed forwards,
they both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell to the ground, and let go their holds, &amp; rose vp
vpon their feet. The knight of the Sun drew out his sword
&amp; the gyant a great fauchon, so that they began the battaile
a foot, &amp; made so great noise, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they were heard throughout
<pb facs="tcp:13995:216"/>
the whole Iland, and it séemed that there were in battaile
together, more then one hundreth knights. Here was to be
séene the great fortitude and strength of <hi>Roboan,</hi> who dyd
combat in such sort with the knight of the Sunne, that he
troubled him very much, and many times his vnmeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
blowes did put him in great perill, and had brought him
into much more danger, if that the great strength and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his armour, and his great lightnesse, had not holpen
him. There was also an other thing that dyd profit him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
much, which was y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> great furie of his temerous blowes,
which made the Gyant to besturre himselfe from one part
vnto an other, for to cléere himselfe from the furie of them,
with more lightnesse then his bigge and great bodie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
So that after halfe an houre that the battaile was
begonne, his vnwildy bodie not being able to indure anie
longer, waxed weake &amp; feeble, by reason of certaine wounds
which he had receiued, out of the which issued verie much
bloud, in so great aboundance, that all the ground was stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
there with. At which time the knight of the Sunne
considering, that if the battaile shold goe forwards, it wold
not be well with <hi>Roboan:</hi> and againe, for that he had him
and his sonnes in respect of strong and valiant knights, &amp;
for such would estéeme them, if that he might cause them
to leaue this great errour the which they had maintained a
long time, he there with all withdrew himselfe aback, and
lifting vp the beauer of his healme he said. Heare mée a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
what I will say vnto thée <hi>Roboan,</hi> first before that this
our battaile be finished, thou shalt vnderstand that I doe
estéeme thee and thy sonnes verie much, as wel for the great
valiantnesse that is in you, as also you doe séeme vnto mee
to be good and courteous knights: my will and desire is,
that this our battaile betwixt vs may cease, and that reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
be put in the curing these thy wounds, and the wounds
of thy sonnes, in case that thou wilt leaue this law <hi>Gentili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
wherewith thou hast bene so much deceiued, and from
this day forwardes not to obserue nor maintaine the euell
and most cruell custome, as hetherto thou hast. For that if
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:13995:216"/>
thou wilt sée and behold with the eyes of thy vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and consider of the law in the which thou doest liue,
thou shalt cléerely sée and perceiue the great errour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
wherein thou art wrapped. Tell mee I pray thee <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boan,</hi>
who ought to be honored and worshipped for God,
but he alonely that created and made all things both ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall
and terrestriall, and hath power ouer all things, for to
punish the wicked, and to gratifie and reward the good and
iust. Well then, if he alone that hath all this power, ought
to be estéemed, honoured and worshipped, for God, what
reason is there for to beleue that the Moone is the Goddesse.
Thou shalt vnderstand for her to shine and giue light, hath
neede of the cléerenesse and brighnesse of the Sunne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the which, of her selfe she is verie darke and obscure,
and cannot be séene. God created the high couloured Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,
the gréene Emeralds, the blew Saphires, the white
Pearles, the shining beams of the Sunne, that giueth light
vnto the Moone, the Starres, the gréene trées on the earth,
and her Plants, the quietnesse of the heauens, the round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the world, and the meruailous course of the celestial
mouings, not for that we should occupie our wits and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
in these things: but by the great beautie and
sight of them, our spirits may be moued vnto the beautie
and loue of the creator and maker of all them, from whom
like as from a fountaine, procedeth all that is faire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable
vnto the sight of man. In the meane time that the
knight of the Sunne was saying these words, <hi>Roboan</hi> was
very attentiue, taking as great pleasure, at that he sayde, as
at his great force and strength, and looking vpon himselfe,
he sawe that he was berayed with bloud and his armour
broken in many places, and his aduersarie not to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
any wound, but rather was more stronger and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then at the beginning, which was vnto him apparant,
either to be slaine, or to loose the victorie. Likewise he well
vnderstood to what ende the knight of the Sunne had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
those words, which did procéede more of vertue &amp; good
will towards them, then for any feare or dread he had in
<pb facs="tcp:13995:217"/>
the conclusion of the battaile: but by reason that he saw his
sonnes lying a long on the ground in the field, the eyes of
his vnderstanding were so blinded, that he could not sée the
great profit which might come vnto him in leauing of his
law and custome. And said vnto the knight of the Sun,
that he should not speake any thing more therof vnto him,
for that he was determined to follow and take his fortune,
whether it were good or bad, against him, or with him. And
therewith they both retourned againe vnto the battaile, &amp;
for that they had somewhat breathed &amp; rested themselues,
it was then a thing worthie to be seene, the strong and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
blowes which the one stroke at the other. For as I
haue said, <hi>Roboan</hi> was a stout and strong giant, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
of himselfe to destroye and kill one hundreth knights
that should contend against him altogether in battaile.
The knight of the Sunne had great desire quickly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
and make an ende of that contension, to sée what the
Emperour <hi>Alicandro</hi> and the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> dyd
in the castell, who being greatly amazed at his great force
and strength, could not immagine who it should be, except
it were the sonne of <hi>Trebatio,</hi> he who had done great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nailes
in his presence. And he that should at this instant
haue certified the faire princesse, how that it was the knight
of the Sunne, you may well beleeue that he should haue
caused her to receiue greater ioye and contentment, then if
they had giuen her all the whole world for a present, as she
who should not receiue so great griefe, if her soule should
depart from her bodie, as she should receiue in departing
from the countrie whereas doth remaine her knight of the
Sunne, who dyd so much against <hi>Roboan,</hi> that in the ende
of one houre, that the battaele was begun, he fell downe a
long at his féete, so séeble and weake, by reason of the great
quantitie of bloud, that he had lost, that till such time as
the knight of the Sunne did pull of his healme, and gaue
him ayre, he could not come againe vnto himselfe. But
when that he was in his remembraunce, the knight of the
Sunne florishing with his sworde aboue his head, sayde,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:13995:217"/>
with this sword will I seperate thy head and bodie a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if that thou wilt not amend thy lyfe, and apart thy selfe
from the law, wherein thou hast liued hetherto.</p>
               <p>The feare of death (sayd <hi>Roboan)</hi> shall not make mée
to doe any thing that is against my honour, but thy great
vertue and force, doth make mée to beléeue that thy law and
faith is better then this, the which I haue hetherto main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
in the which I doe confesse greatly to haue erred and
bene deceiued. And here I doe promise thée in the faith of
whome I am, and by the high bloud from whence I doe
descend, neuer to maintaine any longer this euill custome,
but will esteeme and worshippe for my God all the dayes of
my life, him whome thou hast tolde mée off, who vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
did create all things.</p>
               <p>Then the knight of the Sunne who was very glad and
ioyfull for to heare him so say, dyd healp him to arise from
the ground, and embrasing him with great loue, they went
both together vnto <hi>Andricardo</hi> and <hi>Langereon,</hi> whom they
found both a liue and without perill, but that they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
weake and féeble, with the great quantitie of bloud the
which they had lost: but when the sonnes had vnderstood
all that which had passed with their Father, God had inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his holy spirit within them, in such sort, that they were
very well content therewith, and premised him that from
that day forwards, they would hold him for their Lord and
verie friend, and requested him to tell them, who he was, &amp;
how he was called. Unto whome he saide, that they should
goe vnto the castell and there in the presence and before his
prisoners he would giue them to vnderstand. And therwith
they went all foure together vnto the castel, and being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they mounted vp vnto the battelments whereas the
Emperour, and faire princesse, with her damsells were. And
when they came vnto them, the knight of the Sunne pulled
of his healme, and kneeled downe before the Emperor &amp; the
princesse y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> were together aparted from the rest, &amp; with that
graue &amp; merrie countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he was wont to haue, he spake
these words. If the errors don by the knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sun could
<pb facs="tcp:13995:218"/>
moue the generositie of your hearts, to come with so great
wrath accompanied with so mightie a number of knights,
into <hi>Grecia,</hi> for to take reuengement of me alone, behold
mée here now vnder your obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for that with this sword
straight waies you giue mée my reward, as my desort doth
deserue, for greater force to this effecte hath the greate loue
and good will which alwaies I beare vnto you, then all the
great and mightie armies, which you ordained to passe the
Seas, for that to counteruaile them an other force equall
is sufficient for to destroy them, but against the good will
which alwayes I had for to serue you, there is no force, nor
peruerse fortune sufficient for to oppresse the same: and if
hetherto my Lords, I haue séemed vnto you to vse the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
for that I made resistance against your in these bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes
passed, it was not for to excuse mee to be yours, but
to withstand that the Emperour of <hi>Grecia</hi> were not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroyed: and againe, that they should not suffer &amp; abide
the smart, that were nothing in the fault hereof. In the
meane time that the knight of the Sunne was saying these
words, the faire Princesse did beholde him as though she
had bene transported, or from her selfe with the soueraigne
ioye and pleasure which prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly she receiued, to sée before
her with so great humilitie, him whome she loued much
more then her owne selfe, and his fight so greatly wished &amp;
desired for. But when that the Emperour <hi>Alicandro</hi> dyd
know the knight of the Sunne, and had well vnderstoode
his humble and courteous words, who could immagine or
coniecture the great admiration and wonder that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in his heart, with the varietie of diuers things that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
his minde and vnderstanding at one instant. For
one waye he called to remembrance, that once he thought
that this knight should haue bene his sonne, and how that
he gaue vnto him his daughter, Empire and high estate.
Likewise he remembred to the contrarie, how that for to
be reuenged on him, he left his owne countries, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a great number of people into <hi>Grecia</hi> whereas
happened vnto him all his ill fortunes and ouerthrowes.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:13995:218"/>
he remembred also how that he sawe him in the fielde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him with so great furie and fiercenesse, that hée alone
did make to quake all his great and mightie armie, and
how that by his rigorous arme the most principallest kings
and Lordes of all his hoast were destroyed and hewen to
péeces, and now likewise he sawe him vppon his knées be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his presence with so great humilitie, that more coulde
not be done by his sonne <hi>Meridian,</hi> if at that present he had
béene there. In this sort was his minde troubled and tossed
withall these thoughts, which was the occasion, that he stood
and did beholde him without speaking of anie word a good
space, till such time as comming vnto himselfe, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that he was the Myrrour of all Princes and knights
in the world, and as then thought him to bée equall vnto
the eternall Gods, and that his great valour &amp; estate would
not suffer that he should continue in that sort before him, he
determined to consent and to suffer with patience, all that
was ordained by fortune, and to accept and receiue the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of his imprisonment at the handes of him, who hath
béene the occasion of all his euill, but in especiall the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
in the which he was brought, woulde not giue waie
vnto anie other thing, so that he went vnto him, and did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brase
him, and kissed his chéeke, and in shedding of many
teares that ranne downe his chéekes, hée vttered these
wordes.</p>
               <p>WOrthie Prince and welbeloued sonne, I am he that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onelie
haue erred, &amp; most worthelie doth deserue the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
for the great quantitie of bloud which I haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to bee shedde of those that were without fault or blame,
for I may well knowe and vnderstand, that whome the
Gods dyd make of so great magnanimitie aboue all others
in the whole worlde, it cannot bee but Fortune must bée
fauourable vnto him and vnto mee the contrarie, for that
I will maintaine against him the warre and contention,
yea, and besides all this, the destini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shall be set al libertis out of this prison in the which wée
were committed, therefore I will acknowledge the great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

subiection and submission I owe vnto fortune, and giue her
thankes, that although in the one she hath bene vnto mee
contrarie, yet héerein hath she bene fauourable, in bringing
you hether into my presence in this great néede and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Therefore I will (if you be contented therewith) returne
with you vnto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for to conclude an entire and
euerlasting friendship with the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> your
Father, and to do that now by peace, which I could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conclude or finish by warres.</p>
               <p>Héere did the knight of the Sunne take great pleasure
and contentment, in that the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> would
returne into <hi>Grecia,</hi> for the which he offered to kisse his
hands: but yet the ioy and pleasure was much more, that
the faire Princesse <hi>Lyndabrides</hi> receiued, in that the iourney
should be such, that she might not so quicklie depart out of
the presence of the knight of the Sunne. And more it is to
be considered of them that in the like operations hath had
experience, for to giue iudgement of the imagination of those
two, when they sawe themselues together before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Alycandro,</hi> whereas they coulde not manifest anie
part of that which they thought within their hearts. At this
time approched vnto them <hi>Roboan</hi> and his sonnes, &amp; when
they vnderstoode who they were that were their prisoners,
and also the knight of the Sunne, they fell downe vppon
their knées at their féete for to kisse their handes, and craued
pardon of them for all that was past. Then the knight
of the Sunne sayd vnto the Emperour: My Lord, may it
please your Highnesse for to honour these knights, for that
they doe deserue it, for the great bountie and curtesie that
is in them. Then did the Emperour embrace them, &amp; caused
them to arise from the ground, &amp; offered himselfe to be their
friend euer after, &amp; for that he saw them sore hurt, he caused
them to be cured &amp; laid in their heds, whereas we wil leaue
them, to declare of other things that happened in this time, &amp;

               <head>What happened vnto Rosicleer after his departure out
of Constantinople. Chap. 41.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of the Chapter past, it was
told you, how <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was departed from
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> as well to séeke the knight
of the Sun his brother, that was departed
from the battaile past, as also for to méete
with <hi>Bramarant,</hi> for that he had great desire
for to combat with him, for that he séemed to be the most
strongest and mightiest Pagan that was to be found in all
the Paganisme. Now the Hystorie saith, that after he was
gone to sea in a little ship that he found in the port, the
passed storme and tempest did carrie them so farre, that they
were in sight of the strong Iland, and béeing discouered, the
Mariners did declare vnto him whose it was, and the euill
custome that was there maintained. Which when he heard
it did giue him a great good will for to goe thether, &amp; when
that he came nigh vnto, the Iland within a bow shoote, hée
sawe vpon the tops <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

cliffes, a damsell which made great hast in running awaie,
giuing great shrikes and cries, and following after her two
mightie, great, and deformed Gyants, with great desire to
ouertake her, the which when he sawe, with great good will
for to succour her, he caused the small ship to bee carried to
the shore, whereas this worthie knight leaped a land, and
began a foote to climbe vpon those rockes, with all the spéed
possible he could, not respec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ordained, with them whome hée went to séeke, but onelie
that wherevnto hée was bound by iustice and honour. And
when that hée was thus ariued, at the top of those rockes,
hee sawe come forth from amongest those cliffes the two
Gyanted, who brought betwixt them the Damsell that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee sow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, giuing great shrikes and lamentations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that shee was carried prisoner after that sorte.
<pb facs="tcp:13995:220"/>
These two Gyants were <hi>Rubero</hi> and <hi>Acorante,</hi> the two
younger sonnes vnto <hi>Roboan,</hi> who ariuing at the Ilande,
had seene the damsell vpon the top of the rockes, looking out
if she could discouer anie ship wherein she might haue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
her selfe. This damsell was the Quéene <hi>Iulia,</hi> and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
vnto the Princesse <hi>Lyndabrides,</hi> who for to deliuer her
selfe from the prison whether as they carried her mistres,
did fall into another daunger as ill, whereas all her wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and cunning could not deliuer her, although she dyd
deuine and prophesie of the same, who when the Gyants did
sée her, and that she séemed to be verie faire and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
(as of truth she was) they straight waies follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after her, and tooke her prisoner, and carrying her in that
sort as you haue heard, <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did put himself before them
and said.</p>
               <p>What is the occasion that you doe carrie this Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
prisoner in this sorte? Then the Gyants who had not
séene him before he spake vnto them, did verie much behold
him, and séeing him of so gallant a proportion and so well
armed, the elder of the twaine called <hi>Rubero</hi> went against
him, and said. Thou shalt be prisoner with her, and when
the time doth serue, thou shalt haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> answere of this thy
bolde demand, with the sacrifice that shall be done with both
of you. And as he would haue taken him in his armes, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi>
stroke him with his close fist such a blow vppon the
stomacke, that he all to buckled the plaies of stéele wherwith
he was armed, &amp; without breath ouerthrew him backwards
to the ground, whose fall was so great, that his brother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corante</hi>
thought verilie he had bene dead, who like a raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Lyon, giuing a great shrike, went against <hi>Rosicleer,</hi>
and with a great fauchon that he had, hée stroke so strong a
blowe vpon his shéeld, that hée cut it cleane asunder in the
middest, and the fauchon descended downe vpon his helme,
and hauing no power against the inchauntment thereof, it
made him to stoupe with his knées to the ground. Then
<hi>Rosicleer</hi> drew out his sworde, which was the same of so
great value, forged by the Quéene <hi>Iulia,</hi> who was present,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:13995:220"/>
wherewith he made him aunswere, in such sorte, that hée
cloue his shéeld asunder that he had on his left arme, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
his thicke and strong armour with the flesh, vnto the hard
bone. Then betwixt them two began a braue and stout
battaile, striking the one the other so great and furious
blowes, that they were heard throughout all the whole I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
in such sorte, that the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> and those
that were with him in the high Castle of <hi>Roboan</hi> were
greatlie amazed, and could not imagine what it should bée.
After this sort their combat endured betwixt them more
than a quarter of an houre, in the end whereof, the fine cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
sword of the Quéene <hi>Iulia,</hi> being flourished by the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
arme of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> brought the st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut <hi>Acorante</hi> into
that perplexitie, that he was all berayed in bloud with the
great number of wounds that was giuen him on all parts,
that if he had not bene so stout and couragious, &amp; of so great
force, he could not haue sustained himselfe vpon his féete, the
which was to the contrarie in <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> that although the
blowes of the Gyant were verie strong, and caused him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times to stoupe with his hands and knees to the ground,
and gaue him great paine and griefe whereas he dyd fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
anie blowe, yet for all that, his excellent armour dyd
assure him from wounds, and his great lightnesse did make
him to strike many of his blowes in vaine. Thus in the
meane time that <hi>Acorante</hi> was so feeble and saint with the
losse of bloud, and waxed wearie, <hi>Rubeo</hi> the other brother
was come vnto himselfe againe, and remembring what
had passed him, and seeing the greate perill whereinto his
brother was nowe brought, with a trice hée arose vp from
the ground, and taking his sworde in his hande hée began
to laie vppon <hi>Rosicleer</hi> such greate and mightie blowes,
(that by reason hee entered in a fresh, and the other béeing
samewhat wearie) hée put him into great extremitie, so that
all his valour and worthinesse was verie néedfull at that
instant.</p>
               <p>Then when the Quéene <hi>Iulia</hi> saw how that that knight
did all alone combat for her against the two Gyantes,
<pb facs="tcp:13995:221"/>
she straight waies called to remembrance that which many
daies before she had prophesied, and beholding the swoorde,
which the knight had, she knew it to bee the same which she
had forged with her owne hands, and then she thought all
her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>raua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le to be well bestowed, hauing great hope that
the knight should haue the victorie against those Gyantes,
for that she sawe him verie nimble and light, and that hée
wounded the Gyants in many places of their bodies, and
all the ground was beraied with the bloud that ranne out
of their wounds, but by reason that they were so boistrous
and so stout, they so doubled their blowes with so great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vpon <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> that it had bene sufficient to haue hewen
a rocke in péeces, so that in a short time they made him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
faint and wearie, brusing his flesh and bones, although
their swordes could not enter nor cut his inchanted armor.
And of truth, if that this battaile had endured long, hée had
béene brought into the greatest perill that euer he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in, in all his life, for that these two Gyants were young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and the most strongest that were to be found amongst
all Gyants. But yet at this instant <hi>Acorante</hi> was so weak
and féeble by the losse of much bloud, that he coulde not
stand on his féete, but fell downe to the ground as though he
had béene dead. Then he finding himselfe alone with <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bero,</hi>
the battaile was more indifferent, &amp; the one did charge
the other verie stronglie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> striking whereas they thought they
should doe most harme, each to his aduersarie, but <hi>Rubero</hi>
for the death of his brother was so full of wrath and ire, that
he made little account of the blowes that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did strike
him, although his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine cutting sworde had so sore wounded
him in many partes, that his death could not bée long dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by reason of the great quantitie of bloud that ranne out
of them.</p>
               <p>These Gyantes had certaine knightes which alwayes
went with them, who at this verie instant came vnto the
same place whereas they made their battaile, but yet in
anie manner of wise they durst not helpe their Lordes, for
that many times before they had plagued them, and giuen
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:13995:221"/>
them warning, that whensoeuer they were in battaile
with equall knightes, that none of them shoulde aide or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
them, for which occasion they stoode still, and were in
quiet, till such time as they sawe one of their Lordes lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
vpon the ground as though he had bene dead, and the
other so sore wounded, that he could not long indure, neither
could they anie longer refraine themselues, but all together
(who were more than fifteene) all wel armed, went against
<hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and began to charge him with verie thicke and
strong blowes, but <hi>Rubero</hi> when he sawe this did put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
before them, and cried out that they should departe and
let him alone, but they would not retire, but still pressed on
all that euer they coulde. Then he returned against them
with his sword, and did so much, that against their will hee
made them to retire. Then would he haue returned againe
vnto the battaile, but <hi>Rosicleer</hi> li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>God forbid that I should be ouercome at thy hands more
than at one time, for this which at this time thou hast vsed

to thy pleasure, vpon this condition, that you giue vnto this
Damsell free and whole libertie, who was the occasion of
this battaile which hath béen begun and continued betwixt
vs.</p>
               <p>You shall vnderstand, that all the sonnes of <hi>Roboan</hi> were
by nature well conditioned, and this <hi>Rubero</hi> the third sonne
was the best of them all, who acknowledging the greate
vantage that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> had of him (although all the knights
had h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

spoken proceeded of great vertue, hée then vnlaced his
healme and sayd.</p>
               <p>Let not my fortune permit, that against him who hath
so great vauntage on me, as well in vertue as in strength,
that I make anie more contention or farther <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, for
that in the ende both in the one and in the other, I cannot
choose but néedes must bée ouercome and loose the victorie.
<pb facs="tcp:13995:222"/>
This damsell is thine and thou hast wonne her, and nowe
looke what is thy pleasure to be done with vs, for that all
shall be accomplished as you wil command. Then <hi>Rosicleer</hi>
did embrace him with great loue, and both of them together
went to helpe vp <hi>Acorante,</hi> who was so féeble that he could
not moue himselfe, but when that they had pulled off his
healme, and giuen him aire, hée began to come better vnto
himselfe, and gather some strength. Then the Quéene <hi>Iulia</hi>
with a péece of a vaile which she had, bound vp his wounds
and stanched the bloud, by vertue of a stone which she had in
a ring, as one that in all things was a damsell verie wise,
and of great discretion. When all this was done, the Quéene
sayd vnto <hi>Rosicleer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Happie and fortunate knight, if you doe well remember
the condition wherewith you got this sword that you now
possesse, in great <hi>Britaine,</hi> it was, that you should combat
with two Gyants together for the deliuerie of a Damsell.
When <hi>Rosicleer</hi> heard these wordes, being greatlie amazed
how she should come to the knowledge thereof, he said: I
doe well remember the same. Well then (said she) now may
you well vnderstand and sée, how that the condition is well
accomplished, for that you haue had the battaile with these
two Gyants for to deliuer me that am the Quéene <hi>Iulia,</hi> she
who with her owne handes did forge the sword that you
now haue at your girdle, hauing experience before, how
much it should profit you in this battaile for my deliuerie.
Good Ladie (saide <hi>Rosicleer)</hi> what fortune hath brought so
wise and high a Damsell in this sorte into this Countrie?
That fortune (sayd the Quéene) that could ouerthrowe the
mightie <hi>Alycandro</hi> from the high throne wherevnto he was
exalted, and bring him to bée prisoner, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oyntlie with the
Princesse <hi>Lyndabrides</hi> his daughter, in the power of two
Gyants, who carryed them yesterdaie vnto the high Castle
that standeth vppon yonder mountaine. This is shée that
no force nor humane wisedome is able for to deliuer from
the subiection of her tumbling and tourning whéele.
And as I came with the Princesse, thinking for to escape
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:13995:222"/>
from the prison (whether as they carryed her) I ran away
secretly and put my selfe amongst these Rocks, but yet in
the ende I chaunced to fall into a daunger no lesse perillous
then that, out of the which I thought to haue escaped. At
which words <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was greatly amazed and saide, is it
possible to be true, that the Emperour <hi>Alicandro</hi> and the
Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> are prisoners. It is of trueth sayde
the Quéene, for that two Gyants did carrie them vnto yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
castell. Well then let vs goe thether out of hand, sayd
<hi>Rosicleer,</hi> for with a verie good will I will aduenture my
life for to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>et at libertie, so high personages. It shall not be
nedefull said <hi>Rubero,</hi> for that those two who did carrie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
be our bretheren, and sonnes vnto <hi>Roboan</hi> our Father,
therefore let vs go straight waies thether, for by your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
they and all those that be prisoners in the castell
shal be set at libertie. <hi>Rosicleer</hi> receiued great contentment
at that which <hi>Rubero</hi> had sayde, and gratifying him, they
all together went towards the castell, and their knights did
carrie <hi>Acorante</hi> in their armes, for that he was very sore
wounded. And it fell out in this sort, that as those that were
in the castell did heare the great noyse that was made in
the battaile, with clittering of their armour <hi>Roboan</hi> and
his sonnes were in their beddes very sore hurt, and could
not aryse, but the knight of the Sunne being very desirous
to know what it should bée, for that it séemed vnto him, to
be some contension or cumbat fought by valiant and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
knights, he went foorth of the castell, and all alone on
horsebacke he rode that way, whereas <hi>Rosicleer</hi> and the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
should come. And when that he saw them comming a
farre of, he straight waies vnderstoode that they should be
the sonnes of <hi>Roboan,</hi> that came from the Sea, &amp; brought
with them some prise, but when that he came nigher vnto
them, he was greatly amazed to sée those Gyants so sore
wounded, &amp; could not immagine who should doe the same,
till such time as he asked of one that came formost, with
whome they had had battaile, but they were all so sad and
sorowfull, that they would not aunswere him any word,
<pb facs="tcp:13995:223"/>
but passed forwardes on without making anie reckoning of
him, for the which the knight of the Sunne being somwhat

hée should not depart thence till such time as he had tolde

without speaking anie worde drew out his sword, and

helme, thinking therewith to haue parted his head in two
péeces, but it had ben much better for him not to haue begun
that contention with him whome he did not know, and to
haue answered him to his demand, it would haue hindered
him nothing at all. But the knight of the Sunne being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
angrie at his great villanie, stroke him such a blowe
with his armed fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his healme to his scull, that his braines flew out, and he fell
from his horse dead vnto the ground, so that it cost him his
life, because hée woulde not speake, but vse villanie. And
the rest which were of his companie when they sawe their
companion thus ouerthrowen, straight waies beganne to
make contention with the knight of the Sunne, in drawing
out their swordes, and charging him with their blowes on
euerie side, but before that they could fall in the reckoning of
the great errour the which they had committed, the most
part of them were slaine and ouerthrowen to the ground,
and not one of them had remained aliue, if that at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
had not come <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> who was behinde all the rest,
who when hée sawe the great slaughter that the Knight of
the Sunne had done in so short a time, hée was greatlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed,
and for that hée could not knowe who hée was, and
was verie desirous to proue himselfe with him, for to bée
reuenged for the death of those knightes, he caused the other
for to aparte themselues, and with his sworde in his hande
he assaulted him, charging him with those strong and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
blowes which he was wont to vse, and the knight of the
Sunne not knowing him, but beleeuing within himselfe
that he had bene one of the companie of the other knightes
of the Gyantes, dyd receiue him after such manner,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:13995:223"/>
that in a short space the wrath and anger both of the one &amp;
the other was greatly increased, &amp; as mortall enimies they
layde the one vpon the other, making so great a noyse, that
it séemed al y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whole Iland would haue sunke, where at the
Emperour <hi>Alicandro</hi> and the princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> did put

knight of the Sunne: a good halfe houre in this sorte they
endured, charging one the other with their thicke blowes,
and had no time to breath themselues, and séemed to be all

at the great force and strength of his aduersarie, as
they who neuer had seene themselues in so terrible and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

in the great court of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> at that time they had
not their force and strength so perfect, neither were they so

               <p>And now if it were not for that neither of them would

but this point of honour was the occasion that they

would not strike him, till such time as he was come againe
vnto himselfe. <hi>Rosicleer</hi> called vpon God for his aide &amp; suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
as he who found himselfe in so great extremitie, that
he thought it vnpossible to escape from death, if he should
receiue such an other blow, equal vnto that he had receiued.
He then setled himselfe againe in his saddle, and prepared
himselfe, to be reuenged on his aduersarie, and dyd abyde
his comming with his sword in his hande, with terrible &amp;
furious semblaunt. In the meane time whilest they were
recouering of more furie and courage for to charge the one
the other, it so fell out that the Quéene <hi>Iulia</hi> being very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to know who those knights should be, that semed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her to be the most biggest of proporcion and most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antest
that euer she had séene in all her lyfe, tooke out a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
quadrangel, (the which continually she carried in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
wherewith she did vse to make her cuniurations) and
thereby she found that these knights should be both sonnes
vnto the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and being certified hereof,
with a trice she went vnto them, and at such time as with
furious courage they began to strike the one the other, she
put her selfe betwixt them saying: I doe most heartelie
request you sir knights, that you would staye your furie a
little, and to graunt vnto mée a bowne the which I will
craue at your hands, for as it will be vnto me great ioye and
pleasure, so will it be vnto you profitable.</p>
               <p>Then they who were indewed with no lesse vertue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
force and valour, withdrew themselues a part, and sayde,
that either of them for their parts, did graunt her request.
Well then sayd the Queen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you doe retourne any more vnto the combat, that either of
you doe pul of your healme, for that I am desirous to know
who you are before you proceede any further. She had not
so sone spoken these words, but these knights without any
longer tarrying did vnlace their healmes, and pulled them
of, being greatly amazed at that bowne, which she demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
But when their healmes were off, and they knew them
selues to be bretheren, it could not be immagined the great
and vnlooked for ioye and pleasure that they receiued. For
in place of their mortall blowes which they had giuen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they embrased the one the other, as they which did loue
the one the other excéedingly. And giuing great thanks vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Quéene for that which she had done, they declared
the one vnto the other the whole discourse what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
vnto either of them.</p>
               <p>Then the knight of the Sunne spake vnto the two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren
<hi>Rubero</hi> and <hi>Acorante,</hi> and tolde them of all that had
happened, who were not a little amazed, to heare how that
their Father and bretheren were ouercome by that alone
knight, and as a thing impossible they would not beléeue it:
then they went all together vnto the castell, whereas they
were well receiued by the Emperour <hi>Alicandro,</hi> and the
Princesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> when they knew that that was <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer,</hi>

satisfie their eyes in beholding of them, séeming that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
did very much straine her selfe in the forming of these
two bretheren. After a while that they hadde passed away
the time in treating of many things, they sat downe and
dyd ease themselues, and determined to stay there till the
next day, whereas they were very well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

beléeue, that the faire princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> did not thinke
long this nauigatorie, although it had bene more longer
then that of the Gréeke <hi>Vlisses:</hi> for that she dyd there whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recreate her selfe in the sight and swéete conuersation of
the knight of tho Sunne. Yet for all that she feared verie
much (at the comming to <hi>Constantinople)</hi> the presence of
the princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> with the which she should be clean
wipte out of the heart of her knight. So nauigating in this
sort, the next day in the morning, two houres before daye,
it chaunced that by their ship there passed an other ship hard
aboard, in the which was certaine knights, &amp; one of them,
who séemed to be of a very bigge stature and members, and
being aboue hatches, and the shippes ioyning very nigh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
commaunded to cast out his grapple into the other
ship, because we should not depart till such time as they had
demaunded what it should be, and who was there within.
Then he asked of a knight that was the Emperour <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candros,</hi>
if that he could tell him anie newes of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Alicandro,</hi> and of his daughter the faire princesse <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabrides,</hi>
or of any damsel of hers. Ah sir, yes said the knight,
for they are in this shippe, &amp; certaine Gréeke knights doth
carrie them vnto <hi>Grecia.</hi> At which words this bigge knight
and an other, made no longer tarrying, but leapt into their
ship with their swords drawen in their handes, &amp; straight

who when they vnderstood of the grapling of their shippes,
lased on their helmes, and went forth to see what it shoulde

made to enter, with their swordes in their handes, they

haue, nor carrie with you, sayd the knight of the Sunne, for
that we haue it in great price and estimation. In this sort
it shall be full déere vnto you, aunswered one of the other
knights, and straight waies without anie more speaking,
they began to strike at the two brethren, each of them a blow
vpon their helmes, that caused either of them for to sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with their knées to the ground, and made them verie well to
vnderstand that they were knightes of estimation and
prowesse, but yet thinges did not fall out on their parte as
they thought, for that they, as those that in all the whole
world were without comparison, gaue them their answere
in such sorte, that they were forced to step backwardes thrée
paces, to sustaine themselues from falling, and were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfullie
amazed at the great force and strength of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,
so that then betwixt them beganne the battaile
to bée well fought with charging each other with mightie
blowes, that it was a verie straunge thing to beholde, and
with the noise of their mightie and timerous blowes, it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that those long and wide seas did sound of them, much
lyke vnto the forced waues, being driuen by tempest into
the hollow caues of the rockes. And by reason that it was
before the breake of the daie (béeing at such time as there is
silence with all thinges) the mightie noise of their terrible
blowes seemed more great and timerous. Neither at that
time had they neede of anie Torches, or of the cléernesse
of <hi>Diana</hi> for to make their combat, for that the innumerable
sparkes of fire the which flew out of their fine armour,
gaue such excéeding great light and cleerenesse, that if there
had beene ten knights, they might haue séene to haue fought

his brother could make so great resistance. Thus after one
whole houre that the battaile was begunne, those two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the sonnes of <hi>Trebatio</hi> were halfe ashamed that their
aduersaries should so long endure before them, which caused
them to waxe verie furious and wrathfull, and to redouble
their blowes in such sorte, that I beléeue there was no
strength nor finenesse of Diamond that was able to resist
their terrible blowes, and their aduersaries féeling the force
of them were greatlie amazed, and it séemed that their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
and strength was increased halfe so much more as it
was at the beginning of the battaile, for that they neuer
stroke blowe, if it chaunced aright, but it made them to

and gaue them no spate for to breath themselues, so that they
were put in the most greatest trauaile that euer they were
in all their liues, but yet these knightes were such, that first
they would consent to bée hewed and cut all to péeces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they woulde yéeld, and if their aduersaries had not bene
the myrrour of all the world, they shoulde haue had inough
to doe to haue escaped out of their hands, and although they
séemed to bée wearie, yet was it in such sorte, that they
could not iudge or discerne anie point of weaknesse in them,
but rather made heartes of their guts, and so charged their
aduersaries, that many times they were in doubt of the
victorie, and it had ben a battaile verie long and well fough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
but that at this instant the daie dyd breake, and as the
cléerenesse came on, the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<hi>Lyndabrides</hi> and <hi>Floralindia</hi> did knowe those two

hoped to make friendship, in such sorte, that he might haue
her to wife, which was the thing that the Princesse most
desired. After this sort they did nauigate by sea foure dayes

great loue, as though they had béene alwaies before

varietie of coulours which went and came, at such time as
shée remembred how that the Princesse <hi>Claridiana</hi> shoulde
receiue her in the Pallace of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and
also of that which the knight of the Sunne would conceiue
in his heart when he sawe the same, the which thoughts did
make her to go in so great confusion, as to your iudgement
I doe referre it, her loue was so great the which she bare
vnto him, that shée could not bée without great iuspition of
alteration, when that she considered of the great worthinesse
and desert of the Princesse <hi>Claridiana.</hi> So that the whole
<pb facs="tcp:13995:229"/>
world was nothing in comparison, that she would giue, on
condition that the knight of the Sunne might neuer sée the
Princesse. If she were sure thereof, then were she fullie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefied
that the knight of the Sunne would not chaunge her
for anie other Ladie or damsel in all the whole world. When
they were entered into the Citie, and came vnto the pallace,
those worthie Princes and knightes did descend from their
horses those faire Ladies and damsels, and being mounted
into the great hall, the Empresse <hi>Briana</hi> with the Princesse
<hi>Claridiana,</hi> and the Princesse <hi>Oliuia</hi> and <hi>Lindaraza,</hi> with al
the rest of those high and worthie Ladies &amp; Gentlewomen
that were with them, came forth and did receiue them with
that honor that was requisite vnto so high and mightie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages.

<hi>Brandimardo,</hi> meruailed greatlie to sée the soueraigne beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
that was there assembled together, which seemed vnto
them, as it was true, that in all the whole worlde could not
the like be séene, but when the faire Princesse <hi>Lyndabrides</hi>
went to embrace the roiall Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> Good Lord
how her hart was troubled, to see in her rubicond face, al the

                  </gap>o how that
her knight of the Sunne had his eies fixed on her. At that
instant shee thought verilie her soule would haue departed
from her bodie, &amp; almost she could not go forwards, neither
scarce speake a word she was in such a trance. The which
was all contrarie in the Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> for as shee
was sure of the loue of the knight of the Sunne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which time, for her sake, he did many valiant deedes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:13995:232"/>
to be put in memorie. Likewise the faire <hi>Polisena</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no lesse ouercome &amp; vanquished with his loue, did not
loue him with any other entension but to marrie with him,
thinking that with no other knight she might better match
her selfe then with him, so that these two, were verie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
together in their wills and desires, as I who was
a third person betwixt them, do know and am a witnesse to
the same, and also doe iustifie, that betwixt a knight and a
ladie, there was neuer so perfect loue, as was betwixt these
two, or that more intirely dyd loue the one the other. And
yet not being satisfied nor well content with this, but the
more to be in securitie the one of the other, I was as a
meane betwixt them, that this <hi>Lusiano</hi> should come on a
night appointed vnto a window that had a grate of Iron,
out of the chamber of the saide dutches, whereas he should
finde her, &amp; there the one vnto the other to assure the bands
of Matrimonie by word and promise betwixt them, in such
sort, that from that day forwards they might liue in more
securitie. It fell out that all was done as it was agréed, that
this gentle <hi>Lusiano</hi> in a darke night came vnto the windo
whereas he found his faire <hi>Polisena,</hi> and betwixt them was
concluded the bandes of Matrimonie by word of mouth, in
my presence, and in the presence of an other damsell of the
Dutches, (who I doe beléeue is not cléere of this treason
that I will tell you.) This being done, the dutches for that
she would not that they should be discouered or spyed, dyd
desire the gentle <hi>Lusiano</hi> that he would straight waies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
and she likewise did withdraw her selfe and caused the
window to be shoot: and being verie feareful that it should
be discouered vnto the Quéene, she neuer after durst speake
vnto her knight, neither be with him in companie in any
suspicious place, as one that was fully persuaded of the loue
to be perfect that was betweene them, in this sort all things
dyd prosper verie well betweene these two louers, but yet
their loue was not so perfect, as their fortune was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
to apart them from the ioye and glorie that they hoped
to be betwixt them. For that (Sir knights) you shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
<pb facs="tcp:13995:233"/>
that little more then halfe a yéere past, there came
vnto the court of the king <hi>Tiberio,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxonia</hi>
called <hi>Roberto</hi> the mightie, for that he was so bigge of his
bodie, that he lacked but a little to be as bigge as a gyant,
and of so great force &amp; strength, that there was not a knight
to be found, that man for man durst enter with him in
battaile, but alonely this gentle <hi>Lusiano,</hi> who feared not the
bignesse of his bodie, neither his great fame. At such time
as this Duke <hi>Roberto</hi> came vnto the court, the king gaue
him good entertainment, and dyd him great honour, as well
for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he was of high estate, as for the great fame the which
he had. This Duke so soone as he had séene the faire <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sena,</hi>
was so farre in loue with her, that straight waies he
thought to haue her vnto wife, which was the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
straight waies he laboured all that euer he could to bring
his determination to effect. But she that nothing dyd more
abhorre and hate, (as well for the loue which shée bare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Lusiano)</hi> as for the boysterous and brauenesse of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for that he had a fearce face, and terrible countenance,
by no meanes she could not abyde him, but dyd refuse his
offer, and many times she sayde vnto him in my presence,
that he should not come any more before her, for that his
presence should be greuous vnto her, yet for all that would
he not giue ouer his sute, but still dyd contende to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
her, in such sort, that she was determined for to giue
the King to vnderstande thereof, if that I had not persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               <p>Then the Duke <hi>Roberto,</hi> seing that nothing whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

time of their tender age. Then Duke <hi>Roberto</hi> hauing these
knights on his part, watched his time, and went before the
king at such time as the Quéene was present, and made a
great complaint vnto them saying, that of long time he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with true and perfect loue, the Dutches of <hi>Austria,</hi> and
how that by the good will and consent of them both, they
were made sure together, so that he was her husband and
she his wife. But now since the conclusion of this matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
the Dutches doth denye it againe, and hath sworne

should be thus angrie with him, to denie that which she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Lord, to doe him Iustice therein, and to commaund

iustice as much as in his strength, presupposed the victorie
to be on his part, but alasse Fortune hath fallen out cleane

that the other foure knightes were commended to bée so

for that they thought of a truth, that the Duke <hi>Roberto</hi> had

as the Duke <hi>Roberto</hi> had lost all his hope for to haue

himselfe to vse some other meanes, which was the worst
that euer was procured or done by anie knight, for when hée

practised with her, that she should apparell her selfe with the

as you doe verie well knowe, but now by the good successe
that alwayes I hoped for of this my Matrimonie, it hath
pleased God, that the Dutchesse hath now conserted with
mée, that this next night that commeth, she will come forth
into a garden that is on the backe side of her lodging, where
as she willeth me to méete her, and there she wil accomplish
all that I haue desired, and for that I doe know and haue

that the Moone did shine so bright, yea nigh hand shée did
seeme to bée the Dutchesse, for that shee was faire, and of
her owne stature, and was apparelled with a gowne of
gréene veluet, set full of brouches of golde, wherein was set
many fine presious stones, shée also had her haire hanging
about her shoulders, which reached downe to the ground,
and vpon her head a garland set full of Diamonds and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies
of great price, with the which garment and garland the
thrée knightes dyd sée the Dutchesse the daie before, in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
bankets and feasts that were made, and by reason that
it was night, although the Moone did shine verie cléere,
yet because shee was somewhat a farre of, they coulde not
discerne anie other but that she was the Dutchesse. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
shee had in her hand a bunch of feathers, wherewith

towards a fresh fountaine there at hand, compassed rounde
about with Iasmires and Muske Roses. And before that
they could come thether, the Damsell sayde. My Lord, you
doe well know, that I doe not come hether for any other
thing, but to plight vnto you my faith and troth, to be your
wyfe, and you my husband and spouse, and that to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
I would not come for all the world into this place, so
much against my honour. My desire is, that this should bée
done out of hand, and that we might depart, for that I feare
to be discouered. My good Ladie &amp; Dutches (sayd the Duke)
this is that the which I so long haue looked and hoped for.
And now séeing that we are both agréed, and conformable
in our good wills, now I doe saye that I doe receiue my
Ladie the Dutches <hi>Polisena,</hi> for my welbeloued spouse and
wife, and that I doe renounce all other and cleaue my selfe
onely vnto her, so long as we shall liue.</p>
               <p>Well then my good Lord, sayd the Damsell: Héere your

Duke of <hi>Saxonia,</hi> for her spouse, and will that no other shal
be her husband, but you alone.</p>
               <p>All this that passed betwixt them, was very well heard
by the thrée knightes that were in secret: and surely they
were out of all doubt to the contrarie, but that should be
the Dutches of <hi>Austria.</hi> For if they had knowen otherwise,
or had any other thing in their thoughts, they were such
knights, that they would not haue affirmed that which they
had sayd for all the kingedome of <hi>Hungaria.</hi>

               <p>When that this communicacion of matrimonie was

might be heard by the thrée knights, although they could
not sée any thing, by reason of the thicknesse of the trées
whereas they were, there the Duke did accomplish his wil
with the Damsell. And when it was houre and time for
to withdraw themselues, they went hand in hand together
vnto the posterne where she came forth, and there the duke
with many imbracings and kissings, did take his leaue of
her, and she entred in, and went to sléepe, leauing the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raile

and was not séene by any: And the Duke retourned vnto
the thrée knights, and departed from thence.</p>
               <p>It fell out within a while after happened all that this

dyd loue the Dutches so entirely, and was so fully certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

him into a great alteration of minde, and almost from him
selfe, to sée the witnesse that was brought against the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
by those thrée knights, whome he had in estimation to
be loyall, faithfull, and of great credit: and beleeued verely
that they would not but tell the trueth, in that behalfe, if
that to either of them should be giuen a whole kingdome.
And to the contrarie, he had so great a confidence in his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and mistresse, that he was fully determined first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him from the death, for that euerie one of the foure,
were so strong and valiant knights, that in all <hi>Hungaria</hi>
was not to be found one that could match any of them.

her selfe verie close, till such time as the
Duke and his companions came foorth all
foure together, and armed with rich and glittering armor,
mounted vpon a great and gallant horse, &amp; had with them
so gallant semblance, that they semed to be knights of great
valour &amp; worthinesse, as well in their armour, as in their
gallant proporcion. In this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

armour, garnished about with golde and rich stoones, which
was conformable vnto his estate, and was mounted vpon
a mightie horse trapped with blewe veluet and bordered
with gold, and was in all things of so gallant and gentle
disposition, that ther was not one in all the place, but when
they saw him, did receue great sorrow and griefe, in such
sorte, that there was amongst them a great sound in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a lamentation, for that they made rekoning that he
was a dead man, and there were fewe amongst them but

that the gentle <hi>Lusiano</hi> might cleere himselfe of that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise,

                  <hi>Roberto</hi> had reason on his side, and again (as it was likely)
they thought it impossible that he should escape from that
battaile with his life. Then the king commaunded that the
Dutches should be brought foorth for to see and behold the
battaile that was ordained for her sake, who very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her will, was brought vnto a window of the pallas:
but when she saw her gentle spouse, her heart was all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
with sorrow and griefe, and as dead she fell down to
the ground, whereas her life had bene in great perill, if that
within a short space she had not bene comforted with the
comming of the two knights.</p>
               <p>So soone as the damsell saw that it was houre &amp; time,
with a trice she went vnto the In whereas she had left <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleere</hi>

of that which had passed, and how that they were readie to
goe to battaile. They straight waies mounted vpon their
horses, and with all the spéede possible, came vnto the place,
at such time as the Iudges did part the Sunne and the field
vnto the knight, readie to leaue them to their battaile. And
as they pressed to enter into the place, all the people dyd
make them large and broade way, for to passe, as well to
cleere themselues from the furie of their great hast, as also
for that they sawe them to be armed with so precious and

<hi>Lusiano,</hi> by my good fortune I met with these two knights,
who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they vnderstood by mée, the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my sorow

<pb facs="tcp:13995:240"/>
by reason and Iustice, are come hether with mée, and will
defend the cause on the part and behalfe of my Ladie the
Dutches. Therefore on their parts I am come vnto your
highnesse, to request you to graunt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> licence for the same,
for so much as they be strangers, and would not erre in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that is dewtifull vnto your seruice.</p>
               <p>The king, who all this time dyd verie well behold the
two knights, and lyked them meruailously well, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
glad and ioyefull at the words of the Damsell, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
some hope (more then before) of the deliuerie of the
Prince, by the ayde of those two knights, aunswered and
sayde, that the Duke and his companions were foure, so
that <hi>Lusiano</hi> might likewise take vnto him other thrée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and that there was no reason in him for to denie
them, therefore the knights might doe what their pleasure
was, and that he should be well content therewith.</p>
               <p>The Duke and his companions when that they sawe
how that <hi>Lusiano</hi> had companions, made no rekoning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off,
for that if they were tenne of them, they hoped before
an houre were ended, they would bring them vnto their
endes. But the Prince when that he sawe himselfe in the
middest betwixt two such knights, receiued no small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
for that they séemed to be of high estate &amp; great
renowme, as well in their rich armour, as of their gallant
and stoute proporcions. But in especiall <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> for that
there was not a knight in all that place, but he had foure
fingers vauntage of him in height, so that it séemed vnto
him that in all his life he had not séene a knight of a gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
disposition. And hauing no time for to speak vnto them,
he bowed downe his head, in token of humilitie, giuing
them thankes for the great courtesie which they shewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
               <p>At this time the houre was come, and the trumpets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to sownde, making a great noyse, whereat the Duke &amp;
his companions, with their speares in their hands, set spurs
vnto their horses, running with al furie possible. The other

made battaile together with their swords, <hi>Liriaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>
made his encounter with <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who was a gallant
knight. And now whether it was for that he was in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his parents, or by his great bountie and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<hi>Liriamandro</hi> ouerthrew the stout <hi>Ricardo,</hi> horse and
man to the ground. And although by the force thereof he
lost his stirrups, yet lyke a good knight he passed forwards
and kept his saddle: and for that he séemed to haue the
vauntage on his aduersarie, he dyd alight from his hose, &amp;
made his battaile on foote. Then against <hi>Rosicleer</hi> (for that
he seemed to be the biggest and most valiantest of them all)
he was encountred by the two most valiantest and stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

were of so great force and strength, that so lightly had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen
their aduersaries, and from that time forwardes
<pb facs="tcp:13995:241"/>
had a better hope of the victorie. Then the Dutches who
was as one halfe dead, being comforted with those newes,
with a better good will then before, put her selfe at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
for to behold the battaile.</p>
               <p>Then the worthie <hi>Rosilceere</hi> finishing the furie of his
swift course, with great lightnesse, he tourned his horse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
&amp; retourned vpon <hi>Ambardo,</hi> who remained on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
and stroke at him such a blow with his sword, that
the shylde he lift vp for to ward the furie thereof (although
it was of fine and hard stéele) hée cloue it in two péeces, and
from thence descended vpon his helme with so great furie,
that it made him to stoope with his head, declyning it to his
horse necke. And this stout <hi>Ambardo,</hi> when that he felt him
selfe ouercharged with that mightie blow, being greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed,
he said within himselfe, what is this, mée thinketh I
féele all the furie of the world against mée, is this by fortune
the sonne of <hi>Trebatio,</hi> that passed this way when he slewe
<hi>Aridon,</hi> or else is that strong <hi>Achilles,</hi> sonne vnto <hi>Peleo,</hi>
risen againe from death to life, or that first begotten of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus:</hi>
for according as I doe féele the great force of this
knight, it is not possible, but he must néedes be one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And in saying these wordes, for that he was a valiant and
couragious knight, with all the furie of his armes he stroke
such a blow at <hi>Rosicleere</hi> vpon the head, that he gaue him
well to vnderstand that he was a verie valiant and chosen
knight.</p>
               <p>All this time <hi>Liriamandro</hi> and <hi>Ricardo</hi> combatted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
in such sort, that the battaile was worth the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
they were both stout and valiant knights, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the one the other with so great power &amp; strength, that
it made them all to meruaile. But he that was most oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and had greatest trauaile in this battaile was the prince
<hi>Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iano,</hi> for that being in battaile with the Duke, came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
against him the stout <hi>Carmelio,</hi> and although he was of
great bountie, yet had he enough to doe for to cleere himselfe
from either of them: and he had passed great euell betwixt
them two, if that at this instant had not chaunsed that the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:13995:241"/>
worthie <hi>Rosicleer</hi> being in battaile with <hi>Anibardo,</hi> séeing
himselfe before his graundfather, his courage so increased
in him, that with the furie of all his force, he stroke so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
strong and furious a blow vpon his helme, that he had
clouen him downe vnto the wast, if that his helme had not
bene the finer, and forged by art magicke, which was the
occasion that his fine cutting sworde could not enter nor
cut it, but yet by the great force of the valiant <hi>Anibardo,</hi>
cleane from himselfe fell from his horse to the ground, not
without great wondering vnto all them that saw that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and furious blow: and looking on the one side, he saw
the Prince <hi>Lusiano,</hi> how he was in fight against both the
other knights, who then with a trice leaped from his horse,
and went and put himselfe before the Duke, and stroke his
first blow at him in such sorte, that he made him to stoope
with both his hands to the ground. Then the Duke, who
was of a valiant and stout courage, let <hi>Lusiano</hi> in battaile
with <hi>Carmelio,</hi> and began to charge <hi>Rosicleer</hi> with such
mightie and strong blowes, that he made him to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that he was a valiant and worthie knight. And it
gréeued <hi>Rosicleer</hi> verie much to thincke that in the Duke
should remaine so great treaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he being a knight of so great
bountie and valour in armes. And being verie desirous that
the truth thereof might be knowne, he forced himselfe all
that euer he could, for to ouercome the Duke, who for a
while did defend himselfe very valiantly, being greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
at the strange bountie and force of his aduersarie,
and could not immagine who it should be, except he were
sent from heauen for to punish the great treason which hée
had done against the Dutches, as one worthie thereoff. All
this time the prince <hi>Liriamandro</hi> séeing himselfe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his father and mother, and desirous to get honour
before them, dyd so ouercharge his aduersarie, that in a smal
time he abated the courage of <hi>Ricardo,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the vauntage was
on <hi>Liriamandros</hi> part. Likewise y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gentle <hi>Lusiano</hi> &amp; the stout
<hi>Carmelio</hi> who were almost equall in bountie, with great
force charged the one y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> other with such blowes, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they semed
<pb facs="tcp:13995:242"/>
to be all on fire, with the great quantitie of sparkes that
flew out of their armour, and although for a good while
there was knowen no aduauntage betwixt them, yet in the
end the couragious force of the Prince endured longest, and
he did so intreate his aduersarie, that he would haue giuen
a great part of his estate, so that he might haue béene cléered
of that battaile with honour. The which grieued nothing
at all the faire <hi>Polisena,</hi> who séeing her knight so stout and

with shedding of many teares praie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

she was brought out of that care, for that the inclite and

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> charged
him so fast with his terrible and furious blowes, that hée
made him all astonied and amazed, that he knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he went, nor where he stroke his blowes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>éeing him
in that perplexitie, with his right hand hée tooke him fast by
the goriet, and pulled him with so greate strength, that hée
ouerthrew him at his féete, and before he could arise again,
he put his knée vpon his breast, and pulled his healme from
his head, and put his swoorde vnto his throate, and sayde
thus.</p>
               <p>Duke, thou art but dead, if thou doest not confesse the
truth of this treason which thou hast raised against the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse
of <hi>Austria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Duke séeing himselfe in that extremitie,
thought of truth that the diuine iustice was come vppon
him, and that he was some Angell sent from God for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroie
and kill him, and fearing least both bodie and soule
should bée destroyed, he determined to tell the truth of all
the whole treason, so that he sayde vnto <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> that hée
should holde his hands and not kill him, not for that he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to die, but to saue his soule, he would tell him the truth
thereof.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did assure him his life, and gaue him his
hand, and dyd helpe him to arise from the ground, and when
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:13995:242"/>
he sawe the other knights in battaile, he and <hi>Rosicleer</hi> went
and did part them, and put themselues betwéene them, and
sayd.</p>
               <p>Sir knights, let this your contentious battaile cease, for
there is no reason wherfore you should receiue anie harme,
but I alone who is in the fault and worthie to be blamed.
At which words saying, <hi>Liriamandro</hi> had ouerthrowen the
stout <hi>Ricardo,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lusiano</hi> had brought <hi>Carmelio</hi> into a great
perplexitie, so that they had not much a doe to part them, the
which being done, the Duke with an high voice, that the
king and all that were there about him might heare, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all the whole treason, how and in what sort, in all points
as he dyd it, and as you haue heard. But when the gentle
<hi>Lusiano</hi> sawe the honour of his spouse so cleere, and the great
fortune and victorie that he had in the battaile, whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both the honour of his Ladie and his lyfe was cleane
lost, it cannot bée expressed the great ioy and plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure that
entered into his heart, and how thankfullie he gratified <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi>
and <hi>Liriamandro,</hi> desiring them to shew him so much
pleasure as to tell him who they were, &amp; to take of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
all that was their pleasure and wills, for that was too
little for them, in consideration of the great pleasure that
they dyd for him. But the ioy and contentment which the
faire <hi>Polisena</hi> receiued, no man is able to expresse. Likewise
the King and the Queene were verie ioyfull, for they loued
meruailous well the Prince <hi>Lusiano</hi> and the Dutchesse,
and meruailing verie much at the straunge bountie of the
kni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tes, they thought it long till they knew what they
were, for that they vnderstood they were not of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.
The king then commaunded that they shoulde come
before him, who straight wayes with <hi>Lusiano</hi> went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the king, and when that they had done their dutie, and
before that they pulled off their healmes, or treated of anie
other matter, they craued of the king that both the Duke
and the Damsell might bee pardoned, and although the king
determined to punish them as they had deserued, yet in
the ende at their request hee dyd pardon them, with this
<pb facs="tcp:13995:243"/>
condition, that the Duke with the Damsell should out of
hand depart the Court, and neuer more in all their liues to
enter into the same. The Duke straight waies gaue great
thankes vnto the knightes for that which for him they had
done, &amp; the same daie after that they knew who the knights
were, he departed from the Court with his damsell, and the
reward which he gaue vnto her for her labour, was, that the
same night he slew her in a Forrest, being ashamed of that
which with her he had done. And this is the reward that
all such ought to looke for, for although there be many that
would profit themselues of the treason, yet in conclusion (by
great fortune) there are few traitors that doe escape their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
&amp; surelie they ought not to be suffered amongst men,
for that there is no perill or daunger that may be compared
vnto the mischieuous practise and pretence of a traitor no
not the raging waues of the sea, earthquakes, whirle winds,
thunder boltes, stormes, warres, no nor the furie of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for the proofe whereof I doe referre mée vnto the
mightie <hi>Alexander,</hi> whose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lying in the aire, and trauailing
on the seas, whose conquests of the whole world, with wars
and battailes, none of all these were sufficient for to bring
him vnto his end, but onelie a traitor, one of his owne reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
by treason did kill him. If this example be not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
consider of <hi>Darius</hi> that was before him, and of <hi>Priamus</hi>
the mightie, <hi>Achilles, Minos, Nisus, Agamemnon, Romulus,

                  </gap>, the mightie
<hi>Bompeus, Iulius Caesar,</hi> and many other Emperours and
kings, vnto whom no perill was so dangerous, as treason,
ordained and wrought by their owne seruants, so that with
great reason the traitor ought to be abhorred, as wel as they
that doe inioy the benefite of treason rewarded, as well the
Damsell as the Duke <hi>Roberto,</hi> who thought she went for
to bée rewarded for her trauaile, yet she receiued the iust pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for her fault.</p>
               <p>But now to returne vnto that which did remaine, the
Hystorie saith, that after the king had pardoned and forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the Duke, he had great desire for to knowe whome the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:13995:243"/>
knights were. Then <hi>Rosicleer</hi> and <hi>Liriamandro</hi> pulled off
their helmes, and knéeling downe before the king, <hi>Liriaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>
sayd: Let your Highnesse know and be acquainted with
this knight, who is <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> sonne vnto the Emperor <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio,</hi>
and of the Empresse <hi>Briana,</hi> whom al the whole world
for his great bountie ought to honor, &amp; me for <hi>Liriamandro</hi>
your sonne, and of the Quéene <hi>Augusta</hi> my Lady &amp; mother,
who with newes of great ioy and pleasure doe come to kisse
your handes. When the king knew to be in his presence
his so long desired sonne, and the other to be <hi>Rosicleer</hi> his
nephew, it cannot be expressed the great ioy, contentment, &amp;
pleasure he receiued at his heart, as he that in all the world
desired no other thing, and as one from himselfe with great
ioy he went &amp; embraced them, saying: Oh my sonnes, what
ioyfull and happie newes is this vnto me, for that in it is
accomplished the thing that I most desired before I should
die, how is it that you haue consented so long time to kéepe
from me this great ioy? The king had scarce concluded these
wordes, when that the Queene with incredible ioy &amp; great
hast came vnto them, &amp; threw her armes about their necks,
whereas she remained embracing of them both a greate
while, and could not speake one word for ioy. Thus after
there had passed betwixt them many wordes of great ioy in
this their ioyfull meeting, straight waies the Prince <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siano</hi>
came and kneeled downe before them, and would haue
kissed their hands, as well for the great curtesie which they
had done for him, as also for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>Liriamandro</hi> was his Prince

Then after him came vnto them the three valiant knights,
<hi>Ricardo, Carmelio,</hi> and <hi>Ambardo,</hi> and offered great curtesie
vnto the two Princes, who did them great honour, and made
them friends with <hi>Lusiano,</hi> as persons that were without

in especiall of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> for that they sayd that in all things
he did resemble the knight of the Sunne his brother, he that
was so famous and feared in that Court, for that they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vnderstood and heard of his wonderfull acts and déeds, &amp;
vnto the king it was notorious all the whole Hystorie of
<hi>Rosicleer,</hi> from the time of his first creation &amp; bringing vp,
with his daughter the Princesse <hi>Briana,</hi> till such time as hee
was knowen vnto the Emperour his father and Empresse
his mother. Of all the which the king was verie ioyfull &amp;
pleasant, and loued the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> and his sons, as
he did his owne sonne <hi>Liriamandro,</hi> and for that he had not
vntill that time heard of the successe of the wars that he had
against the Emperour <hi>Alycandro,</hi> he was verie sorrowfull
and full of care, and thought long till y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hée had heard some
newes thereof, and if he gaue anie aide &amp; succour of knights
vnto the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> it was not for anie hatred or ill will
that he bare vnto the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> but for to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
that wherin he was bound vnto the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his sonne Prince <hi>Edward</hi> was slaine in his seruice, &amp;
was fullie perswaded that all the whole armie of the king
<hi>Oliuerio</hi> was not of sufficient power for to doe anie harme
vnto the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> yet afterwards when he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of the mightie power of Pagans that were come
vpon <hi>Grecia,</hi> it grieued and repented him of that he had done,
so that if it had not bene verie much against his honor, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times he was moued in conscience for to go and succour
him in person, with all the power that euer he could make, &amp;
being verie desirous to know the whole successe thereof in
all points, he requested the Princesse for to tell him, who (as
those that knew the truth thereof) in the presence of the
Quéene, and all those worthie Princes and knightes of the
Court, did giue him to vnderstand as well of the successe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
the king <hi>Oliuerio</hi> as with the Emperor <hi>Alycandro,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which
being published amongst them, they al receiued great ioy, in
as ample maner as though it had touched either of them in
perticular, but in especial y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> king &amp; the quéene, in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they saw
how much to their honar they had acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished their promise
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:13995:247"/>
vnto the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> as also of the high estate wherevnto
their daughter the Empresse <hi>Briana</hi> was exalted, so that they
could neuer satisfie themselues in giuing thankes vnto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
God for those great benefites shewed vnto them.
When these things were passed, straight waies came the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Leonardo</hi> and his wife, the fained parents of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi>
with whom <hi>Rosicleer</hi> receiued great pleasure, as he that had
great desire for to sée him, &amp; for that which he was indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto them, the which he did meruailouslie well gratefie
in all points their great seruice done vnto them, for he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with him vnto <hi>Grecia,</hi> whereas the Empresse <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
did make them owners of great possessions, so that they
were verie well content, and thought their trauaile verie
well emploied the which they had in the bringing vp of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer.</hi>
Likewise <hi>Rosicleer</hi> reioyced verie much with those
Gentlewomen, with whom he was brought vp in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasterie
of the Riuer, and the most part of them he carried
into <hi>Grecia,</hi> whereas he did verie much for them all. Then
for that the king dyd beare great good will vnto the Prince
<hi>Lusiano,</hi> and had him in high estimation, he straight waies
commanded that his spouse the Dutchesse of <hi>Austria</hi> should
bée deliuered vnto him. After this sort within few daies
that their nuptialls were celebrated with great honour and
triumphs, which those knights his friendes dyd ordaine, in
the which the gentle <hi>Lusiano</hi> dyd so much, that he got vnto
himselfe honour for euer after. And in the meane time of
all these sportes and feasts, <hi>Rosicleer</hi> and <hi>Lyriamandro</hi> did
declare their message vnto the king, desiring him in the
part and behalfe of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
<hi>Briana,</hi> that he woulde thinke well for to goe with
them vnto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for to reioyie themselues of the
victorie and ioy, the which the Emperour and the Empresse
doe receiue.</p>
               <p>Likewise they gaue great and lawfull excuses, wherfore
the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> did abstaine from comming into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

and Lords, that there had ben no reason for him to leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb facs="tcp:13995:248"/>
Then the king and the Quéene, as they which desired no
other thing, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded Straignt waies that all things should
be put in a readinesse néedfull for their iourney, and for that
we haue other matters to declare for the conclusion of the
first part of this Hystorie, there is héere no more to be said,
but that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> and <hi>Liriamndro</hi> did passe awaie the time

of <hi>Grecia,</hi> in the which they trauailed many
daies, without happening anie thing worthie the telling,
in the end whereof they ariued within two miles of the
mightie Citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and when the Emperour
<hi>Trebatio</hi> had knowledge of their comming, with great ioy
and pleasure, he and all those mightie Princes and valyant
knights together went out of <hi>Constantinople</hi> with so great
maiestie, that it séemed all the whole worlde were ioyned
together, the number was so excéeding great, so that the king
of <hi>Hungaria</hi> and the Queene <hi>Augusta</hi> his wife, with all
those that came with them, were wonderfullie amazed to
sée so royall and worthie knighthoode to come forth of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
for of truth they neuer woulde haue thought
that so many as there were, might haue béene receiued in
the court of anie Prince whatsoeuer he were in al the whole
world. But when the king and the Emperour sawe one an
other, they both went &amp; met together, &amp; did embrace the one
the other, with such great loue as ought to be betwéene Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:13995:248"/>
and sonne, and as though they had knowen one another
long time before. And if before the king <hi>Tiberio</hi> and the
Queene <hi>Augusta</hi> did account themselues happie &amp; fortunate
to haue so high a Prince for their sonne in law, yet now they
did much more when they sawe his person &amp; presence to be
so strange &amp; wonderfull, for alonelie by his semblance and
proportion they knew him for father of the two brethren, the
knight of the Sunne and <hi>Rosicleer;</hi> aboue all other Princes
that came in that worthie crew. The king and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

and deliuer me, for that afterwards when you should know
me you should not haue so great reason to bée sorrowfull,
as now you shoulde bée, if I had at that time béene
slaine.</p>
               <p>Then the king said: Ah my sonne, if that had happened,
my life could not haue endured so long, but God who doth
know the secret of all things that shuld happen vnto vs, did

guide and gouerne all things, in such sort, that it is come to

in knowing thée to bée my sonne, but in recouering you to

               <p>The king had scarce concluded these wordes, when that
the Quéene came to embrace the knight of the Sunne, but
he did offer to kisse her hands, and there passed betwixt them
many swéete and amorous wordes, such as might passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene

they had not séene the one the other. The Quéene <hi>Augusta</hi>

The knight of the Sunne and <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did carrie betweene

Now is my desire fullie accomplished, in that I do sée your

no conclusion of all this my victorie, neither could I receiue
anie glorie therein, till now I haue your Highnesse in my
presence, and doe honour and obey you as dutifullie as your

which you were bound vnto the king of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> had
not béene betwixt vs, I and the Empresse <hi>Briana</hi> many a

for that which is past, with lisence and consentment

<hi>Grecia,</hi> yet receiued I great griefe, for that I could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
of my part, the dutie which I owe vnto your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
When that the Emperor had concluded these words,
then the king (who receiued great pleasure thereat) sayd:
Soueraigne Emperour, if that you haue receiued great ioy,
contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and pleasure, at my comming into <hi>Grecia,</hi> how
much more reason haue I to reioyce and receue pleasure to
haue so glorious a sight of your person and presence, being

vnto the highest estate of honour that fortune may extend,
the which is apparaunt before my eyes, &amp; also endued with
such sonnes, that there is not the lyke knightes in all the

and courteous wordes the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> did gratifie
with thanks, all that which the king had sayd. So passing
betwixt them, these and many other things in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which were to long here to rehearse, they came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<pb facs="tcp:13995:250"/>
for to sée the great knighthood of that Court, for that with
great difficultie, they might passe the wide stréetes, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

thether, they all alighted and entred into the mightie broad
court, whereas the Empresse <hi>Briana</hi> dyd receiue them, with

Fathers and children, the which I doe let passe, to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chue

gallant &amp; faire, that her Father did not know her, she was
so chaunged. Yet they well perceiued in her the ioye and
pleasure she receiued, and the more to manifest her glorie,
she did shew vnto the king <hi>Tiberio</hi> and vnto the Quéene

did verie much the one for the other. But in especiall the
king of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> setting apart the great loue that he bare
vnto his sonne in law and neuew, he would accomplish his
dutie bound vnto the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> and ayde him with his
people to goe against <hi>Grecia,</hi> as hath bene told you in this

all those Lords that were there present were wise &amp; of great

answered vnto his wordes and sayd. By your word we do
vnderstand (wise king of <hi>Gedrosia)</hi> that you would declare

as of truth it is so, for that his parents shall sustaine

fortune and destinie doth promise vnto him, it shall be for a

much more ioyful shal his prosperitie &amp; good fortune be, than
his sorrowfull &amp; peruerse fortune which is ordained, great

is no peruerse fortune that can be so contrarie vnto him, to

their misfortunes, with more ioy and pleasure do inioy the

in securitie, and you shall vnderstand that I am not come
for anie other thing, but to aske and craue a bound of the
Princesse my Ladie and Mistres. At which wordes they
were all in quiet. Then the Quéene descended downe out
of the Coch with her Glasse violl in her hand, and went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Quéene then kissed her hands for the great curtesie shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the Princesse, in great hast the knight of the Sunne
and the worthie Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> her brother, arose vp with
their swords drawen in their handes, and went against the

the two knightes with such terrible blowes, that they
made them to recoile backwards with more spéed than they

them a new, they were out of the windowe with the Coch,
and being out, straight waies ceased all the tempest of

a péece of worke, the straungest to beholde that euer was

paces broade euerie waie, cut out of one stone, of so great

they caused great feare in all them that did beholde them,
and aboue ouer the doore were written Letters, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be of golde, which afterwardes were read by those
worthie Princes, who were meruailouslie amazed in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that straunge and wonderfull worke, and looking for
the Coch wherein the faire Princesse was carried, they saw
it of so great height, that it was equall with the Clowdes,
and within a little while after, in the sight of them all, the

shall passe before anie shall come for to finish the same, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
on the part of the Princesse there shall no time bée

vnto nature, of the same age that shée is now of, although
shée remaineth there one hundreth yéeres, and in all this
time shée shall not want anie thing, but of all ioy, pleasure,

in declining their heads, whereat they all meruailed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
but although there was no defence made against him at

resistance against him for the going vp the staires, for that
so soone as hée put his foote vppon the first step of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall

they hadde great reason) that he was one of the valiantest
knights in his time. And as he dyd pursue and striue for to
ascend higher, the resistance was so strong, that spight of his
heart he was forced to defend two staires of that which he
had got, he procured all that euer he could to get the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe,
but it dyd profit him little, whereby it was conuenient for
to leaue the demaund, and depart out of the Tower, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his shilde at the fiftenth stayre, so farre as he assended.
Then straight waies his brother <hi>Arcalus,</hi> entred in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
and to conclude, he dyd very well, and with great
trauaile he ascended so high as his brother <hi>Don Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but in the ende he was ouerthrowen downe the staires,
and his shielde remained and was hanged next vnto his

of the Tower. But straight waies as they would haue
put their desire in execucion, it did little profit them all that
euer they could doe, by reason that the one was in loue with
the Princesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

so that with two blowes that was strooke at them,

and therefore they retourned into the pallas,
somewhat abashed, and vnderstòode very well the secret of
the disloyall tower. Then the last that came foorth that day,
was the valiant <hi>

for that as this Historie hath told you, he was one of the
best knights in all the world, and dyd well apeare in him
the worthie stocke from whence he dyd proceede, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alighted from his horse, with his swoord in his hande,

knew what loue ment, the porters dyd let him go in,
doing their reuerence. And when he was within, he straight
waies went vp, the staires with so great lightnesse, as
though there had bene made no resistance against him, but
when that he had assendid so high and came vnto the place
whereas the other knights had bene, he was put in great
trouble and care, for that he thought all the whole world
had bene against him, the blowes were so manie and strong
where with he was charged. But this valiant and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Troyan</hi> seeing himselfe in the presence of so high prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
forced himselfe all that was possible, and ascended more
higher, laying about him on euery side, and it séemed vnto
him that he stroke his blowes vpon armed knights, so that
all that euer he dyd was for to get vnto the toppe of the
stayres. And although they that were without dyd sée but
<hi>Oristedes</hi> alone, yet dyd they heare the noyse of the great
battaile, whose thicke and mightie blowes dyd resound
thoroughout all that mightie pallas, as though a thousand
knights hadde combatted together: in this contempt was
<hi>Oristedes,</hi> and they were all greatly amazed how he could
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:13995:258"/>
fer so great trauaile, and thought verely that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
and make an ende of that aduenture. But it fel out
otherwise, for that before he came vnto the top of the staires
by foure steppes, the blowes were so many wherewith hée
was charged, that he was constrained of verie force to lose
two steppes of those which he had gotten, and neuer after
could recouer them againe, but in the ende he tombled down
the staires cleane out of all remembrance, and was thrown
out of the gate, but his shielde remained and was hanged
aboue all the rest. But when that he was come againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him selfe, he was very sorowfull, for that he could not
conquere the whole stayres, of the Tower.</p>

and the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> with all those high Princes,
dyd suppe together in the royall pallas, hauing enough to
occupie themselues in talke of the strange aduenture of the
Tower, and according vnto the condicions of the same,
they thought verely that there was very few to whom was
graunted the ascending to the toppe of those staires, for that
so worthie knights as there was receiued the repulse, for the
which the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> dyd not lette but receiue
some griefe, for that of necessitie he must be constrained to
leaue there his worthie and welbeloued daughter <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brides,</hi>
