            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Petitioners have a long time been deſtitute of a Conſcientious Miniſter to
the great prejudice of their ſoules, and griefe and ſorrow of heart, and about the
Moneth of June laſt their Vicar Doctor <hi>Carr,</hi> who was Chaplaine to the late Earle
of <hi>Straford,</hi> and Prebend of <hi>Durham,</hi> died, and about September laſt, M. <hi>Daniell
Carwardine</hi> was nominated for a Clerke to the ſaid Vicaridge of <hi>Ackeliffe</hi> by
M. <hi>Smart ſenior,</hi> Prebend of <hi>Durham,</hi> according to the Cuſtomes and Statutes of that Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall
Church, whereby your Petitioners were exceeding joyfull in hopes and aſſurance that their
ſoules ſhould have been committed to the charge of one ſo able and conſcientious, and one
whom they in their ſoules approve of and deſire; but the Prebends of the ſaid Church refuſed
to confirme the ſaid M. <hi>Carwardine</hi> ſo nominated as aforeſaid, whereupon your Lordſhips were
petitioned, and the ſaid Cuſtome exactly proved, by the teſtimonies of <hi>Nicholas Hobſon</hi> about
90. yeares of age, and <hi>Robert King</hi> in October laſt, ſince which time the great affaires of the
Kingdome not admitting the full and finall determination thereof, M. <hi>Smart</hi> tooke inſtitution for
the ſaid Vicaridge himſelfe in favour to your Petitioners, and for preſerving his owne rights,
leaſt the ſaid Uicaridge ſhould fall into the Lapſe: And the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> did write Letters
directed to the Church-wardens and others, appointing M. <hi>Carwardine</hi> to officiate in the ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
as Curate untill the buſineſſe were determined by your Lordſhips, and thereupon M. <hi>Carwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi>
did enter, and was admitted.</p>
            <p>But ſo it was that one <hi>George Leake</hi> who was Curate under Doctor <hi>Carr,</hi> who daily goeth from
Ale-houſe to Ale-houſe, where he continueth drinking whole dayes and nights, and when he
commeth from Church juſtifieth others to goe with him, being a moſt ſcandalous, deboiſt,
drunken man, hath violently entred into the ſaid Church, locked up the Pulpit-doore, broke vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
into the ſaid Uicaridge-houſe, expelled the ſaid M. <hi>Carwardine</hi> without any lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
ſo as your Petitioners are deprived of a godly, learned Preacher, and the ſaid <hi>Leake,</hi> to
the great ſorrow of your Petitioners, and ſcandall of Religion doth officiate the place.</p>
            <p>May it therefore pleaſe your good Lordſhips to commiſerate the ſad condition of your
Petitioners, and by an expreſſe Order of your Lordſhips Houſe ſettle the ſaid
M. <hi>Carwardine</hi> in the Vicaridge of <hi>Ackeliffe,</hi> or to appoint the ſaid M. <hi>Carwardine</hi> to
officiate according to the former appointment of the Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and direction
of M. <hi>Smart</hi> untill the full determination of the buſineſſe before your Lordſhips, and
that the ſaid <hi>George Leake</hi> may be ſummoned before your Lordſhips to anſwer ſuch his
ryotous diſturbance and other his misdemeanours aforeſaid,</p>
            <closer>And your Petitioners ſhall pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
