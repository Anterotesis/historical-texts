         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

should

farre for a proofe, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the just
saying of an
Ancient, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere
grata
commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione
decet scientiae pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem;</hi>
It is comely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
the Father of our
knowledge. If this be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
due from man unto man,
how much more due is it
from man unto God? For
though man be called the
<pb facs="tcp:14962:5"/>
father of those that are
taught by him,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 21.</note> yet God is
the Father of those fathers;
even a Teacher of those
teachers: and therefore by
our Saviours judgement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
only the name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in perfection and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.
Those then that have
God to be a Father of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to them, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to this Father the
praise and glorie of this
knowledge. The heavenly
gifts of God, when they
move kindly and naturally,
doe move like the Heavens,
in a circular motion; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to that place and
point from which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb facs="tcp:14962:5"/>
first to move; from God
unto God. They come from
him as graces, and returne
to him in the shape of glorie.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a measure of grace
from this heavenly Teacher,
by which I am what I am,
I could not but acknowledge
it, and by this acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
returne him glorie for
grace. And because I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
also that others may
have the like grace, that
God also from others may
have the like glorie, I testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
to others that which I
have felt and seene. I have
evidently seene and felt,
that men are taught of God;
<pb facs="tcp:14962:6"/>
and so there is a third school
for the Students of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And as they passe from
the Countrey-schoole to the
Universitie, so should they
yet mount higher to a third,
even a Celestiall Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.
And certainly, as the
second excels the first, so &amp;
much more doth the third
excell the second.</p>
            <p>Some perchance may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
with the Servant, Son,
and Heire of the Great <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah;</hi>
Hold your peace, I
know it already. Yet those
that know it, will not envie
that it be told to those that
know it not. There are sons
of the Prophets that must
<pb facs="tcp:14962:6"/>
grow up like young plants in
the house of the Lord; and
those have a time when they
know it not, and this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
may meet with that
time. Yea there may be
some Masters in Israel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whose eares perchance it
hath passed, but not entered
into their hearts, that as a
man must be borne, so hee
must be taught from above.
And if this naile be driven
beyond hearing, into know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
experience, and taste,
I hope no man will be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
for such a gaine. Besides,
too true and common it is,
that the naturall heart of
man willingly lies downe
<pb facs="tcp:14962:7"/>
and takes up its rest in the
abilities of Nature; and
fetcheth oracles from thence
(the cause of so many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and differences the
consequences of errours) and
therefore hath it need of
such goads to awake it, and
to make it open the eye and
eare to this heavenly Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</p>
            <p>It is most true, that those
who have not beene taught
in this higher schoole of
Grace, but onely in the lower
of Nature, cannot well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that which they
know not; this schoole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
best learned, known, and
acknowledged, by those
<pb facs="tcp:14962:7"/>
whom it most teacheth. And
those who have beene well
taught there, doe well know,
that Christians are herein
better than their neighbors,
even than the best of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
because they are taught
by God, the best, most trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent,
and infallible Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.
The heavenly Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
teacheth them both
what and how to beleeve;
he gives them his heavenly
truths contained in his
Word; and gives them
withall an heavenly mind
to discerne, beleeve, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them. And thus while
a Christian holds his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by an heavenly hand, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:14962:8"/>
both are given him by an
heavenly Teacher: a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
tenure of religion is
far more noble, excellent,
and assured than that of
the Pagan. A Christian
thus taught from above, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
and worships what
he knowes, whereas the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
worships what hee
knowes not; even that
which be hath received only
by the way of Nature, from
naturall, deceived, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
men: But the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
hath a spirit from God
in Christ Iesus (for if any
man have not the spirit of
Christ, he is not Christs) and
this Spirit gives him a
<pb facs="tcp:14962:8"/>
spiritual eye, which an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
hath not; and yet this
eye alone, can truly and
kindly discerne and see
spirituall and heavenly
truths. And for this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
eye, which the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
hath from the Spirit of
God, the Heathens and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans
may say among
themselves of a Christian,
as once an Heathen King
said to his Heathen Subjects
of <hi>Joseph: Can wee find
such a man as this? a man
in whom is the Spirit of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that such Christians
may abound, is the end of
this work, which for ought I
<pb facs="tcp:14962:9"/>
know, hath not beene over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought,
nor thereby made
superfluous and unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the present age.<note place="margin">Socin.</note> I
wish that fetching heavenly
knowledge from carnall
reason and humane wit,
have not made it too seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
Yet to turn men back
the more willingly from
this counter-course, I have
brought forth patternes of
some, who have taught and
professed a deniall of their
own wits and reasons, though
acute and excellent; and
have (as it were) quenched
their owne naturall lamps,
that they might get them
kindled above by the Father
<pb facs="tcp:14962:9"/>
of lights. Yea, thus did
sundry of them, even in
those times, when humane
wit and reason had made too
great a mixture with the
mysteries of Divinitie. Yet
then did God preserve the
soveraigntie of his owne
light in eminence and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
by the homage of these
mens confessions, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
to that light. And
if such high thoughts and
imaginations (that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
doe most exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
taught of God) doe
thus submit unto it, the
lower should not be high
when the higher are low.</p>

Christ having

he infers a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

from his practice;
therefore everie Scribe
which is instructed to the

like unto a man that is an
Housholder, which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
forth out of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
things both new and

            <p>Whosoever then would
expresse the best chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of an heavenly Scribe,
from whence should hee
rather take it, than from
the best patterne, lively
set forth by the best and
highest Teacher, who was
that which hee described,
and described that which
hee was? And whereas
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14962:11"/>
our actions must be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

draw rules from his
owne actions.</p>
            <p>Having then so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
both a Patterne and
a Teacher, let us boldly
frame the character of
our heavenly Scribe, to
the shape both of this
chiefe Doctor, and of his
Doctrine. Accordingly
wee will commend to our
Scribe things both new
and old (but the old first,
because they are first) and
after him who is Truth,
will lay downe this true
position; That toward
the making of a learned
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14962:12"/>
Scribe, there is a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to be gained by
the gathering of old things
into his treasurie. The
Scribe that wil be learned,
may be a gatherer of old
things; and so let him be.
Let him gather into his
treasurie the things of
Nature, yea gather a stock
of them, and lay them up
for his use, when he comes
to the new. Let him know
in a competent measure
what is to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in the old Creation;
yea, let him learne what is
copied out of it by art
and industrie, to serve him
in the things of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14962:12"/>
and if in this search
he meet with the learning
of the Aegyptians, he may
carrie their jewels into his
treasurie. Let an Heathen
Logician or Philosopher,
be his Gibeonite to cleave
wood, and to draw water
for his service in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie.
Let the one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,
define, and order;
and the other draw secrets
from the depths of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to serve the Lords
servants in the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
Let the precept and
patternes of vertues, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and stories, serve
for spurs and incentives to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14962:13"/>
grace, to goe beyond the
effects of Nature; and for
exprobrations when shee
doth it not. And let the
languages both of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleever,
and Mis-belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
serve for keyes to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to new men, those
mysteries which the old
men see not, neither doe
open to themselves, though
the keies be in their hands.</p>
            <p>Such old things as these
are earthly needles, that
may draw in heavenly
truths: They are earthly
glasses, that may help our
eyes to a clearer discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of heavenly images:
they may help to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14962:13"/>
to insinuate, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and to gaine. By
them the new man may
be a Grecian to the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
to gaine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the Grecians; and a
Jew to the Jewes; to gaine
or convince the Jewes; and
all things to all men, to
win some. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
the most laborious
Scholler of the greatest
Master, though sometime
rapt up into the heavenly
Schoole, yet when hee is
among the Jewes, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
them by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets<note place="margin">Acts 26. 22.</note>
received of the
Jewes; and when he is at
Athens among the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14962:14"/>
hee convinceth them
also by their owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
even learned Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,<note place="margin">Acts 17. 28.</note>
by their Heathen
Poet.</p>
            <p>Lastly, this Scribe in
the lower Academie, may
improve the abilities of
Nature, given him by the
first and old creation. For
these old things will grow
by use and exercise, and
likewise become excellent
instruments in the new e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
there being no little

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14962:24"/>
lesson of happinesse. The
besenesse and sensualitie
of mans heart will lye
downe below the due e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation,
price, and love
of these pearles; and not
suffer it to open it selfe,
though it be to a Saviour
bringing blessednes with
him. It will not give a
messe of temporall profit,
preferment, or pleasure,
for an heavenly birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and a glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.
It will account
it the chiefe learning, to
learne some new promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
lands, and lordships:
and no wonder, for it
takes onely visible things
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14962:25"/>

be but temporall, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

though the things not
seene are an enduring sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
for all eternitie.
But the schollers taught
in the schoole of Christ,
account it their chiefe
learning to learne, and by
learning to receive Christ
with his blessings and
blessednesse; whom the
more they thus learne,
the higher are they estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

            <p>THere is yet another
eminent, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
learning given us
by our heavenly Teacher
in his highest schoole, and
that is, a mysterious and
secret, yet an assured, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and exceeding dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
knowledge, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from experience
and taste. By the first
teaching, we rightly saw
the things of God presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to us by God. By
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14962:26"/>
the second wee were
taught to receive and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
them. By the third,
after we have tasted those
heavenly things whereof
we were possessed, from
this taste there ariseth a
new, but a true, lively, and
experimentall knowledge
of the things so tasted.
And indeed this is a
knowledge<note n="a" place="margin">Sicut mellis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura non adeò verbo persuaderi iis, qui minimè sunt experti, quantum in ipso gustu cognosci po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test; sic nec coelestis verbi suavitas clarè praeceptis, aut doctrinis tradi poterit.

For even in naturall fruits
there are certain rellishes,
and, as I may call them,
Idaea's and characters of
tastes, which nothing but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14962:27"/>
the taste it selfe can truly
represent and shew unto
us. The West-Indian Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
cannot be so expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in words, even by him
that hath tasted it, that he
can deliver over the true
shape and character of
that taste to another that
hath not tasted it. And
yet have we other fruits,
that by some kindred
may seeme to counterfeit
some lineaments of that
taste. But no earthly
things can in any degree
give us the true taste of
the heavenly; but the
heavenly are left to bee
knowne by their owne
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14962:27"/>
taste. The Scripture
therefore useth earthly
things, that by them wee
may ascend above them;
and that not finding in
earthly things what the
heavenly things are, wee
may ascend up to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things themselves,
by tasting truly to know
them. In one place we are
told, That Christs love
is pleasanter than wine;
and in another, That the
Lawes of God are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santer
than honey: Here
by the pleasantnesse of
wine wee doe not learne
the true shape of the
pleasure of Christs love:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14962:28"/>
for this is another kind of
pleasure, than the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santnesse
of wine: Neither
in the sweetnesse of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
doe wee truly see the
sweetnesse of Gods Law;
for it is a different kind of
sweetnes which the soule
tasteth in the Law, and
the body tasteth in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Yea, the verie Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
it selfe which was visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
doth not give the
true taste of the hidden &amp;
invisible Manna; but it is
still hidden, except it bee

Therefore the high and
heavenly Teacher (by the
Psalmist) first calls on us
to taste, and after to see,
even to get that sight and
knowledge which is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
onely by tasting. By
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14962:30"/>
tasting the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
God teacheth us
to know what the things
are; and the more wee
know them, the more we
shall love them; and the
more wee love them, the
more we shall taste them;
and the more wee taste
them, the more wee shall
know them. And thus shal
we run on in an<note n="d" place="margin">Ettra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit prius mensura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steà illis sicut gustantibus lumen, &amp; magis desideranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus magis seipsum immittit, &amp; abundanter su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfulget, quoniam dilexerunt multum; &amp; semper extendit ipsas ad anteriora. <hi>Dionys.

such an assurance of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,

            <p>Toward a generall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverie

take notice, That Christ
Jesus when hee ascended
up on high, and received
from his Father all power
both in Heaven and earth,
did undertake the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of his own Church.<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 7, 8, 11, 12.</note>
And for the perfecting of
this holy building hee
sent downe gifts unto

made able and skilfull
Builders. And no doubt
these are the best &amp; most
able Teachers, whom

Christ the great Lord of

how can any man thinke

Wherefore the Giver of

those gifts. And as the
Disciples stayed in Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
untill they were
endued with the power
of teaching from on high:
so let men that stay in the

stay, earnestly seeke to
receive a power from on

wholly look downward,
as if from thence they
could receive the gifts
that are given from

downe, they may see the
gifts that are come down
upon others (though not
upon themselves) and
they may pick up the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14962:38"/>
crums that fall from the
tables of these Masters:
and making up these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
loaves, they may give
them to the hungrie. But
it must needs be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that this is a lower
kind of abilitie in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
seeing that which
lends to this must needs
be the higher; the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
here also being a
a servant, and therefore
inferiour to the lender.
And it seemes, that not so
much these, as they that
received those gifts from
on high, doe build by
these. But those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
gifts from on high,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14962:39"/>
either take not all at the
second hand, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
at the first; or if they
make use of things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
taught by the gifts
of others, they doe (as it
were) quicken and enlive
them by their owne gift,
and so send them forth
newly animated by the
same Spirit which spake
them. Yea, by this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
they often make them
not onely to live, but to
grow to a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of light or heat,
by enlarging them unto
more instruction, or kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them unto a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive
excitation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:14962:39"/>
But if we will yet take
a more punctuall notice
of the excellencies of this
heavenly teaching of
Teachers, wee may take a
more particular survey of
some eminent abilities gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with the gifts of the
highest Teacher.</p>
            <p>A first is, a spirituall

               </note> light, given
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14962:40"/>
commonly in an eminent
and more than ordinarie
measure, to those that are
enabled and taught from
above to bee spirituall
Teachers.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6.</note> God who
commanded light to shine
out of darknesse, shines
in their hearts, to give the
light of the knowledge
of the glorie of God
in the face of Jesus
Christ. They receive
light, that they may
turne others from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to light, and shew
them the way of peace,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14962:40"/>
which by this light they
have discovered. They
have an <hi>Urim</hi> from on
high; and a spirituall
light and sight, by which
they become eyes to the
blind, and a light to them
that sit in darknesse. The
great Shepherd of soules,
and Master of the highest
schoole, doth not send out
from his schoole the
blind to guid the blind,
that both may fall into
the ditch, but hee makes
shining &amp; burning lights,
that they which see them
may not onely rejoyce
in their light, but bee led
by it to the enjoying of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14962:41"/>
the supreme &amp; soveraigne
light, in the vision of
whom is perfect blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
And hee that hath
this light hath the key of
knowledge, by which he
can open the mysteries of
salvation, and discover
the counsells of God, and
see the mind of Christ,
and find out wonders in
Gods Law. He pierceth
into the inward veine of
the word, and (as it were)
lets it bloud, and causeth
to spring from it a floud
of doctrine: whereas the
same word to another
that hath not this light,
seemes like the Rocke

whereof it was said; <hi>Shall
I fetch you water out of

            <p>Secondly, from this
higher Academie comes
that abilitie of teaching,
which teacheth by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
There is a teaching
by word, and a teaching
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14962:42"/>
by conversation; and if
this latter be required of
women, much more of
those men, who are the
Teachers and Fishers of
men.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 1.</note> They that teach by
word onely, seeme to
build with one hand one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
they that teach by
word and example, build
with two hands; but
they that teach by word,
and destroy by example,
doe build with one hand,
and pull downe with the
other. And certainly, if
they destroy what they
build, they are great tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spassers,
and foolish buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> shewes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14962:43"/>
himselfe a wise Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builder,
while hee makes
himselfe a patterne of his
owne doctrine; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a follower of Christ,
calls upon his flock to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, as hee followes
Christ. Hee calls upon
them to do, not only what
they have heard, but
what they have seene in
him:<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 9.</note> and see what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
such teaching, and
such learning; The God
of peace shall bee with
you.</p>
            <p>And this teaching by
patterne doth he deliver
over to his spirituall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie;
for he calls upon
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14962:43"/>
               <hi>Timothy</hi> his son (and by
him upon his sons sons,
even all the sons of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>)
to bee a walking
Word, and a visible Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 12.</note>
even a patterne of
Beleevers,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 2.</note> both in word
and conversation.</p>
            <p>True it is, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
should doe as the
Teachers say, and not as
they doe, when they say
Christs spirituall words,
and doe their owne car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
works. But such is
the corruption of fallen
man-kind, both in sight
and affection, that in sight
it rather lookes on out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly-visible
workes,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14962:44"/>
than inward, invisible, and
spirituall words, and in
aff<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction it is more apt to
follow carnall examples
than heavenly rules. And
this being a pestilence,
wherewith man-kind is
apt to bee infected to
death, how fearefull is it
to bring such a plague in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a flock?</p>
            <p>But on the contrarie, a
holy life joyned to sound
doctrine, is a continuall
testimony and martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the doctrine.
Such a life commends the
doctrine to the beleefe
and love of men. It per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth
a possibilitie, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14962:44"/>
sheweth a facilitie of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. What we see done,
we thinke may be done,
and when wee see a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
before us, we doe it
much the more easily and
perfectly. Now that
Teachers may bee such
patterns of light, inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
burning, &amp; outwardly
shining, let them repaire
to the Father of lights;
who from this higher A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademie,
baptizeth with
that fire which not onely
kindleth light in the souls
of his Messengers, but
makes his Ministers a
flame of fire. And, if
thus kindled from above,

shal be added to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the highest
Schoole, and no other,
teacheth the Art of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall
Divinitie,
which being learned, doth
give an excellence and
Crowne to the abilitie of
teaching. There is great
oddes betweene an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced,
and a meerely-contemplative
Captaine.
And if the great Captaine
of our salvation learned
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14962:46"/>
experimentall obedience
by the things which hee
suffered, and by his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
experimentally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
and knowne, knowes
how to take due notice,
consideration, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
of those that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
how much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
may we thinke is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to his Under-Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
by their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the Christian war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare?
An heavenly Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
run the race of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 8, 9.</note>
through honour
and dishonour, through
evill and good report; as
unknown, &amp; yet known;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14962:47"/>
as dying, and yet living;
as sorrowfull, and yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
rejoycing; as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing, and yet pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
all things: such an
one (I say) when he meets
with soules in the like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of honour, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,
and the other
differences incident to a
Christians life, he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
out of his owne
experience draw forth
lessons of direction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe,
or consolation:
yea, out of his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
hee can almost
fore-prophesie events,
and fore-tell issues out of
tentation. And indeed, as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14962:47"/>
in other states of soule,
so especially in the case
of a broken spirit, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentall
Teachers have
an high &amp; eminent advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
For such an one
lookes back to his owne
soule, and there reads the
storie of it imprinted by
experience, and from
thence tells the distressed
soule, both the crosse
which shee endures, and
the joy set before her.
Hee talks with the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
soule in her owne
language, having thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learned it in this high
schoole of experience:
and when the grieved
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14962:48"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:14962:48"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:14962:49"/>
soule doth but heare the
Teacher speaking this
language, she is received:
yea, when she heares him
speake so truely of the
griefe, shee beleeves it is
possible, and perchance
likely, that there may bee
truth in his comforts:
yea, it is no small comfort
to the distressed soule, by
such infallible and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
descriptions, to find
and heare one that hath
beene in the like distresse
wherin shee is now affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
For one of their
greatest terrours ariseth
hence, that none was ever
in their case; and that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14962:49"/>
the Almightie hath sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
them out from all
the world, to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
marks of his arrowes.
Besides, when these men
bring consolations for
tribulations, they bring
sure and sound ones; for
they bring everie one of
them with a <hi>Probatum.</hi>
They can name the man
that was cured by them,
and say with the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist;
This poore man
cryed unto the Lord, and
thus was heard, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and healed. With
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they comfort
others with the verie
same consolations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14962:50"/>
with themselves have
beene comforted of God.
Thus this skill of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Divinitie gives
an advantage of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and not of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
onely, but of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to the Teacher; for
he sayes what he knowes:
and on the other side, it
gives an advantage of
trust and comfort to the
hearer.</p>
            <p>But the inexperienced
man, when he comes to a
soule set on the rack of a
tortured conscience, and
there uttering the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
expressions of a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
mind; this distressed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14962:50"/>
soule is a Barbarian to
him, and he is a Barbarian
to her. She speakes what
hee understands not, and
he cannot speake to her in
a language which she can
comfortably understand.
But this Teacher is often
of the same opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this troubled
soule, which Christs car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
kinsmen had concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him;<note place="margin">Mark. 3.</note> They sent out
to lay hold on him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Hee is besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
And no wonder,
for they never saw sin in
the true ugly shape of it;
they were never upon
mount Sinai, neither did
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14962:51"/>
they there heare the
thunders and lightenings
of the Law against sin;
and therefore they are not
like <hi>Moses,</hi> who did
quake and tremble. Yea,
this quaking and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
is so strange to
them, that they aske with
wonder of these amazed
soules: Why did ye skip
as Rams, and tremble as
little Lambs? To whom
it may bee answered: It
was at the presence of
God on Sinai.</p>
            <p>Againe, on the other
side, when the time is
come, wherein God calls
out; Comfort yee, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14962:51"/>
yee my people:
there is no balme in their
Gilead, there is no oyle
of joy in their lamps:
they have not had the
fore-going tribulations,
nor the following conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations:
Therefore if they
would give consolations,
they must bee borrowed
ones (like the axe of the
the young Prophet) and
not the verie same by
which themselves have
beene comforted of God.
Yea, commonly for want
of experience, they know
not the Crisis of a soule,
nor when the soule is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a turne, and is come to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14962:52"/>
the season of receiving
consolation. They know
not the houre of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
when hee is ready
to turne the water of tears
into the wine of consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And therefore such
an one often misplaceth
his spirituall physick, and
gives restoratives to a
soule not thorowly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from the love of sin,
or while the fit is upon
the soule; when it were
more fit to weepe with
them that either doe, or
should weepe; and by
that agreement in wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
to draw the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
soule to a second
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14962:52"/>
agreement, even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
with him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth.
For this is the
wisedome of a Teacher,
experimentally taught
from above; and this
wisedome is justified, and
in high estimation with
all her children.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, from the
heavenly schoole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
a mightie, active,
and maine advancement
of teaching, and that is, a
storge, or naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
given to a Teacher.
There is a gift of love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
by God into the
heart of a Teacher, by
which hee is taught of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14962:53"/>
God to love his Flock;
and this love inflameth,
constraineth, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him to teach. In St.
<hi>Paul</hi> we see deep impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and powerfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of this love:
yea, we see him as a man
all on fire with this love;
so that for the love of
soules,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 23, &amp;c.</note> wearinesse and
watching, hunger and
thirst, cold and nakednes,
perils and persecutions,
are all but as stubble in
his way; and the fire of
love, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hath eaten him
up, consumes them also,
and turnes them into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
He feeds his sheep
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14962:53"/>
sometimes at his owne
costs, and with an holy
symony buyes the work
of his owne ministerie,
and straines for an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to approve it. For
whereas hee might call<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 14.</note>
himselfe a Labourer, and
so might plead for the
wages due to his worke,
hee calls himselfe a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that thence hee may
fetch a reason of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for his children.
Yea, he doth not expresse
his love onely under this
title of a Father, (though
that character being well
stamped on a Pastor, with
the affections belonging
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14962:54"/>
to it, would make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
and industriously
carefull for the good of
the flock) but he descends
into the lownesse, and (as
it were) the fondnesse of
a Nurse:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 1, 2.</note> He softly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
and dandles,<note place="margin">Hebr. 5. 11, 12.</note> as a
Nurse her children,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. 7, 8.</note> and
speakes halfe-words, low
doctrines to them, when
he sees they are not gone
beyond milk, nor come
to the digestion of stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
meat. Yea, hee is so
fervently affectionate to
them, that hee is willing
to have imparted to
them, not the Gospel of
God onely, but his owne
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14962:54"/>
soule. And hee addes the
reason; Because they
were deare unto him.
Hence we learn, That it is
the dearnesse of the flock,
which is the maine spring
that sets all on working.
This is it which imparts
the Gospel willingly, and
not for constraint and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre:
This is it that makes
a Teacher instant in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and our of season:
Briefly this is it which
makes him with pleasure
to undergoe all labours,
even from the watching
of one houre, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
of his soule or
life. So that if you exhort
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14962:55"/>
a Pastor to visit the sick,
you exhort him but to
one dutie; if you incite
him also to comfort the
weake-hearted, you invite
him but to two; but if
you could give him love,
you give him a Spring and
Incentive, that would
move him to these, and
all other good duties.
And this love is taught
by the highest Teacher:
for hee is Love in the
Fountaine, and all Love
besides himselfe, is a
streame of this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>But on the other side,
where this Love is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

are done dully and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the doers of them
are like the wheeles of
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> chariots in the
the red sea, they move
verie heavily. The fire
of love is out, by which
being enflamed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
heat unto others; and
the zeale is wanting, by
which they should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
many. They have
not in them the affections
of Fathers, and therefore
their flocks appeare to
them in the shape of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14962:56"/>
bastards, and not of sons.
Accordingly they often
set them our, as some doe
their base children to
wanderers, and such as
will take them best cheap:
or if they give them any
food, their hearts goe not
with it, neither doe they
care whether it doe them
good, or they doe grow
and prosper by it. And
though perchance one of
these may act the part of
a Lover, yet commonly
it will shew like an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Scene; that only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the most part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable,

serious, which is naturall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:14962:56"/>
Therefore take such an
one as <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 19, 20.</note> that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
(and not artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally)
cares for the Church,
and there is no artificiall
man that is like minded
to him: for he takes care
not only for some pieces,
but for the whole estate
of the Church. And hee
works not pieces of Gods
worke, but the whole
work of the Lord; yea,
hee works it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 10.</note> as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
did; and how hee did it,
wee have seene before.
And if you will see the
root of it, looke into his

shall see the bowells of<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 8.</note>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:14962:57"/>
Christ Jesus.<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 8.</note> The bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells
of Christ Jesus, that

the bowells of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
that accounted the
gaine of soules to be his

of Christ Jesus, that
have in them the greatest
love to the flocke: for
greater love hath no man,
than he that layeth down
his life for his flocke.
These bowells are in St.
<hi>Paul:</hi> and therefore no
wonder, if having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the bowells of
Christ, by the spirit of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14962:57"/>
Christ, hee walke in the
steps of Christ, while he
walketh by the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ.</p>
            <p>Behold then here the
most excellent way, even
the way of love, which
teacheth the Teacher, &amp;
directs him into all the
wayes of profiting his
flock. And this teaching
love is it selfe taught by
the highest Teacher,<note place="margin">1 Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. 16.</note>
whose name, and nature,
&amp; verie being is love; and
by whom men are taught
to love one another; He
it was, that did put an
earnest care of the Church<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 9.</note>
into the heart of <hi>Titus;</hi> &amp;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14962:58"/>
therefore hee it was also,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 16.</note>
that did put the bowells
of love into him,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 15.</note> from
which issued this care.
And if thou hast the same
bowells, thy flocke will
be thy children, and thou
wilt be a father to them:
in their reigning, thou
shalt reigne; they will be
thy joy and thy crowne

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14962:58"/>
because thou hast

that there is a higher A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademie
as well as a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and that the higher
hath some excellencies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the lower. True it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14962:59"/>
is, that though there be a
difference, yet there must
not necessarily follow a
division: yea, much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there should follow
a conjunction; and hee
that is in the lower,
should strive to bee in

this is a maine businesse
of this worke, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne
things which God

not to diminish, but to

it up to the higher.</p>
            <p>Now to ascend from
the lower to the higher,
there are certaine staires
and steps, by which men
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14962:59"/>
usually goe up, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Disciples and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pills
of the heavenly
Teacher. A first step is
that which should ever
bee first in intention,
though last in assecution;
A right end. When wee
come to God to bee
taught, we must propose
an end worthy of God;
And surely none but God
is an end worthy of God.
A most perverse and base
disorder it were, to make
man the end of God; and
much more confused and
disorderly were it, to
make God to serve man,
in his service of some base
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14962:60"/>
lust: for then may he not
only say, Thou hast made
me to serve with thy sins;
but, thou hast made me to
serve thy sins. Thou put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
God below thy sins,
and puttest thy sins to be
thy gods. And how canst
thou expect that God
should by his teaching
give thee an excellence
above others, when thou
by his owne gifts doest
intend to put, either his
creature which hee hath
made, or sin which hee
made not, above him; and
him infinitely below
himselfe. Wherefore let

preferment, thy end;
but account and propose
God himselfe before
thee, as thy highest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
exceeding great
reward, and all-sufficient
end. Neither make earth
the end of Heaven, nor
put the god Mammon in
the place of the true God,
neither seeke the gifts of
his Spirit, that thou
mayest make money of
them. This is a right, and
withall a most base sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14962:61"/>
thy selfe to receive
the answer which was
made unto <hi>Simon</hi> thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Thou art in the
gall of bitternesse, and
bond of iniquitie; and
thou art verie unfit for a
part and fellowship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Disciples of
the heavenly Teacher.
Know that this high A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademie
is not a place for
Prentices, therein to learn
a trade and occupation
for worldly gaine; but
the Teacher being the
King of Heaven, hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
his Schollers to be
Kings; even first to seek,
and at last to attaine an
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14962:61"/>
heavenly Kingdom. And
earthly things are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be given as atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
upon this heavenly
Kingdome. Therefore as
as the Heaven is high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the earth, so let it be
in thy thought and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
make God thy end,
who makes Heaven by
his presence to be Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Desire his gifts, to
glorifie the Giver by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
here, and to be glorified
by him hereafter eternally
in his heavenly Kingdom.
But if thou make earth
thy heaven, and this
world thy god; this false
heaven, and false god af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14962:62"/>
a while will forsake
thee, and the true Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and true GOD,
whom thou hast despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
will not receive thee.
In the meane time expect
no gift from God, except
such as the Quailes, which
perchance may bring
some food to thy lust, but
leannesse and judgement
to thy soule. If with <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi>
thou lookest out
for prophecies, that by
them thou mightst gaine
the wages of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
though thou fall
into a trance, and art en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,
to make others
see by thy light; yet
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14962:62"/>
thou thy selfe art still a
child of darknesse, and by
thy light encreasest thy
owne stripes; and being
in the way of <hi>Balaam,</hi> art
likely to come to his
wayes end, even a death
among the unrighteous.</p>
            <p>Yea, seeke not the gifts
themselves for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
neither make them
their owne end. It is a
pleasant thing for the
eye of the body to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the light of the Sun;
but to behold a spirituall
light, which shineth from
the highest light, is farre
more pleasant to a spirit:
yet must a reasonable spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14962:63"/>
know, that to behold
the highest Spirit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
is the highest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and therefore these
lower gifts of the Spirit
are far more valuable, for
shewing us by their light
the way to the sight of
the highest Spirit, than
for the light it selfe by
which they shew it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it remaines
still, that God be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
as the end of his gifts,
whereof hee is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
God was his owne
end in the giving of them,
and it is both thy dutie,
wisedome, and benefit, to
have the same end which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14962:63"/>
he hath. If thou joyne
with God in his end, it is
most likely he will joyne
with thee in the meanes,
and in the increase of
them toward his owne
end. For God will not
be wanting to his owne
end, which were to bee
wanting to himselfe.
Therefore enlarge thy
selfe as much as thou
canst, in this intention of
making God thy end,
wherein the more thou
increasest, the more it is
likely he will increase his
teaching of thee, and the
degrees of his gifts in
thee. And according to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14962:64"/>
thy degrees of grace, shall
be thy degrees in glorie:
as thou hast sought him
much in the gifts of his
grace, so by them shalt
thou find him much here,
and much enjoy him
hereafter in glorie.</p>

               <p>A second step: Deniall of
mans wit and wisedome.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HE that will ascend
up to the heavenly
Schoole, there to bee
taught of God, must leave
mans carnall wit and
wisedome behind him, as
<hi>Abraham</hi> left his Asses at
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14962:64"/>
the foot of the mount.
The wisedome of man,
saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
before God; and
the naturall man discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not the things of
God: therefore if thou
endevourest by thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
wit to discerne
the things of God, thy
labor is employed rather
not to discerne them:
thou mayest perchance
conceive, and after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
bastard, mis-begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and false shapes of
them; but the things
themselves, in their true
shapes, thou doest not see
and perceive. The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14962:65"/>
wit seeth the shapes
which it selfe puts upon
spirituall things, and not
what they themselves do
beare, and indeed appeare
in, to a spirituall eye.
And surely if mans wit
see, and by seeing teach it
selfe truly the things of
God, what need were
there of an heavenly Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher?
But because thou
art naturally blind to the
things of God, and they
are onely spiritually to
bee discerned, therefore
must thou goe up to a
spirit, to give thee a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
eye-sight, that so
thou mayest spiritually
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14962:65"/>
discerne them. And when
thou goest up, to get a
spirituall mind of the
great Father of Spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
remember to put off thy
carnall wit and wisdome,
which must be stript off
before thou canst put on
the other. The keeping
of thy naturall and carnall
wit, is the keeping of thy
folly; and this folly will
cast her owne colour on
the things of God, and
make them seeme folly to
thee, or onely wise in
that colour which that
casts upon them. And
this is a reason why the
greatest wits doe stumble
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14962:66"/>
so often at the wisedome
of God, upon which they
behold the shape of folly,
of their owne setting on;
and why they fall into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
thinking to mend
Gods wisedome by their
wits; and why them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
though professing
themselves wise, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
fooles; even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they think and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
themselves to bee
wise. While they think
their owne wits to be fit
instruments for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
of Gods wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
they not finding
his, wisedome to be wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
by their wits, they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14962:66"/>
censure it to bee folly;
and therefore goe about
to correct it, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to pervert it. In the
meane time it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
folly, which puts the
shape and title of folly
upon the greatest wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and goes about to
amend wisedome with
folly. And thus are these
wise men taken in their
owne wisedome; for
their owne wisedome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a snare to them,
and makes them first, and
after takes them as fooles.
Yea, miserie and folly are
met together in them, and
that in a highest degree,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14962:67"/>
while they see not, but
censure and reject the
most wise mysteries of
God, which offer and
present to them salvation,
and eternall felicitie.</p>
            <p>Therefore let the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Scholler put off his
owne earthly and carnall
wisedome, and goe up to
God for a new Principle,
even a new mind, by
which hee may truly see
and know the things of
God. The new world of
Divinitie must be begun
in a man, as God began
the old world, it must
have nothing for a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
and when man
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14962:67"/>
is nothing in himselfe,
then God will begin to
create, and make him
something. This is that
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith: Let
him bee a foole, that hee
may be wise. For indeed,
that which thou thinkest
to be thy wisedome, thou
must put off, and make it
vanish into nothing, being
a foole in regard of that
wisedome; and so thou
shalt be made wise in the
true wisedome. But this
is not perfected at once.
Therefore, as at thy first
entrance into the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Academie, thou must
begin a deniall, and anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14962:68"/>
of thy owne wit
and wisedome, so after
thou art entred, thou must
strive to continue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
this deniall: for
though thou doe in will
and purpose put it off, and
deny it wholly at first;
yet in act it is not wholly
put off, it being part of the
remaining body of sin,
which hangeth so fast on,
that it cannot wholly bee
put off, untill man be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.
But thou must
strive to get ground of it
while thou livest; and the
greater thy naturall wit
is, the more must thou
strive. For the greater it
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14962:68"/>
is, the more apt will it be
to see reasons by it selfe,
and without Gods teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which will fall out
too often to bee reasons
against Gods reasons, and
wit against Gods wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And the admission
of humane wit, against
Gods wisedome, by some
great wits, (that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
first in purpose or
profession submitted to
the wisedome of God)
hath beene the cause of
many dangerous errours
in the Church. I say, A
mixture of mans wit with
the Divine Word, hath
bred Mules in Divinitie,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14962:69"/>
even confused, foolish, and
mishapen errours. But let
the learner in this high
Academie lay aside his
owne sight, which is blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and get from his
Teacher that eye-salve,
which may give him spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
discerning. Let
him keep his wit in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
captivitie, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivenesse
to the Spirit of
God; and beware that
by no meanes hee make
that portion of Spirit
which is in him, to suffer
under the activitie of his
owne carnall wit. But
having received an eye
from God, let him see
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14962:69"/>
Gods matters with Gods
eye, and so shall hee keep
himselfe safe from error,
and shall bee led into the
truth. For a mind given
of God, doth approve
onely the truth of God.
And though in this life of
imperfection, no man
have so much spirituall
light, as to discerne all
truth; yet the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
light, which every spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
man that is taught
of God receiveth, is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for the discoverie,
or discerning of so much
truth, as may lead him
like a streame to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
and fulnesse of truth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14962:70"/>
and blessednesse. And for
a preparation toward this
fulnesse, let him work out,
and endevour to perfect
his owne emptinesse: for
the more degrees hee
gaines of this emptinesse,
the more degrees shall he
receive of Gods fulnesse;
even of his teaching
grace here, and his crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

The secret of the Lord is<note place="margin">Psal. 25. 14.</note>
with them that feare him;
and his covenant, to make
them to know it. Hee
hath not onely made a
covenant with them, but
hee makes them to know
it; he doth both give it,
and teach it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is a
friendship between those
that are conformed unto
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14962:72"/>
God, and God to whom
they are conformed. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
the father of the
faithfull, was called the
friend of God; and the
faithfull children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
are also called his
friends. God is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementer,
and therefore
if hee allow them the
terme, hee allowes them
also the truth of this
friendship.<note place="margin">Joh. 15. 15.</note> Yee are my
friends (saith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our)
if yee doe whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I command you.
Now wee know that
a friend will tell a friend
his counsells. So saith our
Saviour, Because yee are
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14962:73"/>
my friends, therefore
whatsover I have heard
of the Father, I make
knowne unto you.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there is a
marriage between Christ
and his Church, the
Church in this marriage
is one spirit with him, as
in naturall marriages two
are one flesh. And if
there be such a marriage,
there is also a marriage-love
betweene them.
Now marriage-love doth
communicate counsells:
and it is so hard, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
for marriage-love
to deny such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14962:73"/>
who could onely
make her challenge upon
a counterfeit shape of
marriage, yet thinks it fit
to object this question:
How canst thou say that
thou lovest me, when thy
heart is not with mee?
And why is not his heart
with her; Because hee
doth not tell her his
counsells? even such
counsells, as being told,
may endanger his libertie
and life. But Christ, the
best husband, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
his life for his
Spouse, and himselfe to
his Spouse in a sacred
union, how shall hee not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14962:74"/>
with his life and himselfe
give her his counsells al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so?
It is his owne word:
If the wives be ignorant
or doubtfull, let them
aske their husbands.
Herein hee implyeth,
That if the wives doe ask
their husbands, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asked should be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to reach their wives.
Surely, if Christ require
this willingnesse to teach
in lower and meaner hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
whose knowledge,
yea whose love cannot be
here in perfection, will
not this husband, who is
light it selfe and love it
selfe, teach his owne wife
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14962:74"/>
by this most perfect
light, and from this most
perfect love? Yea cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely,
in the bed of love
he will not onely tell her
the words of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 20, 27.</note>
but by a sacred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
(being one spirit
with her) hee will make
her to see the counsells of
his words: hee will give
her an inward and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
eye, to see the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
riches and realities
of his counsells. So that
whereas the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see the wisedome of
God, and the precious
things contained in it, for
the mysterie; the Spouse
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14962:75"/>
by this new light, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
within the veile of<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 18, 19.</note>
the mysterie, shall see the
wisedome of God, and
most excellent treasures
contained in it, presented
and offered by it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore that God
in Christ may bee thy
Teacher, study this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
to God, which
by likenesse, by covenant,
by friendship, by marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-love,
may draw him
to teach thee: And first
put off the old man, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
with deceivable
lusts, which cause in thee
a deformitie, yea, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
against God. The
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14962:75"/>
uncircumcision of the
flesh hath in it a contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie
to God and his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and makes thee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
to Gods teaching,
and God unwilling to
teach thee. It is also a
veile upon the eye of thy
soule, &amp; hides thy sight
from his light, &amp; his light
from thy sight. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
a spirituall circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doe take off this veile,
thou art in the schoole of
the Prince of darknesse,
and art not yet teachable
by the Father of lights.
But if this veile of the
old man be first removed
by mortification, &amp; thou
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14962:76"/>
shalt in the second place
put on the new man,
wherein is the image of
God (light agreeable to
his light, and a love of him
who is Love, and of that
which hee loves) then
God will delight in thee,
as a father in the son that
resembles him; and as a
father his son, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to teach and nurture
thee. If thou keep this
image cleare, that God
may see his face in it, he
will therein also see his
covenant, and seeing his
covenant, hee will take
thee for his friend, yea,
for his spouse; and by all
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14962:76"/>
these, as by so many
cords of love, hee will be
drawne to teach thee.
Being thus pure in heart,
thou shalt see God: thou
shalt see him here guiding
and teaching thee, and
hereafter in presentiall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
eternally blessing
thee.</p>

for therein shalt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14962:78"/>
thou see Christ lively
set forth, and offering
his flesh, his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
yea himselfe, both
God and man, unto thee.
Such sights mayst thou
see in this great Schoole
of God, being enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and taught by his
Spirit, which Spirit is a
companion of the Word,
by the vertue of the New
Covenant; and by this
Covenant we may claime
and expect it from God.
Therefore is the New
Covenant called, The
Ministerie of the Spirit, in
an excellencie above the
Law, which was called,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14962:78"/>
The Ministerie of the
Letter. And it is such
indeed as it is called: for
while St. <hi>Peter</hi> taught the
word to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his
friends, the Spirit accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
the Word, and
fell on them that heard it.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> also calls up the
experience of the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
for a witnesse of
this truth;<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> Received yee
the Spirit by the works
of the Law, or by the
hearing of Faith prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched?
And indeed if
this truth thus covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God, and actually
made good by him, were
accordingly beleeved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14962:79"/>
on, thirsted after, and
expected, God should
bee more often heard
speaking spirit and life
with his Word, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
eare; and the Word
should not dye so often
in the outward eare, or
carnall heart for want of
this Spirit. It is an unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
losse, that men doe
so much divide the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Teacher from the
inward, &amp; rest on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
without respect to
the latter. Whereas when
wee goe to the outward
Teacher, which is man,
wee should set our eyes
and hearts chiefly on the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14962:79"/>
inward Teacher, which
is God: wee should chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
him upon his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and promise, saying
and praying; Remember
thy promise to thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
wherein thou hast
made him to hope. And
therefore speake Lord,
that thy servant may
heare; for without thy
speaking, thy servant
cannot heare. Hee may
heare the outward<note n="c" place="margin">Possunt quidem verba so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare, sed spiritum non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferunt: pulcherrimè dicunt, sed te tacente cor non accendunt.

of the Word in his eare:
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14962:80"/>
but he cannot heare the
inward sense and power
in his heart. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Israel had seene the
great wonders of God
upon Aegypt, they heard
the thunders on mount
Sinai;<note place="margin">Deut. 29. 1, 2, 3.</note> yet neither did
they see those wonders,
nor heare those thunders.
And <hi>Moses</hi> tells them
how it came to passe,
when hee saith; The
Lord hath not given you
eyes to see, and eares to
heare untill this day.
They thought their own
eyes sufficient to see,<note place="margin">Esa. 42. 19, 20.</note> and
their own eares to heare;
and resting in this insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14962:80"/>
sufficiencie, God
left them to it; and so
they did neither see nor
heare: for Gods works,
wonders, and voyce, can
onely kindly and truely
bee seene and heard, by
eyes and eares given of
God from Heaven.</p>
            <p>Know therefore thy
owne insufficiencie, yea,
the insufficiencie of the
best Teacher in the world
(for who is sufficient for
these things?) to teach
thee inwardly, what hee
teacheth thee outwardly;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16.</note>
and know that the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5, 6.</note>
of inward teaching
comes onely from God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:14962:81"/>
Therefore while thy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
eare expects the
outward word of the
outward Teacher, let
thy inward eare expect
the inward teaching of
the inward and highest
Teacher.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 6, 7.</note> For<note n="d" place="margin">Intuere quam cautè il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum de se humilia sentire moneat. Non ait, Ne fortè possis: sed quid? Ne fortè det illi Deus resipiscere; ut si quid fiat, ad Dominum cuncta referantur.

may the planting,
though of <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe;
and the watering, though
of <hi>Apollos,</hi> be made some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
even when God
gives an increase, which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14962:81"/>
otherwise are nothing.
And being thus inwardly
taught to profit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
thou art taught ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
for thou art
taught of God. Come
therefore diligently to
this schoole of his, where
hee useth thus to teach,
beleeve his Covenant, and
take it by beleeving.</p>
            <p>And secondly, That
thou mayest the better
beleeve and take it, hee
hath given thee seales of
the New Covenant, by
which the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is presented unto
thy faith, sealed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14962:82"/>
By this confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and sealing, thy
faith should be increased,
and by the increase of thy
faith, thy union with
Christ Jesus, the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
will bee increased;
and by the increase of
this Union there will bee
an increase of the Spirit
(the promise of the New
Covenant) which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the things of God,
and which will shew
them more unto thee, the
more it is in thee. When
thou wast baptized into
Christ, thou didst put on
Christ; and when thou
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14962:82"/>
eatest the spirituall meat,
and drinkest the spirituall
drinke in the Eucharist,
thou doest put him on
more and more. Thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Christ, even thy
new being, which thou
receivedst before, thou
doest now feed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
and bring forth into
manhood. And as thou
growest into manhood,
thou knowest by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
reason,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12, &amp;c.</note> thou art
enabled to grow in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to be more skilfull
in the word of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
better to discerne
good &amp; evill, &amp; to digest
the stronger meat of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14962:83"/>
mysteries. As wee
grow up in our stature in
Christ Jesus toward a
perfect man, we leave our
childish knowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 14.</note>
and grow up to him
in all things (&amp; therefore
in knowledge) which is
the head, even Christ.
The head is Wisedome it
selfe, and they that grow
in him growe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n wisdome,
and still take higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in the heavenly
Schoole, under this high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and most heavenly
Teacher.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, seeing God
teacheth thee by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and he is the Giver of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14962:83"/>
the Spirit, by which hee
teacheth thee; goe to
the Giver himselfe for
this gift. Goe to him by
prayer, and goe to him
publikely in the house of
prayer, and there joyne
with the Church in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
for the Spirit which
hee hath promised to his
Church. The uniting of
many hearts and voyces
in one petition, makes it
the stronger and more
powerfull with God.
And it may well be, that
when thou joynest with
the Congregation in
prayer, thou mayst joyne
with some, who shall not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14962:84"/>
only double the strength
of thy prayer, by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
strength of Spirit
added to thine, but by a
double portion of Spirit,
exceeding thine. And so
by this joyning of stocks
in publike prayer, thou
mayest bee a double gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
both while thou art
a partaker of many pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and while thou art
partaker of some more
powerful than thine own.
And indeed Christ would
not have spoken of two
or three gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his Name, except
there had beene some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and advantage in this
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14962:84"/>
gathering together, and in
two or three above one.
Therefore let us especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
expect him as hee
hath promised, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
where two or three
are gathered together.
Now wee know that
Christ is present with
his Church by his Spirit,
even that Comforter
which leadeth into all
truth.<note place="margin">Acts 4. 31.</note> And accordingly
wee find, that when the
Church was united in
prayer, they were filled
with the Holy Ghost.
And because Christ is
present with his Church
by this Spirit, to the end
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14962:85"/>
of the world, illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and teaching both
Pastours and people; our
Church prayeth for the
Pastours, That God
would illuminate them
with true understanding
and knowledge of his
Word: and for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
That God, who
taught the hearts of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
people, by the light
of the Holy Spirit, may
give us by the same Spirit,
to have a right judgement
in all things. Joyne then
with the Church, in the
offering up, and receiving
downe of such petitions;
and doe not by dividing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14962:85"/>
thy selfe from the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
divide thy selfe also
from the receiving. But
for so precious a gift as
the Spirit, make thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
as powerfull as thou
canst; and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
mayst thou make it,
if thou get more power
joyned together by a
Communion of Saints.</p>
            <p>Seeke God also by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
prayer for this gift
of the Spirit, which
Christ himselfe hath
taught, yea proved by
undeniable arguments,<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 13.</note>
that God will give to
them that aske it. And
the experimentall truth
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14962:86"/>
of this saying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
many excellent
Saints have found and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
professing
that they received some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by prayer more
light for the clearing of

and reading.<note n="e" place="margin">Oremus Dominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,—ut in Spiritu Sancto conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes quae per Spiritum scripta sunt, &amp; spiritalibus spiritalia comparantes, dignè Deo, &amp; Sancto Spiritui qui haec inspiravit quae scripta sunt, explice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. <hi>Orig. sup.

               </note> And
therefore wee shall find
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14962:86"/>
that the Fathers in their
Homilies and Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
doe often interrupt
their preaching with
praying; and in prayer
seeke to bee enabled by
the Spirit for preaching.<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 22.</note>
But come to God with
faith; for the promise
runs thus, That whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we aske beleeving, we
shall receive: Come also
with fervencie; for Christ
hath taught us,<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 8.</note> That what
friendship cannot doe, yet
importunitie may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:
And it hath beene
tried by the Canaanitish
woman, and many others
since her time, That
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14962:87"/>
where a denial will not be
taken for an answer, there
the answer hath been tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into grant. And the
more to encourage us to
importunitie, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of this grant of
the Spirit, let us take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
first, That God doth
chiefly like those prayers
that are made for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
God is a Spirit, and
as, because hee is a Spirit,
hee likes best that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and those prayers,
which are made by the
Spirit, so doth he highly
love those Prayers which
pray for the Spirit, by
which such agreeable and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14962:87"/>
acceptable prayers are
made. Secondly, God
hath abundance of Spirit,
and this abundance and
fulnesse of Spirit hath he
delivered over to his son
Christ Jesus, whose hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie
is <hi>Uber Deitatis,</hi>
The Brest of the Deitie.
And as wee all must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the fulnesse of
this Brest, so this Brest
being full, is most apt to
give, and therefore most
willing to meet with

doth stir, and blow away
the ashes, even earthly

God dwells by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and this Spirit being
sought to in this Temple
by the servants of God,
hath given them many
times divine answers and
resolutions. So hath this
little Temple beene tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

the soules of men enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened

That it is good for

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14962:91"/>
to asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by it to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
It is a good ambition,
because a spirituall one,
which desires to get up
to the highest Teacher,
who is also the highest
Spirit, and who alone tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
his Schollers to see
spirituall truths, with a
spirituall eye. Yea, hee
not onely makes the eye
to see spirituall things,
but gives to his Disciples
the excellent spirituall
things which they see:
And then also by giving
them to be tasted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
they are yet bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
knowne and seene,
even so seene as no man
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14962:92"/>

them to attaine a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and which is the

to see the Teacher

            <p>Strive therefore to get
up to this Heavenly Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie,
and as seriously as
thou intendest it, so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
use the meanes

thy selfe as thy own end,
much lesse that which is
inferiour to thee; neither
make base creatures the
end of thy selfe, and of
thy highest Creator, and
heavenly Teacher. Get
out also from thine owne
wisedome (a verie bad

wholly from it, unto that

may make a love and

to his Schoole, and
wheresoever thou hast
newes of his teaching,
there desire to meet him
with thy learning.
Though <hi>Martha</hi> bee

things, many businesses,
yea, many humane Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers;
yet with <hi>Marie</hi>
doe thou chuse the better
part, and desire to sit at
the feet of thy heavenly
Teacher. And if any
thing hinder thee for a
while (for sometimes the

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14962:93"/>
may deferre the dressing
of the root) yet returne
eftsoones to thy Teacher,
and meet him in some of
his Schooles. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
hinder thee, take
heed that it bee not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse
of thy Teacher,
nor a fulnesse of his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching;
for if thus thou
withdraw thy selfe from
him, thou wilt fall back in
thy learning, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
watered by the dew
of his teaching, thou wilt
grow drie in the root, and
therefore must needs wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and decay in thy
fruits.</p>
            <p>But that thou mayest
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14962:94"/>
not be mistaken, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the true heavenly

cautions. First, do not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
a teaching of thine
owne for an heavenly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching;
neither set thine
owne imagination in the
Celestiall Chaire. This
hath mis-led many into
many and great errours,
whiles being taught by
the strength of their own
imaginations, they have
thought themselves to be
taught of God. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
many times, as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
do thus come from
the strength of humane
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14962:94"/>
apprehension, so their
prosecution doth savour
of this strength, and
shewes from whence
they come; for too often
opinions are headily nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

as they were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
brought forth;<note place="margin">Jam. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

from above being first
pure, and then peaceable,<note place="margin">Vers. 17.</note>
such are they also, who
are kindly taught by that
wisdome. Wherefore to
trie thy teaching, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it bee of God, first
try whether it bee pure,

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               </gap>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:14962:96"/>
that is, agreeable to the
Word,<note place="margin">Psal. 12. 6.</note> which (the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
saith) is pure.<note place="margin">Esa. 8. 20.</note> For if
it agree not with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and frame of this
Word, there is no true
and kindly light in it.
Marke also and consider,
whether it doe not savour
of love, and agree with
that meeke and quiet spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which of God is much
esteemed.<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 9.</note> For the right
Disciples of God are
taught to love,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17, 18, 19.</note> and the
God of peace doth fill
them with the peace of
God.<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 23.</note> True it is,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 11.</note> that if
by the evident light of
the Word,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 16.</note> there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14962:96"/>
discovered that
beares the true shape of
the doctrine of the Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans,
and thou seest
that God hates it, this
mayest thou also hate:
but even the desire and
love of peace must not
goe out of thy heart; yea,
the love of peace must
manage thy warre with
errour, and even by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning
it, thou must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
peace and ensue it.
And still take heed that
thou doe not make little
errours great, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the wheat for the
tares, nor seeke to amend
lesser errours by a greater
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14962:97"/>
fault of schisme and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>Secondly judge right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of thy owne measure,
and measure thy selfe
rightly by it. And when
thou hast first measured
thy selfe aright, then also
measure thy actions and
undertakings by it. St.
<hi>Paul</hi> will have everie
man to keep in,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3.</note> and bound
his thoughts concerning
himself, by the measure of
faith given him of God.
Strive what thou canst to
increase thy measure, yet
use it as it is, and neither
thinke of thy abilitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
that which it is, nor
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14962:97"/>
thinke to produce effects
beyond the cause; which
is indeed to make some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
out of nothing.
Make use of that which
thou hast, which will not
onely increase the fruits
of thy gift, but increase
the gift it selfe, and turne
two talents into foure.
But if thou goest beyond
thy gift, in thy opinion of
it, thou goest from truth
into errour, from sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
into presumption and
pride. If thou goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
thy gift in thy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
thou goest beyond
strength to weaknesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
that which is, to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14962:98"/>
that which is not, and
doest not advance, but
lessen thy owne end. For
beyond thy sight thou
canst not see; neither canst
thou finish the house, for
the building whereof
thou hast not the costs.
In the meane time, if thou
have a willing mind, God
accepts thy doing out of
that which thou hast, and
expects it not out of that
which thou hast not.
And if thou bee faithfull
in that (though little)
which thou hast, God
will make thee Ruler o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
much. It hath beene
a fault in divers, though
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14962:98"/>
well-meaning soules,
sometimes to undertake
that which they are not
enabled to effect; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to condemne that
which they are not ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to comprehend; and
sometimes to approve
what they doe not attaine
and understand.<note place="margin">Job 42. 3.</note> I utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
saith <hi>Iob,</hi> that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
not, things too
wonderfull for me, which
I knew not: but <hi>Iob</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taught by God, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a remedie for this
disease, even a cure by
contraries; a cure of inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
speech, by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
silence.<note place="margin">Job 40. 5.</note> Once have
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14962:99"/>
I spoken, but I will not
answer: yea twice, but I
will proceed no further.
Therefore if something
bee revealed to a second,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 30.</note>
which was not to the
first, let the first hold his
peace. Silence is his first
part, who sees not what
he should say, and hearing
his second.<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15, 16.</note> Therefore
according to that which
wee have attained, let us
walke and speake; and
leave that to which wee
have not attained, to
those that have, untill
God shall reveale it. And
let those that have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
measure, help those
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14962:99"/>
that have the lesser, not
despising their lesser mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
because it is lesser;
but even therefore strive
to increase it.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 14.</note> For thus, in
some sort, that equalitie
of Manna may bee kept,
while the abundance of
one supplyes the want of
another, and the lesser
is filled up by the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And let the greater
know, that to whom
much is given, of him
much shall be required;
and if a man have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
five talents, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of gaine retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
is expressed to bee
five; and not two, as for
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14962:100"/>
two. And if thou hast
gained many, thou shalt
rule over many Cities.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, (as before of
the measure so now)
judge aright of the kind
of thy gift. True it is,
that all those that are
taught of God according
to the promise of the
New Covenant, are all
taught the Law of faith,
and the Law of love.
They shall all know me,<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 34.</note>
saith the Lord,<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 45, 47.</note> from the
greatest to the least;<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 2, 3.</note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
according to that
knowledge which is life
eternall. And this must
needs bee the knowledge
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14962:100"/>
of faith;<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 8. 1 Thess. 4. 9.</note> for by faith are
we saved, even that faith
which is the gift of God.<note place="margin">Joh. 13. 34, 35.</note>
The Disciples of God
are also taught to love
one another; and by this
love are they knowne to
be Disciples. And thus
by faith have they unitie
with the Head, and by
love with the Body. Yet
is it also true, that the
Spirit which gives the
light of faith, gives also
to divers of the Faithfull
divers other powers and
operations of light. To
one is given wisdome to
governe; to another,
judgement to decide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14962:101"/>
doubts, and
difficulties; to another,
a sharp sight of secrets
and mysteries. One ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
in contemplative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
another in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.
One knowes best
how to give advice, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowes better how
to obey and follow. Let
everie man therefore find
out his different abilitie
and excellencie, and with
his greatest abilitie let
him make his greatest
traffick. As everie man
hath received the gift, so
let him exercise and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence
it, as a good Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
of the manifold grace
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14962:101"/>
of God.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 10, 11.</note> The grace of
God is therefore divers
and manifold in many,
that in many his manifold
grace may more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; gloriously appeare;
and that each having need
of other,<note place="margin">Sermo divinus humanam naturam supergre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur, nec potest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; perfectu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anima concipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.

mutuall help from each
to other, as from the
members of one body.
Therefore if thou art a
foot, doe not strive to
doe the work of an hand,
but help the worke of an
hand, if thou mayest by
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14962:102"/>
the worke of a foot. For
a foot may indeed thus
have a part in the worke
of an hand, while in the
worke of a foot it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
and carries the hand
to the worke of an hand.
Bee then chiefly tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
which God would have
thee to be; and what by
his gift hee hath shewed
thee thou shouldest bee.
Keep thou especially in
thine owne line, neither
trouble thy selfe (much
lesse boast) for the line of
another. When Christ
speakes to thee to follow
him one way, thou maiest
not with <hi>Peter</hi> make
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14962:102"/>
quarrells and questions
concerning <hi>Iohns</hi> other
way; for so mayest thou
receive <hi>Peters</hi> answer
from the Master: What
is that to thee? follow
thou mee. It is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
part to allot the
way and worke of his
Disciples; and therefore
let both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>
walke that different way,
to which their Master
hath differently directed
them. A contrarie course
is a meere confusion, and
therefore agrees not with
him, who is the God of
order, and not of confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And as it brings all
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14962:103"/>
out of order, so it brings
all to nothing. For while
that gift is neglected, by
which some good may be
done, and that gift is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
by which (not being
attained) no good can be
done; Gods work is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
undone, or ill done.
Therefore use thine own
gift, according to the will
of the Giver, and so shall
it goe on in the right
way, to thy brothers
profit, thine owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and thy Lords
glorie.</p>
            <p>Lastly, for thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
teaching, and all
the knowledge taught by
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14962:103"/>
it, take no glorie to thy
selfe, but give it whole
and entire to thy heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Teacher. If flesh and
bloud have not taught
thee, but the Father in
Heaven, let not flesh and
bloud, but the Father in
Heaven, have all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of his owne teaching.
If thou hast nothing in
this kind, but what thou
hast received, and much
receiving causeth much
owing, how canst thou
glorie in the increase of
thy receits, except thou
wilt also glorie in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of thy debts? But
indeed the more thou hast
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14962:104"/>
received, the more thanks
and glorie shouldst thou
returne to the Giver. And
surely, God hath a plot
of glorie in the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his teaching. For
to make safe his glorie to
himselfe, hee often leaves
the wise and great of the
world to the blindnesse
of their naturall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and takes the mean
and despised ones of the
world, even babes, and
things that are not, and
gives them his teaching.
And this hee doth, That
no flesh may rejoyce in
his presence; but that all
glorying may be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14962:104"/>
from man, and kept
wholly for himselfe.
Then doe not thinke it
safe to rob God of his
glorie, which he hath thus
plotted and contrived.
Know that to rob God
of his glorie, is a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
kind of sacriledge:
And not so onely, but it is
also a highest kind of
ingratitude, to take from
God because he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to thee. Yea rather,
because hee hath beene
large in his grace to thee,
bee thou enlarged in thy
returne of thankes and
glorie to him. This plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
returne of glorie to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14962:105"/>
God, is the best way to
get an increase of that
grace, for which thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
him glorie. Yea, to
take all glorie from thy
selfe, and to give it to
God, is the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
true and solid glorie
from God. For God
will honour those that
honour him; and so shall
it bee a most gainfull
course for thee, while by
putting from thee a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
that belongs not to
thee, God will freely give
thee a glorie, that shall by
this gift truly belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee. And whereas
that would be but a false,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14962:105"/>
guiltie, and transitorie
glorie, which man would
give unto himselfe, this
shall be a pure, true, and
eternall glorie, which
shall bee given by God
unto man. Doe not
then make thy selfe vain,
and sinfull, and miserable,
by stealing glorie from
God to thy selfe;<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 12.</note> but
make thy selfe happie by
glorifying him, and being
glorified of him.</p>
            <p>Neither doe thou glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
him onely in words,
but in works; let it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the excellence of
thy works, that thou hast
had an excellent Teacher.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14962:106"/>
Let the light of thy
works so shine before
men, that they may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
God the Father of
this light. Christ tells
his Disciples, that by
bringing forth much
fruit his Father is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.
Let therefore
both the plentie and
the excellencie of thy
fruit, gaine glorie and
praise to the heavenly
Husbandman. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Christ our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
punctually and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
doth call for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
fruits of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples.
Hee thinks it not
enough for his glorie, if
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14962:106"/>
his Schollers, being
taught of God, bring
forth onely the fruits of
such as are taught by
men. Therefore hee rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them up to a higher
kind of fruitfulnesse, by
this question: What ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
thing doe yee?<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 47.</note>
He expecteth fruits of an
eminent vertue beyond
others, who beyond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have had an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
teaching and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.
Doe then some ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellent
things, yee that
have so excellent a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
and glorifie your
Master, by doing things
more excellent than the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14962:107"/>
meere Schollers of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Teachers. To this end,
let your fruits issue from
the new man, which is
taught of God; and not
from the old man, which
came in by the teaching
of Satan. Let the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
&amp; unmatchable oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Christ Jesus
give an excellent savour
to your works, and let
the house of the Church
be filled with the savour
of these oyntments. Let
the sweetnesse thereof so
ravish &amp; overcome men,
that they may bee forced
to confesse, That God is
in you of a truth, and that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14962:107"/>
you have beene taught of
God. And to this God,
which is in you, and hath
taught you to excell in
vertue, let them give all
the glorie.</p>
            <p>And thus after you
have a while advanced
the glorie of your Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
your Teacher shall
advance you into the
sight of his glorie. These
drops and dewes of grace,
by which you are now
taught, shall bring you to
the sight and fruition of
the Teacher himselfe,
who is an ever-flowing
Fountaine, and boundlesse
Ocean of light, wisdome,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14962:108"/>
grace &amp; glorie. Then the
most glorious Sun-light
and influence of Gods
presence, irradiating and
overflowing thee, and so
more than fully teaching
thee, shall drowne the
Star-light of this teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which thou recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedst
here below. Yet
shalt thou magnifie this
lesser teaching, because it
hath brought thee to this
great and glorious Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
whose light shall
give thee the sight of
the highest wisdome;
whose presence shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebriate
thee with the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of joy, whose right
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14962:108"/>
hand shall give thee the
pleasures of eternitie.
And in these eternall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
shalt thou eternally
glorifie thy supreme Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
who hath taught
thee to a Kingdome, and
that not an earthly, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and vanishing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but to a Kingdome
of Heaven that cannot be
shaken, a Kingdome of
blisse that hath no end, a
Kingdome wherein the
Righteous shall for ever
shine in the glorie of their
Father: for the Lord shall
be their everlasting light,
and their God their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
