            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="2">II. Where the Subtense of an Arch is A; let the Versed sine be V: (where<note place="margin">

               <p n="14">XIV. Because B, the Subtense of a double Arch, doth indifferently subtend the two Segments which compleat the whole Circumference; and, consequently, the half of either may be the single Arch of this double: It is therefore necessary that this Equation have two (Affirmative) Roots; the greater of which we will call A; and the lesser E: And therefore <gap reason="math">

               <p n="18">XVIII. <hi>In a Right-angled Triangle, the Square of the Hypothenuse</hi> (4Rq) <hi>is equal to the Squares of the sides containing the Right-angle.</hi> (Aq+Eq.)</p>

Hence therefore, <hi>The Radius</hi> (R) <hi>with the Subtense of an Arch</hi> (A or E) <hi>being given; we have thence the Subtense of the double Arch,</hi> B: (which is the <hi>Duplication of an Arch</hi> or <hi>Angle.</hi>) For, R, A, being given; we have <gap reason="math">

                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: And therefore 4Rq Aq − Aqq (= Rq Bq) = 4Rq Eq − Eqq. And the Roots of this Equation, <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Eq. And, the Quadratick Root of this, is A, or E.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. Hence also we have an easie <hi>Method, for a Geometrical Construction for</hi>

                  <hi>the Resolution of such Biquadratick Equations; or Quadratick Equations of a Plain Root, wherein the Highest Power is Negative.</hi> (Understand it in Mr. <hi>Oughtred's</hi> Language: Who puts the Absolute Quantity, Affirmative; and by it self; and the rest of the Equation all on the other side.) Suppose, Rq Bq = 4Rq Aq − Aqq, or (putting P = ½ B,) 4Rq Pq = 4Rq Aq − Aqq. For, dividing the Absolute term Rq Bq, or 4Rq Pq, by the Co-efficient of the middle term 4Rq, the Result is ¼Bq, or Pq; and its Root ½ B or P. Which being set Perpendicular on a Diameter equal to 2 R (the Square Root of that Co-efficient:) a streight Line from the top of it, Parallel to that Diameter, will (if the Equation be not impossible) cut the Circle, or at least touch it: From which Point of Section or Contact, two streight-lines drawn to the ends of the Diameter, are A, and E, the two Roots of that (ambiguous) Biquadratick Equation, (or, if we call it a Quadratick of a Plain-root, the Root of the Plain-root of such Quadratick Equation.)</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. And this Construction, is the same with the Resolution of this Problem; <hi>In a Right-angled Triangle, the Hypothenuse being given, and a Perpendicular from the Right-angle thereupon, to find the other sides;</hi> (and, if need be, the Angles, the Segments of the Hypothenuse, and the Area of the Triangle ½ R B or P R.)</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. Or thus: Having R and B, (as at § 22.) with the Radius R describe a Circle; and therein inscribe the Chord B; and another on the middle hereof at Right-angles: (which will therefore bisect that, and be a Diameter:) And, from both ends of this, to either end of B, draw the Lines A, E; as before.

And therefore (by § 13, 14, 15,) ZE+Aq (= ZA+Eq) = Tq = 3Rq = Aq+AE+Eq. And, consequently, ZE = AE+Eq, and ZA = Aq+AE; and therefore, Z = A+E. And therefore,</p>

               <p n="20">XX. But the same Chord Z, doth subtend, on the one side, to a Trient increased by the Arch A; and, on the other side, to a Trient increased by the Arch E; (as is evident;) That is, to an Arch which doth as much exceed a Trient (or want of two Trients,) as the Arch A or E wants of a Trient. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. <hi>The Aggregate of the Subtenses of two Arches, which together make up a Trient; is equal to the Subtense of another Arch which doth as much exceed a Trient, (or want of two Trients,) as either of those two wants of a Trient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">XXII. The same will in like manner be inferred, if we inscribe a Quadrilater<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fig.</hi> XI.</note> whose opposite sides are A, T, and E, T; and the Diagonals TZ. For then TA+TE = TZ; and therefore A+E = Z, as before.</p>
               <p n="23">
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97370:6"/>XXIII. But if either of the Arches to which Z subtendeth (greater than a<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fig.</hi> XI.</note> Trient, and less than two Trients) be Tripled; the Subtense of this Triple, is the same with that of the Triple of A or E. For the Triple of an Arch greater than a Trient, is equal to one whole Circumference with the Triple of that Excess. (For the Triple of ⅓+A, is 1+3A.) Now because, when we have once gone round the whole Circumference, we are just there where at first we began; this therefore (as to this Point) is as nothing; and the whole distance to be acquired is but the Triple of such Excess; and just the same as if onely this Excess had been thrice taken.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. As for Example: If the Arch subtended by Z, be β γ δ, (that is, a<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fig.</hi> XII.</note> Trient increased by the Arch E;) and to this we add a second equal to it, δ ζ θ; the Aggregate β γ δ ζ θ, is the double Arch, and the Subtense thereof is B, or β θ, (which is also the Subtense of the Difference of the Arches A, E:) and if to these two, we add a third equal to either of them θ γ χ; then is β γ δ ζ θ γ χ, the Triple of the Arch first proposed; and the Subtense hereof (that is, the Streight-line which joyns the beginning and the end of this Triple Arch) is β χ = C; the very same which subtends the Triple of E.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. And just the same would come to pass, if for the first Arch we take β θ ζ δ (that is, a Trient increased by A,) to which Z is a subtendent likewise. For, taking a second equal to it δ χ γ β θ; the Aggregate β θ ζ δ χ γ β θ (more than one entire Circumference) is the double Arch, and the Subtense thereof B as before: And if to these two we add a third equal to either, θ ζ δ χ; the Triple Arch is β θ ζ δ χ γ β θ ζ δ χ; and the Subtense hereof (as before) β χ or C; the same with the subtendent of the Triple of A. And therefore,</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. <hi>The Triple of an Arch greater than a Trient, hath the same Subtense with the Triple of its Excess above a Trient.</hi> And the same (for the same reason) holds in Arches greater than 2, 3, or more Trients.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. But note here, that, in this case; That is, if the Arch to be Tripled be greater than a Trient, but less than two Trients, (for if more than two Trients, but less than the whole Circumference, it is the same as if it were less than a Tri<gap reason="illegible" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap>;) the Subtense of the double is less than that of the single. For, in such case, the Arch will differ from that of a Semicircle (either in Excess or in Defect) by less than ⅙ of the whole Circumference. Let it be X.

For if the Arch A, or E, be to Degrees; B is 20; C, 30: If that be 20; B is 40; C, 60: If A be 40; B is 80; C, 120: If A be 60; B is 120; C, 180. (And hitherto is no doubt, because we are not yet past a Semicircumference; and, till then, as the Arches increase, the Chords increase also; though not when we are past 180 Degrees.) If A be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>0; B is 140 = 180 − 40; C, 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>0 = 180 + 30. So that yet the Chord of C, though past a Semicircumference, is greater than that of B, because nearer to a Semicircumference, or 180 Degrees; (for this doth less exceed it, than that wants of it.) And so 'till we come to 72 Degrees, (or 1/<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But when we be past a Quintant, that of the Triple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes less; for if the single Arch N = <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>/5 + E be 73; B is 146 = 180 − 34; C, 219 = 180 + 39; and this doth therefore more exceed 180, than the other comes short of it; and hath therefore the shorter Chord. So likewise, if N be 80; B is 160 = 180 − 20; C, 240 = 180 + 60: If N be 90, B is 180; C, 270 = 180 + 90: If N be 100; B is 200 = 180 + 20 = 360 − 160; C, 300 = 180 + 120 = 360 − 60: Where the Triple is farther from a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumference, as more exceeding it; and nearer to a whole Revolution (which is Equivalent to nothing) as approaching nearer to it; and therefore the Chord of the Triple, less than that of the double: So, if N, or L be 108; B is 216 = 180 + 36 = 360 − 144; C, 324 = 360 − 36 = 180 + 144. If L = ⅕ + A be 120; B is 243 = 180 + 60 = 360 − 120; C, 360. And therefore that B, the greater Chord: And so it will be 'till we come to 144 Degrees (or ⅖) when again they will become equal; for then B will be 288 = 180 + 108 = 360 − 72; and C = 432 = 360 + 72 = 540 − 108; which doth as much surpass a whole Revolution as the other wants of it; and doth as much want of a third Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumference as the other exceeds the first; and therefore their Chords become equal. But after this, the Chord of the Triple doth again become the greater: For if M the single Arch be 145; B will be 290 = 180 + 110 = 360 − 70; C, 435 = 360 + 75 = 540 − 105: If M be 150; B is 300 = 360 − 60; C, 450 = 360 + 90: If M be 180; B is 360; C, is 540 = 360 + 180: If M be 200; B is 400 = 360 + 40; C, 600 = 360 + 240; where the Arch C (as farther remote from an intire Revolution) requires the greater Chord. And so onward 'till we come to 216, (or ⅗) where the Chords of B and C do again become equal, for B will be 432 = 360 + 72; C, 648 = 720 − 72; where the Arch B doth as much exceed one Revolution, as C wants of two; and therefore require equal Chords. After this, the Arches L, N, from 216 to 288, have the same Chords with those of L, N, from 144 backward to 72, (as being their Complements to a whole Revolution,) and the same Chords of their Doubles and Triples, with the Doubles and Triples of those; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as there) the Chords of the Duple greater than those of the Triple. And from thence to 360 (which is an entire Revolution) the Chords are the same with those of A and E, (as being the Remainders of these to an intire Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and therefore here also, the Chord of the Triple is greater than that of the Duple.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Sextuplation, and Sextisection of an <hi>ARCH</hi> or <hi>ANGLE:</hi> And other following Multiplications and Sections.</head>
               <p n="1">I. ACCORDING to the same methods may be had, the Sextupla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Septuplation, and other consequent Multiplications; as also the Sextisection, Septisection, and other consequent Sections, of an Arch or Angle. Of which I shall briefly touch at some.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Sextuplation, may be had, by Tripling the Double, or Doubling the Triple Arch. And, accordingly, the Sextisection, by Bisecting the Subtriple, or Trisecting the Subduple. (as is of it self manifest.) And the same holds, in like manner, for Multiplications and Sections which take their Denomination from a Compound number. For Multiplications and Sections successively made, according to the Components of such Compound number, amount to the same as one by such Compound number.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But though <hi>Six</hi> were not a Compound number, or be not considered as such; yet may such Sextuplation and Sextisection be had in like manner as those before. Namely,</p>

                     <hi>Fig.</hi> XXXV.</note> Then is, DF−AB = CG; and C) DF−AB (G.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Or, Let the opposite sides be A, C, and B, G; the Diagonals C, F.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fig.</hi> XXXVI.</note> Then CF−AC = BG; and B) CF−AC (G.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. And therefore, Dq−Bq = CF−CA.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Or, Let the opposite sides be A, G, and A, D; the Diagonals B, F.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fig.</hi> XXXVII</note> Then BF−AD = AG; and A) BF−AD (G.</p>

               <p n="11">XI. And therefore, BF−AD = CD−BC.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. It is manifest that from hence may be deduced a great number of Equations, and Analogies, and great variety of Theorems, in like manner, as is done in the Chapters foregoing. But I forbear here to pursue them in particular as is there done.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:97370:26"/>XIII. But from every of those Constructions, (the values of B, C, D, F,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fig.</hi> XXXViii</note> being known as is above declared,) we have (by ordering the Equations in due manner,) <gap reason="math">

               <p n="14">XIV. That is, (dividing all by 4Rq−Aq,) RqqccGq = 36RqqccAq−105RqccAqq + 112RccAcc−54RqqAqcc + 12RqAqqcc−Acccc.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Of this Equation there be Six plain Roots, answering to Aq; the<note place="margin">

Which are so many streight Lines from some one Point of the Circumference, to the Six Angles of an inscribed regular Hexagon. (So that, any one of them being known, the rest are known also. And the like in all such Equations.)</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. Of these, the Two least, A, E, (which subtend, on the one side, to Arches less than a Sextant; and, on the other side to more than five Sextants;) And the Two greatest, x, y, (which subtend to Arches greater than two Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, but less than four;) are Affirmative Roots; (because the Subtendent of the double Arch is less than that of the Quadruple; and therefore Dq−Bq an Affirmative Quantity:) But the Two betwen them I, K, (which subtend on the one side, to Arches greater than one Sextant but less than two; and on the other side, to Arches greater than four Sextants but less than five;) are Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, (because of D less than B; and therefore Dq−Bq a Negative Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;) G being in all, reputed Affirmative.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. If a Chord be subtendent to just a Sextant, or two or more Sextants; it is indifferent to whether of the two cases on either side it be referred; suppose <gap reason="math">

               <p n="21">XXI. Of these Roots (putting H Affirmative,) the two least are Affirmative; the two next, are Negative; the two next to these, are again Affirmative; and, the greatest Negative.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. And after the same manner we may proceed as far as we please: Collecting the consequent Multiplications and Sections, by the help of those Antecedent.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. And all such as are denominated by a Compound number (as 4 = 2 × 2, 6 = 2 × 3, 8 = 2 × 4 = 2 × 2 × 2, 9 = 3 × 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) may, with more convenience, (at lest, as to the Section, if not as to the Multiplication also,) be performed by two or more operations, according to the Components of such Compound number.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. But, both these, and those which are Denominated from Prime numbers, (as 3, 5, 7, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) may (by such inscription of Quadrilaters) be Reduced to such Equations, as will contain as many Roots as is the number from which such Multiplication or Section takes its Denomination.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. And, of these, those which are Denominated by an <hi>Even</hi> number, will afford Equations having <hi>Plain</hi> Roots; the Square Root of which Plains, are the subtenses of the Arches.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. But those which are Denominated by <hi>Odd</hi> numbers, afford Equations whose Roots are those subtenses.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. And, of these subtenses (as well in the one case as in the other,) the two least (which I look upon as the Principal Roots of the Equation,) are Affirmatives (supposing the Subtense of the Multiple Arch to be always put Affirmative;) the two next greater than these, Negatives; the two next Affirmatives; and so onward, Alternately, as long as there be Roots remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: save that, when the number is Odd, the greatest of all will be singular, whereas the rest go by Couples.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Canon of Subtenses, and Sines; Of Tangents also and of Secants.</head>
               <p>FROM what is delivered in the foregoing Chapter; it is easie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct a Canon of Subtenses or Chords, in Surd Roots, to every Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halves of a Degree throughout the Semicircle. The halves of which Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses, are the Right-sines for every Three-quarters of a Degree throughout the Quadrant.</p>
               <p>(And thence, if need be, many Canons of Tangents and Secants, be deduced, in Surds Roots.)</p>
               <p>And hereby, any who please, may either make new Tables, in Numbers, (to what accuracy he please,) or examin those already made.</p>
               <p>For to every Subtense, to be successively sought, there will need but one extraction of the Square Root; (and, sometimes, not this;) the rest of the work being dispatched by only Addition and Subtraction; or, at most, Division also by 2 or 4.</p>
               <p>As, for Example: Supposing the Radius of a Circle R = 1. Then (because these, in the same Circle be all equal,) C = D = 1. And likewise Cq = Dq = CD = 1. And B will be the Subtense of the Angle proposed.</p>
               <p>Therefore, (by § 1.) the Square of the Subtense of 90 Degrees, Bq = Cq + Dq = 1 + 1 = 2. And the Subtense it self <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Which is had by one extraction of the Square Root of the number 2; continued in Decimal Parts to to what accuracy we please. Suppose <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>proximè.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, (by § 2.) the Square of the Subtense of 120 Degrees, is Bq = Cq + Dq + CD = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. And the Subtense it self <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Which is likewise had by one extraction of the Square Root of 3. Suppose <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> − <hi>proximè.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Square of the Subtense of 60 Degrees, is (by § 3.) Bq = Cq + Dq − CD = 1 + 1 − 1 = 1. And therefore the Subtense B = 1.</p>
               <p>The Square of the Subtense of 135 Degrees, is (by § 4.) <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Which is had by adding 2, to the value of <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> already found at § 1. That is, <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And so by one extraction of the Square Root of this number, we have the Subtense of 135 Degrees: Namely, <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>proximè.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So (by § 5.) the Square of the Subtense of 45 Degrees, is <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That is (by subtracting from 2 the value of <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> already found,) Bq = 0.58578643 ½ <hi>proximè.</hi> The Square Root of which, now to be extracted, is <gap reason="math">

               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:97370:32"/>And (by § 6.) the Square of the Subtense of 150 Degrees, is <gap reason="math">

                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

                  </gap>. As before,</p>
               <p>So (by § 7.) the Square of the Subtense of 30 Degrees, is <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (which is had by Subduction only, the value of <gap reason="math">

                  </gap> and <gap reason="math">

And, in like manner, we may proceed to design, by Surd Roots, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses of Arches as small as we please, by a continual Bisection of these Arches. The halves of which Subtenses, are the Right Sines of the Half-Arches.</p>
               <p>But, to design an intire Canon of Subtenses and Sines, answering to each single Degree, and the Sexagesims or first Minutes of such Degrees: Will (beside the extracting the Square Roots, of such Surds, in Numbers,) require also the Analysis (in Numbers) of Two Trisections, and of one Quinquisection of an Arch.</p>
               <p>For, the former process reaching no farther than to the Subtense of 1½ De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and consequently to the sine of ¾ of a Degree, or of Min. 45 = 3 × 3 × 5: We may thence, by a Trisection twice performed; and a Quinquisection once, proceed to the sine of 1 Minute. But not by Bisections only, or operations thence deduced.</p>
               <p>But, these operations being so (as is said) performed; the rest of the work is easily dispatched by help of § 9, 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. for finding the Subtense of the Sum or Difference of those Arches whose Subtenses are already known.</p>

If on the Diameter of a Circle D F, be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, at the Center C, an Angle B A D; the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Arch B D, is Proportional to the Angle. (by 26, 27. <hi>El.</hi> 3. and 33, <hi>El.</hi> 6, of <hi>Euclid.</hi>) That is, the Arch intercepted B D, is such a Part of the whole Circumference; as is the Angle A, of Four Right-angles. And accordingly the Angle A, is said to be, of so many Degrees, as is the Arch B D.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If B A, D A, the Legs containing such Angle, after a Decussation at C, forming the Vertical Angle E, be continued, on the other side, to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; the intercepted Arch G F, will, (by § 2.) be equal to B D, (because of the Vertical Angle E, equal to A:) And, consequently, the Aggregate of both B D + G F, is double to B D. That is, B D + G F = 2 B D.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. If at F the end of the Diameter, be formed a like Angle A; the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Arch H D, is likewise double to B D. That is, H D = B D + G F = 2 B D. Because (by 20. <hi>El.</hi> 3.) the Angle at the Center, is double to that at the Circumference, on the same Arch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:97370:35"/>Or thus, because (by Construction) F H, G C B, are Parallels: (as making equal Angles with F D:) Therefore, H B = F G = B D. And, consequently, H D = H B + B D = F G + B D = 2 B D. (By § 3.)</p>
               <p n="5">V. If at K, (any other Point of the Diameter within the Circle,) such Angle A be made, (with its Vertical E:) the Aggregate of the two Arches intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, F L + M D, is Double to B D. That is, F L + M D = F G + B D = 2 B D. For, (drawing the streight Line A M,) the two Internal Angles F M L + M F D, are equal to the External M K D = A = H F D (which is an Angle at the Circumference.) And therefore, the Arches opposite to those F L + M D, equal to the Arch opposite to this H D = 2 B D. (By § 4.)</p>
               <p>Or thus, because F H, L M, be Parallels (as making like Angles with F D,) therefore, F L = H M, and F L + M D = H M + M D = H D = 2 B D. (By § 4.)</p>
               <p n="6">VI. If at N, a Point of the Diameter produced, without the Circle; be formed a like Angle A; the Difference of the two intercepted Arches, Q D − P F, is equal to the same H D, or the Double of B D. For, P Q, F H, being Parallels, (as making like Angles with D F produced,) and therefore, P F = Q H: Therefore, Q D − P F = Q D − Q H = H D = 2 B D. (By § 4.)</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The same will hold, though neither of the Legs containing the Angle do pass through the Center, (and therefore lie not upon a Diameter;) as I shall now shew in the several Cases.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. If M L, μ λ, make M K μ an Angle at K any where, within the Circle, Let B c β be a like Angle at the Center, and the Legs of this Parallel to those of that. And, by the Angular Point K, draw the Diameter F K D. Then is (by § 5.) M D + L F = 2 B D: And μ D + λ F = 2 β D. Therefore, (the Sum or Difference) M μ (= M D ± μ D) + L λ (= L F ± λ F) = (2 B D ± 2 β D =) 2 B β.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="9">IX. In like manner: If H F η be an Angle at the Circumference: And, at the Center, B C β like to it, and with Legs Parallel to those: And F D a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter. Then (by § 4.) H D = 2 B D, and η D = 2 β D. Therefore, H η (= H D ± η D) = (2 B D ± 2 β D =) 2 B β.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:97370:36"/>X. The same is to be understood, in case one of the Legs touch the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at F, (the Points F, H, being in this case Co-incident; the Arch F H vanishing to nothing, and the Arch intercepted H η, the same with F η.) For here also, H F D = 2 B D, and η F D = 2 β D; and therefore, H F η (= H F D ± η F D) = (2 B D ± 2 β D =) 2 B β.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="11">XI. In like manner: If Q N χ be an Angle without the Circle, whose Legs cut it in P, π: And, at the Center, a like Angle and like sited B C: And N F D a Diameter produced. Then (by § 6.) Q D − P F = 2 B D, and χ D − π F = 2 β D. And therefore Q D ± χ D <hi>wanting</hi> P F ± π F, that is Q χ − P π, is equal to 2 B D ± 2 β D = 2 B β.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="12">XII. The same is to be understood, in case one or both of the Legs do not cut, but only touch the Circle. For then the Points P, Q; or π, χ; (or both,) being Co-incident; the rest proceeds as before. For still Q D − P F = 2 B D, and χ D − π F = 2 β D; and therefore, (the Sum or Difference) Q χ − P π = 2 B β.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="13">XIII. But in case one or both of the Legs pass by the Circle, and neither cut, nor so much as touch it: It doth not concern the present business; for such Angle doth not insist on a Circular Arch. The whole therefore (thus demonstrated) amounts to this General.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. <hi>If a Circle be cut</hi> (or at least touched) <hi>by two streight Lines, making an Angle:</hi> (and so, when continued, intersecting each other:) <hi>The Sum</hi> (if their intersection be within the Circle,) <hi>or Difference</hi> (if without,) <hi>of the two Arches intercepted by them</hi> (produced, if need be,) <hi>or</hi> (if their intersection be at the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference) <hi>the single Arch by them intercepted; is Double to the Arch of a like Angle at the Center.</hi>
