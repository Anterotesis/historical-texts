            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="2">II. Where the Subtense of an Arch is A; let the Versed sine be V: (where<note place="margin">

Suppose, Rq Bq = 4Rq Aq âˆ’ Aqq, or (putting P = Â½ B,) 4Rq Pq = 4Rq Aq âˆ’ Aqq.

For the Triple of an Arch greater than a Trient, is equal to one whole Circumference with the Triple of that Excess. (For the Triple of â…“+A, is 1+3A.) Now because, when we have once gone round the whole Circumference, we are just there where at first we began; this therefore (as to this Point) is as nothing; and the whole distance to be acquired is but the Triple of such Excess; and just the same as if onely this Excess had been thrice taken.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. As for Example: If the Arch subtended by Z, be Î² Î³ Î´, (that is, a<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fig.</hi> XII.</note> Trient increased by the Arch E;) and to this we add a second equal to it, Î´ Î¶ Î¸; the Aggregate Î² Î³ Î´ Î¶ Î¸, is the double Arch, and the Subtense thereof is B, or Î² Î¸, (which is also the Subtense of the Difference of the Arches A, E:) and if to these two, we add a third equal to either of them Î¸ Î³ Ï‡; then is Î² Î³ Î´ Î¶ Î¸ Î³ Ï‡, the Triple of the Arch first proposed; and the Subtense hereof (that is, the Streight-line which joyns the beginning and the end of this Triple Arch) is Î² Ï‡ = C; the very same which subtends the Triple of E.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. And just the same would come to pass, if for the first Arch we take Î² Î¸ Î¶ Î´ (that is, a Trient increased by A,) to which Z is a subtendent likewise.

(And hitherto is no doubt, because we are not yet past a Semicircumference; and, till then, as the Arches increase, the Chords increase also; though not when we are past 180 Degrees.) If A be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

So that yet the Chord of C, though past a Semicircumference, is greater than that of B, because nearer to a Semicircumference, or 180 Degrees; (for this doth less exceed it, than that wants of it.) And so 'till we come to 72 Degrees, (or 1/<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of the whole) for then B is 144 = 180 âˆ’ 36, and C, 216 = 180 + 36; where the distance is equal, and accordingly the Chord of the Triple equal to that of the double. But when we be past a Quintant, that of the Triple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes less; for if the single Arch N = <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

So likewise, if N be 80; B is 160 = 180 âˆ’ 20; C, 240 = 180 + 60: If N be 90, B is 180; C, 270 = 180 + 90: If N be 100; B is 200 = 180 + 20 = 360 âˆ’ 160; C, 300 = 180 + 120 = 360 âˆ’ 60: Where the Triple is farther from a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumference, as more exceeding it; and nearer to a whole Revolution (which is Equivalent to nothing) as approaching nearer to it; and therefore the Chord of the Triple, less than that of the double: So, if N, or L be 108; B is 216 = 180 + 36 = 360 âˆ’ 144; C, 324 = 360 âˆ’ 36 = 180 + 144. If L = â…• + A be 120; B is 243 = 180 + 60 = 360 âˆ’ 120; C, 360. And therefore that B, the greater Chord: And so it will be 'till we come to 144 Degrees (or â…–) when again they will become equal; for then B will be 288 = 180 + 108 = 360 âˆ’ 72; and C = 432 = 360 + 72 = 540 âˆ’ 108; which doth as much surpass a whole Revolution as the other wants of it; and doth as much want of a third Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumference as the other exceeds the first; and therefore their Chords become equal. But after this, the Chord of the Triple doth again become the greater: For if M the single Arch be 145; B will be 290 = 180 + 110 = 360 âˆ’ 70; C, 435 = 360 + 75 = 540 âˆ’ 105: If M be 150; B is 300 = 360 âˆ’ 60; C, 450 = 360 + 90: If M be 180; B is 360; C, is 540 = 360 + 180: If M be 200; B is 400 = 360 + 40; C, 600 = 360 + 240; where the Arch C (as farther remote from an intire Revolution) requires the greater Chord. And so onward 'till we come to 216, (or â…—) where the Chords of B and C do again become equal, for B will be 432 = 360 + 72; C, 648 = 720 âˆ’ 72; where the Arch B doth as much exceed one Revolution, as C wants of two; and therefore require equal Chords. After this, the Arches L, N, from 216 to 288, have the same Chords with those of L, N, from 144 backward to 72, (as being their Complements to a whole Revolution,) and the same Chords of their Doubles and Triples, with the Doubles and Triples of those; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as there) the Chords of the Duple greater than those of the Triple. And from thence to 360 (which is an entire Revolution) the Chords are the same with those of A and E, (as being the Remainders of these to an intire Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and therefore here also, the Chord of the Triple is greater than that of the Duple.</p>

               <p n="1">I. ACCORDING to the same methods may be had, the Sextupla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Septuplation, and other consequent Multiplications; as also the Sextisection, Septisection, and other consequent Sections, of an Arch or Angle. Of which I shall briefly touch at some.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Sextuplation, may be had, by Tripling the Double, or Doubling the Triple Arch. And, accordingly, the Sextisection, by Bisecting the Subtriple, or Trisecting the Subduple. (as is of it self manifest.) And the same holds, in like manner, for Multiplications and Sections which take their Denomination from a Compound number. For Multiplications and Sections successively made, according to the Components of such Compound number, amount to the same as one by such Compound number.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But though <hi>Six</hi> were not a Compound number, or be not considered as such; yet may such Sextuplation and Sextisection be had in like manner as those before. Namely,</p>

               <p n="16">XVI. Of these, the Two least, A, E, (which subtend, on the one side, to Arches less than a Sextant; and, on the other side to more than five Sextants;) And the Two greatest, x, y, (which subtend to Arches greater than two Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, but less than four;) are Affirmative Roots; (because the Subtendent of the double Arch is less than that of the Quadruple; and therefore Dqâˆ’Bq an Affirmative Quantity:) But the Two betwen them I, K, (which subtend on the one side, to Arches greater than one Sextant but less than two; and on the other side, to Arches greater than four Sextants but less than five;) are Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, (because of D less than B; and therefore Dqâˆ’Bq a Negative Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;) G being in all, reputed Affirmative.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Canon of Subtenses, and Sines; Of Tangents also and of Secants.</head>
               <p>FROM what is delivered in the foregoing Chapter; it is easie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct a Canon of Subtenses or Chords, in Surd Roots, to every Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halves of a Degree throughout the Semicircle. The halves of which Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses, are the Right-sines for every Three-quarters of a Degree throughout the Quadrant.</p>
               <p>(And thence, if need be, many Canons of Tangents and Secants, be deduced, in Surds Roots.)</p>
               <p>And hereby, any who please, may either make new Tables, in Numbers, (to what accuracy he please,) or examin those already made.</p>
               <p>For to every Subtense, to be successively sought, there will need but one extraction of the Square Root; (and, sometimes, not this;) the rest of the work being dispatched by only Addition and Subtraction; or, at most, Division also by 2 or 4.</p>
               <p>As, for Example: Supposing the Radius of a Circle R = 1. Then (because these, in the same Circle be all equal,) C = D = 1. And likewise Cq = Dq = CD = 1. And B will be the Subtense of the Angle proposed.</p>
               <p>Therefore, (by Â§ 1.) the Square of the Subtense of 90 Degrees, Bq = Cq + Dq = 1 + 1 = 2. And the Subtense it self <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ math ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>: Which is had by one extraction of the Square Root of the number 2; continued in Decimal Parts to to what accuracy we please. Suppose <gap reason="math">

               </p>
               <p>Again, (by Â§ 2.) the Square of the Subtense of 120 Degrees, is Bq = Cq + Dq + CD = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. And the Subtense it self <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ math ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>: Which is likewise had by one extraction of the Square Root of 3. Suppose <gap reason="math">

               </p>
               <p>The Square of the Subtense of 60 Degrees, is (by Â§ 3.) Bq = Cq + Dq âˆ’ CD = 1 + 1 âˆ’ 1 = 1. And therefore the Subtense B = 1.</p>
               <p>The Square of the Subtense of 135 Degrees, is (by Â§ 4.) <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ math ã€‰</desc>

                     <desc>ã€ˆ math ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>. And so by one extraction of the Square Root of this number, we have the Subtense of 135 Degrees: Namely, <gap reason="math">

And, in like manner, we may proceed to design, by Surd Roots, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses of Arches as small as we please, by a continual Bisection of these Arches. The halves of which Subtenses, are the Right Sines of the Half-Arches.</p>
               <p>But, to design an intire Canon of Subtenses and Sines, answering to each single Degree, and the Sexagesims or first Minutes of such Degrees: Will (beside the extracting the Square Roots, of such Surds, in Numbers,) require also the Analysis (in Numbers) of Two Trisections, and of one Quinquisection of an Arch.</p>
               <p>For, the former process reaching no farther than to the Subtense of 1Â½ De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and consequently to the sine of Â¾ of a Degree, or of Min. 45 = 3 Ã— 3 Ã— 5: We may thence, by a Trisection twice performed; and a Quinquisection once, proceed to the sine of 1 Minute. But not by Bisections only, or operations thence deduced.</p>
               <p>But, these operations being so (as is said) performed; the rest of the work is easily dispatched by help of Â§ 9, 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. for finding the Subtense of the Sum or Difference of those Arches whose Subtenses are already known.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of Angles compared with they Arches on which the stand.</head>
               <p n="1">I. THAT <hi>The Angle of a Sector, is proportional to the Arch on which it doth insist; whether such Angle be at the Center, or at the Circumference:</hi> And, that <hi>such Angle at the Center, is double to that at the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:</hi> Is shewed by <hi>Euclide</hi> long since; and is generally known. But not so, in case such Angle be any where else, whether within or without the Circle. It will therefore be not amiss, to pursue that Notion a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as here followeth.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="2">II. If on the Diameter of a Circle D F, be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, at the Center C, an Angle B A D; the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Arch B D, is Proportional to the Angle. (by 26, 27. <hi>El.</hi> 3. and 33, <hi>El.</hi> 6, of <hi>Euclid.</hi>) That is, the Arch intercepted B D, is such a Part of the whole Circumference; as is the Angle A, of Four Right-angles. And accordingly the Angle A, is said to be, of so many Degrees, as is the Arch B D.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If B A, D A, the Legs containing such Angle, after a Decussation at C, forming the Vertical Angle E, be continued, on the other side, to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; the intercepted Arch G F, will, (by Â§ 2.) be equal to B D, (because of the Vertical Angle E, equal to A:) And, consequently, the Aggregate of both B D + G F, is double to B D. That is, B D + G F = 2 B D.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. If at F the end of the Diameter, be formed a like Angle A; the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Arch H D, is likewise double to B D. That is, H D = B D + G F = 2 B D. Because (by 20. <hi>El.</hi> 3.) the Angle at the Center, is double to that at the Circumference, on the same Arch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:97370:35"/>Or thus, because (by Construction) F H, G C B, are Parallels: (as making equal Angles with F D:) Therefore, H B = F G = B D. And, consequently, H D = H B + B D = F G + B D = 2 B D. (By Â§ 3.)</p>
               <p n="5">V. If at K, (any other Point of the Diameter within the Circle,) such Angle A be made, (with its Vertical E:) the Aggregate of the two Arches intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, F L + M D, is Double to B D. That is, F L + M D = F G + B D = 2 B D. For, (drawing the streight Line A M,) the two Internal Angles F M L + M F D, are equal to the External M K D = A = H F D (which is an Angle at the Circumference.) And therefore, the Arches opposite to those F L + M D, equal to the Arch opposite to this H D = 2 B D. (By Â§ 4.)</p>
               <p>Or thus, because F H, L M, be Parallels (as making like Angles with F D,) therefore, F L = H M, and F L + M D = H M + M D = H D = 2 B D. (By Â§ 4.)</p>
               <p n="6">VI. If at N, a Point of the Diameter produced, without the Circle; be formed a like Angle A; the Difference of the two intercepted Arches, Q D âˆ’ P F, is equal to the same H D, or the Double of B D. For, P Q, F H, being Parallels, (as making like Angles with D F produced,) and therefore, P F = Q H: Therefore, Q D âˆ’ P F = Q D âˆ’ Q H = H D = 2 B D. (By Â§ 4.)</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The same will hold, though neither of the Legs containing the Angle do pass through the Center, (and therefore lie not upon a Diameter;) as I shall now shew in the several Cases.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. If M L, Î¼ Î», make M K Î¼ an Angle at K any where, within the Circle, Let B c Î² be a like Angle at the Center, and the Legs of this Parallel to those of that. And, by the Angular Point K, draw the Diameter F K D. Then is (by Â§ 5.) M D + L F = 2 B D: And Î¼ D + Î» F = 2 Î² D. Therefore, (the Sum or Difference) M Î¼ (= M D Â± Î¼ D) + L Î» (= L F Â± Î» F) = (2 B D Â± 2 Î² D =) 2 B Î².</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="9">IX. In like manner: If H F Î· be an Angle at the Circumference: And, at the Center, B C Î² like to it, and with Legs Parallel to those: And F D a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter. Then (by Â§ 4.) H D = 2 B D, and Î· D = 2 Î² D. Therefore, H Î· (= H D Â± Î· D) = (2 B D Â± 2 Î² D =) 2 B Î².</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:97370:36"/>X. The same is to be understood, in case one of the Legs touch the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at F, (the Points F, H, being in this case Co-incident; the Arch F H vanishing to nothing, and the Arch intercepted H Î·, the same with F Î·.) For here also, H F D = 2 B D, and Î· F D = 2 Î² D; and therefore, H F Î· (= H F D Â± Î· F D) = (2 B D Â± 2 Î² D =) 2 B Î².</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="11">XI. In like manner: If Q N Ï‡ be an Angle without the Circle, whose Legs cut it in P, Ï€: And, at the Center, a like Angle and like sited B C: And N F D a Diameter produced. Then (by Â§ 6.) Q D âˆ’ P F = 2 B D, and Ï‡ D âˆ’ Ï€ F = 2 Î² D. And therefore Q D Â± Ï‡ D <hi>wanting</hi> P F Â± Ï€ F, that is Q Ï‡ âˆ’ P Ï€, is equal to 2 B D Â± 2 Î² D = 2 B Î².</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="12">XII. The same is to be understood, in case one or both of the Legs do not cut, but only touch the Circle. For then the Points P, Q; or Ï€, Ï‡; (or both,) being Co-incident; the rest proceeds as before. For still Q D âˆ’ P F = 2 B D, and Ï‡ D âˆ’ Ï€ F = 2 Î² D; and therefore, (the Sum or Difference) Q Ï‡ âˆ’ P Ï€ = 2 B Î².</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="13">XIII. But in case one or both of the Legs pass by the Circle, and neither cut, nor so much as touch it: It doth not concern the present business; for such Angle doth not insist on a Circular Arch. The whole therefore (thus demonstrated) amounts to this General.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. <hi>If a Circle be cut</hi> (or at least touched) <hi>by two streight Lines, making an Angle:</hi> (and so, when continued, intersecting each other:) <hi>The Sum</hi> (if their intersection be within the Circle,) <hi>or Difference</hi> (if without,) <hi>of the two Arches intercepted by them</hi> (produced, if need be,) <hi>or</hi> (if their intersection be at the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference) <hi>the single Arch by them intercepted; is Double to the Arch of a like Angle at the Center.</hi>
