         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Moſt Honourable and moſt Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough I had not the happineſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
to have an acquaintance with
you; yet I was no ſtranger to your
Worth and Virtue, which have made
you as much admired and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
abroad as honoured and beloved at home:
And therefore I have aſſumed the confidence to
make this Addreſs to your Honour, whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
and Teſtimony to the World will be ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
(knowing your Wiſdom, Devotion, and
Learning to be ſo great) that Truth may find be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
God have Glory, and his poor Inſtrument
be juſtified before Men, who hath no farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in the diſtribution of that Talent which the
All-healing God has entruſted him withal, then
the honour of his Maker, and the good of his
poor Fellow-creatures, whoſe Diſtempers (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them) neither Art nor Phyſick probably
could reach; which cauſed him cheerfully (that
he might not be found an unfaithful Steward) to
caſt all his worldly pleaſures and delights behind
his back, to run himſelf into the midſt of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes,
to make his houſe an Hoſpital, and forſake
his own intereſt and advantages; to labour day
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54889:3"/>
and night, and oftentimes run the hazard of his
liberty and life by the crowds, preſſings, ſteams
and ſtinks of the multitudes and ulcerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
(which you can well witneſs few men can
brook or undergo) and what is worſe then all
this, the ſcandalous and falſe Reports of lying
Tongues; which have cauſed him who never had
the Ambition to publiſh himſelf to the World
farther then by his deeds, to write this Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in anſwer to a Pamphlet called by the Title
of <hi>[Wonders no Miracles]</hi> wherein the Author a
certain obſcure Perſon, one that never ſaw me
nor knew any thing of me, very confidently takes
upon him to be my Herald and Confeſſor, and to
repreſent me in ſuch black Characters, as if I
were ſo horrid a Monſter that my very Name
ſhould affright the Reader.</p>
            <p>Sir, I never injured this Gentleman in Word
or Deed in all my life, and yet he who pretends
himſelf to be a Miniſter of the Goſpel is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
(beyond the Rules of Charity) invective
againſt me. But (you know, Sir) if to be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
only be ſufficient, who can be found inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent?
I have enough of provocations given me
to reflect, but God be praiſed I have learn'd a
better Leſſon, and ſhall return him good for evil,
if it lies in my power.</p>
            <p>I beſeech God I may never ſuffer as a Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
or as a Thief, or as an Evil-doer, or as a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie-man
in other mens matters; but if I ſuffer for
doing good to perſons in miſery freely, I hope I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54889:3"/>
have no cauſe to be aſhamed, but to glorifie God
on this behalf, who gave both the gift and mind
to uſe it.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman was the man (as I am certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
informed) that writ that Pamphlet Entituled
<hi>The Counteſs of</hi> Bridgwaters <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> for which he
lay ſix months in Priſon; one would have thought
this might have proved a ſufficient warning to him
to be more ſober for the future, who you may ſee
was aſhamed to fix his Name to his Book, leſt the
Contents thereof (though it might carry ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of Truth in it) might totally be diſcredited
for the Authors ſake. I do not inſtance in this
Gentleman to ſhame him (for that is no ways my
deſign) but ſo far to invalidate his Teſtimony,
that I may not be the worſe thought of for his
evil ſpeaking, who makes it his Trade to put forth
Libels on any one, ſo he may get but a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from the Printer, or thoſe that employ him.
I pray God he may better make uſe of his Time
and Parts hereafter, and that he would take all
rancour and malice out of his heart, and give
him the Spirit of Meekneſs, Charity, and Love:
for if we bite and devour one another, we may
chance to be conſumed one of another.</p>
            <p>For me to anſwer each particular Allegation of
his, would require too much time to be ſo ill
ſpent, and therefore I will over-look his calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
deſiring God to forgive him; nor ſhall I
render evil for evil, or railing for railing, only I
ſhall inſtance in ſome few particulars for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54889:4"/>
of the Reader, who by thoſe as by a
Touch-ſtone may try what mettal the reſt are
made of. And,</p>
            <p>Firſt. In <hi>folio</hi> 14. he charges me to have writ
to that Right Reverend and Pious Perſon the
Lord Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> with ſeveral other Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which I ſhall make uſe of, which are moſt, if
not every one of them, feigned and falſe. The
words are as follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he had a voice from Heaven aſsuring him
firſt, That he had a Power to cure the Kings-Evil,
and afterwards that he might cure all Diſeaſes:
That he could not be quiet till he had undertaken it;
and that a Woman unknown to him had a Viſion to
come to him; and that hereupon (notwithſtanding
he was diſwaded by his Friends from the Practice,
and jeered out of the Imagination) he had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Impulſe to force him upon the ſeveral Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he had made, till the whole Country thronged
to him.</hi> And this the Pamphleteer ſaith is what
the Man ſaith for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now by this Teſtimonial of my Lord Biſhop
of <hi>Chester</hi> written with his own hand at his Houſe
in <hi>Tuthill-ſtreet</hi> (which I herewith ſend you) you
may pleaſe to judge how miſbecoming his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a Clergy-man he has acquitted himſelf in
fathering ſuch forgeries upon one of the Fathers
of the Church, whoſe Teſtimony he would have
made uſe of to create a belief in the Reader, and
ſcandalize an innocent perſon. The words are as
follow.</p>

to ſhew you the diſ-ingenuity of this Perſon, I
went to him who was reported the Author of that
Pamphlet, with Dr. <hi>Whitchcot,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi>
(my honoured Friends, who were pleas'd to afford
me the favour of their Company) and reaſon'd
with the Gentleman about ſeveral Things he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me with being guilty of in his Book, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
before them to know whether he knew me,
that he gave ſuch a Character of me; or whether
this practiſe of his, in ſlandering of a Stranger, and
an innocent perſon for ought he knew, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the rule of the Goſpel, or that of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Honeſty? And alſo I told him that his carriage
in this Affair could not but ſubject him to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of wiſe men, who would lie inveying in his
Cloſet, by judging and condemning what he knew
not, and denying the verity of what was obvious
to all perſons that had the curioſity of coming;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54889:6"/>
when as he might purchaſe the knowledge of truth
by an occular Teſtimony, in repairing to the houſe
which I frequented in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-fields,</hi> where
I promiſed to make way for him, and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
him with a convenient place, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(when he had informed himſelf) he might
be able to relate the truth of things to others,
ſince he had ſuch an itching deſire to Write: At
length the honeſt Gent. promiſed that he would
come, but never did; fearing that by the glaſs of
truth there, he might diſcover the deformity of
his carriage and be forced to a recantation. But
to proceed further,</p>
            <p>In Page 20. he uſeth theſe words: <hi>He takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in publick himſelf, but it hath coſt ſome good
round ſums of money to his Followers, who are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to be noted Projectors; <hi>Jo. Terrill</hi> Gent. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
100 l. to come at him, <hi>James Birion</hi> 40 l.
and <hi>William Fettyplace</hi> 60 l. &amp;c.</hi> To this I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
            <p>That he ſpeaks Truth in ſaying that I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Publick, but in ſaying, That it hath coſt
ſome good round ſums of money to his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
who are obſerved to be noted Projectors, he
ſays an unhandſome untruth known to many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands;
for I never ſuffered, nor would keep any
Servant that I knew would take a farthing of
any one that comes to me: Nor have I any Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
but a ſimple Youth whom I never ſuffered
to be a Door-keeper to avoid ſcandal. And as
for <hi>Jo Terrill, Ja. Birion,</hi> and <hi>William Fettyplace</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:54889:6"/>
(I ſay) I know them not by their Names, nor did I
ever hear of them but in his Book, who is their
Godfather I believe.</p>
            <p>Then in the ſame page he ſaith, I borrow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of my Patients though I take none; in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to which, I call God of Heaven to witneſs, I
never borrowed ſo much as one farthing (to the
beſt of my remembrance) in my life, nor does
he inſtance in one, nor can any man living.</p>
            <p>Then in the ſame page you may further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
how like a Deceiver he ſpeaks: <hi>What if it
be proved that ſuch as he have thoſe that maintain
them and hire them Patients:</hi> and in the 21 page
he chargeth me in theſe Terms; <hi>And the dulleſt
noſe may ſmell the matter when he heareth this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of him: That being a Member of an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Church, He was excommunicated thence
for pretending to the gift of Heaven, and thereupon
his Gift left him, untill being abſolved he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admitted
at once to his Church-priviledge and his
gift.</hi> To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p>That I never was a Member of an <hi>Independent</hi>
Church in my life, and ſo could not be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
by them, neither do I acknowledge any
ſuch Power in ſuch a Church.</p>
            <p>But paſſing by many of his Invectives, which
his own conſcience (if he has any) cannot but
ſmite him for, being guilty of ſo many ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and ſimple untruths, I come to that of the
22. page, where he ſays: <hi>That its evident that this
whole Affair is but a Cheat, and that there is not a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54889:7"/>
Man, Woman, or Child that may be truſted and are
well known that is the better for him.</hi> Which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
your Honour I am ſure, as well as thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
elſe, knows to be otherwiſe; and therefore
I think it needleſs to ſay any thing more to this
particular, than to refer the Reader to the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
Teſtimonials following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then in Page 23. (on which ſingle Inſtance
this Architect builds ſo large a Structure) he ſays;</hi>
I Launced a poor man troubled with a ſore Knee
in the Charter-Houſe, and that I pinched the poor
man, and the ſore Gangrened, and that if it had not
been for the worthy Doctor <hi>Bevior</hi> Phyſitian to that
Houſe, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Harriſon</hi> the Chirurgeon, there had
been Life and Limb loſt; and that when I heard of
this, I came to the man and would have been tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him, but the man would not endure me,
charging me with his Blood if he had dyed, and
wiſhing me no more to delude the People. <hi>To which
I make this anſwer:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That true it is, on the requeſt of a poor man
that came to me in the <hi>Charter-houſe,</hi> I made a ſmall
inciſion a little above the pan of his Knee (as I take
it) which was full of ſmall concreted Juices like
Meaſles; and it may be, as it is uſual (where there
is any humour) that the Place where the Orifice
was, did ſwell, grow red, and fiery, as it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
before the Tumour comes to a ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(which in laying my hands of it, and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereon would, as it is uſual, immediately have
ceaſed) but that it came to a Gangreen, or that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54889:7"/>
the Doctor or Chirurgeon without diſſecting the
Limb ſo affected cured him afterwards, carries ſo
ſo great an improbability in it, that any ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſon cannot but abhor his Malice and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
herein: and whether the latter part of his
charge be true I refer you to the teſtimony of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Creſſet</hi> herein, who was the only perſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
when I went to the poor man: which I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

conceive my ſelf in conſcience bound to leave a
Teſtimony of Truth behind me before I turn my
face homewards; and therefore I ſhall give your
Honour and the World a brief and true Narrative
of my ſelf from my Birth to this inſtant, and
thoſe wonderfull things which God has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in mercy to effect upon ſeveral perſons by my
hand.</p>
            <p>I was born the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>February</hi> 1628. I
was the Son of <hi>William Greatrak's</hi> of <hi>Affane</hi> in the
County of <hi>Waterford,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one that had liberal
Education, and a competent Eſtate left him by his
Father (who was known to be a worthy Perſon
and well eſteemed in his Country) a man lookt
upon to be of a generous ſpirit, but one that had
a mind above his fortune. My Mother was the
Daughter of Sir <hi>Edward Harris</hi> Knight, one of
his late Majeſties Juſtices of the Kings Bench in
the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who had the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a learned and a juſt Judge; and this I dare
ſay of her, (who dyed ſome few years paſt) for I
do but juſtice to her memory) ſhe was a virtuous
and diſcreet Woman, an excellent Neighbour,
and a moſt indulgent and provident Parent; ſhe
took a care of my Education (my Father dying
when I was tender in years) which was briefly as
follows.</p>
            <p>Firſt, After I had learn'd to read, I was ſent to
the Free-School of <hi>Liſmore</hi> (once famous) which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54889:9"/>
was erected by the Charity of your Father the
late Earl of <hi>Cork,</hi> where I ſpent my time till I
was 13 years of age, and had made ſuch a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
in Learning, that I was deſigned for the
Colledge the enſuing year, but prevented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
by the late Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whence
I was forced with my Mother and ſeveral other
ſmall Children to flye for refuge hither into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and by the Charity of my Uncle Mr. <hi>Edm.
Harris</hi> were relieved and provided for, and had
the Principles of Religion confirmed in me by
him, who was a Proteſtant, and one of ſo ſevere
a pious life, that he devoted his whole time to
the Service of God and the works of Charity:
He was one that in many years before his death
was not known to ſpeak an idle word, or ſpend a
vain hour: In brief, he was a Saint in his life and
converſation, and one whoſe memory I ſhall ever
reverence and love; but God in mercy to him
(who though in the world, was not of the world)
was pleaſed after ſome few years to take him to
himſelf out of this troubleſome life, who before
his Departure left my Mother the third part of
his Eſtate, and me in a moſt ſolemn manner his
Prayers and Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>After his deceaſe my Mother, who had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
care of my Education, for my further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in Literature ſent me to a learned and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
man, <hi>John Daniel Getſeus</hi> an High-German
Miniſter of <hi>Stock Gabriel</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon:</hi>
where I ſpent ſome years in ſtudying Humanity
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54889:9"/>
and Divinity, and found from his hands much
favour and love; for which kindneſs I pray God
to recompence him and his. Afterwards <hi>(ſumptâ
virili Togâ)</hi> I conſidered with my ſelf, that the
fortune which my Mother enjoyed in <hi>England</hi> was
very ſmall to maintain her ſelf and ſo many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as ſhe had (who grew daily more expenſive
as we grew in years); and thereupon I addreſſed
my ſelf to her, reſolving to loſe my life with my
fortune in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or re-gain it, who gave me her
bleſſing and conſent; and ſo after ſome 5 or 6
years abſence I returned to my native Country,
which at that time was in a moſt miſerable and
deplorable ſtate, as you may well remember;
for then it was not as formerly a National Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
<hi>Iriſh</hi> againſt <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Proteſtants againſt
Papiſts; but there were high and ſtrange diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
throughout the Kingdom, <hi>Engliſh</hi> againſt <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi>
and <hi>Iriſh</hi> againſt <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and Proteſtants and
Papiſts joyning hands in one Province againſt the
Proteſtants of another: which differences to me
ſeemed ſo unnatural, that I reſolved not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
therein, till the miſt of confuſion was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and ſo for refuge retired my ſelf to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of <hi>Caperquin,</hi> where I ſpent a years time in
contemplation, and ſaw ſo much of the madneſs
and wickedneſs of the world, that my life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a burthen to me, and my Soul was as weary
of this habitation of clay, as ever the Gally-ſlave
was of the Oar, which brought my life even to
the threſhold of death; ſo that my Legs had
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54889:10"/>
hardly ſtrength to carry my enfeebled body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout:
All company ſeemed irkſome and diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to me; ſo epidemically lewd, blaſphemous
and ſottiſh were many become, that I ſaw the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and great Judgments of the Lord that the
Kingdom groaned under, had not reclaimed, but
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like hardned our <hi>Egyptian</hi> hearts; which
cauſed me ſeldom during that time to go from my
Cell.</p>
            <p>In the Year 49. (as I take it) ſome ſmall time
after the Rout at <hi>Dublin, Oliver Cromwell</hi> then
General of the Army, after the taking of <hi>Tredagh,</hi>
ſent part of his Army into <hi>Munſter</hi> under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Colonel <hi>Robert Phaire;</hi> but before his
landing at <hi>Youghall, Cork</hi> and <hi>Youghall</hi> had revolted
from their obedience to their General the Earl of
<hi>Inchequin,</hi> then Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter</hi> under
the Command of his Majeſty, who is ever to be
honoured by all <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the eminent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſervices done to the Proteſtants in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the late Rebellion there: So that all, or
moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Proteſtants joyned with
the ſaid Colonel <hi>Phaire</hi> againſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
their Intereſts as well as Judgments being
oppoſite; ſo that in a ſmall time moſt of the
Towns in <hi>Munster</hi> were reduced to Obedience,
and the Command of the Horſe in the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
was given to (that Renowned and Worthy
Perſon) your Brother the Earl of <hi>Orrery,</hi> in whoſe
Regiment I was made a Lieutenant: during all
which time, which was 6 years, I will boldly ſay I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54889:10"/>
never ſuffered Quarter to be broken, nor violence
offered to any that were in protection; nor did I
ſuffer any one under my Command to oppreſs or
injure any that were in Quarter, without bringing
them to condigne puniſhment: nor did I permit
any Women or Children to be killed though out
of Protection, where I had a power to reſtrain the
fury of the Souldier. In the Year 56. great part
of the Army was diſbanded, and I among the reſt,
and then I betook my ſelf to a Country life, and
lived at <hi>Affane</hi> the habitation of my Anceſtors,
where I have continued ever ſince, and got by my
Induſtry a livelihood out of the bowels of the
Earth, and daily employed many poor people to
work, and improved that little Eſtate which I had
ſo, that I bleſs God I lived as comfortably as he
that had Thouſands, and daily relieved thoſe that
were in want, and gave my Friends and Strangers
a hearty welcome to what God in mercy had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon me, who never coveted much, nor
denyed my ſelf and others the enjoyment of what
I had. But by the way.</p>
            <p>Aſſoon as I was retired into the Country, I was
by the kindneſs and reſpect of the then Governour
made Clerk of the Peace of the County of <hi>Cork,</hi>
and Regiſter for Tranſplantation, and Juſtice of
the Peace: In which Employment I ſtudied ſo to
acquit my ſelf before God and Man in ſingleneſs
and integrity of heart, that to the comfort of my
Soul, and praiſe of God that directed me, I can
with confidence ſay, I never took Bribe nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54889:11"/>
from any man, though I have had many and
great ones offered me (when I was Regiſter for
Tranſplantation:) nor did I ever connive at or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a Malefactor to go unpuniſhed, if the perſon
were guilty of any notorious crime (where I had
a Power:) nor did I ever take the Fee belonging
to my Office, if I found the Perſon were injured
or in want: Nor did I ever commit any one for
his Judgment or Conſcience barely; ſo it led him
not to do any thing to the diſturbance of the civil
Peace of the Nation: Nor did I take any thing
for my Fee when he was diſcharged; for I bleſs
God he has taken away a perſecuting Spirit from
me, who would perſwade all men to be Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
thoſe Principles being moſt conſonant to
Truth and the Word of God in my Judgment, and
that Profeſſion which I ever have been of and ſtill
am: But Truth it is, That when I was Juſtice of
the Peace, I endeavoured to convert as many
Papiſts to Proteſtantiſm as I could, and prevailed
with many hundreds to go to Church, for theſe
two Reaſons,</p>
            <p>1. For the good of their ſouls who lived in
ignorance, having no Prieſts in thoſe days, and
being little the better for them now (I conceive)
the Common People underſtanding little La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</p>
            <p>2. For the preſervation of our own Bodies and
Eſtates, which I found by ſad Experience as well
as the reſt of the poor Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
could never be ſecure whileſt ſuch dangerous
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54889:11"/>
Principles were inſtilled into them as theſe; <hi>That
there was no Faith to be had with Hereticks, and
ſo it is lawful to make a prey of our lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</hi>
The Papiſts may deny that this is one of
their Tenents, but I am ſure it was the practice
of my Country-men, for whom I have this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
That if they were not ſtrangers to the word
of God they would not run into ſuch violent
courſes as they did: Yet (though there was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from the Power that then was (to all Juſtices
of the Peace) for Tranſplanting all Papiſts that
would not go to Church) I never moleſted any
one that was known, or eſteemed to be innocent,
but ſuffered them to continue in the Engliſh Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and that without prejudice: So that I can
truly ſay I never injured any man for his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
conceiving that ought to be informed and
not enforced. Beſides (Sir) I have ſo far obſerved
the immoderate courſes of ſeveral that were in
Power and Authority in thoſe days, amongſt
thoſe different Judgments who have had their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
turns at the Helm, That they have driven
<hi>Jehu</hi>-like, when they have had the Reins of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in their hands, and by their own fury de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
themſelves and intereſts, God abhorring
the violent and cruel-minded man,</p>
            <p>Who would have all Knees bow to his <hi>Dagon,</hi>
or take occaſion either to caſhier or put them by
their Employments, (as was the uſual practice of
the Army there in thoſe dayes) ſo that Charity
had left Religion, which too too many made a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54889:12"/>
meer deſign to promote their Intereſts and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Thus one Faction deſtroyed another, till at
length they all lay down in ſorrow, and he that
was moſt violent ſtill came to the worſt.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have given you a brief account how
I ſpent my time before I laid my hands on any,
and now I ſhall proceed to let you know how I
have demeaned my ſelf ſince, with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
and cauſes that moved me to attempt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
of this nature, for which I have been judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and condemned by many, and that as ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as maliciouſly: But bleſſed be God I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
a good Conſcience, in not burying that
Talent which God ſo entruſted me withall, and
his mercy has ſhielded me from their Darts.</p>
            <p>About four years ſince I had an Impulſe, or a
ſtrange perſwaſion in my own mind (of which I
am not able to give any rational account to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
which did very frequently ſuggeſt to me that
there was beſtowed on me the gift of curing the
Kings-Evil: which, for the extraordinarineſs of
it, I thought fit to conceal for ſome time, but at
length I communicated this to my Wife, and told
her, That I did verily believe, that God had given
me the bleſſing of curing the Kings-Evil; for
whether I were in private or publick, ſleeping or
waking, ſtill I had the ſame Impulſe; but her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
was to me, That ſhe conceived this was a
ſtrange imagination: but to prove the contrary,
a few daies after there was one <hi>William Maher</hi> of
<hi>Salterbridge</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Liſſmore</hi> (a Tenant
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54889:12"/>
of your Brothers the Right Honourable the Earl
of <hi>Burlington</hi> and <hi>Cork)</hi> that brought his Son <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Maher</hi> to my houſe, deſiring my Wife to
cure him, who was a perſon ready to afford her
Charity to her Neighbours, according to her ſmall
skill in Chirurgery; on which my Wife told me
there was one that had the Kings-Evil very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
in the Eyes, Cheek, and Throat; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I told her that ſhe ſhould now ſee whether
this were a bare fancy or imagination as ſhe
thought it, or the Dictates of Gods Spirit on my
heart; and thereupon I laid my hands on the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
affected, and prayed to God for Jeſus ſake to
heal him, and then I bid the Parent two or three
days afterwards to bring the Child to me again,
which accordingly he did, and then I ſaw the Eye
was almoſt quite whole, and the Node, which was
almoſt as a big as a Pullets Egg, was ſuppurated,
and the throat ſtrangely amended, and to be brief
(to Gods glory I ſpeak it) within a month diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it ſelf quite and was perfectly healed, and ſo
continues God be praiſed.</p>
            <p>Then there came one <hi>Margaret Mac-ſhane</hi> of
<hi>Ballinecly</hi> of the Pariſh of <hi>Liſmore,</hi> and a Tenant
of your Brothers the Earl of <hi>Cork,</hi> who had the
Evil 7 years and upwards, which had ſpred it ſelf
from the bottom of her ſtomack upwards, all over
to her throat, neck, and noſe, and ſo all over her
back, ſhoulders and arm-pits, ſo that I could not
ſee one place free from the Evil, where you might
put a ſixpence, and to ſpeak the truth ſhe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54889:13"/>
ſo dreadfully, and ſtunk ſo exceedingly, that
ſhe would have affrighted and poyſoned any one
almoſt that ſaw or came neer her; whereupon I
ſpoke to one Doctor <hi>Anthony</hi> (a famous Phyſitian,
then at my Houſe) deſiring him to take commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
on her for Gods ſake: His reply was, That
ſhe was eaten out with the Evil, and that all the
men in <hi>Ireland</hi> could do her no good; whereupon
I ſaid, I did believe that there was one that could
do her good, and cure her; the Doctor demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
who that man was; my anſwer was, That
through Gods bleſſing I could: but he ſlighted
the matter ſaying, if he ſaw that Perſon cured, he
would not queſtion but I might heal all Diſeaſes;
but I replyed I was not of his opinion as to the
latter part, but ſaid, he ſhould be convinced of
the former; which accordingly fell out, (God be
praiſed) for my hand ſuppurated the Nodes, and
drew and healed the Sores, which formerly I could
not have endured the ſight of, nor ſmell, nor touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them without vomitting; ſo great an averſion
had I naturally to all wounds and ſores: ſo that
the poor woman about ſix weeks afterwards came
perfectly well to my houſe, (and ſo continues)
where Doctor <hi>Anthony</hi> was then alſo, to ſee my
Wife, and gave God praiſe and me thanks; who
carryed her to Doctor <hi>Anthony,</hi> and told him,
That hence he might ſee, that God could and did
great things by poor and worthleſs Inſtruments,
and therefore he ſhould not limit him for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:54889:13"/>
After this ſeveral people infected with the Evil,
came to me from ſeveral Counties, and I ſtroked
them, and deſired God out of his abundant mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to heal them, who (bleſſed be his Name) heard
my Prayer, and delivered them: So that few or
none, unleſs thoſe whoſe Bones were infected and
eaten, returned without their cure: This courſe
I kept for 3 years, not medling with any other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
about which time the <hi>Ague</hi> was very Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical,
whole Families being ſtruck down with
it; when I found as formerly the ſame kind of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
within me, ſuggeſting that there was beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon me the gift of curing the <hi>Ague:</hi> This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
I told to my Wife, who could not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to it: and the next day there came to my
Houſe a Neighbours Wife, who lived nigh <hi>Tallow-bridge</hi>
(a place well known to you) by name
<hi>Bateman,</hi> the Naylors Wife that is there, who had
a moſt violent <hi>Ague,</hi> on whom I laid my hands,
and deſired God Almighty to cure her, who in
mercy heard my Prayer, and ſo the <hi>Ague</hi> run
through her, and ſhe went away immediately, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured of her <hi>Ague:</hi> upon which her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and Children, who were afflicted with the
ſame diſeaſe, applyed themſelves to me, on whom
I laid my hands in like manner with the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
and ſo many more came to me afterwards,
and were cured by Gods great and wonderful
power in the like nature.</p>
            <p>Within ſome ſmall time after this God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the ſame or the like Impulſe to diſcover un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54889:14"/>
to me, That he had given me the gift of healing;
which the morning following I told my Brother
and Wife, but neither of them could be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with to believe it, though for my own part I
had a full aſſurance thereof within me: This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
I had the Sunday after <hi>Eaſter</hi>-day, the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of
<hi>April,</hi> 65. early in the morning, and the <hi>Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
enſuing I went to Cornet <hi>Deans</hi> (about ſome
occaſions I had with him) to <hi>Liſmore,</hi> where there
came into his Houſe to me a poor man, that with a
violent pain in his loins and flank went almoſt
double, and had alſo a moſt grievous Ulcerous
Leg very black, wherein were five Ulcers; who
deſired me for Gods ſake that I would lay my
hands on him, and do him what good I could. [But
by the way take notice, That as God gave me the
ſeveral gifts from time to time, he alwayes ſent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
that applyed themſelves to me, for I never
ſought after any from the firſt moment to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inſtant.] Whereupon I put my hand on his loins
and flank, and immediately run the pains out of
him, ſo that he was releaſed, and could ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
without the leaſt trouble: Then I put my
hand on his Ulcerous Leg (which the <hi>Chirurgeons,</hi>
after they had ſhewed all their skill on him, told
him it was periſhed at the bone, and ſo muſt be
cut off, but that he wanted 3l. to give one of
them for his pains, as he informed me) which forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
changed colour and became red, and 3 of
the 5 Ulcers cloſed up, and the reſt within a few
hours afterwards; ſo that he went out well, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54889:14"/>
could hardly by the help of his ſtaff craul in, and
within two dayes afterwards he fell to his Labour
(being a Maſon by Trade) and ſo continued ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Months afterwards to my knowledge, and to
this inſtant (for ought I know.) The man was a
<hi>York-ſhire</hi> man, one that the Right Honourable the
Earl of <hi>Cork</hi> brought from thence, and employed
about the making of his Park-Wall nigh <hi>Liſmore.</hi>
This and the former inſtances I relate unto you,
That you may not ſeek far for the confirmation of
the Truth, if you or others ſhould diſtruſt my
Report.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Thurſday</hi> following I went to ſee Colonel
<hi>Phaire</hi> at <hi>Cahirmony</hi> in the County of <hi>Cork,</hi> who
when I came, told me he was vexed with an <hi>Ague;</hi>
my Reply was, that through Gods bleſſing I could
cure him: He told me that I was welcome, and
within an hour it would ſeize him, who thought
it impoſſible for him to live two fits more, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the cold fit his hot one continued for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hours in that extremity, that no <hi>Fever</hi> could
be more violent: accordingly as he had ſaid his
cold fit arreſted him, and then I bid him to give
me his hand, which he did, and it pleaſed God
that from that time his Fit left him ſo that he had
it no more: Then there came ſeveral People to
his Houſe troubled with ſeveral Diſeaſes, deſiring
me for Gods ſake to cure them (at which paſſage
I was much amazed, not having told him nor any
one, but my Wife and Brother, of the Impulſe I
had, which was but the Sunday before) ſome had
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54889:15"/>
the <hi>Ague,</hi> ſeveral others the <hi>Falling-ſickneſs,</hi> others
the <hi>Kings-Evil,</hi> one the <hi>Fever,</hi> ſome pains, ſome
Aches and lameneſs, on whom I put my hands,
little thinking that the Pains would ſkip and fly
from place to place till they did run out, but that
the perſons might be cured without any ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the laying on of my hands; and ſeveral,
nay moſt of all Diſeaſes were immediately cured,
and thoſe that came exceeding lame, and ſo
had continued for many years (by their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
and others) went well home rejoicing and
praiſing God: At which extraordinary appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of God, the Lord knows my ſoul was wrapt
up with wonder and amazement, and my heart
filled with praiſes and thankſgivings to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
and moſt merciful Lord God, to whom
be the Glory, Power, and Praiſe for evermore
aſcribed: and certainly my heart melted into
tears, and has often ſince with this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
That the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> among ſo
many millions of men more pious, more wiſe,
and more learned, ſhould make choice and uſe of
ſo poor, ſo vile, and ſo contemptible a wretch as
I am, to be ſo peculiar an Inſtrument in his hand
of ſhewing mercy and deliverance to afflicted
poor creatures: Thus much I can ſay, it was for
no worth or ſanctity of mine, for I acknowledge
mine iniquities, and my ſins are not hid from me,
and confeſs it is thy mercy in Jeſus my bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
that I have not been conſumed long ſince,
but preſerved to this moment, to the praiſes and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54889:15"/>
glory of thy Name, to whom my ſoul doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up daily (as is moſt juſt and due) new ſongs
of Mercy and Deliverance on my own account,
and others to whom thou extendeſt thy boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
favours.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations, Sir, tranſport me, carrying
me from the Relation of what has been done by
the Inſtrument, to the commemoration and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the firſt and principal Agent, <hi>Jehovah:</hi>
But I know this Digreſſion will not ſeem harſh in
your ears, whoſe heart like a well tun'd Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is ſtrung with Prayer and Praiſes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will take yet a further latitude before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Narrative part of my diſcourſe as to
matter of fact, by anſwering ſome few Queries or
Objections, which I have often heard from many,
which may not ſeem impertinent to be placed
here, That it may prove a Bridle to their tongues
for the future. The firſt Quaery is,</p>
            <p>What need had God to cure Diſeaſes in this
Age of the world by any extraordinary means,
when as there is no new Doctrine to be expected,
or promulgated? and many the like fond and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
aſſertions tending to this purpoſe. To which
I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are not of God Almighties Privy
Council, neither have they ſo much reaſon or
Religion as confidence; for if they had, they
would be more ſober and leſs preſumptuous then
to interrogate what his mind or will is in doing
what they ſee <hi>(de facto)</hi> done, and ſo rather with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54889:16"/>
humble thoughts admire and praiſe him, whoſe
mercy endureth for ever, then expoſtulate the
cauſe of things, why and wherefore he has done
it, or made uſe of ſuch Inſtruments; as one quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
of me at a Great Mans Table, and would
have reaſon wherefore God did make choice of
me ſooner then another to do things in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
manner, or what it was he ſaw in me
more then another man, and many ſuch Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
my Reply was a ſmile, which was the beſt
I could uſe in anſwering ſuch fond Enquirers.
But by the way, Sir.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to preſuppoſe 2 or 3 Reaſons
why or wherefore God ſhould now cure diſeaſes
in an extraordinary manner. The firſt is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
this Age of Atheiſm, which (I am ſorry to
ſay it) many of our pretended Wits I fear are fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into, who make it their paſtime to deride at
Jeſus and Chriſtianity, who cannot yet but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Jeſus to be God, when they ſee pains and
diſeaſes to vaniſh, and evil Spirits flye his Power;
as I have good cauſe to believe the Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and other Diſtempers I have met withal ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to be, which I intend upon another occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to prove by ſuch Reaſons drawn from my own
experience, as may convince any man that is but
a curious Obſerver, and truſts not the Writings
of men that ſpeak but their thoughts in caſes of
this nature, more then his own eyes or the eyes of
faithful witneſſes. Next, the goodneſs of God,
out of compaſſion to poor diſtreſſed man, may
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54889:16"/>
make uſe of never ſo worthleſs an Inſtrument to
magnifie his own mercy and power, as he did of
a brazen Serpent in the wilderneſs, that the glory
and praiſe of all may be ſolely aſcribed unto him,
who by a little duſt and clay can cure, and cauſe
diſeaſes to run through men, which no Phyſick
could move. Next, God may, to abate the pride
of the Papiſts (that make Miracles the undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Manifeſto of the truth of their Church) make
uſe of a Proteſtant to do ſuch ſtrange things in the
face of the Sun, which they pretend to do in
Cells. There may alſo other Reaſons be given,
and ſuch as may tend to Gods glory, but I ſhall
decline mentioning of them, leſt I fall under the
laſh of unmerciful Pens, and the cenſure of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
knowing that Truth it ſelf is ſometimes
better concealed than publiſhed.</p>
            <p>In the next place many demand of me, Why
ſome are cured and not all, and if this work
were of God all would be cured? To which Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
I make this Anſwer; That God may pleaſe
to make uſe of ſuch means by me as ſhall operate
according to the diſpoſition of the Patient; and
therefore cannot be expected to be like effectual
in all. They alſo demand further, Why ſome
are cured at once coming and not all; and why
the pains ſhould flye immediately out of ſome, and
take ſuch ambages in others; and why it ſhould
go out of ſome at their eyes, ſome at their fingers,
ſome at their toes, ſome at their noſes, others at
their ears or mouths? To which I ſay; If all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54889:17"/>
theſe things could have a plain and rational ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
given of them, then would there be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to account them ſtrange.</p>
            <p>Let them but tell me what ſubſtance that is
which removes and goes out with ſo great expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and it will be more eaſie to reſolve their
Queſtions; but till then let them be ſilent and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the works of God, whoſe ways are paſt
finding out, and whoſe Majeſty is not confined to
time, manner, or meaſure.</p>
            <p>Some will know of me why or how I do purſue
ſome pains from place to place, till I have chaſed
them out of the Body by laying my hands on the
outſide of the cloaths only (as is uſual) and not all
pains. To which I anſwer; That I and others
have by frequent experience been abundantly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that it is ſo, though I am not able to give
a reaſon why it ſhould be ſo; although I am apt
to believe, there are ſome pains which afflict men
after the manner of Evil-Spirits, which kind of
pains cannot endure my hand, nay not my glove,
but flye immediately, though 6 or 8 Coats and
Cloaks be put betwixt the parties body and my
hand; as at <hi>York-houſe</hi> the Lady <hi>Ranaloughs,</hi> and
divers other places ſince I came to <hi>London</hi> (where
many wiſe and learned men have been preſent, as
well as frequently in <hi>Ireland)</hi> has been mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
            <p>Sir, I hope you will pardon me when I relate
to you my own Obſervations, and what my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
inclines me to believe, in ſaying that I
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54889:17"/>
have met with ſeveral Inſtances which ſeemed to
me to be Poſſeſſions by dumb Devils, deaf Devils,
and talking Devils; and that to my apprehenſion,
and others preſent, ſeveral evil Spirits one after
the other have been purſu'd out of a Woman, and
every one of them have been like to choak her
(when it came up to her Throat) before it went
forth; and when the laſt was gone, ſhe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
well, and ſo continued. There have been
others that have faln down immediately as ſoon as
they have ſeen me, which the Mayor of <hi>Worceſter,</hi>
Colonel <hi>Birch,</hi> Major <hi>Wilde,</hi> and many hundreds
both at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and here, and other places, were
eye-witneſſes of; many, when they have but heard
my voice, and have been tormented in ſo ſtrange
a manner that no one that has been preſent could
conceive it leſs then a Poſſeſſion; as I will inſtance
in one at <hi>York-houſe</hi> (where Sir <hi>John Hinton,</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Talbot,</hi> aed many others were preſent) who had
ſomewhat within her which would ſwell her Body
to that exceſſive degree on a ſudden as if it would
burſt her; and then as ſoon as I put my hand on
that part of her Body where it did riſe up, it would
fly up to her Throat (or ſome other place), and
then it would cauſe her neck to ſwell half ſo big
again, and then almoſt choak her, then blind her,
and make her dumb and foam, and ſometimes fly
into her hand, and ſo contract and faſten it, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sir <hi>J. Hinton,</hi> or any elſe that did try (as there
were many) could with all their ſtrength open
one finger of her hand; nor would it fly his hand
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54889:18"/>
in the leaſt, nor any other perſons there, till I put
my hand on it, or my glove; nay, I oftentimes
brought it up into her Tongue (by running my
hand on her Body, on the out-ſide of her
Cloathes, up to her Throat) which it has ſwoln in
an inſtant nigh as big again, and has been ſeen
plainly to play from place to place, and at length
with great violence of belching (which did almoſt
choak her, and force her eyes to ſtart out of her
head) it went forth, and ſo the Woman went away
well. Whether this were a natural Diſtemper,
let any one judg that is either a Divine, a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
or Phyſitian. I could inſtance you in fourty
as ſtrange or ſtranger; but I will go no further
then <hi>London,</hi> and places adjoyning, for inſtances
of this nature.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, another Queſtion hereon will ariſe
(which I have often times heard from others) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I proceed; and that is, Whether this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my Hand proceeds from the Temperature
of my Body, or from a Divine Gift, or from both?
To which I ſay, That I have reaſon to believe that
there is ſomething in it of an extraordinary Gift of
God: The Reaſons and Arguments which incline
me to this belief are, That I am very ſenſible of
the particular time when this Gift was firſt beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on me, before which time I had it not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
having my ſelf for ſeveral years together
been moſt violently troubled with the head-ach,
though I have put my hand a thouſand times to
my head and held it, it would neither remove
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54889:18"/>
nor run out the pains; but ſince God gave my
hand this Gift, I have no ſooner put it on my head
where it was troubled, but I have removed and
run it out. I have alſo oftentimes held my Friends
heads formerly, when they have been in violent
pains with the head-ach; but I never could hear
them ſay their pain removed or ceaſed, which now
immediately it do's in very many. What the natural
efficacy of effluvias may be I leave others to judge;
and I ſuppoſe no man will queſtion but that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Gift may be exerciſed by natural
means, or that God may confer in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
manner ſuch a temper of Body upon a perſon
as may by a natural efficacy produce theſe effects:
Only by the way I ſhall ſuggeſt to you an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made at the Houſe of that excellent Perſon
your Siſter, the Lady <hi>Ranalaghs,</hi> where I tried (to
ſatisfie the curioſity of ſome there) with a Napkin
which I rubbed my breaſt withal, and with my
Shirt which I had pulled off, being very hot, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that would remove the pains of a Woman
which was in ſtrange fits there (as my glove, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tried, did oftentimes) and it would not.</p>
            <p>I could uſe many more Inſtances, and anſwer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Objections; but I think that will be
more proper hereafter; and therefore I ſhall now
return again to matter of fact, by letting you
know that great Multitudes from divers places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted
to me, ſo that I could have no time to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
my own occaſions, nor enjoy the company
of my Family and Friends: whereupon I ſet 3
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54889:19"/>
days in the week apart (from 6. in the morning
till 6. at night) to lay my hands on all that came,
and ſo continued for some months at home: But
the multitudes which came daily were ſo great,
that the neighbouring Towns were not able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
them; whereon for the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
I left my home and went to <hi>Youghall,</hi> where
great multitudes reſorted to me, not only of the
Inhabitants, but alſo out of <hi>England;</hi> ſo that the
Magiſtrates of the Town told me, that they were
afraid that ſome of the ſick people that came to
me out of <hi>England</hi> might bring the Infection into
the place: whereon I retired again to my houſe
at <hi>Affane,</hi> where (as at <hi>Youghall)</hi> I obſerved three
days by laying my hands on all that came, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the diſeaſes were (and many were cured
and many were not); ſo that my Stable, Barn, and
Malt-houſe were filled with ſick people of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
almoſt: yet ſo great was the Providence of
God, that I do not remember that in all that
time any one of my Family (though I touched
them in my houſe) was ever infected by them;
neither did any of them, though they herded all
together, infect one the other. But this by the
way.</p>
            <p>The Dean of <hi>Liſmore</hi> (my reverend and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Friend) by orders from the Biſhop and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
hearing of Cures done in an extraordinary
manner, cited me to appear at the Court of <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi>
to which Citation I gave Obedience, and
accordingly appeared, deſiring to know what
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54889:19"/>
they had to lay to my charge; the anſwer of the
Court was, that they heard I had effected Cures
in an extraordinary manner, and therefore deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to know whether the report were true or no:
to which I anſwered, That that doubt might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
be ſatisfied, by coming one day to my Houſe,
where they might have an occular Teſtimony of
Truth in that particular, or that they might ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
themſelves by ſeveral that were without the
Court, that through Gods bleſſing were reſtored,
by laying my hands on them, from ſeveral infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and diſeaſes which they formerly laboured
under: on which the Judge of the Court cauſed
the Recorder to enter what I had ſaid, and took
for granted that people were cured in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way: Then the Judge asked me, where is
your Licence for practiſing, as all Phyſitians and
Chirurgeons ought to have from the Ordinary of
the Dioceſs? my anſwer was, that I knew no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
I had to take a Licence, ſince I took no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
from any one, and that I knew no Law of
the Nation, which prohibited any perſon from
doing what good he could to his Neighbours; yet
notwithſtanding becauſe I had no Licence (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would I take any, not expecting any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by what I did) I was prohibited from laying
my hands on any for the future: which Order I
obſerved for two dayes, but going to the Town of
<hi>Copoqueen,</hi> where there were many poor people,
that came out of <hi>England</hi> to me for ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
which they laboured under, and amongſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54889:20"/>
the reſt, two that had the <hi>Falling-ſickneſs,</hi> who no
ſooner ſaw me but they fell into their fits immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
which cauſed ſo great compaſſion in me,
that I could not, nor durſt not deny them my help;
whereupon I put my hands on them, and by the
power of God reſtored them to their ſenſes forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and purſued their Pains from place to place,
till they went out of them; after that I fell to my
former practice, and obſerved the three dayes
which I formerly ſet apart, whereupon the Lord
Biſhop of the Dioceſs ſent for me, and tole me
that he required me to lay my hands on no more
within his Dioceſs: but I anſwered his Lordſhip,
that I conceived that I tranſgreſſed no Law of
God or man in doing the works of Charity, and
therefore I thought my ſelf obliged thereby not
to deny any man my help (whileſt God enabled
me to do good) that came to me: And ſo I part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his Lordſhip, and returned to my own
houſe, where I perſevered in my former practice
both at home, <hi>Dublin,</hi> and elſewhere, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my occaſions called me, till at length about
<hi>January</hi> laſt, at the requeſt of the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
the Earl of <hi>Orrery,</hi> I was perſwaded to come
over into <hi>England,</hi> to the Right Honourable the
Viſconteſs <hi>Conway,</hi> who for many years had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
under a moſt violent Head-ach (which
many of the ableſt Phyſitians in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France</hi> had unſucceſsfully attempted the cure of.)
And ſo did accordingly, reſolving to land by <hi>King-Road</hi>
nigh <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and ſo go to the habitation of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54889:20"/>
my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> in <hi>Warwick-ſhire,</hi> concealed; but
the wind falling ſhort we were forced into <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
where I was ſo well known by ſeveral Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
that had been with me in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that I could
not conceal my ſelf; and ſo was by the Country
(as I went) reſorted to from place to place till I
came to <hi>Ragley,</hi> the reſidence of the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and moſt worthy perſon my Lord Viſcont
<hi>Conway,</hi> to whom I am for ever endeared and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged;
for his Lordſhips extraordinary favour and
reſpect (notwithſtanding I could not remove or
abate his Ladies pain in the leaſt;) which kindneſs
of his I beſeech God to return to him a thouſand
fold: but finding her Ladiſhips pain incurable by
me, I reſolved ſpeedily to return home, but at
the entreaty of my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> I remained with
his Honour at <hi>Ragley</hi> three weeks or a month,
where many hundreds daily came to me from divers
Counties, and many were cured of their Diſeaſes
and Diſtempers, and many were not: from thence
at the entreaty of the Mayor and Aldermen of the
City of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> I went thither (where I met
with ſeveral high Diſtempers and Diſeaſes, many
whereof I bleſs God were cured) reſolving to ſtay
four or five dayes with them, but in the interim
I received an Order from the Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> by
command of his Majeſty, to come to <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
which I forthwith obſerved (being glad to be
freed from ſo great crouds as were at <hi>Worceſter,</hi>
where I was like to be bruiſed to death) reſolving
within three or four dayes to return to my Lord
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54889:21"/>
               <hi>Conways</hi> again, but by the entreaties of Juſtice
<hi>Godfrey</hi> and others, my honoured and worthy
riend, I was perſwaded to ſtay in theſe parts,
daily doing what good the Lord enabled me, till
I met with your Honour, whoſe Judgment and
Wiſdom was ſo great that you would not credit
or diſtruſt matters of fact on bare report, and
were therefore pleaſed ſeveral times at the place
where I uſed to be in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-fields</hi> (and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where)
to be an eye witneſs of what was done,
and to bring ſeveral other learned and worthy
Perſons with you, that they might alſo bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to the truth of what appeared, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
me to give this account to the world, and
to take Teſtimonials of ſuch remarkable Cures as
I could remember were done ſince I came to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and in the preſence of men of Note: which
Circumſtance I therefore mention to you, that it
may not be imagined that this is an account of all
the Diſtempers I have been inſtrumental in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
ſince I have omitted all thoſe at which it
did not happen that eminent perſons were preſent,
and willing to atteſt them; and all thoſe other
Cures which had been already performed in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other places, divers of which were ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
that if it be deſir'd, I may hereafter give you
an account of them apart: Which Teſtimonials I
herewith preſent unto you (but what was done
before your coming to <hi>London,</hi> I can give little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of, it not being my cuſtom to ask any mans
name, or the place from whence he came, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54889:21"/>
he goes, till within this Month or five weeks)
by which the matter of Fact (I hope) will be ſo
clear in it ſelf, that I need not uſe any further
arguments to gain belief in the Reader; I ſhall
not here make uſe of any Cure done elſe-where,
or of any common, or trivial one, or of more
than what I conceive will be ſufficient to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
Truth, to Gods glory, and the ſatisfaction
of all good men: and when this is done (God-willing)
I will retire to my own home and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Now whether I have done my duty as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
in imploying that Talent which God had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
me withall, to the good of People diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and afflicted, or no, judge you, and every
good man. Thus far I appeal to the world, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I have taken rewards, deluded, or deceived
any man; and whether I have not made it my
conſtant practiſe, when any came that I judged
was incurable, to deſire them to repair to their
own home, and not put themſelves to further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
and trouble: God (to whom I appeal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
him ſtill to ſhield me with his mercy, and
to keep me humble and faithful) knows what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and reproaches I have ſuffered, what la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and dangers I have undergone, and what
loſſes and croſſes I have ſuſtained for his names
ſake, and the good of others. All that I will ſay,
is, I pray God forgive my Enemies, and make me
never weary of well-doing, let the world judge
and ſay what they pleaſe, that I may be found a
faithful Steward when I come to give up my laſt

               <p>ACcording to your deſire I thought fit to
give you an account of Cures, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my own knowledge I know to have been
done by Mr. <hi>Valentine Greatrak's:</hi> One <hi>Thomas
Burt</hi> a day Labourer, who lives in the ſame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54889:26"/>
with me at <hi>Radcliff</hi> in the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi>
was the beginning of <hi>Feb.</hi> laſt ſent by me into <hi>Kent,</hi>
to do ſome work for me there, and got an Ague,
which held him very violently for many hours
every fit, and likewiſe fell into his thigh and knee,
and did very much ſwell in his knee, and put him
to very great pain, ſo that he was forced to leave
his work, and came to my houſe in <hi>Lincoln-Inn-fields,</hi>
where he had his Ague as before, and the
ſwelling of his knee I ſaw, which was very great,
and made him ſo lame that he could ſcarce goe: I
got Mr. <hi>Godfrey</hi> to procure him to be ſtroked by
the ſaid Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the ſixth of
<hi>March</hi> in the morning, and he came to my houſe at
noon and ſhewed me his knee, and the ſwelling
was gone, and ſo was all his pain and lameneſs,
and he had no more fits of his Ague; he is gone
to his work again, and hath continued well ever
ſince. A ſervant of mine own, <hi>William But,</hi> who
likewiſe got an Ague at the ſame place in <hi>Kent,</hi>
was cured by him without taking any thing for
it, and continues well. A ſervant of mine, one <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Dimmack,</hi> who nurſed my eldeſt Son, hath had
a ſore leg almoſt theſe 8 years, which the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
ſaid was a <hi>Cancer,</hi> but ſhe could have no
help for it, either from Chirurgeons or Phiſitians,
but it grew worſe and worſe; by ſtroking it four
or five times it is in a manner healed, and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
in a ſhort time will be perfectly healed. I
have likewiſe been preſent when I have ſeen him
do very many great Cures, and namely pains in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54889:26"/>
the head I have ſeen him drive out of the body,
and cure divers of the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> who as they ſaid

and one who came with crutches, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
without them.</p>

the hands of Mr. <hi>Valentine Greatrak's,</hi> which I cannot attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to proceed but from ſome extraordinary Power. My
ſelf having obſerved very much his life and converſation, and
by my Enquiry of ſeveral others who were formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with him, I could never hear him juſtly impeached
of any unhandſome carriage in his deportment. I having
examined ſeveral perſons before they came under his hands
what their Infirmities were, and how long they had been
troubled with their griefs, who have anſwered me, ſome a
year, ſome more, ſome leſs; and after he had done with
them, I examined what benefit they had received, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
very much; for before ſome could not go, nor move
their hands to their heads, but after he had done with them,
they could do both, my ſelf having been a Spectator of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of thoſe paſſages. Beſides, I cannot but teſtifie ſome
experience of my own ſelf, by whom I am ſatisfied I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a very great benefit, I having a very great Fit of the
Stone. I having not riſen out of my bed two hours, but a
violent Fit of the Stone ſeized on me; inſomuch that I could
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54889:28"/>
not ſtand on my feet, nor make water, and was going into
my bed again; and in leſs then half a quarter of an hour
after he had touched me, I did void a very great lump of
gravel, beſides ſeveral ſmaller parcels; after which I did
make water very freely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was very well, and have ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ever ſince.</p>

Head-ach which I laboured under 3 or 4 years (and uſed
what means the Phyſitians preſcribed, though unſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
which oftentimes was very violent, was cured by the
laying on of Mr. <hi>Greatrak</hi>'s hand, in the manner following;
<hi>viz.</hi> about the beginning of <hi>March</hi> laſt, hearing that Mr.
<hi>Greatrak's</hi> was at my Lord Mayors houſe, I repaired thither
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54889:28"/>
unto him, and deſired him (having the Head-ach violently
then on me) that he would be pleaſed to uſe his endeavours
to cure me; whereupon he demanded of me in what part
of my head the pain lay, which I ſhewed him; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he laid his hand upon the place affected, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I found the pain remove to another place of my head,
which I alſo directed him to, who purſued it till it went
out of my head; and ſo following it from place to place
(laying his hands on that place of my body whither my pain
did remove) till he drove it into my foot, where it was very
painful to me, till at length he chaſed it out at my toe, I not
putting off my ſtocking: Which he did at two ſeveral times,
the pain (as I conceive) being divided; whereupon I forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
found my ſelf freed from all manner of pain both in
head and body, and have ſo continued ever ſince (bleſſed be
God) in perfect health: And not only was I freed from the
aforeſaid pain of the head, but alſo from a conſtant bleeding
which continually attended it, whereas I did uſe to bleed
every day, (or every other day at leaſt) which bleeding I am
very little troubled with: This is that, Sir, which I affirm to

(according to her own relation) had ſome weeks before
been cured by Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> of the falling-ſickneſs, and did

now come to him to be ſtroked for a pain in her head; upon
his putting of his hand on her forehead, ſhe ſaid that her pain
did forthwith remove to her ſhoulders; upon the laying of
his hand on the Cloths of her ſhoulder, ſhe ſaid it ſlipped
into her arm, and ſo at another move, into her hand; from
whence being by his touch driven into her fingers, which
thereupon grew cold and ſtiff, I took her fingers between
my hands, endeavouring by friction to recover them to ſome
warmth, and limberneſs, and having continued this friction
for ſome while, I let her hand goe, and would have perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her that ſhe was cured: but ſhe replyed that the pain
ſtill continued upon her: to which Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> added,
that the upper joints of her fingers, into which he had driven
the cauſe of her pain, were dead, and that if ſhe were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them, ſhe would neither feel it, nor would any blood
come: for the tryal of which, having firſt ſeveral times pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the pulp of her fingers betwixt my nails with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
I did ſeveral times thruſt in a pin neer the bone, but
the woman was not ſenſible of either, neither did any blood
come: but upon two or three ſlight ſtrokes of his hand, ſhe
profeſſed to be eaſed of her pain, and her fingers to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to their wonted temper; and then being but gently
pricked with a pin, ſhe was ſenſible of it, and the blood
followed upon it. This I can truly, and do willingly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.</p>

               <p>WHereas you deſire ſome account of Mr. <hi>Greatrak's,</hi>
I make this return: I have ſeen and been preſent at
<hi>Aulceſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r</hi> and <hi>Ragly</hi> in <hi>Warwick-ſhire,</hi> and ſince in <hi>London,</hi>
when and where Mr. <hi>Valentine Greatrak's</hi> hath relieved and
reſtored very many perſons miſerably afflicted with ſeveral
diſtempers, particularly the Evil, the Falling-ſickneſs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions,
Palſey, Sores, and Ulcers, Aches, and Pains, Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Dimneſs of ſight, Lameneſs, and Feebleneſs of limbs,
and other great Evils, ſo as that the parties afflicted have
freely and abundantly expreſſed and declared that they
found themſelves much better than they were before, eaſed
of their aches and pains, and reſtored to the uſe of their
limbs and ſenſes, whereas they had been diſabled or depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for many years before: I have been preſent when ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
perſons thus helped and relieved, have with an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of joy and chearfulneſs given God thanks for the great
benefit they had received by means of Mr. <hi>Greatrak's:</hi> I have
been in company of perſons of good underſtanding and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
who have of their own accord declared and teſtified
that they themſelves have been eye-witneſſes of the like
good effects: 'Tis true, he doth not cure ſuch in whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ſpent, or where the parts or principles of nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
are defective, to whom at firſt coming to him he
doth commonly declare that he cannot help them: Some
others at the firſt or ſecond application to him he doth not
help, who afterwards are reſtored at their oftner coming to
him. And as concerning the way of his curing maladies, I
have very diligently obſerved him, but did never perceive
him to uſe any form of words, nor ſaw him do any thing
(in my judgment) liable to any ſuſpicion of any ill art or
device. And for his converſation I have been much in his
company, for the time of his being in <hi>England,</hi> and I never
ſaw any ill behaviour or unſeemly carriage in him, nor any
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54889:30"/>
intemperance, diſorder, or exceſs: I have great cauſe from
mine own obſervation to eſteem him a ſober and well-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
perſon, affable, civil, and courteous in his converſe,
and for his temper in Religion, he is not (ſo far as I could
diſcern) of any fond perſwaſion or vain conceit in matter
of Religion, but a devout acknowledger of God and of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, in whoſe name alone, and by whoſe power he
profeſſeth upon all occaſions to act: He declares himſelf a
Proteſtant, and an hearty lover of the Reformed Religion,
and profeſſeth to worſhip God according of the Rules and
Principles therof, and to live in the obedience of, and
communion with the Church of <hi>England:</hi> I believe him to
be of an unexceptionable and unblamable converſation,
through the experience I have had of him: And for my own
particular, he hath been to me an happy inſtrument of God;
to relieve and eaſe me of a very dangerous and painful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady,
which for many years had greatly diſabled and ſorely
afflicted me, for which before my coming to him I could
have no remedy; but notwithſtanding the uſe of all means I
could hear of, which all proved unſucceſsful, I was wholly
left in deſpair of ever obtaining a Cure, yet I neglected not
the advice of perſons of art and skill: But now by his
means, and his often application of his hand and ſpittle, I
am rid of all the pain and inflammation of the part diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and the tumour, fungous, and ſuperfluous fleſh, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
very grievous to me, is greatly abated, and decreaſeth
more and more daily; ſo that I am in very great hope that in
a little more time by his means it will wholly waſt away and
conſume, as the greater part ſince his touching already is,
through Gods mercy, for which I give hearty thanks to the
Divine goodneſs. This I account my ſelf bound, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of God as principal, and of doing right to Mr.
<hi>Greatrak's</hi> as his inſtrument, to teſtifie and declare, and in
witneſs whereof I ſubſcribe my name, <hi>April</hi> 3. 1666.</p>

               <p>BEing deſired to give my teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> and
his Cures, I do hereby certifie, That I have with ſome
curioſity been an obſerver of him and his operations; and I
take him to be a perſon of an honeſt and upright mind, a free
and open ſpirit, a cheerful and agreeable humour, an inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
converſation, of large and generous principles, and
that carries on no deſign of faction or intereſt. I have been
an eye-witneſs of many hundreds that have come under his
hands, eſpecially during his being at my Lord <hi>Conway's</hi> for
three weeks or a month together, and I muſt profeſs my ſelf
convinc'd (however it be, whether from an immediate gift,
or a peculiarity of complexion) that he has a vertue more
then ordinary; for though I have ſeen him touch many with
little or no ſucceſs, yet it muſt not be denyed but that I have
ſeen too in very many inſtances by his ſpittle and the touch or
ſtroking of his hand, humours put into odde and violent fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,
pains ſtrangely flye before him, till he has cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them out at ſome of the extreme parts of the body; the
Kings-evil in a few days wonderfully dryed up, knobs or ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
brought to a ſuppuration; tumours ripened; ulcerous
ſores skinn'd and amended; hard ſwellings in womens
breaſts abated; cold and ſenſeleſs limbs reſtored to heat and
life; ſcabs all over the body, which have been for many
years, and counted incurable, deadned and dryed up; many
people relieved in caſes of deafneſs, lameneſs, dimneſs of
ſight; twenty ſeveral perſons in Fits of the Falling-ſickneſs,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54889:31"/>
or Convulſions, or Hyſterical Paſſions, (for I am not wiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to diſtinguiſh them) upon the laying his hand upon
their breaſts (often upon the top of their cloaths) within a
few minutes brought to their ſenſes, ſo as to be able to tell
where their pain lay, which he has followed till he has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
it out of the body. I can ſay little to the permanency
of his Cures, many (I believe) do continue firm, but ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of thoſe of the Falling-ſickneſs I heard had relaps'd afore
I left the Country, but after much longer intervals then they
were wont to enjoy. There was a poor woman at <hi>Aulceſter</hi>
that I ſent to ſpeak with at my coming away, who had been
troubled with theſe Fits ever ſince ſhe was 13 years old, and
I take her to be now betwixt fifty and threeſcore; and for
ſome years paſt there was ſcarce a day that ſhe had been free
from them, and ſhe was inclin'd to them to that degree, that
coming neer any hot meat would bring her Fit upon her.
Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> brought her out of her Fit, and ſhe had then
continued well by the ſpace of 3 weeks, and could eat or
dreſs hot meat without any diſturbance: what has ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of her I can give no account. The Forms of wordshe
uſes are, <hi>God Almighty heal thee for his mercy ſake</hi> (or) <hi>for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
ſake;</hi> and if they profeſs to receive any benefit, he bids
them give God the praiſe; and that (ſo far as I can judge)
with a ſincere devotion. This is in ſhort the matter of fact,
which is teſtified to be true by me,</p>

               <p>HAving been preſent ſundry times when great numbers of
people reſorted to Mr. <hi>Valentine Greatrak's,</hi> and beheld
many wonderful Cures done by his hand, I could not refuſe
his deſire, that I would in writing declare ſomething of what
I have ſeen; and therefore do certifie as followeth:</p>
               <p>I was by, when he ſtroked a Servant of Mr. <hi>Faithornes</hi> (an
excellent Engraver near <hi>Temple-Bar)</hi> who had been lame a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54889:32"/>
twelve-month by a dead Palſey on the right ſide. After the
ſecond ſtroking he was able to go about the room with the
help of a ſtick, and in a little time grew to ſuch ſtrength,
that he now can work at his Trade again.</p>
               <p>The Wife of <hi>Samuel Smith</hi> of <hi>Newbury</hi> has been afflicted
with a violent pain in her back and hip ſeven years; which
made her ſo lame, that ſhe could not ſtir without ſome tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by the continuance of it, her life was become (as
ſhe ſaid) a burden to her. By gentle ſtroking he brought it
down to her foot, and in a few minutes (renewing his ſtrok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in thoſe places where ſhe ſaid any pain was remaining)
drove it quite away, ſo that ſhe could go without her ſtaff
as faſt as any of us there preſent. I have ſeen her ſeveral
times ſince, and ſhe continued in the ſame ſtrength; only
coming to him ſometimes to confirm it to her (and to remove
ſome ſmall grudgings which ſhe had of it) before ſhe went
into the Country.</p>
               <p>There was alſo a little after, a well known Artiſt in this
Town who deſired his help, having lain in intolerable pains
(as himſelf told me) for the ſpace of eleven months. I ſaw
him ſtroke his arm, and thigh, and leg, whither he purſued
the pain till he chaſed it out at his foot, and the Patient ſaid
he was perfectly free. I hear indeed ſince that his pain is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
but I have good reaſon to conclude, that if he had
applyed himſelf again to the ſame hand which eaſed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he might have received a greater benefit: For I know
one whom he gave relief unto that had been long tormented
in that faſhion; but within a day or two was in ſuch pain
that ſhe could not ſtir in her bed, and judged her ſelf worſe
then ever. Upon my deſire that he would go again to her,
(for ſhe could not come to him) he went, and after a few
gentle ſtrokings freed her ſo perfectly from her pains, that
for a conſiderable time after ſhe felt none at all; and I hope
ſtill remains at eaſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe are but a few of thoſe Inſtances which I could give
of this nature: To which if I ſhould adde what I have ſeen
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54889:32"/>
him do in the caſe of Deafneſs, of the Evil, Fits of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Wind, and ſuch like, it would be enough to fill a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume:
And yet I have not ſeen half ſo many Cures as other
Perſons of unſpotted credit have done, who had the leaſure
and opportunity to be more frequently with him. I never
yet met with any, who would have the patience diligently
to attend him for a few hours, who came away unſatisfied
about the reality of ſuch things as are reported. Nay ſome
perſons (not too forward of belief) have been convinced in a
few minutes: a ſmall acquaintance and ſhort converſe with
him, would alſo ſoon ſatisfie thoſe who doubt, that he is a
man of no deſigns: for he appears to me of too free an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and open diſpoſition, to be able to conceal and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
himſelf: There is nothing of reſervedneſs to be ſeen in
his temper: I could never diſcover any thing that looks like
craft and ſubtilty in him: He ſeems to be of a ſingular good
nature, and to be void of all covetouſneſs, pride, or hatred
of others: His charity and good will to mankind ſeems to be
great; and to be the only thing that moves him to engage
himſelf in ſuch perpetual labours: I never heard him ſpeak
any words unbecoming a Chriſtian: He profeſſes all loyalty
to his Prince, due reverence to his ſpiritual Governors, and
to be of the Reformed Religion, as it is here by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.
All which conſidered, me thinks he merits much
reſpect: and if this Teſtimony of mine may do him any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
I ſhall be very glad of it; becauſe of the obligation I
have to him for a Cure done upon my ſelf.</p>

               <p>I Having been an Eye-witneſs of ſeveral very wonderful
Cures performed by Mr. <hi>Greatrak's,</hi> and being deſired
to give under my hand what I know of them, I do affirm,
That the Right Honourable the Counteſs of <hi>Devonſhire's</hi>
chief Cook, a man of about 55 years of Age, having been of
a long time troubled with the Sciatica, was gently ſtroked
by Mr. <hi>Greatraks</hi>'s hand, and hath ever ſince continued very
well, it being now almoſt 2 months ſince. I likewiſe ſaw a
woman living in <hi>Roehampton,</hi> who had a great Wen over
her Eye, which by a miſchance ſhe had gotten above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years ſince; only by having it launced, and the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
twice preſſed forth by Mr. <hi>Greatrak's,</hi> was perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by him, without the uſe of any Plaiſter or other Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical
remedy. I likewiſe ſaw a Man in the ſame Town,

a year, which afterwards turned into a Quartane, and had
hung upon him almoſt half a year: This perſon I ſaw ſtrok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

had for ſome years a Cancer in his Noſe, and for the curing
of which he had without ſucceſs conſulted ſeveral Phyſitians)
ſo much amended ſince the application of Mr. <hi>Greatraks</hi>'s

Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> lay his hand upon ſeveral perſons for divers

which they laboured under ſeveral years; particularly <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Jones</hi> his Son of <hi>Mortlack</hi> aforeſaid, who was ſorely
bruiſed, brought in between two men; and upon his laying
on of his hands, the ſaid <hi>Walters</hi> pains run from place to

he acknowledged himſelf well, and went away without any

his mouth, and alſo blood by urine; whereby he continues
perfectly well to this inſtant, being about 5 weeks ſince.</p>
               <p>Alſo I ſaw a young man of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> who was for four

Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> drove out of his head into his body, where

               <p>SInce I had the favour of your Letter, I have been called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; imortuned by divers friends, and perſons of quality,
inhabiting ſeveral parts of the Nation, to inform my ſelf and
give them ſome accounts concerning Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> and his
attempts of curing Diſeaſes: I ſhall now take the liberty (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to promiſe) to give you in groſs what others have
received from me by piece-meal; and (by the way) I beg leave
to acquaint you, that whileſt I was making ſuperficial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
after him, and before I had ever ſeen the Gentlemans
face, a vertuous Lady, ſomtime my Patient, came to Town,
on purpoſe to implore his help, and calling of me would not
be ſatisfied until I had ſuffered my ſelf to be prevailed with
to accompany her to Colonel <hi>Weldons,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi>
then was, who at firſt ſight very frankly declared himſelf
to be cheerfully willing to gratifie all Doctors in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts;
and thereupon, though he had been at hard labour
moſt part of the day, and had ſufficient cauſe (as the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders
ſaid) to be throughly wearied, he beſtowed a full
half hour on this infirm Lady, gently rubbing her head, neck,
arms and back, her benummed leg and foot, as I had before
directed him, the Ladies woman and another aſſiſting to put
off her Cloaths and to put them on; which when he had
done, he ingenuouſly told me and the Gentleman that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the Lady, that he conceived himſelf unable to do
her any conſiderable good, Dead Palſies on the left ſide ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
giving place to, or being helped by the application of
his hands; but if ſhe pleaſed to come to him he would free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
afford her his pains, which he did once or twice after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54889:35"/>
to the great and only ſatisfaction of her mind, the
ſucceſs, as to her body, hitherto complying with his predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Notwithſtanding I muſt needs confeſs I then obſerved
ſtrange things performed by him, enough to puzle a ſtronger
head-piece than mine, though not to ſatisfie my Curioſity,
which being puſhed on by the Contents of your Letter, and
eagerly hurried with an earneſt deſire of ſeeing (as you had
done) Agues cured with eaſie frictions, hath ever ſince induced
me to improve all my leiſure in obſerving Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> his
Cures or Operations, the like whereof ('tis preſumed) will
hardly be found in any Author. I have lately ſpoken with
Mr. <hi>Buts,</hi> one of thoſe ſervants you mention, who had the
good fortune to looſe their <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Agues by the contact and
ſtroking of this wondrous mans hand; he tells me his fellow-ſervant
continues at work in your Saltern in <hi>Kent:</hi> that both
of them have ſtood ſound theſe two months, their Agues
never attempting to recoil upon them: I have alſo had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with divers eminent and worthy Divines, inferior to
few for parts, piety, and learning, who acknowledge and
affirm themſelves to have received help and cure from his
hand and ſpittle, of ſuch diſtempers in their own bodies as
had eluded the moſt exquiſite methods of Phyſick, and the
beſt remedies that could be preſcribed or adminiſtred to
them, in their particular caſes, by the moſt skilful and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
Artiſts.</p>
               <p>I minded very heedfully his comportment towards the
Lady that firſt brought me to him, and likewiſe towards
many others ſince that time, and have alwayes obſerved it
to be very comly, grave, and diſpaſſionate: I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
nor learn from others that he uſed any form of words,
either immediately before, or during the time he layes his
hands on any perſon; but when he hath done 'tis familiar
with him (his hands and eyes lift upwards) to repeat the
Ejaculation mentioned by Dean <hi>Ruſt,</hi> varied now and
then a little, <hi>viz. God Almighty heal,</hi> or <hi>help,</hi> or <hi>ſtrengthen
you</hi> or <hi>thee, for Jeſus ſake,</hi> or <hi>his mercyes ſake;</hi> and to thoſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54889:36"/>
who thankfully tell him they find eaſe or benefit, he alwayes
replies, <hi>The Lords name be praiſed,</hi> or <hi>give God the praiſe.</hi> It
is agreed by all who have had opportunities of frequent
converſe with him, that he appears to be a man of a free, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
and open temper, courteous and debonaire, without
any thing of affectation or reſervedneſs, of ſingular patience
and tender-heartedneſs towards all perſons in pain or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and one who declares himſelf in word and deed to be a
truly loyal Subject to his Prince, and an hearty lover of
thoſe in preſent ſervice at Sea or Land, as hath been often
manifeſted by his preferring Seamen and Soldiers, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
themſelves to him for help and eaſe of their aches, pains,
and lameneſs, to others of much higher rank and quality: and
indeed I ſaw not one of theſe poor perſons who had been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
uſeleſs for preſent ſervice, through their pains contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by heats and colds, but went away, after ſtroking, very
well pleaſed, with a profeſſed enjoyment of preſent eaſe,
and reſolution of repairing ſpeedily to the reſpective Ship
or Colours whereunto he did belong.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only inſtance in <hi>Joſeph Warden</hi> a ſtout Seaman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the <hi>Royal Charles,</hi> who was ſent on Crutches (as
you may remember) from St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> Hoſpital to Mr.
<hi>Greatrak's</hi> then in <hi>Chancery-lane,</hi> and complained not ſo much
of his pains, though thoſe he affirmed to be very grievous in
his hip, thigh, ham and ankle, as that he (who had been in all
former engagements againſt the <hi>Dutch)</hi> ſhould now be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
(if I may uſe his own words) to have the other warm
Bout with them: upon which I need not tell you (being
there preſent) with what alacrity and heartineſs Mr. <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak's</hi>
ſtroked him, I think, thrice over from his hip down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
until all his pains were driven out at his toes ends, and
the man walkt luſtily to and fro in the Garden, profeſſing his
apprehenſions of being able to do ſo for 10 miles, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
thoſe Crutches one while in his hand, another while tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphingly
upon his ſhoulders, which had been his ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
thither. I might add hereunto ſome Soldiers names,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54889:36"/>
who came from the <hi>Tower,</hi> and out of the Guards, as well as
the Gunner <hi>Benjamin Huskins,</hi> and Ship-Carpenters and
others, who for lameneſs, deafneſs, and other infirmities, have
received benefit by his hand. <hi>Robert Furnace</hi> the noted
Tinker of <hi>Clerkenwel,</hi> his Cure is talked of all over the Town:
the Crutches on which he came to Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> (and he had
not been able to walk without Crutches for 8 years laſt paſt')
he brought in his hand and preſented to me, after he had
been ſtrok'd three or four times, and found himſelf thereby
enabled to walk without them. I may not here omit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you, that the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> being ſometime
preſent when this poor man was under Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> hands,
by the application whereof his pains being diſlodged out of
his hip and driven downwards to his knee, that noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
deſcended to ſtroke the Tinkers knee, leg and foot with
the inſide of Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> glove, and ſo proceeded to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
his pains from place to place until they fled quite out at
the ends of his Toes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margery,</hi> the Wife of the above named Tinker, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> hand to her breaſt, ſides, and
bowels, was freed from an Ague, which flew (as ſhe ſaid)
firſt to her throat, next out at her mouth, making her tongue
and lips extraordinary cold in its paſſage, which were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to be ſo by ſome other perſons as well as my ſelf.
I have felt the tongues of divers others wonderfully cold,
when their Ptyſicks, or other pains, have given place to his
hand, and paſſed away out at their mouths. <hi>John Hayes</hi>
Servant to Doctor <hi>Worley,</hi> troubled for many years with
ſtoppage of ſtomack, and ſhortneſs of breathing, being ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
upon his breaſt and ſtomack, voided wind upwards in
abundance, inſomuch as he feared to be choked with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of it; but when that belching ceaſed, and his tongue
(which was then as cold as ice) had been touched by one of
Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> fingers, he profeſſed himſelf to be very well,
and freed (as he conceived) of his former diſtempers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anne Roſe</hi> a Widow in the <hi>Minories,</hi> troubled with a head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54889:37"/>
for twenty years ſo grievous, for the moſt part, by her
relation, as no tongue was able to expreſs it, whereby
her life was become a burthen to her; upon Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi>
his laying his hand on her head, and gently rubbing it, the
pains removed thence into her breaſt and ſtomack, and made
her wondrous faint and ſick; but thoſe parts being ſtroked,
ſhe was immediately put into a tedious fit of belching, which
continued the ſpace of an hour or upwards, and that being
over, ſhe expreſſed her ſelf to find more eaſe than ſhe had
done of 20 years before, and that ſhe was then void of all
pain, to her unſpeakable joy and comfort. It would be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to reckon up what I have ſeen in this kind, and hold it
more adviſeable to break off here, than to proceed in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you a further trouble.</p>
               <p>Colonel <hi>Henry Sibthorp,</hi> aged ſeventy and eight years or
thereabouts, ſo deaf that his Servants and others were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſhout to him, had the hearing of one ear ſo perfectly
reſtored, that he could hear any low word or ſound, by the
only application of Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> hand to his head, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his fingers into the old Gentlemans ears, wherein I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
the like happening daily to younger perſons.</p>
               <p>I had the honour to be preſent at the experiment made
by the Right Honourable the Lord Viſcount <hi>Falconbridge,</hi>
upon <hi>John Jacomb</hi> of <hi>George</hi>-Alley in <hi>Southwark,</hi> whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
and continual pains, by the gentle touch and eaſie fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> hand, were allured out of his arm
and ſhoulder to the extreme joints and ends of his fingers,
which became thereby (as the man affirmed) devoid of
ſenſe, benummed and deaded: Whereupon his Lordſhip
thruſt a pin of about an inch long almoſt to the head, into
one of his fingers, his eyes firſt cloſe covered, without the
leaſt ſign of the mans perception, or any blood appearing
when the pin was pulled out: he then thruſt it into another
finger, as deep as the firſt, and askt the man if he felt nothing,
who made anſwer, that he could not tell; but after a little
pauſe, ſaid he thought he did; whereat my Lord admiring,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54889:37"/>
pulled it out again, and Mr <hi>Greatrak's</hi> ſlightly ſtroked the
mans fingers twice or thrice, who continued hoodwinkt;
afterwards the pins point only touching one of his fingers
ends, he ſmartly cryed out, Oh you prick me, &amp; blood imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
iſſued out of thoſe places into which the pin had been
thruſt: The man profeſſed himſelf freed of all pain, and
may be preſumed to have continued ſo, for as much as
he was bidden by Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> to come again if he felt the
leaſt grudging, with promiſe of eaſie acceſs to him, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of help and eaſe; but hath never appeared ſince.</p>
               <p>A like Experiment was tryed by the reverend Doctor
<hi>Wilkins,</hi> upon a Woman in my houſe, with ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
improvements; for when her pains, by Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi>
ſtroking, were brought into her fingers, and thoſe benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as the former, the Doctor indeavouring by rubbing and
pinching to reduce them to ſenſe and life; which when he
had continued a good while, he would have perſwaded the
poor woman that her fingers were freed and well, which
when ſhe complainingly denyed, he proceeded to prick her
fingers, but without her feeling, or blood following, until her
fingers were gently ſtroked, which reſtored them to ſenſe and
motion.</p>
               <p>I might add hereunto very many inſtances of the ſame
nature, but am unwilling to be tedious, and ſhall therefore
reſerve them to a freſh opportunity, together with a Liſt of
neer One hundred perſons names, who in my hearing have
profeſſed themſelves helped of various Diſtempers, by the
hands, urine, and ſpittle of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Greatrak's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall for the preſent conclude with obſerving to you, that
though his hand had little or none effect upon the Lady that
firſt brought me to him, yet have I often ſeen in meaner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
wonderful ſucceſs to enſue in the like caſe: as in <hi>Anne
Shelley, Jane Farrington,</hi> and <hi>Grace White:</hi> the laſt whereof
by reaſon of a Palſey on her left ſide, had been diſabled for
five years from walking without the ſupport of another, yet
after 4 or 5 times ſtroking, ſhe confeſſed ſhe had walkt two

               <p>UPon the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of this inſtant (being <hi>Wedneſday)</hi> I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a Purge, which by reaſon of a ſmall addition
more then I did formerly uſe to take, did work very violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the whole day, at leaſt 24 times. I could eat nothing that
day nor night, only drank a little Mace-ale. I reſted pretty
well that night; but when I roſe the next morning, I was
mightily griped in my ſtomach and bowels, with much pain
I went up and down an hour or two, and when nothing
would eaſe me, I reſolved to lye down and reſt my ſelf; and
going to take ſome reſt, a Friend meets me and perſwades me
to let Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> touch my ſtomach and bowels; which
I did conſent unto, (he being in my houſe the ſame time, for
he came the night before) and I obſerved when he firſt ſtrok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me I was immediately without pain, and went down from
my Chamber very well (as I thought) with intent to ſhew
ſome friends that came to ſee me what a ſudden change his
hand had wrought: But I had not been with my friends 6
minutes but I felt a ſudden change; for I had many qualms
in my ſtomach, which forc'd me to vomit very much, and I
was in a ſweat all over, and very ſick, and ſo continued half
an hour, when he came and ſtroked me again, which cauſed
me to vomit the ſecond time, and then I took a little reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my bed: but the pain in my ſtomach was ſo great that it
did awake me, and preſently I vomited the third time:
which Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> hearing (being in the next Room) came
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54889:38"/>
to me (I being exceeding ill) and ſaid, by the bleſſing of God
this will do you much good, I will ſtroke your head, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
and ſtomach once more, and I believe you will do very
well: which when he had done, I laid me down and reſted
well for an hour, and then came from my Chamber very
well, and went abroad with him all that afternoon. I have
one thing more only to adde, That I was in a great ſweat all
the time, and do believe and found moſt apparently, that
by the ſtroke of his hand all the ſharp matter which the
Purge had ſtirr'd, and could not carry away downwards,
was that which cauſed ſo much pain, and was brought away
by vomiting.</p>

ſtoppage at the ſtomack, inſomuch that I could not walk the
length of our Shop, or go up a pair of ſtairs without much
trouble, and many times have been fain to be helped to my
bed, and in foggy miſty weather I have been forced to be

of breath was ſo much, that when I went abroad I did reel
like a man in drink, that I was aſhamed of my ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and

Gods means done upon me, by the ſtroking of my

That being violently troubled with an exceſſive pain of the
head, that I had hardly ſlept ſix hours in ſix days and nights,
and taken but very little of ſuſtenance in that time; and that
being but touch'd by him, I immediately found eaſe, and
(thanks be to God) do continue very well; and do further
ſatisfie you, that the rigour of the pain had put me into a
high Fever, which immediately ceas'd with my head-ach:
and do likewiſe further inform you, that a Servant being
touch'd for the ſame pain, that had continu'd upon him for
twelve years laſt paſt, he touch'd him in the forehead, and
the pain went backward; and that but by his ſtroking upon
the outſide of his cloaths the pain came down to and out of
his foot: the party continues ſtill well. Theſe Cures were
wrought about 3 weeks before <hi>Eaſter.</hi> And thus much I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

that term (though I muſt confeſs as a Gentleman and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
all that he does are to be miraculouſly admired, in my
weak opinion.) Theſe perſons unſtripping both their boſoms,
he applies himſelf to his way of Curing, and told me in the
preſence of Sir <hi>Anthony Morgan,</hi> Mr. <hi>Starkey,</hi> and many other
ſtanders by, that he would bring the Pthyſick out of their
Stomachs into their Tongues, and that their Tongues ſhould
be as cold as Ice: which I and the reſt of the company found
to be true; for laying my finger upon their Tongues, I found
it to be true what he had ſaid; and away they went (after
his touching of their Tongues) well, and praiſing God.
Their Infirmities were ſo great, that in a manner they went
double in the breaſt.</p>

note (it was about three weeks ago) you by good Fortune
came to a Neighbours houſe of mine (Captain <hi>Wildy:)</hi> ſhe
being informed, having a great deſire was rather carried than
to ſay went that little way; but by the bleſſing of God
through your endeavours, that night ſhe came to meet me as

twice with you at <hi>Lincolns-Inn fields,</hi> and to the glory of
God and her comfort, I hope is freed from her pains. Sir,

I was taken with a great pain in my hip, about ſeven
years of age, which ſo continued till this preſent <hi>April,</hi> the
14. day, 1666. which is above 18 years: in which time there
have been many wayes ſought for help; I was once a patient
to Doctor <hi>Barker</hi> of <hi>Newbury</hi> in the County of <hi>Berks,</hi> very
eminent: I was alſo a patient to Doctor <hi>Pavie</hi> of the <hi>Deviſes</hi>

the advice of both theſe Doctors I went to the Bath, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſome eaſe, but the Spring following, the pain came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
upon which they judged it the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> and therefore
made Iſſues in my leg, but all to little effect, for my pain
ſtill continued; but when I was toucht by Mr. <hi>Greatrak's,</hi> my
pain went immediately out of my hip into my knee, which
put me to great pain, thence his touch removed it into my
anckle, and thence into my great toe, which cauſed it to
look very black, and with one more touch he cauſed it to
paſs under my nail, and ſo it went quite away; ſince which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54889:41"/>
I have been well, and have walked five miles in the City

Mr. <hi>Greatrak's,</hi> who (God be praiſed) in twice ſtroking cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me perfectly, three weeks ſince, ſo fully as I have not felt
the leaſt pain ſince: he ſtroked my head, and the pain flew
through my body into my knees, ſo violently that it made
me cry out with the extremity of the pain, and ſo removed
from place to place until I felt it no more: now if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

brake it after it had troubled me by its ſoreneſs for 2 or 3
hours, and my face on that ſide did change its hue formerly
being ebullient in many places; from his ſtroke the diſeaſe

it with his cold hand (an improbable means, as moſt do think)
he by this motion of his hand did produce ſuch a heat, as
did burn up all the pain: but at this and the other times he
ſtroked me, I had ſuch a ſickneſs upon me as men have when
they are about to vomit, and one time I vomited an acid
frothy matter with ſome indigeſted Flegme. After this, <hi>viz.</hi>
on <hi>Eaſter</hi> Monday, I found ſome of this humour ſteal into
my Right leg, and was ſtroked there, and it vaniſhed, having
ſome remembrance of my former ſickneſs in my ſtomack.
When my ſelf or any one elſe did tell him of the eaſe they
received, I heard no vaunt in his language, but joyfully he
ſaid, either <hi>Praiſed be God,</hi> or <hi>The glory be to God;</hi> and when

               <p>IN my laſt I promiſed to give you an Account of what I had
ſeen that Man of wonders do, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Valentine Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak's.</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:54889:47"/>
I did likewiſe promiſe to give the ſame Account to
my Honourable Friends, the Honourable <hi>Robert Boyle,</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Dickinſon;</hi> but being ſtraited in time I deſire you to
ſhow them this, and in my behalf to beg their excuſe.</p>
               <p>In acute pains whereſoever ſeated, the perſons upon his
ſtroking have for the moſt part confeſſed a momentary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
and that which often cauſed my admiration, I have
ſeen a pain move from the left ſhoulder to the right foot,
and then ſtroked out of the toes: when fix'd there, they have
cried out with extremity of pain, till relieved by his hand.
I ſaw a young woman well habited, who complained of a
pain in her head that was Chronical; Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Greatrak's</hi> gently
ſtroked her head, and it came into her eyes, afterwards into
her noſe and mouth, then into her ſtomach: The woman
grew very ſick, ſo that ſhe ſwounded away; the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
her imagin'd ſhe would have dyed: Upon ſtroking her
ſtomach it flew into her throat, ready to ſtrangle her, then
into her eyes, ſo that both ſight and ſpeech were taken from
her. He continued ſtroking from place to place till ſhe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
her ſenſes, and declared before thoſe preſent ſhe was
freed from pain. I have ſeen ſeveral of the ſame nature,
though not ſo extreme, freed by him during the time they
were with him. I have heard thoſe who have been deaf for
many years, declare, after he had rubb'd their heads, and
put his fingers in their ears, that they have heard diſtinctly;
nay ſome I have gone to, and have ſpoke to them with no
high voice, and they have made ready Anſwers to Questions
not vulgar. I ſaw a Child aged about 12. that had not
ſtirr'd hand nor foot for 14 weeks together; ſhe had neer 20
ſcrophulous tumours in her arms, thighs, legs, and throat.
Out of one large one in her leg, near the ſhin-bone he made
a ſmall orifice, and took out divers kernels; thoſe that were
hard, by his handling tended to ſuppuration: After twice
ſtroking this Child walked up hill 60 yards or more: Thoſe
ſores that ran, dried up after his ſpitting upon them. I can
the more boldly atteſt this, by reaſon the Mother of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54889:47"/>
Child through the interceſſion of a friend of mine to me,
by my intereſt gain'd acceſs to have her Child touched by
him. Thoſe who have had <hi>Iſchiaticas</hi> or Hip-gouts, I have
ſeen go away freed from all pain. I ſaw a man aged above
30, who had the Kings-Evil, by reaſon whereof he had not
ſtood upright for 3 years, his back-bone through weakneſs
diſtended 2 or 3 inches, when without his Crutch he could
not walk about a room without reſting his hands upon his
knees: he had two Fiſtulas upon the left <hi>muſculus ſacrolumbi,</hi>
great inflammation being upon the parts adjoyning, with
grievous pain. After Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> had ſtroked him a while,
the pain was quite taken away, and he walked upright ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times about the room. A little above the <hi>Carpus</hi> of the
right wriſt was 2 tumours as big as tennis-balls, no way
tending to any ſuppuration; yet ſaith Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> to a
Perſon of Quality then preſent, if I do not open it, his arm
will rot off: with that taking his Lance, he makes a ſmall
orifice, and with a little compreſſing the part there flies out
hundreds of ſmall bodies, ſome as big as French-beans; I
could liken them to nothing ſo fitly as to Cocks-ſtones; for
they much reſembled them in all points: they flew out like
to a ſhower of hail, with a windy ſtink. He had likewiſe a
tumour of the ſame nature in the muſcle or brawn of the
thumb; he opened that, there came out ſome of the ſame
kernels, and I could perfectly diſcern that the part of the
brawn of the thumb was converted into thoſe Anomalcus
bodies; but whence or by what juice this ſtrange tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould be made, I leave to others more learned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into.</p>
               <p>I likewiſe ſaw a man who could not move his hand, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thinking dead, Mr. <hi>Greatrak's</hi> gently ſtroked him,
and he moved his hand as well as I could mine, and with
great acclamations gave thanks to God. I forbear to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with any more, for if I ſhould relate all I have
ſeen, ſeveral ſheets would not contain it: I have declared
what I was an Eye-witneſs too, but whether the perſons that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54889:48"/>
have received that immediate relief continue well, I cannot
inform you at preſent; but perhaps hereafter I may tell you
my thoughts, why many (as it is reported) relapſe. Having
oft had the opportunity of being in his company, with ſome
perſons of no ordinary quality, I am the better able to give
a Character of him. I find him to be a perſon of a brave,
gentile humour, of a free carriage and diſpoſition; one as
being not over-preciſe to be termed a Zelot, ſo not of ſo large
a latitude as to deſerve that of a debauched perſon, which
ſome in the world have undeſervedly given him: for I have
dined ſeveral times where he hath been, and I never obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
other but great moderation, both as to eating and
drinking; nor did I ever hear him ſwear, or ſee him paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
although cauſe ſufficient hath been given in my
hearing, to move a perſon not indued with a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
patience. I hope, Dear Friend, you are ſo aſſured of
my reality, that nothing could induce me to this, were I not
ſo great an Aſſertor and Vindicator of Truth, let it tend ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo much to my diſadvantage: I take leave and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,</p>
