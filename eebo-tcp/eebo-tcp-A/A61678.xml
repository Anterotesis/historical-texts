            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Fools</hi> are denominatives <hi>re &amp; voce,</hi> the name and quality of the one, deriv'd from the other; every <hi>fool</hi> ſo call'd by his <hi>folly,</hi> and all <hi>folly</hi> the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>fools,</hi> and the meaning of this quality, <hi>wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> the <hi>Wiſemans fool</hi> here is a <hi>wicked man;</hi> he that knows not this, may very well be both. So 'twas in his Father <hi>David</hi>'s language too, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>The fool that ſaid in his heart, There was no God,</hi> is preſently expreſt by <hi>corrupt and abominable works.</hi> And in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s likewiſe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. the <hi>diſobedient</hi> and <hi>ſlaves to luſt</hi> and <hi>malicious,</hi> &amp;c. are all prefac't by <hi>[fools]; We our ſelves were alſo fooliſh and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now if <hi>folly</hi> be <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>fools ſinners,</hi> the words afford us theſe two parts, a Suppoſition, and a Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A Suppoſition in the denomination of the ſubject, <hi>Sin is folly, and ſinners are fools.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Suppoſition, that <hi>ſin is folly, and ſinners fools,</hi> would afford us ample meditation for this time: but becauſe <hi>Deceit</hi> is a cauſal attribute unto <hi>ſin,</hi> and antecedent to <hi>folly;</hi> our firſt Parents being firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd themſelves, before they became <hi>fools</hi> or <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and convey'd that appellation to poſterity; <hi>Deceit</hi> therefore ſhall firſt ſtep forth, leading <hi>Sin</hi> in her hand: <hi>Sin is deceit, and ſinners are deceiv'd,</hi> that's our Obſervation.</p>

So ſpeaks Divine Wiſdom here, and 'tis ſeconded with Humane: <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Leſt wickedneſs ſhould alier his underſtanding, and deceit beguile his ſoul.</hi> Wickedneſs and Deceit are ſo intrinſecal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate one with another, as they ſerve mutually to expreſs each other: or, if you would rather that the Divine voice ſhould eccho to its ſelf again, ye may have it in the fore-mentioned of <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 3. where the <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>diſobedient</hi> are rendred alſo <hi>deceived; We our ſelves were ſometimes fooliſh and diſobedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>ſervice of luſts</hi> ſet off with <hi>deceit.</hi>

Which divination of the Fathers, I am the more inclinable unto, as moſt probable, by comparing with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 32, 33. ver. where giving the ſame Caveat, <hi>Be not deceived,</hi> he preſently infers, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die;</hi> which being a Principle once brought to communication, was evill and deceitful, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted good manners. But this Principle being not, as I hope, familiar in the thoughts and practiſes of men of our times, I ſhall not inſiſt upon, nor yet others leading unto ſin more generally; my whole buſineſs therefore ſhall be at this time, to evince the deceit of ſuch Principles or Reaſonings only as have deceived the Fooliſh and Diſobedient of our late diſmal Times, when as <hi>wickedneſs broke out like fire,</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> phraſe, Ch. 9. 18. and devoured not only the ſhrubs and Cedars of our <hi>Lebanon,</hi> but even the Royal Oak himſelf.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51256:7"/>
poſſibly by the ſame deceitfulneſſe of mens thoughts through ſuch dangerous Principles, which are ſhrewdly ſuſpected to lye latent in the hearts of diſcontented parties, as may ſeem by the daily jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of plotts and rumours of plotts: how true though I leave to Authority to find out, yet not knowing how to conceal my fears, have made it my work for the remainder of my hour to retexe the fallacies, or miſtakes of moſt of their deſtructive reaſonings, leſt wickedneſs ſhould afreſh conceive, and pregnate, and break forth, and bring forth more <hi>ſwords,</hi> and <hi>fire-brands</hi> amongſt us. Wherein, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I cannot but preface this ſerious proteſtation that I mean not any upbraidment or inſulting over mens weakneſſes, or ignorances; but to convince their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and tender the good of their Souls, as well as the ſafety of our dear and precious King and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To proceed then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt falſe poſition, or principle of deceit whereby Wickedneſſe hath been much heightned, and improv'd, and may be again, is good Meanings, or good Intentions, as you may remember that ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of the Law, who prepared for the Kings Tryal<note place="margin">Cook.</note> and Murder: ſaid at his Execution, <hi>he had good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;</hi> And ſo may we believe of thoſe laſt vile, ignorant, and publick <hi>Murtherers,</hi> who pretended that their buſineſſe was to prepare the way for the coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>his Kingdome;</hi> Thus if men have caught but a good Meaning by the end, as, <hi>for the Glory of God,</hi> the reformation of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> the ſuppreſſion of <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> or the like, they think that then their actions are lawful and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51256:7"/>
though never ſo croſs to the Laws both of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuch men I deſire to take notice of that good meaning, <hi>John</hi> 16. 2. Where Chriſt foretold, <hi>That ſome ſhould murther his Apoſtles with a thought of doing God ſervice.</hi> See what a fair meaning here was in a moſt ugly helliſh Sin! Could that meaning think you excuſe them? Let them obſerve alſo the meaning of St. <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 16. 22. Where ye may read, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>would by no means conſent that his Maſter ſhould dye:</hi> this was ſeemingly as fair a good meaning as can be imagin'd, for an honeſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Servant to wiſh the life, and well-being of his dear good Maſter; But, mark ye, the Devil himſelf could not have wiſht us a greater miſchief than that Chriſt ſhould not have dyed, for then we and all the World beſides had been damn'd in Hell. What a monſtrous wicked good meaning was this; Chriſt calling his chief Diſciple Devil-for't? And let them conſider one good Meaning more, to wit, of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who crucified the Lord of Life, under a good meaning of zeal for the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and their antient cuſtomes, <hi>Sub zelo legis odium latebat Legiſlatoris,</hi> Here was the greateſt wickedneſſe that ever was acted in the World, carryed on, under a good meaning for the Law.</p>
            <p>Now this being well remarked, I would aſke of all thoſe who were guilty of the late <hi>Defection,</hi> or rather <hi>Rebellion</hi> indeed (for howſoever policy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it with a term of <hi>indulgence,</hi> and calls it only <hi>inconvenience,</hi> yet the Pulpit may not ſo, we are bid <hi>Cry aloud and ſpare not, and lift up our voices</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51256:8"/>
               <hi>like Trumpets, aud tell the Houſe of Juda their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsions, and Iſrael their ſins:</hi> Which we cannot do unleſſe we call every thing by it's own diſtinctive name, a spade a spade, Rebellion Rebellion, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell a Rebell; except thoſe in whom the Grace of Repentance is viſible by their contrary actings and retractations (for all whom there is both joy in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that, and honour alſo upon earth): but as for others who retain their old guilt before God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never repented their abominations, but nouriſh their old principles of impiety under phanſied good meaning ſo as to be ready to act over the ſame wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe again; of thoſe I ſay I would demand; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they had liv'd in the time of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and had concurr'd with them to the murthering of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles with the ſame good meanings alſo that the <hi>Jews</hi> had, whether they could think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any whit excuſable by thoſe good meanings more then the <hi>Jews?</hi> if not (as we are ſure, they can not, they having equally concurr'd in the ſinne, by the ſuppoſition, and therefore are equally lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in guilt, for which the <hi>Jews</hi> are puniſht in their poſterity to this day) the queſtion then will be, How; or why, they ſhould conceive themſelves <hi>excuſable,</hi> or <hi>juſtifiable</hi> by their good meanings now, in or after the commiſſion of ſuch horrible iniquities as <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth bluſh at,</hi> being in their whole latitude of <hi>circumſtantial aggravations</hi> of as great, or rather greater criminableneſs than the <hi>crucifixion of Chriſt himſelf</hi> (ſetting aſide the diſproportion of the Object as <hi>Chriſt was God,</hi> and therein infinite) and more intenſely, and accumulately wronged? What?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51256:8"/>
Can it enter the heart of any knowing Chriſtian to believe, that ſo ſleight a thing as <hi>good meanings</hi> ſhould juſtifie ſuch abominations, as all the Miſeries and Impieties of a voluntary; unnatural, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious War, which ſwept away Myriads of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Chriſtians, and good Subjects, and afterwards One, like <hi>David,</hi> worth ten or a 100000 thouſand of them, the dear and precious anointed of the Lord himſelf?</p>
            <p>No, beloved, <hi>good meanings</hi> avail nothing, in ſuch prodigious Wickedneſs at leaſt: Though a <hi>bad meaning</hi> may make a <hi>good action bad;</hi> yet, <hi>good meanings</hi> can never make a <hi>bad action, good Quid, furemur divitibus ut demus pauperibus?</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Shall we ſteal from the Rich to give unto the Poor? There's a Meaning good enough, but a Means every whit as bad. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore teacheth us better, As there muſt be <hi>Charitas in intentione;</hi> ſo there muſt be <hi>Veritas in electione,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>A choice of true and proper means, for every true and genuine end.</hi> Becauſe we creatures are not immediate and complicate with our end, as God is, who himſelf is his own End; but we are at a diſtance from our end, and therefore muſt conſult and deliberate upon the choice of our means in order thereunto, which are moſt proper, ſuitable, and lawful for attainment: He that thinks, in the uſe of unlawful means or actions, with them to attain the ſcope of righteouſneſs, and happineſs therewith, is like one, as a late Writer wittily ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milizeth, That rowles himſelf upon a bed of thorns to ſleep eaſily; or, that ſets his face to the Eaſt to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51256:9"/>
go to bed with the Sun in the Weſt; which are meer impoſſibilities and repugnances. Beloved, <hi>Good works</hi> will be in heaven, to the eternal glory of their Author; when as <hi>evill works,</hi> for all their <hi>good meanings,</hi> will be in hell, without Repentance, to the eternal ſhame of their Actors. To conclude this, as he cannot well be thought to mean <hi>ill,</hi> who doeth <hi>well;</hi> ſo, nor he likely ſo much as to mean <hi>well,</hi> who reſolves and continues to do <hi>ill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, my brethren, ſince good meanings are ſo ſleight an excuſe for wicked actions, no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the ignorance of the Law, whence they proceed, and juſtifies no man; let all thoſe that have followed the ſin of <hi>Jeroboam the ſon of Nebat, who made Iſrael to ſin,</hi> not only <hi>in the calves of Bethel,</hi> but alſo <hi>in dividing from the Crown of Juda;</hi> let them all ſeriouſly bethink themſelves, and repent betwixt God and their ſouls, and ſtrive to become pricked in their hearts with remorſe, as were the <hi>Jews,</hi> notwithſtanding all their good meanings, leſt, under the ſecurity they have by the indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty temporal of their Lives and Eſtates, they hazzard the ſalvation of their ſouls, being no power tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary can indemnifie a ſoul.</p>
            <p>And let all ſuch beware further, who are ſtill feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the old leaven of Malice and Wickedneſs, whereby they nouriſh unto themſelves diſcontents and murmurings in their Tents againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> becauſe they are whipt a little while longer with the rods of their own making, and ſtung with the tails of thoſe Scorpions hatcht by their own Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice Eggs: Let them, I ſay, beware how they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51256:9"/>
upon ſuch odious and perilous actions again, under a conceit of <hi>doing lawfully by their good Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;</hi> for, believe it, they will prove no better then that in <hi>Daniel, Mene mene tekel upharzin:</hi> being weighed, they'l be found too light, when the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of judgement is upon the wall againſt them.</p>
            <p>A ſecond deceitful Principle is, <hi>Following a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly party;</hi> whereof I take occaſion to ſpeak, from a paſſage of mine own experience; for being conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted once in point of conſcience, by a perſon of a conſiderable quality, a little after the beginning of the late Miſeries, Whether he might lawfully and with a ſafe conſcience, take one of the Rebellious Oaths or Proteſtations? And I having anſwered him in the Negative, that he might not do it with a ſafe conſcience; He replyed, <hi>That he would hold with the godly and praying Party;</hi> and ſo took it. And indeed this was the vulgar Error of <hi>England,</hi> at that time, to follow thoſe who had the moſt plauſible ſhews of godlineſs in outward appearance beyond others, and by advantage thereof, gave the Conduct and Clarigation to the fatal War.</p>
            <p>Now to this I ſhall diſcourſe, that however Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be indeed the beſt practiſe in the world, and to follow a Godly or Religious party, be the beſt alſo for a mans imitation, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> all things equally conſidered, <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul;</hi> but nevertheleſs, without much heedfulneſs and circumſpection, there may be great deceit in it.</p>
            <p>For firſt, I would know of ſuch people, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> are apt to be taken with this reaſoning, What
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51256:10"/>
Godly party it is they would fain follow? If they mean, by the Godly party, ſuch as place their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in Whimzies, and Humors, and Singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Curioſities, and Phanſies, and Affectari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in Mimick mouths, and Antick faces, in Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting phraſes, and Affected Graces, in Twinckling of the eyes, and Ronching of the noſe, in long Prayer, and ſhort hair, which ye know was the guiſe before the Troubles; though now, tis but the character of a Quaker, or ſcarſe that; in flaſhes of Zeal, and mazes of the Spirit, in length and quantity, rather than in quality and perfection of Duty, in rude anhelous pantings, and interrupt breathings at Devotion, in paſſionate interjections, and extempore imperfections, and as many <hi>Ah Lord</hi>'s, as the Papiſts have <hi>Ah Lady</hi>'s at their <hi>Ave Maries;</hi> in outſide auſterity and abſtinence from Indifferencies; as, from the Lot in Recreation, and from Ceremony in Religion; in taking down a ſtone-baſon, and ſetting up a pewter-baſon; or, taking it from the Church door, and ſetting it at the Miniſters Pew door; in taking down a Saint-holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and ſetting up a Parliament-holyday; in ceaſing to feaſt for the Birth of Chriſt, and feaſting rather for the dea h of Chriſtians, and many ſuch like. If ſuch be the Godly Party, whom any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would follow, we all know that this is the Party who have deceived this poor Church and Nation, into all the miſchief and ruine it hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: this is a Godly Party with an amuſement, enough to make Religion and Godlineſs it ſelf ridiculous and contemptible, in the obſervation of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51256:10"/>
wiſe and indifferent men, even <hi>Pagans</hi> themſelves; and therefore, to follow ſuch a Godly Party muſt needs be <hi>deceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Put caſe the Godly Party, to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> were the moſt wiſe and regular Church-Society; yet, to follow them ſo, as to make a total reſignation unto them of our Faith and Reaſon, Conſciences and Affections, as the Community of the people did unto the Long-Parliament, this alſo muſt needs be a <hi>deceit;</hi> becauſe the ſpirit of Error is apt to inſinuate and creep into the beſt Societies of men in the World. <hi>Fas ergo eſt aliquà, Coeleſtia pectora fatli.</hi> There was folly found in the Angels, and chaffe in the firſt floor Chriſt ever lay'd, which if he with his fan inhis hand, had not purged out of their hearts, Satan himſelf would have winow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them as wheat. So ſhall you ſee the cleereſt ſtreams, ſtained with a vein of puddle; the pureſt pupil moated; the moſt radiant Stars dimmed with the ſteams of Terrene vapors; ſo the moſt eminent in place of action found of Error; the very Pillars of the Church ſometimes chinckt in with ſome ſtones of offence. <hi>Errare p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

for St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> were at a contradiction, and both parties could not have the right; and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were at a contention. <hi>The Spirit of truth ſhall guide you into all truth,</hi> was the Promiſe of Chriſt; He that ſaid it, is as true as his Word, but well underſtood, not in the whole circumference of the Terms, but in the limitation of the Senſe; <hi>All truths fundamental, the eſſential conſtituents of a Church,</hi> the Spirit of Chriſt hath promiſed to lead his Church into. And ſo he doth, for the Church is the Pillar of Truth, and the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure; but as for other truth's of analogie, inference and remote conſequence, that like backer houſes, ſhew not at firſt ſight, in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of faith; into ſuch truth's as theſe, the Spirit of Truth, hath not promiſed to lead us: but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leaves us to the ſpirit of Error, who does his beſt to do his worſt, and deceive thoſe that believe. Inſtance whereof you may take in the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church of Chriſtendom, this of <hi>England,</hi> whom the old Dragon, according to his uſe of perſecuting the Woman into the Wilderneſs, hath endeavoured to bring (in our late dayes of Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) into contempt and diſgrace, in the view of the whole World; and to that end had inſinuated ſuch miſchievous Deluſions, into the two chief Parties of her moſt conſiderable intereſt, after once divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as the moſt remarkable in their own thoughts, and their Diſciples admiration; for ſtrictneſs and ſeverity of life, were groſly miſled into the fouleſt miſcarriage imaginable, as to their Politicks in the caſe of Subjection &amp; Government. On the other ſide,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51256:11"/>
they which were moſt regular and beſt principled in underſtanding of Government and Learning, were not altogether, ſome of them, in mens obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſo perfect in their Morals as they ſhould have been; and therefore, to conclude, in both reſpects aforeſaid, to follow a Godly Party may be <hi>deceitful,</hi> although <hi>caeteris paribas,</hi> all things equally conſidered, A Godly party, eſpecially truly godly, is beſt imitable with Wiſdom and Circumſpection, but not ſimply and abſolutely. So much for the ſecond deceitful Reaſoning whereby Wickedneſs hath been much improved.</p>
            <p>A third Principle of <hi>deceit,</hi> whereby wickedneſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> doth much impregnate, is <hi>a reaſoning from contraries;</hi> as in caſe ſome perſon or perſons do act wickedly in their way, that therefore others acting the quite contrary, ſhall be allowed and warranted as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in what they do, becauſe <hi>contrary.</hi> Which ſeems indeed to carry ſome reaſonableneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability with it, it being backt with a ſhew of Logick, <hi>Contrariorum contraria ſunt conſequentia,</hi> Of contraries there are contrary conſequences. And ſo in Phyſick, <hi>Contraria contrariis curantur,</hi> Evils in mens bodies are remedied by their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And in Philoſophy likewiſe, <hi>Contraria mutuò ſe pellunt,</hi> Contraries expel one the other. But nevertheleſs, this kind of Reaſoning is moſt <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> without wary diſtinguiſhing.</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe we muſt diſtinguiſh; there is <hi>a contrariety natural,</hi> and <hi>contrariety moral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>contrariety natural,</hi> is firſt betwixt the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as Fire and Water, which are mutually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51256:12"/>
one of the other; and much like are the extreams of Virtue, as Avarice and Prodigality, to inſtance in no more, which are as inconſiſtent and expellent of each other, as Fire and Water, and therefore I call them <hi>Contraries natural;</hi> for though as they ſtand in oppoſition to the mean which is Virtue, they are <hi>morally contrary;</hi> yet as in contra-diſtinction of one to the other, they are but <hi>natural Contraries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is alſo another contrariety called <hi>moral,</hi> as before; that is, betwixt the Extreams and the Mean, <hi>alias</hi> Virtue, which I call <hi>Contraries</hi> being oppoſite, as Good and Evill <hi>moral,</hi> they differing as much as Wiſdom and Folly, which we all know to be <hi>contrary;</hi> the mean, which is Virtue, being acted by Wiſdom, according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his his <hi>Ethicks,</hi>

            <p>(ſaith the Poet) The declining of one Vice incurs another, if done without Prudence, which governs all virtuous actions; howbeit to decline one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariy in a moral ſenſe, and turn to the other; that is, from Vice to Virture, from Evill to Good, from Sin to Righteouſneſs, is a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal

            <p>A fourth deceitful Principle of wickedneſs, whence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> vain workers of iniquity reaſon to themſelves the lawfulneſſe of their vileſt practices, is, Succeſſe in them. Becauſe their actions though never ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, and abominable, do nevertheleſſe proſper, and take effect according to their deſires; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, 'Twas Gods will and pleaſure ſo to have them come to paſſe, and thereby they war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and applaud themſelves as inſtruments of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods purpoſes, and giving iſſue to his providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Decrees forſooth, as the only ſervants of the moſt High.

the very <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves from the ſame Argument may plead the cauſe of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and juſtify their Tyranny, and Uſurpation over half the World al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; and ſo ye know had Popery ſpread over all Chriſtendome for many hundred years, and is yet ſucceſsfull over a great part thereof: Yea ſin it ſelf after it had once entred, prevailed over al the World; which I hope no man will be ſo wretched as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to God as the Author thereof, howbeit it had ſucceſſe enough as to it ſelf as well as Mahometiſm and Popery.

Divells, Men had as good follow thoſe ſpirits the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> ſpeaks of in the forementioned Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, oppoſitely unto the Law, and the Teſtimonie: Spirits that peep and mutter, that is, ſpirits of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and wizards, with whom it may be doubted that theſe ſpirit-people are too familiar.

            <p>Which two words of the Apoſtle <hi>[Letter</hi> and <hi>Spirit]</hi> minde me of the Appendix mentioned in the Dedication; Letter and Spirit having in the terms, a very fair connection with the literal and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſenſe of Scripture; whereby, notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid againſt the blinde motion and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51256:18"/>
impulſe of a Spirit, ſome Miſtakers conceiving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſer and more defenſible than the former, do warrant themſelves in their wicked actions, not only in Politicks, but Morals alſo, from the ſenſe and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual meaning of the Word of God itſelf; as if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conviction, by the former Reaſoning, what they may not do by a bare impulſe or motion, they may nevertheleſs do in their thoughts by a ſpiritual mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the written Word, the rule whereof they ſeem not to refuſe. But this alſo, Beloved, is a very fallacious imagination, which I ſhall deſire to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe by way of reducibleneſſe as an Appendix unto the great deceit of Conduct by the Spirit laſt confuted; and to that purpoſe do obſerve that a ſpiritual Meaning or ſenſe of Scripture oppoſite unto, or diverſe from, the ſenſe of the Letter, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſtructive, and deceptive of fooliſh ſinners, ſuch as St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls <hi>unſtable and unlearned,</hi> ſuch as are apt to wreſt the Scriptures, not only to their own, but others deſtruction alſo, even whole Churches, Nations, and Kingdoms, as well Kings as their People; may whereof there are, who taking upon them a boldneſs, through this perſwaſion, to wave the ſenſe of the Letter of the written Word, where the Commands of God agree not to their humours, engagements, and inclinations, they adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſenſe the text only to their own thoughts and purpoſes, though never ſo contrary to the moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous laws both of God and Man; and, in a policy of avoiding diſcovery herein (it ſounding harſh unto the moſt ingenuous ſort of Chriſtians, that the plain meaning of the World ſhould be ſlighted and baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled)
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51256:19"/>
they boaſt moſt of all in their Spiritual Light, of an eaſie and clear underſtanding, and thereafter expound it of the moſt myſterious hidden and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate places of the whole book of God, as the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and other the dark Prophetical paſſages, which neither Time nor Learning hath yet ſufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridled or unclaſped; and in theſe they oſtentate a familiar, though wonderful, Knowledge; becauſe they would be the readyer believed by fooliſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers in their abuſings and wreſtings of the plainer letter of other Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Now, beloved, this fallacious Reaſoning grounds upon a miſtaken underſtanding of ſome texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, where you ſhall read an oppoſition betwixt the <hi>Letter</hi> and the <hi>Spirit.</hi> As</p>
            <p>Firſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Who hath made us able Miniſters, not of the Letter only, but alſo of the Spirit.</hi> Therefore ſay they, There is a Litteral and a Spiritual ſenſe of the New Teſtament. But how falſe that conſequence is, may appear by obſerving, that the word <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Meaning,</hi> is not in the text read, nor in the whole context; but only <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Miniſtry or Miniſtration of the New Teſtament or Goſpel, there is the Letter or bare Word ſpoken, and the Spirit of Grace that quickneth or giveth life unto the Letter or Word ſpoken or written, making it fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and effectual, opening the minde to receive it, and working the heart and affections to ſubmit unto it; which puts the great difference betwixt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and the Law, the Law being only a bare or dead Letter engraven in ſtony tables, without any aſſiſtance of the Spirit of Grace to quicken it, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51256:19"/>
ſo the miniſtration thereof is of death and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto all mankind that hear it, there being no promiſe or concurrence of ſpirit with it to work it upon the heart unto obedience: man under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Law being left to his own ſelf, and ſtrength, which was become utter weakneſſe through the corruption of the fleſh, and unable to perform; whereas the Covenant of Grace, or the Goſpel hath the promiſe or aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, to work the Heavenly words of life upon the Soul or Spirit of the hearers unto Life and Righteouſneſſe; not by whiſpering or privately inſinuating, or inſufing any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe or meaning above or diverſe from the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: but by ſeconding, &amp; backing the ſame meaning of the words imported in the letter with power and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, whereupon I inferr that by Spirit here as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Letter is not meant an oppoſition of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſenſe in the Goſpell, or any other part of Gods word different or above the ſenſe of the Letter, but only a lively concurrence of the Spirit of Grace with the ordinance of Gods word, in the Letter of the words clauſes, and propoſitions of it, to make it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual in the hearts of the hearers for their Salvation, without which work of the Spirit, the Goſpel it ſelf would be as dead and killing a letter as the very Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another oppoſition of Letter and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. the three laſt verſes, about the <hi>Jew</hi> and one of his Marks, and Cognizances; viz. <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> which the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth <hi>into outward and inward,</hi> or in <hi>the fleſh,</hi> or in <hi>the heart and ſpirit</hi> verſe the laſt, reſembling the outward circumciſion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51256:20"/>
in oppoſition to circumciſion that is <hi>inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> of the heart, by the terme or ſimily of a Letter which whether one or more in the compoſition of a word pronounced or written, is but the mere out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of that word compared with its ſenſe and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and ſo it may well be put to reſemble the outward circumciſion of the fleſh, as contrary to the inward or ſpiritual circumciſion of the heart; or as the bare empty Letter of the Law is contrary to the quickning ſpirit of the Goſpel, as dead to living, or old to new. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. But from thence to reaſon a double and contrary ſenſe or ſignification, the one Literal the other ſpiritual, either of the words of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Circumciſion it ſelf, which expreſſely declares both Myſtery and Ceremony, or outward and inward of that Ordinance, or of any other text of Scripture, is a moſt fallacious and pittiful non concludence; Circumciſion is outward and inward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by the oppoſition of Letter and Spirit, therefore there are two different ſenſes in Scriptures, Literal, and Spiritual of the ſame words or ſentence, is a moſt abſurd conſequence.</p>
            <p>The third Text, occaſioning this deception, is, <hi>John</hi> 6. 63. <hi>My words,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>are ſpirit, the words that I ſpeak they are Spirit, and they are life,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſay the miſtakers, Chriſts words muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſpiritually, or in a ſpirituall ſenſe not lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall. Nay, but my Brethren what an inconſequence is this? For what were the words that Chriſt then ſpake, they were verſe 53, 54, 56. of <hi>eating his fleſh, and drinking his bloud</hi> in order to eternall life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the myſtery whereof they not underſtanding becauſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51256:20"/>
he ſpake in a figure, he explaines himſelf in the verſe mentioned by a diſtinction of fleſh and ſpirit, the fleſh profiteth nothing, ſaith he, but the ſpirit quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and my words are ſpirit; as if he had ſaid, think not therefore, that I mean you ſhould eat my fleſh, and drink my bloud, after a carnal or corporal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for that would not profit you, <hi>The fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth not;</hi> but feed upon me in communion with my ſpirit by faith, <hi>and ſo ſhall ye be quickened unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life.</hi> 'Tis a ſpiritual eating of my fleſh that my words mean, <hi>my words are ſpirit.</hi> But neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe beloved) not to be underſtood of a diverſe or contrary meaning from the Letter, for the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as of all Scripture, ſo of this, is twofold, <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Tropical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>Proper,</hi> which expreſſeth the thing by a word ſignifying, a meaning plainly anſwering the nature of the thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly <hi>Tropicall,</hi> which expreſſeth the thing by way of alluſion, or ſimilitude, or types and parables, converſively putting a word of ſimilitude or parable, for a word proper to the nature of the thing it ſelf; Now the eating Chriſt ſpeaks of here, is not proper of fleſhly eating, but in the Trope and Similitude, that is, ſpiritual eating; for as Corporal eating nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifheth the body unto life Natural, ſo doth Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al feeding upon Chriſt by faith, nouriſh and quicken the ſoul unto life eternall; and ſo though Chriſts words here are ſpirit, as he faith [my words are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit] that is, import a ſpiritual eating, yet the ſenſe of them is never the more ſpiritual, as if different from the Letter, for the Letter of this word [Spirit]
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51256:21"/>
gives the ſenſe of the Trope, denoting Spiritual eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet with the help of a little Logick too, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract put for the Concrete, Spirit for Spiritual; and in the Concretion, the adject Spiritual, connoting its ſubject Eating, is as much as Spiritual eating; and ſo the ſenſe being Tropical, is, in that reſpect, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, Literal; the ſenſe of Scripture, with this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, being of two kinds, Proper and Tropical, as aforeſaid, and both Literal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You will wonder, it may be, I ſhould ſay, There is no ſenſe of Scripture but only Literal; and thereupon Object,</hi> What Divines ſhould mean, by obſerving a diſtinction of the Letter from ſome other thing differing in the meaning of the words beſides it?</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, 'Tis true, as I ſaid at the firſt of this paſſage, many wiſe and good Chriſtians generally miſtaking theſe oppoſitions of Letter and Spirit; which I have but now opened, and are the only to that purpoſe, throughout the whole book of God, and all profeſſing a Literal ſenſe. That for want of a term contra-diſtinct unto Literal, have in that neceſſity allowed a ſenſe Spiritual; but, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied therewith, I conceive, upon further diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, have been found to underſtand themſelves only in a ſenſe of a Rhetoriſm or a Trope; which, not knowing what to oppoſe unto the Letter, under the ſaid miſtakes they have called Spiritual, though indeed it be in true underſtanding only Literal, according to the common manner of ſpeaking by Tropes and Figures, which bear their part in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the mind in all Languages, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51256:21"/>
with Grammar make up the whole buſineſs of Utterance, or the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the word diſcovering the ſenſe of the minde, bearing a ſignification either plain and proper, and ſo hath been taken for the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; or Tropical, and more myſterious, and ſo hath been taken for Spiritual; but in true judgement, the literal word is common to both, Proper and Tropical: the Trope and Rhetoriſm both in word and ſenſe, being in the letter of the Scripture alſo, as well as the Proper, though not ſo frequent as the Proper and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical; yet ſo, of a meaning literal as well as the other, and in that reſpect all ſenſes of words Typical, Parabolical, or otherwiſe Tropological (as I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive with ſubmiſſion to better judgements) can be thought no more then Literal, and the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of them to be underſtood, by endeavouring to find the extent of the Letter only.</p>
            <p>Away therefore with that deception of a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſenſe of Scripture, whereby the ſafety of Divine Truths, hath been, and may be ſtill, much in hazzard. And let us conceive of Gods meaning in his Word, ſpeaking to us, as we ſpeak to one another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the uſe of ſenſing the words in the practice of Nations, without which we can never be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to underſtand him; and if we cannot yet teach the myſtery of every letter, let us be content till God in the ſeaſons of his Grace and Wiſdom, ſhall afford us helps of a further diſcovery, by his bleſſing upon the labours of Pious and Learned men, whom God hath ſet forth hitherto, and doubtleſs will hereafter, during the being of his Church upon Earth, as lights in his Candleſtick for the further
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51256:22"/>
manifeſtation of the hidden Truths of his Word every day; and let us beware of our own Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical conceipts of Spiritual meanings through Revelation and Infuſion, which will vary the rule and ſtandard of Truth, and make Gods own Word no better than a Leaden Rule and a Noſe of Wax.</p>
            <p>A Seventh deceitful Principle, is, That of a mere Moral man in the Church of Chriſt, and allowed indeed by the profound miſtakes of wiſe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſtians of many ages and profeſſions, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of late, but of a dangerous and deſtructive uſe in the practice thereof by the weaker ſort of deceivable and factious people; who acting the Annimal part of Religion, more than the Rational; Paſſion, Zeal, and Humor, more than Reaſon; and miſtaking Phariſaical niceneſs, for Godlineſs; and for Purity, Singularity and preciſeneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Evill, avoidance only of Indifferences both Civil and Religious; and true pious heavenly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, for Phanſie and Affectation; they preſume themſelves in their erroneous and proud conceits, to be the only true <hi>ſraelites</hi> of God, the only holy and ſeparate from the reſt of men in the love of Gods Election, the only pecultar, regenerate, and ſpiritual above all others, though of the ſame Church in Faith, Baptiſm, and Worſhip, accompting the reſt only mere Moral men, of no more intereſt in Chriſt and his Graces, than the mere civil <hi>Pagans, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that denyed him as a point of fooliſhneſs: whereupon follows a proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all but thoſe of their own Society, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51256:22"/>
conſequently Separations, Schiſms, and Diviſions in the Church, and thereafter Seditions and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the State civil, even Rebellions againſt Kings and Princes; all Perſons whatſoever, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the Sect, being ſlighted and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued as mere Moral men; like empty Chaff or fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs trees, fit fuel for the fire of unruly furious Zeal; though in impartial and right underſtanding, the deſpiſed prove in plain terms, no other than the moſt wiſe, and regular, and righteous of a whole Church and Nation. This Divinity hath been a long time Oracular, both in Preſs and Pulpit, though ſo pernicious in the uſe of it, as an occaſion of ſo much evill, but yet moſt falſe and deceitful.</p>
            <p>For either the perſon ſuppoſed for a mere Moral man in the Church, profeſſeth Chriſt in Communion of Faith and Worſhip with the reſt of the Church, or not; if not, then he is no Chriſtian, and no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Church; for no Church allows any ſuch as profeſs not Chriſt, and ſo no ſubject of the queſtion, which was of a mere Moral man in the Church: If he doth profeſs Chriſt with belief and duty, he goes beyond a mere Moral man; for a mere Moral man that practiſeth nothing but civil Virtue, as the wiſe <hi>Grecians</hi> that diſputed St. <hi>Paul</hi> againſt Chriſt, he goes not ſo far as to acknowledge him, but denyeth him, and ſo is of no Church, he's no Chriſtian, no ſubject of the queſtion. The enquiry would rather be, Whether the man profeſſing Chriſt, doth it really, inwardly from his heart, or not? if not, he is in right ſpeaking, a mere Formalliſt, a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite in his proper and diſtinctive denomination;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51256:23"/>
not a mere Moral man properly, he's a Hypocrite, I ſay, whom God only can diſcover and pronounce abſolutely, not we, who ſee no further than by fruits and effects, which are Moral and Civil Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, duties only of the Second Table; thoſe of the Firſt Table being implyed by the ſuppoſition of the perſons profeſſion of Chriſt: whereupon the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will further be, Whether the ſuppoſed mere Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man profeſſing Chriſt doth practiſe theſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or not? if he doth practiſe them, either he doth practiſe them in ſuch a degree as becomes a perfect ſound Chriſtian, and ſo he is no Moral man, nor ſubject of the queſtion; or elſe, not ſo perfectly, but with often recidivations and backſlidings, failings and weakneſſes, but not quite relinquiſhing his Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo he is not yet a mere Moral man, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a weak Chriſtian, needing Church Diſcipline to reſtore and ſtrengthen him, and ſo yet, no ſubject of the queſtion. Or if he doth not practiſe the ſaid Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues or Duties of the Second Table at all, but lives altogether lewdly, wickedly, and incorrigibly; ſo he's not ſo good as a Moral man, nor therefore a mere one, but a ſcandal, a leaven of Wickedneſs to be purged out, and not to be ſuffered in the Church, and ſo ſtill no ſubject of the queſtion, but a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the Adjection. Whereupon I conclude, that there is no mere Moral man in Chriſtian Society, but a groſs fallacy tending only to deceive you of your Peace, Order, Unity, and Charity, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage diſtances and diſtinctions of ſome men, who conceit themſelves in their Spirituals more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than their Brethren, and thereupon proud oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51256:23"/>
and contentions in aſſertion of each Parties reſpective Excellencies above others, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent'y Factions and Diviſions, Tumults and Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and laſtly, Rebellion it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus we have reaſoned ſo many fallacious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſin, whereby it deceiveth the fooliſh and ignorant into their wicked miſtakes: Let us now come to one word of Application, and ſo to an end.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Deceit</hi> be ſo intrinſecal and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate one with the other, we ſhould all then ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider and examine, the great paſſages and chief moments of all the Actions of our lives, and by a true reflection and inquiry, if poſſible, make a diſcovery unto our ſelves, whether we have not in many things been very much deceived, and thereupon ſuſpect and jealous our ſelves, leſt we we have very much ſinned alſo, and conſequently to prepare for ſound Repentance.</p>
            <p>That the greateſt part of our <hi>Iſrael</hi> have been pityfully deceived, and erred in the wayes of their own Inventions, may eaſily appear by obſerving the ſad Paſſages of our late troubleſome Times; <hi>Men looked for Judgement, but behold Oppreſsion; for Righteouſneſs, but behold a Cry:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, ſaith <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> 'Tis the very proper and genuine quality of <hi>deceit,</hi> that men looking for one thing ſhould find another; <hi>They looked for Judgement, but behold Oppreſsion; for Righteouſneſs, but behold a Cry;</hi> They looked for a bleſſed Reformation, but behold an ugly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; they looked for a glorious King, but

            <p>And thus have we found <hi>Deceit</hi> enough, and in all likelyhood as much <hi>Sin.</hi> What remains then, but that every man gulity as aforeſaid, ſhould betake himſelf to Repentance, and in Repentance to confeſs, there being no one act in the work of Repentance, doth ſo much glorifie God as Confeſſion; in regard that the Creature in aſſuming ſhame to himſelf, transfers all the glory to his Creator: accordingly St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive;</hi> and this was the counſel of <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Achan, Confeſs my ſon, and give glory to God;</hi> and this was the practice of the Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries

had neither done nor ſpoke any thing amiſs, and fall to Expoſtulations and Complainings, and would fain inſimulate, as if very much wrong were done them, whileſt they detain other mens rights, (whom I ſpeak of with a reſerve, nevertheleſs, of Chriſtian reſpect unto thoſe of that Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in general, who we hope are better thew'd, for their own particular, as conſiderable worth hath manifeſted them by ſome contrary actions) which they defend and aſſert with much eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mordacity, though they are no other than the wages of unrighteouſneſs, given them by the late Rebellious Power, as a reward of their faithfulneſs to the <hi>Good Old Gauſe;</hi> for which they might as well have periſhed in the gainſaying of <hi>Corah,</hi> as thoſe that did. Beloved, This is not the way to obtain Peace with God or Men; I could wiſh rather that I might hear them, and all others of their Engagement, ſay, with <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David, Behold I have play'd the Fool and erred exceedingly, but bleſſed be then my Son David;</hi> Behold my good Brother or Brethren, we have play'd the Fools and erred exceedingly againſt our King, Church and Laws, whereas you by the grace of God, have been led in Peace and Loyal Righteouſneſs, bleſſed be you therein, and impact the comfort thereof unto us alſo, by favouring us with your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian compaſſion; or that I might hear them ſay, with <hi>David</hi> himſelf, <hi>I have gone aſtray like a ſheep, O ſeek thy ſervant, for I do not forget thy Commandements;</hi> then ſhould we receive them
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51256:25"/>
into the Armes of our Chriſtian and Brotherly embraces, and pray for them in the Language of our holy Letany, <hi>That it may pleaſe thee, O Lord, to bring into the way of Truth, all ſuch as have erred and are deceived.</hi>
