            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To the first, we positively say, that we are so far from opposing Magistracy, as that it would be to us matter of great rejoycing to know who were our Magistrates. But far greater to see such set up who are men fearing God, and hating covetousness, that so Justice might be duly executed without respect of persons, and Iudgment run down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream, that so there might be no more leading into captivity, and that complaining in our streets might have an end; But for our parts to take a ca<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nal weapon in our hands, or use the least violence either to support or pull down the worst, or to set up or maintain the best of men, we look not upon it to be our duty in the least; much less to have a thought of endeavouring to set up our selves, either directly or indirectly; for were we Abillitated and furnished with such endowments as might render us capable of being Rulers, yet could we not allow our selves to act as Magistrates, because we are a people <hi>chosen out of the World, Iohn</hi> 15.19. And look upon our selves as <hi>Pilgrims and strangers in the earth, Heb.</hi> 11.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1. But this we know to be the mind of God, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. the beginning, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2:13. <hi>Tit</hi> 3.2. that we are to be <hi>subject to, and not to resist the powers,</hi> because they be <hi>ordained of God</hi>; and as God sets them up, so he requires his Sons and daughters to render to them <hi>Tribute, Custome, Fear and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Rom.</hi> 13.7. And we further declare, That it is our bounden duty in obedience to our God, to <hi>pray for Kings, and all that are in authority,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2 So that we are so far from opposing them, as that we say it is our duty to obey them, in all civil things, that are agreeable to the mind of God, and if they shall require any thing from us that is contrary to his mind and will revealed in his holy Scriptures of truth, we say we are not to resist them, but if in conscience we cannot obey them, then we are patiently to suffer under them, whatever they shall inflict upon us for our non obedience to their requirements: and to this, we yet further declare, that it is, our real Judgment as to things spiritual, not to own them as our Law-givers in the least, <hi>for there is one Law-giver which is able to save and to destroy, Iam.</hi> 4.12. which is the Lord, <hi>Isa.</hi> 33.22. And therefore if they shall at any time impose upon us, Laws in point of worship, that is either to worship a false God, or the true God after a false manner, we by Gods assistance shall tell them with <hi>Shadrach, Meshach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego, Dan.</hi> 3.16. That we are not careful to answer them in that matter, yet shall not violently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, but with them patiently suffer under them as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>To the second, <hi>That we would destroy the publick Ministry of the Nation, that differ from us in some things about Religion</hi>; We do declare, that if there be a destruction intended between us, we must leave it at their doors, and desire them to Judge between the al-seeing God the searcher of all hearts and their own consciences, what they have intended by their so often pressing <hi>Parliament</hi> men from time to time, for a suppression of all that are not of their Judgment in matters of Religion: and upon search made, if they find themselves guilty of a desire of any such destruction to us, we shall beg them in Gods fear, to break off that evil by timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and make their pe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce with God; as for our parts, we are so far from desiring any revenge against them, or any other that shall desire or endeavour our ruin, as that in the presence of God, we shall rather pitty then envie them, and according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement of our Law-giver, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. <hi>pray for them,</hi> and their conversion, not at all in the least desiring or endeavouring their confusion: That there are many things wherein the publick Ministry of the nation and we differ, in matters of religion, both in doctrine and discipline, is very clear, and that we design or so much as desire the destruction of them, or any other persons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, for such differences, or any other matters concerning our selves, we hope in our further answer to this, and to the fourth and fifth particulars, we shall manifest to be as clear, and also therein discover our selves to be the <hi>peaceable Lambs of Christ, Iohn</hi> 21.15. <hi>the great Shepheard and Bishop of our souls,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. Who doth require us to <hi>learn of him, for he is lowly and meek,</hi> Mat. 11.29. yet notwithstanding, we do declare, when or wherever some of us shall conveniently meet with any of them, either in private or in publick, we shall resolve (God assisting us) to <hi>contend earnestly with them for the faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> according to that exhortation of the Spirit of God, by his Apostle, <hi>Iude</hi> 3. and against them and all oppositions and opposers wha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>soever, as good <hi>Souldiers of Iesus Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3. <hi>fight the good fight of faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. In which combate we are confident, we neither shall hazard life, nor draw blood, for through mercy we can say, with our Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4 <hi>that though we live in the flesh, yet we warr not after the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the third, <hi>That we countenance the people called</hi> Quakers <hi>in their Irregular practice</hi>; To this we answer, and God is our witness we lie not, that we are so far from countenancing the <hi>Quakers</hi> or our selves in any Irregular practice, as that if we our selves be found in any such actings, we shall not violently oppose, but patiently subject to such penalties as the breach of such Laws cals for; it would have been well, if the assertors had declared wherein this Irregular practice doth consist, that so we might have given a more particular answer, yet we hope by what hath and shall be declared, it will easily be judged, that we for our parts are not such people as the Baptists generally are reported, and some shew themselves to be.</p>
            <p>To the fourth, <hi>That we endeavour a tolleration of all miscarriages in things Ecclesiastical and Civil under pretence of Liberty of Conscience.</hi> If by indeavouring a tolleration of all miscarriages in things ecclesiastical, the assertors intend amongst our selves in our own assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: we shall answer them as in the presence of God, the searcher of all hearts: That we are so far from any such toleration, as that we at this very day go under a reproach by that people we formerly walked withal, because in the reality of our souls, and the integrity of our hearts, we cannot allow of some things, that we judge to be of that nature amongst them, we well knowing, that the Lord Christ requires a perfect observation of, and a universal obedience to all things whatsoever he commanded; <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. And that as well to what hath been laid down by his Apostles, given in by the incomes of that Spirit that was to lead them into all truth, and to shew them things to come, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.13. which are also the commands of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37. as to those that were laid down by himself, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.12.15. so that we positively say, that if we shall allow of any miscarriages either in Doctrine or Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline amongst our selves, to thwart the mind of Christ revealed in his Scriptures of truth, we can expect no better answer from him, then a proclamation of our worship to be a vain worship, as once he declared against the Jews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. And therefore if miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges rise amongst us, we are to bring such miscarriages to the touch-stone of Gods word, and so weigh them in the ballance of the Sanctuary, and finding them either too heavy or too light, that is, either adding or diminishing from or to the mind of Christ, we are then to repair to those wholsome laws left us in Scripture record, for the regulating of such miscarriages, according to the nature
<pb facs="tcp:39698:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of them, as they are private or publick, or more or less in their several agravations; and as they are committed by persons standing in such or such relations: we say the more of this, because most persons think, and many do not stick to say, that we live and act in things Ecclesiastical as Libertines, and without Church government, because we withdraw our selves from the publick assemblies; But did such persons rightly consider, what the discipline of the Ministry of the Nation is, in their Parochial assemblies, who profess themselves to be the true Spouse and Church of Christ, and compare It with the mind of Christ revealed in the Scriptures of truth, who gives Laws to his Church, which is that body of which he himself is the head, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.15.21.22. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18.<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.19. They would then find themselves to be the Libertines and not we; and therefore we shall earnestly desire all that are unacquainted with the true discipline of the Church of Christ, well to weigh and seriously to consider these statute Laws of Christ, in that case pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.12, 19, 20. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2 15. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 4, 9, 11. The which as we will answer the contrary at the great day of account, we dare not in the least wilfully violate or neglect. But if by miscarriages in things Ecclesiastical, they mean that we endeavour a Tolleration of all miscarriages amongst them in their assemblies, we shall in the presence of God clear ourselves and say, we have nothing at all to do with them, in such matters, for we say, they are without as to us; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12, 13. And so we look upon our selves to be as to them: And if any one shall seem to be troubled at this term Without, and object and say, that we are all the Creation of God, and what need these expressions of, <hi>stand at a distance, I am more holy than you</hi>; To such we shall answer in the Spirit of Love and Meekness, and God is our witness without AUSTENTATION, That it is true, all the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> are the Sons and Daughters of God by creation, but few by regeneration and adoption; for <hi>many are called but few are chosen, Mat.</hi> 20.16. for not the <hi>hearers of the Law, but the doers shall be justified,</hi> Rom. 2 13. And not every one that saith, <hi>Lord Lord, shall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, but he that doth the will of the Father, Mat.</hi> 7.21. We well know, that many will say these are hard sayings, and cannot well bear them; But to such we shall give a direction in our Post-script, where from one of us they may expect, and we hope also find good satisfation as to the tearm Without.</p>
            <p>That we own Liberty of Conscience we confess, but under that or any other pretence, to endeavour a toleration of any miscarriages either in things Ecclesiastical or Civil, we have given (we hope) full satisfaion, for seeing it is the will of our Master to have the Tares and the wheat grow together till the Harvest, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.30. And that our Heavenly Father doth exercise his long suffering to the

               <hi>Peter</hi> and another of the disciples, and that by an immediate commission from Christ, the work being finished for which it was intended, we find an immediate and peremptory command for the sheathing it again; and this reason rendred from the lip of truth it self, <hi>for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword,</hi> Mat. 26.52. <hi>for whosoever will save his life, shall lose it,</hi> Mat 16.25. and we find no tolleration in holy writ to the people of God for the drawing it again in the least, neither by precept or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

saying of our saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.13.</p>
            <p>And we further declare, that as we are to be a peaceable people upon the account of action, so we look upon it to be our duty, to keep our selves from oaths, Ingagments, and Covenants, either for or against this or that person Government, or Persons whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>For because of SWEARING the Land mourneth, Ier.</hi> 22.10. <hi>For the Lord hath a controversie with the Inhabitants of the Land.

            <p>And therefore do declare our resolution herein, that we shall not (God assisting us) enter into any ingagement whatsoever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any such account, yet shall this say again, that we shall not violently resist the imposers, of any such ingagements, but shall pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently suffer the penalty of our non-obedience as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>And we further declare as in the presence of God, who is the searcher of all hearts, that as it hath been some of our great trouble for a long time, to see some of those that are in the same faith and order with us, so acting; so it is now become even an overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burthen upon our souls, to see them generally runing such a precippitant course, by which actings of theirs, the mouths almost of all men are opened against them, and that truth they professe, most ignominiously branded and reproached. And therefore we further declare, that in the sight of God, Angels and men, that we bear our Testimony against them in their present actings, and cannot stand by them, nor have communion with them therein, nor with those that strengthen their hands in standing by them; and must tell them in the words of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.55. <hi>That they know not what Spirit they are of</hi>; for, <hi>the Son of man</hi> (their Mr.) <hi>came not to destroy mens lives but to save them</hi>; The Premises considered, we shall appeal to the judgements of all rational men, whether we are guilty of what we are charged withall or not, yet if they shall still go on notwithstanding, to use us reproachfully for the name of Christ, we shall be so far from endeavouring or desiring a revenge, as that in the words of Christ, we shall in our requests at the throne of grace, crie out and say, <hi>Father forgive them they know not what they do.</hi>

            <p>For thus saith the Lord by his Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.2. <hi>Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</hi> vers. 3. <hi>For your hands are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with blood, and your fingers with iniquity, your lips have spoken lies, your tongue have muttered perverseness.</hi> vers. 4. <hi>None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</hi> vers. 5. <hi>They hatch cockatrice egs, and weave the spiders web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is chrushed breaketh out into a viper.</hi> vers. 6. <hi>Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</hi> vers. 7. <hi>Their feet run to evil, and they make hast to shed innocent Blood, their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, wasting and destruction is in their paths.</hi> vers. 8. <hi>The way of peace they know not, and there is no Iudgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths, whosoever goeth therein, shall not know peace.</hi> vers. 9. <hi>Therefore is judgment far from us, we wait for light, but behold obscurlty: for brightness, but we walk in darkness.</hi> And so read on to the 18. vers. and vers. 18. <hi>According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies, to the Islands he will repay recompence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But lest any man should think us to be what we are not, by what hath been inserted in our paper, after our subscriptions, we shall in <hi>FINE</hi> declare, that in the presence of God we fight not against sinners but their sins, against sinful Actions and not persons, as they stand in such or such relations in this Land of our nativity; And therefore shall earnestly beg all of all ranks and qualities, to set themselves upon the work of self examination, and to take that good advice from the Lord by his Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Wash ye, make ye clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to do evil, and learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widdow; (TO WHICH) if ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the Land, but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be destroyed by the sword, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it,</hi> vers. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>And to our dissenting Brethren, we shall give that Christian advice, that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> once gave to the Corinthians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>That they cleanse themselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</hi>
