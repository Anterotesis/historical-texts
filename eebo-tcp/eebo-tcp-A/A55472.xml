            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My dearest Daughters,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce the time that Providence se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated your Mother and you from me and your Brother, tho al my melancholy Houres have seemed to run exceeding slowly, yet those especially have been unto me the most heavy and irksom, which we were formerly accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to imploy in your Brother's and your Instruction. My Pleasure was then great, to observ your daily Proficiency in divers commendable Qualifications, under your Mother's discreet Conduct; and it was consummated in those Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Conversations wherin we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised your discursive Facultys. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Interruption of that Pleasure has not a little augmented unto me the
<pb facs="tcp:42266:4"/>
Tediousness of her and your Absence.</p>
            <p>Now the best Remedy that I have been able to finde for this Trouble has been to exercise my own Thoughts in the same Meditations wherin we formerly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea yours. And after having don so som while, I resolved in my Minde to draw them up into such a Form as I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily made the Method of my Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. You remember, undoubtedly, how I have often told you, That our <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> is at least <hi>seemingly,</hi> if not really, a kinde of <hi>Remembrance:</hi> I mean, That there ar such Seeds of it in our Nature, as ar always ready to sprout out in the same manner, when they ar assisted by the same convenient Culture; such an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in our general Ideas of Things, as upon the same Hints and Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and with the same strictness of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, wil resolv into the same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conclusions. This, I say, has made me digest my Meditations into the Form of a <hi>Conference;</hi> In the first part of which (it being properly <hi>Catechisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:42266:4"/>
the <hi>Respondent</hi> is led by a natural Order of Questions to draw his Answers out of his own Stock.</p>
            <p>In the doing of it I have made use of your <hi>Brother's</hi> Name, and have thereby given him a peculiar Title to the thing. But as I am desirous that it may be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Memorial of me unto al of you, when I shal be no more, I therfore make it yours also by this Dedication: And for the same Reason, I have likewise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto it a Copy of that <hi>Advice</hi> which I formerly gave him, in such Verse as my unpractis'd Muse then dictated.</p>
            <p>The Subject I have treated is the most important of any Subject. And my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in handling it is to give al of you <hi>som real Help to conduct your selvs in the tru Way to Happiness:</hi> Which I take to be the onely warrantable End of any long continued Study. How far I have succeeded in that Design wil be best known by the Fruits you shal bring forth in your Liwes and Conversations. But now that those Fruits may spring
<pb facs="tcp:42266:5"/>
up the more easily, and without Danger of being choaked by the Weeds of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, I wil indeavor a little to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the one, and remove the other, by acquainting you with som particular Rules which I prescribed unto my self in this Undertaking, and by which you may take a right Measure of the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
            <p>I have often, with Grief, reflected upon the great Differences that ar in Men's Opinions about Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And in seeking out the Causes therof, tho I know many have concurred, yet this has seemed to me one of the most universal, <hi>viz.</hi> Because Men have not examined things to the Bottom. They have failed in their <hi>Foundation-Work.</hi> They have too much slighted that <hi>Philosophy, which is the Natural Religion of al Men; and which being Natural, must needs be Universal, and Eternal;</hi> and upon which therfore, or at least in Conformity unto which, al instituted and revealed Religion must be
<pb facs="tcp:42266:5"/>
supposed to be built. They have also forsaken the Rule of <hi>Right Reason,</hi> which onely is capable to produce tru Synemetry in their intellectual Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: And they have applyed themselves, without any Rule, to the Interpretation of <hi>Words and Phrases,</hi> which being ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily susceptible of various Senses, have produced as many deformed Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys. Nay this Disorder has been so great, that, instead of digging in the least for their Foundation, they have frequently begun to frame their theological Systems at the highest Points of Revelation: And in that they have acted as extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly, and uncertainly, as that Man should do, Who would undertake to frame a Roof for som Fabric, of whose Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions be had no Cognizance. Tore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this Evil, I have begun my <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism</hi> at the first Principles that I could discern in human Nature, and I have proceeded to build therupou as gradually and regularly as I have been able. So that I hope the whole Business of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb facs="tcp:42266:6"/>
whether natural or instituted, wil appear in this Draught to be a steady Prosecution of one and the same regular Design, in God the Author of both. And I am sure that a right Under standing of that Truth wil give great Satisfaction to any considering Minde.</p>
            <p>Another thing that has yet more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me than the former, has been to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv the sad Consequences in which Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde has been involved by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Differences of Opinion. Rash Judgments and Censures, Hatreds and Animositys, Disputes and Wars. The milde and sociable Nature of Man has been therby transformed into a greater Ferocity than that of Bears and Tygers. And what is the most deplorable Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of al, is, That these Mischiefs have been more frequent, and more violent, since the Propagation of <hi>Christianity</hi> in the World, than before: As if indeed <hi>Jesus-Christ,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Matt. 10.<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <pb facs="tcp:42266:6"/>
               <hi>Peace upon Earth, but Division and a Sword.</hi> Far be it from us, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, to attribute any such thing to the Genius of his Religion, which consists wholly in Humility, Meekness, Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Benignity, and other such like So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Vertues. No, the Mischief arises from the Perversness of Men's Spirits, who have turned the wholsomest Food, nay the highest Elixir, into the rankest Poyson. They have not been content with the <hi>Simplicity of the Gospel, which is a plain Rule of living wel,</hi> but have sirove to out-wit one another in finding out hidden Misterys: And as any one has hit upon a conceited Distinction, he has immediatly called that Fancy the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christianity. From thence have sprung the various Sects into which the Christian World is divided. And secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Interests being now interwoven with this vainglorious Humor, the distinction of Sects is kept on foot, and looked as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, far more carefully than the essential Dutys of Life. This is the deplorable
<pb facs="tcp:42266:7"/>
State of Things at this time. And the Consideration hereof has been the Needle that has chiefly directed my Course in the management of my Subject. For having seen the fruitless Effects of al controversial Undertakings; Fruitless, I say, in any thing that is truly Good; but exceedingly too fruitful in nourisb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Seeds of Enmity and al manner of Evil; I resolved with my self, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking this Work, to avoid studiously al that ever is controverted by any that cal themselvs Christians; and to draw up onely a Scheme of such things as they ar al agreed in, and which lead directly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Practice.</p>
            <p>These, I say, have been the particular Rules unto which I have thought fit to consine my self, in the Conduct of my main Design. And therfore I advise you to apply your selvs onely to the making use of what I have clearly exprest, and to be very referved in drawing Inferences from my Omissions. Becaus I prosess plainly to you that I have not handled
<pb facs="tcp:42266:7"/>
every point that I my self judg useful, but onely such as I judg most useful, and most conformable to the foregoing Rules.</p>
            <p>Now, to conclude, I must declare to you that I am strongly perswaded som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Nature might be of great Use in the World, towards the healing of our sad Divisions in religious Affairs; by drawing men off from their vain Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetys, to solid and useful Doctrin. Tho I know also that any such Design would, in its first Appearance, be violently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by al those who have imbraced the Interest of any particular Sect. If this very Writing of mine should com to the Sight of any such Persons, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that, tho they should finde nothing exprest in it but what they themselvs approve of, yet the Omission of other things which they delight in, would make them condemn it. Al Sectarya ar so fond of their own Badg of Distinction, that they ar ready to cry out against eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing which bears not that Mark, as Antichristran at least, if not Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb facs="tcp:42266:8"/>
and <hi>Diabolical.</hi> Nevertheless their Approbation, in such a Case as this, is of greater Weight than their Censure: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the one they al agree; but in the other they al differ. Neither <hi>Papist</hi> nor <hi>Protestant,</hi> nay nor any of the Subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions on either side, but approve of al Instructions tenaing to Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu; which ar the onely, things here aimed at. In that they ar unanimous. But in Matters of meer Speculation, and outward Oeconomy, (which ar the Things here omitted) they ar as opposite to each other as the Poles of the Heavens. I lay hold therefore upon the Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which arises from their general Approbation; and refer unto them the Task of reconciling their own Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, before I shal esteem the Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therof to be of any great moment. Yet I do not, for al this, in any wise pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to think that these Meditations of mine ar proper for public View. An undertaking of that Nature requires far greater Abilitys in every respect than
<pb facs="tcp:42266:8"/>
mine ar, and a more intire and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Leisure than I injoy. If God see it fitting, he wil in du time raise up som other that may perform it more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily. In the mean while, however, I hope the Endearment of a Fathers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation wil ad som Strength unto what may be otherwise but weakly incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his Children; and that so this present Performance wil be of som use unto wine, for whom especially I have writ it. <hi>I am,</hi>

               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I am infinitely obliged to you for your constant care of my improvement in al things laudable, and shal at this time endeavor to observ the Rules you giv me as exactly as possibly I can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Tel me then, in the first place, what it is that thou lovest best.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I know you wil not have me distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between your self &amp; my Mother, &amp; I hope you doubt not but you ar both of you the joint objects of my best Lov.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>No matter what I think, or what I doubt of. I desire only to hear thy Thoughts, but to hear them pure and undisguised. That thou may'st not therfore either deceiv thy self, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble with me, consider this case. Suppose both thy Parents and thy self had been any where lock't up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so long, without Food, that we
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42266:10"/>
were al wel nigh ready tody for Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that in those Circumstances som Friend sent thee privately a smal morcel of Meat, capable only to sustain thy Life for a few Hours, and withal sent word that we could none of us in that space have any more. In such a case, tel me truly whether thou wouldst eat that Meat thy self in private as it was given thee, or discover and giv it unto either of us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>You put me to a hard choice, which I would willingly be dispensed from.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I know very wel where the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty pinches thee. 'Tis not in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, but in declaring thy Choice. Wherfore I once again exhort thee to deal freely and sincerely with me, and I assure thee that I wil not be offended with any Determination thou shalt make, but on the contrary much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to hear one made in Simplicity and Truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>What you intimate of Offence as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures me that I need not make any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42266:11"/>
at al upon that matter. For I perceiv therby that you know the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my Nature, and fee into those secret movings of my Heart which I am ashamed to discover.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis enough. I wil spare thy Blushes. And now taking for granted that, in such a case as we have suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, thou wouldst prefer the Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy own Life before ours, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire thee to consider again, and tel me whether thou lovest thy self or us the better.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>What shal I say! You force me to acknowledg that I lov my self better than perhaps I ought to do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>That is not the thing that I am now enquiring after, whether this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Inclination of <hi>Self-love</hi> be wel or il, but onely whether it be so or no. Consider therfore, further, if there be nothing else in Nature that more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affects thee than thy self. I mean not Persons, but Things. Dost tho not feel in thy Heart som desire of <hi>H<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42266:11"/>
                  <hi>of Power, of Pleasure, or of Riches?</hi> I know thou dost. Tel me therfore in what rank thou placest those things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I do not finde that I lov any of those things simply for themselvs; but only as they have relation unto me and becaus they may be of som Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Advantage unto me: So that my lov of them is but secondary, and for my own sake. And therfore, for ought I now see, I must remain of Opinion that <hi>I lov my self primarily, and the best of any thing.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt thou dost so: Nor shal I ever advise thee to do otherwise. But here I must admonish thee that the management of this Principle requires thy utmost Care. For upon the right or wrong use therof depends thy Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness or Misery. Observ therfore that, tho this <hi>self-lov</hi> be a single and general Rule of Nature, yet those things which thou hast wel observed that we lov secondarily ar exceeding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42266:12"/>
various; and that nothing is more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy nor more ordinary than for Men to er therin, and out of a wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Opinion of som good, to place their Affections upon such things as ar really evil. Now the sad Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of such il-placed Affections is at the best a certain Frustration. For tho those Persons do obtain that very thing which their Desires ar let out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet finding not therin that real Good which they expected, their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment is the same or greater than if they had obtained nothing at al. And this alone is no smal degree of Misery; but instead of Good to finde an Evil, is a great one; and to be continually obnoxious to such like Miscarriages, is the greatest. These ar the Effects of Precipitancy, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Error. But, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to weigh deliberately the tru Valu of things, to understand it, and accordingly to direct our Affections unto the prosecution of such Objects
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42266:12"/>
as ar truly valuable, these ar the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods in which our <hi>Principle of self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov</hi> must be conducted, and in that manner it wil not fail to lead us to a happy Issu. These things I tel thee beforehand that thou mayst be sensible of their Importance, and therupon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thy Minde with du Circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the discussion of such Questions as I have now design to propound unto thee.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Alas, I am at once so sensible both of the Necessity and Difficulty of that Work, and therupon so fearful of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying in it, that I am forced rather to beg the benefit of your Instruction than to expose my self to such an Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Be not so diffident of thy self. Take Courage. Remember onely to observ my Advice of attending closely to the genuine Results of thy own Reason, and let us try whither that wil lead us.</p>
               <p>Seeing that in the general thou find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42266:13"/>
thy self inclined to <hi>lov or desire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but as it appears som way condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to thy <hi>own</hi> Good,</hi> consider a little which of those things that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to thee appear most so; and tel me therupon which of them thou most desirest. I wil repeat and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle explain them, that thou mayst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate maturely. By <hi>Honor</hi> I would have thee understand such a repute and fame of som thing excellent in thy self as may excite Admiration and Respect in others. By <hi>Power</hi> I mean not onely strength of Body, but such an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over som number of Men as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them subject to thy Commands. By <hi>Pleasure</hi> I intend not onely those childish Sports which thou hast hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to delighted in, and begin'st now to abandon, but al other manner of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights that may be suited unto the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Desires which thy Progress in Years wil bring along with it. And By <hi>Riches</hi> I would have thee repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto thy self the means whereby
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42266:13"/>
Men ordinarily procure unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs al outward Injoyments. Tel me therfore which of these things dost thou now conceiv most conducive to thy Happiness.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>As you represent them they al, seem good upon different accounts. And for ought that I know many other things besides these may be represented unto me in the same manner. So that truly I finde a great Difficulty to make any just Comparison between them, and therupon to determin which hath absolutely the most good in it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>What, art thou so unresolved in thy Judgment concerning the valu of these things that thou bearest an equal Indifferency towards them al, and hast no Inclination or Desire after any of them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>To proceed with that Precaution which your Lesson requires, it certainly behoovs me to govern my Desires by Judgment, and therfore to restrain al de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of those things until I be convinced of their different valu.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb facs="tcp:42266:14"/>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Wel, but for al this, I am of Opinion there is somthing else, which thou doft already so far understand to be for thy good that thou canst not chuse but desire it earnestly: And I had rather hear thee remark it thy self than that I should name it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Let me see. Thus far we ar com. There ar many things which present themselvs unto my Choice under the appearance of Good; som of which ar indeed such as they seem to be; others notwithstanding al their specious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ar real Evils; but how to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and distinguish between the one and the other I am yet ignorant. You ask me now what it is that I most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. Absolutely it is nothing else but <hi>such a Knowledg of al things relating to my own Good as may inable me to chuse and prosecute that which is really most conducive unto it.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I perceiv then that <hi>Knowledg is the primary Object of thy Desire.</hi> And I am not a little pleased that thou
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42266:14"/>
makest it so: Because indeed it ought to be the first Spring of al our Motions. But that is yet too general. Tel me therfore what particular Study of Knowledg thou art chiefly addicted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Is it the <hi>Knowledg of God,</hi> of his Essence, of his Attributes, of his Laws? Is it the <hi>Knowledg of Nature,</hi> of the Universe, of Mankind, of thy Self? Is it the <hi>Knowledg of any particular Arts</hi> and Contrivances that ar effected by Men? Or is it <hi>any other thing</hi> that humane Understanding is or may be conversant about?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I must answer again unto these Particulars as the former, that I am rather confounded with the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof than any ways able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min which of them is indeed most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be elected. But however this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Circumstance, which I stick close unto, viz. <hi>That my Knowledg may be such as to enable me to chuse and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su the proper means of my own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,</hi> wil I hope by degrees conduct
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42266:15"/>
me unto som further Discovery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Thou ghessest right. It wil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly do it. Let that therfore be the Rule of al thy Researches. And now, applying that Rule to those particular heads of Knowledg that I propounded, <hi>God, Nature, Man, &amp;c.</hi> tel me which of them seems to thee the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Object of thy first Study.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>My aim being to seek <hi>my own Happiness,</hi> I conceiv easily that it is not obtainable, first, without som com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent <hi>Knowledg of my self</hi> who am the Subject of it; next, without som <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of that Happiness</hi> which is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my Desire; and lastly, without the <hi>Knowledg of the Means</hi> that lead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. And therfore I conclude it may be proper enough for me to begin my Study with an Enquiry into <hi>my own Nature.</hi> That, I suppose, wil also shew me what sort of <hi>Happiness</hi> I am ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of: And I esteem that it wil then be seasonable to look after it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Very wel. I like thy Method.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42266:15"/>
It is orderly. And the prosecution of it wil probably bring into consideration whatever other Topic may be materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to our Subject. Now, that we may proceed therin, I would have thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect seriously upon what thou judgest most observable in thy self, and then tel me <hi>what manner of thing thou takest thy self to be.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I can not but observ that where ever I am I fil som place, even as al other material things that surround me: And therfore what ever I am, I think my self to be framed of the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as they ar.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>So far right. But dost thou not further perceiv som Facultys in thy self which ar peculiar to Mankinde, and which none of those other materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things that surround us ar endued with?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. I have <hi>Sense,</hi> which is not found in Stocks and Stones. And I have further this Faculty of <hi>thinking, reflecting, or reasoning,</hi> wherin you
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42266:16"/>
now exercise me, which I take to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note som Excellency in Mankinde vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from any thing even in Animals, and that not onely in Degree but Essence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>These two Observations of thine lmply this Definition of our selvs; <hi>That we ar thinking Substances.</hi> But it remains stil to be enquired, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that forementioned material part of us which thou hast observed to fil som place (or, as others express it, to be extended) I say, Whether that be not the very same thing with that which thinks, and that so this think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reasoning be nothing else but an effect produced by the different Modification and Motion of that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherof we ar composed; Or, on the contrary, Whether our thinking Faculty proceed from any other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and really distinct Principle. This Consideration is important. Weigh it carefully.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I hope I have not been too rash in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42266:16"/>
hinting already that I ghest that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to denote som Excellency in us essentially different from any thing in Animals, whose Composition. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be one of the perfectest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of modifyed Matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I do not say thou hast been too shra in that Assertion. But however, without determining any thing about Animals, the knowledge of whose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is of little Consequence to us, I desire to hear thee explain more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon what ground thou fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est any Principle in thy self to be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially different from Matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>If I finde any Operation whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in my self abov the Power of matter, I must needs conclude that it proceeds from som Principle of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nature.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Canst thou giv me any Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of such like Operations?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>When I reflect upon the nature of Matter, <hi>its extension, its divisibility, its aptitude to receiv never so various</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:42266:17"/>
                  <hi>Modifications and Motions,</hi> yet, into what ever Form or Motion I conceiv it put, I can not for my life finde any such thing to result from thence as that bare Sensation which I am endowed withal. Much less therfore is it to be reputed the Principle of my nobler Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultys.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>What ar those nobler Facultys which thou thinkest meer Matter least capable to produce?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>They are chiefly <hi>Memory and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Why dost thou affirm that <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not capable of Memory?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>If we were composed onely of meer Matter, then al the Remembrance that we have of any thing would be effected by material Impresses or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters placed in that part of our Body where that Faculty resides.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I grant it. And why may we not believ that it is so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>The multitude of things that we remember, would, upon that Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42266:17"/>
require such a multitude of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Characters, that it is impossible any such part of our Body wherin that Faculty can be placed should contain them; much less could it retain them in that Order, and represent them in that manner to our Imagination as we finde we have them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>It dos indeed seem absurd that so many various things as we have in our Minde should have there so many distinct material Existencys. And that wil appear yes the more absurd if we observ that amongst those Ideas which replenish our Minde, there ar som of them of things immaterial; as Truth and Falsehood, Vertu and Vice, Honor and Dishonor, and the like. But lot us go on. Explain to me now why <hi>Ratiocination can not be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by meer Matter.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>That needs no further explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than onely to settle the meaning of the word. By <hi>Ratiocination,</hi> therfore, I understand that Act of the Minde,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42266:18"/>
wherby, comparing together such No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as either have been long or ar but newly implanted therin, we from thence draw Consequences, and raise other Notions, which we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ignorant of. Now if <hi>Memory</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone be beyond the Power of Matter, it is past al doubt that this further Act, which revises, and compares such things as ar already in the Memory, must needs be much more so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>These Difficultys of explaining divers Operations that we finde in our selvs, by the Power of Matter, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to be invincible. But therfore, since we ar stil sure that we ar capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of those Operations, it remains that thou explain unto me by what other means they ar performed, and <hi>shew me that different Principle from which they proceed.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Alas, you now pose me. I am not able to do it. Those very things, <hi>Thinking and Reasoning,</hi> ar themselvs the most essential Characters that I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42266:18"/>
know of that Being which exercises them. I am onely sure that I have them in my self, but how they ar perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med I am utterly ignorant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>If it be so indeed that thou canst go no further, yet consider now at least what all this disquisition we have hitherto made into Humane. Nature amounts unto, and what consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces arise from thence for thy use.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>My knowledg hitherto amounts to this, That we have in us <hi>two distinct Principles;</hi> the one wherof is <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> whose eminent property is Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; the other <hi>immaterial,</hi> whose eminent property is Thought.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Those two principles ar termed <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> or in ordinary speech, <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> Let us make use ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of those received expressions. And now do thou go on to tel me what consequences thou perceivest to arise from this distinction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>The most important consequence therof is this, That our <hi>Bodys</hi> and <hi>Souls,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42266:19"/>
being of <hi>different natures,</hi> ar disposed for <hi>different injoyments and sufferings.</hi> The Body is not capable of those pleasures which ar peculiar to the Soul. Nor is the Soul, by any evident necessity, to be esteemed subject unto that change and dissolution which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Body.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>The necessity of the Souls disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with the Body is indeed not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from any thing thou hast observed upon their natures. But neither is this distinction of their natures so ful a proof, as might be wisht for, of so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable an expectation as that of the Souls duration hereafter. As we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further we shal infallibly meet with other arguments that wil yet better confirm those hopes. And other consequences also, of less importance, wil fal occasionally in our way, as we com to treat of other matters with which they ar connected. In the mean while, it is time now that we look back unto the method which thou
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42266:19"/>
first proposed'st for thy inquirys, and strive to discover <hi>what sort of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> that is which this nature of ours, such as we have described it, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I conceiv the ground and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of al bodily Happiness to consist in Health.</hi> The gratification of our several Appetites may indeed increase the degrees of it, but Health is the most essential ingredient, without which our Bodys wil be always mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And as for the <hi>Happiness of the Soul,</hi> I think it may be esteemed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat whensoever we injoy <hi>intire Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and contentment of minde.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Since thou distinguishest our Happiness into these two kindes, it is necessary to fix the just estimate of each of them; that we may theruption direct our chief pursuit after what shal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear most important.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I have no difficulty to determin the Happiness of the Minde, such as I have described it, to exceed that of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42266:20"/>
the Body: not onely becaus the Soul is the nobler Being, ('tis that which rules the body) but more especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus my Idea of that Happiness is the more compleat. For <hi>where the Minde is intirely satisfied there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting.</hi> Nevertheless, I would not despise the other. For I confess the business seems to me yet surer when both ar joyned. But that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration afflicts me: Becaus I observ daily, that, notwithstanding al imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable precautions, the Bodys of al men ar frequently afflicted with painful diseases, constantly obnoxious to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental hurts, and inevitably subject to final decay; which things make that sort of Happiness imperfect, or the attainment of it impossible. I look therfore chiefly towards the other: but, alas, I look yet in vain. My Soul seems capable of it: but it knows not where to finde it. I beg of you therfore to direct me speedily unto that object of my search: for I now des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42266:20"/>
al other study in comparison of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>This is what I have already hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thee, That the regular pursuit of thy Happiness would lead thee into the consideration of other topics than those thou hast hitherto mentioned. Consider, therfore, the nature of al things in this visible World. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Improvements that ar made upon nature, for our conveniency, by the art and contrivance of ingenious men. Ar any of these things, or al of them together, capable to confer that sort of <hi>Happiness</hi> which thou judgest to be <hi>peculiar unto thy Soul?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>No, they ar not. For, being al of them corporeal substances, they can have no operation but upon my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: or, at least, they cannot affect my Soul but by the means of those bodily Organs unto which it is now united. Since therfore we have already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Perfection of Bodily Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be unattainable, it is in vain for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42266:21"/>
me to expect that of my Soul by those means.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Where then wilst thou look for it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I know not wel. But since it is not to be found in any corporeal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence, nor is my Soul singly able to work her own happiness out of her self, I must either finde it in <hi>som thing more perfect than my Soul,</hi> or despair of ever finding it at al.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>What Idea hast thou of any thing more perfect than thy Soul?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I have yet no clear Idea of any such thing. But this I am sure of, that <hi>What soever made my Soul is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter than it.</hi> The Principle, what ever it be, from which it sprung, must contain in it self more eminent perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than those that I perceiv to be in me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Thou seest how Mankinde is born into this World, one Generation succeeding another; and that we ar born at once of such a double nature
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42266:21"/>
as thou hast observed, both Body and Soul. Dost thou therfore intend that answer as a mark of respect unto me, <hi>thy Father,</hi> as the Author or caus of thy subsistance?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I am deeply sensible of the respect I ow you. But I confess that I now look further. <hi>'Tis not onely the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of my own Being, but that of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, which I seek for.</hi> The propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof from Father to Son wil not serv my turn. For tho I revolv in my thoughts never so many thousand Ages backwards; nay tho I should go so far as to finde one single Man, the first of al men, from whom the Species has been derived; yet I have stil the same question to ask concerning him as concerning me. He made not himself. Who, or what, was it therfore that gave him his Being, and his capacity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get others like himself? Whatever that was, it must necessarily contain in it great Perfections. And it can be no indifferent thing for us to know,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42266:22"/>
or to be ignorant of it. For, as in the course of Generations there is a strict relation between Father and Son, the latter depending upon the former, and being naturally obliged to certain dutys towards him; so, much more ought we to conclude, that <hi>the general Author of Mankinde dos neither abandon his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, nor leav it free from Tys of Duty.</hi> And if I could once be so happy as to discover <hi>Him,</hi> and pay those dutys which I ow him, I doubt not but I should therin finde that further Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of happiness which I search after.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I perceiv this thought has warmed thee. But let us not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoot our mark. Thou inquirest after the <hi>original Caus</hi> of the first Man. Is that so difficult to conceiv? Consider the various Productions of nature. <hi>This Earth</hi> wheron we liv, our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Mother, being invigorated with the lively heat of our universal Parent, <hi>the Sun,</hi> produces yearly innumerable
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42266:22"/>
objects of equal astonishment with this thou stick'st at. Neither ar her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions confined to so exact a regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that we may not imagin her capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have som times brought forth other manner of Beings than what she now ordinarily dos. The od irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritys that we yet meet withal ever and anon ar an undeniable proof of it. And why may not therfore <hi>the first Production of Mankinde</hi> be attributed to the happy rancounter of som con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Matter, which, cherished and actuated by a du proportion of nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Heat, sprung up into that form we see it? If this do not satisfy, we shal be to seek for the <hi>first Caus</hi> of al other Animals as wel as of our selvs, and so involved in endless disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, I now perceiv that our disquisitions upon this head wil not be endless. We draw near to a resolution of them. Tho I should grant the possibility of man's producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42266:23"/>
in that manner which you have endeavored so plausibly to describe, that dos not at al extricate me from my first difficulty; but rather intangles me more in it, and obliges me to look further. Let it be so, that both Men and Beasts have been originally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Earth and Sun. Yet, <hi>Who is it that made that Earth and Sun,</hi> and also those other innumerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of gloroius bodys that environ us at greater distance? They have al had their <hi>First Caus</hi> as wel as we. And the close relation they have unto one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with their dependance upon one another, dos evidently demonstrate that the first caus of them al is one and the same. <hi>There is one, onely, original and universal Caus of al things.</hi> And that being so, I must rais my Idea of its perfections yet so much higher than I first conceived them, as the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal frame of al things is a complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter production than that of me in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. This consideration makes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42266:23"/>
me conclude those <hi>Perfections</hi> to be no less than <hi>infinite.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Thou hast rightly concluded. <hi>That Being which formed al other Beings must of necessity be absolutely perfect.</hi> And that is it which we cal <hi>GOD.</hi> The evidence of this conclusion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon such undeniable Principles that it cannot be doubted of. In the order of things that produce one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther som one must necessarily be first. Whatsoever that First be, it must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain supereminently in it self al those Perfections that ar scattered amongst the rest. And <hi>the uniting of those scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Perfections makes the Idea of their Author absolutely compleat.</hi> I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated these heads that they may be firmly rooted in thy Memory, and that so the Foundation of this important conclusion may never be shaken. But we must not rest here. <hi>This Idea of God is a Fountain of light.</hi> Let us follow the streams that it sends forth, and see whither they wil carry us. Tel me
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42266:24"/>
therfore more particularly what thou conceivest to be comprehended in this notion of <hi>A Being absolutely perfect.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>So great a perfection as that is surpasses my weak capacity. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I cannot imagin it possible for any Man, <hi>being finite,</hi> to comprehend the extent of those Perfections which we have concluded to be <hi>infinite.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Tho we cannot comprehend al, yet we may som. Attend therfore closely to the sense of that definition, and thou wilst not finde it difficult to descend into som Particulars.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Thus far indeed I think I see clearly; That <hi>a Being absolutely perfect neust have in himself whatever is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not onely to his own Being and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness but likewise to the Being and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Creatures.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>That is one step. Minde now the consequences of that answer, and thou wilst advance further. But do it by degrees. In the first place, examin what thou findest to result from the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42266:24"/>
first part of thy answer, which relates simply to the Being and Happiness of God himself.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>If he have in himself whatsoever is necessary to his Own Being, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he can in no wise be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med perfect) and if he have not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any thing from without himself, (which has been already demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in shewing that he is the First Caus of all things) it then follows that <hi>his Being or Existence is necessary;</hi> that it always has been, and that it always wil be; which is to say that <hi>it is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> Again: If He have in himself whatsoever is necessary to his own Happiness, (without which also he must fal far short of perfection) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not onely that his nature is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of a final dissolution, but even of any suffering or change; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Affectations incident to al <hi>Matter,</hi> I make use of the term you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me to signify its contrary, and cal him <hi>Spirit.</hi> Then, joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42266:25"/>
these two conclusions, I say that <hi>He is an Eternal Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>What ar the consequences of the second branch of thy answer, viz. That <hi>He has in himself whatsoever is necessary to the Being and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of his Creatures?</hi> Orra ther, first, what is the Reason upon which thou groundest that proposition? For it appears not so evident as the other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>The first part of that proposition is evident enough from the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of the Creatures. For since they ar, and ar from him, it is clear that he has in himself whatsoever was or is necessary either to produce or to conserv them. And to prove the second, I need onely observ wherin <hi>the general Happiness of the Creatures consists;</hi> which I conceiv to be <hi>in their attainment of that End for which their Author designed them.</hi> For it cannot be doubted but He, who had in himself the power to producethem, can much more easily by the same power conduct
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42266:25"/>
them to that end for which he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them. So that <hi>I finde in him the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal spring both of the Being and Happiness of althings.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Proceed then to draw the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of that proposition, as it relates to the Creatures.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>His giving Being and Happiness unto the Creatures seems to me to imply principally his Soveraign Perfection <hi>of Goodness, of Wisdom, and of Power. His Goodness</hi> is apparent in the design of al his works, <hi>his Wisdom</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of them, and <hi>his Power</hi> in the execution. The one prompts, the other directs; and the third accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishes. These I think ar the main Branches into which that consideration may be divided: and as we can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv the connexity of others with these, we may safely refer them to the same original stock of <hi>absolute perfection;</hi> which is <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Wilst thou go on to particularize
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42266:26"/>
any others that thou findest to have their Rise from these?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>That pursuit would be long. And I know not whether at this time it be very needful. For other Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wil of themselves occur in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occasions. And in the mean while I perceiv that we have in these three a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Foundation of that Happiness which I am seeking after. For seeing my notion of God's <hi>Wisdom</hi> assures me that he <hi>knows</hi> what is best, and his <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> that he is both <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>able</hi> to do it, I cannot doubt but it is <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready don.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>What, dost thou mean that by this discovery thou art now actually stated in that Happiness which thou wast a while ago inquiring after? For that is best for thee. And thou seemest to infer that whatsoever is best is already don.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>No. Tho I am assured that <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is best for the Universe is don,</hi> yet my comprehension of that general good is too short to determin me in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42266:26"/>
particular application of it. On the contrary, rather, since I finde my self to be yet short of that Happiness which my nature is capacitated for, I conclude that it is in order to som more general good that I am so. And, in effect, tho I cannot comprehend the depth of al God's workings, yet I easily see a possibility that it may be for the advantage of the whole that som sort of Creatures pass unto their Perfection by degrees. And probably I my self may be of that sort. This state wherin I now am may be a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. Which being so, it is sufficient for me in particular that <hi>I am put into the Way,</hi> and have a Capacity given me to work out in time that further Degree of Happiness which I yet want. And that I am really in such a Condition is clearly deducible from the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned triple Idea of God's Perfections. For, since I am capacited for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Degree of Happiness than what I now injoy, and since I am naturally
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42266:27"/>
bent upon the pursuit of that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it is unconceivable that infinite Goodness, Wisdom, and Power, should have given me that Capacity and that bent of Nature to be always frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I say therfore that my attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it in the end, provided I swerv not from the way, is as certain as if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready effected.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Since thou wilft not now pursu this search into the particular Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Deity any further, consider with thy self once again how far we ar yet com; and see, according to thy own proposed method, which way thou ought'st next to bend thy thoughts.</p>

               <p>I can do it easily. For I take care not to let slip that Clew which you directed me in the begining to hold fast. I seek my own Happiness. In order to that, I have considered what I am; what is the chief Happiness that I am capable of; and where that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness is to be found. I have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the noblest part of my Nature
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42266:27"/>
is Spiritual; that my chief Happiness must therfore also be Spiritual; and that it can onely be found in God. I have proceeded to take som view of those Perfections which the Idea of God presents unto me. And there we stick. Methinks therfore it lys now na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally before me to look after <hi>the Way or means that lead unto this Happiness</hi> which I have proposed for the ultimate object of my search.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis wel observed. Continu therfore to reflect attentively upon what thou hast hitherto discovered; and try stil, in thy own thoughts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the consideration therof wil direct thee unto those means or no.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I have indeed perceived som glimmering therof al along as we have proceeded, but now methinks I begin to discover a clearer light. You were pleased to turn me aside as I was once hinting at the consideration of our ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under som tys of Duty towards the Author of our Being: and I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42266:28"/>
that you did it with reason. For, as I had not then cleared up to my own minde the Idea of that Author, it would have been impossible for me, in those circumstances, to have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any right apprehension of my duty towards him. But now that I have attained to som competent knowledg both <hi>of him and my self,</hi> I doubt not but <hi>from the comparison of those Ideas I shall finde som Rule of duty to result.</hi> And I doubt yet less that <hi>my following that Rule is the direct and only means of bringing me to my desired Happiness.</hi>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Thou sayst thou doubtest not of these things. But, once again, why so fast? Why may it not yet be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether He have given us any such Rule or no? What importance is it to him what course we take? We see that al Men, who follow never so various ways of living, arrive indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and without distinction, at their last end, which is the Grave. And what Happiness then canst thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42266:28"/>
unto thy self to finde in one course rather than another?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I perceiv that I have been too hasty, in starting a double conclusion without explaining the premises from whence I draw it. My minde has run quicker than my tongue, and has cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my expressions to take that leap which your questions now bring me back again to walk over more leisure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I must do it therefore Step by Step, and endeavor to tread sure as I go along.</p>

               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I must prove then, in the first place, that the Author of our Being, which is <hi>God, has really obliged us unto som Duty;</hi> in the next place I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>what that Duty is;</hi> and in the last place, examin <hi>how my Happiness ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from it.</hi> My first Proposition is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. And methinks this general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration may serv to clear it. If God be the Author of al things, then <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we finde our selvs obliged unto by</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:42266:29"/>
                  <hi>the Nature of things;</hi> I mean either of God, of our Selvs, or of Others; <hi>we ar obliged unto it by God himself,</hi> who framed and disposed things in that manner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, if we ar under any such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, I wil not deny but that obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is laid upon us by God. But how dos it appear that we ar under any such obligation at al?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>If I mistake not, we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy sufficiently establisht that, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of our inquirys. The desire that every man has to procure his own Happiness is general, and whatsoever is general is natural. The ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in which men seek it ar different, and therefore som of them must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be preternatural. But the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bent after, and desire of Happiness, is the same in al men, and therefore <hi>the pursuit of it is an Obligation laid upon us by Nature her self; that is to say, a Duty injoined us by God.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Grant that the search of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42266:29"/>
in general be a natural inclination and by consequence our duty; yet, since al men ar subject to er in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ways of pursuing it; what can it avail us to know in general that we ar under such an obligation, while we have no rule to direct us in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar observance of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>You are pleased in that Question to make a Supposition which I must not grant. The Errors of som Men do not prove that we have no Rule gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to walk by; but onely that, if there be any such Rule, those Men do not observ it. And I think we have already agreed upon a Principle from which it wil necessarily follow that we have som such Rule given unto us, whether they observ it or no. If it be inconsistant with our Idea of God that he should have given us this bent of Nature after Happiness, and at the same time have subjected us to a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Frustration (which I prove to be inconsistant, in that such a Frustration
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42266:30"/>
is real Misery, and that it is directly repugnant to his Goodness to have framed Creatures on design to make them miserable) I say then, it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary that he should have given us som Rule whereby to direct us in the particular Pursuit of that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, which he has obliged us to seek after: because otherwise we should be for ever frustrated of it. Which is absurd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Canst thou show me <hi>a Rule</hi> which is <hi>capable to guide us exactly in this Pursuit,</hi> and which is <hi>general to al Mankinde?</hi> For such it must be, or none.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I think I can. And if I had not ghest at it beforehand, this last Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which you require in it is too evident a Distinction to leav any Doubt therupon. In a Word. <hi>The Rule of al our Actions is, or ought to be, Right Reason.</hi> This Faculty of Reasoning judges of Truth and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, of Good and Evil; weighs one
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42266:30"/>
thing with another, and chuses the best. The Progress you have already helped me to make therin assures me of a greater Perfection hereafter than what I have yet attained unto. I now indeed grope after an unknown way, and advance not without som Doubts and Fears; But I am perswaded that a continued sincere, and strict Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to this Exercise wil produce a steady firmness of Judgment, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to direct my Practice. And, abov al, I say that your last forementioned Character takes away al Doubt upon this matter. For if God have given any such Rule unto Mankinde (as it hath been already proved that he must of necessity have given som) it can be no other than this Rule of <hi>Reason:</hi> Becaus none other, than this, is or can be <hi>General:</hi> And this being so, must therfore be esteemed <hi>Natural;</hi> that is to say <hi>from God;</hi> and by consequence also <hi>Sufficient.</hi>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I'wil not just dispute against these general Arguments, which thou hast made use of to prove that God has obligedus unto som sort of Duty, and given us the means of knowing it. But however, I shal esteem the thing yet better proved, as wel as illustrated, when I shal see thee go through thy next proposed Enquiry with any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy, and shew me those particular Dutys that we ar obliged unto.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>To do that, I must refer our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys unto certain principal Heads, which are very obvious, and from which al particular Branches take their Rise. They ar these. <hi>To God, to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and to our Selvs. </hi> And I chuse to begin with the last of them. Let us reflect therefore upon our own Nature, which we have concluded to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of two Principles, Matter and Spirit, or Body and Soul. These two Principles in us contest frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themselvs, drawing several ways. The Body delights onely in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42266:31"/>
present gratification of its Senses, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing any Bounds therof, or foreseeing any Consequences. The Soul has not onely its own Delights of a more refined nature, but it also judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es concerning those of the Body. It weighs a sensual Gratification with a spiritual Inconvenience, a present Good with a future Evil; and it is able upon the Comparison of al Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances to chuse what is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the Happiness of the whole Man. Now from this simple Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our own Nature, I affirm that there results this plain Duty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon us, <hi>viz. That we ought to keep our Bodys in continual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto our Souls, as Servants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Masters.</hi> And the reason of that Duty wil appear yet more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Mischiefs that follow a contrary Practice. For where this Subordination is not established, al corporeal Gratifications grow exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive: And the Excess of such Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42266:32"/>
breeds enless Inconveniencys. Those of eating and drinking cloud and darken the Understanding, by the gross. Vapors which they send up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Brain. Others enervate the Strength of the Body. The very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of any of them with earnestness excites Passions, breeds Disorder in the Minde, and unfits it for Deliberation. And the too frequent Indulgment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of possesses the whole Soul, and stifles al Thoughts of any nobler Injoyment. In a Word therefore, <hi>it is our indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable Duty to use great Moderation in al bodily Satisfactions, and to preserv the absolute Dominion of the Soul over the Body unviolated.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <p>This is very wel. But it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else than what thou sayd'st e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now; That we ought to govern al our Actions by Reason.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I am very glad it is so. And I hope what I shal have occasion to say further in the remainder of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searches wil continu to prove so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42266:32"/>
I mean that <hi>Right Reason and Tru Interest wil be always found to be but one and the same thing.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>My next Task is to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those particular <hi>Dutys which we ar obliged unto towards our Neighbors.</hi> And that I may discern them clearly, I judg it convenient to take a View of my own Circumstances, and of the Relations wherein I stand towards others. I consider my self as born na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into the World, uncapable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide or help my self even with the Necessarys, much less with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencys, of Life; and therefore stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in absolute need of others Assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. From that Estate, by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of others, I grow up gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unto som measure of Strength, and become capable of many things. But with al that Capacity I am yet far short of being able to provide alone
<pb facs="tcp:42266:33"/>
for my own Subsistance. For, in effect, that Provision implys no less than to cultivate the Earth, and prepare the Fruits of it for Food and Rayment; to kil the Beasts, and prepare likewise their Flesh for Meat, and their Skins and Fleeces for cloathing; to dig up Stones out of the Entrails of the Earth, to hew down Trees, and build Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for Defence against the Injurys of Weather; The least of which things requires so many Instruments wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal they ar to be don, so much Art and Labor in the doing, that few Men ar capable of executing any one of them without taking Advantage and making use of som thing don by others; much less can any Man be ever capable of al. Nevertheless al these things ar so absolutely necessary for us, that it is not possible without them to preserv Life; or tho it could be preserved, yet even Life it self in that Condition would not be desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This being so, I have continual
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42266:33"/>
need of my Neighbor's assistance in one thing or another: and my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor has the same need of mine. To obtain his I must therefore giv him mine; and to obtain mine he must giv me his. It is not to be had on either side at any other price. Thus <hi>the Necessity of mutual Succor tys al MÃ¡n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde together in one common bond.</hi> It makes it as necessary for each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Person to endeavor the good of the whole as of himself in particular: because he cannot injoy the one but in contributing towards the other. There is the obligation of intrest which inforces the duty. And our duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting from hence is plainly this; <hi>That we bear an universal Lov and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will towards al Men.</hi> Or more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, That <hi>we look upon our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor's concernment as our own,</hi> and that so we be as ready to serv him in any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion as we desire he should be to serv us; Nay, that <hi>we look upon the general Conternment of Mankinde as far more</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:42266:34"/>
                  <hi>important than our own,</hi> and that so we preser the public Good, and the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment therof upon Principles of universal rectitude, before any sinister private Advantage. This I take to be a summary of that Law which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or God, obliges us unto towards our Neighbors. And whoever carrys this in his minde wil need no great comment to teach him his Duty in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occasions. This hearty Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence prohibits the doing any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Injury, and injoyns the doing al manner of Good. It lays also the foundation of Government, and it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to Truth and Justice, and to al other vertues which ar necessary to the preservation of Societys. In fine, it secures the Happiness of each man in this World, as much as that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness can possibly be secured. And therfore I conclude again, that <hi>this Friendly Disposition towards al men is a reciprocal Dury, nay the Fountain of al</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:42266:34"/>
                  <hi>such Duty, required of each man by God himself.</hi>

               <p>My next and last head is to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min what ar those particular <hi>Dutys which we ow unto God himself.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present therfore unto my self that Idea of absolute Perfection which we have attributed to the Author of our being. And the very first fight of so daz'ling an Excellency strikes me down before him in humble Adoration. The fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contemplation of it shews me my duty of submitting patiently unto al the dispensations of his Providence; as being assured that whatever is orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by such an <hi>Almighty</hi> Principle of infinit <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> cannot chuse but be for the best. I see ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ground of my praising him for what I have, and praying to him for what I want: because he is the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buter of al things. I am enamoured
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42266:35"/>
with the beauty of his Perfections, and therby drawn into an ardent desire of injoying those of them which ar communicable, and of imitating those of them which ar imitable, according to the degree of my capacity. That reflection fixes my thoughts praticular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness:</hi> the first of which remindes me to <hi>guide al my Actions by that measure of Wisdom,</hi> that principle of Reason, which he has given me: the other is a new <hi>incitement to al Acts of Kindness towards those that ar within my reach, and to an unlimited Benevolence towards al men.</hi> Al these things, and al the rest that I have deduced from former Heads, ar inforced upon me by the Authority of this supreme Law-giver. And this is <hi>the Perfection of al my Dutys, that I perform them in Obedience to his command, and with so exact a Sincerity, as may giv me confidence before him who beholds the inmost Secrets of my Heart.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Methinks thou hast omitted, upon this last head, to shew how those particular dutys towards God com to have the force of a Law upon us. At least thou hast not don it, as in the former heads, by shewing their connexity with our Intrest.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>If I have not don it so expresly as I should have don, yet I think I have tacitly implyed it. Besides that al those Dutys I have hinted at, ar evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent means of rendring me acceptable unto my Maker, and consequently of obtaining the fruits of his favor, which must needs include a high degree of Happiness; I say, besides that, the last ingredient which I required in al our Dutys (I mean that of Sincerity) dos carry along with it its own Reward, viz, that Satisfaction of Minde which is not otherwise to be had, and which we have som while ago concluded to be the highest degree of Happiness that we can here attain unto. So that this Set of dutys, as wel as the rest, have the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:42266:36"/>
                  <hi>of Interest to makethem a Law.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Well; since thou hast now gon thro' thy proposed Classes of duty, I wil at this time take a little review of what thou hast said; that we may see whether any difficulty yet remain, and what further is to be inquired after. Upon our Moderation in corporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and the apt disposition of our bodily Organs, follows a clearness of Minde capable to direct us in the choice and prosecution of our greatest Good. Upon our Kindness towards others follows their kindness towards us, and the effects of that Mutual Kindness ar private conveniency, and public security. Upon our humble and sincere Adoration of an al-seeing God follows that inward Comfort and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of minde which surpasses al other Worldly Felicity. And upon the contrary of al these practices follow the contrary inconveniencys. So that <hi>our Obligation unto these natural Dutys is confirmed by the natural Effects of their</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:42266:36"/>
                  <hi>Observance or Neglect; that is to say, by Rewards and Punishments.</hi> This is the substance of thy discourse upon those heads. Let us now examin if it be clear and uncontestable. I ask thee therfore; Do these Consequences so necessarily follow their Premises, these Effects their Causes, that whoever pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises those Dutys cannot fail to obtain that Happiness, and who neglects them to fal into those Inconveniencys that we have discoursed of?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I must acknowledg that those two first sorts of Happiness, which I have described as appertaining to the two first Classes of Duty, do not indeed so necessarily follow those Dutys but that they may somtimes fail. The Soul has not so absolute a Superiority over the Body as not to be somtimes disturbed thereby in her Functions, And the kindest natured Persons ar somtimes exposed both to Want and Injury. Nevertheless those Dutys ar the plain and ordinary means to avoyd
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42266:37"/>
these Inconveniencys. The first of them goes as far as the Frailty of our bodys can admit; &amp; the second would be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible if it were universally received. The Rule therfore must not be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected because of som few Exceptions; especially when those exceptions arise (as here) from extraneous causes. But however that be, the condition of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, which I mentioned under the last Classis of Duty, and required as a necessary circumstance in al the rest, dos necessarily and infallibly produce the Happiness which I ascribed to it. <hi>An Upright Conscience establishes the Minde in an unsbaken Peace, and fils it with joys unspeakable.</hi> That therfore supplys the deficiency of the rest, and is an inforcement sufficient to make the Law, which injoyns al the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Dutys, indispensable. For tho it do not giv an absolute, compleat Happiness, Happiness without al allay, yet it gives the best that our Natures in this World ar capable of.</p>

               <p>This would indeed be wel, if it were really found to be so in practice as thou imaginest it in Idea. But I doubt it is otherwise. Nay I must tel thee plainly, that in the course of this World, the Despisers of those Rules do oft times seem to injoy that very Felicity which the Observers of them seek in vain. <hi>Those that indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in bodily Excesses,</hi> have neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less their spiritual Facultys both quick and strong. <hi>Those that have no Bowels of tenderness</hi> towards their Bretheren, advance themselvs in Riches, Honor and Power, by Fraud and Violence. And <hi>those that have no Sense of a Diety</hi> content themselvs in these wordly Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses; and so injoy Tranquility of Minde, without looking any further. These things being so, thou wilst do wel to consider whether they do not in som measure invalidate thy reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, or interfere with thy conclusions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, they seem indeed to do it. For if the Reward of Duty do not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42266:38"/>
upon the Performance of Duty, but rather upon a Practice directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto it, then ar al the Tys of Duty broken, and Mankinde let loose to al manner of disorders. I say this seems to be the Consequence of that State of things which you have now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented. But I think I have the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that difficulty ready at hand. And, first, from the Absurdity of that consequence I argu in general, that the thing is either not so as you have represented it, or else that that Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is not necessary. For, if there were no Restraint of an inward Law in the Hearts of Men, with regard to the general Good, then would al Means of obtaining a private Advantage be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently made use of as they might appear likely to giv Success; and by that means Fraud and Violence, which reign now but in som few disorderly Persons, would then overspread the Earth, and expose al Mankind to eternal Confusion or utter Ruin:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42266:38"/>
Which Consequence I say is so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant with the infinite Wisdom and Goodness of God, that it is in no wise to be admitted. I proceed therfore to a more particular Examination of the Question: And, in the next place, <hi>I deny the Supposition, that those Men of Excess and Violence, those that have no regard either to God or Man, do ever attain to any competent Degree of tolerable Happiness.</hi> They may indeed accumulate Riches, and other world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enjoyments, but that is al they can do. Their Excesses will infallibly, by degrees, obscure and weaken their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects; and the Consciousness of the Wrong they do unto others wil gnaw their Mindes, with Jealousys and Fears of the like Returns from thse they have injured: Which is more than sufficient to corrupt their Joys. If they have any Intervals of Tranquility, it proceeds onely from a stupid senselesness; and not being built upon a tru Knowledg of their own Condition,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42266:39"/>
nor supported by any Idea of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it can be of no durance. Thus al their pretended Happiness dwindles into a meer Nothing, and so leavs the Objection arising from it without any Force. But if it should stil be urged, that these worldly Injoyments ar so accommodated to our worldly Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, in spite of al Reasoning, our very Sense wil force us to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they ar necessary Ingredients to our Happiness here; and if it be therupon argued, that the unequal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of them takes away the Force of that Law which I have al along endeavored to establish: To this I wil answer, in the last place, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the Supposition, and denying the Consequence. Grant that deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and violent Men obtain a greater Share of those things than do the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and Benign. What then? I must not immediatly reject things already proved; but rather first try whether this Supposition be really inconsistant
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42266:39"/>
therwithal or no. And in reflecting therupon, I think I see their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so easy, and so happy, that, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of loos'ning any Joint of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric, it wil prove the last Pin to fasten al the Parts of it indissolubly. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view therfore my Idea of the Divine Perfections, and from the <hi>Conjunction of Wisdom and Goodness</hi> I finde another of equal Evidence (not yet named) to result; and that is <hi>Justice.</hi> By his Justice I am assured that, <hi>if he have obliged us unto any sort of Duty by the expectation of Reward, and forbidden the contrary by fear of Punishment, he wil not, he can not, fail to confer that Reward upon al those that shal perform that Duty, and inflict that Punishment upon the Transgressors of it.</hi> Since therfore it happens that this Retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Rewards and Punishments in this World, however considerable in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, yet is not so perfectly exact in every particular, as to be voyd of al Difficulty; I hereupon cal to minde
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42266:40"/>
the Hopes I saw of <hi>a future Being,</hi> when I considered the nature of my Soul as capable of it; and now I see not onely that <hi>Possibility,</hi> but even <hi>an Absolute Necessity of the thing.</hi> For if God be perfectly Just, and if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments which his Justice ingages him to distribute or inflict, be not distributed or inflicted in this World, we must necessarily have som Subsistance hereafter, in which Estate he may distribute or inflict them; and he then wil certainly and infallibly do it. This, I say, not onely answers your Objection, but it ads a new Force to al that I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto endeavored to establish.</p>

               <p>I acknowledg it dos so. And therfore I wil now trouble thee with no more Objections, but expect the Prosecution of what thou hast further proposed unto thy self to inquire into.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Truly I do not see what further I have to prosecute. I had indeed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42266:40"/>
propounded to examin how my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, that perfect Happiness which I thirst after, would result from the observance of those Dutys that I am bound unto. But you have already brought me to the Resolution of that Inquiry. <hi>Since the Almighty God is obliged by his Own Essential Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys, upon Condition of that Observance, to confer that Happiness upon me in a future Life, I have but to walk steadily in the Way that he has prescribed</hi> (I mean in that way which the Nature of Things, the Course of universal Good, obliges me to) <hi>and I am assured that I shal not fail to obtain it.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>It is impossible for me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe that future Happiness in such a manner as those things that ar the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of my Senses, or matter of present Injoyment. But it suffices me to know
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42266:41"/>
that <hi>it wil be suited to my Soul; that therfore it wil advance the Facultys of my Soul to their highest Degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which is to say, into a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity unto the Divine Nature, from whence they sprung: And that its Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration wil be Eternal.</hi> This is an Abyss in which my Thoughts ar drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: No wonder therfore if Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fail me.</p>

               <p>I expect no more from thee. Thou hast followed thy natural Light so far as it shines with any Clearness. What further remains to be known, that may be useful in the pursuit of Hapipness, has been communicated to Mankind by Divine Revelation, and is therefore a Subject of Instruction, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Reflection: It is rather to be listned unto, than studyed for. I wil therfore som other time endeavor to explain unto thee my Conception of those things. But in the mean while I advise thee to revolv oft in thy own Minde the Force of al these Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42266:41"/>
that we have now gon tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. They wil ingage thee to an exact Performance of thy Duty in al Occasions. And <hi>the Performance of that Duty wil not onely carry along with it the Reward of a temporal Felicity, but secure an eternal one.</hi>

Since there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains further Matter to be inquired into, I can have no Rest til I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cust it. My Minde is now so war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with these Things, that there can be no Time fitter for me than the present, to continue the Meditation of them. And besides also, We ar al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready so far advanced upon our Way, that I cannot think our remaining Journey wil be very long. I earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreat you therfore to continue your Instructions, without Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the End. And seeing I am, henceforwards, to learn more directly by your Lessons, than heretofore,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42266:42"/>
while you were pleased to lead me in the Exercise of my own Reflexions; I desire you now to suffer me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such Inquirys as I finde my self least capable to comprehend; that so your Lessons, being properly suited to my Wants, may the more easily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them, and remove al Doubts or Difficultys that shal arise.</p>

               <p>Seeing thou art not wearyed with this Conversation, I am not onely willing, but shal take Pleasure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu it. I approve also of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod thou hintest at, of thy proposing, and my resolving, what Questions or Difficultys thou mayst finde needful. The Pursuit therof, with such Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Minde as thou hast hitherto exercised, wil stil lead us, in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Order, unto the End of our Way. Do thou therfore, at this time, act the Part of the <hi>Catechizer;</hi> I am content to be the <hi>Respondent.</hi>

shal use utmost Care, in the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance therof, not to transgress the Bounds of my Duty. The first Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty then, that I desire to propound, arises from your last Words. Since you acknowledg that those Discoverys which ar made by the <hi>Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ar capable to conduct a Man to eternal Felicity, <hi>I do not readily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv what furtber Need there was of any other Discovery by Divine Revelation, nor what need there is now</hi> (I say, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that Supposition) <hi>for me to look into it.</hi>

They ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have need to be instructed therin by som Person of such Credit as may
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42266:43"/>
deserv to be trusted upon his Word. And as for those who discera these Things in som measure, by the Strength of Reason, even they, too frequently, do either slip or break the fine-spun Thread of their own Consequences, and stand in need of a stronger Force to subject them unto their Duty.</p>

               <p>This has been admirably don by the coming of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> into the World: <hi>By his Doctrin, his Life, his Miracles, his Death and Resurrection.</hi> 'Tis, in a Word, the <hi>Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> which givs us new Degrees both of <hi>Light and Strength,</hi> surpassing those of common Nature.</p>

                  <hi>there ar no other Means afforded us than the hearty and sincere Compliance with those Dutys that ar required from us.</hi> I say, there ar no other Means that we our selvs can make use of, or at least, that can be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al without this. For whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver other Motives may have influenced <hi>the secret Counsels of the Almighty,</hi> to incline him to bestow that Happiness upon any Number of Men, they ar abov our Comprehension, and ought therfore to be <hi>discoursed of with great Reservedness,</hi> or rather <hi>admired in humble Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> We ar taught that <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Thou observest wel.

                  <hi>) Good should at the last Day com forth unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Life, but those who did Evil, unto the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Damnation.</hi> This, I say, was his Doctrine. And the Belief of this being of the greatest Importance, He was not content to confirm it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that general Credit which his other Miracles acquired him; but he also <note n="e" place="margin">Matt. 18. 22, 23.

               <p>You have great Reason to represent this as <hi>the utmost Force of the Gospel.</hi> It is indeed the same in kinde with that wherewithal I concluded my Disquisitions, but infinitely stronger, and more proper to incline Men's Wils, and binde them to the exact Performance of their Duty. And now I am abundantly satisfied that those several Advantages, which as you say occur unto us by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly supply those Defects and Imperfections under which our natural Condition labored. But that being so, I perceiv the great Importance of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inquiry, which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more naturally have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded these Explications of yours, but is not yet unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable. It is this. Seing the <hi>Gospel of Jesus-Christ</hi> is so
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42266:49"/>
proper and efficacious a Means to direct and help us in those Ways which lead to Eternal Happiness, I would gladly know by what kinde of Proof we may be fully, assured of its Truth: I mean, that <hi>such Things were really said and don as ar therin recorded.</hi> For there lys the Stress of the whole Matter. And it behoovs us to see that the Foundations be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sure, upon which we build so important a Structure as this is.</p>

               <p>Thou judgest rightly of the great Importance of the Inquiry thou now makest. For if the <hi>History of Jesus-Christ</hi> be not tru, then ar al Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences drawn from thence vain and frivolous. But if it be tru that he <hi>said</hi> and <hi>did</hi> what the <hi>Evangelists</hi> record of him, then are al my foregoing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42266:49"/>
strong. Now the Proof hereof appears to me most evident in the <hi>historical Series</hi> of what followed his Appearance. It is matter of fact that we inquire after: viz. <hi>That he liv'd, and taught, as is recorded of him; and that he confirmed his Teaching during his Life by Miracles; and much more after his Death, by his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> This is attested by the <hi>Apostles, Disciples, and primitive Christians:</hi> in whom therefore we ar to examin two things: First, Their <hi>Capacity</hi> to judg of what they saw and heard, (I mean onely that they did really see and hear it:) and then their <hi>Fidelity</hi> in reporting it. Now the <hi>Capacity</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to discern such apparent matters of fact as ar the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Christianity, is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power,</hi> so long til Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity over spred, in a manner, the face of the whole Earth. This is plain Matter of Fact. The Records these things, whether in the <hi>Gospel</hi> it-self, or in the <note n="f" place="margin">See the Authors quoted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Folio. 87.</note> 
                  <hi>Historys of the next succeeding Ages,</hi> do al agree in the same account therof. And fince that time, those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
<pb facs="tcp:42266:51"/>
have, through the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of several Ages, been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed unto us, with the same, or <hi>greater,</hi> certitude than any other History of such Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can boast of. I say, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the same, but <hi>greater</hi> Certitude. For the Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of other Historys ar now no where to be found but in Books or Monuments. Not onely Emperors ar dead, but their Empires also ar buryed in a confused Chaos of vicissitudes: so that there remains no living Witness, no real Effect now operating upon the mindes of men, that can be an Argument they ever subsisted. But with the History of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> it is otherwise. <hi>For the World is yet ful of living Christians. And therefore it cannot be doubted that Jesus Christ had once an existence amongst men.</hi> Unless
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42266:51"/>
som other Reason could be assigned for the spreading of his Name and Religion throughout the Earth, and the propagating of it from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation, than what I have now touched at, it must be allowed that these two Propositions, viz. That <hi>there ar now Christians in the World,</hi> and that <hi>their first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was Jesus Christ,</hi> ar chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together by the same ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity as <hi>Effect and Cause.</hi> But none have yet dared to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take so manifest an Absurdity. Even the boldest <hi>Atheists,</hi> who have attempted to giv som ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Existence of the Universe without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of a Deity, have not presumed to giv the least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation how it could be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible there should be now any such People as <hi>Christians</hi> in the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42266:52"/>
World if there had not once been such a Person as <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Therfore it is even as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to doubt that he once was (together with the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Consequences of his being) as to doubt that we our selves now ar. This is but a light Touch at som of those nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Arguments which the subject affords. But the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of it deservs thy stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Application in examining them al. Wherfore I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend those <hi>Authors</hi> who have expresly treated this matter to thy most serious Study. In them thou wilst finde al these Allegations that I hint at, and much more to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, both proved and illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Many there ar who have labored in that province: But it shal suffice me now to address thee unto those that I

               <p>Thou dost very wel. But now, before I enter upon that Answer, I think fitting to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise one Word in further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of thy Supposition, That <hi>our Eternal Happiness dos</hi>

For we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the View we ar now taking of Religion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be confined unto that Knowledg we have of it by Divine Revelation. And in this Method I think I shal establish the same Conclusion by as clear Testimony as it is possible for Words to express.

received a new Satisfaction in this clearer Conviction. But I see not yet the use you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make of it, in order to the solving my foresaid Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultys: Becaus those Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys ar grounded even upon the very Supposition that this Doctrin is tru.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Thou wilst quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv that Use. For this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, being once firmly esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, will open us an easy Passage through al manner of Obstacles. Let us apply it to thy first Inquiry. <hi>What shal we say to al the ceremonial Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of Religion?</hi> I answer, That <hi>it is just of so much tru Valu as it contributes Help to lead us in a Course of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Wil of God: And no more.</hi> For that is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing of Consequence unto us, and <hi>nothing is to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:42266:57"/>
                  <hi>further than as it has a Tendency therunto.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Since you keep so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that Rule, I beg leav to ask one Question, by the by, before we proceed any further. And it is this: <hi>Whether has this Ceremonial Outside any such real Influence upon that more substantial part of Religion which you place in Practice,</hi> or no?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yes, it has.</hi> The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Assembling of People to profess their Adoration of a supreme Deity is <hi>an Honor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely du unto that Deity,</hi> and in that Respect is it self <hi>a part of natural</hi> Religion. It is also a proper Means of preserving that <hi>awful Sense of Reverence towards the Deity in the Mindes of Men,</hi> which mightily curbs their disorderly Inclinations, and preservs Regularity and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42266:58"/>
Moderation in their very Hearts. And further, it is a great <hi>Help to the entertaining of Brotherly Lov amongst Neighbors,</hi> and therby to the Setlement and Peace and Wel-Being of Societys. These ar al essential Parts of our Duty. And therfore <hi>an external Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion, having so great an Influence therupon, ought not to be slighted.</hi> But to prevent Mistake, I wil ad this Word: That, as several Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, of Persons, of Time, and of Place, may require dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Methods of making this outward Profession, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus one may be more succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in som Occasions than in others, therfore it is not to be supposed that one and the same exact Form therof is always necessary: But that several <hi>Alterations may be allowed in</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:42266:58"/>
                  <hi>this Ceremonial Part,</hi> according to the Exigency of those Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances: And that <hi>which way soever contributes most at any time to the main End of Religion is then to be esteemed and chosen as the most perfect.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I now conceiv this wel enough. And therfore I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to proceed to my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Inquiry, which is about the more <hi>Notional Part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, those Speculative Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Belief</hi> which seem not proper to have any great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon our Practice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>To that, I say, That if those Speculations have really no Influence at al upon our Practice, then ar they to be looked upon as meer Trifles, of no real Valu. But if they have any Influence that way, then, as I said before, they ar to be had in more or less Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42266:59"/>
according as that Influence is stronger or weaker. The fundamental Point of al Points, without which the <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Apostle</hi> has observed there can be no such thing as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is <hi>the Belief of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of a Deity, and of future Rewards and Punishments.</hi> The Influence of this is Universal, it being adapted to the natural Facultys of al Mankind; and especially to work upon those main Springs of Hope, and Fear, which ar the chief Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers unto Action: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 1.16, 18.</note> called <hi>the Power of God unto Salvation:</hi> and it is in effect the powerfullest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of al others to ingage Men to their Dutys. There ar other Points also, inferior indeed to this in Strength and general Usefulness, tho of a more refined and nobler Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42266:59"/>
yet of great Efficacy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, where they ar on the one side judiciously inculcated, and on the other side received into Mindes that ar fitly disposed; Such Points or Articles (I mean) of Belief, as Work by <hi>a Principle of</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 5.8. 2 Cot. 5.14. Gal. 5. 6. Ephes. 2. 3, &amp;c. Eph. 5.2, 25 1 John 4. 9 19</note> 
                  <hi>Love,</hi> and whose particular Foundation is in <hi>Christianity.</hi> But I judg it not needful to branch out these general Heads into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Subdivisions as som have don. On the contrary, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blame the too great Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity of those Spirits, who by such like <hi>Nicetys</hi> have rendred our <hi>plain Duty an intricate Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> and by laying too great Stress upon Points of smal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have enervated the Strength of the most substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ones. Nevertheless I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn not the Intention of any Man, who, finding the Force
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42266:60"/>
of any such particular Topic upon his own Minde, makes use of it to incite himself to his Duty. Let him in that freely use his own Liberty. Onely <hi>let him not offer to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his Fancys upon other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> For, when al is don, the tru Estimate of Opinions, as wel as Ceremonys, is only to be made by their Aptitude to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence our Practice. <hi>What so ever may be helpful to us in the Performance of our Duty is to be pursued: What soever may be a Hindrance in that Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance ought to be avoided; and what soever dos neither help nor hinder may be looked upon as indifferent.</hi> But, as all Men ar not equally wrought upon by the same Motives, so there may and ought to be som La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude allowed in this kinde as wel as in the other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I intreat you, permit me to interpose one Word more before we quit this Subject. <hi>The great Indifferency which you teach me to have for Doctrins that ar meerly speculative, and the narrow Reduction of Things absolutely necessary to few Heads,</hi> which you seem to aim at, an so opposite both to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion and Practice of the most part of Christians, that I would gladly learn ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how to comport my self amongst them in those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects without Offence, or if possible, how to oppose them with yet more Strength. Wherfore if you judg any thing further may be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently added upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I beseech you not to refuse me that Satisfaction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Truly if thou attendest rightly to what I have said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42266:61"/>
there is little need of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding further. But however I wil do it in a few words, that may answer both those diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Ends which thou aimest at. And, first, in opposition to those Multiplyers of specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and abstruse Notions. Let such Men consider that <hi>the end of Religion is to help the meanest and the ignorantest of mankinde to Salvation, as wel as the richest and the learnedest. Any such Notions therfore as pass the comprehension of the meanest Capacitys ar not to be reckoned as things whose know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is of absolute and indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable necessity to every one.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus those that fall short of that comprehension would therby be excluded from a possibility of Salvation: And I may ad that it is to be feared even the subtilest of those
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42266:61"/>
                  <hi>Doctors</hi> themselves would, in som case, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> great hazard. If this simple Consideration wil not make them more modest in their speculations, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in broaching them, it may be justly doubted they ar wedded therunto by som other Ty than the bare lov of the Truth. But if they wil here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon complain of an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Injury don to them, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining their lofty Fancys to that low rank of contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which occupy the vulgar, thou mayst rectify their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take by looking back to what I have already declared unto thee, <hi>viz.</hi> that every man may make use of such specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as he findes really to have the most effectual power upon himself to ingage him to the performance of his Duty. Let that onely be their end, and in order therunto let them

freely exercise al the Facultys of their own Soules: the more the better. But I must stil repeat, that in matters of such abstracted Speculation as we now speak of, no Man ought to impose upon another. <hi>One man's Opinions ought no more to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed for the entertainment of another Man's minde, than one man's Appetiteought to be the rule of chusing food for another Man's Stomack.</hi> Whatsoever is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally found useful by every one, either for Body or Minde, may be determined to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally necessary: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else. At least (I say at leaft) nothing can be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be universally neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary which the far greatest part of Mankinde ar utterly uncapable of receiving.

               <p>What you have said, is indeed abundantly sufficient. And I wil be careful to make use of it in my own Practice, with al possible Modesty and Jnoffensiveness. Onely one Difficulty more remains, which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42266:64"/>
I have already propounded, about <hi>the Condition of those Persons who fal short of that Performance which your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Rules seem to require.</hi> But that Difficulty, I consess, seems to me very considerable, and withal somthing formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. For I am sensible of the general Defectiveness of Mankinde in that respect, and therfore dread the Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therof in my own Person. If you can free me from that Anxiety I acknowledg that my Minde wil be at great Eas; and I shal then cease from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuning you any further with such manner of Questions as these have been.</p>

               <p>Expect not that I should eas thee by any Dispensation from those Dutys which the Law of God exacts. No: <note n="a" place="margin">I Sam. 15, 22, Ps. 51.16.17,</note>

                  <hi>than Sacrifice.</hi> And I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready sufficiently proved that we can have no other certain Mark, but our Obedience, of our having <hi>any Interest in the Sacrifice even of Christ himself.</hi> That therfore is the thing that lys upon us to look after; To assure our Interest in him that way; and then we need not doubt of our participating of those Benefits which he <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>me to procure unto Mankinde. I say then, That <hi>our Obligation to actual Obedience is indispensible.</hi> But nevertheless I would not have thee look upon it with so uncomfortable a Prospect as thou seemest to do. For tho I wil acknowledg it to be <hi>hard,</hi> yet I must assert that it is <hi>not impossible</hi> to be performed. And that being so, the Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments propounded ar abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly sufficient to ingage any
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42266:65"/>
reasonable Man in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. This Argument is Copious. But I wil indeavor, as I have don hitherto, to bring al to the shortest and directest Issu that I can. Remember then that in thy natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searches, thou hast established one of the most essential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertys of the supreme Deity to be <hi>Goodness.</hi> Now observ how inconsistant it is with that Idea, to suppose him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more from us than he has capacitated us to perform. 'Tis the unjust Charge of <hi>the sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42266:66"/>
Assistances which he affords it. He expects not from us the <hi>Perfection</hi>

                  <hi>of pure Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Spirits,</hi> but such things as Men cloathed with Flesh may attain unto. And from every Man in particular he expects Performances propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of his Condition. This is perfectly reasonable in it self, and it is no less perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly established in Scripture. Our <hi>Savior</hi> declares in many places <note n="c" place="margin">Matt. 20. &amp;c. Luke 10. 12, &amp;c. Joh. 15. 22 24.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Measure of Men's Transgressions should not so much be taken by the Acts themselvs, as by the measure of Light and Conviction against which they were committed.</hi> And in one Place <note n="d" place="margin">Luke 12. 47, 8.</note> he dos it in these express Words, <hi>That the Servant who knew his Lord's Wil, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:42266:66"/>
                  <hi>Wil, should be beaten with many Stripes: But that he who knew it not, and did commit things worthy of Stripes, should be beaten but with few. For</hi> he ads <hi>unto whomsoever much is given, of him shal be much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</hi> Thus therfore it is evident that <hi>the Dutys required from us bear a</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 12. 3, &amp;c. Eph. 4. 7. &amp;c.</note>

               <p>I can not wel answer ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Argument or your Proof. But nevertheless I finde in effect, by Experience, that <hi>al Mankinde fal much short of Perfection.</hi> And therfore this seeming Appearance of it in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42266:67"/>
Theory dos not yet free me from those Anxietys which arise from its manifest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Defect.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Have Patience a little. We shal quickly com to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understanding of the thing. Thou allowest my Proof to be good, that the Perfection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from us is attainable; but yet thou affirmest that in effect it is never attained. These things ar inconsistant one with another. Let us inquire ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether there be not som <hi>Mistake in thy Notion of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> For probably it is in this as in other Debates, that the Knot lys onely in the right Explication of som Term. Our Wranglings ar ordinarily more about Words than Things, and <hi>most Men would be of the very same Minde, if they did but once rightly understand one another.</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:42266:67"/>
This Mistake of thine (for such. I presume it to be) I had designed to obviate, by telling thee already that the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence required from us is such as is suitable to the Capacity of Humane Nature. Now I desire thee to observ that if thou lookest for such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perfection in that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as is absolutely abov that Capacity, thou art in a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Error: For that can not be the Degree that is required from us. Let us see then what it is. The Expressions truly ar very comprehensive and strong: <hi>viz. That we must be Holy, Pure, and Perfect, as our Father who is in Heaven is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> Wel, what can this sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify? The absolute Perfection of God is certainly not attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by such Creatures as we ar. Wherfore the Sense of that,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42266:68"/>
and al such like Commands, must needs be, that as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Essence of God is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the highest Degree of al Perfection, so We should tend to the highest Degree of that Perfection which our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ar capable of; and that we should faithfully improve the Talents that ar put into our Hands, the Opportunitys and Advantages that ar offered us, to that purpose. <hi>This, I say, is possitively required of us, and less than this wil not serv the Trun.</hi>

               <p>I beg your excuse that I cannot yet yield a ful assent to what you drive at, until you pleas to explain more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to me <hi>what is that very degree of perfection which you say our Natures ar capable of,</hi> that so I may examin whether in effect it be ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or no.</p>

               <p>Thou dost wel: and I wil endeavor to satisfy thee. Remember then that it is <hi>not the Perfection of God, nor of Angels, but of Men: and that neither is it the same Degree of Perfection in each individual Man, but different according to Men's different capacitys.</hi> In a word, <hi>it is not</hi>

After which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise thee to dispute no longer about it, but to apply they self to practice, and let the effects therof shine forth in thy life. <hi>Sincerity is nothing else but an Honest, Upright, Hearty, and constant application of Minde, accompanied with the same faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>

                  <hi>exertion of al possible endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, to do the thing required. Tis the doing of al that possibly can be don, and not more.</hi> That this is required appears from God's demanding <hi>the whole</hi>

                  <hi>inconsistancy of his service with that of the World:</hi> I say this shows that he requires the utmost exercise of al our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the obeying of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. And where the Heart is thus sincere and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, the Intention honest, and the Minde willing, I do not say that the wil is taken, for the deed, but I affirm that the Deed is accepted according to the Measure of the Capacity, <note n="e" place="margin">Cor. 8. 12.</note>

And the <hi>Apostle Paul</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Phil. 3. 12 15.</note> in the same place where he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that <hi>he had not really attained to Perfection, but was onely pressing forwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, nevertheless accounts himself amongst the number of those that ar perfect:</hi> undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, because his endeavors were sincere and constant. Now that this sort of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is attainable is evident in it self, beyond any Proof that can be made of it. For <hi>it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but doing al that ever a Man can do.</hi> And surely no Man is so <hi>absurd as to deny the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his doing what he can do.</hi> But here it wil be good to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join, that this notion of doing al a Man can do is not a palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for gross and frequent miscarriages. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is an absolute obligation to overcom them. For there is no Man but by a constant
<pb facs="tcp:42266:70"/>
watchfulness may be so far Master of his own actions as not to fal frequently into the same known fault. Let us consider it in a familiar exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. What so common as <hi>Swearing?</hi> Now can it be doubted but any habitual Swearer may, with a strong Resolution and diligent Care, retain himself one quarter of an Hour from that Sin? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it can not. But if a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Hour, why not then half an Hour why not an Hour, a Day, a Week, a Month, a Year? The same Care wil stil produce the same Effect. And not only so, but the Work wil be more easy in the End than in the Begining. For the strength of the Habit, which in the Begining swayd power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sully towards Vice, and made the first Resistance difficult,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42266:70"/>
wil in the End help as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually towards the Work of Reformation, and make the Conquest easy. Then wil be experienced the Truth of those Sayings. <hi>That the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christ ar not</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">I Iohn 5.3.</note> 
                  <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, but that his</hi>

                  <hi>Yoke is easy and his Burden light.</hi> And what I say on this particular Instance of Swearing wil hold in al other known Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fions. <hi>Resolution and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness wil overcom them.</hi> He that makes it as much his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to reform his Life as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other dos to learn some Trade, or Art, wil succeed as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in that Design as the other in this. The one may fail now and then: But in the main he practises his Art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, and is therfore reputed a perfect Master. And so the other, tho he be not exempt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42266:71"/>
from al possibility of Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, yet he can not chuse but attain to <hi>such a Conquest over Sin, as that it shal have no longer any</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Rom, 6.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Rule over him,</hi> and to such a general and habitual Practice of Vertu as may truly denominate him a righteous Person. And do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, that Man may have Comfort; for the Scripture is most evidently clear that <hi>his</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Prov. 28. 13. Is. 1.16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is. 55. 7. Ez. 3.18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ez. 18. Ez. 33, Rom. 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>former Transgressions shal be no longer imputed unto him, but that by Perseverance in an habitual Course of wel-doing he shal save his Soul.</hi> Thus then, I say, this Perfection is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable; and with it, Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. The Importance is, That we apply our selvs hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to the Work: For where such Application is <hi>real,</hi> it fails not to be <hi>effectual.</hi> In the last Place, I have promised to shew
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42266:71"/>
