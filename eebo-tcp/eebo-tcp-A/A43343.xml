            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Concerning
SCHISM.</head>
            <p>THere hath scarce been any one
thing that hath been bandi'd
to and fro in the Christian
world with more Heat and
Noise among the several Dividing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
than the charge of <hi>Schism.</hi> This hath
involv'd the disputing part of the Church
in the most violent Engagements above
1200 years. Schism is so deform'd a
Brat, that no body hath been willing
to own it; a Crime so very black, that
each Party hath been studiously industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to clear it self from the charge. To
this Indictment all have pleaded <hi>Not
Guilty,</hi> and we find none that have <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
But here's the Misery, such no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32875:3"/>
of it have been entertain'd, that
it hath been almost impossible to deny,
without recriminating. And perhaps
the most guilty have been most hot in
charging others. <hi>Athaliah</hi> the greatest
Traitor is most loud in crying, <hi>Treason,
Treason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are all agreed that Schism is an
<hi>Arch-Rebel</hi> in Christ's Kingdom, but in
sending out the Hue and Cry after it,
the Difficulty is, how to <hi>describe</hi> it; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Attempts have been made; would
it be in vain to try one more? Wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Enquiries into the several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions
and Descriptions which have
been given of it, let us have recourse
to the Law and to the Testimony, for
whosoever speak in the things of God
(as they certainly do who speak of Sin
and Duty) if they speak not according
to that Rule, it is because there is no
Light in them.</p>
            <p>Therefore I only premise this one
<hi>Postulatum,</hi> That nothing is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
sin, but that which is made so
by the Word of God: <hi>Tekel</hi> is to be
written upon nothing but that which
hath been carefully weigh'd in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances
of the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:32875:3"/>In our Enquiry what is Sin, let
these Books be open'd which must be
open'd at the great day. If Sinners
must be judg'd by those Books short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
let sin be judg'd by them now, and
let not any Man or Company of men
in the world assume a power to declare
that to be sin which the Sovereign
Rector of the world hath not declared
to be so lest in so doing they be found
stepping into the Throne of God who
is a Jealous God, and will not give
this Branch of his Glory to another.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore see what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
saith concerning Schism, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Evil of it, we are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of that, but concerning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>The Old Testament will not help us
so much in this enquiry as the New,
for as to the binding of the <hi>Jews</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
only in one place, at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and
to offer only upon that Altar, it was a
Precept purely Ceremonial, and to us
Christians is vacated by that Gospel rule
which wills us to pray every where,
and their Synagogues then (not their
Temple) were the Patterns of Christian
Assemblies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:32875:4"/>Only one Scripture occurs in the Old
Testament, which perhaps will help-to
rectify some mistake about Schism. It
is the instance of <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> who
prophesi'd in the Camp, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.
26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The case in short is this: <hi>Eldad</hi>
and <hi>Medad</hi> were persons upon whom
<hi>the Spirit rested, i. e.</hi> Who were by the
extraordinary working of the Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with gifts equal to the rest of the
seventy Elders, and were <hi>written, i. e.</hi>
Had a call to the work, but they <hi>went
not out unto the Tabernacle</hi> as the rest did,
though God himself had appointed that
they should, <hi>v.</hi> 16. And <hi>they prophesi'd in
the Camp, i. e.</hi> Exercis'd their gifts in
private among their Neighbours, in
some common Tent. Upon what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
they did this, doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
but it is evident that it was their
weakness and infirmity thus to separate
from the rest of their Brethren. If any
think they prophesied by a necessitating,
and irresistible Impulse, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that <hi>the Spirit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
is subject to the Prophets, 1 Cor.</hi>
14. 32.</p>
            <p>Now if some of the <hi>Schismaticating
Doctors</hi> that the Church hath known
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32875:4"/>
had but had the censuring of <hi>Eldad</hi> and
<hi>Medad</hi> we should soon have had a  Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given against them much more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
than would have been awarded to
him that gather'd Sticks on the Sabbath
day.</p>
            <p>And 'tis confessed, all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
consider'd it looks like a very
great Irregularity, especially as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement
of the Authority of <hi>Moses,</hi>
which they that prophesi'd in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
under his Presidency manifestly
own'd and submitted to.</p>
            <p>Well, an Information was presently
brought in against them, <hi>v. 27. Eldad</hi>
and <hi>Medad Prophesie in the Camp,</hi> that
is, to speak in the invidious language of
the times there's a Conventicle at such a
place, and <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> are holding
forth at it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joshua</hi> in his zeal for that which he
fancy'd to be the Churches Unity, and
out of a concern for the authority of
<hi>Moses</hi> brings in a Bill to silence them,
for as hot as he was he would not have
them fin'd and laid in the Jail for this
disorder neither; only, <hi>My Lord</hi> Moses,
<hi>forbid them;</hi> not, compel them to come
to the Tabernacle, if they be not satisfi'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32875:5"/>
to come, only for the future prohibit
their Schismatical Preaching in the
Camp. This seem'd a very good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But hold <hi>Joshua, thou knowest not what
manner of Spirit thou art of.</hi> Discerning
<hi>Moses</hi> sees him acted by a Spirit of envy,
and doth not only deny, but severely
reprove the motion, <hi>v. 29. Enviest thou
for my sake? Would God that all the Lords
People were Prophets,</hi> provided the Lord
will but <hi>put his Spirit upon them.</hi> He is
so far from looking upon it as Schism,
that he doth not only tolerate but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
it. And O that all those who sit
in <hi>Moses</hi> Chair, were but cloth'd with
this Spirit of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Instance is full to shew that all is
not Schism which even wise and good
men are apt to think is so.</p>
            <p>But our special enquiry must be in
the New Testament, and forasmuch as
Words are the significations of things
let us see what the Scripture means by
this word, <hi>Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Criticks</hi> observe, that the
Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is used 8 times in the
New Testament.</p>
            <p>1. In a literal sense, for a rent in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32875:5"/>
               <hi>Matth. 9. 16. Mark</hi> 2. 21. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>the rent is made worse.</hi> In the same sense
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is us'd, <hi>Joh. 19. 24. Luk.</hi> 5. 36. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of the rending of the Vail, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 41.
the cleaving of the Rocks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 51.
the breaking of the Net, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 11. the
cleaving of the Heavens, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 10. But
this makes little to our purpose.</p>
            <p>2. It is us'd figuratively for a Division;
and that twofold.</p>
            <p>1. A Division in apprehension; so <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
is us'd, <hi>Joh. 7. 43. Joh.</hi> 9. 16. 10. 19. in
which places it signifies the different
thoughts and apprehensions that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or their Rulers had concerning Christ
some thinking well of him, others not.
Some accusing him, others excusing
him.</p>
            <p>In this sense <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is us'd, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 7.
For the different sentiments the people
had concerning <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this diversity of opinion, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or apprehension cannot be call'd
or look't upon in its self a thing Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:
inasmuch as there are many things
which either because they are dark and
obscure, and so not capable of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
or because they are trivial and
of light moment, and so not worth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32875:6"/>
it is no matter what opinion
men are of concerning them.</p>
            <p>Only where the matter is weighty,
and toucheth the Fundamentals of
Christianity, there an error is Criminal,
and if stubbornly persisted in, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</p>
            <p>But the evil of it lies not in the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
but in the erroneousness and danger
of the opinion.</p>
            <p>I cannot believe that the greatest wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipers
of the <hi>Diana</hi> of their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
will be so sottish as to brand those
for Schismaticks who in every <hi>punctilio</hi>
of Opinion are not exactly of the same
Standard with themselves.</p>
            <p>If there be any so strangely rigid, <hi>Let
not my Soul come into their secret,</hi> for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
to see even all the Saints of a
mind in every thing till they come to
Heaven.</p>
            <p>It doth therefore evidence too great
a strangeness to the Spirit of the Gospel,
to condemn all those who differ from
us only in their apprehensions about
little things. <hi>John</hi>'s Disciples were huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
displeas'd because <hi>Christ</hi>'s Disciples
did not fast so often as they did, and
quarrel'd with Christ himself about it,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32875:6"/>
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 14. And the answer of the meek
and holy Jesus is worthy remark, that
he gives a good reason why his disciples
did not fast, <hi>viz.</hi> Because <hi>the bridge groom,
was yet with them.</hi> and yet doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<hi>John</hi>'s Disciples that fasted oft,
which teacheth us not to make our own
Opinions and Practices (like <hi>Procrustes</hi>'s
Bed) the Standard by which to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
all other, and that in such cases we
are to think it sufficient only to acquit
our selves, first to our own consciences,
and then if need be to the world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
condemning others who think and
practise otherwise in such little things,
and perhaps have as much reason for
their Thoughts and Practises as we have
for our's.</p>
            <p>2. A Division in Affection; and in
this sense it is us'd three times in the first
Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and no where
else in all the New Testament.</p>
            <p>We must particularly examine each
place, that thence we may be furnish't with
a true notion of Schism; and in plain
terms the case is whether a diversity (or
if you will call it so, a separation) of
Communion be the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of
Schism.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:32875:7"/>1. I find the word, and with it no
doubt the thing, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 10. I beseech
you brethren—that there be no divisions
(<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)</hi> no <hi>Schisms</hi> among you; so reads
the margin of our Bibles.</p>
            <p>Now to find out what this Schism is,
let us enquire,</p>
            <p>1. Into the Exegetical exhortations
that accompany it.</p>
            <p>(1.) <hi>That ye all speak the same thing; viz.</hi>
In the fundamental Doctrines of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
for in little things it can never be
made a duty to be of the same opinion,
since it is morally impossible; but (as
<hi>Estius</hi> seems to understand it) not to
break Christian Charity in your disputes
about them.</p>
            <p>Observe, He doth not oblige us to
think the same thing, but though your
thoughts be divers, yet speak the same
thing; <hi>i. e.</hi> In your preaching and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
speak of those things only where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you are agreed, and for those things
wherein you differ, do not fall out and
fight about them, but love one another
notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>(2.) <hi>That ye be perfectly join'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the same mind and in the same Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Which must be understood of a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32875:7"/>
serious endeavour after it, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a perfect Conjunction must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
for a world of everlasting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>But the meaning of the Exhortation
seems to be that all their little heats
and animosities should be swallow'd up
in an unanimous zeal for the great
Gospel Truths wherein they were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.</p>
            <p>2. We must enquire into the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
miscarriage which occasion'd this
caution, which you have, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. there
were <hi>contentions</hi> among them, <hi>v.</hi> 11.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> So that <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Contentions</hi> are
one and the same thing, and tis worth
nothing that <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Epistle of his to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> still
calls <hi>Schisms,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, contentions.</p>
            <p>Now the contention was about their
Ministers; <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> saith one, I am
of <hi>Apollos,</hi> saith another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now he
that was <hi>of Apollos</hi> was as much a Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
as he that was of <hi>Paul,</hi> because
they quarrel'd and fell out about so small
and indifferent a matter.</p>
            <p>Observe, It was not so much <hi>being</hi> of
<hi>Paul,</hi> and being of <hi>Apollos</hi> that made the
Schism, for <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:32875:8"/>
were all their's, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 22. But <hi>saying,
I am of</hi> Paul, that is, crying him up as the
only man for them, so as to despise o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
If one went to hear <hi>Paul,</hi> and
another went to hear <hi>Apollos,</hi> that did not
make a Schism, no nor if one commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
with <hi>Paul,</hi> and another with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos,</hi>
for why might not each go where
he could be most edify'd? but the Schism
was, that they sacrific'd Christian Love
and Charity to this difference of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension.
This is evident in that those
who said, <hi>I am of Christ,</hi> so as to despise
and censure, and quarrel with them that
said, I am of <hi>Paul &amp;c.</hi> are reproved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
with the rest.</p>
            <p>Now the way of curing this Schism
was not to silence <hi>Apollos</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> that
whether they would or no they might
all be of <hi>Paul;</hi> nay it is well worth the
observing, that in the same Epistle we
find <hi>Paul</hi> very earnest with <hi>Apollos</hi> to go
to <hi>Corinth 16. 12. As touching</hi> Apollos,
<hi>I greatly desir'd him to come to you.</hi> Which
he would never have done if he had not
prefer'd the common Interest of Soul's
Salvation before his own credit.</p>
            <p>But the way to cure this was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them of the folly of their quarrels,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32875:8"/>
how senseless and irrational they were,
and to perswade them to lay aside their
enmities and heart-burnings, and to love
one another, and to walk hand in hand
in the same way, though they traced dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
paths, which they might well do
when the paths lay so very near together.</p>
            <p>By this instance it appears that narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiritedness
which confines Religion and
the Church to our way and party, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is, to the condemning of others
that differ from us in little things is the
great Schismaticating principle which
hath been so much the bane of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church, <hi>hinc illae-lachrymae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We find the word us'd, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
18. <hi>I hear there be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Divisions among
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is undeniably evident that it cannot
be meant of any breach of Communion,
for it is said expresly, <hi>v.</hi> 20. That they
<hi>came together into one place,</hi> and that <hi>into
the Church too, i. e.</hi> The place of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But the Schisms were Quarrels and
Contentions about some little things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the circumstances of publick
Worship, and the quarrel seems to have
been about the time of beginning their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32875:9"/>
worship, especially when they were to
joyn in the Lords Supper, or their Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feasts,
it see as they did not come exactly
at the time, therefore the Apostle bids
them <hi>tarry one for another, v.</hi> 33. Those
that came early quarrel'd with those that
came late, for coming no sooner, and
those that came late quarrel'd with the
other, for beginning before they came.</p>
            <p>Some quarrels of this kind were the
Schisms here spoken of.</p>
            <p>3. The word is us'd, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 25.
<hi>That there be no Schism in the Body.</hi> The
Apostle is there carrying on a Metaphor
betwixt the Natural Body, and the
Church, and this clause clearly relates to
the Natural Body, for he doth not come
to the Reddition of the comparison till
<hi>v.</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>Now what he means by the <hi>Schism in
the body</hi> is plain from the <hi>Antithesis</hi> in the
following words—<hi>but that the members
should have the same care one for another,</hi>
So that when the members care not one
for another, when the Eye saith to the
hand, I have no need of thee, <hi>v.</hi> 21.
When there is not a sympathy and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feeling
among Christians <hi>v.</hi> 26. here's
Schism.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:32875:9"/>That's Schism which breaks or slackens
the bond by which the members are knit
together.</p>
            <p>Now that Bond is not an Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in point of Communion in the
same Modes and Ceremonies, but true
Love and Charity, in point of affection,
'Tis Charity that is the <hi>bond of perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
Col. 3. 14. 'Tis the <hi>Unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
that is the <hi>bond of peace, Eph.</hi> 4. 3. And
Schism is that which breaks this Bond.</p>
            <p>Now from all this laid together, I
draw out this description of Schism,
which according to my present appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
is the true Scripture notion of
it.</p>
            <q>Schism is an uncharitable Distance, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
or Alienation of Affections among
those who are called Christians, and agree
in the Fundamentals of Religion, occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
by their different apprehensions about
little things.</q>
            <p>This is the Schism which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
makes to be a sin, and by Scripture
Rules it must be judged. <hi>Schism</hi> (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Root of all other sin) we see
lies in the Heart and Affections: But the
Tree is known by his fruits; this bitter
root bears Gall and Wormwood: Let us
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32875:10"/>
therefore take a short view of those pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
which according to this Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are Schismatical practices.</p>
            <p>1. Judging, censuring, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those that differ from us in little
things is a Schismatical practice, as it
evidenceth a great alienation, if not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the Affections. <hi>Charity thinketh
no evil, 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, doth
not <hi>reason evil,</hi> doth not study to make
sins, but cover them; and if they be made,
yet not to make the worst of them; it
puts the best construction upon words
and actions.</p>
            <p>Now to pass a censorious Judgment
upon others, and to put the worst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
upon what they say and do, is
certainly uncharitable, that is, Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
It is a practice often condemn'd in
holy Writ, <hi>Mat. 7. 1. Judge not, that ye
be not judged:</hi> 'tis construed a <hi>judging of
the Law, Jam.</hi> 4. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>'Tis especially condemn'd with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the present case, of different
apprehensions about little things, in that
famous Scripture, <hi>Rom. 14. 4, 5, &amp;c.</hi> a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which if well studi'd and liv'd up
to, would heal us all. Judging the Heart,
is in my Eye, one of the most unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32875:10"/>
species of Judging. Censuring the
Principles and ends of an action, which
are secret: charging those that differ
from us with Hypocrisie, which is a
heart-sin. If the shews be good, and the
outside justifiable, when we conclude
Hypocrisie is in the heart, we step into
the Throne of God.</p>
            <p>2. Laying a greater stress upon small
matters of difference than they will bear,
and widening the breach about them. As
on the one hand, to censure all Prayers <hi>by
a Form,</hi> or by this Form in particular, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superstition,
will-worship, formality, and
the like: on the other hand, to censure
all <hi>Extempore</hi> praying as babbling, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
froth and noise, as if God had not
accepted his own People in the one as
well as in the other. The fastening of a
Censure, and passing of a Judgment upon
a whole party and way, if it be not very
clear and well-grounded indeed, will be
likely to split us upon the Rock of Schism
and Uncharitableness.</p>
            <p>3. Concluding hardly as to the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
state and condition of those that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from us, excluding them out of the
Church, and from Salvation, because they
are not just of our mind in every punctilio.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:32875:11"/>Witness that notion which excludes
out of the Church, &amp; consequently out of
Heaven all those (how orthodox and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
soever they are otherwise) who are
not in Prelatical Communion; if no Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan
Bishops, then no Ministers, no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
no Church, no Salvation.
Which is certainly the most Schismatical
notion that ever was broach'd in the
Christian world.</p>
            <p>4. Reproaching, reviling, and railing at
those who differ from us in little things,
is another Schismatical practice: fastning
such nick-names upon them, and loading
them with such reproaches as carry in
them all the <hi>odium</hi> that malice can infuse
into them; dressing them up in Bears-Skins
and then baiting them, doing
what we can by calumnies, and misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
to alienate the affections of
others from them.</p>
            <p>5. Making, consenting to, approving
or executing of Penal Laws against those
who differ from us in little things, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them for such difference in their
Persons, Estates or Liberties is another
uncharitable or Schismatical practice.</p>
            <p>This is contention with a witness—
which aims at no less than the ruin of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32875:11"/>
the person contended with in the dearest
of his secular interests, to beat out his
brains, because his head is not exactly of
our size.</p>
            <p>6. Separation from Communion with
those that we have joyn'd our selves to,
without cause; give me leave to call it
<hi>Separation for Separation sake,</hi> without any
regard had to any thing amiss in the
Church we separate from, or any thing
better in that we joyn our selves to,
this is an evidence of an uncharitable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienation
of affection, and is consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Schismatical. When we quite cast off
Communion with our brethren, out
of ambition, animosity ot their persons,
affectation of Novelty and Singularity,
or the like.</p>
            <p>This was manifestly the case of the
<hi>Donatists,</hi> the infamous Schismaticks of
the Primitive Church. Their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
were, that the Church of Christ was
to be found no where but in their Sect,
and all other Churches were no Churches
that true Baptism was not administred
but among them, and a great many
barbarous outrages they committed in
the heat of their separation.</p>
            <p>7. An affected strangeness or distance
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32875:12"/>
in Communion or Conversation from
those who thus differ from us upon the
account of such difference, avoiding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
and familiarity with them, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it strangely towards them, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do not wear the dividing
name of our party.</p>
            <p>This evidenceth an uncharitable alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of affection prevailing in the heart,
and is consequently Schismatical.</p>
            <p>Many such like practices might easily
be mention'd, if it were needful—but
they are obvious enough, especially if
we look into the Laws of Charity set
down, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, 5, 6, 7. And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that all transgression of those laws is
uncharitableness, and when that is found
in the things of Religion, it is <hi>Schism.</hi>
The corollary from the whole is this, that
whoever they be that allow themselves
in these or the like practices and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
towards their brethren that differ
from them in little things, whether they
be <hi>Episcopal, Presbyterian, Independent</hi> or
by what name or title soever they are
self-dignify'd and distinguish't, they are
so far Schismatical, inasmuch as they
break the great Law of Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:32875:12"/>Let us try what further Inference
may be drawn from this Scripture noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Schism.</p>
            <p>1. If this be Schism, then it is not
within the line of any Humane Power to
make that separation to be Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
which was not so in itself. By the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
given of Schism it doth appear
to be a thing, <hi>malum in se,</hi> which was not
so before, an attempt of that kind would
sink with its own weight. And therefore
it is well worthy observation, that when
the Parliament made a Law against Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,
(which are the great Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Eye-sores) they call'd it an Act to
prevent and suppress <hi>Seditious</hi> Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
knowing it to be within their
line to declare a thing to be Sedition,
but not <hi>Schismatical</hi> Conventicles, for
that was a thing in which they could not
concern themselves.</p>
            <p>2. If this be Schism then the guilt of
it is to be look't for in particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and is not to be charg'd by whole
sale upon parties of any denomination
whatsoever, as among us at this day, in
the prelatical party there are some
Schismatical, and others not, and the same
is to be said of the separating party, nay
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32875:13"/>
who is there that can say, I have made
my heart clean, I am pure from this sin.
Have we not all need to pray, <hi>From Envy,
Hatred and Malice, and all uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
(which are the Ingredients of
<hi>Schism) Good Lord deliver us,</hi> both from
the Guilt, and from the power of it?
It is not so much our differences them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as the mismanagement of our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
that is the bane of the Church
burning up Christian love with the fire
of our contentions.</p>
            <p>Whence come these <hi>Wars and Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?
come they not hence, even from our lusts?
Jam.</hi> 4. 1. And those that say they are
perfectly free from these warfaring,
Schismaticating lusts must give me leave
to say, I doubt they deceive themselves,
and the truth is not in them.</p>
            <p>3. If this be Schism, then there may
be Schism, where there's no separation
of Communion, that's plain from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> who came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<hi>into one place</hi> and yet are blam'd
for being Schismatical; bringing people
to one place will never cure a Schism,
till they are brought to be of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
            <p>You may bind the Leopard and lay
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32875:13"/>
him down by the Lamb, and yet the
enmity remain as great as ever, except
there be an inward change.</p>
            <p>A quarrel about little things may
likewise be Schismatical on one side,
and yet not on 'tother; <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was a
man of strife and contention, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 10.
<hi>i. e.</hi> A man striven and contended with,
and yet no Schismatick, though ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
(as it is commonly said of dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
differences) there's fault more or
less on both sides.</p>
            <p>4. If this be Schism then there may
be Separation of Communion where
there is no Schism. For thus we all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that there may be difference of
apprehension, and yet no Schism, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it do not eat out Christian love,
but be manag'd amicably, as betwixt
the Arminians and Calvinists in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and divers the
like.</p>
            <p>Now if this difference of apprehension
relate to Worship, or Communion, and
the Modes or Terms thereof, these can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be a strong inclination to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in whole or in part according as the
difference of apprehension is, for do
what we can as long as we are ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32875:14"/>
creatures the understanding will
have the directing of the will.</p>
            <p>Now surely this separation, (if we
must call it so, or rather) this variety
and diversity of Worship and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
may be manag'd without Schism,
provided Christian Love and Charity be
kept entire notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>For can any imagine that a difference
of apprehension in regard of Worship
and Discipline should be more Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
than difference of apprehension
in Doctrine, since of the two Doctrinal
Truths seem more Essential to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>But to come a little closer. The
meetings of the Dissenters (though now
blessed be God permitted and allow'd
by the Law of the Land, yet) are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
charg'd with being Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
the great out-cry is, that we leave
the Church and the unthinking mobile
who are so well taught as to know no
other Churches but the publick places of
worship, are easily induc'd to believe it,
as if 'twere Schism to worship God any
where else, let the worship there be what
it will.</p>
            <p>Those who will a low themselves
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:32875:14"/>
the liberty of an unprejudic'd thought,
cannot but see the difference so small,
that as long as we believe the same
Christian Faith, and agree in the same
Protestant abhorrence of Papal Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
we may easily be look't upon as
one and the same Church, as well as
two several Parish Churches may, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
being united under the Care
and Protection of one Protestant King,
and members of the same Protestant
Common wealth.</p>
            <p>Now 1. I do from the bottom of
my Soul detest and abhor all Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Parish Churches to Atheism,
Irreligion, and Sensuality, <hi>Jude</hi> 19.
<hi>Who separate themselves, sensual—</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the Church to go to the Ale-house
or Tavern, or to their secular business,
or to their slothfulness and laziness, to
<hi>separate unto that shame, Hos.</hi> 9. 10. And
if this separation had been more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverted
upon than it hath been of
late, probably the cure of Schism would
have been sooner effected thereby than
by severities that have been us'd against
Conscientious Separatists.</p>
            <p>2. I do likewise abhor all Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
that is, Uncharitable, Proud, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32875:15"/>
rigid separation, such separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as theirs who condemn the Parish
Churches as no parts of the visible
Church, who rail at the Ministers as
Babylonish, and Antichristian; this is a
horrid breach of the Law of Christian
Love, and that which every good
heart cannot but rise at the thoughts
of.</p>
            <p>And yet I cannot but say, and am sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
in it, that there may be a lawful
and justifiable separation (though I
would rather call it a diversity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion)
from the Parish Churches
which I shall endeavour to clear in three
cases.</p>
            <p>1. If my own Conscience be not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
in the lawfulness of any terms
of Communion impos'd, as far as I fall
under that imposition, I may justify a
separation from them, and a joyning
with other Churches where I may be
freed from that Imposition, provided
that this be not done Schismatically,
<hi>i. e.</hi> With heat and bitterness, and an
alienation of Christian affection; and I
hope none that have the law of Christ
written in their hearts will say that it is
impossible truly to love those with whom
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32875:15"/>
I am not satisfy'd to joyn in all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
for the sake of some Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
with which after all my Study,
Prayer, and Converse I cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd</p>
            <p>So, if I be a Minister, and as such
oblig'd to Preach the Gospel, yet kept
out from the publick exercise of my
Ministry by such Terms and Conditions,
Oaths and Subscriptions as I judge sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
in such a case surely it is lawful
for me with <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy
in the Camp,</hi> since in my Judgment
the door of the Tabernacle is made
straiter than my Master hath appointed
it to be made. What should hinder but
that as a Minister of Christ I may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
all the Ordinances according
to Christs Institution to those who are
willing to joyn with me, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under my Conduct (such as it is)
in those administrations. If God have
given though but one talent, it must
be traded with, or else there will be
an uncomfortable reckoning shortly, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
when we look abroad and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how the apparent necessities of
precious Souls call for our utmost di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in our Masters work, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32875:16"/>
there's work enough for us all if
God would give us hearts to be serious
and unanimous in it.</p>
            <p>In this also 'tis always provided, that
my agency in a Ministerial Station be
not made Schismatical by my Heat, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and Bitterness, but that I live in
true Love and Charity with those
whom by reason of the Impositions I
cannot <hi>salvâ conscientiâ</hi> joyn with in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>2. Though I be satisfy'd in the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of the Terms of Communion
requir'd, and so when purer admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
are not to be had may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than live in the total want of the
Ordinances comply with them, yet when
I have an opportunity of enjoying those
Ordinances in a way which I judge more
pure and Scriptural, or which I think
more lively and edifying, and more
likely to attain the great end of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
and that contribute more to
my Comfort and Holiness, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God, in such a case I cannot
see but that I may lawfully have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to such administrations though
thereby I may seem to separate from
another Church, wherein before I had
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32875:16"/>
joyn'd, and for which I still retain a
very charitable opinion and affection.
If the Magistrate should be so unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as to impose upon me an unskilful
Physician to be alone made use of in
case of sickness, I might take him rather
than none. But if there be another who
I am sure hath more Skill and Will to
help me, I think I should be accessary
to the ruin of my health and life if I
should not make use of him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
such an Inhibition.</p>
            <p>And is not the life and health and
salvation of my immortal Sonl dearer
to me than any other concern? Is not
Communion with God the sweetest
and most precious of all my delights?
Is it not the Life of my Soul, and the
Crown of all my joys? and are not
those administrations most desirable in
which I find my self most edifyed? Must
I then be such an enemy to my own
comfort and happiness as to throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all the opportunities which I might
have of that kind only in a complement?
<hi>Amicus Socrates, Amicus Plato, sed magis
amica veritas.</hi> The Bishops are my
Friends, and the Ministers my Friends,
and I have a true Love for them, but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32875:17"/>
Charity begins at home, especially when
my precious Soul more worth than all
the world lyes at stake.</p>
            <p>This case is somewhat the clearer in
those Parishes where the publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
are either Ignorant, Profane or
Malignant.</p>
            <p>3. Nay, suppose I am so well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
in Communion with the Parish
Churches in all administrations, as not
to desire better, or not to expect bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Dissenters meetings, yet I
cannot see what Schism, <hi>i. e.</hi> what
breach of Christian Love and Charity
there is in it for me to be present some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the Congregations of the sober
Dissenters, and to joyn with them who
worship the same God, in the name of
the same Mediator, read and preach the
same Word, and live in hopes of the
same Inheritance, and differ from me
only in some little things which I think
not worth contending for, scarce worth
the mentioning, hereby to evidence my
universal Love and Catholick Charity,
and that I am not of narrow, Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
dividing Principles, nor one that
will Sacrifice Christian love to the pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
trifling Fancies and Interests of a party.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:32875:17"/>The sober Dissenters are such as I
have reason to hope have Communion
with God in what they do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
why should not I now and then
have Communion with them? <hi>In every
Nation be that fears God, and works righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
is accepted of him;</hi> and why should
he not be accepted of me, why may
not I have fellowship with them that
have fellowship with the Father and
with his Son Jesus Christ? 1 <hi>John.</hi> 1. 3.
To fancy Schism, <hi>i. e.</hi> Uncharitable
contention and a breach of Christian
Love in this is very absurd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But hereby I encourage a Schism,
and countenance them in their Separation
from that which in my eye is lawful and
good, and doth not give just cause for such a
Separation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There must be grains of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
for difference of apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Different Capacities, Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Inclinations, Custom and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Education must be put into the
scale, and while I walk according to
the light which God hath given me,
I must charitably believe that others do
so too.</p>
            <p>Whether the Dissenters Meetings be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32875:18"/>
as to the constitution and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>esse</hi> of them
(looking upon them only as diversities
of Communion) Schismatical, hath been
consider'd already, and found otherwise,
by Scripture-Light.</p>
            <p>The common outcry is that it is the
setting up of <hi>Altar against Altar,</hi> which
is not so, for at the most it is but Altar
by Altar, and though I have often read
of one Body, and one Spirit, and one
Hope, and one Lord, and one Faith,
and one Baptism, and one God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. Yet I could never
find a word in all the New Testament
of one Altar, except <hi>Jesus Christ, Heb.</hi>
13. 10. The Altar that sanctifies every
Gift, in whom we all centre. And if
there be any of the Dissenters who are
<hi>Schismatical, i. e.</hi> Contentious, Bitter,
and Uncharitable in their Separation,
let them bear their own burthen, but by
my presence with them I encourage that
in them no more than I do too much of
a like Spirit in too many of those who
are call'd the Church of <hi>England</hi> men, by
my adherence to them.</p>
            <p>To conclude, By all this it is evident
that Unity of Affection is the thing to
be labour'd after more than Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:32875:18"/>
in Modes and Ceremonies. We
have been long enough trying to root
Schism out of the Church, <hi>vi &amp; armi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
by Impositions, Fines and Penalties,
choking our brethren because their
Throats have not been so wide as ours.
And it hath been found ineffectual, even
in the judgment of our Great <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi>
who have declar'd that giving ease to
scrupulous consciences is the likeliest
way to unite their Majesties Protestant
Subjects in Interest and Affection; what
if we should now try another Method
and turn the Stream of our endeavours
into another Channel? Hitherto we
have been as it were striving which
should hate one another most, what if
we should now strive which should love
one another best, and be most ready to
do all Offices of true Charity and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and bury all our little Feuds and
Animosities in that blessed grave of
Christian Love and Charity?</p>
            <p>What if we should every one of us of
each party (as we have been too often
call'd) set our selves by our Preaching
to promote and propagate the <hi>Gospel of
Peace,</hi> and by our prayers to prevail with
God for a more plentiful pouring out of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32875:19"/>
the <hi>Spirit of Peace,</hi> that the dividing
names of <hi>Baalim</hi> may be taken out of our
mouths, and that however it goes with
Uniformity of Ceremony, we may
keep the <hi>Vnity of the Spirit;</hi> and then I
doubt not but we should soon see our
<hi>English Jerusalem</hi> Establish't a praise in
the midst of the Earth.</p>
            <p>And yet I am afraid even Saints
will be men, there will be remainders
even of those corruptions which are the
seed of Schism, in the best, till we all
come to the perfect man.</p>
            <p>And that's the comfort of my Soul
that if we can but once get to Heaven
we shall be for ever out of the noise and
hurry of this quarrelsom, contentious, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
world, and the Church <hi>Triumphant</hi>
shall be no more <hi>Militant,</hi> but that happy
World of Everlasting <hi>Light</hi> will be a
World of Everlasting <hi>Love.</hi>
