            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADVICE
HOW TO PLANT
TOBACCO IN ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND,
AND HOW TO BRING
IT TO THE COLOVR AND PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
to whom it may bee
profitable, and to whom
harmefull.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue heard it reported,
by men of good iudgment,
that there is paid out of
England and Ireland, neere
the value of two hundred
thousand pounds euery
yeare for Tobacco; and that
the greatest part thereof is
bought for ready money. Sure I am, that when
our Englishmen for these seuen or eight yeares
last past, traded for it at <hi>Trinidado,</hi> or in <hi>Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noque,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:11660:3"/>
that great store of Gold, Siluer, Coine,
and plate was carried hence, and giuen to the
Spaniard there in exchange. For so greedy
were our English of the Indian Tobacco; as
where in the beginning of our traffique there,
some yeares since, the Spaniards (as in all new
plantations) were prest with all sorts of wants; &amp;
had neither cloathes to couer them, nor shooes
to tread on, nor bread to eate; and did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
exchange their Tobacco for Fish, Wine,
Aqua-vitae, all sorts of lasting food, for woollen
stockins, hats, threed, hatchets, &amp; the like: they
became in a short time so cloyd with all these
commodities, as nothing (some Silkes, and
Cloath of Siluer and Gold excepted) but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Money, and Siluer plate could content
them.</p>
            <p>This Trade therefore, where the Treasure of
this land is vented for smoke, cannot but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preiudice the Common-weale: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it were in some sort tollerable, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that many shippes and Mariners were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
and that thereby wee kept our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the West Indies, and bred many suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Marriners: yet seeing the Spaniards
haue now vtterly banished our Merchants, and
put all to the sword, or to a more cruell death,
which they can maister, or betray in those parts:
I haue thought good, as well for the keeping
within the Land of the Treasure before spoken
of, then carried into the Indies, and now into
<pb facs="tcp:11660:3"/>
Spaine, as for other respects hereafter remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred;
to instruct those of our Nation how to
sow, plant and perfect this drugge.</p>
            <p>For besides the ill exchange made for this
fantasticall merchandize, and besides, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
rate, and price of the Indian Tobacco;
of which the greatest part is sold for ten times
the value of pepper, and the best of it, weight
for weight, for the finest siluer; it is hard to find
one pound weight in fiue hundred, that is not
sophisticate. The blacke colour which it hath,
and for which our Shoppe-keepers praise it, is
Artificiall: yea all the Tobacco (the leaues of
Hispaniola excepted, which wee call Saint <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo</hi>
Tobacco) is noynted and slubbered ouer
with a kinde of iuyce, or syrope, made of Salt-water,
of the dregges or filth of Sugar, called
<hi>Malasses,</hi> or blacke honey, Guiana pepper, and
leeze of Wine; to which in some places they
adde a red berry called <hi>Anotto,</hi> and other taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Berries, with which the Indians paint their
bodies, and their beds. This they doe to giue
it colour and glosse, to make it the more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantable,
and to giue one and the same coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to all their rotten, withered, &amp; ground-leaues,
which they wrappe vp in the midle of
their wreathes, couering them ouer on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
with one that is good.</p>
            <p>Of this Tobacco, painted with vnwholsome
Berries, there hath beene great store brought
into England of late, in which the rednesse and
<pb facs="tcp:11660:4"/>
Art was manifest: so hath there beene vented a
kinde of filthy leafe, sold by the Portugalles resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in London, the same beeing made vp in
rolles of pounds and halfe pounds.</p>
            <p>By these Aditaments is the nature and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Tobacco changed, and the Hearbe
made vnhealthfull, and extreame dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:
for it is well knowne, that how wholsome
and medicinable soeuer hunnie it selfe may bee,
yet the water of hunnie is starke poyson; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Indian Pepper, scumme of Sugar, or
the dregges or leeze of Wine, and the rest, may
be wholesome enough some way vsed: yet to
take them into the head in fume, cannot but
bee greatly offensiue and preiudiciall. But this
is not the worst: for since the Spaniards haue
obserued, that the <hi>English</hi> respect but two things
chiefly in Tobacco, to wit, the colour, and the
biting in the nose, they haue added poyson to
the painting, and annoynted the leaues of their
Tobacco with common sublimate; by which,
though it doe not worke at the instant; yet may
the one halfe of all the Gentlemen of England,
and many thousands of others be easily poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in one yeare.</p>
            <p>For it is knowne to many that there hath been
Tobacco brought out of Spaine, with dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
sublimate, which euery man knowes to bee
poyson, and no way so dangerously ministred
without suspition, as by fume.</p>
            <p>The naturall colour of Tobacco is a deepe
<pb facs="tcp:11660:4"/>
yellow, or a light tawnie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when the Indians
themselues sold it vs for Kniues, Hatchets,
Beads, Belles, and like merchandise, it had no
other complexion, as all the Tobacco at this
day hath, which is brought from the coast of
Guiana, from Saint <hi>Vincents,</hi> from Saint <hi>Lucia,</hi>
from <hi>Dominica,</hi> and other places, where we buy
it but of the naturall people; and all these sorts
are cleane, and so is that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Domingo,</hi> where
the Spaniards haue not yet learned the Art of
Sophistication.</p>
            <p>There is also a sort of Caraccas Tobacco,
which the Indians make vp, and sell to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,
which is wholesome enough; but there
comes little of it into England</p>
            <p>Now besides these harmefull mixtures, if our
English which delight in Indian Tobacco, had
seene how the Spanish slaues make it vp, how
they dresse their sores, and pockie vlcers, with
the same vnwasht hands with which they slub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and annoynt the Tobacco, and call it sauce
<hi>Per los perros Luteranos,</hi> for <hi>Lutheran</hi> dogges;
they would not so often draw it into their heads
and through their noses as they doe: yea many
a filthy sauour should they find therein, did not
the smell of the hunny maister it; which smell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man may plainly perceiue that takes of the
blacke role Tabacco, brought from <hi>Orenoque,
Trinidado,</hi> and else-where.</p>
            <p>To the end therefore, as I haue already said,
<pb facs="tcp:11660:5"/>
that the treasures exchanged for Tobacco, may
be kept within the Land; that those that delight
therin may haue it at a better rate, and to auoyd
the danger of the Spanish mixtures, I haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>under
set downe certaine obseruations, by the
helpe of which all that are disposed to plant To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco
in England, may assuredly bring the same
to strength and perfection: yea to strength ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
all that is brought from the Indies.</p>
            <p>Now the first thing that you are to take care
for, must be the soyle: of which the ground na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
fertile, is the best, and that which hath
not borne any other but grasse: for if you sow
your seede in ground enriched with dung, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you stay two yeare at least, til the dung and
the vapour therof be consumed, your Tobacco
will retaine the sauour of it.</p>
            <p>If you sow it where Cabbage and Turnips
haue beene lately sowne; those rootes will also
infect your Tobacco with their smell. Nay you
must take care that your ground be not ouer-far:
for the fattest grounds bring forth so thicke and
so rugged a leafe, and so fild with moysture, as it
will neuer be brought to any colour, neuer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
strength, nor neuer burne well in the pipe:
A good soyle, neither too rich nor too poore, is
the best, and the best helpe to better the barren,
is dung of sheepe.</p>
            <p>The seedes which you are to sowe, are of two
kindes, the male and female; the male is the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
<pb facs="tcp:11660:5"/>
leafe, and beares a yellow flower; of which
kinde is that of Brasill, which the people of the
land call <hi>Petun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The female brings a very large leafe, and farre
larger and longer in England, and in France,
then in the Indies; by reason of their sandy
grounds, and want of raine there; and it beares a
pale incarnate flower. If this latter kinde would
ripen in England, in certainty it would yeeld
farre more profite to the planters, it requireth
lesse labour in the gathering, withering, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vp: and being ripe, it will come to a perfect
tawny colour, without any other Art then the
stouing: but the lesser leafe is generally the
stronger, and subiect to lesse hazard then the
greater.</p>
            <p>In all the months betweene September and
Aprill you may cast your seed into the ground:
for as that seed which falleth of it selfe in the end
of September, and lyeth as it falleth vncoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
doth grow and thriue as well as that which
is sowne in Ianuary, February, or March: so
doth the last sowing in Aprill prosper as well,
and grow as soone ripe as any of the rest. When
it is sowne it must bee couered but thinly with
earth: for if you rake too much earth ouer it,
it will come vp too late to ripen for that
yeare.</p>
            <p>If the Spring bee dry, you must water it often
to bring it out of the ground: your water must
be riuer or pond water; for that of welles is too
<pb facs="tcp:11660:6"/>
cold, except you set it all the day in the
Sunne.</p>
            <p>After your seedes are growne vp to a stalke of
three inches high, you must take them vp and
replant them, leauing two foot betweene each
plant of the lesser kinde, and three foo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
each plant of the greater. If you leaue
your plants so long on the ground ere you set
them abroad, that the stalke haue sixe inches in
length, then must you either bury in the ground
foure of the sixe inches, or else they will hang
the head, and be long ere they recouer: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
set them in so deepe you bury that part of
the stalke which would bring out your fairest
and strongest leaues: you must therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
as soone as you haue a stalke able to be set
abrode.</p>
            <p>You must also take care to water your plants
once a day: in the morning, if the Spring bee
cold; in the euening if it bee warme; otherwise
they will wither, or stand long ere they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
            <p>After they are growne a foote high, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more, they will offer to knob, and cast out
little buttons for seede; which they will doe the
sooner if you sowe them in the increase of the
Moone, which you must auoyd. These knobbes
you must euery day nippe off, so must you doe
all the by-branches that it casteth out, and all the
stalkes but one that shoots out of the same root:
you must leaue but one stalke, and vpon it not
<pb facs="tcp:11660:6"/>
aboue 8 or 10 leaues. This pruning must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
from the time that your Tobacco be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to yeeld shuttes and buttons for seed, euen
to the time that you gather it: which if you shall
neglect, coueting to haue many stalkes, because
many leaues, your Tobacco will be weake and
worth nothing.</p>
            <p>Your next and greatest care must bee, your
patience to attend the ripening: for if you ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your leaues before they change colour on
the stalke, they will be good for nothing. Your
corne and all other fruits and graines may teach
you this, that nothing hath any great vertue
where nature is preuented. When your leaues
be toward ripening, they will bee full of yellow
spottes, which you shal best discerne if you hold
a leafe betweene you and the light.</p>
            <p>And yet you must not so loue your owne as
to take it greene: for if when you cut it and dry
it, how strong soeuer it proue in the taking of it,
the greatnesse shewes that either it wants ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or fermentation; it must looke yellow at
the least, otherwise it may proue equally harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
with that which is sophisticate. I must also
aduise you, not to slubber your English with
<hi>Mel rosarum,</hi> and other trumpery, as many of
our owne Artificers do, therby to bring it to the
Indian colour: it is an impious practise to play
with the health of men, and to make profite by
their destruction. Your English Tobacco if you
<pb facs="tcp:11660:7"/>
giue it time to ripen, and time to ferment, will
change colour, and cast off all her naughty and
vnwholsome moysture, and change her greene
garment for that which is perfect yellow or
tawny, without any art or addition.</p>
            <p>When you haue gathered the ripe leaues; for
all will not be ripe at once, you may lay them in
the Sunne for two or three houres, otherwise
they will be so brickle, as they will breake in the
stringing: and if the weather bee cloudy, then
you may leaue them in your baskets two or
three dayes, and then string them vpon threed,
and so hang them in a close roome, where no
winde entreth, or lay them on a cleane boorded
floore, till they wither and become yellowish,
which they will do in 10, 12, or 14 dayes, but
you may not ouer-dry them; for then they will
not sweat and change colour.</p>
            <p>When they are thus withered, but not dried
to crumble, you must stoue them in heapes, in
a heat somewhat stronger then a hot-house, and
like vnto the heate of an Ouen after the bread
drawne: for if your heate bee too great, it will
burne, if too little, it will require a long time in
their sweating, or fermentation, ere they bee
brought to perfection. But if you suffer your
leaues to be perfect ripe ere you gather them,
then they will ferment in a short time, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a perfect Indian colour, I meane the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Indian colour, though not the artificiall and
<pb facs="tcp:11660:7"/>
blacke. He that weares cloath to the end it was
inuented for, to wit, to defend him from cold,
and wet, cares more for the goodnesse then the
colour: howsoeuer it is better to accept of our
owne with some little fault, then to vse the India
with a great deale of filthinesse.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, and vntill we haue store of
our owne, I aduise my Countrey-men to take
the leafe of Saint <hi>Domingo,</hi> or the leaues of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minica,</hi>
and of the Ilands adioyning, or those
Indian leaues that are of a deep yellow, or slight
tawny, which colours are naturall, and forbeare
the blacke which is foule, the dyed Tobacco,
which is red, and the leafe brought in by the
Portugalles, and the like slubbered stuffe.</p>
            <p>The Tobacco which comes from the Barmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da
is cast away either by neglecting to prune it,
or else because they nourish ouer-many leaues
on one stalke, which they do either out of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or for that they couer to haue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quantity, or otherwise; because, as I heare,
they imitate the Spaniards in iuicing it: that
place would otherwise giue vs that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
and so would Virginia.</p>
            <p>For the rest, after you haue taken your Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co
out of your stoue, you must layit abrode some
three or foure dayes: for if you make it vp too
moist, it will grow mouldy.</p>
            <p>For conclusion, because there hath beene
much dispute about this hearbe, whether it bee
<pb facs="tcp:11660:8"/>
wholsome or harmfull: I will let my Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
know, what by long experience, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with others, I finde.</p>
            <p>It is taken in all America, euen from Canada
to the straights of Magellan, in all Affrica vpon
the coast, from Barbary to the Cape of good
hope, and so till you come to the mouth of the
red sea; it is also vsed in most of all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the East Indies.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards and Indians of the West giue
vs three principall reasons why they vse it: the
first is because it opens the body, and lets out the
heate by the pores which is <hi>praeter naturam</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them: the second is, the consumption and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding
of superfluous moysture wherewith
they are filled by eating of fruits abundantly, by
drinking of water, and in all the In-land Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
for want of salt: the third is, because it
staies both hunger and thirst, and doth refresh
them after great trauaile and toyle: these be the
general vertues and knowne to all: but the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Physitians, their Priests, and others that are
learned, finde somewhat else, and of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
in this hearbe: for they vse a confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Tobacco in all Callentures or burning
feuers, and they take it in smoke to defend them
in long nauigations from the scuruy, and they
cure with it all sores and vlcers: yea it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that the iuice of Tobacco, mixt with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
sea-water, doth resist the venome of poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:11660:8"/>
arrowes, wherewith the Spaniards (how
slight soeuer the hurt bee) are without such a
help wounded to death. The Brasilians say that
it is cordiall, and they also take it to stay hunger
and thirst when they trauel and want sustenance.
The people of the South-parts of Virginia e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
it exceedingly, and so doe the rest: they
say that God in the creation did first make a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
then a man, thirdly great maize, or Indian
wheat, and fourthly, Tobacco: they vse it for the
curing of wounds, and in smoke as we doe; and
they are superstitiously led to beleeue that when
they are in danger of drowning, in foule wether,
that if they cast Tobacco into the water, that the
billow will fall,<note place="margin">L. 1. Simplicium medicament. ex nouo orbe dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum.</note> and grow lesse. <hi>Monardus</hi> the
Spaniard commends it in all pains of the head,
growing by defluctions or windy vapors, in the
tooth-ake occasioned by cold rume, in all disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the breast, old coughes, asmaticall passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the like, in all paines of the ioynts, and
swellings, if the leaues roasted vnder imbers be
often applied; which the Indian women admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to their children for the coldnesse of
their stomacke, and windinesse. The same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
affirmeth, that in the suffocation of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,
it is a present remedie, if the leaues made
warme be applied to the nauell or bottome of
the belly; in all greene woundes and vlcers, and
in the gangrene he prizeth it aboue all other ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables:
yea hee affirmeth that an experience
was made in the presence of <hi>King Philip</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb facs="tcp:11660:9"/>
of Spaine, vpon a dogge poysoned. These
be <hi>Monardus</hi> his words, as I finde them in <hi>Clusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,

willing to make triall of the vertue of it, caused
a dogge to haue a wound made in his throat,
and to be anointed with poyson which the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
vse; and a while after he made the iuyce of
Tobacco to bee plentifully powred into it, and
the brused leaues to be bound vpon the wound,
and the dogge was healed, to the no smal admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of all that were present. The same Author
commends this hearbe for the cure of the <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:11660:9"/>
the vse of this hearbe, I thought good to
take it out word for word, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good of all poore people needing such a
remedy, and these be his words. I do make here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
an excellent balsame to cure deepe wounds
and punctures, &amp;c. which balsame doth bring vp
the flesh from the bottome very speedily, &amp; also
heale simple cuts in the flesh, according to the
first intention, that is, to glew or soder the lips of
the wound together, not procuring matter or
corruption vnto it, as is commonly seene in the
healing of wounds. Take (saith he) oyle of roses,
oyle of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> wort, of either one pint, the
leaues of Tobacco, stamped smal in a stone mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
two pound, boyle them together to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of the iuice, straine it, and put it to the
fire againe, adding thereunto of Venice Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
two ounces, of Olibanum and Mastic, of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
halfe an ounce in most fine and subtill pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which may at all times make it into an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent
or salue, by putting therunto wax and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin,
to giue vnto it a stiffe body. He further saith,
that the iuice or distilled water of the lesser leafe
is very good against catharres, the dizinesse of
the head, and rhumes that fall down to the eyes,
against the paine called the Migrame,
if either you apply it to the temples, or
take one or two greene leaues, or the drye leafe
moystened in wine, and warmed on Imbers,
and apply it. Many notable medicines are made
hereof against the old and inueterate cough, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against
<pb facs="tcp:11660:10"/>
asthmatical and pectorall griefes, which
if I should set downe at large, would require a
peculiar volume. So farre <hi>Gerald.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the taking of it in smoke, if the Tobacco
be cleane, and not poysoned with iuices, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Art, I know that it is an excellent remedy
for the head-ake, for the <hi>vertigo</hi> &amp; dizines of the
head, for moist &amp; watery stomakes, it preuaileth
against the rumes &amp; defluctions, &amp; all the pains
of the ioynts therby occasioned, and against all
affections of the head, watering of the eyes, and
tooth-ake, that it keepes off the gout and sciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
and taketh away the rednesse of the face, that
at sea it preserueth those that take it both from
the Calenture or burning Feuer, and from the
Scuruie, that it openeth obstructions, and is
exceeding profitable in the falling sickenesse.
The syrope is a good vomite, and so is a draught
of white or renish wine, wherein so much of the
leafe as weigheth sixe pence hath beene stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
all night: the oyle that droppeth out of a
foule pipe, killeth Tetters, and all of that kinde.</p>
            <p>The Hearbalists and other Physitians make
diuers kindes or <hi>species</hi> of this Tobacco; they
commend that which beareth the great leafe,
and pale incarnate flower, and call it the true
Tobacco, a second sort they call <hi>Petum,</hi> and a
third <hi>Nicosian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others (and thinke they speake learnedly) call
our English of the lesser leafe, yellow Henbane,
or <hi>Hoscyamus Luteus,</hi> and the greater <hi>Hoscya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
<pb facs="tcp:11660:10"/>
Peruuianus;</hi> yea they make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Tobacco of <hi>Paria</hi> and <hi>Trinidado,</hi> and
that of <hi>Peru;</hi> although I am well assured, that
there was neuer any one pound of <hi>Peru</hi> Tobacco
seene in England or in Europe. But if the hearb
which we call Sage, differ in kind from the same
hearbe, because the French cal it <hi>Searge,</hi> and the
Latines <hi>Saluia,</hi> and so all other hearbs, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
nations call diuersly: then doth the <hi>Petum,</hi>
the <hi>Nicosian,</hi> and the <hi>Tobacco</hi> differ; otherwise
there is nothing between them: But the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
&amp; littlenesse which we distinguish by male
and female, as in many other hearbs we doe the
like: for the Spaniards which first found
this plant in the Isle <hi>Tobaque,</hi> did therfore call it
after the name of that Island: and it is true, that
because there is no better soile in the world, and
that it hath raine &amp; heat sufficient, the Tobacco
there growing is very large. Of this very kinde
(found euery where in <hi>America</hi>) it was that <hi>Iohn
Nicot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Clusius &amp; Seres Theuet. Cos. gen.</note> born in <hi>Nismes</hi> in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> &amp; Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
in Portugall for <hi>Henry</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of France, sent
of the seed to Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> after
called, <hi>Queene Mother of France,</hi> wherevpon it
was by some called, <hi>Queen Mothers hearbe,</hi> by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
it was and is still called <hi>Nycosian,</hi> and yet
<hi>Theuet</hi> vaunts that he sent it into France 10 years
before <hi>Nicots</hi> Embassage. Now as the <hi>Brasilians</hi>
call this <hi>Tobacco, Petum;</hi> so in the <hi>West Indies</hi> it is
cald <hi>Vicielt,</hi> saith <hi>Monardus:</hi> and <hi>Ouiedus. lib. 11

               <note place="margin">Simp. Medicam.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:11660:11"/>
the Guianians call it <hi>Tamoi,</hi> other Nations <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel,</hi>
&amp; the Virginians <hi>Opoak,</hi> &amp; it is euery where,
and in England it selfe, greater, according to the
soyle: yea it diffe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s in taste, thickenesse, large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and goodnesse almost in euery Garden
wherein it is planted.</p>
            <p>True it is, notwithstanding that there are found
manifest differences in the male and female, or
in the greater or the lesse, both in flower &amp; large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
though both of one kinde, the same being
found in many Hearbes, Plants, and Trees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
            <p>Now for those that make Tobacco a kinde of
<hi>Hoscryamus,</hi> because it stupifieth as <hi>Hoscryamus,</hi>
or Henbane doth, they may as wel say that <hi>Opiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>
is also a kinde of Tobacco, or Tobacco a kinde
of <hi>Opium,</hi> or that <hi>Stramonium</hi> is of that <hi>species</hi>
which benummeth more then either Tobacco
or <hi>Opium.</hi> For the rest, this is true, that as it is
vsually taken in England, it hath more of the ill
then of the good. For those that take Tobacco
with wine, do absolutely alter the propertie of
it, &amp; make it the Artificer of many ill accidents
and diseases, I meane all those that drinke wine
betweene meales, and presently after the taking
of it. For where God hath giuen this hearbe for
a remedy to those poore people that want both
wine, spice, and salt, that doe often swim riuers,
and diue vnder water, that goe naked, and are
beaten with showres, that feed aboundantly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
fruits, that suffer hunger and thirst, that liue
<pb facs="tcp:11660:11"/>
in a region violently hot: we in this part of the
world vse Wine of all sorts, and all sorts of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
we eate salt with our meat, and powder our
flesh and fish with it, and thereby drye vp, and
sucke out the corrupt and harmefull moysture
that it hath: we that, besides Wine, haue strong
Beere, &amp; strong Ale, that couer our bodies with
garments, and are prest with cold for three parts
of the yeare, do not need any such drying fume
at all.</p>
            <p>It is true that those that haue decaying bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
those that are of yeares, and opprest with
moysture and fleame, those that are subiect
to rhumes and the cough, that haue cold sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes,
and are inclined to the gout, or haue it,
or that are subiect to any of the imperfections
before named, for those it is a singular remedy.
But it destroies all our youth that take it without
cause, and euery houre of the day, it makes them
tender and not able to endure the aire, it makes
them dull and sleepy, brings them to the rhume
and tooth-ake, marres their teeth, except they
cleanse them often, begets in them a drouth,
and consequently a desire to drinke: yea and an
entrance to drunkennesse it selfe: for many of
them finding some little sickenesse in their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes
when they take strong Tobacco, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
drinke of the strongest Wines: the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco
opens the body, and makes way, by which
the wine inuadeth the liuer, and drieth it vp: yea
taken in that manner with strong drinkes it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
<pb facs="tcp:11660:12"/>
the radicall moysture, and hastneth on
old age: the Indians doe therefore forbid it
the children, till they haue taken wiues and haue
had children, as wee in England were wont to
forbid maides and yong men the vse of Wine:
for though Tobacco stirre the appetite, yet is it
no friend to generation, vsed with wine as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remembred. He that desireth further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
