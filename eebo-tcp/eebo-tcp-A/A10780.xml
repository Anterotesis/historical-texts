            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMongest manye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worthy &amp; sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie Histories, and notable acts which we haue in hande, and ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de (by the grace of Christe oure Lorde) shortly to set abrode, of such as of late daies haue ben persecuted, murthered, &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred for the trewe Gospell of Christ, in Quene Maries rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne. Firste to begin with this litell treatis of Doct. Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Ridley, late Byshoppe of London, this shalbe to desyre thee (gentle Reader) to accept it, and studiouslye to peruse it
<pb facs="tcp:16419:3"/>
in the meane tyme, whyle the other Uolumes be addressing, which we ar about, touching the full Historie, processe, and examinations, of all our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed brethren, lately persecuted for rightuosnes sake. Whiche Histories wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they shal come to light, (I suppose) thou shalt see as horrible a slaughter of the Sainctes, ioyned with as much crueltie of some English hertes, as euer in anye one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme before Christe, or after was sene. In the meane time because all thynge can not be done at once, &amp; the Uolumes be long, accept well in worth this litle, (but pithie) worke of
<pb facs="tcp:16419:3"/>
this forsaid Bishoppe, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of greater thynges, which shall (perchaunce) more largely satisfie thy desyre. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the contentes of this Booke, the Argument doeth easely import. For the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therof, the name onely of the Author is a sufficient com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendation, though I bestow no prayse therof. Firste whan thou readist it by the name of a Fare well, thou maiest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande a faithfull Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as of one, beynge in that case, nothing dissembling his conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in suche matters and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies of religion, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he suffered.</p>

            <p>Thus doble waies are we bounde to the Lorde, who not onely by the bloud and death of his Sainctes, confirmeth the testimonie of his trueth, but also besydes theyr death, leaueth such monumentes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them, which no lesse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <pb facs="tcp:16419:4"/>Briefly, as there is nothing in this Boke that greatly nea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth any mans commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beyng able ynough of his owne praise: so neyther do I so mistrust thy vertuous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes (good and Christian Reader) in godly studie &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that thou shouldst great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nead my exhortation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, or any Epistle before the worke: saue only that I wold desyre the aide of thy Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prayer, whereby the thinges maye the more luckely come forward, whiche for thy sake at this present we do acheue, to the fortheryng of God hys glory, the testimony of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

and establishing of thy conscience. Thus desyring the brotherly helpe of thy prayer I wishe thee to fare wel with well fare in the Lorde. The grace of Christe confyrme vs, and stablyshe vs in all wel doing, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his name.</p>

Honor thy mother inlawe his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and loue all that perteyneth vnto him: beyng readie to do them good as it shal lie in thy power. As for thy children I doubt not of thy

sake suffred in christes name, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by the mouth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Apostle, blessed and happye, how much more happy and blessed is he that hathe the grace to suffer death also. Wherfore al you that be my true louers and fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, reioyse, and reioyse with me againe. And render with me harty thanckes to God oure heauenly father, that for his Sonnes sake, my Sauioure &amp; redeamer Christ, he hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saued to call me, beinge els with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his gratious goodnesse, in my selfe but a sinfull and a vile wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che: to cal me I say, vnto this high dignitie of his true Prophets, and of his faithfull Apostles: and of his holye elected and chosen Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, that is to die and to spende this Temporall life in the defence and maintenaunce of his eternall and euerlastinge truthe. Ye knowe
<pb facs="tcp:16419:11"/>
that be my Countrye men, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge vppon the Borders, where (alas) the true man suffereth oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times muche wronge at the theues hande: if it chaunce a manne to be slaine of the theefe (as it oft chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth there) whiche wente oute with his neighboure to healpe hym, to rescue his goodes againe, that the more cruellye he be slaine: and the more stedfaste hee stooke by hys neighboure in fighte agaynste the face of the theefe, the more fauour and frendship shall all his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie haue for the slaine mans sake of all them that bee true: as longe as the memorye of hys facte, and hys Posteritye dothe endure.</p>
            <p>Euen so ye that be my Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke and Countrye men, knowe ye, howe so euer the blinde, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunte and wicked worlde hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shall raile vppon my Deathe,
<pb facs="tcp:16419:12"/>
which thing they can not do worse then their fathers did of the death of Christ our sauioure of his holye Prophets, Apostles, and martirs. Know ye (I say) that bothe before God, and al them that be godlye, and that truelye knoweth, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the lawes of God, ye haue and shall haue by Gods grace e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer cause to reioyse, and to thanck God highly, and to thinke good of it: and in god, to reioyse of me your fleshe and blud, whome God of his gracious goodnes hath voutchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to associate vnto the blessed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his holy martirs in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; I doubt not in the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my Lorde God, nor in the faithfull fellowship of his electe &amp; chosen people: but at bothe thier handes in my cause, ye shall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finde the more fauor &amp; grace. For the Lord saith that he will be

both to them and theirs that loueth him, the more louinge againe in a thousand generacions. The Lord is so full of mercy to them I saye: &amp; theirs which do loue him in dede. And Christe saithe againe that no man can shewe more loue then to geue his life for his frende. Nowe also know ye all my true louers in God, my kinsefolke and Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the cause wherfore I am put to death, is euen after the same sorte and condicion, but touchinge more nie Gods cause, and in more weighty matters: but in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kinde al one, for both is Gods cause, bothe is in the maintenance of righte, bothe is for the commen wealth, and both for the weale also of the Christian brother: although yet there is in these two no small difference, both concerning the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, the goodes stollen, and the
<pb facs="tcp:16419:13"/>
maner of the fight. For know ye al, as there: when the pore true ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is robbed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thefe of his own goods truely gotten, wherupon he &amp; hys houshold shuld liue, is greatli wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thys Churche of Englande had of late of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb facs="tcp:16419:13"/>
goodnesse and aboundaunte grace of almightye God, greate substaunce, greate ryches, of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye treasure: greate plentye of Goddes true and sincere woorde, the true and wholesome admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracion of Christes holye Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes, the hole profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes religion truelye and plainlye sette forth in Baptisme, the plaine declaration and vnderstandynge of the same taught in the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thechisme to haue ben learned of al true Christians. This church had also a true and sincere forme and manner of the Lordes Supper, wherin according to Christes own ordinaunce and holy institucion: Christes commaundements were executed &amp; done. For vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bread and wine set vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lordes table, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes wer geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lordes deathe was had,
<pb facs="tcp:16419:14"/>
the bread in the remembraunce of Christes body torn vpon the crosse, was broken, and the Cuppe in the remembraunce of Christes bloude shed, was distributed, and bothe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minicated vnto al that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and woulde receiue them: and thereunto were also exhorted of the minister to do. All was done open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the mother tonge, so that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing might be both easely hard and plainlye vnderstand of all the people to Goddes high glory, and the edification of the hole Church. This Churche had of late the hole diuine Seruice, all commen and publique Prayers ordeined to be saide and hard in the commen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: not only framed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned to the true vaine of holye scripture: but also all thinges so set forthe according to the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente of the Lorde and Sainte

Paules doctrine for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peoples edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also in their vulgare tonge, it had also holye and holsome Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall vertues, which are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in scripture, and likewise other Homelies against the moste perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and capitall vices that vseth (alas) to reigne in this Realme of Englande. This Churche had in matters of controuersy, articles so penned and framed after the holye Scripture, and grounded vpon the true vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of Gods word, that in shorte time if they had bene vniuersallye receiued they shoulde haue bene able to haue set in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes church, much concord and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in Christes true Religion, and to haue expelled many false errors &amp; heresies, wherwith this churche (alas) was almost nigh ouergone. But, alas, of late into this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

possession of this heauenlye treasoure of these godly ritches, are entred in theues, that haue robbed and spoyled all this heauenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soure away. I may wel complaine on them and crye oute vpon theese Theues with the Prophet, saying <hi>Deus venerunt gentes in heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem tuam. &amp;c. Psal. 79.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Lord God the gentiles, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then nations are come into thy he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, they haue defiled thy holye Temple, and made Ierusalem an heape of stones, that is, they haue broken and beate downe to the grounde thy holye Citie: This E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenishe generacion, these Theues of Samaria, these Sabei and Caldei, these robbers haue rushed oute of their dennes, and hath rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Churche of Englande of all the foresaide holye Treasoure of God, they haue carried awaye
<pb facs="tcp:16419:15"/>
and ouerthrowne it, and in steade of Goddes holye woorde, the true and right administracion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes holy Sacraments, as of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and others, they mixte theyr ministery with mennes folish fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies, and manye wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly tradicions withall.</p>
            <p>In the steade of the Lordes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly table, they geue the people with muche solemne disgisinge a thinge they call it their masse, but in dead and in truthe it is a very maskinge and a mockery of the true Supper of the Lord or rather I may call it a craftye Iuglinge, whereby these false theues &amp; Iuglers hath bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mindes of the simple people y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei haue brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true worship of god vnto pernicious I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, &amp; make them to beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to be Christ our Lord &amp; sauior, which in deede, is neither God nor man,
<pb facs="tcp:16419:16"/>
nor hathe anye life in it selfe, but in substance is the creature of breade and wine, and in vse of the Lordes table is the Sacramente of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body and bloude. And for thys holy vse which the Lorde hathe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined them in his Table, to repre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent vnto vs his blessed body torne vpon the crosse for vs, &amp; his bloud there shed, it pleased him to cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his body and bloud, whiche vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge, Christe declareth to be his true meaning, when he saithe: do this in the remembrance of me. And againe Saint Paule doth set out the same more plainly, speking of the same Sacramente after the wordes of the consecration, &amp; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As often as ye shall eat of this breade and drincke of this Cuppe: ye shall set forthe (he meaneth with the same) the Lords death vntil his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming again: And here also these
<pb facs="tcp:16419:16"/>
theues haue robbed againe the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of the Lordes Cuppe, contrary to the plain words of Christ, writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his Gospel. Now for the comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> publike prayers which were in the vulgare tongue: these theues haue brought againe a straunge tonge, whereof the people vnderstand not one word: wherin what do they els but robbe the people of their diuine seruice, wherin they ought to pray together with the Priest. And to pray in a strange tonge, what is it but as sainte Paule calleth it bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barousnes, childishnes, vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble folly: yea and plaine madnesse. For the godlye articles of vnitie in Religion, and for the holsome Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies, what do these theues place in the stead of them, but the Popes lawes &amp; decrees, lying Legandes: and fained fables and miracles to delude and abuse the simplicitye of
<pb facs="tcp:16419:17"/>
the rude people. Thus this robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye and thefte is not only commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (nay sacrilege and wicked spoil of heauenly thinges) but also in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stead of the same is brought in and placed the abhominable desolacion of the tirant Antiochus, of proude Senacherib, of the shameles faced king, and of the Babilonical beast. Unto this robbery, this thefte and sacrilege because I can not conse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nor God willing, neuer shal, so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as the breth is in my body, because it is blasphemy against God, high treason vnto Christ our heauenlye King, Lord, Master, and our only sauioure and redeamer: it is plaine contrary to Gods word, &amp; to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes Gospel, it is the subuersion of all true godlines, and againste the euerlasting saluacion of mine own soule, and all my brethren &amp; sisters whome Christe my sauioure hathe
<pb facs="tcp:16419:17"/>
so derely bought with no lesse price then with the effusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and shedding forth of his most precious bloude. Therefore all ye my true louers in God, my Kinsfolk and countryme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for this cause knowe ye that I am put to death, which by Gods grace I shal willingly take with harty tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes to God therfore: in certain hope w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any doubting to receiue at Goddes hande againe of his fre mercye and grace, euerlasting life.</p>
            <p>Althoughe the cause of the true man slaine of the thefe, healpinge hys neyghboure to recouer hys goodes again, and the cause wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am to be put to death in a ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neralitie, is both one, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet knowe ye that there is no small difference. These theues as against whome I stand, are much worse then the robbers and theues of the borders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16419:18"/>The goodes which they steale are much more precious, &amp; their kinde of fighte are farre diuers. These theues are worse I saye: for they are more cruell, more wicked, more false, deceitful &amp; more craftye. For those will kill but the body. These will not sticke to kil both body and soule. Those for the generall theft &amp; robbery be called (&amp; are in dede) theues and robbers. But these for their spirituall kind of robbery are called <hi>Sacrilegi,</hi> as ye would saye, Churche robbers. They are more wicked. For those goeth about but to spoile men of worldlye thinges, worldly riches, gold and siluer, and worldly substance. These go about in the wais of the deuil (ther gost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father) to stele from the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sall churche, and perticulerly from euery man, all heauenlye treasure, true Faith, true Charity, and hope
<pb facs="tcp:16419:18"/>
of saluacion in the bloud of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioure Iesus Christe: yea to spoile vs of oure Sauiour Christ, of his Gospell, of his heauenlye spirite: and of the heauenly heritage of the kingdom of heauen, so derely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased vnto vs with the deathe of our Maister and sauioure Christ. These be the goodes and godlye substaunce wherupon the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an before God must liue. And with out the which he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not liue. These goodes, these theues, these churche robbers, go aboute to spoile vs of. The whiche goodes as to the man of God they excel, and farre passeth all worldlye treasure: so to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande euen vnto the deathe suche theues as go about to spoile bothe vs and the hole Churche of suche goodes, is most highe and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble seruice done vnto God.</p>
            <p>These Churche robbers be also
<pb facs="tcp:16419:19"/>
muche more false, craftye, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull then the theues vppon the borders. For these haue not the crafte so to commende their thefte, that they dare avouch it. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as acknowledging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues to be euill, they steale commenlye vpon the nighte, they dare not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere at iudgementes and sessions, wher iustice is executed. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are taken and broughte thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: they neuer hange no man, but they be ofte times hanged for their faultes.</p>
            <p>But these Churche robbers can so cloke and coloure their spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all robbery, that they can make the people to beleue falshed to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, and truthe falshed, good to be euell, and euell good, lyghte to be darkenesse, and darkenesse lyghte, Superstition to be true Religion, and Idolatrye to be the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb facs="tcp:16419:19"/>
of God: and that whiche is in substaunce the creature of breade and wine, to be none other substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce but onlye the substance of Christe the liuinge Lorde bothe God and manne. And this there falshed and craft they canne so Iuggle and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witche the vnderstandynge of the simple, that they dare avouch it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlye in Courte and in town, and feareth neither hanginge nor hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge as the poore Theues of the borders do. But stoute and strong like Nembrothe, dare condempne to be burned in flaming fire quicke &amp; aliue, who so euer will go aboute to bewray their falshed.</p>
            <p>The kinde of fighte agaynste these Churche robbers, is also of an other sorte and kinde: then is that whiche is againste the theues of the borders.</p>
            <p>For there the true menne goe

forth againste the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with speare and launce, with bowe and byll, and al suche kinde of bodely weapons, as the trew men hath.</p>
            <p>But here as the enemies be of another nature: so the watchmen of Christes flocke, the warriours that fyght in the Lords war, must be armed, and fight with another kinde of weapons and Armour, For here the enemies of God, the souldiors of Antichrist althoughe the battell is set forth agaynst the Churche by mortall men, beynge fleshe and bloud, and neuertheles members of their father the deuil: yet for that theyr graunde maister is the power of darkenesse, theyr me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers are spirituall wickednes, wicked spirits, spirits of errours, of heresies, of all deceate, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines, spirits of idolatrie, super<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Hipocresie, which ar called

And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as S.

            <p>Oure weapons therefore are faith

With these weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnder the banner of the Crosse of Christe we do fighte: euer hauinge an eie vpon our graund Master, Duke, and capitaine Christ.

And the more

cruell, the more painefull the more vile and spitefull is the kind of the death, wherunto we be put y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more glorious in God, the more blessed and happy we recken withoute all doubtes our martirdome to be.</p>

            <p>Farewell Rochester, sometime my Cathedrall sea. In whome to say the truth I did finde much ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And I beseke God if it be his plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure, that that whiche is but my personall wronge be not laid to thi charge on the latter day. But this can I praye for thee.

Among the worshipfull of the City, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally which were in office of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, ye and in other Citezens also whome to name now it shal not be necessary. In the time of my mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterye, whiche was from the latter part of sir Rowland Hilles yeare, vnto sir George Barnes yere, and a great part therof, I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I found no smal huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlenes, as me thought. But to say the truth that I esteme
<pb facs="tcp:16419:29"/>
before all other for true Christian kindnesse that is shewed in Gods cause, and done for his sake: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore O Dobbes, Dobbes, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Knighte: thou in thy yere diddest win my hart for euermore, for that honorable acte, that moste blessed woorke of God, of the erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and setting vp of Christes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hospitalles and truelye religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houses, which bithe &amp; through the was begonne. For thou lyke a manne of God, when the matter was moued for the relief of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes pore selye members to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from extreame miserye, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and famine, thy harte was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with Pity. And as Christ high honourable officer in that cause, thou calledst together thy Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Aldermen of the Citie, before whome thou brake the matter for the poore, thou pleadest theyr

The Lorde wroughte with thee, and gaue thee the consente of thy brethren.</p>
            <p>Whereby the matter was brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte to the Commen Counsel, and so to the whole bodye of the Citye. by whome with an vniforme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the matter was committed to be drawne, ordered, and deuised by a certaine noumber of the mooste wittye Citizeins, and Politike, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued also w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> godlines, &amp; with ready

And they like true and faithfull Ministers, both to theyr Citie, and to their Master Christe, so ordred, deuised, &amp; brought forthe the matter, that thousandes of sely pore members of Christ, which els for extreame hunger and miserye shoulde haue famished and peari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, shall be relieued and holpen vp, and shall haue cause to blisse the Aldermen, the commen counsel and the hole body of the Citye, but specially thee o Dobbes, and those chosen men by whome this hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable worke of God was bego<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne &amp; wrought: and that so long through out all ages, as that godlye worke shall endure: whiche I praye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God may be euer vnto the worldes end.</p>
            <p>And thou o sir George Barnes,
<pb facs="tcp:16419:30"/>
the truth is to be confessed to Gods glorye, and to the good example of other, thou waste in thy yeare not onlye a furtherer and continuer of that, which before the, by thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor Dobbes was well begon: but also diddest laboure so to haue profited the worke, that it shoulde baue bene an absolute thing a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect spectacle of true charitie &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse vnto all Christendome.</p>
            <p>Thine endeuor was to haue set vp an house of occupations, bothe that all kinde of pouertie, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to worke, shoulde not haue lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wherevppon profitablye they might haue bene occupied to theyr owne reliefe, and to the profit and commoditie of the commen wealth of the Citie, and also to haue rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thither, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pore babes broughte vp in the Hospitals, when they had come to a certain age and stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth.</p>

            <p>Farewell nowe all ye Citezens that be of God, of what state and condition so euer ye be: vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in London ye haue hard Gods

My hartes desire and daily praier shall be for you, as for whom (for my time) I know to my Lord God I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: that ye neuer swarue, neither for losse of life or worldly goodes, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods holy word, and yeld vnto Antichrist, wherupon must nedes follow the great displeaser of God, and the losse of your bodies &amp; souls into perpetuall dampnation for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore.</p>
            <p>Now that I haue gon through the places wher I haue dwelt any space in the time of my pilgrimage here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth. Remembring that for the space of Kinge Edwardes reigne, whiche was for the time of mine Office in the Seas of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Rochester, I was a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the higher house of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamente. Therefore seinge my God hathe geuen mee laysoure,

and the remembraunce thereof. I will bid my Lordes of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie farewel: They shal haue no iust cause by Gods grace to take it that I entend to say in ill part. As for spirituall prelacy, that now is, I haue nothing to say to them: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte I shoulde repeate agayne a greate parte of that I haue saide before now, all readye to the Sea of London.</p>
            <p>But to you my Lordes of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralty, vnderstand ye thys firste. That when I wrote this, I loked daily, when I should be called to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chaunge of my life. And thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that this my writinge shoulde not come to your knowledge before the time of the dissolucion of my bodye and soule shoulde be expired: and therfore know ye that I had before mine eies only the feare of God, &amp; Christian Charitie towarde you,
<pb facs="tcp:16419:32"/>
whiche moued me to write: for of you hereafter I looke not in thys world, other for pleaser or displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, if my talke shal do you neuer so much pleasure or profit, you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not promote me. Nor if I displese you, ye can not hurt me, or harme me: For I shall be oute of your reache. Nowe therefore if you feare God, and can be content to heare the talk of him that seketh nothing at your hands, but to serue God, and to do you good: herke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what I say: I say vnto you as. S. Paul saieth to the Galathians, I wonder mi Lordes what hathe bewitched you, that ye so sode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly are fallen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ vnto Antichrist: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christes gospel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mens tradicions: from the Lord that boughte you, vnto the Bishop now of Rome. I warn you of your pearill, be not deceiued, except you will be found willingly consenters
<pb facs="tcp:16419:33"/>
vnto your owne deathe. For if ye thincke thus, we are lay men, thys is a matter of Religion, we follow as we are taughte and led, if oure teachers and gouernors teach vs, and leade vs amisse, the faulte is in them, they shall beare the blame. My Lords this is true, I graunt you that both the false teacher, and the corrupt gouernoure, bothe shal be punished for the deathe of theyr subiecte, whome they haue falselye taughte and corruptlye ledde: And his bloud shall be required at their handes. But yet neuerthelesse shal that subiecte die the death him self also, that is: he shal also be damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his owne sinne.</p>
            <p>For if the blind leade the blinde, Christe saithe not the leader only, but he saithe, bothe shall fall in the ditche. Shall the Sinagoge and the Senate of the Iewes (trow ye)
<pb facs="tcp:16419:33"/>
whyche forsooke Christe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to his Deathe, therefore be excused, because Annas, Caiphas, with the Scribes and Phariseis, and their cleargy did teach them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse? yea and also Pilate theyr gouernoure, and the Emperoures Lieuetenaunte by his tirranny did withoute cause put him to deathe. Forsothe no my Lordes, no: but notwithstanding that corrupt doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine or Pilates washinge of hys handes, neither of both shal excuse other, that sinagoge and seigniour, or Pilate. But at the Lordes hand for the effusion of that innocentes blud on the latter dai, al shal drink of the deadlye whip. Ye are wittye and vnderstand what I meane. Therefore I will passe ouer thys, and return to tel you howe you are fallen from Christe to his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye the Bishyp of Rome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16419:34"/>And least my Lordes I maye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture thincke me thus barely to call the Bishop of Rome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes aduersarye, or to speake it in plain termes to cal him Antichrist, that it is don in mine anguish, and that I do but rage, and as a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man do not care, what I say, or vpon whome I do raile. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that your Lordships may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue my minde, and vnderstande that I speake the words of truthe and of sobriety, as S. Paule saide vnto <hi>Festus.</hi> Be it knowne vnto your Lordships al, that as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the bishop of Rome, I nether hate the person, nor the place. For I ensure your Lordships, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuing Lorde beareth me witnesse before whome I speake, I doo thincke manye a good holy manne, manye martirs and Saintes of God, hath set and taught in that place, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes

Gospel truely: whiche therfore iustlye maye be called <hi>Apostolici,</hi> that is true Disciples of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. And also that Church and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregacion of Christians: Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church, yea and that certaine hundreth yeares after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same was first erected &amp; builded vpon Christ, by the true Apostolicall Doctrine, taught by the mouthes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles them selues.</p>
            <p>If ye will know how long that was, and how manye hundreth of yeares: to be curious in poyntinge the precise nomber of yeres, I wil not be to bold, but thus I say, so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and so manye hundred of yeres, as that sea did truely teach and preach that gospel, that religion, exercised that power, &amp; ordered euery thing by those lawes and rules, whyche that sea receiued of the Appostles (and as <hi>Tertulyan</hi> saithe) and the

From time I saye that the

state and condition of this Sea, hathe thus bene chaunged. In truthe it oughte of dutye and of righte to haue the names chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, bothe of the Sea, and of the sitter therein.</p>
            <p>For vnderstande my Lordes, it was neither for the Priuilege of that place or Persone thereof, that that Sea and Bishop thereof, wer called Apostolicke: but for the true trade of Christes Religion, whiche was taught and maintened in that Sea at the firste, and of those god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye menne.

The Sea is the seate of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and the Bishoppe of the same that mainteyneth the Abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, is Antichriste hym selfe in deede. And for the same causes this sea at this daye is the same whiche .s. Ihon calleth in his reuelacion, Babilon, or the whore of Babilon, and spiritually <hi>Sodoma</hi> and <hi>Egiptus,</hi> the mother of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of the abhominations vpon the earth. And with this hore doth spiritually mell and lies with her, and committeth most stincking and abhominable adultrye before God.

Hath the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so short since the death of the .ii last kinges, Henry the eight, &amp; Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his sonne, altered the nature of the matter? If it haue not, but was of the same nature and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then, as it is now, and be now, as it is saide by the Popes lawes, and the instructions sette forthe in English to the Curates of the dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Yorke, in deede a matter of necessitie to saluacion.

The hore of Babilon maywel for a time dally with you, and make you so dronke with the wine of her fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy stewes and horedome, as wyth her dispensacions and promises of

And as it hath bene of olde, that he whyche was borne after the fleshe, persecuteth him which was borne after the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. So it was in Isaackes time, so said Saint Peter, it was in his time also. And whether it be so or no nowe, let the spirituall man, the manne (I meane) that is indued with the spirite of God, let him be iudge. Of the crosse of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arckes, if ye reade the booke of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis, ye shall perceiue.</p>
            <p>Of other Saint Paule in fewe words comprehendeth much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, speaking in a generalitie of the wonderfull afflictions, death, and tormentes, whiche the men of God in Goddes cause, and for the truth sake, willingly did suffer after mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che perticuler rehearsall of manye, he saith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16419:48"/>Other were racked: and dispised to be redemed, that thei might obtain a better resurrection. Other again were tried with Mockinges and scourginges, and moreouer wyth bondes and imprisonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they wer stoned, hewen insunder, teinted, fel and were slain vpon the edge of the sworde, some wandred to and fro in shepes pilches, in gotes pilches, for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>saken, oppressed, afflicted, such god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye men as the world was vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of, wandering in wildernes, in mountains, in caues, and in dens. And all these were commended for their faithe. And yet they abide for vs the seruauntes of God, &amp; those their brethren, which are to be slain as they were for the word of Gods sake, that none be shut out, but that we may all go together to mete our maister Christ in thair at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge, &amp; so to be in blisse with him
<pb facs="tcp:16419:48"/>
in body and soule for euermore.</p>
            <p>Therfore seing we haue so much occasion to suffer and to take afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Christes name sake paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently: so many commodities therby so waighty causes, so manye good examples, so great necessity, so sure promises of eternall life, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ioyes of him that can not lye. Let vs throwe away what so euer might let vs, all burden of sinne, &amp; all kinde of carnalitie. And pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and constantlye let vs ronne for the best game, in this race that is set before vs, euer hauing our eyes vpon Iesus Christ the ringleader, capitain, and profiter of our faith, which for to haue the ioy set before him, suffered the crosse, not passing vpon ignomie and shame therof. &amp; is set nowe at the righthande of the throne of God Count this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered such strife of sinners against
<pb facs="tcp:16419:49"/>
him self, that ye should not geue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nor fainte in your mindes. As yet brethren we haue not withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto death, fighting against sinne. Let vs neuer forget (deare brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Christes sake) that fatherly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of the wise that speaketh vnto vs, as vnto his children, the godly wisdom of god, saying thus. My sonne dispise not the correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord, nor fal not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, when thou art rebuked of him. For whome the Lord loueth, him dothe he correct, &amp; scourgeth euery childe whome he receiueth, what child is he whome the father doth not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten? If ye be free from chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (wherof al are partners) then are ye bastardes and no children. Seing then when as we haue had carnall parents, which Christened vs, we reuerenced them: shall not we be much more subiect, vnto our
<pb facs="tcp:16419:49"/>
spiritual father? and shal liue. And they for a little time taughte vs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own mind: but this father teacheth vs to our commoditye, to geue vnto vs his holines. All cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement for the present time, ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not pleasant but painful. But afterward it rendereth the frute of righteousnesse on them, whiche are exercised in it. Wherefore let vs be of good chere (good brethren,) and lette vs plucke vp our feble mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres that were fallen or began to fainte, harte, hande, knees, and all the reaste, and lette vs walcke vp a righte and straighte, that no Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge nor Haulting bring vs oute of the waye. Let vs loke not vppon the thinges that be presente, but with the eies of our faithe, lette vs stedfastly beholde the thinges that be euerlasting in heauen.</p>
            <p>And chose rather in respecte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16419:50"/>
whiche is to come with the chosen members of Christ to beare Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes Crosse, then for his shorte life time to enioy all the riches, honors and pleasers of the brode world.</p>
            <p>Why shuld we Christians feare death? ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death depriue vs of Christ which is all our comfort, our ioy, &amp; our life? Nay forsoth. But contrary deathe shall deliuer vs from this mortall body, whiche lodeth &amp; bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth downe the spirite, that it can not so wel perceiue heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things in the which so longe as we dwell, we are absent from God.</p>
            <p>Wherfore vnderstandinge oure state in that we be Christians, that if our mortal bodye, whiche is oure earthlye house, were destroyed, we haue a building, a house not made with ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, but euerlasting in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. &amp;c. Therefore we are of good cheare, and knowe that when we
<pb facs="tcp:16419:50"/>
are in the body, we are absent from God. For we walcke by faithe, and not by cleare sighte. But we haue fiance, and had rather be from the body and present with God: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we striue whether we be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at home, or absent abrode that we maye alwaies please him. And who that hath true faith in our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioure Christ, wherby he knoweth somwhat truely what Christe oure sauioure is: that he is the eternall sonne of God, life, light, the wisdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of the father, all goodnes, al truth, all righteousnesse and whatsoeuer is good, that hart ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> desire, yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite plenty of al these aboue that, that mans hart can either conceiue or thinke. For in him dwelleth the fulnesse of the Godhed corporally. And also that he is geuen vs of the father: and made of God to be our wisdome, our righteousnesse, oure
<pb facs="tcp:16419:51"/>
holinesse, and oure redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? who I saye is he that beleueth this in dede, that wold not gladly be with his master Christ?</p>
            <p>Paule for this knowledge coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue bene losed from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, and to haue bene with Christ: For that, he compted muche better for him self, &amp; had rather to be losed then to liue. Therfore these words of Christ to the theife on the crosse, that asked of him mercye, were full of comforte, and solace. This daye thou shalte be with me in paradise. To dye in the defence of Christes Gospell, is oure bounden duetie to Christe, and also to oure neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. To Christ: for he died for vs, &amp; rose again y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he shuld be Lord ouer all. And seing he died for vs, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so (saith s. Ihon) shuld ieopard, yea, geue oure life for oure brethren. And this kinde of geuinge and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe,
<pb facs="tcp:16419:51"/>
is gettinge and winninge in deede. For he that geueth or loseth his life thus, getteth and winneth it for euermore.</p>
            <p>Blessed are they therefore that dieth in the Lorde. And if they dye also in the Lordes cause, they are mooste happye of all. Lette vs not feare then death, whiche can do vs no harme, otherwise then for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to make the flesh to smart: but that our faith which is fast fastned and fixed vnto the word of god, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs that we shall be anon after death in peace, in the hands of god, in ioy, in solace, and that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deathe we shall go straighte vnto life. For Ihon saieth, he that liueth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth in me shall neuer die: and in an other place: he shall depart from death into life.</p>
            <p>And therefore thys deathe of the christian, is not to be called deathe,
<pb facs="tcp:16419:52"/>
but rather a gate or entraunce into euerlasting life. Therefore Paule calleth it but a dissolution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And both Peter and Paul a puttinge of this Tabernacle or dwelling house, meaning thereby, the mortall bodye, as wherein the soule or spirite dothe dwell here in this world for a smal time. Yea this death may be called to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an an ende of all miseries. For so long as we liue here, we must passe through many tribulations before we can enter into the kingdome of heanen. And now after that death hath shot hys bolt, all the Christian mannes ennemies haue don what they can, and after that they haue no more to do. What could hurt, or harme poore Lazarus that laye at the ritch mannes gate, his former penury and pouerty, his miserable beggery and horrible sores &amp; sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes?
<pb facs="tcp:16419:52"/>
For so sone as death had stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him with his dart: so sone came the angels, and caried him vp into Abrahams bosome: what lost he by death? who from misery and paine is set forth by the ministery of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in a place both of ioye and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. Farewel deare brethren, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, and let vs comfort our hartes in all troubles and in deathe with the worde of God. For heauen and earth shal pearishe, But the worde of God endureth for euer.</p>
            <p>Farewel Christes dere beloued spouse, here wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring in this world as in a straunge lande farre from thine own country, and compassed about on euery hand with deadlye enemies which ceseth not to assalt the, euer seking thy destruction.</p>
