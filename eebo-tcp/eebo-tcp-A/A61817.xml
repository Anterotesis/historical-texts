         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT doth not a little trouble Me, to see how your Lordship is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
to that which will in the issue be Your own Destruction: I
am, and have bin no other then faithful to your Lordships Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Interest, so far as it can consist with your publick Interest:
I have absented my self five or six Dayes for no other reason. Let
me be bold to acquaint your Lordship, and tell you, that you do not
see your Interest, you are led out of one uncertainty to another, and
still will be, untill at last you have ruined, and lost all, and fall into
the hands of <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> as a prey; amongst the rest of absurd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
of Government that have been under consideration since the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
of the Parliament, they have bin no other then the worms
and <hi>Chimeraes</hi> of the Brains of such as have not the spirit of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
the last that have bin under your consideration is one of the
worst, and most Inconsistent that can be Imagined, and will produce
nothing but necessity for new Changes, which will not onely be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
in respect of publick Interest, but also to your Lordships
own Person; I presume that your Lordship doth not value your own
personal preservation above that of the Publick, also that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
knoweth it will be more Glory, and Honour, and Peace to
your own conscience, to contribute all the advantages you can to a
publick, Just, and Equal Settlement; then for you to sit at the top
of Affairs.</p>
                  <p>If that Government of twenty one, Conservators, of Exempting se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
Members, of Electing onely such as as have served seven years
in every Corporation, of Electing another House for the Negative
Voice out of that number of Men so chosen, with other things which
you shall after add, were the best Form under Heaven: Yet it will not
be indured or submitted unto, in regard the Original of it is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
Who by it designe a particular Interest, which shall alwayes
meet with a publick Interest, struggling with it, and by consequence
it will produce Changes. Besides, if your Lordship will only consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what benefit your Posterity shall have by a Government that must
run in so straight a Channel as it must: If the Army be the Legis-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59063:2"/>
and Law-givers, that is, to give Us a Form of Government;
your Posterity will be Slaves, unlesse you can Intail the Government
of the Army upon them; and make the Qualities they shall be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with, the Standard to measure out to the Nation what they
shall have, and what the Qualities are, that your Posterity, or our Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
shall be indowed with, whether with Vertue, Honour, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty;
or with Lust, Pride, Envy, Ignorance, or Inhumanity, none
knoweth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> If your Rules of Government be so short &amp; your qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
already made, be not enough; we presume we must have the rest
from the Army, as they declare by the words of their Vote, <hi>viz. such
Qualifications as are or shall be):</hi> I beseech your Lordship, at this rate,
where or when shall the <hi>Armies</hi> Legislating Power end? What
shall be a Period to it, that it shall go thus far and no farther? Can
your Lordship tell? If the Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> doth return Victor from

                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> I was in the General Council of Legislators,
holden in <hi>Wallingford</hi> Chappell, and You could scarcely
put Questions so fast as they were ready to pass them. A Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Council indeed! they will serve to promote, and carry any thing
On, that those that are uppermost propose to them: A Spirit of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
they have not; I saw they might be led by sence like Beasts:
They are a better Army then a Senate, if they would keep to their Duty
in Arms it would better b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>come Them. They are out of the Way
when they treat or meddle with Government; Your Declaration of
the 6th of <hi>May</hi> sayeth no less in these Words; <hi>We our Selves contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
thereto,</hi> And again, <hi>We have trod in and by Crooked Paths, and
the presence of the Lord hath departed from Us ever since We left the
Long Parliament.</hi> And my Lord, indeed the presence of the
Lord hath now departed from You, and will leave You quite if You
do not return thither again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> My Self of all men have little Reason to be their Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
they never did me any thing else than mischief; there was not
5 of them, I may say not 3 of them, that I knew or had any Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with, at their last Interruption. The principal Reason why I
do adhereto them is, I do dread and abhor the Settlement of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by an <hi>Army,</hi> I knowing that the Consequences will be fatal: your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59063:3"/>
Lordship knoweth, that when the Papers were sent up from <hi>Derby</hi>
to You, the next Morning I spake with You, and intreated You to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
with your Authority, to prevent the further Raveling into
that Matter; withal I told You, it would not rest in Petitioning on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yl,
but it would produce further Mischiefs. I have had the happiness
to foresee the Events of Publick Affaires for 10 years and upwards
last past, and now I am confident that the Parliament will again sit:
notwithstanding all the Opposition that can be made against them,
Nay, if there were not <hi>Monck</hi>'s <hi>Army,</hi> nor any other Endeavours
on foot, yet you would run your Selves into the Necessity of sitting
under them again, or <hi>Charles Stuart. My Lord,</hi> The Reasons and
Grounds I have for this Assertion are too large to communicate to
You in a Letter; I shall onely add this, that You may preserve your
Power, Honour, P<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>son, and All that you can imagine, by adhering
to them: I do know that hitherto nothing hath been done, but in
order thereunto; and with much respect to your Lordship, the same I
have done, I take God to witness: Now, if your Lordship shall think
it your Interest to adhere to the Lord <hi>Lambert,</hi> against the Interest of
the Publick, which cannot be secured any other way than by the sitting
again of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> the which if your Lordship will promote
you may have your own Terms, and may secure your Self against the
under-hand Dealing that is on foot, in the behalf of the Lord <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
the which (I can assure your Lordship) you cannot avoid, by any
other means. <hi>My Lord,</hi> I desire you seriously to consider the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
