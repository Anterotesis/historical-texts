            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YE may perceiue (right Worshipful) in perusing the former Epistle sent to mee, how sore I am befet with the importunities of my friends, to publish this Pamphlet: Truly I am and haue bin (if there be in me anie soundnes of iudgement) of this opinion, that whatsoeuer is committed to the presse is commended to eternitie, and it shall stand a liuely witnes with our conscience, to our comfort or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, in the reckning of that great daie.</p>
            <p>Aduisedly therefore was that Prouerbe vsed of our elder Philosophers, <hi>Manum a Tabula:</hi> with-hold thy hand from the paper, and thy papers from the print or light of the world: for a lewd word escaped is irreuocable, but a bad or base discourse published in print is intollerable.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I haue indured some conflicts between reason and iudgement, whether it were conuenient for the common wealth, with the <hi>indecorum</hi> of my calling (as some thinke it) that the memorie of <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creds</hi> Tragedie should be againe by my meanes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued, which the oftner I read ouer, and the more I considered theron, the sooner I was won to consent therunto: calling to mind that neither the thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend &amp; lerned father M. Beza, was ashamed in his yonger yeres, to send abroad in his owne name, his

Tragedy of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor that rare Scot (the scholer of ourage) <hi>Buchanan,</hi> his most pathetical <hi>Ieptha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed I must willingly confesse this Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These things noted herin, how simple so euer the verse be, I hope the matter wil be acceptable to the wise.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I am now bold to present <hi>Gismund</hi> to your sights, and vnto yours only, for therfore haue I coniured her, by the loue that hath bin these 24. yeres betwixt vs, that she waxe not so proude of her fresh painting, to stragle in her plumes abroad, but to contein her selfe within the walles of your house; so am I sure she shalbe safe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Tragedian Tyrants</hi> of our time, who are not ashamed to affirme that ther can no amarous poeme sauour of any sharpnes of wit, vnlesse it be seasoned with scurrilous words.</p>
            <p>But leauing them to their lewdnes, I hope you, &amp; all discreet readers, wil thankfully receiue my pains, the fruites of my first haruest: the rather, perceiuing that my purpose in this Tragedie, tendeth onely to the exaltation of vertue, &amp; suppression of vice, with pleasure to profit and help al men, but to offend, or hurt no man.

                     <l>For I am sure, and do ye all to wit,</l>
                     <l>Through griefe wherin the Lords of Salerne be,</l>
                     <l>These funerals are not prepared yet:</l>
                     <l>Nor do they think on that solemnitie.</l>
                     <l>As for the fury, ye must vnderstand,</l>
                     <l>Now she hath seen the'ffect of her desire,</l>
                     <l>She is departed, and hath left our land,</l>
                     <l>Graunting this end vnto her hellish ire.</l>
                     <l>Now humbly pray we that our English dames</l>
                     <l>May neuer lead their loues into mistrust:</l>
                     <l>But that their honors may auoid the shames</l>
                     <l>That follow such as liue in wanton lust.</l>
                     <l>We know they beare them on their vertues bold</l>
                     <l>With blisfull chastitie so wel content,</l>
                     <l>That when their liues, and loues abroad are told,</l>
                     <l>All men admire their vertuous gouernment.</l>
                     <l>Worthie to liue where Furieneuer came,</l>
                     <l>Worthie to liue where loue doth alwaies see,</l>
                     <l>Worthie to liue in golden trump of Fame,</l>
                     <l>Worthie to liue, and honoured stil to be.</l>
                     <l>Thus end our sorrowes with the setting Sun:</l>
                     <l>Now draw the curtens for our Scaene is done.</l>
