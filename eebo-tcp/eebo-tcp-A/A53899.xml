            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM cxi. 4.</bibl>
               <q>He hath made his wonderful works to be remembred.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis Psalm begins with an
<hi>Hallelujah,</hi> and wholly
consisteth of Praise and
Thanksgiving; in which
the People of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
a just resentment
and grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the chiefest mercies received by their
Fathers, referring them all to the goodness
of God, and jointly and publickly magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
his Name, as if it were previous to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93428:3"/>
the <hi>great voice of much people in Heaven</hi> heard
by S. <hi>John.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. xiv. 1.</note> The words are so indited by
the Spirit, so penned by the Prophet, that
they may be a perpetual Rule and Direction
in all ages to the Church, guided by the
same Providence, protected by the same
Power, to have the like sense, and render
the same Praise to him whose <hi>hand is not
shortened at all.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. l. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This Duty is here taught us in such a
manner as may render it most proper for
us to offer, most acceptable to him to whom
it is to be offered. The Expressions of the
Psalmist sufficiently inform us, that it must
be unfeigned and real, sincere and integral,
without any intervening doubts of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign
and immediate Influence, without <gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
thoughts or imaginations of any other
assistance, ascribing to him the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,<note place="margin">Psal. xxix. 2.</note>
rendring to him the whole <hi>glory
due unto his Name,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. ii. 11.</note> that he <hi>alone may be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi>
there is nothing less than this intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the first address, <hi>I will praise the Lord
with my whole heart.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 1.</note> The same must also
be publick and united, universal. and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
with a general consent and holy kind
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93428:3"/>
of conspiration; that the Praise to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
may bear some shew of proportion to
the Mercy received, and, as the Blessing, so
the Return, may be, without exception, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
performed <hi>in the assembly of the upright,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 1.</note>
               <hi>and in the congregation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duty thus taught and described is
next urged and inforced by expressing a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which hath a natural tendency to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
our performance, or rather to constrain
us. For <hi>the works of the Lord are great,</hi> ver. 2.
<hi>His work is honourable and glorious; and his
righteousness endureth for ever,</hi> ver. 3. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he sheweth, that in the extraordinary
works of God wrought for the benefit of
his people, the Attributes of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
manifestly appear; as his Wisdom in
contriving them, his Power in effecting
them, his Goodness in vouchsafing them,
his Justice in denying them to others, his
Mercy in conferring or confining them to
us; and at the same time informeth us, that
our Praise consisteth in the sole acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of these Attributes. For he whose
<hi>glorious Name is exalted above all blessing and
praise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. ix. 5.</note> cannot receive glory from us: <hi>our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93428:4"/>
goodness extendeth not to him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. xvi. 2.</note> he is only
glorified by the manifestation of himself,
with our acknowledgment and declaration
of the glorious Excellencies which are in
him, and the Emanations proceeding from
them.</p>
            <p>This general Reason is followed by a more
immediate, more concerning and convincing
Provocation to the same Duty; in that he
which hath done so great things for our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and promised the like to us, hath
also revealed the counsel of his will, and
his design in the doing of them, both for
our Benefit and his own Honour: that
there might be not onely a sufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to move and persuade us, but also an
express signification of his will to determin
and oblige us unto a perpetual and never-failing
Commemoration of his Goodness.
And the Revelation of this Design of God
is clearly delivered in the words of my Text,
<hi>He hath made his wonderful works to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not trouble you with any Division
of my Text, but only raise this Observation
from it which is naturally conteined in it:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93428:4"/>
               <hi>Where God hath wrought any signal work for
any People or Nation, he justly expecteth and
requireth a publick and perpetual Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it.</hi> The truth of this indubitable
Observation, as it is useful for many purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
so it is evident by innumerable instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
three of which are glanced at in this
short Psalm. First, <hi>He sent redemption unto
his people,</hi> ver. 9. that is, He sent <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> unto the <hi>Israelites,</hi> by whose hand he
brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi>
and certainly he made that wonderful work
to be remembred. For they obteined their
dimission by the intervention of a destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Angel, while the <hi>Egyptians</hi> perished and
they were preserved: upon which the Feast
of the Passeover was instituted, and with
this remark,<note place="margin">Exo. xii. 14.</note> 
               <hi>This day shall be to you for a
memorial: and ye shall keep it a feast to the
Lord throughout your generations: ye shall keep
it a feast by an ordinance for ever.</hi> Upon their
coming forth from thence, the Law of the
Sabbath was fixed to a certain day in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the same deliverance with the like
intimation. <hi>Remember that thou wast a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
in the land of Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. v. 15.</note> 
               <hi>and that the Lord
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93428:5"/>
thy God brought thee out thence through a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore
the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to keep
the Sabbath-day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>He hath given meat unto them
that fear him,</hi> ver. 5. that is probably, He fed
them miraculously when they cried unto him
in the wilderness; he gave them Manna,
even bread from Heaven, but with this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
<hi>Fill an Omer of it to be kept for your
generations, that they may see the Bread where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I have fed you in the wilderness.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exo. xvi. 32.</note> And
this wonderful work was made to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
not only in it self, but in its sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.<note place="margin">John vi. 41.</note>
For he which said, <hi>I am the bread
which came down from heaven,</hi> when he was
by his Death to deliver us from the wrath
of God, and to make a way open for us
to eternal Life, instituted the Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to this end, that <hi>as often as we eat that
bread and drink that Cup, we should shew the
Lords death till he come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>He gave them the heritage of the
heathen,</hi> ver. 6. that is, when the sins of the
<hi>Amorites</hi> were full, he drove out them and
their neighbouring Nations, that he might
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93428:5"/>
place his peculiar people in the promised
land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> He magnified <hi>Josuah,</hi> as
he had done <hi>Moses,</hi> in the sight of all <hi>Israel;</hi>
he cut off the waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> that the Ark
of the Covenant might pass before them, and
the people follow that, to take possession of
the Land. And lest the Memory of such a
wonderful work should perish, he caused
<hi>twelve stones taken out of the midst of Jordan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jos. iv. 3.</note>
               <hi>out of the place where the Priests feet stood firm,</hi>
to be laid in Gilgal, <hi>for a memorial to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel for ever.</hi>
               <note place="margin">7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Upon these and the like Instances, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the express Will and Revelation of
God, delivered in the writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and
the Prophets, preserved in the publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
and sacred Archives of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
the Church of God in after-ages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the same Rule, and without any scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
put upon themselves the same Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For having a due apprehension of the
great Equity and Justice of the thing it self
required, whensoever the like Goodness of
God was manifested to them, though his
Will was not expresly revealed, when his
Promises were fulfilled, though the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93428:6"/>
ceased, they thought it necessary to oblige
themselves and their Posterity to the Duty;
as knowing that Thankfulness is a necessary
virtue by the eternal Law of Nature, and
that the Design of God, who changeth not,
could not but be the same for his Glory,
whensoever he made the same Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Mercy. Thus the Jews in their
Dispersion, being saved from a National
Destruction, of themselves instituted the Feast
of Purim:<note place="margin">Esth. ix. 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>they ordeined and took upon them
and upon their seed, so that it should not fail,
that they would keep these two days every year;
And that these days should be remembred and
kept throughout every generation, every family,
every province, and every city; that these days
of Purim should not fail from among the Jews,
nor the memorial of them perish from their
seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is easie to derive and justifie a Doctrin
from so many holy Examples, all beyond
exception, all the safest Patterns for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
It is easie to improve it, if we will
attend not only to the Truth, but also to the
Reasons and the Use of it. And great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
there are, whether we consider the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93428:6"/>
received or the duty required. First,
in reference to any signal benefit, any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
mercy received, it is necessary we
should have a true sense and firm persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the work of God in it, that we
may learn to depend upon his Providence,
which we find so vigilant over us, so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to us; that we may attribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to our selves, or sacrifise to our own
nets; that we may discern his hand in his
own work, and say with the Prophet, <hi>I
will praise thy name for ever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. lii. 9.</note> 
               <hi>because thou hast
done it;</hi> that we may speak as unfeignedly,
as emphatically, <hi>To thee, O Lord, do we give
thanks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. lxxv. 1.</note> 
               <hi>to thee do we give thanks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this design of God teacheth
man to make a true estimate, and set a
value upon the benefit received as coming
from his hand. How great soever any
temporal deliverance may be, which beareth
proportion with the evil or danger esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
it can never be so great in it self as
in the consideration of the deliverer. No
enjoyment on earth can equal this assurance,
that the preserver of men careth for us, that
the Lord taketh pleasure in his people. We
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93428:7"/>
ought not to value so much any preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as his favour who preserveth us;
because <hi>his loving kindness is better than
life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. lxiii. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Again, in relation to the duty of a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
remembrance and sutable return of praise
and thanksgiving, this design of God ought
to be embraced with all comfort and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.
For what greater honour can man
receive, than that God should desire to be
honoured by him? What greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
can we have, than that he should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bless us, that he may receive praise
from us, and purchase his glory by the
expence of his goodness? If God, who
enjoyed himself alone from eternity, hath
made all things for the praise of his glory;
if he hath designed to bless us, that we
may glorifie him, and makes so advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
an interpretation of the return
of our thanks; if he hath thus <hi>made his
wonderful works to be remembred,</hi> nothing but
a wretched ingratitude can deprive us of
them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the equity and excellency of the
duty enforce the obligation. Here is not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93428:7"/>
any thing required, but what may be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
challenged, what cannot be with any
pretence denied. There is a moral obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between men, to <hi>render to every man
his due, honour to whom honour:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. xiii. 7.</note> and this
divine acknowledgment is required upon no
other terms,<note place="margin">Psal. xxix. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Give unto the Lord the praise
due unto his name.</hi> It is required in a due
proportion,<note place="margin">cl. 2.</note> 
               <hi>praise him according to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
greatness,</hi> according to the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. This is the exercise of the
blessed Saints and Angels in the nearest
view of his perfections: the language of
heaven is <hi>Alleluja;</hi> and there is nothing
more heavenly upon earth. For <hi>it is good
to sing praises unto our God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. cxlvii. 1. cvii. 8.</note> 
               <hi>for it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
and praise is comely. O that men would
therefore praise the Lord for his goodness, and
for his wonderful works to the children of
men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Am willing to suppose we may be in
some measure by this brief discourse
persuaded, that if this Nation hath received
any signal mercy as upon this day, we are
some way obliged to remember, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93428:8"/>
to give thanks for it. If we be
sensible of any extraordinary manifestation
of the goodness of God towards us, I hope
we shall not be so singular as to desert all
the examples of the people of God in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ages.</p>
            <p>And as to the certainty of the mercy, I
think we may safely say with the Prophet,
<hi>O Godm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. lxxi. 8.</note> 
               <hi>thou hast taught us from our youth,
and hitherto have we declared thy wondrous
works.</hi> We have been all brought up in
this persuasion: <hi>hitherto</hi> we have thought
the mercy great, and the duty necessary.
Certainly we may without vanity say,<note place="margin">Psal. xliv. 1.</note> 
               <hi>We
have heard with our ears, and our fathers have
told us of the great works which God wrought
for us in their days: Hitherto</hi> we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
them, and praised him. But if there
be any which speak so much of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
that we may give no credit to our
fathers: if they teach us that our eyes
and our hands daily deceive us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must take heed lest we believe what
we have heard with our ears: if in that
which we take to be so grand a conspiracy,
there was nothing of substance, but only
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93428:8"/>
the species of a treason; though the doctrin
you have heard, be good to other purposes,
yet as to this days assembly it will signifie
little.</p>
            <p>Being therefore the new Apologists for those
Popish Conspirators have invented those shifts
and excuses for them, which they themselves,
though great Masters in that <hi>Roman</hi> art, could
never pretend to, it will be necessary now to
shew how this doctrin is applicable to this
Nation, how the Text agreeth with the day.
<hi>God hath made his wonderful works to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,</hi>
saith the Prophet: this is the
rule. The work of this day was <hi>his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
work.</hi> The work of this day is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be forgotten: this I take to be our
cafe. We must acknowledge the first, or we
are most stupid and insensible; we must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the second, or we shall be most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
and ungrateful.</p>
            <p>First, the work of this day was <hi>his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
work.</hi> The providence of God is
concerned in all events, but is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
in his greatest mercies; the mercy
manifesting his goodness, the greatness his
power.<note place="margin">Matth. x. 29.</note> 
               <hi>One Sparrow shall not fall to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93428:9"/>
ground without our Father,</hi> saith our Blessed
Saviour; and can we believe that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of men should in that manner be
preserved from destruction without his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and fatherly concurrence? How low
soever their opinion of Hereticks be, as
they are pleas'd to call them, can we think
so many persons designed to slaughter were
not <hi>of more value than many sparrows?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. x. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Touch
not mine anointed,</hi> is the voice of God: shall
the King and the Royal Family, shall the
Nobles and Judges of the land, shall the
Church and People of God, shall all whose
lives are pretious in his sight, be saved at
once from utter destruction by any other
hand than his?</p>
            <p>Certainly either the design, or the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
was from God; except we place him,
as <hi>Epicurus</hi> did, without the world, and
wholly unconcerned in it. But that was
too black, too horrid, too impious, to be
ascribed to any but to the grand enemy
of God and man,<note place="margin">Eph. ii. 2.</note> 
               <hi>the spirit that worketh in
the children of disobedience.</hi> The deliverance
therefore was from him from whom he
fell, and by whom, though he continue
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93428:9"/>
               <hi>the prince of the power of the air,</hi> he is still
<hi>reserved in everlasting chains.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jude 6.</note> As the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chination
of so much mischief to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
bewrays the inveterate enmity of him
who incessantly <hi>seeketh whom he may devour;</hi>
so the prevention of so much cruelty is a
sufficient demonstration of God's Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Though many other Arguments might
be used to demonstrate that this was the
work,</hi> the wonderful work <hi>of God, yet I
shall make use onely of one more, drawn
from the words of God, and those very
remarkable.</hi> Isaiah <hi>xxix. 14, 15, and 16. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
Behold I will proceed to do a marvelous
work amongst this people, even a marvelous
work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their
wise men shall perish, and the understanding
of their prudent men shall be lost. Wo unto
them that seek deep to hide their counsel from
the Lord; and their works are in the dark,
and they say, Who seeth it? who knoweth
it? Surely their turning of things upside down
shall be esteemed as potters clay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:93428:10"/>Now if this be God's proceeding to his
marvelous works, as he himself assu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth us,
it was never more evident than in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and defeat of this conspiracy. For
never any sought so deep to hide their
counsel: never any work was so in the
dark. I speak not of the secret connivance
of the mischief in a cellar, but of their
horrid secrecy and combination under the
Seal of Sacramental Confession; which they
profess to be so sacred with them, that not
for the saving of a whole nation from the
greatest mischief imaginable it may be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
For, as they say, all men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Law of God to confess all
their sins to a Priest; and therefore the
Priest by the same Law is obliged in no
case to reveal them. For certainly God
never intended to impose so hard a necessity
on a sinner, as necessarily to lose one of the
two, either his temporal, or his eternal
life; his temporal, if he confess, his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
if he do not. Now if it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the Priest in any case to reveal the
confession, and not lawful for the sinner
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93428:10"/>
not to confess, he could not obtain eternal,
without manifest danger of his temporal,
life. O the subtilty of the doctrin! the
nicety of the practice! O the great <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Asylum! the happy security in the
pretence of penance to impenitent wretches!
Here they may freely open their tender
Consciences, and by a safe consultation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
advice in the worst of their designs
for the advancement of the Gospel, and the
propagation of the Faith. For they have
of late so fortified this Castle, that it is
become impregnable, though the Foundation
of it be laid on a Tradition of their own,
wholly unknown, as they have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
to the vast number of the Eastern
Churches.</p>
            <p>But if we grant the sacredness of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and the duty of Secrecy in the
Confessor, which I shall not deny; yet rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(which can judge what designs are fit
to be kept secret, and what not) will teach
all men, and some of their Divines have
formerly taught, that a private secret ought
to be revealed for a great and publick good,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93428:11"/>
for the prevention of a general evil, the
Confessor keeping the person confessing as
close and safe as he may. And if this
doctrin had been observed, our danger
could not have long continued, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in the mischief of the design, not in
the number or power of the persons enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and consequently had vanished as soon
as it was disclosed. But they were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
fortified against this truth. For,
that a private secret must yield to a great
and publick good, holds only, they say, in
those Countries where the Prince is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
who believes the great Religion of
private and Sacramental Confession, and
bears a great reverence unto it. And that
too, when that Catholick Prince is so pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and religious, that it may be rationally
presumed that he will by no means urge
the Confessor with dangerous or troublesom
interrogations, or in the least desire the
persons of the Traitors. Thus upon an
unjust supposal that our King was not a
Catholick, and consequently not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
both he and his kingdom were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93428:11"/>
excluded from the benefit of universal
reason and the doctrin of their most sober
Divines; and so their most pernicious <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
lay</hi> still <hi>in the deep,</hi> wrapt up in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of the Priest, who had been taught
that he knew it not as m<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> but as God,
and that it was not a natural or civil, but
a supernatural secret.</p>
            <p>Again, it was very unreasonable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the sacred power of the Seal to keep
the secrecy of this horrid Conspiracy; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there was not any Confession made of
a sin committed and repented of (which
only hath a proper tendency to Absolution)
but only of a crime intended and of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
resolution afterwards to commit it;
which is not to be esteemed under Penance
at all (except there can be penitence where
there is no penitent or pretender to be such)
neither is it capable of Absolution or any
benefit of Confession, being it is not in it
self Confession, but rather Consultation,
and that the worst imaginable, including a
resolute intention to commit the greatest
crime. In this many of their Doctors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93428:12"/>
and a Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath given a
full and clear resolution in the point. But
in the greatest danger we could receive no
benefit here, a new Distinction making up
the breach. For we must understand that
though it were not a formal, yet it was
a virtual Confession; though it were but a
Consultation, yet it had some reference to
a Sacramental Confession, either already
made, or in probability to be made here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
by virtue of which reference it was
to be under the same secrecy, and to have
the benefit of the same Seal, being under it
either directly or indirectly. Thus that
grand Conspiracy was consigned to take its
best opportunity; as needing no Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but in case of a failure or non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
And so this <hi>work</hi> was still <hi>in the
dark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover we might conceive our selves
safe from such a machination of any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
by that Divine determination. <hi>We
must not do evil that good may come of it.</hi>
For if <hi>their damnation</hi> were <hi>just,</hi> who
<hi>slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derously reported of S. Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. iii. 8.</note> that <hi>he said Let
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93428:12"/>
us do evil, that good may come;</hi> who could
imagin that in any case of conscience this
should be admitted? And indeed a great
scruple arose even in the minds of the
most confident Assassinates, whether the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and the innocent might be destroyed
and perish together. <hi>That be far from them
to do after this manner,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. xviii. 25.</note> 
               <hi>to slay the righteous
with the wicked; and that the righteous should
be as the wicked, that be far from them:</hi>
(though all ought to have been accounted
innocent in respect of them who had no
authority to make such a discrimination,
or to condemn and execute justice upon
either:) Yet the sacred Oracle could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin,
that if the good to be expected
were greater than the evil which was to
be executed, if the destruction of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
might be compensated by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
which followed; then it was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evidently lawful, but, so far as the
good exceeded the evil, meritorious. And
now let the evil be never so great, they
were sure in the opinion of those whom
they consulted, the propagation of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:93428:13"/>
Faith, the advancement of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Cause, the restitution of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Jurisdiction was the greatest good ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
to which the ruin of the nocent
or the innocent could bear no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>All this was <hi>sought in the deep to hide
their counsel:</hi> all this was wrought <hi>in the
dark;</hi> and they said often among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>Who seeth it? who knoweth it?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if, notwithstanding all this contrivance
of secrecy to hide their counsel, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Conspiracy was revealed, the snare dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
and <hi>their turning of things upside
down esteemed as the potters clay,</hi> God did
then <hi>proceed to do a marvelous work</hi> for this
people and nation, <hi>even a marvelous work
and a wonder. This is that which the Lord
hath done,</hi> and it were the greatest wonder
if it were not <hi>marvelous in our eyes.</hi> Which
is the first part of our Case.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The wonderful work of this
day is never to be forgotten. <hi>God hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
our lives by a great deliverance,</hi> as <hi>Joseph</hi>
said; and can we ever be ungrateful to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93428:13"/>
him who hath given us <hi>such a deliverance
as this,</hi> as <hi>Ezra</hi> speaks? What can we
ever expect to make us mindful, if upon
<hi>such a deliverance as this</hi> we prove forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?
The Text teacheth us that it is the
design of him who wrought it, that we
should remember it; and shall we fulfil
the design of our enemies, whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated?
Let them deny it, who may be
ashamed of the intended cruelty; let not
us forget it, who ought to rejoice in the
mercy; lest we be unmindful of him whose
the mercy was, and for which he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be honoured by us. God made the
memory of his wonderful works to be part
of the Religion of his antient people; such
were the Passeover and the Sabbath: let
us think it a part of our Religion to
remember this wonderful work. Let this
day <hi>never fail from among us, nor the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
of it perish from our seed.</hi> May we
never live to see those times, in which
the memory of this day shall be blotted
out, or rather cast out with indignation:
may we never hear of such an Act of Oblivion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:93428:14"/>Nor is it our Duty only to desire, but
also to endeavour the perpetuity of this
Recognition: and consequently to use the
just and proper means to perpetuate it. It
was our Religion, the setled Religion of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> which was then aimed at;
and nothing will preserve the due memory
of this day, but the preservation of that. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but that procured the enmity; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but that obteined the mercy. We know
no other reason why men of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but of a different persuasion in matters
of Religion, should so combine against us;
we are conscious of no other motive on our
part to incline the infinite goodness of God
to be so propitious to us; nor can any other
consideration without this set a sufficient va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
upon the mercy received. Let us therefore
<hi>earnestly contend for the Faith which was once
delivered unto the Saints:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jude 3.</note> Let us keep that
which was then preserved, if we expect
the generations to come should praise the
Lord for this deliverance. The persons are
now dead whose lives were then preserved;
if we suffer the same Religion to perish
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93428:14"/>
which was then so signally owned, there
will be little left for which the memory
should be continued. Thus let us endeavour
to perpetuate the memorial of this day, as the
most just and innocent revenge.</p>
            <p>But these things are in the hand of God;
that God who saved our late Sovereign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
upon this day, and suffered him to be
cruelly murthered upon another. When I
consider the present condition of our Church
and Nation, and fear that our <hi>sins</hi> begin
to be <hi>full;</hi> I cannot but think the enemies
of our Religion, the Papal Emissaries, have
now much an easier way to destroy it.
They shall not need to seek so far into the
deep, or to lay so vast a work in the dark:
but then I cannot chuse but remember
those words which I read so frequently in
the Scriptures,<note place="margin">2 Sam. xvi. 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>God save the King: God save
the King</hi> God save him from the open
rebellion of the Schismatical party, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of his Father. God save him from the
secret machinations of the Papal Faction,
the danger of his Grandfather. <hi>God save the
King;</hi> and let all the people say, <hi>Amen.</hi>
