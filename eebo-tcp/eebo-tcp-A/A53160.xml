            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout the beginning of <hi>October</hi> last, foure <hi>English</hi> Ships, the one from <hi>Rye,</hi> the other from <hi>Bastable,</hi> the third from <hi>Apsum,</hi> and the fourth from <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> being bound homeward from Rochell, after a day and a nights sayle, it was their fortune to meete with a Turkish

man of War of Sally, who being well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with small resistance tooke them (they being Merchants men and not for service) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them to Sally, where after some few daies arrivall, one of each Ship was sold to a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of Argier for Slaves, who having not opportunity of passage remained some dayes in Sally with his Slaves, in which time hee gave order that Shackles should be made for each slave weighing fifty pound weight, but the Lord most graciously delivered them after this manner; viz. for being chained every night (as the custome is) to an Iron Bar untill their Shackles were made, and in the day time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployd about the Towne, they found meanes to speake with a Portugall slave concerning their escape, who assured them that if they could conveniently get out of the town, they might take their course along the sea shore, and in three or foure houres they may recover a towne of the Spaniards, not distant from that place above eighteene miles; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving learn, tthey imploy their best indeavours for their escape, so that having gotten a peice
<pb facs="tcp:63023:3"/>
of Clay, and finding opportunity to make the impression of the key of their Prison in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid clay, by which they made a wooden key, and making tryall found that it would stand them in stead; the night before they should have departed for Argier, and that their shackles should have been put on, having got a strong naile, they begun about twelve a clock to tamper with the lock which held the chaine to the iron barre, to which they were fastened; but having spent two houres, and not being able to pick the lock, despairing of their purpose, layd themselves down to sleep: but God putting into the heart of <hi>Iames Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> (Master of that ship from Rye) once more to assay the lock, rose up, and being next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lock, at the very first triall opened it; which having done, opened the doore with the woodden key; then comming to another doore, they easily lifted it off from the hooks with an iron bar which they there found; so likewise a third doore, which lead them into the street. But mark the wonderfull works of the Lord, for all the time that this was a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:63023:4"/>
a dog continued barking in the house, which their Patron and another Turk never heard, although they lay the very next wall unto them. So being come into the street, the one having the iron bar, the other an axe, the third a staffe, and the fourth an iron ladle (such as they melt lead in) they ran presently to the Towne wall, and leaped downe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any harme, it being eighteene foot high, and so took their way towards the shore, not meeting with any Scouts or Watch in all the way. After which, as the Portugall directed them, they run along the sea-shore, in far more danger of the wild beasts (which use to haunt those places) than formerly they were of the Turk their Master; but God which delivered them out of the hands of the one, saved them also from the jawes of the other: For they met but with one wild Bore, who so soone as he had set eye on them, fled from them. They did heare in divers places the barking of a small beast, which usually followes the Lions, by which they ghessed divers Lions were thereabout, but met with none. So with run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb facs="tcp:63023:4"/>
by break of day they obtained the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Towne, where the Governour gave them noble entertainment, and within the space of an houre, took them into a Turret, where hee shewed them 24 Turkish Horse-men, which had pursued them, but God be praised, they were out of their reach. The Iron Bar, the Axe, and the Ladle, the Governour hanged up in the chiefe Church of the Towne, in memoriall of their strange delivery. So ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occasion of passage for Cales, they came away from thence, and finding a Dover ship at Cales, came for England, where they now are to give God praise for their safe delivery.</p>
