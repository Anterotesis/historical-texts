            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Madam, when I received your Commands for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersing
some Copies of this Sermon, I perceived it
was too little to be presented to your Eminence; and
if it were accompanied with <hi>something else</hi> of the like
nature, it might with more profit advance that end
which your Grace so piously designed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have taken this opportunity to satisfie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

Personages, who required that the two following <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
should also be made fit for the use of those who
hoped to receive profit by them. I humbly lay them

                  <p>REwards and Punishments are the best Sanction of Laws;
and although the Guardians of Laws strike somtimes with
the softest part of the hand in their Executions of sad Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
yet in the Sanction they make no abatements, but
so proportion the Duty to the Reward, and the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Crime, that by these we can best tell what Value the Law-giver
puts upon the Obedience. <hi>Joshuah</hi> put a great rate upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Kiriath-Sepher,</hi> when the Reward of the Service was his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and a Dower. But when the Young men ventur'd to fetch <hi>David</hi>
the waters of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> they had nothing but the praise of their Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
because their Service was no more than the satisfaction of a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity.
But as Law-givers by their Rewards declare the Value of the
Obedience, so do Subjects also by the <hi>grandeur</hi> of what they expect, set
a value on the Law and the Law-giver, and do their Services accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 19.</note> whose endearment was nothing but
temporal goods and transient evils, could never make the comers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
perfect: but the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>Superinduction of a
better Hope</hi> hath endeared a more perfect Obedience. When Christ
brought <hi>Life and Immortality to light through the Gospel,</hi> and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to us things greater than all our explicite Desires, bigger than the
thoughts of our heart, then <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, saith the Apostle, <hi>then we
draw neer to God;</hi> and by these we are enabled to do all that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and then he requires all that we can do; more Love, and more
Obedience than he did of those who for want of these Helps, and these
Revelations, and these Promises, which we have, but they had not,
were but imperfect persons, and could do but little more than humane
Services. Christ hath taught us more, and given us more, and promised
to us more than ever was in the world known or believed before him;
and by the strengths and confidence of these, thrusts us forward in a holy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56643:7"/>
and wise Oeconomy, and plainly declares that we must serve him by
the measures of a new Love, do him Honour by wise and material Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications,
be united to God by a new Nature, and made alive by a
new Birth, and fulfil all Righteousness; to be humble and meek as
Christ, to be merciful as our heavenly Father is, to be pure as God is
pure, to be partakers of the Divine Nature, to be wholly renewed in
the frame and temper of our mind, to become people of a new heart,
a direct new Creation, new Principles, and a new being, to do better
than all the world before us ever did, to love God more perfectly, to
despise the World more generously, to contend for the Faith more
earnestly; for all this is but a proper and a just consequent of the great
Promises which our Blessed Law-giver came to publish and effect for all
the world of Believers and Disciples.</p>
                  <p>The matter which is here requir'd is certainly very great; for it is to
be more righteous than the Scribes and Pharisees; more holy than the
Doctors of the Law, than the Leaders of the Synagogue, than the wise
Princes of the <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> more righteous than some that were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and High Priests, than some that kept the Ordinances of the Law
without blame; men that lay in Sackcloth, and fasted much, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more, and made Religion and the Study of the Law the work of their
lives: This was very much; but Christians must do more.
<q>
                        <l>Nuncte marmoreum pro tempore fecimus; at tu,</l>
                        <l>Si foetura gregem suppleverit, aureus esto.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They did well, and we must do better; their houses were Marble,
but our roofs must be gilded and fuller of Glory. * But as the matter
is very great, so the necessity of it is the greatest in the world. It must
be so, or it will be much worse: unless it be thus, we shall never see the
glorious Face of God. Here it concerns us to be wise and fearful; for
the matter is not a question of an Oaken Garland, or a Circle of Bays,
and a Yellow Ribband: it is not a question of Money or Land, nor of
the vainer rewards of popular noises, and the undiscerning Suffrages of
the people, who are contingent Judges of good and evil: but it is the
great stake of Life Eternal. We cannot be Christians, unless we be
righteous by the new measures: the Righteousness of the Kingdom is
now the only way to enter into it; for the Sentence is fix'd, and the
Judgment is decretory, and the Judge infallible, and the Decree irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:
<hi>For I say unto you,</hi> said Christ, <hi>unless your Righteousness exceed the
Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here then we have two things to consider. 1. What was the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of the Scribes and Pharisees. 2. How far that is to be exceeded
by the Righteousness of Christians.</p>
                  <p>1. Concerning the first. I will not be so nice in the Observation of
these words, as to take notice that Christ does not name the <hi>Sadduces,</hi>
but the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> though there may be something in it: the
<hi>Sadduces</hi> were called <hi>Caraim</hi> from <hi>Cara,</hi> to read; for they thought it
Religion to spend one third part of their day in reading their Scriptures,
whose fulness they so admired, they would admit of no suppletory Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:
But the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were called <hi>Thanaim,</hi> that is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, they
added to the Word of God words of their own, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
does at this day; they and these fell into an equal fate; while they
<hi>taught for Doctrines the Commandments of men,</hi> they prevaricated the
Righteousuess of God: What the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to evil purposes hath
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56643:7"/>
done in this particular, may be demonstrated in due time and place;
but what false and corrupt glosses, under the specious Title of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of their Fathers, the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had introduc'd, our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
reproves; and are now to be represented as the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that
you may see that Righteousness beyond which all they must go that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that Heaven should be their Journeys end.</p>
                  <p>1. The Pharisees obeyed the Commandments in the Letter, not in the
Spirit: They minded what God spake, but not what he intended. They
were busie in the outward work of the hand, but incurious of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and choice of the heart. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, said <hi>Justin
Martyr</hi> to <hi>Tryphon</hi> the Jew, Ye understand all things carnally 3 that is,
they rested <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> calls it, in the outward work
of Piety, which not only <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> but St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Carnality,</hi> not
meaning a carnal Appetite,<note place="margin">Ga. 3. 3. &amp; Gal. 6. 12, 13. Phil. 3. 34.</note> but a carnal Service. Their errour was
plainly this; they never distinguish'd Duties natural from Duties rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
that is, whether it were commanded for it self, or in order to
something that was better; whether it were a principal Grace, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
Action: So God was served in the Letter, they did not much
inquire into his Purpose: And therefore they were curious to wash
their hands, but cared not to purifie the hearts; They would give
Alms, but hate him that received it; They would go to the Temple,
but did not revere the Glory of God that dwelt there between the
Cherubins; They would fast, but not mortifie their Lusts; They would
say good Prayers, but not labour for the Grace they prayed for. This
was just as if a man should run on his Masters errand, and do no busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
when he came there. They might easily have thought that by the
Soul only a man approaches to God, and draws the Body after it; but
that no washing or corporal Services could unite them and the <hi>Shechina</hi>
together, no such thing could make them like to God, who is the Prince
of Spirits. * They did as the Dunces in <hi>Pythagoras</hi> School, who when
their Master had said, <hi>Fabis abstineto,</hi> by which he intended <hi>they should
not ambitiously seek for Magistracy,</hi> they thought themselves good <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans</hi>
if they <hi>did not eat Beans,</hi> and they would be sure to put
their Right foot first into the shooe, and their Left foot into the water,
and supposed they had done enough; though if they had not been Fools
they would have understood their Masters meaning to have been, that
<hi>they should put more affections to labour and travel, and less to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and recreation;</hi> and so it was with the <hi>Pharisee:</hi> For as the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi>
taught their Mora<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>y by mystick words, and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroglyphicks,
and the <hi>Greeks</hi> by Fables; so did God by Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
external, leading them by the Hand to the Purities of the Heart,
and by the Services of the Body to the Obedience of the Spirit; which
because they would not understand, they thought they had done
enough in the observation of the Letter.</p>
                  <p>2. In moral Duties, where God express'd Himself more plainly,
they made no Commentary of kindness; but regarded the Prohibition
so nakedly, and divested of all Antecedents, Consequents, Similitudes,
and Proportions, that if they stood clear of that hated name which
was set down in <hi>Moses</hi> Tables, they gave themselves liberty in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the same kindred and alliance: If they abstained from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they thought it very well, though they made no scruple of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
their Brothers Fame; they would not cut his throat, but they
would call him Fool, or invent lies in secret, and publish his disgrace
openly; they would not dash out his brains, but they would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56643:8"/>
and unreasonably angry with him; they would not steal their
brothers money, but they would oppress him in crafty and cruel bargains.
The Commandment forbade them to commit Adultery, but because
Fornication was not named, they made no scruple of that; and being
commanded to Honour their Father and their Mother, they would give
them good words and fair observances; but because it was not named
that they should maintain them in their need, they thought they did
well enough to pretend <hi>Corban,</hi> and let their Father starve.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> placed their Righteousness in Negatives;
they would not commit what was forbidden, but they car'd but little for
the included positive, and the omissions of good Actions did not much
trouble them; they would not hurt their brother in a forbidden instance,
but neither would they do him good according to the intention of the
Commandment: It was a great innocence if they did not rob the poor,
then they were righteous men; but they thought themselves not much
concerned to acquire that god-like excellency, a <hi>Philanthropy</hi> and love to
all mankind: Whosoever blasphem'd God was to be put to death; but
he that did not glorifie God as he ought, they were unconcern'd for him,
and let him alone: He that spake against <hi>Moses</hi> was to die without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
but against the ambitious and the covetous, against the proud man
and the unmerciful, they made no provisions.
<q>
                        <l>Virtus est vitium fugere, &amp; sapientia prima</l>
                        <l>Stultitiâ caruisse.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They accounted themselves good, not for doing good, but for doing no
evil; that was the sum of their Theology.</p>
                  <p>4. They had one thing more as bad all this: They broke <hi>Moses</hi> Tables
into pieces, and gathering up the fragments took to themselves what part
of Duty they pleased, and let the rest alone: For it was a Proverb amongst
the Jews, <hi>Qui operam dat praecepto, liber est à praecepto;</hi> that is, If he chuses
one positive Commandment for his business, he may be less careful in any
of the rest. Indeed they said also, <hi>Qui multiplicat Legem, multiplicat Vitam;</hi>
He that multiplies the Law increa<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s Life; that is, if he did attend to more
good things, it was so much the b<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tter; but the other was well enough:
but as for Universal Obedience, that was not the measure of their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
for they taught that God would put our good works and bad
into the balance, and according to the heavier scale give a portion in the
world to come; so that some evil they would allow to themselves and
their Disciples, always provided it was less than the good they did.
They would devour Widows houses, and make it up by long Prayers:
They would love their Nation, and hate their Prince; offer Sacrifice,
and curse <hi>Caesar</hi> in their heart; advance Judaism, and destroy Humanity.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, St. <hi>Austin</hi> summ'd up the difference between the Pharisaical
and Evangelical Righteousness in two words; <hi>Brevis differentia inter
Legem &amp; Evangelium; timor &amp; amor.</hi> They serv'd the God of their
Fathers in the spirit of Fear, and we worship the Father of our Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
in the Spirit of Love, and by the Spirit of Adoption. And as this
slavish Principle of theirs was the cause of all their former Imperfections,
so it finally and chiefly express'd it self in these two particulars. 1. They
would do all that they thought they lawfully could do. 2. They
would do nothing but what was expresly commanded.</p>
                  <p>This was the Righteousness of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and their
Disciples the Jews; which because our Blessed Saviour reproves,<note place="margin">Sed Belzebulis callida Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta Christus destruit.</note> not
only as imperfect then, but as criminal now, calling us on to a new Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
the Righteousness of God, to the Law of the Spirit of Life,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56643:8"/>
to the Kingdom of God and the proper Righteousness thereof, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
us in the next place to look after the measures of this, ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that it is infinitely necessary that we should do so; and men do not
generally know, or not consider what it is to be a Christian; they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not what the Christian Law forbiddeth or commandeth. But as
for this in my Text, it is indeed our great measure: but it is not a
question of good and better, but of Good and Evil, Life and Death,
Salvation and Damnation; for unless our Righteousness be weighed by
new Weights, we shall be found too light, when God comes to weigh
the Actions of all the World: and unless we be more righteous than
they, we <hi>shall in no wise,</hi> that is, upon no other terms in the world,
<hi>enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now concerning this, we shall do very much amiss, if we take our
measures by the Manners and Practises of the many who call themselves
Christians; for there are, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> expresses it, the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the old and the new <hi>Pharisees.</hi> I wish it were no worse amongst us;
and that all Christians were indeed Righteous as they were; <hi>est aliquid
prodire tenus;</hi> it would not be just nothing. But I am sure that to bid
defiance to the Laws of Christ, to laugh at Religion, to make a merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the debauchery and damnation of our Brother, is a state of
evil worse than that of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees:</hi> and yet even among
such men how impatient would they be, and how unreasonable would
they think you to be, if you should tell them, that there is no present
hopes or possibility that in this state they are in they can be saved!

and as long as men live at the rate they do, it will be to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to talk of exceeding the Righteousness of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees:</hi>
but because it must be much better with us all, or it will be very much
worse with us at the latter end, I shall leave complaining and go to the
Rule, and describe the necessary and unavoidable measures of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
Evangelical, without which we can never be saved.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore when it is said our <hi>Righteousness must exceed that of the
Scribes and Pharisees,</hi> let us first take notice by way of praecognition,
that it must at least be so much: we must keep the Letter of the whole
Moral Law; we must do all that lies before us, all that is in our hand:

all; Let us remember this, that Christianity is the most profitable,
the most useful, and the most bountiful institution in the whole world,
and the best definition I can give of it is this; It is <hi>the Wisdom of God
brought down among us to do good to men;</hi> and therefore we must not do
less than the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who did the outward work; at least let us be sure
to do all the work that is laid before us in the Commandments. And
it is strange that this should be needful to be press'd amongst
Christians whose Religion requires so very much more. But so it is,
upon a pretence that we must serve God with the mind, some are such
fools as to think that it is enough to have a good meaning. <hi>Iniquum perpol

to die in a humour, and lay aside the Body. *This is a taking away
the Subject of the Question; for our inquiry is, How we should keep the
Commandments; how we are to do the work that lyes before us, by
what Principles, with what Intention, in what Degrees, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>ut bonum bene fiat,</hi> that the good thing be done well. This therefore
must be presupposed; we must take care that even our Bodies bear a part
in our Spiritual Services. Our voice and tongue, our hands and our Feet,
and our very bowels must be servants of God, and do the work of the
Commandments.</p>
                  <p>This being ever supposed, our Question is, how much more we must
do; and the first measure is this; Whatsoever can be signified and ministred
to by the Body, the Heart and the Spirit of a man must be the principal
Actor. We must not give Alms without a charitable Soul, nor suffer
Martyrdom but in Love and in Obedience; and when we say our
Prayers, we do but mispend our time unless our mind ascend up to God
upon the wings of desire.</p>
                  <p>Desire is the life of prayer; and if you indeed desire what you pray
for, you will also labour for what you desire; and if you find it otherwise
with your selves, your coming to Church is but like the <hi>Pharisees</hi> going
up to the Temple to pray. If your heart be not present, neither will
God; and then there is a sound of men and women between a pair of
dead walls, from whence because neither God nor your Souls are present,
you must needs go home without a Blessing.</p>

But this measure of Evangelical Righteousness is of principal remark
in all the rites and solemnities of Religion; and intends to say this, that
Christian Religion is something that is not seen, it is the hidden man of
the heart; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it is God that dwels within; and true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

                     </gap>, clothed
with a great deal of mind. And therefore those words of the Prophet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea,
Et loquar ad cor ejus, I will speak unto their heart;</hi> is a proverbial expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
signifying to speak spiritual comforts, and in the mystical sence signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, to preach the Gospel; where the Spirit is the Preacher, and
the Heart is the Disciple, and the Sermon is of Righteousness and Peace,
and Joy in the Holy Ghost. Our Service to God must not be in outward
works and Scenes of Religion, it must be something by which we become
like to God; the Divine Prerogative must extend beyond the outward
man; nay, even beyond the mortification of Corporal vices; the Spirit of
God must go <hi>in trabis crassitudinem,</hi> and mollify all our secret pride, and
ingenerate in us a true humility, and a Christian meekness of Spirit, and
a Divine Charity. For in the Gospel, when God enjoyns any external
Rite or Ceremony, the outward work is always the less principal. For
there is a bodily and a carnal part, an outside and a Cabinet of Religion
in Christianity it self. When we are baptized, the purpose of God is that
we cleanse our selves from all pollution of the Flesh and Spirit, and then
we are indeed <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, clean all over. And when we communicate, the
Commandment means that we should be made one Spirit with Christ,
and should live on him, believing his Word, praying for his Spirit, support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his Hope, refreshed by his Promises, recreated by his Comforts,
and wholly and in all things conformable to his Life; that is the true
Communion. The Sacraments are not made for Sinners until they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
they are the food of our Souls, but our Souls must be alive unto
God, or else they cannot eat; It is good to <hi>confess our sins,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi>
sayes, and to open our wounds to the Ministers of Religion, but they
absolve none but such as are are truly penitent.</p>
                  <p>Solemn Prayers, and the Sacraments, and the Assemblies of the Faithful,
and fasting days, and acts of external worship, are the solemnities and rites
of Religion; but the Religion of a Christian is in the Heart and Spirit. And
this is that by which <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> defined the Righteousness of a
Christian, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: all the parts and faculties that
make up a man, must make up our Religion; but the heart is <hi>Domus prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalis,</hi>
it is the Court of the great King; and he is properly served with
interior graces and moral Vertues, with a humble and a good mind, with a
bountiful heart, and a willing Soul, and these will command the eye, and
give laws to the hand, and make the shoulders stoop; but <hi>anima cujusque
est quisque;</hi> a mans soul is the man, and so is his Religion; and so you are
bound to understand it.</p>
                  <p>True it is, God works in us his Graces by the Sacrament; but we must
dispose our selves to a reception of the Divine blessing by Moral instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The Soul is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it must work together with God, and
the body works together with the soul: But no external action can
purifie the soul, because its Nature and Operations being Spiritual it can
no more be changed by a Ceremony or an external Solemnity, than an
Angel can be caressed with sweet Meats, or a a Mans belly can be filled
with Musick or long Orations. The sum is this: No Christian does his
Duty to God but he that serves him with all his heart: And although it
becomes us to fulfil all righteousness, even the external also; yet that
which makes us gracious in his Eyes is not the external, it is the love of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56643:10"/>
the heart and the real change of the mind and obedience of the spirit;
that's the first great measure of the Righteousness Evangelical.</p>
                  <p>2. The Righteousness Evangelical must exceed that of the <hi>Scribes</hi>
and <hi>Pharisees</hi> by extension of our Obedience to things of the same
signification; <hi>Leges non ex verbis, sed ex mente intelligendas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De legib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> l, scire</note> sayes
the Law. There must be a Commentary of kindness in the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Laws of Christ. We must understand all Gods meaning;
we must secure his service, we must be far removed from the dangers
of his displeasure. And therefore our Righteousness must be the
purification and the perfection of the Spirit. So that it will be nothing
for us not to commit Adultery, unless our Eyes and Hands be chast,
and the desires be clean. A Christian must not look upon a woman to
lust after her. He must hate Sin in all dimensions, and in all distances,
and in every angle of its reception. A Christian must not sin, and he must
not be willing to sin if he durst. He must not be lustful, and therefore
he must not feed high, nor drink deep, for these make provisions for lust:
and amongst Christians, great eatings and drinkings are acts of uncleanness
as well as of intemperance, and whatever ministers to sin, and is the way
of it; partakes of its nature and its curse.</p>
                  <p>For it is remarkable that in good and evil the case is greatly different.
Mortification (<hi>e. g</hi>) is a duty of Christianity; but there is no Law
concerning the Instruments of it. We are not commanded to roll our
selves on thorns, as St. <hi>Benedict</hi> did; or to burn our flesh, like St. <hi>Martini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi>
or to tumble in Snows with St. <hi>Francis;</hi> or in pools of water with
St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> A man may chew <hi>Aloes,</hi> or ly upon the ground, or wear
sackcloth if he have a mind to it, and if he finds it good in his circumstances
and to his purposes of mortification; but it may be he may do it alone by
the Instrumentalities of Fear and Love; and so the thing be done, no
special Instrument is under a command. *But although the Instruments
of vertue are free, yet the Instruments and ministeries of vice are not.
Not only the sin is forbidden, but all the wayes that lead to it. The
Instruments of vertue are of themselves indifferent, that is, not naturally,
but good only for their relation sake, and in order to their end. But the
Instruments of vice are of themselves vitious; they are part of the sin, they
have a share in the phantastick pleasure, and they begin to estrange a
mans heart from God, and are directly in the prohibition. For we are
commanded to fly from temptation, to pray against it, <hi>to abstain from all
appearances of evil,</hi> to make a covenant with our eyes, to pluck them
out if there be need. And if Christians do not understand the
Commandments to this extension of signification, they will be innocent
only by the measures of humane Laws, but not by the righteousness
of God.</p>
                  <p>3. Of the same consideration it is also that we understand Christs
Commandments to extend our Duty, not only to what is named, and
what is not named of the same nature and design; but that we abstain
from all such things as are like to sins. * Of this nature there are many.
All violences of Passion, Irregularities in Gaming, Prodigality of our
time, Undecency of action, doing things unworthy of our Birth or our
Profession, aptness to go to Law; <hi>Ambitus,</hi> or a fierce prosecution even
of honourable employments; misconstruction of the words and actions
of our brother; easiness to believe evil of others, willingness to report the
evil which we hear; curiosity of Dyet, peevishness toward servants,
indiscreet and importune standing for place, and all excess in ornaments;
for even this little instance is directly prohibited by the Christian and

Royal Law of Charity. For <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

Every thing that is not wisely useful or proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned

                     </gap>, it is a vaunting, which the Charity and the Grace of a
Christian does not well endure. * These things are like to sins, they
are of a suspicious nature, and not easily to be reconcil'd to the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
Evangelical. It is no wonder if Christianity be nice and curious; it
is the cleanness and the purification of the Soul, and Christ intends to
present his Church to God <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

any such thing.</hi> N. B. <hi>or any such thing.</hi> If there be any irregularity that
is less than a wrinkle, the Evangelical Righteousness does not allow
it. * These are such things which if men will stand to defend, possibly
a modest Reprover be more ashamed than an impudent Offender. * If I
see a person apt to quarrel, to take every thing in an ill sence, to resent
an error deeply, to reprove it bitterly, to remember it tenaciously, to
repeat it frequently, to upbraid it unhandsomly, I think I have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to say, that this person does not do what becomes the sweetness of a
Christian Spirit. If it be replied, It is no where forbidden to chide an
offending person, and that it cannot be a fault to understand when a thing
is said or done amiss. I cannot return an answer, but by saying, That sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
nothing of it were a sin, yet that every thing of it is so like a sin, that
it is the worse for it; and that it were better not to do so; at least I think
so, and so ought you too, if you be curious of your eternal interest: a little
more tenderness here would do well. I cannot say that this dress, or this
garment, or this standing for place is the direct sin of pride; but I am sure
it looks like it in some persons; at least the letting it alone is much better,
and is very like humility. And certain it is, that he is dull of hearing who
understands not the voice of God, unless it be clamorous in an express and
a loud Commandment, proclaimed with Trumpets and Clarions upon
mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> but a willing and an obedient ear understands the still voice
of Christ, and is ready to obey his meaning at half a word; and that is the
Righteousness Evangelical. It not only abstains from sins named, and sins
implied, but from the beginnings and instruments of sin; and from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is like it. The Jews were so great haters of Swine upon pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

things behind, which although I must croud up into a narrow room,
yet I must not wholly omit them: therefore,</p>
                  <p>4. The fourth thing I shall note to you is, that whereas the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> was but a fragment of the broken Tables of <hi>Moses;</hi>
the pursuance of some one Grace, <hi>laoinia sanctitatis,</hi> a piece of the robe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56643:11"/>
of Righteousness; the Righteousness Evangelical must be like Christs
seamless Coat, all of a piece from the top to the bottom; it must invest
the whole Soul: <hi>Misma, Dumah, Massah,</hi> said the Proverb of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,
It is this, and it is the other, and it must be all, it must be an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Righteousness; not a little knot of holy actions scattered in our
lives, and drawn into a sum at the day of Judgment, but it must be a
state of holiness. It was said of the <hi>Paphlagonian</hi> Pigeons <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, every one of them had two hearts;<note place="margin">Prov: 28. 14.</note> but that in our mystical
Theology signifies a wicked man. So said <hi>Solomon, The perverse or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     </gap>, so St. <hi>James</hi>
expresses an unbeliever; a man that will and will not; something he
does for God, and something for the world; he hath two minds, and in
a good fit, in his well dayes he is full of Repentance, and overflows in
piety; but the Paroxism will return in the day of temptation, and then
he is gone infallibly. But know this, that in the Righteousness Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical,
one duty cannot be exchanged for another, and three vertues will
not make amends for one remaining vice. He that oppresses the poor,
cannot make amends by giving good Counsel; and if a Priest be Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naical,
he cannot be esteemed righteous before God by preaching well,
and taking care of his Charge. To be zealous for God and for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is good, but that will not legitimate cruelty to our Brother. It is
not enough for a man to be a good Citizen, unless he be also a good
man; but some men build their houses with half a dozen cross sticks,
and turfe is the foundation, and straw is the covering, and they think
they dwell securely; their Religion is made up of two or three vertues,
and they think to commute with God, some good for some bad, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

Some men are very meek and gentle naturally, and that they serve God
withal; they pursue the vertue of their nature: that is, they tye a stone
at the bottom of the well, and that's more than needs; the stone will
stay there without that trouble; and this good inclination will of it self
easily proceed to issue; and therefore our care and caution should be
more carefully employed in mortification of our natures, and acquist of
such vertues to which we are more refractory, and then cherish the other
too, even as much as we please: but at the same time we are busie in
this, it may be we are secret Adulterers, and that will spoil our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
in the goodness of the other instance: others are greatly boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
to the poor, and love all mankind, and hurt no body but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
but it is a thousand pities to see such loving good natured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to perish infinitely by one crime, and to see such excellent good
things thrown away to please an uncontrolled and a stubborn lust; but
so do some escape out of a pit, and are taken in a trap at their going
forth; and stepping aside to avoid the hoar Frost, fall into a Valley full
of Snow. The Righteousness Evangelical is another kind of thing: it
is a holy Conversation, a God-like life, an Universal Obedience, a keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56643:11"/>
nothing back from God, a Sanctification of the whole man, and
keeps not the Body only, but the Soul and the Spirit unblamable to the
coming of the Lord Jesus.</p>
                  <p>5. And lastly; The Pharisaical Righteousness was the product of fear,
and therefore what they must needs do, that they would do; but no more:
But the Righteousness Evangelical is produced by Love, it is managed
by Choice, and cherished by Delight and fair Experiences. Christians are
a willing people; <hi>homines bonae voluntatis,</hi> men of good will; <hi>arbores
Domini.</hi> So they are mystically represented in Scripture; <hi>the Trees of
the Lord are full of Sap:</hi> among the Hebrews the Trees of the Lord did
signifie such trees as grew of themselves, and all that are of Gods plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
are such as have a vital principal within, and grow without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, one said
it of Christians; they obey the Laws, and by the goodness of their
lives exceed the Laws; and certain it is, no man hath the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
Evangelical if he resolves alwayes to take all his liberty in every
thing that is meerly lawful; or if he purpose to do no more than he
must needs, that is, no more than he is just commanded. For the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are plain.</p>
                  <p>1. The Christian that resolves to do every thing that is Lawful, will
many times run into danger and inconvenience; because the utmost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of Lawful is so near to that which is Unlawful, that he will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
pass into Unlawful undiscernably. Vertues and Vices have not in all
their instances a great Land-mark set between them, like warlike Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
separate by prodigious Walls, vast Seas, and portentous Hills;
but they are oftentimes like the bounds of a Parish; men are fain
to cut a cross upon the turf, and make little marks and annual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulations
for memorials: so it is in Lawful and Unlawful, by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
mistake a man may be greatly ruined. He that drinks till his
tongue is full as a spunge, and his speech a little stammering and
tripping, hasty and disorderly, though he be not gone as far as drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
yet he is gone beyond the severity of a Christian; and when he is
just past into Unlawful, if he disputes too curiously he will certainly
deceive himself for want of a wiser curiosity.</p>
                  <p>But 2. He that will do all that he thinks he may lawfully, had need
have an infallible guide always by him, who should without error be
able to answer all cases of Conscience, which will happen every day
in a life so careless and insecure; for if he should be mistaken, his error is his
crime, and not his excuse. A man in this case had need be very sure of
his Proposition; which because he cannot be, in charity to himself he
will quickly find that he is bound to abstain from all things that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly
good, and from all disputable evils, from things which although
they may be in themselves lawful, yet accidentally, and that from a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
causes may become unlawful. <hi>Pavidus quippe &amp; formidolosus est
Christianus,</hi> saith <hi>Salvian,—atque in tantum peccare metuens, ut inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
&amp; non timenda formidet.</hi> A Christian is afraid of every little thing:
and he sometimes greatly fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that he hath sinned, even then when he
hath no other reason to be afraid, but because he would not do so for all
the world.</p>
                  <p>3. He that resolves to use all his liberty cannot be innocent, so
long as there are in the world so many bold temptations, and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
actions, so many scandals, and so much ignorance in the things of
God, so many things that are suspicious, and so many things that are of
evil report; so many ill customs and disguises in the world, with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56643:12"/>
which if we resolve to comply in all that is supposed lawful, a man may
be in the regions of death, before he perceive his head to ake; and
instead of a staff in his hand, may have a splinter in his Elbow.</p>
                  <p>4. Besides all this; he that thus stands on his terms with God, and so
carefully husbands his duty, and thinks to make so good a market of
obedience, that he will quit nothing which he thinks he may lawfully
keep, shall never be exemplar in his life, and shall never grow in grace,
and therefore shall never enter into glory. He therefore that will be
righteous by the measures Evangelical, must consider not only what is
lawful, but what is expedient; not only what is barely safe, but what
is worthy, that which may secure, and that which may do advantage
to that concern that is the greatest in the world.</p>
                  <p>And 2. The case is very like with them that resolve to do no more
good than is commanded them. For 1. It is infinitely unprofitable as to
our eternal interest, because no man does do all that is commanded at
all times; and therefore he that will not sometimes do more, besides
that he hath no love, no zeal of duty, no holy fires in his soul; besides
this, I say, he can never make any amends towards the reparation of his
Conscience. <hi>Let him that stole steal no more;</hi> that's well; but that's
not well enough, for he must, if he can, make restitution of what he
stole, or he shall never be pardoned; and so it is in all our entercourse
with God. To do what is commanded is the duty of the present; we
are tyed to this in every present, in every period of our lives; but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we never do any more than just the present duty, who shall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the dificiencies, and fill up the gaps, and redeem what is past? This
is a material consideration in the Righteousness Evangelical.</p>
                  <p>But then 2. We must know that in keeping of Gods Commandments
every degree of internal duty is under the Commandments; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatever we do, we must do it is as well as we can. Now he that
does his Duty with the biggest affection he can, will also do all that
he can; and he can never know that he hath done what is commanded,
unless he does all that is in his power. For God hath put no limit but
love and possibility, and therefore whoever says, Hither will I go and
no further, This I will do and no more, Thus much will I serve God,
but that shall be all; he hath the affections of a Slave, and the religion
of a Pharisee, the craft of a Merchant, and the falseness of a Broker;
but he hath not the proper measures of the Righteousness Evangelical. But
so it happens in the mud and slime of the River <hi>Borborus,</hi> when the eye
of the Sun hath long dwelt upon it, and produces Frogs and Mice which
begin to move a little under a thin cover of its own parental matter,
and if they can get loose to live half a life, that is all; but the hinder
parts, which are not formed before the setting of the Sun, stick fast in
their beds of mud, and the little moyety of a creature dies before it
could be well said to live: so it is with those Christians, who will do
all that they think lawful, and will do no more than what they
suppose necessary; they do but peep into the light of the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;
they have the beginnings of life; but their hinder parts, their
passions and affections, and the desires of the lower man are still unform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and he that dwells in this state is just so much of a Christian as a
Spunge is of a plant, and a mushrom of a shrub: they may be as sensible
as an oyster, and discourse at the rate of a child, but are greatly short of
the Righteousness Evangelical.</p>
                  <p>I have now done with those parts of the Christian Righteousness, which
were not only an <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or excess, but an <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to the Pharisaical:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56643:12"/>
but because I ought not to conceal any thing from you that must inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
our duty, and secure our title to the Kingdom of Heaven; there
is this to be added, that this precept of our blessed Saviour is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the direct degrees of our duty. We must do more duties,
and we must do them better. And in this, although we can have no posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
measures, because they are potentially infinite, yet therefore we
ought to take the best, because we are sure the greatest is not too big;
and we are not sure that God will accept a worse, when we can do a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Now although this is to be understood of the internal affection
only; because that must never be abated, but God is at all times to be
loved and served with all our heart, yet concerning the degrees of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
duty, as Prayers, and Alms, and the like, we are certainly tyed
to a greater excellency in the degree, than was that of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Pharisees.</hi> I am obliged to speak one word for the determination of this
inquiry, <hi>viz.</hi> to how much more of external duty Christians are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than was in the righteousness of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees.</hi> In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to this, briefly thus.</p>
                  <p>I remember that <hi>Salvian</hi> speaking of old men summing up their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentances,
and making amends for the sins of their whole life, exhorts
them to Alms and works of Piety. But inquiring how much they should
do towards the redeeming of their Souls, answers with a little Sarcasm,
but plainly enough to give a wise man an answer. <hi rend="margQuotes">A man, sayes he, is
not bound to give away all his goods, unless peradventure he owes all
to God; but in that case I cannot tell what to say; for then the case
is altered. A man is not bound to part with all his estate; that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
his sins be greater than his estate; but if they be, then he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of it again, and consider better. And he need not part with it
all, unless pardon be more precious to him than his money, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Heaven be worth it all, and unless he knows justly how much less
will do it. If he does let him try his skill, and pay just so much and
no more than he owes to God: but if he does not know, let him be
sure to do enough.</hi> His meaning is this: Not that a man is bound to
give all he hath, and leave his children beggars; he is bound from that
by another obligation. But as when we are tyed to pray continually,
the meaning is, we should consecrate all our time by taking good porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of all our time for that duty; the devoutest person being like the
waters of <hi>Siloam,</hi> a perpetual Spring, but not a perpetual Current;<note place="margin">S. Hier. in comment. Isai. 8. Isidor. l. 13. Orig. cap. 13.</note>
that is alwayes in readiness, but actually thrusting forth his waters
at certain periods every day. So out of all our estate we must take
for Religion and Repentance such portions as the whole estate can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
so much as will consecrate the rest; so much as is fit to bring when
we pray for a great pardon, and deprecate a mighty anger, and turn
aside an intolerable fear, and will purchase an excellent peace, and will
reconcile a sinner. Now in this case a Christian is to take his measures
according to the rate of his contrition and his love, his Religion and his
fear, his danger and his expectation, and let him measure his amends wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
his sorrow pouring in, and his fear thrusting it down, and it were
very well, if his love also would make it run over. For deceive not
your selves, there is no other measure but this; So much good as a man
does, or so much as he would do, if he could, so much of Religion and so
much of repentance he hath, and no more: and a man cannot ordinarily
know that he is in a saveable condition, but by the Testimony which
a Divine Philanthropy and a good mind alwaies gives, which is to omit
no opportunity of doing good in our several proportions and possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>

There was an Alms which the Scribes and Pharisees were obliged by

in iis quae praeter jus.</hi> It is more than righteousness, it is bounty and

had any time left; but I can only name it, and desire your consideration
to make it up. This great Rule that Christ gives us, does also, and that
principally too, concern Churches and Common-wealths, as well as
every single Christian. Christian Parliaments must exceed the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

of Christ must be strictly enforced, you must not suffer your great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

by impiety: you must give no impunity to vitious persons, and
you must take care that no great example be greatly corrupted; you
must make better provisions for your poor than they did, and take
more care even of the external advantages of Christs Religion and his
Ministers, than they did of the Priests and Levites; that is, in all
things you must be more zealous to promote the Kingdom of Christ,
than they were for the Ministeries of <hi>Moses.</hi>

no Christian is a wicked man, unless his life be a continual lie,

no argument or sanction of laws; and the greatest good in the world
is not considerable, and the greatest evil is not formidable; but if they
be, there is no more to be said; if you would have your portion with
Christ, you must be righteous by his measures; and these are they that

Does S. <hi>Paul</hi> mean this of himself, or of some other?
It is hoped that he speaks it of himself; and means that though his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is convinced that he ought to serve God; and that he hath
some unperfect desires to do so; yet the Law of God without is opposed
by a Law of Sin within. We have a corrupted nature, and a body of
infirmity, and our reason dwells in the dark, and we must go out of the
world before we leave our sin. For besides that some sins are esteemed
brave and honourable, and he is a baffled person that dares not kill his
Brother like a Gentleman; our very Tables are made a snare, and our
civilities are direct treasons to the soul. You cannot entertain your
friend but excess is the measure; and that you may be very kind to your
Guest, you step aside and lay away the Christian; your love cannot be
expressed unless you do him an ill turn, and civilly invite him to a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Justice is too often taught to bow to great interests, and men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live without flattery; and there are some Trades that minister to
sin, so that without a sin we cannot maintain our Families; and if you
mean to live, you must do as others do. Now so long as men see they
are like to be undone by innocence, and that they can no way live but
by compliance with the evil customs of the world, men conclude pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically,
because they must live they must sin; they must live hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly,
and therefore must do some things unhandsomely, and so upon
the whole matter sin is unavoidable. Fain they would, but cannot tell
how to help it. But since it is no better, it is well it is no worse. For
it is S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s case, no worse man; he would and he would not, he did
and he did not; he was willing, but he was not able; and therefore
the case is clear, that if a man strives against sin, and falls unwillingly,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56643:15"/>
it shall not be imputed to him; he may be a regenerate man for all that.
A man must indeed wrangle against sin when it comes, and like a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
lover resist and consent at the same time, and then all is well; for
this not only consists with, but is a sign of the state of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>If this be true, God will be very ill served. If it be not true, most
men will have but small hopes of being saved, because this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of most men. What then is to be done? Truth can do us no
hurt, and therefore be willing to let this matter pass under examination;
for if it trouble us now, it will bring comfort hereafter. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
before I enter into the main enquiry, I shall by describing the state
of the man of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks here, tell you plainly, who it is
that is in this state of sad things, and then do ye make your resolutions
according as you shall find it necessary for the saving of your souls;
which I am sure ought to be the end of all preaching.</p>
                  <p>1. The man S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of is one that is <hi>dead,</hi> v. 9. one that was
<hi>deceived</hi> and <hi>slain,</hi> v. 11. one in whom <hi>sin was exceeding sinful,</hi> v. 13.
that is, highly imputed, greatly malicious, infinitely destructive: he is
one who is <hi>carnal, and sold under sin,</hi> v. 14. he is one that sins against his
<hi>conscience</hi> and his <hi>reason,</hi> v. 16. he is one in whom <hi>sin dwells,</hi> but the
Spirit of God does not dwell; for <hi>no good thing dwells in him,</hi> v. 18.
he is one who is <hi>brought into captivity to the law of sin,</hi> he is a servant of
uncleanness, with his flesh and members serving the law of sin, v. 25.
Now if this be a state of Regeneration, I wonder what is, or can be a
state of Reprobation! for though this be the state of Nature, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the state of one redeemed by the Spirit of Christ; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
flatter not your selves any more, that it is enough for you to have
good desires, and bad performances: never think that any sin can reign
in you, and yet you be servants of God: that sin can dwell in you,
and at the same time the Spirit of God can dwell in you too; or that
life and death can abide together. The sum of affairs is this. <hi>If ye
live after the flesh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>ye shall dye; but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the
deeds of the body, ye shall live,</hi> but not else upon any terms what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
                  <p>My Text is one of the hard places of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> which, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> says,
<hi>the ignorant and the unstable wrest to their own damnation.</hi> But because
in this case the danger is so imminent, and the deception would be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
S. <hi>Paul</hi> immediately after this Chapter (in which under his
own person, as was usual with him to do, he describes the state of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
man advanced no further than <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and not redeemed by the
blood of Christ, or inlightned by the Spirit of God, and taught by the
wiser Lessons and Sermons of the Gospel) immediately spends the next
Chapter in opposing the Evangelical state to the Legal, the Spiritual to
the Carnal, the Christian to the Natural; and tells us plainly, he that is
redeemed by the blood of Christ, is redeemed from the power of sin:
he that is Christs freed man, is not a slave of sin, not captive to the Devil
at his will: he that is in <hi>the flesh cannot please God,</hi> but every servant
of Christ is freed from sin, and is a servant of righteousness, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
from all his vain conversation: for this is the end of Christs
coming, and cannot be in vain unless we make it so. He came to bless us
by turning every one of us from our iniquities. Now concerning this,
besides the evidence of the thing it self, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> does not speak these
words of himself, but by a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, under his own borrowed
person he describes the state of a carnal, unredeemed, unregenerate
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56643:15"/>
person, is expresly affirmed by S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and
S. <hi>Basil,</hi> by <hi>Theodoret</hi> and S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> by S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and sometimes by
S. <hi>Austin,</hi> by S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> by <hi>Macarius</hi> and <hi>Theophylact;</hi> and
is indeed that true sense and meaning of these words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which
words none can abuse or misunderstand, but to the great prejudice of a
holy life, and the Patronage of all iniquity.</p>
                  <p>But for the stating of this great case of Conscience, I shall first in short
describe to you what are the proper causes which place men, and keep
them in this state of a necessity of sinning; and 2. I shall prove the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
necessity of coming out of this condition, and quitting all our
sin. 3. In what degree this is to be affected. 4. By what Instruments
this is to be done; and all these being practical, will of themselves be
sufficient use to the Doctrines, and need no other applicatory but a plain
exhortation.</p>
                  <p>1. What are the causes of this evil, by which we are first placed,
and so long kept in a necessity of sinning, so that we cannot do what
good we would, nor avoid the evil that we hate?</p>
                  <p>The first is the evil state of our Nature. And indeed he that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the daily experiment of his own weak Nature, the ignorance and
inconstancy of his soul, being like a sick mans legs, or the knees of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
reeling and unstable by disease or by infirmity, and the perpetual
leaven and germinations, the thrustings forth, and swelling of his senses,
running out like new wine into vapours and intoxicating activities, will
readily confess, that though even in Nature there may be many good
inclinations to many instances of the Divine Commandments; yet it
can go no further than this <hi>velleity,</hi> this desiring to do good, but is not
able. And it is upon this account that <hi>Lactantius</hi> brings in the Pagan
or natural man complaining, <hi>Volo equidem non peccare, sed vincor, indutus
enim sum carne fragili &amp; imbecillâ.</hi> This is very true; and I add only
this caution. There is not in the corruption of our nature so much as
will save us harmless, or make us excusable if we sin against God. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
corruption can make us criminal, but not innocent; for though
by him that willingly abides in the state of meer Nature, sin cannot be
avoided, yet no man is in that state longer than he loves to be so; for
the Grace of God came to rescue us from this evil portion, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
present to give us a new Nature, and create us over again: and
therefore though sin is made necessary to the Natural man by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
and fond loves, that is by his unregenerate Nature; yet in the
whole constitution of affairs, God hath more than made it up by his
Grace, if we will make use of it. <hi>In pueris elucet spes plurimorum, quae
ubi emoritur aetate, manifestum est non deficisse naturam, sed curam,</hi> said
<hi>Quintilian.</hi> We cannot tell what we are, or what we think in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy;
and when we can know our thoughts we can easily observe
that we have learned evil things by evil examples, and the corrupt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of an evil conversation: <hi>&amp; ubi per socordiam vires, tempus, ingenium
defluxêer, naturae infirmitas accusatur;</hi> that indeed is too true; we grow
lazy, and wanton, and we lose our time, and abuse our parts, and do
ugly things, and lay the fault wholly upon our Natural infirmities; but
we must remember that by this time it is a state of Nature, a state of
flesh and blood, which cannot enter into Heaven. The natural man
and the natural child are not the same thing in true Divinity. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
child indeed can do no good; but the Natural man cannot choose
but do evil; but it is because he will do so; he is not born in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Birth, and renewed in the Baptism of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:56643:16"/>
2. We have brought our selves into an accidental necessity of sinn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the evil principles which are suck'd in by great parts of mankind.
We are taught ways of going to Heaven without forsaking our sins;
of repentance without restitution; of being in charity without
hearty forgiveness, and without love; of believing our sins to
be pardoned before they are mortified; of trusting in Christs
death without conformity to his life; of being in Gods favour
upon the only account of being of such an opinion; and that when
we are once in, we can never be out. We are taught to believe
that the events of things do not depend upon our crucifying our evil
and corrupt affections, but upon eternal and unalterable Counsels;
that the promises are not the rewards of obedience, but graces
pertaining only to a few praedestinates, and yet men are Saints for all
that; and that the Laws of God are of the race of the Giants, not
to be observed by any grace or by any industry: this is the Catechism
of the ignorant and the prophane: but without all peradventure the
contrary propositions are the way to make the world better: but
certainly they that believe these things do not believe it necessary that
we should eschew all evil: and no wonder then if when men upon
these accounts slacken their industry and their care, find sin still prevailing,
still dwelling within them, and still unconquerable by so slight and
disheartned labours. For <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fool and every ignorant person is a child still; and it is no wonder
that he who talks foolishly should do childishly and weakly.</p>
                  <p>3. To our weak and corrupted nature, and our foolish discourses,
men do dayly superinduce evil habits and customs of sinning. <hi>Consuetudo
mala tanquam hamus infixus animae,</hi> said the Father; an evil custom is
a hook in the soul, and draws it whither the Devil pleases. When
it comes to the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s word is, <hi>a heart
exercised with covetous practices,</hi> then it is also <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it is weak and unable
to do the good it fain would, or to avoid the evil which in a good
fit it pretends to hate. This is so known I shall not insist upon it; but
adde this only, that wherever a habit is contracted, it is all one what
the instance be; it is as easie as delicious, as unalterable in vertue as
in vice; for what helps Nature brings to a vitious habit, the same
and much more the Spirit of God, by his power and by his comforts
can do in a vertuous; and then we are well again. You see by this
who are, and why they are in this evil condition. The evil natures,
and the evil principles, and the evil manners of the world, these are
the causes of our imperfect willings, and weaker actings in the things
of God; and as long as men stay here, sin will be unavoidable. For
even meat it self is loathsom to a sick stomack; and it is impossible
for him that is heart-sick to eat the most wholsom diet; and
yet he that shall say eating is impossible, will be best confut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by seeing all the healthful men in the world eat heartily
every day.</p>
                  <p>2. But what then? Cannot sin be avoided? Cannot a Christian
mortifie the deeds of the body? Cannot Christ redeem us, and cleanse
us from all our sins? Cannot the works of the Devil be destroyed?
That's the next particular to be inquired of; Whether or not it be not
necessary, and therefore very possible for a servant of God to pass from
this evil state of things, and not only hate evil, but avoid it also?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that saith he hath not sinned, is a liar;</hi> but what then? Because a
man hath sinned, it does not follow he must do so always. <hi>Hast thou sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56643:16"/>
do so no more</hi> (said the wise <hi>Bensirach</hi>); and so said Christ to the
poor Paralytick, <hi>Go and sin no more.</hi> They were excellent words spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by a holy Prophet, <hi>[Let not the Sinner say he hath not sinned; for
God shall burn coals of fire upon his head, that saith before the Lord God
and his Glory, I have not sinned.]</hi> Well! that case is confessed; <hi>All men
have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.</hi> But is there no remedy
for this? Must it always be so? and must sin for ever have the upper
hand, and for ever baffle our resolutions, and all our fierce and earnest
promises of amendment? God forbid. There was a time then to come,
and, blessed be God, it hath been long come, [<hi>Yet a little while</hi> (saith that
Prophet) <hi>and Iniquity shall be taken out of the earth, and Righteousness
shall reign among you.</hi>] For, that's in the day of Christ's Kingdom, the
manifestation of the Gospel. When Christ reigns in our hearts by his
Spirit, <hi>Dagon</hi> and the Ark cannot stand together; we cannot serve
Christ and <hi>Belial.</hi> And as in the state of Nature no good thing dwells
within us; so when Christ rules in us, no evil thing can abide; <hi>For every
Plant that my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up,</hi> and
cast away into the fires of consumption or purification. But how shall
this come to pass, since we all find our selves so infinitely weak and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish?
I shall tell you. <hi>It is easier for a Camel to go through the eye of a
Needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> saith
Christ. It is impossible to Nature; it is impossible to them that are given
to vanity; it is impossible for them that delight in the evil snare: But
Christ adds, <hi>With Men this is impossible, but with God all things are possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
What we cannot do for our selves, God can do for us, and with us.
What Nature cannot do, the Grace of God can. So that the thing may
be done, not indeed by our selves, but <hi>gratia Dei mecum,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul;</hi>
God and Man together can do it. But if it can be done any way that
God has put into our powers, the consequent is this; No mans good
will shall be taken in exchange for the real and actual mortification of
his sins. He that sins, and would fain not sin, but sin is present with him
whether he will or no, let him take heed; for the same is <hi>the Law of sin,</hi>
and <hi>the Law of death</hi> (saith the Apostle); and that mans heart is not
right with God. For it is impossible men should pray for deliverance,
and not be heard; that they should labour, and not be prosperous; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they pray amiss, and labour falsely. Let no man therefore please
himself with talking of great things, with perpetual conversation in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
discourses, or with ineffective desires of serving God: He that does
not practice as well as he talks, and do what he desires, and what he ought
to do, confesses himself to sin greatly against his conscience; and it is a
prodigious folly to think that he is a good man, because though he does
sin, yet it was against his mind to do so. A mans conscience can never
condemn him, if that be his excuse, to say that his conscience check'd
him; ad that will be but a sad Apology at the day of Judgement. Some
men talk like Angels, and pray with great fervor, and meditate with
deep recesses, and speak to God with loving affections, and words of
union, and adhere to him in silent devotion, and when they go abroad
are as passionate as ever, peevish as a frighted Fly, vexing themselves
with their own reflections: They are cruel in their Bargains, unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to their Tenants, and proud as a Barbarian Prince: They are, for all
their fine words, impatient of reproof, scornful to their Neighbours,
lovers of money, supream in their own thoughts, and submit to none;
all their spiritual life they talk of, is nothing but spiritual fancy and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
they are still under the power of their passions, and their sin rules
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56643:17"/>
them imperiously, and carries them away infallibly. Let these men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
There are some men think it impossible to do as much as they do:
The common Swearer cannot leave that Vice, and talk well; and these
men that talk thus well, think they cannot do as well as they talk; but
both of them are equally under the power of their respective sins, and
are equally deceived, and equally not the Servants of God. * This is
true; but it is equally as true, That there is no necessity for all this; for
it ought, and it may be otherwise if we please: For I pray be pleased to
hear S. <hi>Paul; Walk in the Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the
flesh;</hi> There's your remedy: <hi>For the Spirit lusteth against the flesh, and
the flesh against the Spirit;</hi> there's the cause of it; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>so that ye
may not or cannot do the things ye would;</hi> that's the blessed consequent
and product of that cause: That is plainly, As there is a state of carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
(of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in my Text) so that in that state a man
cannot but obey the flesh; so there is also a state of spirituality, when sin
is dead, and righteousness is alive; and in this state the flesh can no more
prevail, than the Spirit could do in the other. * Some men cannot chuse
but sin;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> for <hi>the carnal mind is not subject to God, neither indeed can be</hi>
(saith S. <hi>Paul</hi>); but there are also some men that cannot endure any thing
that is not good. It is a great pain for a temperate man to suffer the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of Drunkenness; and the shames of Lust are intolerable to a
chaste and modest person: This also is affirmed by S. <hi>John,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Whosoever is
born of God doth not commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him.</hi> So that
you see it is possible for a good man not to commit the sin to which he
is tempted; but the Apostle says more, <hi>He doth not commit sin, neither
indeed can he, because he is born of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is agreeable to the words of our Blessed Saviour; <hi>A corrupt
tree cannot bring forth good fruit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>and a good tree cannot bring forth
evil fruit;</hi> that is; As the child of Hell is carried to Sin <hi>pleno impetu,</hi>
he does not check at it, he does it and is not troubled; so on the other
side, a child of God is as fully convinc'd of righteousness, and that which
is unrighteous is as hateful to him as <hi>Colocynths</hi> to the taste, or the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
punctures to the pupil of the eye. We may see something of this in
common experiences. What man of ordinary prudence and reputation
can be tempted to steal? or for what price would he be tempted to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his friend? If we did hate all sins as we hate these, would it not be
as easie to be as innocent in other instances as most men are in these? and
we should have as few Drunkards as we have Thieves. In such as these
we do not complain in the words of my Text, <hi>What I would not, that I
do; and what I would I do not.</hi> Does not every good man overcome all
the power of great sins? And can he by the Spirit of God and right
Reason, by fear and hope conquer <hi>Goliath,</hi> and beat the Sons of the
Giant; and can he not overcome the little children of <hi>Gath?</hi> Or is it
harder to overcome a little sin than a great one? Are not the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to little sins very little? and yet are they greater and stronger than
a mighty Grace? Could the poor Demoniack that liv'd in the Graves,
by the power of the Devil break his iron chains in pieces? and cannot he
who hath the Spirit of God dissolve the chains of sin? <hi>Through Christ that
strengthens me, I can do all things,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul: Satis sibi copiarum cum
Publio Decio, &amp; nunquam nimium hostium fore,</hi> said one in <hi>Livie;</hi> which

signifies the sin that is so easily avoided, as they that understand that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
know very well. And if we were so wise and valiant as not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
our selves with our own terrours, we should quickly find, that by
the help of the Spirit of God we can do more than we thought we could.
It was said of <hi>Alexander, Bene ausus est vana contemnere,</hi> he did no great
matter in conquering the Persians, because they were a pitiful and a soft
people; only he understood them to be so, and was wise and bold
enough not to fear such Images and men of clouts. But men, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of great sins and little, do as the <hi>Magicians</hi> of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> when <hi>Moses</hi>
turned his Rod into a Serpent, it moved them not; but when they saw
the Lice and the Flies, then they were afraid. We see that by the
Grace of God we can escape great sins; but we start at Flies, and a
Bird out of a Bush disorders us; the Lion in the way troubles us not,
but a Frog and a Worm affrights us. Remember the saying of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <hi>Christ came to redeem to himself a Church, and to present it pure and spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
before the Throne of Grace;</hi> and if you mean to be of this number, you
must endeavour to be under this qualification, that is, (as <hi>Paul</hi> laboured
to be) <hi>void of offence both towards God and towards Man.</hi> And so I have
done with the second Proposition; It is necessary that all sin great and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
should be mortified and dead in us, and that we no longer abide in that
state of slavery as to say, <hi>The good that I would, I do not; but the evil
that I would not, that I do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. In the next place we are to inquire in what degree this is to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
for though in negatives properly there are no degrees, yet unless
there be some allays in this Doctrine it will not be so well, and it may be
your Experiences will for ever confute my Arguments: For, <hi>Who
can say that he is clean from his sin?</hi> (said the Wiseman): and as our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour said, <hi>He that is innocent among you all, let him throw the first
stone at the sinner,</hi> and spare not.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer in the words of S. <hi>Gregory;</hi> All mans righteousness will
be found to be unrighteous, if God should severely enter into judgment;
but therefore even after our innocence we must pray for pardon, <hi>ut quae
succumbere discussa poterat, ex judicis pietate convalescat,</hi> that our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
which in strictness of Divine Judgment would be found spotted
and stained, by the mercy of our Saviour may be accepted. S. <hi>Bernard</hi>
expresses this well; <hi>Nostra siqua est humilis justitia, recta forsitan sed non
pura;</hi> Our humble righteousness is perhaps right in the eyes of God, but
not pure; that is, accepted by his Mercy, but it is such as dares not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
in Judgment. For as no man is so much a sinner, but he sometimes
speaks a good word, or does some things not ill; and yet that little good
interrupts not that state of evil: so it is amongst very good men, from
whom sometimes may pass something that is not commendable; and yet
their heart is so habitually right towards God, that they will do nothing
but (I do not say which God in justice cannot, but) which in mercy he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56643:18"/>
will not impute to eternal condemnation. It was the case of <hi>David; He
was a man after Gods own heart;</hi> nay it is said, <hi>he was blameless save
in the matter of</hi> Uriah; and yet we know he numbred the people, and
God was angry with him and punished him for it: but because he was a
good man and served God heartily, that other fault of his was imputed
to him no further: God set a fine upon his head for it, but it was <hi>salvo
contenemento,</hi> the main stake was safe.</p>
                  <p>For concerning good men the question is not, whether or no God could
not in the rigour of justice blame their indiscretion, or impute a
foolish word, or chide them for a hasty answer, or a careless action, for
a less devout prayer, or weak hands, for a fearful heart, or a trembling
Faith. These are not the measures by which God judges his Children;
<hi>for he knoweth whereof we are made, and he remembers that we are
but dust.</hi> But the question is, whether any man that is covetous or
proud, false to his trust, or a Drunkard, can at the same time be a child
of God? No certainly he cannot. But then we know that God judges
us by Jesus Christ, that is, with the allayes of mercy, with an eye of
pardon, with the sentences of a Father, by the measures of a man, and
by analogy to all our unavoidable abatements. God could enter with
us into a more severe judgment, but he would not; and no justice tied
him from exercising that mercy. But according to the measures of the
Gospel, <hi>he will judge every man according to his works.</hi> Now what
these measures are is now the question. To which I answer first in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and then more particularly.</p>
                  <p>1. In general thus. A Christians innocence is alwayes to be measured
by the plain lines and measures of the Commandments; but are not to
be taken into account by uncertain and fond opinions, and the scruples
of zealous and timerous persons. My meaning is this. Some men tell
us that every natural inclination to a forbidden object is a sin; which
they that believe, finding them to be natural, do also confess that such
sins are unavoidable. But if these natural and first motions be sins, then
a man sins whether he resists them, or resists them not, whether he prevails
or prevails not; and there is no other difference but this; he that fights
not against, but alwayes yields to his desires, sins greatest; and he that
never yields but fights alwayes, sins oftenest. But then, by this reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it will indeed be impossible to avoid millions of sins; because the
very doing of our duty does suppose a sin. If God should impute such
first desires to us as sins, we were all very miserable; but if he does not
impute them, let us trouble our selves no further about them, but to
take care that they never prevail upon us. Thus men are taught that they
never say their Prayers but they commit a sin. Indeed that is true but too
often; but yet it is possible for us by the Grace of God to please him in
saying our Prayers, and to be accepted of him. But indeed if God
did proceed against us as we do against one another, no man could abide
innocent for so much as one hour. But Gods judgment is otherwise:
He enquires if the heart be right, if our labour be true, if we love no
sin, if we use prudent and efficacious instruments to mortifie our sin, if
we go about our Religion as we go about the biggest concerns of our life;
if we be sincere and real in our actions and intentions. For this is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that God requires of us all; this is that sinless state, in which
if God does not find us, we shall never see his glorious face, and if he
does find us, we shall certainly be saved by the blood of Jesus. For in
the style of Scripture to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the same thing; to be
sincere, and to be without offence is all one. Thus <hi>David</hi> spake hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56643:18"/>
                     <hi>I am utterly purposed that my mouth shall not offend; and thou shalt
find no wickedness in me.</hi> He that endeavours this, and hopes this, and
does actions, and uses means accordingly, not being deceived by his
own false heart, nor abused by evil propositions, this man will stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in the Congregations of the Just; and though he cannot challenge
Heaven by merit, yet he shall receive it as a gift, by promise and by
grace. <hi>Lex nos innocentes esse jubet, non curiosos,</hi> said <hi>Seneca.</hi> For
God takes no judgment of us by any measures, but of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without, and the heart and the conscience within; but he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his Laws to be a snare to us, or to entrap us with consequences
and dark interpretations, by large deductions and witty similitudes of
faults; but he requires of us a sincere heart, and a hearty labour in the
work of his Commandments: he calls upon us to avoid all that which
his Law plainly forbids, and which our Consciences do condemn. This
is the general measure. The particulars are briefly these.</p>
                  <p>1. Every Christian is bound to arrive at that state, that he have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in him no habit of any sin whatsoever. Our old man must be
crucified; the body of sin must be destroyed; he must no longer serve
sin; sin shall not have the dominion over you. All these are the Apostles
words; that is plainly, as I have already declared, you must not be at
that pass, that though ye would avoid sin ye cannot. For he that is so
is a most perfect slave, and Christs freed man cannot be so. Nay, he
that loves sin, and delights in it, hath no liberty indeed, but he hath
more shew of it, than he that obeys it against his will.

                        <l>Si quicquid jubeare velis—</l>
                     </q>
He that loves to be in the place, is a less prisoner, than he that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
against his will.</p>
                  <p>2. He that commits any one sin by choice and deliberation is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to God, and is under the dominion of the flesh. In the case of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
sins one act does give the denomination; he is an Adulterer that
so much as once foully breaks the holy Laws of Marriage. <hi>He that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
in one is guilty of all,</hi> saith S. <hi>James.</hi> S. <hi>Peters</hi> Denial, and <hi>Davids</hi>
Adultery had passed on to a fatal issue, if the mercy of God and a great
repentance had not interceded. But they did so no more, and so God
restored them to Grace and Pardon. And in this sense are the words
of S. <hi>John,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>he that does a sin is of the Devil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 8.</note> and <hi>he that
is born of God</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>he does not commit a sin,</hi> he chooses none, he
loves none, he endures none, <hi>talia quae non faciet bonae fidei &amp; spei
Christianus;</hi> they do no great sin, and love no little one. A sin chosen
and deliberately done, is, as <hi>Tertullians</hi> expression is, <hi>crimen devoràtorium
salutis;</hi> it devours salvation. For as there are some sins which can be
done but once; as a man can kill his Father but once, or himself but
once; so in those things which can be repeated, a perfect choice is
equivalent to a habit, it is the same in principle, that a habit is in the
product. In short he is not a child of God, that knowingly and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
chooses any thing that God hates.</p>
                  <p>3. Every Christian ought to attain to such a state of life, as that he
never sin, not only by a long deliberation, but also not by passion. I do
not say that he is not a good Christian, who by passion is suddenly
surpriz'd and falls into folly; but this I say, that no passion ought to
make him choose a sin. For let the sin enter by anger or by desire, it is
all one, if the consent be gain'd. It is an ill sign if a man, though on the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56643:19"/>
sudden, consents to a base action. Thus far every good man is tied,
not only to endeavour, but to prevail against his Sin.</p>
                  <p>4. There is one step more; which if it be not actually effected, it
must at least be greatly endeavoured, and the event be left to God:
and that is, that we strive for so great a dominion over our sins and lust, as
that we be not surprized on a sudden. This indeed is a work of time,
and it is well if it be ever done; but it must alwayes be endeavoured.
But in this particular, even good men are sometimes unprosperous.
S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> grew once into choler, and they past
too far, and lost more than their argument, they lost their reason, and
they lost their patience: and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> wished that S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> might
not die a Bishop; and he in a peevish exchange wished that <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
might never return to his Bishoprick; when they had forgotten their
foolish anger, God remembred it, and said <hi>Amen</hi> to both their cursed
speakings. Nay, there is yet a greater example of humane frailty; St.
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were very holy persons, but once in a heat they
were both to blame, they were peevish and parted company. This was
not very much: but God was so displeased, even for this little flye in
their Box of Oyntment, that their story sayes, they never saw one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
face again. These earnest emissions and transportations of passion
do sometime declare the weakness of good men; but that even here
we ought at least to endeavour to be more than Conquerors appears in
this, because God allows it not, and by punishing such follies does manifest
that he intends that we should get victory over our sudden passions, as
well as our natural lusts. And so I have done with the third inquiry, in
what degree God expects our innocence; and now I briefly come to the
last particular, which will make all the rest practicable; I am now to
tell you how all this can be effected, and how we shall get free from the
power and dominion of our sins.</p>
                  <p>4. The first great instruments is Faith. He that hath Faith like a grain
of Mustard-seed can remove Mountains; the Mountains of sin shall fall
flat at the feet of the Faithful man, and shall be removed into the sea, the
sea of Christs blood and penitential waters. <hi>Faith overcometh the
World,</hi> saith S. <hi>John;</hi> and <hi>walk in the spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lusts
of the flesh:</hi> there are two of our Enemies gone; the world and the flesh,
by Faith and the Spirit, by the Spirit of Faith; and as for the Devil,
<hi>put on the shield of Faith,</hi> and <hi>resist the Devil, and he will flee from you,</hi>
saith the Apostle; and the powers of sin seem insuperable to none, but
to them that have not Faith; we do not believe that God intends we
should do what he seems to require of us; or else we think that though
Gods grace abounds, yet sin must superabound, expresly against the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> or else we think that the evil spirit is stronger than the
good Spirit of God. Hear what St. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>My little children, ye are
of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>and have overcome the evil one; for the spirit that is in you is
greater than that which is in the world.</hi> Believest thou this? If you do,
I shall tell you what may be the event of it. When the Father of the
boy,<note place="margin">Mark. 9. 23.</note> possessed with the Devil, told his sad story to Christ, he said; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
if thou canst do any thing, I pray help me:</hi> Christ answered him,
<hi>If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</hi> N. B.
And therefore if you do believe this, go to your prayers, and go to your
guards, and go to your labour, and try what God will do for you. For
whatsoever things ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye shall receive
them, and ye shall have them. Now consider; Do not we every day
pray in the Divine Hymn called <hi>Te Deum, Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56643:19"/>
this day without sin?</hi> And in the Collect at morning prayer, <hi>[and grant
that this day we fall into no sin, neither run into any kind of danger, but
that all our doing may be ordered by thy governance, to do alwayes that
which is righteous in thy sight?]</hi> Have you any hope, or any faith when
you say that Prayer? And if you do your duty as you can, do you
think the failure will be on Gods part? Fear not that; if you can trust
in God, and do accordingly; <hi>though your sins were as scarlet, yet they
shall be as white as snow,</hi> and pure as the feet of the holy Lamb. Only
let us forsake all those weak propositions which cut the nerves of Faith,
and make it impossible for us to actuate all our good desires, or to come
out from the power of sin.</p>
                  <p>2. He that would be free from the slavery of sin, and the necessity
of sinning must alwayes watch. I, that's the point; but who can watch
alwayes? Why every good man can watch alwayes: and that we may
not be deceived in this, let us know, that the running away from a
temptation is a part of our watchfulness, and every good employment
is another great part of it, and a laying in provisions of Reason and
Religion before hand, is yet a third part of this watchfulness; and the
conversation of a Christian is a perpetual watchfulness; not a continual
thinking of that one, or those many things which may indanger us; but
it is a continual doing something directly or indirectly against sin. He
either prayes to God for his Spirit, or relies upon the Promises, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the Sacrament, or goes to his Bishop for Counsel and a Blessing,
or to his Priest for Religious Offices, or places himself at the feet of
good Men to hear their wise sayings, or calls for the Churches Prayers,
or does the duty of his calling, or actually resists Temptation, or fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
renews his holy Purposes, or fortifies himself by Vows, or
searches into his danger by a daily examination; so that in the whole
he is for ever upon his guards. * This duty and caution of a Christian is
like watching lest a man cut his finger. Wise men do not often cut
their fingers, and yet every day they use a knife; and a mans eye is a
tender thing, and every thing can do it wrong, and every thing can put
it out; yet because we love our eyes so well, in the midst of so many
dangers, by Gods providence and a prudent natural care, by winking
when any thing comes against them, and by turning aside when a blow
is offered, they are preserved so certainly, that not one man in ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
does by a stroak lose one of his eyes in all his life time. If we
would transplant our natural care to a spiritual caution, we might by
Gods grace be kept from losing our souls, as we are from losing our
eyes; and because a perpetual watchfulness is our great defence, and
the perpetual presence of Gods grace is our great security, and that this
Grace never leaves us, unless we leave it, and the precept of a dayly
watchfulness is a thing not only so reasonable, but so many easie wayes
to be performed, we see upon what terms we may be quit of our sins,
and more than Conquerors over all the Enemies and Impediments
of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>3. If you would be in the state of the <hi>Liberty of the Sons of God,</hi>
that is, that you may not be servants of sin in any instance; be sure
in the mortifications of sin, willingly or carelesly to leave no remains of
it, no nest-egg, no principles of it, no affections to it; if any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
it will prove to us as Manna to the sons of <hi>Israel</hi> on the second
day, <hi>it will breed worms and stink.</hi> Therefore labour against every part
of it, reject every proposition that gives it countenance; pray to God
against it all; and what then? Why then, <hi>Ask and you shall have</hi> (said
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56643:20"/>
Christ.) Nay, say some, it is true, you shall be heard; but in part
only; for God will leave some remains of sin within us, lest we should
become proud by being innocent. So vainly do men argue against
Gods goodness and their own blessings and Salvation, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
(as S. <hi>Basil</hi> sayes) they contrive witty
arts to undo themselves, being intangled in the periods of ignorant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputations.
But as to the thing it self, if by the remains of sin they
mean the propensities and natural inclinations to forbidden objects;
there is no question but they will remain in us so long as we bear our flesh
about us; and surely that is a great argument to make us humble. But
these are not the sins which God charges on his people. But if by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
we mean any part of the habit of sin, any affection, any malice
or perverseness of the Will; then it is a contradiction to say that God
leaves in us such remains of Sin, lest by innocence we become Proud:
for how should Pride spring in a mans heart, if there be no remains of Sin
left? And is it not the best, the surest way to cure the Pride of our
hearts, by taking out every root of bitterness, even the root of Pride it
self? Will a Physitian purposely leave the Reliques of a disease, and
pretend he does it to prevent a relapse? And is it not more likely he
will relapse, if the sickness be not wholly cured? *But besides this;
If God leaves any remains of Sin in us, what remains are they, and of
what sins? Does he leave the remains of Pride? If so; that were a
strange cure, to leave the remains of Pride in us to keep us from being
proud. But if not so; but that all the remains of Pride be taken away
by the grace of God blessing our endeavours; what danger is there of
being proud, the remains of which Sin are by the grace of God wholly
taken away? But then, if the Pride of the heart be cured, which is
the hardest to be removed, and commonly is done last of all, who can
distrust the power of the Spirit of God, or his goodness, or his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and say that God does not intend to cleanse his Sons and Servants
from all unrighteousness; and according to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer, <hi>keep their
bodies and souls, and spirits, unblameable to the coming of the Lord Jesus?</hi>
But however, let God leave what remains he please; all will be well
enough on that side, but let us be careful, as far as we can, that we leave
none; lest it be severely imputed to us, and the fire break out and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
us.</p>
                  <p>4. Let us without any further question, put this argument to a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
issue; let us do all that we can do towards the destruction of the
whole body of sin; but let us never say we cannot be quit of our Sin,
till we have done all that we can do towards the mortification of it. For
till that be done, how can any man tell where the fault lies, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it can be done or no? If any man can say that he hath done all that
he could do, and yet hath failed of his duty; if he can say truly, that
he hath endured as much as is possible to be endured, that he hath watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
alwayes, and never nodded, when he could avoid it, that he hath
loved as much as he could love, that he hath waited till he can wait no
longer; then indeed, if he sayes true, we must confess that it is not to
be understood. But is there any man in the World that does all that he
can do? If there be, that man is blameless; if there be not, then he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say but it is his own fault that his sin prevails against him. It is true,
that no man is free from sin; but it is as true, that no man does as much
as he can against it: and therefore no man must go about to excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by saying, no man is free from his sin; and therefore no man can be,
no not by the powers of grace: for he may as well argue thus; No man
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56643:20"/>
does do all that he can do against it; and therefore it is impossible he
should do what he can do. The argument is apparently foolish, and
the excuse is weak, and the deception visible, and sin prevails upon
our weak arguings; but the consequence is plainly this: When any
man commits a sin, he is guilty before God; and he cannot say he
could not help it, and God is just in punishing every sin, and very
merciful when he forgives us any: but he that says he cannot avoid
it, that he cannot overcome his lust, confesses himself a servant of
Sin, and that he is not yet redeemed by the blood of the Holy
Lamb.</p>
                  <p>5. He that would be advanced beyond the power and necessity of
of sinning must take great caution concerning his thoughts and secret
desires: <hi>For lust when it is conceived bringeth forth sin;</hi> but if it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the conception, it comes to nothing: but we find it hard to
destroy the Serpent when the egg is hatched into a Cockatrice. The
thought is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; no man takes notice of it, but lets it alone
till the sin be too strong, and then we complain we cannot
help it. <hi>Nolo sinas cogitationem orescere,</hi>

suddenly, and easily, and without business; but take heed that you nurse
them not; but if you chance to stumble, mend your pace; and if you
nod, let it awaken you; for he only can be a good man, that raises him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
up at the first trip, that strangles his sin in the birth: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
good men rise up again even before they fall, saith
S. <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> Now I pray consider, that when sin is but in the thought
it is easily suppressed; and if it be stopt there, it can go no further;
and what great mountain of labour is it then to abstain from our sin?
Is not the Adultery of the eye easily cured by shutting the eye-lid? and
cannot the thoughts of the heart be turned aside by doing business, by
going into company, by reading or by sleeping? A man may divert his
thoughts by shaking of his head, by thinking any else, by thinking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<hi>Da mihi Christianum</hi> (saith S. <hi>Austin) &amp; intelligit quod dico.</hi>
Every man that loves God understands this, and more than this to be
true. Now if things be thus, and that we may be safe in that which is
supposed to be the hardest of all, we must needs condemn our selves,
and lay our faces in the dust when we give up our selves to any sin; we
cannot be justified by saying we could not help it. For, as it was decreed
by the Fathers of the <hi>Aurasican</hi> Council 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>Hoc etiam secundum fidem
Catholicam credimus, &amp;c.</hi> This we believe according to the Catholick
Faith, that have received Baptismal Grace; all that are baptized by the
aid and cooperation of Christ, must and can (if they will labour faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully)
perform and fulfill those things which belong unto salvation.</p>
                  <p>6. And lastly, If sin hath gotten the power of any one of us, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in what degree the sin hath prevailed: If but a little, the battel will
be more easie, and the victory more certain; but then be sure to do it
throughly, because there is not much to be done: But if sin hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
greatly, then indeed you have very much to do, therefore begin
betimes, and defer not this work till old age shall make it extremely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,

age, thou shalt never overtake that strength; the hinder wheel,
though bigger than the former, and measures more ground at every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
yet shall never overtake it; and all the second counsels of thy
old age, though undertaken with greater resolution, and acted with
the strengths of fear and need, and pursued with more pertinacious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
than the early repentances of young men, yet shall never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
those advantages which you lost when you gave your youth to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the causes of a sad repentance.</p>
                  <p>However if you find it so hard a thing to get from the power of one
master-sin; if an old Adulterer does dote, if an old Drunkard be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from remedy than a young sinner, if Covetousness grows with old
age, if ambition be still more Hydropick and grows more thirsty for
every draught of Honour, you may easily resolve that old age, or your
last sickness is not so likely to be prosperous in the mortification of your
long prevailing sins. Do not all men desire to end their dayes in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to dye in the arms of the Church, to expire under the conduct of
a religious man? when ye are sick or dying, then nothing but prayers
and sad complaints, and the groans of a tremulous repentance, and the
faint labours of an almost impossible mortification: then the despised
Priest is sent for: then he is a good man, and his words are Oracles,
and Religion is truth, and sin is a load, and the sinner is a fool: then we
watch for a word of comfort from his mouth, as the fearful Prisoner for
his fate upon the Judges answer. That which is true then, is true now;
and therefore to prevent so intollerable a danger, mortifie your sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
for else you will hardly mortifie it at all. Remember that the
Snail out-went the Eagle and won the goal, because she set out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
                  <p>To sum up all, every good man is a new Creature, and Christianity
is not so much a Divine institution, as a Divine frame and temper of
Spirit, which if we heartily pray for, and endeavour to obtain, we
shall find it as hard and as uneasie to sin against God, as now we think it
impossible to abstain from our most pleasing sins. For as it is in the Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
vertue of the Heavens, which diffuses it self Universally upon
all sublunary bodies, and subtilly insinuating it self into the most dull
and unactive Element, produces Gold and Pearls, Life and motion, and
brisk activities in all things that can receive the influence and heavenly
blessing; so it is in the Holy Spirit of God, and the word of God,
and the grace of God, which S. <hi>John</hi> calls the seed of God, it is a
Law of Righteousness, and it is a Law of the Spirit of Life, and
changes Nature into Grace, and dulness into zeal, and fear into love,
and sinful habits into innocence, and passes on from grace to grace, till
we arrive at the full measures of the stature of Christ, and into the
perfect liberty of the sons of God; so that we shall no more say, The
evil that I would not that I do; but we shall hate what God hates, and
the evil that is forbidden we shall not do, not because we are strong of
our selves, but because Christ is our strength, and he is in us, and Christs
strength shall be perfected in our weakness, and his grace will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for us: and he will of his own good pleasure work in us, not only
to will but also to do, <hi>velle &amp; perficere,</hi> saith the Apostle, to will and
to do it throughly, and fully, being sanctified throughout, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                  <p>THat we are <hi>justified by Faith,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 3. 28. 4. 5. 5. 1. 10. 10. Gal. 2. 16.</note> tells us; That we
are also <hi>justified by Works,</hi> we are told in my Text;
and both may be true. But that this Justification is
wrought by Faith without Works, <hi>to him that worketh not,
but believeth</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul</hi>): That this is not wrought
without Works, S. <hi>James</hi> is as express for his Negative as S. <hi>Paul</hi> was for
his Affirmative; and how both these should be true, is something harder
to unriddle. But, <hi>affirmanti incumbit probatio,</hi> he that affirms must prove;
and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> proves his Doctrine by the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to
whom Faith was imputed for Righteousness; and therefore not by Works.
And what can be answered to this? Nothing but this, That S. <hi>James</hi>
uses the very same Argument to prove that our Justification is by Works
also; [<hi>For our Father</hi> Abraham <hi>was justified by works,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">James 2. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>when he offered up
his Son</hi> Isaac.] Now which of these says true? Certainly both of them;
but neither of them have been well understood; insomuch that they
have not only made divisions of heart among the faithful, but one party
relies on Faith to the disparagement of Good Life, and the other makes
Works to be the main ground of our hope and confidence, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to exclude the efficacy of Faith: The one makes Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
a lazy and unactive Institution; and the other, a bold presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on our selves; while the first tempts us to live like Heathens, and the
other recalls us to live the life of Jews; while one says, <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> and
another <hi>I am of S. James,</hi> and both of them put it in danger of evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the institution and the death of Christ; one looking on Christ only
as a Law-giver, and the other only as a Saviour. The effects of these
are very sad, and by all means to be diverted by all the wise considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>My purpose is not with subtle Arts to reconcile them that never disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed;
the two Apostles spake by the same Spirit, and to the same last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
though to differing intermedial purposes: But because the great end
of Faith, the design, the definition, the state, the oeconomy of it, is that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56643:22"/>
all Believers should not live according to the flesh, but according to the
Spirit. Before I fall to the close handling of the Text, I shall premise
some preliminary Considerations to prepare the way of holiness, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
the differing sences of the Apostles, to understand the Question
and the Duty, by removing the causes of the vulgar mistakes of most
men in this Article, and then proceed to the main Inquiry.</p>
                  <p>1. That no man may abuse himself or others by mistaking of hard
words, spoken in mystery, with alegorical expressions to secret senses,
wrapt up in a cloud; such as are [<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Justification,</hi> and <hi>Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Works</hi>] be pleased to consider, That the very
word <hi>Faith</hi> is in Scripture infinitely ambiguous, insomuch that in the
Latine Concordances of S. <hi>Hierom's</hi> Bible, published by <hi>Robert Stephens,</hi>
you may see no less then twenty two several senses and accceptations of
of the word <hi>Faith,</hi> set down with the several places of Scripture refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to them, to which if out of my own own observation I could add
no more, yet these are an abundant demonstration, That whatsoever is
said of the efficacy of Faith for Justification, is not to be taken in such a
sence as will weaken the necessity, and our carefulness of good life, when
the word may in so many other sences be taken to verifie the affirmation
of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> of Justification by Faith, so as to reconcile it to the necessity
of Obedience.</p>
                  <p>2. As it is in the word <hi>Faith,</hi> so it is in <hi>Works;</hi> for by <hi>Works</hi> is meant
sometimes the thing done, sometimes the labour of doing, sometimes the
good will; it is sometimes taken for a state of good life, sometimes
for the Covenant of Works; it sometimes means the Works of the
Law, sometimes the Works of the Gospel; sometimes it is taken for a
perfect, actual, unsinning Obedience, sometimes for a sincere endeavour
to please God; sometimes they are meant to be such which can challenge
the Reward as of Debt; sometimes they mean only a disposition of the
person to receive the favour and the grace of God. Now since our
good Works can be but of one kind (for ours cannot be meritorious,
ours cannot be without sin all our life, they cannot be such as need no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance),
it is no wonder if we must be justified without Works in this
sence; for by such Works no man living can be justified: And these S.
<hi>Paul</hi> calls the Works of the Law, and sometimes he calls them our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
and these are the Covenant of Works. But because we came
into the World to serve God, and God will be obeyed, and Jesus Christ
came into the World to save us from sin, and <hi>to redeem to himself a people
zealous of good works,</hi> and hath to this purpose reveal'd to us all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Will, and destroyed the works of the Devil, and gives us his holy
Spirit, and by him we shall be justified in this Obedience; therefore
when Works signifie a sincere, hearty endeavour to keep all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
out of a belief in Christ, that if we endeavour to do so we shall
be helped by his grace, and if we really do so we shall be pardoned for
what is past, and if we continue to do so we shall receive a Crown of
Glory; therefore it is no wonder that it is said we are to be justified by
Works; always meaning, not the Works of the Law, that is, Works that
are meritorious, works that can challenge the reward, works that need no
mercy, no repentance, no humiliation, and no appeal to grace and favour;
but always meaning, works that are an obedience to God by the measures
of good will, and a sincere endeavour, and the Faith of the Lord Jesus.</p>
                  <p>3. But thus also it is in the word <hi>Justification:</hi> For God is justified,
and Wisdom is justified, and Man is justified, and a sinner is not justified
as long as he continues in sin; and a sinner is justified when he repents,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56643:22"/>
and when he is pardoned; and an innocent person is justified when he is
declared to be no criminal; and a righteous man is justified when he is
saved; and a weak Christian is justified when his imperfect Services are
accepted for the present, and himself thrust forward to more grace; and
he that is justified may be justified more; and every man that is justified
to one purpose, is not so to all; and Faith in divers sences, gives Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in as many; and therefore though to every sence of Faith there is not
always a degree of Justification in any, yet when the Faith is such that
Justification is the product and correspondent, as that Faith may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
so the Justification is but begun, and either must proceed further, or
else as the Faith will dy, so the Justification will come to nothing. The
like observation might be made concerning Imputation, and all the words
used in this Question; but these may suffice till I pass to other particulars.</p>
                  <p>4. Not only the word <hi>Faith,</hi> but also <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Godliness,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
signifie sometimes particular Graces, and sometimes they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Universally, and mean Conjugations and Unions of Graces, as is
evident to them that read the Scriptures with observation. Now when
Justification is attributed to Faith, or Salvation to Godliness, they are
to be understood in the aggregate sence: for, that I may give but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of Faith as it is a particular Grace,
and separate from the rest, he also does separate it from all possibility of
bringing us to Heaven; <hi>Though I have all Faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>so that I could remove
Mountains, and have no Charity, I am nothing:</hi> When Faith includes
Charity, it will bring us to Heaven; when it is alone, when it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Charity, it will do nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>5. Neither can this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> be salved by saying, That though Faith
alone does justifie, yet when she does justifie, she is not alone, but Good
Works must follow; for this is said to no purpose;</p>
                  <p>1. Because if we be justified by Faith alone, the work is done whether
Charity does follow or no; and therefore that want of Charity cannot
hurt us.</p>
                  <p>2. There can be no imaginable cause why Charity and Obedience
should be at all necessary, if the whole work can be done without it.</p>
                  <p>3. If Obedience and Charity be not a condition of our Salvation,
then it is not necessary to follow Faith; but if it be, it does as much as
Faith, for that is but a part of the condition.</p>
                  <p>4. If we can besaved without Charity and keeping the Commandments,
what need we trouble our selves for them? if we cannot be saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them, then either Faith without them does not justifie, or if it does
we are never the better, for we may be damned for all that Justification.</p>
                  <p>The Consequent of these Observations is briefly this.</p>
                  <p>1. That no man should fool himself by disputing about the Philosophy
of Justification, and what causality Faith hath in it, and whether it be
the act of Faith that justifies, or the habit? Whether Faith as a Good
Work, or Faith as an Instrument? Whether Faith as it is Obedience, or
Faith as it is an Access to Christ? Whether as a Hand, or as a Heart?
Whether by its own innate Vertue, or by the efficacy of the Object?
Whether as a sign, or as a thing signified? Whether by introduction, or
by perfection? Whether in the first beginnings, or in its last and best
productions? Whether by inherent worthiness, or adventitious imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>beriùs ista quaeso, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tuscul. 1.</note> (that I may use the words of <hi>Cicero) haec
enim spinosiora priùs, ut confiteor, me cogunt quam ut assentiar;</hi> These
things are knotty and too intricate to do any good; they may amuse
us, but never instruct us; and they have already made men careless and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56643:23"/>
confident, disputative and troublesome, proud and uncharitable, but
neither wiser nor better. Let us therefore leave these weak wayes of
troubling our selves or others, and directly look to the Theology of it,
the direct duty, the end of Faith, and the work of Faith, the conditions
and the instruments of our Salvation, the just foundation of our hopes,
how our faith can destroy our sin, and how it can unite us unto God;
how by it we can be made Partakers of Christs death, and Imitators of
his life. For since it is evident by the premises, that this article is not
to be determined or relyed upon by arguing from words of many signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
we must walk by a clearer light, by such plain sayings and
Dogmatical Propositions of Scripture which evidently teach us our
duty, and place our hopes upon that which cannot deceive us, that is
which require Obedience, which call upon us to glorifie God, and to
do good to men, and to keep all Gods Commandments with diligence
and sincerity.</p>
                  <p>For since the end of our faith is that we may be Disciples and Servants
of the Lord Jesus, advancing his Kingdom here, and partaking of it
hereafter; since we are commanded to believe what Christ taught, that
it may appear as reasonable as it is necessary to do what he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
since Faith and works are in order one to the other, it is
impossible that Evangelical Faith and Evangelical works should be
opposed one to the other in the effecting of our Salvation. So that as
it is to no purpose for Christians to dispute whether we are justified by
Faith or the works of the Law, that is the Covenant of works without
the help of Faith and the auxiliaries and allowances of mercy on Gods
part, and repentance on ours; because no Christian can pretend to
this: so it is perfectly foolish to dispute whether Christians are to be
justified by Faith, or the works of the Gospel; for I shall make it
appear that they are both the same thing. No man disparages Faith
but he that sayes, Faith does not work righteousness; for he that sayes
so, sayes indeed it cannot justifie; for he sayes that Faith is alone: it is
Faith only, and the words of my Text are plain; <hi>You see</hi> (saith S. <hi>James</hi>)
that is, it is evident to your sense, it is as clear as an ocular demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>that a man is justified by works and not by Faith only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Text hath in it these two Propositions; a negative and
an affirmative. The negative is this, 1. By Faith only a man is
not justified. The affirmative, 2. By works also a man is justified.</p>
                  <p>When I have briefly discoursed of these, I shall only adde such
practical considerations as shall make the Doctrines useful, and tangible,
and material.</p>
                  <p>1. By Faith only a man is not justified. By Faith only, here is meant,
Faith without Obedience. For what do we think of those that detain
the Faith in Unrighteousness? they have Faith, they could not else
keep it in so ill a Cabinet: but yet the Apostle reckons them amongst the
Reprobates; for the <hi>abominable, the Reprobates and the disobedient</hi> are
all one; and therefore such persons for all their Faith shall have no
part with faithful <hi>Abraham:</hi> for none are his Children but they that
<hi>do the works of</hi> Abraham. Abraham's <hi>faith without</hi> Abraham's <hi>works
is nothing:</hi> for of him <hi>that hath faith, and hath not works,</hi> S. <hi>James</hi> askes,
<hi>can Faith save him?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iames. 2. 14.</note> Meaning that it is impossible. For what think
we of those that did miracles in Christs name, and in his name cast out
Devils? Have not they Faith? Yes, <hi>omnem fidem,</hi> all faith, that is
alone, for they could remove Mountains: but yet to many of them
Christ will say, <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquity, I know you not</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:56643:23"/>
Nay at last, what think we of the Devils themselves? have not they
faith? yes, and this faith is not <hi>fides miraculorum</hi> neither, but it is
an Operative faith, it works a little; for it makes them tremble; and
it may be that is more than they faith does to thee: and yet dost thou
hope to be saved by a faith that does less to thee than the Devils faith
does to him? That's impossible. For <hi>Faith without works is dead,</hi>
saith S. <hi>James.</hi> It is <hi>manus arida</hi> saith S. <hi>Austin,</hi> it is a withered hand;
and that which is dead cannot work the life of grace in us, much less
obtain eternal life for us. In short, a man may have faith, and yet
do the works of unrighteousness; he may have faith and be a Devil,
and then what can such a faith do to him or for him? It can do him no
good in the present constitution of affairs. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> from whose mistaken
works much noise hath been made in this question, is clear in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
<hi>Nothing in Christ Jesus can avail,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>but Faith working by Charity;</hi>
that is, as he expounds himself once and again; <hi>nothing but a new creature,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 15.</note>
                     <hi>nothing but keeping the Commandments of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 19.</note> If faith be defin'd to be
any thing that does not change our natures, and make us to be a new
Creation unto God; if keeping the Commandments be not in the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of faith, it avails nothing at all. Therefore deceive not your selves;
they are the words of our Blessed Lord himself; <hi>Not every one that saith
unto me Lord, Lord,</hi> that is, not every one that confesses Christ, and believes
in him, calling Christ Master and Lord shall be sav'd, <hi>but he that doth
the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> These things are so plain, that
they need no Commentary; so evident, that they cannot be denyed:
and to these I add but this one truth; that faith alone without a good
life is so far from justifying a sinner, that it is one of the greatest
aggravations of his condemnation in the whole World. For no man
can be so greatly damned as he that hath faith; for unless he knows
his Masters will, that is, by faith be convinced, and assents to the
revelations of the will of God, <hi>he can be beaten but with few stripes:</hi> but
he that believes hath no excuse, he is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, condemn'd by the sentence of his own heart, and therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, many stripes, the
greater condemnation shall be his portion. Natural reason is a light to
the Conscience, but faith is a greater, and therefore if it be not followed,
it damns deeper than the Hell of the Infidels and uninstructed. And so
I have done with the Negative Proposition of my Text; a man is not
justified by faith alone, that is, by faith which hath not in it Charity
and Obedience.</p>
                  <p>2. If faith alone will not do it, what will? The affirmative part of
the Text answers; not faith alone; but works must be an ingredient:
a man is justified by works; and that is now to be explicated and prov'd.
It will be absolutely to no purpose to say that faith alone does justifie,
if when a man is justified, he is never the nearer to be saved. Now that
without Obedience no man can go to Heaven,<note place="margin">Isai. 57. 21.</note> is so evident in holy
Scripture, that he that denyes it, hath no faith.<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>There is no peace saith
my God unto the wicked;</hi> and <hi>I will not justifie a sinner,</hi> saith God; unless
faith purges away our sins it can never justifie. Let a man believe all
the revelations of God, if that belief ends in its self and goes no further,
it is like physick taken to purge the stomach; if it do not work, it is so
far from bringing health, that it self is a new sickness. Faith is a great
purger and purifier of the soul, <hi>purifying your hearts by Faith,</hi> saith
the Apostle. It is the best physick in the World for a sinful soul,
but if it does not work, it corrupts in the stomack, it makes us to
rely upon weak Propositions and trifling confidences, it is but a dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56643:24"/>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Phantastick dream, and introduces Pride or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
swelling thoughts and presumptions of the Divine favour: But
what saith the Apostle? <hi>Follow Peace with all men, &amp; Holiness, without which
no man can see God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> Mark that. If Faith does not make you charitable
and holy, talk no more of justification by it, for you shall never see the
glorious face of God. Faith indeed is a title and relation to Christ;
it is a naming of his names, but what then? Why then saith the Apostle,
<hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For let any man consider, can the Faith of Christ, and the hatred of
God stand together? Can any man be justified that does not love God?
Or can any man love God and sin at the same time? And does not he
love sin that falls under its temptation, and obeyes it in the lusts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and delights in the vanity, and makes excuses for it, and returns to
it with passion, and abides with pleasure? This will not do it; such a
man cannot be justified for all his believing. But therefore the Apostle
shews us a more excellent way: <hi>This is a true saying,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Titus 3. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>and I will that
thou affirm constantly, that they who have believed in God, be careful to
maintain good works.</hi> The Apostle puts great force on this Doctrine,
he arms it with a double Preface; the saying is true, and it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
affirmed; that is, it is not only true, but necessary; it is like <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s
dream doubled, because it is bound upon us by the decree of
God, and it is unalterably certain, that every Believer must do good
works, or his believing will signifie little; nay more than so, every man
must be careful to do good works; and more yet, he must carefully
maintain them, that is, not do them by fits and interrupted returns, but
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to be incumbent upon them, to dwell upon them, to maintain
good works, that is, to persevere in them. But I am yet but in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
be pleased to go along with me in these particular considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>1. No mans sins are pardoned, but in the same measure in which
they are mortified, destroyed and taken away; so that if Faith does
not cure our sinful Natures it never can justifie, it never can procure
our pardon. And therefore it is, that as soon as ever Faith in the Lord
Jesus was Preached, at the same time also they preached Repentance
from dead works:<note place="margin">Hebr. 6. 1.</note> in so much that S. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons it among the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
and first principles of Christianity; nay, the Baptist preached
repentance and amendment of life as a preparation to the Faith of
Christ. And I pray consider; can there be any forgiveness of sins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance? But if an Apostle should preach forgiveness to all that
believe, and this belief did not also mean that they should repent and
forsake their sin, the Sermons of the Apostle would make Christianity
nothing else but the Sanctuary of <hi>Romulus,</hi> a device to get together all
the wicked people of the world, and to make them happy without any
change of manners. Christ came to other purposes; he came <hi>to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
us and to cleanse us by his Word;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 8.</note> the word of Faith was not for it
self, but was a design of holiness, and the very <hi>grace of God did appear,</hi>
for this end;<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25.</note> that <hi>teaching us to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts,
we should live holily,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>justly, and soberly in this present world:</hi> he came to
gather a People together; not like <hi>Davids</hi> Army, when <hi>Saul</hi> pursued
him, but the Armies of the Lord, <hi>a faithful people, a chosen generation;</hi>
and what is that? The Spirit of God adds, <hi>a People zealous of good
works.</hi> Now as Christ proved his power to forgive sins by curing the
poor mans Palsie, because a man is never pardoned but when the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
is removed; so the great act of justification of a sinner, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56643:24"/>
of his sins is then only effected, when the spiritual evil is taken
away: that's the best indication of a real and an eternal pardon, when
God takes away the hardness of the heart, the love of sin, the accursed
habit, the evil inclination, the sin that doth so easily beset us: and
when that is gone, what remains within us that God can hate? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
stayes behind, but Gods creation, the work of his own hands,
the issues of his holy Spirit. The Faith of a Christian is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
it destroyes the whole body of sin; and to suppose that Christ
pardons a sinner, whom he doth not also purge and rescue from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of sin, is to affirm that he justifies the wicked, that he calls good
evil, and evil good, that he delights in a wicked person, that he makes
a wicked man all one with himself; that he makes the members of an
harlot at the same time also the members of Christ: but all this is
impossible, and therefore ought not to be pretended to by any Christian.
Severe are those words of our Blessed Saviour,<note place="margin">John. 15. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Every plant in me that
beareth not fruit he taketh away:</hi> Faith ingrafts us into Christ; by Faith
we are inserted into the vine; but the plant that is ingrafted, must also
be parturient and fruitful, or else it shall be quite cut off from the root,
and thrown into the everlasting burning: And this is the full and plain
meaning of those words so often used in Scripture for the magnification
of Faith, <hi>The just shall live by Faith:</hi> No man shall live by Faith but
the just man; he indeed is justified by Faith, but no man else; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
and the unrighteous man hath no portion in this matter. That's
the first great consideration in this affair; no man is justified in the least
sense of justification, that is, when it means nothing but the pardon of
sins, but when his sin is mortified and destroyed.</p>
                  <p>2. No man is actually justified, but he that is in some measure sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
For the understanding and clearing of which Proposition we must
know, that justification when it is attributed to any cause, does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
signifie justification actual. Thus when it is said in Scripture, <hi>We
are justified by the death of Christ,</hi> it is but the same thing as to say, <hi>Christ
dyed for us;</hi> and he rose again for us too, that we might indeed be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in due time, and by just measures and dispositions; <hi>he dyed for our
sins, and rose again for our justification;</hi> that is, by his Death and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
he hath obtained this power, and effected this mercy, that if we
believe him and obey, we shall be justified and made capable of all
the blessings of the Kingdom. But that this is no more but a capacity
of pardon, of grace and of salvation, appears not only by Gods requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Obedience as a condition on our parts; but by his expresly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this mercy to us at such times and in such circumstances, in which
it is certain and evident that we could not actually be justified; for so
saith the Scripture,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 8. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>We when we were enemies, were reconciled to God by
the death of his Son; and while we were yet sinners, Christ dyed for us;</hi>
that is, then was our Justification wrought on Gods part, that is, then he
intended this mercy to us, then he resolved to shew us favour, to give
us Promises, and Laws, and Conditions, and Hopes, and an infallible Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy
of Salvation; and when Faith layes hold on this Grace, and this
Justification, then we are to do the other part of it; that is, as God
made it potential by the Death and Resurrection of Christ, so we lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hold on these things by Faith, and working the Righteousness of
Faith, that is, performing what is required on our parts, we, I say, make
it actual; and for this very reason it is that the Apostle puts more <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis</hi>
upon the Resurrection of Christ than upon his Death. <hi>Who is he
that condemneth? It is Christ that dyed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>yea rather, that is risen again.</hi>

And <hi>Christ was both delivered for our sins, and is risen again for our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification;</hi>
implying to us, that as it is in the principal, so it is in the
correspondent; our sins indeed are potentially pardoned, when they are
marked out for death and crucifixion;<note place="margin">Rom. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25.</note> when by resolving and fighting
against sin we dye to sin daily, and are so made conformable to his
Death; but we must partake of Christs Resurrection before this Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
can be actual; when we are <hi>dead to sin, and are risen again unto
righteousness,</hi> then as we are <hi>partakers of his Death,</hi> so we shall <hi>be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his Resurrection</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) that is, then we are truly, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and indeed justified, till then we are not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that loveth Gold shall not be justified,</hi>

                     </note> saith the wise <hi>Bensirach;</hi> he
that is covetous, let his Faith be what it will, shall not be accounted

in Christ, for he is not in Christ at all; he hath no righteousness in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 10.</note> and he hath none in Christ; for if we be in Christ, or <hi>if Christ be in
us, the Body is dead by reason of sin, and the Spirit is life because of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:</hi>
For this the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that faithful thing, that is, the faithfulness
is manifested; the <hi>Emun,</hi> from whence comes <hi>Emunah,</hi> which is the
Hebrew word for Faith, from whence <hi>Amen</hi> is derived. <hi>Fiat quod dictum
est hinc inde; hoc fidum est,</hi> when God and we both say <hi>Amen</hi> to our
promises and undertakings. <hi>Fac fidelis sis fideli,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plaut. Captiv.</note> 
                     <hi>cave fidem fluxam geras,</hi>
said he in the Comedy, God is faithful, be thou so too, for if thou failest
him, thy faith hath failed thee. <hi>Fides sumitur pro eo quod est inter utrumque
placitum,</hi> says one; and then it is true which the Prophet and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
said, <hi>the Just shall live by Faith,</hi> in both senses: <hi>ex fide mea vivet, ex
fide sua;</hi> we live by Gods Faith, and by our own; by his Fidelity, and
by ours. When the righteousness of God becomes <hi>your righteousness,
and exceeds the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees;</hi> when the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the Law is fulfilled in us, <hi>by walking not after the flesh, but
after the Spirit;</hi> then we are justified by Gods truth and by ours, by his
Grace, and our Obedience. So that now we see that Justification and
Sanctification cannot be distinguished, but as words of Art signifying
the various steps of progression in the same course, they may be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in notion and speculation, but never when they are to pass on
to material events; for no man is justified but he that is also sanctified.
They are the express words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Whom he did foreknow, them he
did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son,</hi> to be like to
Christ; and then it follows, <hi>Whom he hath predestinated,</hi> so predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
<hi>them he hath also called, and whom he hath called, them he hath
also justified;</hi> and then it follows, <hi>Whom he hath justified, them he hath also
glorified.</hi> So that no man is justified, that is, so as to signifie Salvation,
but Sanctification must be precedent to it; and that was my second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that which I was to prove.</p>
                  <p>3. I pray consider, that he that does not believe the promises of the
Gospel, cannot pretend to Faith in Christ; but the promises are all made
to us upon the conditions of Obedience, and he that does not believe
them as Christ made them, believes them not at all. <hi>In well doing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your selves to God as unto a faithful Creator;</hi> there is no committing
our selves to God without well doing,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 6 7, 8.</note> 
                     <hi>For God will render to every man
according to his deeds; to them that obey unrighteousness, indignation and
wrath; but to them who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and honour, and immortality, to them eternal life.</hi> So that if Faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
any other promises, it is illusion, and not Faith; God gave us
none such, Christ purchased none such for us; search the Bible over
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56643:25"/>
and you shall find none such. But if Faith layes hold on these promises
that are, and as they are, then it becomes an Article of our Faith, that
without obedience and a sincere endeavour to keep Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
no man living can be justified: And therefore let us take heed
when we magnifie the free Grace of God, we do not exclude the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which this free Grace hath set upon us. Christ freely dyed for us,
God pardons us freely in our first access to him; we could never deserve
pardon, because when we need pardon we are enemies, and have no
good thing in us; and he freely gives us of his Spirit, and freely he ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
us to obey him, and for our little imperfect services he freely
and bountifully will give us eternal life; here is free Grace all the way,
and he overvalues his pitiful services, who thinks that he deserves Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by them; and that if he does his duty tolerably, eternal life is not a
free gift to him, but a deserved reward.

                        <l>Conscius est animus meus, experientia testis,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>It was the meditation of the wise Chancellor of <hi>Paris:</hi> I know that
without a good life, and the fruits of repentance, a sinner cannot be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
and therefore I must live well, or I must dye for ever: But if I
do live holily, I do not think that I deserve Heaven, it is the Cross of
Christ that procures me grace; it is the Spirit of Christ that gives me
grace; it is the mercy and the free gift of Christ that brings me unto
glory. But yet he that shall exclude the works of Faith from the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of a sinner by the blood of Christ, may as well exclude Faith
it self; for Faith it self is one of the works of God: it is a good work,
<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 28. 29.</note> so said Christ to them that asked him. [<hi>What shall we do to work the works
of God? Jesus said, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom
he hath sent.</hi>] Faith is not only the foundation of good works, but it self
is a good work, it is not only the cause of obedience, but a part
of it; it is not as the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> calls it, <hi>initium adhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendi
Deo,</hi> a beginning of cleaving unto God, but it carries us on to the
perfection of it. Christ is the Author and finisher of our Faith, and
when Faith is finished, a good life is made perfect in our kind: Let no
man therefore expect events for which he hath no promise, nor call for
Gods fidelity without his own faithfulness, nor snatch at a promise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
performing the condition; nor think faith to be a hand to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
Christ, and to do nothing else; for that will but deceive us, and
turn Religion into words, and Holiness into hypocrisie, and the Promises
of God into a snare, and the Truth of God into a ly. For when God
made a Covenant of Faith, he made also the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Law of
Faith; and when he admitted us to a Covenant of more mercy than was
in the Covenant of works, or of the Law, he did not admit us to a
Covenant of idleness, and an incurious walking in a state of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but the mercy of God leadeth us to repentance, and when he gives
us better promises, he intends we should pay him a better obedience:
when he forgives us what is past, he intends we should sin no more:
when he offers us his graces, he would have us to make use of them;
when he causes us to distrust our selves, his meaning is we should rely
upon him; when he enables us to do what he commands us, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to do all that we can. And therefore this Covenant of Faith
and Mercy is also a Covenant of Holiness, and the grace that pardons us
does also purifie us; for so saith the Apostle, <hi>He that hath this hope puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56643:26"/>
himself even as God is pure.</hi> And when we are so, then we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
indeed; this is the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Law of faith; and by works in
this sense, that is by the works of faith, by faith working by love, and
producing fruits worthy of amendment of ife, we are justified before
God. And so I have done with the affirmative Proposition of my Text;
you see that a man is justified by works.</p>
                  <p>But there is more in it than this matter yet amounts to: for S. <hi>James</hi>
does not say, we are justified by works, and are not justified by faith;
that had been irreconcileable with S. <hi>Paul;</hi> but we are so justified by
works, that it is not by Faith alone; it is faith and works together:
that is, it is by the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by the obedience of faith, by the works of
Faith, by the Law of faith, by Righteousness Evangelical, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the Gospel and the measures of Christ. I have many things
to say in this particular; but because I have but a little time left to say
them in, I will sum it all up in this Proposition, That in the question of
justification and salvation, faith and good works are no part of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
but members of one entire body. Faith and good works to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
work the righteousness of God: That is, that I may speak plainly,
justifying faith contains in it obedience; and if this be made good, then
the two Apostles are reconciled to each other, and both of them to the
necessity, the indispensible necessity of a good life.</p>
                  <p>Now that justifying and saving faith must be defined by something
more than an act of understanding, appears not only in this, that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
reckons faith as distinctly from knowledge, as he does from patience,
or strength or brotherly kindness; saying [<hi>Add to your faith vertue, to
vertue knowledge</hi>]<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 5.</note> but in this also; because an error in life, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is against holiness, is against faith: And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons
the lawless and the disobedient, murderers of Parents, man-stealing and
such things to be against sound Doctrines; for the Doctrine of faith is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Doctrine that is according to godliness.
And when S. <hi>Paul</hi> prayes against ungodly men, he adds this reason,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for all men have not faith:<note place="margin">2 Thes. 3. 2.</note> meaning that wicked men
are Infidels and Unbelievers, and particularly he affirms of him <hi>that does
not provide for his own, that he hath denyed the Faith.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 8.</note> Now from hence
it follows that faith is godliness, because all wickedness is infidelity, it is
an Apostacy from the faith. <hi>Ille erit, ille nocens qui me tibi fecerat hostem;</hi>
he that sins against God, he is the enemy to the faith of Jesus Christ, and
therefore we deceive our selves if we place faith in the understanding
only; it is not that, and it does not well there, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, saith
the Apostle, the Mystery of faith is kept no where, it dwells no where
but in a pure conscience.</p>
                  <p>For I consider that since all moral habits are best defined by their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
we can best understand what faith is by seeing what it does. To
this purpose hear S. <hi>Paul</hi>:<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>By faith</hi> Abel <hi>offered up to God a more excellent
Sacrifice than</hi> Cain. <hi>By faith</hi> Noah <hi>made an Ark. By faith</hi> Abraham <hi>left
his Country and offered up his Son. By faith</hi> Moses <hi>chose to suffer affliction,
and accounted the reproach of Christ greater than all the riches of</hi> Aegypt. In
short, the children of God <hi>by faith subdued Kingdoms, and wrought righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:</hi>
To work righteousness is as much the duty and work of faith as
believing is. So that now we may quickly make an end of this great inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whether a man is justified by faith, or by works, for he is so by both;
if you take it alone, faith does not justifie, but take it in the aggregate
sense as it is used in the question of Justification by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and then faith
does not only justifie, but it sanctifies too; and then you need to enquire no
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56643:26"/>
further; obedience is a part of the definition of faith, as much as it is
of Charity: This is love saith S. <hi>John, that we keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ecclus. 32. 24.</note>
And the very same is affirmed of faith too by <hi>Bensirach, He that
believeth the Lord will keep his Commandments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have now done with all the Propositions expressed and implyed in
the Text; give me leave to make some practical Considerations, and so
I shall dismiss you from this Attention.</p>
                  <p>The rise I take from the words of S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> speaking in praise of
the Apostolical and purest Ages of the Church:<note place="margin">Panar. lib. 1. edit. Basil. p. 8. l. 46.</note> There was at first no
distinction of Sects and Opinions in the Church: she knew no difference
of men, but good and bad; there was no separation made, but what
was made by piety or impiety, or (sayes he) which is all one, by fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and infidelity: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
For faith hath in it the Image of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
engraven, and infidelity hath the Character of wickedness and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication.
A man was not then esteemed a Saint for disobeying his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
or an Apostle, nor for misunderstanding the hard sayings of S. <hi>Paul</hi>
about predestination; to kick against the laudable Customs of the
Church was not then accounted a note of the godly party: and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
Government was but an ill mark, and weak indication of being a
good Christian. The Kingdom of God did not then consist in words,
but in power, the power of godliness; though now we are fallen into
another method: we have turned all Religion into Faith, and our faith
is nothing but the productions of interest or disputing; it is adhering
to a party, and a wrangling against all the world beside; and when it is
asked of what Religion he is of, we understand the meaning to be, what
faction does he follow; what are the Articles of his Sect, not what is
the manner of his life: and if men be zealous for their party and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
then they are precious men, though otherwise they be covetous
as the Grave, factious as <hi>Dathan,</hi> Schismatical as <hi>Corah,</hi> or proud as the
falling Angels. Alas! these things will but deceive us, the faith of a
Christian cannot consist in strifes about words, and perverse disputings of
men: These things the Apostle calls <hi>prophane and vain bablings;</hi> and
mark what he sayes of them,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 16.</note> these things will encrease <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
They are in themselves ungodliness, and will produce
more; they will encrease unto more ungodliness: but the faith of a
Christian had other measures: that was faith then which made men
faithful to their vows in Baptism. The faith of a Christian was the
best security in contracts, and a Christians word was as good as his
bond, because he was faithful that promised; and a Christian would
rather dye than break his word; and was always true to his trust; he
was faithful to his friend, and loved as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did <hi>David.</hi> This was
the Christian faith then: their Religion was to hurt no man, and to do
good to every man, and so it ought to be: <hi>True Religion is to visit the
Fatherless and Widow, and to keep our selves unspotted of the World.</hi>
That's a good religion, that's <hi>pure and undefiled:</hi> so S. <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>S.
Chrysostom</hi> defines <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, true Religion to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a
pure faith and a godly life, for they make up the whole mystery of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;
and no man could then pretend to faith, but he that did do vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly,
and suffer patiently, and resist the Devil, and overcome the world.
These things are as properly the actions of Faith, as alms is of Charity, and
therefore they must enter into the moral definition of it: And this was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood by <hi>Salvian,</hi> that wise and godly Priest of <hi>Massilia;</hi> what is
faith, and what is believing (saith he) <hi>hominem fideliter Christo credere est
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56643:27"/>
fidelem Deo esse,</hi> h. e. <hi>fideliter Dei mandata servare.</hi> That man does faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
believe in Christ who is faithful unto God, who faithfully keeps
Gods commandments: and therefore let us measure our faith here by
our faithfulness to God, and by our diligence to do our Masters Comand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
for <hi>Christianorum omnis religio sine scelere &amp; maculâ vivere,</hi>
said <hi>Lactantius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Instit l. 5. c. 9.</note> the whole religion of a Christian is to live unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably;
that is, in all holiness and purity of conversation.</p>
                  <p>2. When our faith is spoken of as the great instrument of justification
and salvation, take <hi>Abraham's</hi> faith as your best pattern, and that will
end the dispute, because that he was justified by faith when his faith
was mighty in effect; when he trusted in God, when he believed the
promises, when he expected a resurrection of the dead, when he was
strong in Faith, when he gave glory to God, when against hope he
believed in hope; and when all this past into an act of a most glorious
obedience, even denying his greatest desires, contradicting his most
passionate affections, offering to God the best thing he had, and exposing
to death his beloved <hi>Isaac,</hi> his laughters, all his joy at the command
of God. By this faith he was justified, saith S. <hi>Paul; by these works he
was justified,</hi> faith S. <hi>James;</hi> that is, by this faith working this obedience.
And then all the difficulty is over; only remember this, your faith is
weak and will do but little for you, if it be not stronger then all your
secular desires and all your peevish angers. Thus we find in the holy
Gospels,<note place="margin">Mark. 12. 24.</note> this conjunction declared necessary, <hi>Whatsoever things ye desire,
when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</hi> Here
is as glorious an event promised to Faith as can be expressed, Faith shall
obtain any thing of God. True; but it is not Faith alone; but faith
in prayer; Faith praying, not Faith simply believing. So S. <hi>James;</hi>
the <hi>prayer of Faith shall save the sick;</hi> but adds, it must be the effectual
fervent prayer of a righteous man; so that faith shall prevail, but there
must be prayer in faith, and fervour in prayer, and devotion in fervour,
and righteousness in devotion, and then impute the effect to faith if you
please, provided that it be declared, that effect cannot be wrought by
Faith unless it be so qualified. But Christ adds one thing more; <hi>When ye
stand praying, forgive; but if ye will not forgive, neither will your Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
you.</hi> So that it will be to no purpose to say a man is justified by faith,
unless you mingle charity with it: for without the charity of forgiveness,
there can be no pardon; and then justification is but a word, when
it effects nothing.</p>
                  <p>3. Let every one take heed that by an importune adhering to and
relying upon a mistaken Faith, he do not really make a shipwrack of
a right Faith. <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> lost their Faith by putting away
a good conscience; and what matter is it of what Religion or Faith a
man be of, if he be a Villain and a cheat, a man of no truth, and of
no trust, a lover of the World, and not a lover of God? But I pray
consider, can any man have Faith that denyes God? That's not possible:
and cannot a man as well deny God by an evil action, as by an heretical
Proposition? Cannot a man deny God by works as much as by words?
Hear what the Apostle sayes,<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>They profess that they know God, but in
works they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and unto every
good work reprobate.</hi> Disobedience is a denying God. <hi>Nolumus hunc
regnare,</hi> is as plain a renouncing of Christ, as <hi>nolumus huic credere.</hi> It
is to no purpose to say we believe in Christ and have Faith, unless Christ
reign in our hearts by Faith.</p>
                  <p>4. From these premises we may see but too evidently, that though a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56643:27"/>
great part of mankind pretend to be saved by Faith, yet they know not
what it is, or else wilfully mistake it, and place their hopes upon sand, or
the more unstable water. Believing is the least thing in a justifying Faith;
for Faith is a conjugation of many Ingredients, and faith is a Covenant,
and faith is a Law, and faith is Obedience, and faith is a Work, and
indeed it is a sincere cleaving to, and closing with the terms of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
in every instance, in every particular. Alas! the niceties of a spruce
understanding, and the curious nothings of useless speculation, and all
the opinions of men that make the divisions of heart, and do nothing
else, cannot bring us one drop of comfort in the day of tribulation,
and therefore are no parts of the strength of faith: Nay, when a man
begins truly to fear God, and is in the Agonies of Mortification, all
these new-nothings and curiosities will lye neglected by, as baubles do
by Children when they are deadly sick: But that only is faith that
makes us to love God, to do his will, to suffer his impositions, to trust
his promises, to see through a cloud, to overcome the World, to resist
the Devil, to stand in the day of tryal, and to be comforted in all our
sorrows. <hi rend="margQuotes">This is that precious faith so mainly necessary to be insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on, that by it we may be Sons of the free woman, <hi>liberi à vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis ac ritibus,</hi>
that the true <hi>Isaac</hi> may be in us, which is Christ accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Spirit, the wisdom and power of God, a Divine vigour
and life, whereby we are enabled with joy and cheerfulness to walk
in the way of God.</hi> By this you may try your faith, if you please,
and make an end of this question: Do you believe in the Lord Jesus,
yea or no? God forbid else, but if your faith be good it will abide the
tryal. There are but three things that make the integrity of Christian
faith; believing the words of God, confidence in his goodness, and
keeping his Commandments.</p>
                  <p>For the first, it is evident that every man pretends to it; if he calls
himself Christian, he believes all that is in the Canon of the Scriptures;
and if he did not, he were indeed no Christian. But now consider, what
think we of this Proposition? <hi>All shall be damned who believe not the
truth, but have pleasure in unrighteousness:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 12.</note> Does not every man believe
this? Is it possible they can believe there is any such thing as unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
in the World, or any such thing as damnation; and yet commit
that which the Scriptures call unrighteousness, and which all Laws, and
all good men say is so? Consider how many unrighteous men there are
in the world, and yet how few of them think they shall be damned. I
know not how it comes to pass, but men go upon strange principles, and
they have made Christianity to be a very odd Institution, if it had not
better measures than they are pleased to afford it. There are two great
roots of all evil, Covetousness and Pride, and they have infected the
greatest parts of mankind, and yet no man thinks himself to be either
Covetous or Proud: And therefore whatever you discourse against these
sins, it never hits any man, but like <hi>Jonathans</hi> Arrows to <hi>David,</hi> they
fall short or they fly beyond: <hi>Salvian</hi> complained of it in his time, <hi>Hoc
ad crimina nostra addimus, ut cum in omnibus rei simus, etiam bonos nos
&amp; sanctos esse credamus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 3.</note> This we add unto our crimes, we are the vilest
persons in the world, and yet we think our selves to be good people, and
when we die make no question but we shall go to Heaven. There is no
cause of this, but because we have not so much faith as believing comes
to, and yet most men will pretend not only to believe, but to love
Christ all this while: And how do they prove this? Truly they hate
the memory of <hi>Judas,</hi> and curse the Jews that crucified Christ, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56643:28"/>
think <hi>Pilate</hi> a very miserable man, and that all the Turks are damned; and to be called <hi>Caiphas</hi> is a word of reproach; and indeed there are
many that do not much more for Christ than this comes to; things to
as little purpose, and of as little signification. But so the Jews did hate
the memory of <hi>Corah</hi> as we do of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and they builded the Sepulchre
of the Prophets; and we also are angry at them that killed the Apostles
and the Martyrs, but in the mean time we neither love Christ nor his
Saints; for we neither obey him, nor imitate them: And yet we should
think our selves highly injured, if one should call us Infidels and haters
of Christ. But I pray consider; what is hating of any man, but designing
and doing him all the injury and spite we can? Does not he hate Christ
that dishonours him, that makes Christs members the members of an
harlot? That doth not feed and clothe these members? If the
Jews did hate Christ when they crucified him, then so does a Christian
too when he crucifies him again. Let us not deceive our selves; a
Christian may be damned as well as a Turk; and Christians may with
as much malice crucifie Christ as the Jews did: And so does every man
that sins wilfully; he spills the blood of Christ, making it to be spent
in vain. <hi>He that hateth you, hateth me, he that receives you, receives me,</hi>
said Christ to his Apostles. I wish the world had so much faith as to
believe that; and by this try whether we love Christ, and believe in
him or no. I shall for the tryal of our faith ask one easie question; Do
we believe that the story of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> is true? Have we so
much faith as to think it possible that two Rivals of a Crown should
love so dearly? Can any man believe this, and not be infinitely ashamed
to see Christians (almost all Christians) to be irreconcileably angry, and
ready to pull their brothers heart out, when he offers to take our Land
or money from us? Why do almost all men that go to Law for right hate
one anothers persons? Why cannot men with patience hear their titles
questioned? But if Christianity be so excellent a Religion, why are so
very many Christians so very wicked? Certainly they do not so much
as believe the propositions and principles of their own Religion. For the
body of Christians is so universally wicked, that it would be a greater
change to see Christians generally live according to their profession, than
it was at first from infidelity to see them to turn Believers: The conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from Christian to Christian, from Christian in title to Christian in
sincerity, would be a greater miracle then it was when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from Heathen and Jew to Christian. What is the matter? Is not
<hi>repentance from dead works</hi> reckoned by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. as one of
the fundamental points of Christian Religion? Is it not a piece of our
Catechism, the first thing we are taught, and is it not the last thing that
we practise? We had better be without Baptism than without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and yet both are necessary; and therefore if we were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
faith, we should be without neither. Is not Repentance a forsaking
all sin, and an intire returning unto God? Who can deny this? And
is it not plainly said in Scripture, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nless ye repent ye shall all perish?</hi> But
shew me the man that believes these things heartily: that is, shew me
a true penitent, he only believes the doctrines of repentance.</p>
                  <p>If I had time I should examine your faith by your confidence in God,
and by your obedience. But if we fall in the meer believing, it is not
likely we should do better in the other. But because all the promises of
God are conditional, and there can be no confidence in the particular
without a promise or revelation, it is not possible that any man that does
not live well should reasonably put his trust in God. To live a wicked
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56643:28"/>
life, and then to be confident that in the day of our death God will give
us pardon, is not faith, but a direct want of faith. If we did believe
the promises upon their proper conditions, or believe that Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
were righteous and true, or that the threatnings were as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
intended as they are terribly spoken, we should not dare to live at
the rate we do: But <hi>wicked men have not faith,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and then the
wonder ceases.</p>
                  <p>But there are such palpable contradictions between mens practices and
the fundamentals of our faith, that it was a material consideration of
our Blessed Saviour, <hi>When the Son of man comes shall he find faith upon
earth?</hi> Meaning it should be very hard and scant: <hi>every man shall boast
of his own goodness; sed virum fidelem,</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) but a faithful man
who can find?</hi> Some men are very good when they are afflicted.

                  <p>When the gown of the day is the mantle of the night, and cannot at
the same time cover the head, and make the feet warm; when they
have but one broken dish and no spoon, then they are humble and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest;
then they can suffer an injury, and bear contempt: but give them
riches and they grow insolent; fear and pusillanimity did their first
work, and an opportunity to sin undoes it all. <hi>Bonum militem perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disti,
Imperatorem pessimum creasti,</hi> said <hi>Galba,</hi> you have spoiled a good
Trooper when you made me a bad Commander. Others can never
serve God but when they are prosperous, if they lose their fortune they
lose their faith, and quit their Charity: <hi>Non rata fides ubi jam melior for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna
ruit;</hi> if they become poor, they become lyars and deceivers of
their trust, envious and greedy, restless and uncharitable; that is, one
way or other they shew that they love the world, and by all the faith
they pretend to cannot overcome it.</p>
                  <p>Cast up therefore your reckonings impartially; see what is, what will
be required at your hands: do not think you can be justified by faith,
unless your faith be greater than all your passions; you have not the
learning, not so much as the common notices of faith, unless you can
tell when you are covetous, and reprove your self when you are proud;
but he that is so, and knows it not (and that is the case of most men)
hath no faith, and neither knows God, nor knows himself.</p>
                  <p>To conclude. He that hath true justifying faith, believes the power
of God to be above the powers of nature; the goodness of God above
the merit and disposition of our persons, the bounty of God above the
excellency of our works, the truth of God above the contradiction of
our weak arguings and fears, the love of God above our cold experience
and ineffectual reason, and the necessities of doing good works above
the faint excuses and ignorant pretences of disputing sinners: But want
of faith makes us so generally wicked as we are, so often running to
despair; so often baffled in our resolutions of a good life: But he whose
faith makes him more than Conqueror over these difficulties, to him
<hi>Isaac</hi> shall be born even in his old age; the life of God shall be perfectly
wrought in him, and by this faith so operative, so strong, so lasting, so
obedient, he shall be justified, and he shall be saved.</p>

                  <head>To the
CHRISTIAN
READER.</head>
                  <p>MY Obedience to the Commands of the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
the Lord Justices, and the most Reverend and
Learned Primate, and to the desires of my Reverend
Brethren, put it past my inquiry, whether I ought
to publish this following Sermon. I will not therefore excuse it,
and say it might have advantages in the Delivery, which it
would want in the Reading; and the ear would be kind to the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it, which was apparent in the design, when the eye would be
severe in its censure of those arguments, which as they could not
be longer in that measure of time, so would have appeared more
firm, if they could have had liberty to have been pursued to their
utmost issue: But Reason lies in a little room, and Obedience in
less; and although what I have here said, may not stop the mouths
of Men resolved to keep up a Faction, yet I have said enough to
the sober and pious, to them who love Order, and hearken to the
voice of the Spouse of Christ, to the Loving and to the Obedient:
And for those that are not so, I have no argument fit to be used,
but Prayer, and readiness to give them a Reason when they shall
modestly demand it. In the mean time I shall only desire them to
make use of those Truths which the more Learned of their party
have by the evidence of fact been forced to confess. <hi>Rivet</hi> affirms
that it descended <hi>ex veteris aevi reliquiis,</hi> that Presbyters should
be assistants or conjoyned to the Bishops (who is by this confessed to
be the principal) in the imposition of hands for Ordination. <hi>Walo
Messalinus</hi> acknowledges it to be <hi>rem antiquissimam,</hi> a most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
thing that these two Orders, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of Bishops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
should be distinct, even in the middle, or in the beginning of
the next age after Christ. <hi>Dd. Blondel</hi> places it to be 35
years after the death of S. <hi>John.</hi> Now then Episcopacy
is confessed to be of about 1600 years continuance: and if before
this they can shew any Ordination by meer Presbyters, by any but
an Apostle, or an Apostolical man; and if there were not visibly a
distinction of Powers and Persons relatively in the Ecclesiastical
Government; or if they can give a rational account why they who
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56643:31"/>
are forced to confess the Honour and distinct Order of Episcopacy
for about 16 Ages, should in the dark interval of 35 years (in which
they can pretend to no Monument or Record to the contrary) yet make
unlearned scruples of things they cannot colourably prove; if (I
say) they can reasonably account for these things, I for my part
will be ready to confess that they are not guilty of the greatest, the
most unreasonable and inexcusable schism in the world; but else
they have no colour to palliate the unlearned crime: for will not
all wise men in the world conclude, that the Church of God which
was then <hi>Holy,</hi> not in title only and design, but practically and
materially; and persecuted, and not immerged in secular tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
could not all in one instant joyn together to alter that Form
of Church Government, which Christ and his Apostles had so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
established, and without a Divine Warrant destroy a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Institution, not only to the confusion of the Hierarchy, but to
the ruine of their own Souls? It were strange that so great a
change should be, and no good man oppose it: <hi>In toto orbe decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est;</hi>
so S. <hi>Hierom:</hi> All the world consented in the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Episcopal Order: And therefore if we had no more to
say for it, yet in prudence and piety we cannot say they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novate
in so great a matter.</p>
                  <p>But I shall enter no further upon this enquiry; only I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that it is not very many months since the Bigots of the Popish
party cryed out against us vehemently, and enquired, Where is your
Church of <hi>England,</hi> since you have no Vnity? for your Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
head of Vnity, your Bishops, are gone: And if we should be
desirous to verifie their Argument, so as indeed to destroy Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
we should too much advantage Popery, and do the most impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and most impious thing in the world. But blessed be God who
hath restored that Government, for which our late King of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
memory gave his blood: And that (methinks) should very
much weigh with all the Kings true hearted Subjects, who should
make it Religion not to rob that glorious Prince of the greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of such a Martyrdom. For my part, I think it fit to rest in
these words of another Martyr, S. <hi>Cyprian, Si quis cum Episcopo
non sit, in Ecclesia non esse:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">EP. 69.</note> He that is not with the Bishop is
not in the Church: that is, he that goes away from him, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
separates, departs from Gods Church; and whether he can
then be with God, is a very material consideration, and fit to be
thought on by all that think Heaven a more eligible good than the
interests of a Faction, and the importune desire of rule can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail.</p>
                  <p>However, I have in the following Papers spoken a few things,

which I hope may be fit to perswade them that are not infinitely
prejudiced: and although two or three good Arguments are as good as
two or three hundred, yet my purpose here was to prove the dignity
and necessity of the Office and Order Episcopal, only that it might be
as an Oeconomy to convey notice, and remembrances of the great
duty incumbent upon all them that undertake this great charge. The
Dignity and the Duty take one another by the hand, and are born
together: only every Sheep of the Flock must take care to make the
Bishops Duty as easie as it can, by Humility and Love, by Prayer
and by Obedience. It is at the best very difficult, but they who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
themselves to Government, make it harder and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
But take heed, if they Bishop hath cause to complain to God
of thee for thy perversness and uncharitable walking, thou wilt be
the loser; and for us we can only say in the words of the Prophet,
<hi>We will weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of
my people:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jerem. 9. 1.</note> But our comfort is in God: for <hi>we can do nothing
without him,</hi> but in him <hi>we can do all things:</hi> And therefore
we will pray, <hi>Domine, dabis pacem nobis, omnia enim opera
nostra operatus es in nobis:</hi> God hath wrought all our works
within us;<note place="margin">Esa. 26. 12.</note> and therefore he will give us peace, and give us his
Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord
may have free course,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 3: 1.</note> and be glorified even as it is with you;
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked
men, for all men have not Faith.</p>

The Steward that does so, and continues to do so, till his Lord find him
so doing, this man shall be blessed in his deed. [<hi>Blessed is the Servant
whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing.</hi>] Of these in order.</p>
                  <p>1. Who are these Rulers of Christs Family: for though Christ knew
it, and therefore needed not to ask; yet we have disputed it so much
and obeyed so little, that we have changed the plain hypothesis into
an intangled question. The answer yet is easie as to some part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry:
The Apostles are the first meaning of the Text; for they were
our Fathers in Christ, they begat Sons and Daughters unto God; and
were a spiritual paternity is evident: we need look no further for spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Government, because in the Paternal Rule all Power is founded;
they begat the Family by the power of the Word and the life of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and they fed this Family, and ruled it by the word of their proper
Ministry: They had the keyes of this house, the Stewards Ensign, and
they had the Rulers place; for they sat on twelve Thrones and judged
the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi> But of this there is no question.</p>
                  <p>And as little of another proposition; that this Stewardship was to
last for ever, for the power of Ministring in this Office and the Office it
self were to be perpetual: For the issues and powers of Government are
more necessary for the perpetuating the Church, than for the first
planting; and if it was necessary that the Apostles should have a rod and
a staff at first, it would be more necessary afterwards, when the Family
was more numerous, and their first zeal abated, and their native simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
perverted into arts of hypocrisie and forms of godliness, when <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
should arise, and the love of many should wax cold.</hi> The Apostles had also
a power of Ordination; and that the very power it self does denote,
for it makes perpetuity, that could not expire in the dayes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
for by it they themselves propagated a succession. And Christ
having promised his Spirit to abide with his Church for ever, and
made his Apostles the Channels, the Ministers and conveyances of it,
that it might descend as the inheritance and eternal portion of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
it cannot be imagined that when the first Ministers were gone,
there should not others rise up in the same places, some like to the first,
in the same Office and Ministry of the Spirit. But the thing is plain and
evident in the matter of fact also:<note place="margin">Epist. 73. ad Jubai.</note> 
                     <hi>Quod in Ecclesiâ nunc geritur, hoc olim
fecerunt Apostoli,</hi> said S. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> What the Apostles did at first, that
the Church does to this day, and shall do so for ever: For when S. <hi>Paul</hi>
had given to the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> rules of Government in this Family,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 14.</note>
he commands that they should be <hi>observed till the coming of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ:</hi> and therefore these authorities and charges are given to him
and to his Successors; it is the observation of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> upon the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty
of that Text, and is obvious and undeniable.</p>
                  <p>Well then, The Apostles were the first Stewards; and this Office
dies not with them, but must for ever be succeeded in; and now begins
the inquiry, who are the successors of the Apostles: for they are, they
must evidently be the Stewards to feed and to rule this Family. There
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56643:33"/>
are some that say that all who have any portion of work in the Family,
all the Ministers of the Gospel are these Stewards, and so all will be Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.
The Presbyters surely; for say they, Presbyter and Bishop is the
same thing, and have the same name in Scripture, and therefore the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
cannot be distinguished: To this I shall very briefly say two things,
which will quickly clear our way through this bush of thorns.</p>
                  <p>1. That the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> is but an honourable appellative used
amongst the Jews, as <hi>Alderman</hi> amongst us; but it signifies no order at
all, nor was ever used in Scripture to signifie any distinct company or order
of Clergy: And this appears not only by an induction in all the enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the Offices Ministerial in the New Testament,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 12. 6.</note>
where to be
a Presbyter is never reckoned either as a distinct Office,<note place="margin">Eph: 4. 11.</note> or a distinct Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;<note place="margin">1 Cor: 12. 28.</note>
but by its being indifferently communicated to all the Superior
Clergy, and all the Princes of the People.</p>
                  <p>2. The second thing I intended to say is this, that although all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Clergy had not only one, but divers common appellatives, all
being called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, even the Apostolate it self being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Deaconship<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 1. 25.</note>; yet it is evident that before the common appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were fixt into names of propriety, they were as evidently distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in their Offices and Powers, as they are at this day in their
Names and Titles.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave to <hi>Titus</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Crete</hi> a special
Commission, Command and Power to make Ordinations; and in him,
and in the person of <hi>Timothy</hi> he did erect a Court of Judicature even
over some of the Clergy, who yet were called Presbyters; <hi>against a
Presbyter receive not an accusation but before two or three witnesses:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 19.</note> there
is the measure and the warranty of the <hi>Audientia Episcopalis,</hi> the Bishops
Audience Court; and when the accused were found guilty, he gives in
charge to proceed to censures;<note place="margin">1 Tit. 11. &amp; 2 Titus 15.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>You must
rebuke them sharply, &amp; you must silence them, stop their mouths,</hi> that's S. <hi>Pauls</hi>
word; that they may no more scatter their venom in the ears and hearts
of the people. These Bishops were commanded <hi>to set in order things that
were wanting</hi> in the Churches, the same with that power of S. <hi>Paul,
[other things will I set in order when I come]</hi> said he to the Corinthian
Churches; in which there were many who were called Presbyters, who
nevertheless for all that name, had not that power: To the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it is plain in Scripture, that <hi>some would have been Apostles that were
not;</hi> such were those whom the Spirit of God notes in the Revelation;<note place="margin">Cap. 2. v. 3.</note>
and some did <hi>love preeminence</hi> that had it not, for so did <hi>Diotrephes;</hi> and
some were Judges of questions, and all were not, for therefore they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
to the Apostles at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and S. <hi>Philip</hi> though he was an
Evangelist, yet he could not give confirmation to the Samaritans whom
he had baptized, but the Apostles were sent for, for that was part of the
power reserved to the Episcopal or Apostolick Order.</p>
                  <p>Now from these premises the conclusion is plain and easie. 1. Christ
left a Government in his Church, and founded it in the persons of the
Apostles. 2. The Apostles received this power for the perpetual use
and benefit, for the comfort and edification of the Church for ever.
3. The Apostles had this Government, but all that were taken into the
Ministry, and all that were called Presbyters had it not. If therefore
this Government, in which there is so much disparity in the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and exercise and first original or it, must abide for ever; then so
must that disparity: If the Apostolate in the first stabiliment was this
eminency of power, then it must be so; that is, it must be the same in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56643:34"/>
the succession, that it was in the foundation. For after the Church is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon its Governors, we are to expect no change of Government. If
Christ was the Author of it, then as Christ left it, so it must abide for ever:
for ever there must be the Governing and the governed, the Superior
and the subordinate, the Ordainer and the ordained, the Confirmer and
he confirmed.</p>
                  <p>Thus far the way is straight, and the path is plain. The Apostles
were the Stewards and the ordinary Rulers of Christs Family by virtue
of the order and office Apostolical; and although this be succeeded to
for ever, yet no man for his now, or at any time being called a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
or Elder can pretend to it; for besides his being a Presbyter, he
must be an Apostle too; else, though he be called <hi>in partem sollicitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis,</hi>
and may do the office of assistance and under-stewardship,
yet the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Government and Rule of the Family belongs not
to him.</p>
                  <p>But then <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, who are these Stewards and Rulers over the
houshold now? To this the answer is also certain and easie. Christ hath
made the same Governors to day as heretofore; <hi>Apostles still.</hi> For though
the twelve Apostles are dead, yet the Apostolical order is not: it
is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a generative order,</hi> and begets more Apostles. Now who
these <hi>minores Apostoli</hi> are, the successors of the Apostles in that Office
Apostolical and supream regiment of souls, we are sufficiently taught in
Holy Scriptures; which when I have clearly shewn to you, I shall pass on
to some more practical considerations.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore, Certain and known it is, that Christ appointed two sorts
of Ecclesiastick persons; XII. Apostles, and the LXXII. Disciples;
to these he gave a limited commission; to those a fulness of power; to
these a temporary imployment; to those a perpetual and everlasting;
from these two societies founded by Christ, the whole Church of God
derives the two superiour orders in the sacred Hierarchy; and as Bishops
do not claim a Divine right but by succession from the Apostles; so the
Presbyters cannot pretend to have been instituted by Christ, but by
claiming a succession to the LXXII. And then consider the difference,
compare the Tables, and all the world will see the advantages of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we have; for since the LXXII. had nothing but a mission on a
temporary errand; and more then that, we hear nothing of them in
Scripture; but upon the Apostles Christ powred all the Ecclesiastical
power, and made them the ordinary Ministers of that Spirit which was
to abide with the Church for ever; the Divine institution of Bishops,
that is, of Successors to the Apostles, is much more clear then that
Christ appointed Presbyters, or Successors of the LXXII. And yet if
from hence they do not derive it, they can never prove their order to
be of Divine institution at all, much less to be so alone.</p>
                  <p>But we may see the very thing it self; the very matter of fact. S. <hi>James</hi>
the Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 19.</note> is by S. <hi>Paul</hi> called an Apostle; <hi>Other Apostles saw
I none, save</hi> James <hi>the Lords Brother.</hi> For there were some whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
call <hi>the Apostles of our Lord;</hi> that is, such which Christ made by his
Word immediately, or by his Spirit extraordinarily; and even into this
number and title, <hi>Matthias,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were accounted.
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 23.</note> But the Church also made Apostles; and these were called by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <note place="margin">Philip. 2. 25.</note> and particularly <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was
the <hi>Apostle of the Philippians;</hi> properly so (faith <hi>Primasius,</hi>) and what is

those who are now called Bishops were then called Apostles,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56643:34"/>
saith the same Father. The sense and full meaning of which argument is
a perfect commentary upon that famous prophecy of the Church, [<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead

in all Lands;</hi>]<note place="margin">Psalm 45. 16.</note> that is, not only the twelve Apostles our Fathers in Christ,

                  <p>After these plain and evident testimonies of Scripture, it will not be
amiss to say, that this great affair relying not only upon the words of
institution, but on matter of fact, passed forth into a demonstration and
greatest notoriety by the Doctrine and Practice of the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

in the words of S. <hi>Cyprian; Cogitent Diaconi quod Apostolos,</hi> id est, <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopos

                     <note place="margin">Epist. 65. ad Rogat.</note> Let the Ministers know that Apostles, that
is, the Bishops were chosen by our blessed Lord himself: and this was
so evident, and so believed, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> affirms it with a <hi>nemo ignorat,</hi>

by three Apostles. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Jude,</hi> to be despisers of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and to speak evil of Dignities; and what Government it was

                     </gap>, in the contradiction or gainsaying of <hi>Corah,</hi> who
with his company rose up against <hi>Aaron</hi> the High Priest; and excepting
these who were the vilest of men, no man within the first 300 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Christ, opposed Episcopacy. But when <hi>Constantine</hi> received the
Church into his arms, he found it universally governed by Bishops; and
therefore no wise or good man professing to be a Christian, that is, to
believe the Holy Catholick Church, can be content to quit the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Government, (that by which the whole Family of God was fed,
and taught, and ruled,) and beget to himself new Fathers and new
Apostles, who by wanting succession from the Apostles of our Lord,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56643:35"/>
have no Ecclesiastical and Derivative Communion with these fountains
of our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>If ever <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi>'s rule could be used in any question, it
is in this: <hi>Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus;</hi> That Bishops
are the Successors of the Apostles in this Stewardship, and that they
did always rule the Family, was taught and acknowledged always, and
every where, and by all men that were of the Church of God: and if
these evidences be not sufficient to convince modest and sober persons
in this question, we shall find our faith to fail in many other Articles,
of which we yet are very confident: For the observation of the Lords
day, the consecration of the holy Eucharist by Priests, the baptizing
Infants, the communicating of Women, and the very Canon of the
Scripture it self relye but upon the same probation; and therefore the
denying of Articles thus proved, is a way (I do not say) to bring in all
Sects and Heresies, (that's but little) but a plain path and inlet to Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism
and Irreligion; for by this means it will not only be impossible to
agree concerning the meaning of Scripture, but the Scripture it self,
and all the Records of Religion will become useless, and of no efficacy
or perswasion.</p>
                  <p>I am entred into a Sea of matter, but I will break it off abruptly,
and sum up this inquiry with the words of the Councel of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
which is one of the four Generals, by our Laws made the measures of
judging Heresies: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>It is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge
to bring back a Bishop to the degree and order of a Presbyter.</hi> It
is indeed a rifling the order, and intangling the gifts, and confounding
the method of the Holy Ghost; it is a dishonouring them whom God
would honour, and a robbing them of those spiritual eminencies with
which the Spirit of God does anoint the consecrated heads of Bishops.
And I shall say one thing more, which indeed is a great truth, that the
diminution of Episcopacy was first introduced by Popery; and the
Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> by communicating to Abbots, and other meer Priests,
special graces to exercise some essential Offices of Episcopacy, have
made this sacred Order to be cheap, and apt to be invaded. But then
adde this: If <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was in so damnable a condition for offering
to buy the gifts and powers of the Apostolical Order, what shall we
think of them that <hi>snatch</hi> them away, and pretend to wear them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Apostles and their Successors will or no? This is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
to belye the Holy Ghost; that is the least of it: it is rapine
and sacrilege, besides the heresie and schism, and the spiritual lye. For
the Government Episcopal, as it was exemplified in the Synagogue, and
practised by the same measures in the Temple, so it was transcribed by
the eternal Son of God, who translated it into a Gospel Ordinance: it
was sanctified by the Holy Spirit, who named some of the persons, and
gave to them all power and graces from above: it was subjected in the
Apostles first, and by them transmitted to a distinct Order of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks:
it was received into all Churches, consigned in the Records of
the Holy Scriptures, preached by the universal voice of all the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
World, delivered by notorious and uninterrupted practice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to further and unquestionable issue by perpetual succession.</p>
                  <p>I have done with the hardest part of the Text, by finding out the
persons intrusted, <hi>the Stewards of Christs Family;</hi> which though Christ
only intimated in this place, yet he plainly enough manifested in others:
The Apostles and their Successors the Bishops, are the men intrusted
with this great charge; <hi>God grant they may all discharge it well.</hi> And
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56643:35"/>
so I pass from the Officers to a consideration of the Office it self, in
the next words; <hi>Whom the Lord shall make Ruler over his Houshold, to
give them their meat in due season.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The Office it self is the Stewardship, that is Episcopacy, the Office
of the Bishop: The name signifies an Office of the Ruler indefinitely,
but the word was chosen, and by the Church appropriated to those
whom it now signifies, both because the word it self is a monition of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and also because the faithful were used to it in the dayes of <hi>Moses</hi>
and the Prophets.<note place="margin">Isa. 60.17.</note> The word is in the Prophecy of the Church, [<hi>I will

They who have tryed it, and did it conscientiously, have
found the burden so great, as to make them stoop with care and labour;
and they who do it ignorantly or carelesly, will find it will break their
bones: For the Bishops Office is all that duty which can be signified by
those excellent words of S. <hi>Cyprian; He is a Bishop or Overseer of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood,
the Ruler of the people, the Shepherd of the Flock, the Governour

of the Church, the Minister of Christ, and the Priest of God.</hi> These are

you may have it; but all that rule under him are Servants to them
that are ruled; and therefore you get nothing by it, but a great labour
and a busie employment, a careful life, and a necessity of making severe
accounts. But all this is nothing but the general measures, I cannot be
useful or understood unless I be more particular. The particulars we
shall best enumerate by recounting those great conjugations of worthy
offices and actions by which Christian Bishops have blessed and built up
Christendom; for because we must be followers of them, as they were
of Christ, the recounting what they did worthily in their Generations,
will not only demonstrate how useful, how profitable, how necessary
Episcopacy is to the Christian Church, but it will at the same time teach
us our duty, by what services we are to benefit the Church, in what
works we are to be employed, and how to give an account of our Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardship
with joy.</p>
                  <p>1. The Christian Church was founded by Bishops, not only because
the Apostles, who were Bishops, were the first Preachers of the Gospel,
and Planters of Churches, but because the Apostolical men, whom the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56643:36"/>
Apostles used in planting and disseminating Religion, were by all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
affirmed to have been Diocesan Bishops; insomuch that as S. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
witnesses, there were at the first disseminations of the faith of
Christ, many Churches who had in them no other Clergy,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. Tit. 1.</note> but a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
and his Deacons, and the Presbyters were brought in afterwards
as the harvest grew greater: But the Bishops names are known, they are
<hi>recorded in the book of Life,</hi> and <hi>their praise is in the Gospel;</hi> such were
<hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus, Clemens</hi> and <hi>Linus, Marcus</hi> and <hi>Dionysius, Onesimus</hi>
and <hi>Caius, Epaphroditus</hi> and S. <hi>James our Lords brother, Evodius</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon;</hi>
all which, if there be any faith in Christians that gave their lives
for a testimony to the faith, and any truth in their stories; and unless
we who believe <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Plutarch, Livy</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> think that
all Church story is a perpetual Romance, and that all the brave men,
the Martyrs and the Doctors of the Primitive Church, did conspire as
one man to abuse all Christendom for ever; I say unless all these impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
suppositions be admitted, all these whom I have now reckoned
were Bishops fixed in several Churches, and had Dioceses for their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                  <p>The consequent of this consideration is this: If Bishops were those
upon whose Ministry Christ founded and built his Church, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what great wisdom is required of them that seem to be Pillars:
the Stewards of Christs Family must be wise; that Christ requires: and
if the Order be necessary to the Church, wisdom cannot but be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the Order; for it is a shame if they who by their Office are Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in Christ, shall by their unskilfulness be but Babes themselves,
understanding not the secrets of Religion, the mysteries of Godliness,
the perfections of the Evangelical Law, all the advantages and disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
in the Spiritual Life. A Bishop must be exercised in Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
a man of great experience in the secret conduct of Souls, not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with an ordinary skill in making Homilies to the people, and
speaking common exhortations in ordinary cases; but ready to answer
in all secret inquiries, and able to convince the gainsayers, and to speak
wisdom amongst them that are perfect.</p>
                  <p>If the first Bishops laid the foundation, their Successors must not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preserve whatsoever is fundamental, but build up the Church in a
most holy Faith, taking care that no Heresie sap the foundation, and
that no hay or rotten wood be built upon it; and above all things, that
a most holy life be superstructed upon a holy and unreproveable Faith.
So the Apostles laid the foundation, and built the walls of the Church,
and their Successors must raise up the roof as high as Heaven. For let
us talk and dispute eternally, we shall never compose the controversies
in Religion, and establish truth upon unalterable foundations, as long
as men handle the word of God deceitfully, that is, with designs and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
artifices, and secular partialities; and they will for ever do so, as long
as they are proud or covetous. It is not the difficulty of our questions,
or the subtlety of our Adversaries that makes disputes interminable;
but we shall never cure the itch of disputing, or establish Unity, unless
we apply our selves to humility, and contempt of riches. If we will be
contending, let us contend like the Olive and the Vine, who shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
best, and most fruit; not like the Aspine and the Elm, which shall
make most noise in a wind. And all other methods are a beginning at a
wrong end. And as for the people; the way to make them conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the wise and holy rules of Faith and Government, is by reducing
them to live good lives. When the children of <hi>Israel</hi> gave themselves
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56643:37"/>
to gluttony and drunkenness, and filthy lusts, they quickly fell into
abominable idolatries; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> says, that men make shipwrack of
their Faith by putting away a good conscience; for the mystery of
Faith is best preserved <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 19:</note> in a pure conscience, saith the
same Apostle:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 9.</note> secure but that, and we shall quickly end our disputes,
and have an obedient and conformable people; but else never.</p>
                  <p>2. As Bishops were the first Fathers of Churches, and gave them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
so they preserve them in being: For without Sacraments there is
no Church, or it will be starved and dye; and without Bishops there
can be no Priests, and consequently no Sacraments; and that must
needs be a supreme Order from whence Ordination it self proceeds.
For it is evident and notorious, that in Scripture there is no Record of
Ordination, but an Apostolical hand was in it; one of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
one of the chief, one of the superior and ruling Clergy; and it is as
certain in the descending ages of the Church, the Bishop always had
that power, it was never denyed to him, and it was never imputed to
Presbyters: and S. <hi>Hierom</hi> himself, when out of his anger against <hi>John</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> he endeavoured to equal the Presbyter with the
Bishop, though in very many places he spake otherwise, yet even then
also, and in that heat, he excepted <hi>Ordination,</hi> acknowledging that to
be the Bishops peculiar. And therefore they who go about to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
Episcopacy, do as <hi>Julian</hi> did; they destroy the Presbytery and
starve the Flock, and take away their Shepheards, and dispark their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
and tempt Gods providence to extraordinaries, and put the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to hard shifts, and turn the channels of salvation quite another
way, and leave the Church to a perpetual uncertainty, whether she be
alive or dead, and the people destitute of the life of their Souls, and
their daily bread, and their spiritual comforts, and holy blessings.</p>
                  <p>The consequent of this is: If Sacraments depend upon Bishops, then
let us take care that we convey to the people holy and pure materials,
sanctified with a holy Ministry, and ministred by holy persons: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be true, that the efficacy of the Sacraments does not depend
wholly upon the worthiness of him that ministers; yet it is as true, that
it does not wholly rely upon the worthiness of the Receiver; but both
together relying upon the goodness of God, produce all those blessings
which are designed. The Minister hath an influence into the effect, and
does very much towards it; and if there be a failure there, it is a defect
in one of the concurring causes; and therefore an unholy Bishop is a
great diminution to the peoples blessing. S. <hi>Hierom</hi> presses this severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
<hi>Impiè faciunt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Cap. 2. Zeph.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c. They do wickedly who affirm, that the holy Eucharist is
consecrated by the words</hi> [alone] <hi>and solemn prayer of the Consecrator, and
not also by his life and holiness:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 1. Ep. 4.</note> And therefore S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirms, that <hi>none
but holy and upright men are to be chosen, who offering their Sacrifices wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
to God, may be heard in their prayers for the Lords people:</hi> but for
others; <hi>Sacrificia eorum panis luctus</hi> (saith the Prophet <hi>Hosea,) their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
are like the bread of sorrow, whoever eats thereof shall be defiled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This discourse is not mine but S. <hi>Cyprian's:</hi> and although his words
are not to be understood dogmatically, but in the case of duty and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet we may lay our hands upon our hearts, and consider how we
shall give an account of our Stewardship, if we shall offer to the people
the bread of God with impure hands; it is of it self a pure nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but if it passes through an unclean vessel, it loses much of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</p>
                  <p>3. The like also is to be said concerning Prayer: For the Episcopal
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56643:37"/>
Order is appointed by God to be the great Ministers of Christs Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
that is, to stand between Christ and the people in the entercourse
of prayer and blessing. <hi>We will give our selves continually to prayer,</hi>
said the Apostles, that was the one half of their employment; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a Bishop should spend very much of his time in holy prayer, and
in diverting Gods judgments, and procuring blessings to the people; for
in all times, the chief of the Religion was ever the chief Minister of
blessing. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> blessed <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> blessed
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> blessed the people; and <hi>without all controversie</hi>
(saith the Apostle) <hi>the less is blessed of the greater.</hi> But then <hi>we know
that God heareth not sinners;</hi> and it must be <hi>the effectual fervent prayer of
a righteous man</hi> that shall <hi>prevail,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore we may easily consider that a vitious Prelate is a great calamity to that Flock which he is appointed to bless and pray for.
How shall he reconcile the penitents, who is himself at enmity with
God? How shall the Holy Spirit of God descend upon the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols
at his Prayer who does perpetually grieve him, and quench his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fires, and drive him quite away? How shall he that hath not tasted
of the Spirit by contemplation, stir up others to earnest desires of Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
things? Or what good shall the people receive, when the Bishop
layes upon their head a covetous or a cruel, an unjust or an impure
hand? But therefore, that I may use the words of S. <hi>Hierom;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dial. adv. Lucifer.</note> 
                     <hi>Cum ab

condimentum sit Episcopus, &amp;c.</hi> Since it is intended that from the
Bishop grace should be diffused amongst all the people, there is not in
the world a greater indecency than a holy office ministred by an unholy
person, and no greater injury to the people, than that of the blessings
which God sends to them by the ministeries Evangelical they should be
cheated and defrauded by a wicked Steward. And therefore it was an
excellent Prayer which to this very purpose was by the Son of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach</hi>

by the Episcopal Order, as is evident in the universal Doctrine
and Practice of the Primitive Church: <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The consequent of this consideration is no other than the admonition
in my Text:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>We are Stewards of the manifold grace of God,</hi> and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of the mysteries of the Kingdom; and <hi>it is required of Stewards that
they be found faithful; that we preach the word of God in season and out
of season, that we rebuke and exhort, admonish and correct;</hi> for these God
calls <hi>Pastores Secundùm cor meum, Pastors according to his own heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 3. 15.</note>
                     <hi>which feed the people with knowledge and understanding;</hi> but they must
also <hi>comfort the afflicted, and bind up the broken heart;</hi> minister the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with great diligence, and righteous measures, and abundant cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
alwayes having in mind those passionate words of Christ of <hi>S. Peter,</hi>
If thou lovest me, <hi>feed my sheep;</hi> if thou hast any love to me, <hi>feed my lambs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And let us remember this also, that nothing can enforce the people
to obey their Bishops as they ought, but our doing that duty and charity
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56643:38"/>
to them which God requires. There is reason in these words of S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,</hi>
[<hi>It is necessary that the Church should adhere to their Bishop as
the body to the head, as plants to their roots, as rivers to their springs,
as Children to their Fathers, as Disciples to their Masters.</hi>] These
similitudes express not only the relation and dependency, but they tell
us the reason of the Duty: The Head gives light and reason to conduct
the Body; the Roots give nourishment to the Plants; and the Springs,
perpetual emanation of Waters to the Channels: Fathers teach and feed
their Children; and Disciples receive wise Instructions from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
and if we be all this to the People, they will be all that to us;
and Wisdom will compel them to submit, and our Humility will teach
them Obedience, and our Charity will invite their compliance; our
good example will provoke them to good works, and our meekness
will melt them into softness and flexibility: For all the Lords People are
<hi>Populus voluntarius,</hi> a free and willing people; and we, who cannot
compel their bodies, must thus constrain their Souls, by inviting their
Wills, by convincing their Understandings, by the beauty of fair ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the efficacy and holiness, and the demonstrations of the Spirit</p>
                  <p>This is <hi>experimentum ejus qui in nobis loquitur Christus,</hi> The experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ that speaketh in us: For to this purpose those are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
words which St. <hi>Paul</hi> spake,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 7.</note> [<hi>Remember them who have the rule over
you, whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.</hi>] There
lies the demonstration; and those Prelates who teach good life, whose
Sermons, are the measures of Christ, and whose Life is a copy of their
Sermons, these must be followed, and surely these will; for these are
burning and shining Lights: but if we hold forth false fires, and by the
amusement of evil example call the Vessels that sail upon a dangerous
Sea to come upon a Rock, or an iron Shore instead of a safe Harbour,
we cause them to make shipwreck of their precious Faith, and to perish
in the deceitful and unstable water: <hi>Vox operum fortiùs sonat quàm ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum:</hi>
A good Life is the strongest argument that your Faith is good,
and a gentle voice will be sooner entertained than a voice of thunder;
but the greatest eloquence in the world is meek spirit, and a liberal
hand; these are the two Pastoral Staves the Prophet speaks of, <hi>nognam
&amp; hovelim,</hi>

Rod, which is the last and latest remedy, and either brings to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
or consigns to ruine and reprobation.</p>
                  <p>If there were any time remaining, I could reckon that the Episcopal
Order is the Principle of Unity in the Church; and we see it is so, by the
innumerable Sects that sprang up when Episcopacy was persecuted. I
could add, how that Bishops were the cause that S. <hi>John</hi> wrote his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
that the Christian Faith was for 300 years together bravely defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Sufferings, the Prisons, and Flames, the Life and Death of
Bishop, as the principal Combatants; that the Fathers of the Church,
whose Writings are held in so great veneration in all the Christian
World, were almost all of them Bishops. I could add, That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Religion in <hi>England</hi> was principally by the Preachings and
the Disputings, the Writings and the Martyrdom of Bishops: That Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
have ever since been the greatest defensatives against Popery:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56643:38"/>
That <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> were governed by Bishops ever since they were
Christian, and under their Conduct have for so many Ages enjoyed all
the blessings of the Gospel. I could add also, That Episcopacy is the
great stabiliment of Monarchy; but of this we are convinced by a sad
and too dear bought Experience: I could therefore instead of it, say,
That Episcopacy is the great ornament of Religion; That as it rescues
the Clergy from contempt, so it is the greatest preservative of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Liberty from Ecclesiastick Tyranny on one hand (the Gentry being
little better than Servants while they live under the Presbytery), and
Anarchy and Licentiousness on the other; That it endears Obedience,
and is subject to the Laws of Princes, and is wholly ordained for the
good of Mankind, and the benefit of Souls. But I cannot stay to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
all the Blessings which have entered into the World at this door: I
only remark these because they describe unto us the Bishops Imployment,
which is, to be busie in the service of Souls, to do good in all capacities,
to serve every mans need, to promote all publick benefits. to cement
Governments, to establish Peace, to propagate the Kingdom of Christ,
to do hurt to no man, to do good to every man; that is, so to minister,
that Religion and Charity, publick Peace and Private Blessings may be in
their exaltation.</p>
                  <p>As long as it was thus done by the Primitive Bishops, the Princes and
the People gave them all honour; Insomuch that by a Decree of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the Great, the Bishop had power given him to retract the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
made by the Presidents of Provinces; and we find in the Acts of
S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> that he rescued some innocent persons from death when the
Executioner was ready to strike the fatal blow; which thing, even when
it fell into inconvenience, was indeed forbidden by <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi>
but the confidence and honour was only changed, it was not
taken away; for the condemned Criminal had leave to appeal to the
<hi>Audientia Episcopalis,</hi> to the Bishops Court. This was not any right
which the Bishops could challenge, but a reward of their Piety; and
so long as the holy Office was holily administred, the World found so
much comfort and security, so much justice and mercy, so many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
and spiritual Blessings consequent to the Ministries of that Order,
that, as the <hi>Galatians</hi> to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> men have plucked out their eyes to do
them service, and to do them honour: For then Episcopacy did that
good that God intended by it; it was a Spiritual Government, by Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Persons, for Spiritual Ends: Then the Princes and the People gave
them honours, because they deserved and sought them not; then they
gave them wealth, because they would dispend it wisely, frugally, and
charitably: Then they gave them power, because it was sure to be used
for the defence of the innocent, for the relief of the oppressed, for the
punishment of evil doers, and the reward of the virtuous: Then they
desired to be judged by them, because their Audiences or Courts did
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, they appeased all furious Sentences, and taught gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Principles, and gave merciful Measures, and in their Courts were
all Equity and Piety, and Christian Determinations.</p>
                  <p>But afterwards, when they did fall <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, into secular methods,
and made their Counsels vain by pride, and dirtied their sentences
with money, then they became like other men; and so it will be, unless
the Bishops be more holy then other men: but when our sanctity and
severity shall be as eminent as the calling is, then we shall be called to
Councels, and sit in publick meetings, and bring comfort to private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and rule in the hearts of men by a <hi>jus relationis,</hi> such as was
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56643:39"/>
between the Roman Emperors and the Senate; they courted one
another into power, and in giving honour strived to out-do each other
for from an humble wise man, no man will snatch an imployment that is
honourable; but from the proud and from the covetous every man
endeavours to wrest it, and thinks it lawful prize.</p>
                  <p>My time is now done; and therefore I cannot speak to the third part
of my text, the reward of the good Steward and of the bad; I shall
only mention it to you in a short exhortation, and so conclude. In the
Primitive Church a Bishop was never admitted to publick penance;
not only because in them every crime is ten, and he that could discern
a publick shame, could not deserve a publick honor; nor yet only because
every such punishment was scandalous, and did more evil by the example
of the crime, then it could do good by the example of the punishment;
but also because no spiritual power is higher then the Episcopal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were to be referred to the Divine judgment, which was
likely to fall on them very heavily: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: the Lord
will cut the evil Stewards asunder; he will suffer Schisms and Divisions
to enter in upon us, and that will sadly cut us asunder; but the evil
also shall fall upon their persons, like the punishment of quartering
Traitors, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> punishment with the circumstances of
detestation and exemplarity. Consider therefore what is your great
duty. Consider what is your great danger. The lines of duty I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
described; only remember how dear and pretious Souls are to
God, since for their salvation Christ gave his bloud, and therefore will
not easily lose them, whom though they had sinned against him, yet he so
highly valued; remember that you are Christs Deputies in the care of
Souls, and that you succeed in the place of the Apostles. <hi>Non est facile stare
loco Pauli, &amp; tenere gradum Petri;</hi> You have undertaken the work of S.
<hi>Paul,</hi> and the Office of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and what think you upon this account will
be required of us? S. <hi>Hierom</hi> expresses it thus. The wisdom and skill of a
Bishop ought to be so great, that his countenance, his gesture, his motion,
every thing should be vocal, <hi>ut quicquid agit, quicquid loquitur, doctrina
sit Apostolorum:</hi> that whatever he does or speaks be doctrine Apostolical.
The ancient Fathers had a pious opinion, that besides the Angel guardian
which is appointed to the guard of every man, there is to every Bishop a
second Angel appointed to him at the Consecration; and to this <hi>Origen</hi>
alludes, saying that every Bishoprick hath two Angels, the one visible
and the other invisible. This is a great matter, and shews what a precious
thing that Order and those Persons are in the eyes of God; but then
this also means, that we should live Angelick lives, which the Church
rarely well expresses by saying, that Episcopal dignity is the Ecclesiastick
state of perfection, and supposes the persons to be so far advanced in
holiness, as to be in the state of confirmation in grace. But I shall say
nothing of these things, because it may be they press too hard; but the
use I shall make of it upon occasion of the reward of the good and bad
Steward, is to remind you of your great danger. For if it be required
of Bishops to be so wise and so holy, so industrious and so careful, so
busie and so good up to the height of best examples; if they be anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Lord, and are the Husbands of the Churches; if they be the
Shepherds of the flock, and Stewards of the houshould; it is very fit
they consider their danger, that they may be careful to do their duty.
S. <hi>Bernard</hi> considers it well in his Epistle to <hi>Henry Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Sens;</hi>
If I lying in my Cell, and smoaking under a Bushel, not shining, yet
cannot avoid the breath of the winds, but that my light is almost blown
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56643:39"/>
out; what will become of my Candle, if it were placed on a candelstick
and set upon a hill? I am to look to my self alone, and provide for my
own salvation; and yet I offend my self, I am weary of my self, I am
my own scandal and my own danger; my own eye, and mine own belly,
and my own appetite find me work enough; and therefore God help
them who besides themselves are answerable for many others. <hi>Jacob</hi>
kept the Sheep of <hi>Laban;</hi> and we keep the Sheep of Christ; and <hi>Jacob</hi>
was to answer for every Sheep that was stoln, and every lamb that was
torn by the wild beast; and so shall we too, if by our fault one of Christs
Sheep perish; and yet it may be there are 100000 Souls committed to
the care and conduct of some one Shepherd, who yet will find his own
Soul work enough for all his care and watchfulness. If any man should
desire me to carry a Frigat into the Indies, in which a 100 men were
imbarqued; I were a mad man to undertake the charge without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
skill: and therefore when there is more danger, and more
Souls, and rougher Seas, and more secret Rocks, and horrible storms,
and the shipwrack is an eternal loss, the matter will then require
great consideration in the undertaking, and greatest care in the conduct.</p>
                  <p>Upon this account we find many brave persons in the first and in the
middle ages of the Church with great resolution refusing Episcopacy.
I will not speak of those who for fear of Martyrdom declined it, but those
who for fear of damnation did refuse. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> was by three rich
Cities severally called to be their Bishop, and by two to be their Arch-Bishop,
and he refused them; S. <hi>Dominicus</hi> refused four successively; <hi>S.
Thomas Aquinas</hi> refused the Archbishoprick of <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerius</hi>
would not accept of <hi>Valentia,</hi> or <hi>Ilerda;</hi> and <hi>Bernardinus Senensis</hi>
refused the Bishopricks of <hi>Sens, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> and <hi>Ferrara.</hi> They had reason;
and yet if they had done amiss in that Office which they declined, it had
been somthing more excusable; but if they that seek it be as careless in the
Office as they are greedy of the honour, that will be found intolerable.
<hi>Electus Episcopus ambulat in disco, recusans volvitur in areâ,</hi> said the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> The Bishop walks upon round and trundling stones, but
he that refuses it, stands upon a floor. But I shall say no more of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I suppose you have read it and considered it in S. <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> six
books <hi>de sacerdotio,</hi> in the <hi>Apologetie of</hi> S. <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> in the pastoral of S.
<hi>Greg. of Rome;</hi> in S. <hi>Dionysius's</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>Epistle to Demophilus;</hi> in the letters
of <hi>Epiphanius to S. Hierom,</hi> in <hi>S. Austins</hi> Epistle to <hi>Bishop Valerius,</hi> in <hi>S. Bernards</hi> life of <hi>S. Malcaby,</hi> in <hi>S. Hieroms</hi> 138. Epistle to <hi>Fabiola.</hi> These
things I am sure you could not read without trembling; and certainly, if
it can belong to any Christian, then [work out your salvation with fear
and trembling] that's the Bishops burden. For the Bishop is like a man
that is surety for his friend; he is bound for many, and for great sums;
what is to be done in this case, <hi>Solomons</hi> answer is the way: <hi>Do this now,</hi>
                     <hi>my Son, deliver thy self, make sure thy friend, give not sleep to thine eyes, nor
slumber to thine eye-lids</hi>:<note place="margin">Prov. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>4.</note> that is, be sedulous to discharge thy trust, to
perform thy charge; be zealous for souls, and careless of money; and
remember this, that even in Christs Family there was one sad example
of an Apostate Apostle; and he fell into that fearful estate merely
by the desire and greediness of money. Be warm in zeal, and indifferent
in thy temporalities: For he that is zealous in temporals, and cold in
the spiritual; he that doth the accessories of his calling by himself, and
and the principal by his Deputies; he that is present at the feast of Sheep-shearing,
and puts others to feed the flock, hath no sign at all upon him
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56643:40"/>
of a good Shepherd. <hi>It is not fit for us to leave the word of God, and to
serve tables,</hi> said the Apostles: And if it be a less worthy Office to serve
the Tables even of the poor, to the diminution of our care in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation
of Gods Word, it must needs be an unworthy employment
to leave the Word of God, and to attend the rich and superfluous fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
of our own Tables. Remember the quality of your Charges.

who are sound and whole: Preach often, and pray continually; let your
Discipline be with charity, and your Censures flow; let not Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications pass for trifles, and drive not away the fly from your brothers
forehead with a hatchet; give Counsel frequently, and Dispensations
seldom, but never without necessity or great charity; let every place
in your Diocess say, <hi>Invenerunt me vigiles,</hi> the Watchmen have found
me out, <hi>hassovelim;</hi> They that walk the City round have sought me out
and found me:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Let every one of us</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s expression is) <hi>shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Workman that shall not be ashamed; operarium inconfusibilem,</hi> mark
that, such a labourer as shall not be put to shame for his illness or his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulness,
his falsness and unfaithfulness, in that day when the great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Souls shall make his last and dreadful Visitation; For be sure,
there is not a carkase nor a skin, not a lock of wooll nor a drop of milk
of the whole Flock, but God shall for it call the Idol Shepherd to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
account: And how, think you, will his anger burn, when he shall
see so many Goats standing at his left hand, and so few Sheep at his right?
and upon inquiry shall find, that his Ministring Shepherds were Wolves
in Sheeps cloathing? and that by their ill Example, or pernicious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
their care of Money, and carelesness of their Flocks, so many
Souls perish; who if they had been carefully and tenderly, wisely and
conscientiously handled, might have shined as bright as Angels? And it
is a sad consideration to remember, how many Souls are pitifully handled
in this World, and carelesly dismissed out of this World; they are left
to live at their own rate, and when they are sick they are bidden to be
of good comfort, and then all is well; who when they are dead, find
themselves cheated of their precious and invaluable Eternity. Oh, how
will those Souls in their eternal Prisons for ever curse those evil and false
Guides! And how will those evil Guides themselves abide in Judgment,
when the Angels of wrath snatch their abused People into everlasting
Torments? For will God bless them, or pardon them, by whom so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Souls perish? Shall they reign with Christ who evacuate the death of
Christ, and make it useless to dear Souls? Shall they partake of Christs
Glories, by whom it comes to pass that there is less joy in Heaven it
self, even because sinners are not converted, and God is not glorified,
and the people is not instructed, and the Kingdom of God is not filled?
Oh no; the curses of a false Prophet will fall upon them, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56643:40"/>
of the evil Steward will be their portion; and they who destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Sheep, or neglected them, shall have their portion with Goats for
ever and ever in everlasting burnings, in which it is impossible for a man
to dwell.</p>
                  <p>Can any thing be beyond this? beyond damnation? Surely a man
would think, not: And yet I remember a severe saying of <hi>S. Gregory,
Scire debent Prelati, quod tot mortibus digni sunt, quot perditionis exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla
ad subditos extenderunt;</hi> One damnation is not enough for an evil
Shepherd; but for every Soul who dies by his evil example or pernicious
carelesness, he deserves a new death, a new damnation. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be wise and faithful, walk warily, and watch carefully, and rule di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
and pray assiduously; for God is more propense to rewards
then to punishments; and the good Steward that is wise and faithful in
his dispensation, shall be greatly blessed: But how? <hi>He shall be made
ruler over the houshold.</hi> What is that? for he is so already. True;
but he shall be much more; <hi>Ex dispensatore faciet procuratorem;</hi> God
will treat him as <hi>Joseph</hi> was treated by his Master; he was first a Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
and then a Procurator, one that ruled his Goods without account,
and without restraint: Our Ministry shall pass into Empire, our Labour
into Rest, our Watchfulness into Fruition, and our Bishoprick to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
In the mean time our Bishopricks are a great and weighty Care,
and in a spiritual sence our Dominion is founded in Grace, and our Rule
is in the hearts of the people, and our Strengths are the Powers of the
Holy Ghost, and the Weapons of our warfare are Spiritual; and the
Eye of God watches over us curiously, to see if we watch over our
Flocks by day and by night: And though the Primitive Church (as the
the Ecclesiastick Histories observe) when they deposed a Bishop from his
Office, ever concealed his Crime, and made no Record of it; yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
this, that God does and will call us to a strict and severe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
Take heed that you may never hear that fearful Sentence, <hi>I was
hungry, and ye gave me no meat.</hi> If you suffer Christs little ones to starve,
it will be required severely at your hands: And know this, that the
time will quickly come in which God shall say unto thee in the words of
the Prophet, <hi>Where is the Flock that was given thee, thy beautiful Flock?</hi>

of our Charges with joy, to the glory of God, to the edification and security
of our Flocks, and the salvation of our own Souls, in that day when the

                  </opener>
                  <p>I Ought not to dispute Your Commands for the printing my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of <hi>Obedience,</hi> left my Sermon should be <hi>protestatio
contra factum:</hi> here I Know my Example would be the best
Vse to this Doctrine, and I am sure to find no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
so great as that of Disobedience; neither can I be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that I am wise in any thing but when I obey; for then I have
the Wisdom of my Superior for my warrant, or my excuse. I
remember the saying of <hi>Aurelius</hi> the Emperor, <hi>Aequius est me tot
&amp; talium amicorum consilium, quam tot tales meam unius vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem
sequi.</hi> I could easily have pretended excuses; but that
day I had taught others the contrary, and I would not shed that
Chalice which my own hands had newly filled with Waters issuing
from the Fountains of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>My eyes are almost grown old with seeing the horrid mischiefs
which came from Rebellion and Disobedience; and I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
now be blessed with observation of Peace and Righteousness,
Plenty and Religion, which do already, and I hope shall for ever,
attend upon Obedience to the best KING and the best CHVRCH
in the World. I see no objection against my hopes, but that which
ought least of all in this case to be pretended: Men pretend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
against Obedience; expresly against S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine,
teaching us to <hi>obey for conscience sake;</hi> but to disobey for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in a thing indifferent, is never to be found in the Books of
our Religion.</p>
                  <p>It is very hard when the Prince is forc'd to say to his rebellious
Subject, as God did to his stubborn People, <hi>Quid faciam tibi?</hi>
I have tried all the ways I can to bring thee home, and what shall
I now do unto thee? The Subject should rather say, <hi>Quid me vis
facere?</hi> What will thou have me to do? This Question is the
best end of Disputations. <hi>Corrumpitur atque dissolvitur Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perantis
officium, si quis ad id quod facere jussus est, non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequio
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56643:43"/>
debito, sed consilio non considerato respondeat,</hi> said
one in <hi>A. Gellius:</hi> When a Subject is commanded to obey, and he
disputes, and says, <hi>Nay, but the other is better;</hi> he is like a
Servant that gives his Master necessary Counsel, when he requires
of him a necessary Obedience: <hi>Utilius parere edicto quam effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
consilium;</hi> he had better obey than give counsel, by how much
it is better to be profitable than to be witty, to be full of goodness
rather than full of talk and Argument.</p>
                  <p>But all this is acknowledged true in strong men, but not in the
weak; in vigorous, but not in tender Consciences; for Obedience
is strong Meat, and will not down with weak stomacks: As if in
the World any thing were easier than to obey; for we see that the
food of Children is Milk and Laws; the Breast-milk of their Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and the Commands of their Parents is all that Food and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by which they are kept from harm and hunger, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to life and wisdom. And therefore they that are weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
of all things in the World have the least reason to pretend an
excuse for Disobedience; for nothing can secure them but the
wisdom of the Laws; for they are like Children in minority, they
cannot be trusted to their own conduct, and therefore must live at
the publick charge, and the wisdom of their Superiors is their
guide and their security. And this was wisely advised by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <hi>Him that is weak in the Faith receive, but not to doubtful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputations</hi>;
that's not the way for him; Children must not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
with their Fathers and their Masters: If old men will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute,
let them look to it; that's meat for the strong indeed, though
it be not very nutritive: but the Laws and the Counsels, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
and the Doctrines of our Spiritual Rulers, are the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
by which God hath appointed Babes in Christ to become Men,
and the weak to become strong; and they that are not to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to doubtful disputations, are to be received with the arms of
Love, into the embraces of a certain and regular Obedience.</p>
                  <p>But it would be considered, That <hi>Tenderness of Conscience</hi> is
an equivocal term, and does not always signifie in a good sense:
For a Child is of tender flesh; but he whose foot is out of joint, or
hath a bile in his arm, or hath strained a sinew, is much more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
The <hi>tenderness of age</hi> is that weakness that is in the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and the new beginners: the <hi>tenderness of a bile,</hi> that is sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
indeed rather than tenderness, is of the diseased, the abused,
and the mis-perswaded. The first indeed are to be tenderly dealt
with, and have usages accordingly; but that is the same I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told; you must teach them, you must command them, you
must guide them, you must chuse for them, you must be their Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56643:43"/>
and they must comport themselves accordingly. But for
that <hi>tenderness of Conscience which is the disease</hi> and <hi>soreness
of Conscience,</hi> it must be cured by Anodynes and soft usages,
unless they prove ineffective, and that the Launcet be necessary.
But there are amongst us such tender Stomacks that cannot endure
Milk, but can very well digest Iron; Consciences so tender, that
a Ceremony is greatly offensive, but Rebellion is not; a Surplice
drives them away as a bird affrighted with a man of clouts, but
their Consciences can suffer them to despise Government, and speak
evil of Dignities, and curse all that are not of their Opinion, and
disturb the Peace of Kingdoms, and commit Sacrilegs, and account
Schism the character of Saints. The true Tenderness of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is, 1. That which is impatient of a Sin. 2. It will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
any thing that looks like it; And 3. It will not give offence.
Now since all Sin is Disobedience, 1. It will be rarely contingent
that a man in a Christian Commonwealth shall be tied to disobey, to
avoid <hi>Sin;</hi> and certain it is, if such a case could happen, yet
2. nothing of our present Question is so like a <hi>Sin,</hi> as when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to obey the Laws: To stand in a clean Vestment is not so ill
a sight as to see men stand in separation; and to kneel at the
Communion is not so <hi>like</hi> Idolatry as <hi>Rebellion</hi> is to <hi>Witchcraft.</hi>
And then 3. For the matter of <hi>giving offences,</hi> what scandal is
greater than that which scandalizes the Laws? and who is so
carefully to be observed, lest he be offended, as the KING? And
if that which offends the weak brother is to be avoided, much more
that which offends the strong: for this is certainly really criminal;
but for the other, it is much odds but it is mistaken: And when
the case is so put, between the obedient and the disobedient, which
shall be offended, and one will, I suppose there is no question but
the Laws will take more care of Subjects than of Rebels, and not
weaken them in their Duty, in compliance with those that hate the
Laws, and will not endure the Government.</p>
                  <p>And after all this, in the conduct of Government what remedy
can there be to those that call themselves Tender Consciences? I shall
not need to say that every man can easily pretend it; for we have
seen the vilest part of mankind, men that have done things so hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid,
worse than which the Sun never saw, yet pretend tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
against Ecclesiastical Laws: But I will suppose that they are
really such, that they in the simplicity of their hearts follow <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi>
and in weakness hide their heads in little Conventicles and
places of separation for a trifle; what would they have done for
themselves?</p>
                  <p>If You make a Law of Order, and in the sanction put a Clause
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56643:44"/>
of favour for tender Consciences, do not you invite every Subject
to Disobedience by impunity, and teach him how to make his own
excuse? Is not such a Law, a Law without an obligation? May
not every man chuse whether he will obey or no? and if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to disobey out of Conscience, is not he that disobeys equally
innocent with the obedient; altogether as just, as not having done
any thing without leave; and yet much more Religious and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious?
<hi>Quicunque vult</hi> is but an ill preface to a Law; and
it is a strange obligation that makes no difference between him that
obeys and him that refuses to obey.</p>
                  <p>But what course must be taken with Tender Consciences? Shall
the Execution of the Law be suspended as to all such persons?
That will be all one with the former: For if the Execution be
commanded to be suspended, the obligation of the Law by
command is taken away, and then it were better there were no Law
made. And indeed that is the pretension, that is the secret of the
business; they suppose the best way to prevent Disobedience is to
take away all Laws. It is a short way indeed; there shall then
be no Disobedience; but at the same time there shall be no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
but the Remedy is worse than the Disease; and to take
away all Wine and Strong Drink to prevent drunkenness, would
not be half so great a folly.</p>
                  <p>I cannot therefore tell what to advise in this particular, but
that every <hi>Spiritual Guide</hi> should consider who are tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
and who are weak Brethren, and use all the ways of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Prudence to instruct and to inform them, that they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in Knowledg and Spiritual Vnderstanding. But they that
will be always learning, and never come to the knowledge of the
Truth; they that will be Children of a hundred years old, and
never come to years of Discretion, they are very unfit to guide
others, and to be Curates of Souls: but they are most unfit to reprove
the Laws, and speak against the Wisdom of a Nation, when it is
confessed that they are so weak that they understand not the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Liberty which Christ hath purchas'd for them, but are
servants to a Scruple, and affrighted at a Circumstance, and in
bondage under an Indifferent Thing, and so much Idolaters of
their Sect or Opinion, as to prefer it before all their own nobler
Interests, and the Charity of their Brother, and the Peace of a
whole Church and Nation.</p>
                  <p>To You, my Lords and Gentlemen, I hope I may say as <hi>Marcus
Curius</hi> said to a stubborn young man, <hi>Non opus Vos habere ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
qui parere nesciret;</hi> the Kingdom hath no need of those that
know not how to obey. But as for them who have weak and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56643:44"/>
Consciences, they are in the state of Childhood and minority;
but then you know that a Child is never happy by having his own
humour; if you chuse for him, and make him to use it, he hath
but one thing to do; but if you put him to please himself, he is
troubled with every thing, and satisfied with nothing. We find
that all Christian Churches kept this Rule; They kept themselves
and others close to the Rule of Faith, and peaceably suffered one
another to differ in Ceremonies, but suffered no difference amongst
their own; they gave Liberty to other Churches, and gave
Laws, and no Liberty, <hi>to their own Subjects:</hi> And at this day
the Churches of <hi>Geneva, France, Switzerland, Germany, Low-Countries,</hi> tye all their people to their own Laws, but tye up no
mans Conscience; if he be not perswaded as they are, let him
charitably dissent, and leave that Government, and adhere to his
own Communion: If you be not of their mind, they will be served
by them that are; they will not trouble your Conscience, and you
shall not disturb their Government. But when men think they
cannot enjoy their Conscience unless you give them good Livings,
and if you prefer them not you afflict their Consciences, they do but too
evidently declare, that it is not their Consciences but their Profits
they would have secured. Now to these I have only this to say,
That their Conscience is to be enjoyed by the Measures of Gods
Word, but the Rule for their Estates is the Laws of the Kingdom;
and <hi>I shew you yet a more excellent way;</hi> Obedience is the best
security for both, because this is the best conservatory of Charity
and Truth and Peace. <hi>Si vis brevi perfectus esse, esto obediens
etiam in minimis,</hi> was the saying of a Saint; and the World
uses to look for Miracles from them whom they shall esteem Saints:
but I had rather see a man truly humble and obedient, than to see
him raise a man from the dead, said old <hi>Pachomius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to conclude: If weak Brethren shall still plead for Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Compliance, I hope my Lords the Bishops will consider
where it can do good, and do no harm; where they are permitted,
and where themselves are bound up by the Laws; and in all
things where it is safe and holy, to labour to bring them ease and to
give them remedy: but to think of removing the Disease by feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Humor, I confess it is a strange Cure to our present Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers.
He that took clay and spittle to open the blind eyes,
can make any thing be <hi>collyrium;</hi> but he alone can do it. But
whether any humane Power can bring good from so unlikely an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
if any man desires yet to be better informed, I desire
him, besides the calling to mind the late sad effects of Schism, to
remember that no Church in <hi>Christendom</hi> ever did it. It is neither
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56643:45"/>
the way of Peace nor Government, nor yet a proper Remedy for the
cure of a weak Conscience.</p>
                  <p>I shall therefore pray to God, That these men who separate in
simplicity may by Gods mercy be brought to understand their own
Liberty, and that they may not for ever be Babes and <hi>Neophytes,</hi>
and wax old in trifles, and for ever stay at the entrances and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
of Religion; but that they would pass <hi>in interiora domûs,</hi>
and seek after Peace and Righteousness, Holiness and Justice,
the Love of God and Evangelical Perfections; and then they
will understand how ill-advised they are who think Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in Zeal against Ceremonies, and speaking evil of the Laws.</p>
                  <p>My Lords and Gentlemen, what I said in pursuance of publick
Peace and private Duty, and some little incidences to both, I now
humbly present to You, more to shew my own Obedience than to
remind you of your Duty, which hitherto You have so well
observed in Your amicable and sweet concord of Councels and
Affections, during this present Session. I owe many Thanks to
You, who heard me patiently, willingly, and kindly; I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to please God, and I find I did not displease You: but he is the
best hearer of a Sermon who first loves the Doctrine, and then pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
it; and that You have hitherto done, very piously and very
prosperously. I pray God continue to direct Your Counsels so that
You in all things may please him, and in all things be blessed by
him, that <hi>all Generations may call You blessed</hi> Instruments of a
lasting Peace, the Restorers of the old Paths, the Patrons of the

                  <p>IN the World nothing is more easie than to say our Prayers, and to
obey our Superiors; and yet in the World there is nothing to
which we are so unwilling as to Prayer, and nothing seems so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
as Obedience: for men esteem all Laws to be Fetters,
and their Superiors are their Enemies: and when a command is
given, we turn into all shapes of excuse to escape from the imposition:
For either the authority is incompetent, or the Law it self is <hi>Statutum
non bonum,</hi> or it is impossible to be kept, or at least very inconvenient,
and we are to be reliev'd in equity; or there is a secret dispensation, and
it does not bind in my particular case, or not now; or it is but the law
of a man, and was made for a certain end; or it does not bind the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
but 'twas only for Political regards; or, if the worst happen, I
will obey passively, and then I am innocent. Thus every man snuffs up
the wind, like <hi>the wild Asses in the Wilderness,</hi> and thinks that Authority
is an incroachment upon a mans birth-right; and in the mean time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
considers that Christ took upon him our Nature that he might learn
us obedience, and in that also make us become like unto God. In his
Justice and his Mercy he was imitable before; but before the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ we could not in passive graces imitate God who was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passible:
but he was pleased at a great rate to set forward this duty;
and when himself became obedient in the hardest point, <hi>obediens usque
ad mortem,</hi> and is now become to us <hi>the Author and Finisher of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
as well as of <hi>our Faith, admonetur omnis aetas fieri posse quod ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando
factum est.</hi> We must needs confess it very possible to obey the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56643:46"/>
severest of the Divine Laws, even to dye if God commands, because it
was already done by a man; and we must needs confess it excellent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was done by God himself.</p>
                  <p>But this great Example is of universal influence in the whole matter
of Obedience: For that I may speak of that part of this Duty which can
be useful, and concerns us; Men do not deny but they must obey in all
Civil things, but in Religion they have a Supreme, <hi>God only,</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is his interpreter; and in effect every man must be the Judge
whether he shall obey or no. Therefore it is that I say, the example
of our Lord is the great determination of this inquiry: for he did obey
and suffer, according to the commands of his Superiors under whose
Government he was placed; he <hi>gave his back to the smiters, and his
cheeks to the nippers;</hi> he kept the Orders of the Rulers, and the Customs
of the Synagogues, the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Rites of the Temple; and
by so doing <hi>he fulfilled all righteousness.</hi> Christ made no distinctions in
his Obedience, but obeyed God <hi>in all things,</hi> and those that God set
over him <hi>in all things according to God,</hi> and in things of Religion most
of all; because to obey was of it self a great instance of Religion: and
if ever Religion comes to be pretended against Obedience in any thing
where our Superior can command, it is imposture: For that is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of my Text, <hi>Obedience is better than Sacrifice.</hi> Our own judgment,
our own opinion is the Sacrifice seldom fit to be offered to God, but
most commonly deserving to be consumed by fire: but take
it at the best, it is not half so good as <hi>Obedience;</hi> for that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Christ's <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and (as <hi>David</hi> said of <hi>Goliah</hi>'s sword, <hi>non est alter
talis</hi>) there is no other Sacrifice that can be half so good: and when
<hi>Abraham</hi> had lifted up his sacrificing knife to slay his Son, and so expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his obedience, God would have no more; he had the Obedience,
and he cared not for the Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>By Sacrifice here then is meant the external and contingent actions of
Religion; by Obedience is meant submission to Authority, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the command. Obedience is a not chusing our Duty, a not
disputing with our Betters, not to argue, not to delay, not to murmur;
it is not this, but it is much better; for it is <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and
<hi>Humility,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>sefulness,</hi> and I think these do <hi>reductively</hi> contain all that is
excellent in the whole conjugation of Christian Graces.</p>
                  <p>My Text is a perfect Proposition, and hath no special remark in the
words of it; but is only a great representation of the most useful Truth
to all Kingdoms and Parliaments, and Councels and Authorities in the
whole world: It is your Charter, and the Sanction of your Authority,
and the Stabiliment of your Peace, and the Honour of your Laws, and
the great defence of your Religion, and the building up, and the guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Kings Throne. It is that by which all the Societies in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth are firm: without this you cannot have a Village prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
or a Ship arrive in Harbour: It is that which God hath bound up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us by hope and fear, by wrath and conscience, by duty and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Obedience is the formality of all Vertues, and every sin is Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
There can no greater thing be said, unless you please to add,
that we never read that the earth opened and swallowed up any man
alive, but a company of rebellious disobedient people, who rose up
against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Prince of the People,<note place="margin">Nullum malum maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:56643:46"/>
My Text is instanced in the matter of Obedience to God; but yet
the case is so, that though I shall in the first place discourse of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to man, I shall not set one foot aside from the main intention of
it; because Obedience to our Superiours is <hi>really,</hi> and is <hi>accounted</hi> to be
Obedience to God, for they are sent by God, they are his Vicegerents,
his Ministers, and his Embassadors. <hi>Apostolus cujusque est quisque,</hi> say the
Jews, Every mans Apostle is himself; and <hi>he that heareth or despiseth
you,</hi> said Christ, <hi>heareth or despiseth me:</hi> And the reason is very evident,
because it is not to be expected that God should speak to us by himself,
but sometimes by Angels, sometimes by Prophets, once by his Son, and
alwaies by his Servants.</p>
                  <p>Now I desire two things to be observed.</p>
                  <p>First, We may as well perceive that God speaks to us when he uses
the ministry of men as when he uses the ministry of Angels: one is as
much declared and as certain as the other. And if it be said, a man may
pretend to come from God, and yet deliver nothing but his own errand;
that is no strange thing: but remember also that S. <hi>Paul</hi> puts this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in the case of an Angel, <hi>[If an Angel preach any other Gospel;]</hi>
and we know that many Angels come like Angels of light, who yet
teach nothing but the waies of Darkness. So that we are still as much
bound to obey our Superior as to obey an Angel: a man is <hi>paulò minor
angelis,</hi> a little lower than the Angels; but we are much lower than the
King. Consider then with what fear and love we should receive an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
and so let us receive all those whom God hath sent to us, and set
over us; for they are no less: less indeed in their Persons, but not in
their Authorities. Nay the case is nearer yet; for we are not only
bound to receive God's Deputies as God's Angel, but as God himself:
For it is the power of God in the hand of a man, and <hi>he that resists, resists
God's Ordinance.</hi> And I pray remember, that there is not only no power
greater than God's, but there is no other; for all Power is his. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of this is plain enough; I need say no more of it: It is all one
to us who commands, God, or God's Vicegerent. This was the first
thing to be observed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there can be but two things in the world required to make
Obedience necessary, the greatness of the Authority, and the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Thing. In the first you see the case can have no difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the thing it self is but one: There is but one Authority in the
world, and that is God's: as there is but one Sun whose light is diffused
into all Kingdoms. But is there not great difference in the Thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded?
Yes certainly, there is some; but nothing to warrant disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
for whatever the thing be, it may be commanded by man, if
it be not countermanded by God. For,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>It is not required that every thing commanded should of it self be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;</hi>
for God himself oftentimes commands things which have in
them no other excellency than that of Obedience. What made <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
the friend of God? and what made his offer to kill his Son to be so
pleasing to God? It had been naturally no very great good to cut the
throat of a little child; but only that it was Obedience. What excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
was there in the journeys of the Patriarchs from <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> to
<hi>Syria,</hi> from the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> into <hi>Aegypt?</hi> and what thanks could the
sons of <hi>Israel</hi> deserve that they sate still upon the seventh day of the
week? and how can a man be dearer unto God by keeping of a Feast,
or building of a Booth, or going to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or cutting off the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin
of a Boy, or washing their hands and garments in fair water?
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56643:47"/>
There was nothing in these things but the Obedience. And when our
blessed Lord himself came to his Servant to take of him the Baptism of
Repentance, alas he could take nothing but the water and the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
for, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> observes, he was <hi>nullius poenitentiae debitor,</hi> he
was indeed <hi>a just person and needed no repentance;</hi> but even so it <hi>became
him to fulfil all righteousness:</hi> but yet even <hi>then</hi> it was that the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
did descend upon his holy head, and crowned that Obedience,
though it were but a Ceremony. <hi>Obedience,</hi> you see, <hi>may be necessary,
when the Law is not so:</hi> For in these cases, God's Son, and God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
did obey in things which were made good only by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and if we do so in the Instances of humane Laws, there is nothing
to be said against it, but that what was not of it self necessary, is made so
by the Authority of the Commander and the force of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But there is more in it than so. For,</p>
                  <p>2. We pretend to be willing to obey even in things <hi>naturally not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi>
if a divine command does interpose; but if it be only a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of man, and the thing be not necessary of it self, then we
desire to be excused. But will we do nothing else? We our selves will
do many things that God hath not commanded, and may not our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
command us in many cases to do what we may lawfully do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a commandment? Can we become a Law unto our selves, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
the word and power of our Superiors also become a Law unto us?
hath God given more to a private than to a publick hand? But consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ill consequents of this fond opinion. Are all the practices of
<hi>Geneva</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> recorded in the word of God? are the triffling Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of their publick Penance recorded in the four Gospels? are all
the rules of decency, and all <hi>things that are of good report,</hi> and all the
measures of Prudence, and the laws of peace and War, and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of the Churches of God, and the lines of publick honesty, are all
these described to us by the Laws of God? If they be, let us see and
read them, that we may have an end to all questions and minute cases
of Conscience: but if they be not, and yet by the Word of God these
are bound upon us in general, and no otherwise; then it follows that
the particulars of all these, which <hi>may be</hi> infinite, and <hi>are</hi> innumerable,
yet may be the matter of humane Laws; and then are bound upon us
by the power of God put into the hands of man. The consequent is
this, that whatsoever is commanded by our Superiors according to the
will of God, or whatsoever is not against it, is of necessity to be
obeyed.</p>
                  <p>3. But what if our Princes or our Prelates command things against
the Word of God? what then? Why nothing then, but that we must
obey God and not man; there's no dispute of that. But what then
again? Why therefore sayes the Papist I will not obey the Protestant
Kings, because against the Word of God they command me to come to
Church where Heresie is preached; and I will not acknowledge the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
saith the Presbyterian, because they are against the Discipline
and Scepter of Jesus Christ; and the Independent hates Parochial meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and is wholly for a gathered Church, and supposes this to be the
practice Apostolical; and I will not bring my Child to Baptism, (saith
the Anabaptist) because God calls none but Believers to that Sacrament;
and I will acknowledge no Clergy, no Lord, no Master, saith the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
because Christ commands us to <hi>call no man Master on the earth,</hi> and
<hi>be not called of men Rabbi.</hi> And if you call upon these men to obey the
Authority God had set over them, they tell you with one voice, with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56643:47"/>
all their hearts, as far as the Word of God will give them leave; but
God is to be obeyed, and not man: and therefore if you put the Laws
in execution against them, they will obey you passively, because you
are stronger, and so long as they know it they will not stir against you;
but they in the mean time are little less than Martyrs, and you no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Persecutors.</p>
                  <p>What shall we do now? for here is evidently a great heap of disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
they all confess that Authority must be obeyed, but when you
come to the tryal, none of them all will do it, and they think they are not
bound: but because their Opinions being contrary cannot all be right,
and it may be none of them are, it is certain that all this while Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is infinitely wronged and prejudiced amongst them, when all phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick
Opinions shall be accounted a sufficient reason to despise it. I
hope the Presbyterian will join with the Protestant, and say that the
Papist, and the Socinian, and the Independent, and the Anabaptist, and
the Quaker are guilty of Rebellion and Disobedience, for all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Word of God to be on their side: and I am more sure that
all these will join with the Protestant, and say that the Presbyterian
hath no reason to disobey Authority upon pretence of their new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
concerning which they do but <hi>dream dreams,</hi> when they
think <hi>they see visions.</hi> Certain it is that the biggest part of dissenters in
the whole world are criminally disobedient; and it is a thousand to one
but that Authority is in the right against them, and ought to be obeyed.
It remains now in the next place, that we enquire what Authority is to
do in this case, and what these Sectaries and Recusants are to do; for
these are two things worth enquiry.</p>
                  <p>1. Concerning Authority: All disagreeing persons, to cover their
foul shame of Rebellion or Disobedience, pretend Conscience for their
Judge, and the Scripture for their Law: Now if these men think that
by this means they proceed safely, upon the same ground the Superior
may do what he thinks to be his duty, and be at least as safe as they.
If the Rebellious Subject can think that by God's Law he ought not to
obey; the Prince may at the same time think that by God's Law he
ought to punish him: and it is as certain that he is justly punished, as he
thinks it certain he reasonably disobeys. Or is the Conscience of the
Superior bound to relax his Laws if the Inferior tells him so? Can the
Prince give Laws to the peoples will, and can the people give measures
to the Princes understanding? If any one of the people can prescribe or
make it necessary to change the Law, then every one can; and by this
time every new Opinion will introduce a new Law, and that Law shall
be obeyed by him only that hath a mind to it, and that will be a strange
Law that binds a man only to do his own pleasure. But because the
King's Conscience is to him as sure a Rule as the Conscience of any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
Subject can be to himself, the Prince is as much bound to do
his duty in Government, as the other can be to follow his Conscience
in disagreeing; and the consequent will be, that whether the Subject
be right or wrong in the disputation, it is certain he hath the just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of Disobedience in the conclusion. If one mans Conscience can
be the measure of another mans action, why shall not the Princes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
be the Subjects measure? but if it cannot, then the Prince is not
to depart from his own Conscience, but proceed according to the Laws
which he judges just and reasonable.</p>
                  <p>2. The Superior is tied by the Laws of Christian Charity so far to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56643:48"/>
bend in the ministration of his Laws, as to pity the invincible Ignorance
and Weakness of his abused people, <hi>qui devoratur à malis Pastoribus</hi> (as
<hi>S. Hierom</hi>'s expression is) that are devour'd by their evil Shepherds:
but this is to last no longer than till the Ignorance can be cured, and the
man be taught his duty; for whatsoever comes after this looks so like
Obstinacy, that no Laws in the world judge it to be any thing else.
And then secondly, this also is to be understood to be the duty of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
only in matters of mere Opinion, not relating to Practice. For
no mans Opinion must be suffer'd to do mischief, to disturb the peace,
to dishonour the Government: not only because every disagreeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
can to serve his end pretend his Conscience, and so claim impunity
for his Villany; but also because those things which concern the good
of mankind, and the Peace of Kingdoms are so plainly taught, that no
man who thinks himself so wise as to be fit to oppose Authority, can
be so foolish as in these things not to know his duty. In other things,
if the Opinion does neither bite nor scratch, if it dwells at home in the
house of Understanding, and wanders not into the out-houses of Passion
and popular Orations, the Superior imposes no Laws, and exacts no
Obedience, and destroyes no Liberty, and gives no Restraint: This is
the part of Authority.</p>
                  <p>2. The next enquiry is, What must the dis-agreeing Subject do when
he supposes the Superiors command is against the Law of God? I answer
that if he thinks so, and thinks true, he must not obey his Superior in
that: but because most men that think so, think amiss, there are many
particulars fit by such persons to be considered.</p>
                  <p>1. Let such men think charitably of others, and that all are not fools
or mad-men who are not of the same Opinion with themselves or their
own little party. 2. Let him think himself as fallible and subject to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
as other men are. 3. But let him by no means think that every
Opinion of his is an Inspiration from God; for that is the pride and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a pretended Religion: such a man is to be cured by Physick; for
he could not enter into that perswasion by Reason or Experience, and
therefore it must enter into him by folly or the anger of God. 4. From
hence it will naturally follow, that he ought to think his Opinion to be
uncertain, and that he ought not to behave himself like the man that is
too confident; but because his Obedience is Duty, and his Duty certain,
he will find it more wise and safe and holy to leave that which is dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and pursue that which is demonstrable; to change his uncertain
Opinion for his certain Duty: For it is twenty to one but he is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in his Opinion; but if he be, it is certain that whatsoever his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
be, yet in his separation from Authority he is a sinner.</p>
                  <p>2. Every man who by his Opinion is engaged against Authority,
should do well to study his doubtful Opinion less, and Humility and
Obedience more. But you say, that this concerns not me, for my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing
is not in a doubtful matter, but I am sure I am in the right; there
are no <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>ands</hi> in my case. Well it may be so: but were it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that you did doubt? <hi>A wise man feareth</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from evil; but a fool rageth and is confident:</hi> and the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Learned man and a Novice is this, that the young fellow cryeth
out, I am sure it is so; the better learned answers, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
it may, and peradventure it is so, but I pray enquire: and he is the
best <hi>Diviner,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he is the best Judge that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
best, not he that is most confident; for, as <hi>Xenophanes</hi> said wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Man does but conjecture, but God only knows;</hi> and it is no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56643:48"/>
to a wise man to learn, and by suspecting the fallibility of things
and his own aptness to mistake, to walk prudently and safely, with an
eye to God, and an ear open to his Superior. Some men are drunk with
Phancy, and mad with Opinion: Who believe more strongly than
boyes and women? who are so hard to be perswaded as fools? and
who so readily suspect their Teachers as they who are governed by
chance, and know not the intrinsick measures of good and evil? <hi>Qui
pauca considerat de facili pronunciat;</hi> it is a little learning and not enough
that makes men conclude hastily, and clap fast hold on the Conclusion
before they have well weighed the Premises: but Experience and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
would teach us Modesty and Fear.</p>
                  <p>3. In all disputes he that obeys his Superior can never be a <hi>Heretick
in the estimate of Law,</hi> and he can never be a <hi>Schismatick in the point of
Conscience;</hi> so that he certainly avoids one great death, and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
the other. <hi>Res judicata pro veritate accipitur,</hi> saith the Law; if
the Judge have given sentence, that sentence is supposed a truth: and
<hi>Cassidor</hi> said according to the sentence of the Law, <hi>Nimis iniquum est ut
ille patiatur dispendium, qui imperium fecit alienum.</hi> Our Obedience
secures us from the imputation of evil, and Error does but seldom go
in company with Obedience: But however there is this advantage
to be gotten by Obedience; that he who prefers the sentence of the
Law before his own Opinion does do an act of great Humility, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
the grace of Modesty, and takes the best way to secure his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and the publick Peace, and pleases the Government which he
is bound to please, and pursues the excellencies of Unity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes
Charity and Godly Love: whereas on the other side, he that
goes by himself apart from his Superior, is alwayes materially a Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,
and is more likely to be deceived by his own Singularity and
Prejudice and Weakness, than by following the Guides God hath set
over him: And if he loses Truth, certainly he will get nothing else: for
by so doing we lose our Peace too, and give publick offence, and arm
Authority against us, and are scandalous in Law, and pull evil upon
our heads; and all this for a proud Singularity, or a trifling Opinion, in
which we are not so likely to be deceived, if we trust our selves less,
and the publick more. <hi>In omnibus falli possum, in obedientia non possum,</hi>
said S. <hi>Teresa,</hi> I can in every thing else, but in Obedience I can never be
deceived. And it is very remarkable in my Text, that <hi>Rebellion</hi> or
<hi>Disobedience</hi> is compared to <hi>the sin of witchcraft.</hi> Indeed it seems strange,
for the meaning of it is not only that a Rebel is as much hated by God as
a Witch, but it means that the sins are alike in their very natures: <hi>quasi
peccatum divinationis</hi> (saith the Vulgar Latine) they that disobey Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
trusting in their own Opinions, are but like Witches or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
that is, they are led by an evil spirit; pride and a lying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
spirit is their Teacher, and their answers are seldom true; for
though they pretend the Truth of God for their Disobedience, yet they
<hi>fall into the deception of the Devil,</hi> and that's the end of their soothsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And let me add this, That when a man distrusts his Superior and
trusts himself, if he misses Truth, it will be greatly imputed to him;
he shall feel the evil of his error and the shame of his pride, the reproach
of his folly and the punishment of his disobedience, the dishonour of
Singularity, and the restlesness of Schism, and the scorn of the multitude:
but on the other side, if he obey Authority, and yet be deceived, he is
greatly excused, he erred on the safer side, he is defended by the hands of
many vertues, and gets peace and love of the Congregation.</p>

                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:56643:49"/>
You see the blessings of Obedience, even in the questions and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion: but I have something more to say, and it is not only of
great use to appease the tumultuary disputations and arguings of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which have lately disturbed these Nations, but is proper to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to, and to be reduced to practice by this Honourable and High
Court of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>That which I am to say is this; You have no other way of Peace,
no better way to appease and quiet the Quarrels in Religion which have
been too long among us, but by reducing all men to Obedience, and all
questions to the measures of the Laws: For they on both sides pretend
Scripture, but one side only can pretend to the Laws: and they that
do admit no Authority above their own to expound Scripture, cannot
deny but Kings and Parliaments are the makers and proper expounders
of our Laws; and if ever you mean to have <hi>Truth and Peace kiss each
other,</hi> let no man dispute against your Laws. For did not our blessed
Saviour say, that an Oath is the end of all questions, and after deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are taken, all Judges go to sentence? What Oaths are to private
questions, that Laws are to publick. And if it be said that Laws may
be mistaken; it is true, but may not an Oath also be a Perjury? and yet
because in humane affairs we have no greater certainty, and greater than
God gives we may not look for, let the Laws be the last determination;
and in wise and religious Governments no disputation is to go beyond
them.</p>
                  <p>2. But this is not only true in Religious prudence and plain necessity,
but this is the way that God hath appointed, and that he hath blessed,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 1.</note> and
that he hath intended to be the means of ending all questions. This we
learn from S. <hi>Paul, I exhort that first of all Prayers, and Supplications, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions,
and giving of Thanks be made for all men: for Kings &amp; for all that
are in Authority:</hi> For all; for Parliaments and for Councils, for Bishops and
for Magistrates: it is for all, and for Kings above all. Well, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is all this? <hi>that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and honesty.</hi> Mark that: Kings and all that are in Authority are by
God appointed to be the means of obtaining unity and peace in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in all the true and godly worshipings of God; no Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Religion without Kings and Bishops, and those that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>3. And indeed because this is God's way of ending our Controversies,
the matter of Authority is highly to be regarded. If you suffer the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the King to be lessened, to be scrupled, to be denied in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
affairs, you have no way left to silence the tongues and hands
of gainsaying people. But so it is, the Kings Authority is appointed and
enabled by God to end our questions of Religion:<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Divinatio in labiis
Regis</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) in judicio non errabit os ejus,</hi> Divination and a
wise sentence is in the lips of the King, and his mouth shall not erre in
judgment. In all Scripture there is not so much for the Popes infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but by this it appears there is divinity in the Kings sentence: for
God gives to Kings, who are his Vicegerents, a peculiar spirit. And
when <hi>Justinian</hi> had out of the sense of <hi>Julian</hi> the Lawyer observed that
there were many cases for which Law made no provision, he adds, <hi>If
any such shall happen, Augustum imploretur remedium,</hi>

ut possit omnia quae noviter contingunt &amp; emendare &amp; componere,
&amp; modis ac regulis competentibus tradere,</hi> that the King may amend
and rule and compose every new arising question. And it is not to be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56643:49"/>
despised, but is a great indication of this Truth, that the Answers of
the Roman Princes and Judges recorded in the Civil Law are such that
all Nations of the world do approve them, and are a great testimony
how the sentences of Kings ought to be valued, even in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and questions of greatest doubt. <hi>Bona conscientia Scyphus est

Cup, in which our Lord the King divines. And since God hath blessed us
with so good, so just, so religious and so wise a Prince, let the sentence
of his Laws be our last resort, and no questions be permitted after his
judgment and legal determination. For Wisdom saith, <hi>By me Princes
rule, by me they decree justice:</hi> and therefore the spirit of the King is a
divine eminency, and is as the spirit of the most High God.</p>
                  <p>4. Let no man be too busie in disputing the laws of his Superiors, for
a man by that seldom gets good to himself, but seldom misses to do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
unto others: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, said one in <hi>Laertius.</hi>
Will a Son contend with his Father? that's not decent, though the son
speak that which is right: he may possibly say well enough, but he
does do very ill; not only because he does not pay his duty and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
fear, but because it is in it self very often unreasonable to dispute
concerning the command of our Superior, whether it be good or no;
for the very commandment can make it not only good, but a necessary
good. <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay on you no greater
burden than these necessary things,</hi> said the Council of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> and
yet these things were not necessary, but as they were commanded: to
abstain from a strangled hen or a bloody pudding could not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
be necessary; but the commandment came, authority did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and then they were made so.</p>
                  <p>5. But then besides the advantages both of the Spirit, and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Kings in matter of question, the Laws and Decrees of a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Church ought upon the account of their own advantages be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a final sentence in all things disputed. The thing is a plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<hi>Hebrews 13. 7. Remember them which have the Rule over you, who
have spoken unto you the word of God:</hi> this tells what Rulers he means;
Rulers Ecclesiastical: and what of them? <hi>whose faith follow;</hi> they must
<hi>praeire in articulis;</hi> they are not Masters of your Faith, but Guides of
it: and <hi>they that sit in Moses chair</hi> must be heard and obeyed, said our
blessed Saviour. These words were not said for nothing; and they were
nothing if their authority were nothing.</p>
                  <p>For between the laws of a Church and the opinion of a Subject the
comparison is the same as between a publick spirit and a private. The
publick is far the better, the daughter of God, and the mother of a
blessing, and alwayes dwels in light. The publick spirit hath already
passed the tryal, it hath been <hi>subjected to the Prophets,</hi> tryed and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and approved; the private is yet to be examined. The publick spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is uniform and apt to be followed; the private is various and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
as chance, and no man can follow him that hath it: for if he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
one, he is reproved by a thousand; and if he changes he may get
a shame, but no truth; and he can never rest but in the arms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of his Superior. When <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> murmured against <hi>Moses,</hi>
God told them they were Prophets of an inferior rank than <hi>Moses</hi> was;
God communicated himself to them in dreams and visions; but the
<hi>Ruach hakkodesh,</hi> the publick spirit of <hi>Moses</hi> their Prince,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> that was
higher: and what then? <hi>wherefore then</hi> (God said) <hi>were ye not afraid
to speak against my servant Moses?</hi> plainly teaching us,<note place="margin">Num. 12. 6, 7, 8</note> that where there
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56643:50"/>
is a more excellent spirit, they that have a spirit less excellent ought to
be afraid to speak against it. And this is the full case of the private and
publick spirit; that is, of a Subject speaking against the Spirit and the
Laws of the Church. In Heaven, and in the air, and in all the regions
of Spirits, the Spirit of a lower Order dares not speak against the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of an higher; and therefore for a private Spirit to oppose the publick,
is a disorder greater than is in Hell it self.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this point; Let us consider whether it were not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable mischief if the Judges should give sentence in causes of instance
by the measures of their own fancy, and not by the Laws; who would
endure them? and yet why may they not do that as well as any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick
person preach Religion, not which the Laws allow, but what
is taught him by his own private Opinion? but he that hath the Laws
on his side, hath ever something of true Religion to warrant him, and
can never want a great measure of justification: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Laws
and the Customs of the Country are the results of wise Counsels or long
experience; they ever comply with Peace and publick benefit: and
nothing of this can be said of private Religions; for they break the
Peace and trouble the Conscience, and undoe Government, and despise
the Laws, and offend Princes, and dishonour the wisdom of Parliaments,
and destroy Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Well, but in the last place, but if we cannot do what the Laws com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
we will suffer what they impose; and then all is well again. But
first, who ever did so that could help it? And secondly, this talking of
passive Obedience is but a mockery; for what man did ever say the
Laws were not good, but he also said the Punishment was unjust? And
thirdly, which of all the Recusants did not endeavour to get ground
upon the Laws, and secretly or openly asperse the Authority that put
him to pain for doing that which he calls his duty? and can any man
boast of his passive Obedience that calls it Persecution? he may think
to please himself, but he neither does or sayes any thing that is for the
reputation of the Laws: Such men are like them that sail in a storm;
they may possibly be thrown into a Harbour, but they are very sick all
the way.</p>
                  <p>But after all this I have one thing to observe to such persons, That
such a passive Obedience as this does not acquit a man before God; and
he that suffers what the Law inflicts is not discharged in the Court of
Conscience, but there is still a sinner and a debter: For <hi>the Law is not
made for the righteous, but for sinners;</hi> that is, the punishment appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Law falls on <hi>him only</hi> that hath sinned: but an offending sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
cannot <hi>with the fruit of his body pay for the sin of his Soul:</hi> when he
does evil he must suffer evil; but if he does not repent besides, a worse
thing will happen to him; for we are not tyed to obey only for wrath
but also for Conscience. <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> is only the correspondent of
<hi>wrath,</hi> but it is the <hi>active Obedience</hi> that is required by <hi>Conscience;</hi> and
whatever the Subject suffers for his own fault, it matters nothing as to
his Duty, but this also God will exact at the hands of every man that is
placed under Authority.</p>
                  <p>I have now told you the sum of what I had to say concerning Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Laws and to your own Government, and it will be to little
purpose to make Laws in matter of Religion, or in any thing else, if the
end of it be, that every man shall chuse whether he will obey or no:
and if it be questioned whether you be deceived or no, though the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
such a question is a great diminution to your Authority, yet it is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56643:50"/>
infinitely more probable that you are in the right than that the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
Subject is; because you are conducted with a publick spirit, you
have a special title and peculiar portions of the promise of Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
you have all the helps of Counsel and the advantages of delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
you have the Scriptures and the Laws, you are as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to judge according to truth as any man, you have the principal of
all capacities and states of men to assist your Consultations, you are the
most concerned for Peace, and to please God also is your biggest inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est:
and therefore it cannot be denied to be the most reasonable thing
in the world which is set down in the Law, <hi>Praesumptio est pro autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate
imponentis,</hi> the presumption of truth ought to be on your side;
and since this is the most likely way for Truth, and the most certain way
for Peace, you are to insist in this, and it is not possible to find a better.</p>
                  <p>I have another part or sense of my Text yet to handle; but because
I have no more time of mine own, and I will not take any of yours, I
shall only do it in a short Exhortation to this most Honourable Auditory,
and so conclude.</p>
                  <p>God hath put a Royal Mantle, and fastned it with a Golden Clasp, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the shoulder of the KING, and he hath given you the Judges Robe;
the King holds the Scepter, and he hath now permitted you to touch
the golden Ball, and to take it a while into your handling, and make
Obedience to your Laws to be Duty and Religion: but then remember
that the first in every kind is to be the measure of the rest; you cannot
reasonably expect that the Subjects should obey you, unless you obey
God. I do not speak this only in relation to your personal duty; though
in that also it would be considered, that all the Bishops and Ministers of
Religion are bound to teach the same Doctrines by their Lives as they
do by their Sermons; and what we are to do in the matters of Doctrine,
you are also to do in the matters of Laws; what is reasonable for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of Religion, is also the best Method for the advantages of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
we must preach by our good example, and you must govern by
it; and your good example in observing the Laws of Religion will
strangely endear them to the affections of the people. But I shall rather
speak to you as you are in a capacity of Union and of Government; for as
now you have a new Power, so there is incumbent upon you a special Duty.</p>
                  <p>1. Take care that all your Power and your Consels be employed
in doing honour and advantages to Piety and Holiness. Then you
obey God in your publick capacity, when by holy Laws and wise
Administrations you take care that all the Land be an obedient and
a religious people. For then you are Princely Rulers indeed when you
take care of the Salvation of a whole Nation. <hi>Nihil aliud est imperium nisi
cura salutis alienae,</hi> said <hi>Ammianus;</hi> Government is nothing but a care that
all men be saved. And therefore take care that men do not destroy
their Souls by the abominations of an evil life: see that God be obeyed,
take care that the breach of the Laws of God may not be unpunished.
The best way to make men to be good Subjects to the King is to make
them good Servants of God. Suffer not Drunkenness to pass with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity,
let Lust find a publick shame: let the Sons of the Nobility and
Gentry no more dare to dishonour God than the meanest of the people
shall: let baseness be basely esteemed; that is, put such Characters of
Shame upon dishonourable Crimes, that it be esteemed more against the
honour of a Gentleman to be drunk than to be kicked, more shame to
fornicate than to be caned: and for honours sake and the reputation of
Christianity, take some course that the most unworthy sins of the world
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56643:51"/>
have not reputation added to them by being the practice of Gentlemen
and persons of good birth and fortunes. Let not them who should be
examples of Holiness have an impunity and a licence to provoke God to
anger; lest it be said that in <hi>Ireland</hi> it is not lawful for any man to sin,
unless he be a person of quality. <hi>Optimus est reipublicae status,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
                     <hi>ubi nihil
deest nisi licentia pereundi;</hi> In a common-wealth that's the best state of
things, where every thing can be had but a leave to sin, a licence to be
undone.</p>
                  <p>2. As God is thus to be obeyed, and you are to take care that he be,
so God also must be honoured, by paying that reverence and religious
obedience which is due to those persons whom he hath been pleased
to honour, by admitting them to the dispensation of <hi>his blessings,</hi> and
the ministeries of <hi>your Religion.</hi> For certain it is, this is a right way
of giving honour and obedience to God. The Church is in some very
peculiar manner the <hi>portion</hi> and the <hi>called</hi> and the <hi>care</hi> of God; and
it will concern you in pursuance of your obedience to God, to take care
that they in whose hands Religion is to be ministred and conducted, be
not discouraged. For what your Judges are to the ministry of Laws,
that your Bishops are in the ministeries of Religion; and it concerns you
that the hands of neither of them be made weak: and so long as you
make Religion your care, and Holiness your measure, you will not
think that Authority is the more to be despised because it is in the hands
of the Church, or that it is a sin to <hi>speak evil of dignities,</hi> unless they be
Ecclesiastical; but that they may be reviled, and that though nothing
is baser then for a man to be a Thief, yet Sacrilege is no dishonour; and
indeed to be an Oppressor is a great and crying sin, yet to oppress the
Church, to diminish her rents, to make her beggerly and contemptible,
that's no offence; and that though it is not lawful <hi>to despise Government,</hi>
yet if it be Church-government, that then the case is altered. Take heed
of that, for then God is dishonoured, when any thing is the more despised
by how much it relates nearer unto God. No Religion ever did
despise their chiefest Ministers; and the Christian Religion gives them
the greatest honour. For honourable Priesthood is like a shower from
heaven, it causes blessings every where: but a pitiful, a disheartned, a
discouraged Clergy, waters the ground with a water-pot, here and
there a little good, and for a little while; but every evil man can destroy
all that work whenever he pleases. Take heed; in the world there is
not a greater misery can happen to any man, then to be an enemy to
God's Church. All Histories of Christendome and the whole Book of
God have sad records, and sad threatnings, and sad stories of
<hi>Corah,</hi> and <hi>Doeg,</hi> and <hi>Balaam,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> and <hi>Ananias,</hi>
and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> and of Hereticks and Schismaticks, and
sacrilegious; and after all, these men could not prevail finally, but
paid for the mischief they did, and ended their daies in dishonour,
and left nothing behind them but the memory of their sin, and the record
of their curse.</p>
                  <p>3. In the same proportion you are to take care of all inferiour Relatives
of God and of Religion. Find out methods to relieve the Poor, to
accommodate and well dispose of the cures of Souls; let not the Churches
lye wast and in ruinous heaps, to the diminution of Religion, and the
reproach of the Nation, lest the nations abroad say, that the <hi>Britans</hi> are
a kind of Christians that have no Churches: for Churches, and Courts
of Judicature, and the publick defences of an Imperial City, are <hi>res sacrae;</hi>
they are venerable in Law, and honourable in Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:56643:51"/>
But that which concerns us most is, that we all keep close to our
Religion. <hi>Ad magnas reipublicae utilitates retinetur Religio in civitatibus,</hi>
said <hi>Cicero;</hi> by Religion and the strict preserving of it, ye shall best
preserve the Interests of the Nation: and according to the precept of the
<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 16. 17.</note>Apostle, <hi>Mark them which cause divisions amongst us, contrary to the
doctrine that ye have receiv'd, and avoid them.</hi> For I beseech you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
all you that are true Protestants; do you not think that your
Religion is holy, and Apostolical, and taught by Christ, and pleasing unto
God? If you do not think so, why do you not leave it? but if you do
think so, why are ye not zealous for it? Is not the Government a part of it?
it is that which immures, and adorns, and conducts all the rest, and is
establisht in the 36. Article of the Church, in the publick Service-book,
and in the book of Consecration: it is therefore a part of our Religion,
and is not all of it worth preserving? If it be, then they which make
Schisms against this Doctrine, by the rule of the Apostle are to be avoided.
<hi>Beatus qui praedicat verbum inauditum,</hi> Blessed is he that preaches a word
that was never heard before, so said the <hi>Spanish</hi> Jesuite: but Christ <hi>said
otherwise; No man having drunk old wine straight desires new, for he saith the
old is better.</hi> And so it is in Religion, <hi>Quod primum verum,</hi> Truth is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
first: and since Episcopacy hath been of so lasting an abode, of so
long a blessing, since it hath ever combin'd with Government, and hath
been taught by that Spirit that hath so long dwelt in God's Church, and
hath now according to the promise of <hi>Jesus,</hi> that sayes <hi>the gates of hell
shall not prevail against the Church,</hi> been restored amongst us by a heap
of miracles, and as it went away, so it return'd again in the hand of
Monarchy, and in the bosome of our Fundamental Laws; suffer no evil
tongue to speak against this Truth, which hath had so long a testimony
from God, and from Experience, and from the wisdom of so many Ages,
of all your Ancestors and all your Laws, lest ye be found to speak
against God, and neglect the things that belong unto your Peace, and
get nothing by it but news and danger, and what other effects ye know
not. But <hi>Leontinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> stroak'd his old white beard and
said, <hi>When this snow is dissolved, a great deal of dirty weather will follow;</hi>

the new Religion would bring nothing but trouble and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietness:
and we have found it so by a sad experience.</p>
                  <p>4. Ye cannot obey God unless ye do Justice: for this also is better
then sacrifice, said <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 21. 3. For Christ, who is <hi>the Sun of
righteousness,</hi> is a <hi>Sun and a Shield</hi> to them that do righteously. The
<hi>Indian</hi> was not immured sufficiently by the <hi>Atlantick</hi> sea, nor the <hi>Bosphoran</hi>
by the walls of Ice, nor the <hi>Arabian</hi> by his meridian Sun; the Christian
Justice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Princes brake through all inclosures, and by
Justice set up Christs standard, and gave to all the world a testimony
how much could be done by Prudence and Valour, when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by the hands of Justice. And now you will have a great trial of
this part of your Obedience to God.</p>
                  <p>For you are to give sentence in the causes of half a Nation: and he had
need be a wise and a good man that divides the inheritance amongst
Brethren; that he may not be abused by contrary pretences, nor biassed
by the Interest of friends, nor transported with the unjust thoughts even
of a just Revenge, nor allured by the opportunities of Spoil, nor
turn'd aside by Partiality in his own concerns, nor blinded by Gold
which puts out the eyes of wise men, nor couzened by pretended zeal, nor
wearied with the difficulty of questions, nor directed by a general mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56643:52"/>
in cases not measurable by it, nor born down by Prejudice, nor abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by resolutions taken before the cause be heard, nor over-ruled by
National Interests. For Justice ought to be the simplest thing in the
world, and is to be measured by nothing but by Truth and by Laws,
and by the Decrees of Princes. But whatever you do, let not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a different Religion make you think it lawful to oppress any
man in his just rights: For Opinions are not, but Laws only, and <hi>doing
as we would be done to,</hi> are the measures of Justice: and though Justice
does alike to all men, Jew and Christian, Lutheran and Calvinist; yet
to do right to them that are of another Opinion is the way to win them;
but if you for Conscience sake do them wrong, they will hate you and
your Religion.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, as <hi>Obedience is better than Sacrtfice,</hi> so God also said, <hi>I will
have Mercy and not Sacrifice;</hi> meaning that Mercy is the best Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<hi>Perierat totum quod Deus fecerat, nisi misericordia subvenisset,</hi> said
<hi>Chrysologus;</hi> all the Creatures both of Heaven and earth would perish
if Mercy did not relieve us all. Other good things more or less, every
man expects according to the portion of his fortune: <hi>Ex clementia om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
idem sperant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> * but from Mercy and Clemency all the world alike do
expect advantages. And which of us all stands here this day, that does
not need God's pardon and the Kings? Surely no man is so much pleased
with his own innocence, as that he will be willing to quit his claim to
Mercy: and if we all need it, let us all shew it.<q>
                        <l>Naturae imperio gemimus, cum funus adultae</l>
                        <l>Virginis occurrit, vel terrâ clauditur infans,</l>
                        <l>Et minor igne rogi—</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you do but see a Maiden carried to her Grave a little before her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
marriage, or an Infant die before the birth of Reason, Nature
hath taught us to pay a tributary tear: Alas! your eyes will behold the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of many Families, which though they sadly have deserved, yet Mercy
is not delighted with the spectacle; and therefore God places a watry
cloud in the eye, that when the light of Heaven shines upon it, it may
produce a Rain-bow to be a Sacrament and a Memorial that God and the
Sons of God do not love to see a man perish. God never rejoices <hi>in the
death of him that dies;</hi> and we also esteem it undecent to have Musick
at a Funeral. And as Religion teaches us to pity a condemned Criminal,
so Mercy intercedes for the most benigne interpretation of the Laws.
<hi>You must indeed be as just as the Laws, and you must be as merciful as your
Religion:</hi> and you have no way to tye these together, but to follow the
Pattern in the Mount; do as God does, who <hi>in judgment remembers
mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude; If every one in this Honourable Assembly would join
together to promote Christian Religion in its true notion, that is, Peace
and Holiness, the love of God and the love of our Brother, Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in all its proper usefulness, and would not endure in the Nation any
thing against the Laws of the Holy <hi>Jesus;</hi> if they were all zealous for
the Doctrines of Righteousness, and impatient of Sin in your selves and
in the people, it is not to be imagined what a happy Nation we should
be. But if ye divide into parties, and keep up useless differences of
names or interests; if ye do not join in the bands of Peace, that is, the
King and the Church, Religion and the good of the Nation, you can
never hope to see a blessing to be the end of your labours. Remember
the words of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 24. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>Righteousness exalteth a Nation, but sin is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56643:52"/>
to any people:</hi> but when Righteousness is advanced in the hearts
and lives of the Nation, who shall dare to reprove your Faith, who can
find fault with your Religion?</p>
                  <p>God of his mercy grant that in all your Consultations the Word of
God may be your measure, the Spirit of God may be your guide, and
the glory of God may be your end: He of his mercy grant that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
may be your limit, and Peace may be within your walls as long as
you are there, and in all the land for ever after. But remember, that
since the honour and service of his Majesty, and the peace and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Church, the perpetuity of our fundamental Laws, publick
Justice, and the honour of all legal Authority, the advancement of
Trade, and the wealth of the Nation is your design; remember, I pray,
what warranty you have to expect all this; no less than the words of
our Blessed Saviour, but it is upon these terms, <hi>Seek ye first the Kingdom
of God, and the righteousness thereof, and all these things shall be added
to you.</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <head>To the
READER.</head>
                  <p>PEACE is so great a Blessing, and Disputations and Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
in Religion are so little friends to Peace, that I have
thought no mans time can be better spent than in proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and promotions of Peace, and consequently in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expedients, and putting periods to all contentious Learning.
I have already in a discourse before the Right Honourable the
<hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> assembled in this Parliament, prov'd that
Obedience is the best <hi>medium</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and true <hi>Religion;</hi> and
<hi>Laws</hi> are the only common term and certain rule and measure of it.
<hi>Vocatâ ad concionem multitudine, quae coalescere in popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
Unius corporis nullâ re praeterquam legibus poterat,</hi> said
<hi>Livy. Obedience to Man</hi> is the external instrument; and the
best in the World. To which I now add, that <hi>Obedience to God</hi>
is the best internal instrument; and I have prov'd it in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse.
Peace and Holiness are twin-Sisters; after which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
every man is bound to follow, and he that does not shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
see God, I concluded that the Office of a Bishop is in nothing so
signally to be exhibited as in declaring by what means these great
duties and blessings are to be acquired. This way I have here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
is an old way; for it was Christs way, and therefore it is
truth and life: but it hath been so little regarded and so seldom
taught, that when I first spake my thoughts of it in the following
words before the Little, but Excellent, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niversity of <hi>Dublin,</hi> they
consented to it so perfectly, and so piously entertained it, that
they were pleased with some earnestness to desire me to publish it
to the world, and to consign it to them as a perpetual memorial of
their duty, and of my regards to them, and care over them in my
Station. I was very desirous to serve and please them in all their
worthy desires, but had found so much reason to distrust my own
abilities, that I could not resolve to do what I fain would have
done; till by a second communication of those thoughts, though in
differing words, I had published it also to my <hi>Clergy</hi> at the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitical
Visitation</hi> of the most Reverend and Learned Lord
<hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>Armagh</hi> in my own Diocese. But when I found that
they also thought it very reasonable and pious, and joined in the
desire of making it publick, I consented perfectly, and now only
pray to God it may do that Work which I intended. I have often
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56643:55"/>
thought of those excellent words of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Discourse of <hi>Justification</hi>; [<hi rend="margQuotes">Such is the untoward consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of our Nature, that we do neither so perfectly understand
the way and knowledge of the Lord, nor so stedfastly embrace it
when it is understood, nor so graciously utter it when it is embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
nor so peaceably maintain it when it is uttered, but that
the best of us are overtaken sometime through blindness, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
through hastiness, sometime through impatience, sometime
through other passions of the mind, whereunto (God knows) we
are too subject</hi>] That I find by true experience, the best way of
<hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> is that which cures all these evils, as far as
in the World they are curable; and that is the waies of <hi>Holiness,</hi>
which are therefore the best and only way of Truth. In Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
there is no end, and but very little advantage; but the way
of godliness hath in it no Error, and no Doubtfulness. By this
therefore I hoped best to applie the Counsel of the Wise man: <hi>Stand
thou fast in thy sure Understanding,</hi>

                     <hi>in the way and knowledg
of the Lord, and have but one manner of word, and follow
the word of peace and righteousness.</hi> I have reason to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that they who desired me to publish this Discourse will make
use of it, and find benefit by it: and if any others do so too, both
they and I shall still more and more give God all thanks, and
praise, and glory.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE Ancients in their Mythological Learning tell us, that
when <hi>Jupiter</hi> espyed the Men of the World striving for
Truth, and pulling her in pieces to secure her to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
he sent <hi>Mercury</hi> down amongst them, and he with
his usual Arts dressed Error up in the Imagery of Truth,
and thrust her into the Croud, and so left them to contend still: and
though then by Contention men were sure to get but little Truth, yet
they were as earnest as ever, and lost Peace too, in their Importune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
for the very Image of Truth. And this indeed is no wonder:
but when Truth and Peace are brought into the world together, and
bound up in the same bundle of life; when we are taught a Religion by
the Prince of Peace, who is the Truth it self, to see men Contending
for <hi>this Truth</hi> to the breach of <hi>that Peace;</hi> and when men fall out, to see
that they should make Christianity their Theme, that is one of the
greatest wonders in the World. For Christianity is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
a soft and gentle Institution; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it was brought
into the World to soften the asperities of humane nature, and to cure the
Barbarities of evil men, and the Contentions of the passionate. The
Eagle seeing her breast wounded, and espying the Arrow that hurt her
to be feathered, cryed out, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the feathered Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is destroyed by their own Feathers; That is, a Christian fighting
and wrangling with a Christian; and indeed that's very sad: but wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
about Peace too; that Peace it self should be the argument of a
War, that's unnatural; and if it were not that there are many who are
<hi>homines multae religionis, nullius penè pietatis,</hi> Men of much Religion
and little Godliness, it would not be that there should be so many quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
in and concerning that Religion which is wholly made up of Truth
and Peace, and was sent amongst us to reconcile the hearts of men
when they were tempted to uncharitableness by any other unhappy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
<hi>Disputation</hi> cures no Vice, but kindles a great many, and
makes Passion evaporate into sin: and though men esteem it Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet it is the most useless Learning in the World. When <hi>Eudamidas</hi>
the Son of <hi>Archidamas</hi> heard old <hi>Xenocrates</hi> disputing about <hi>Wisdom,</hi> he
asked very soberly, If the old man be yet disputing and enquiring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> what time will he have to make use of it? Christianity
is all for practice, and so much time as is spent in quarrels about it is a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56643:56"/>
diminution to its Interest: men enquire so much what it is, that they have
but little time left to <hi>be Christians.</hi> I remember a saying of <hi>Erasmus,</hi> that
when he first read the New Testament with fear and a good mind, with a
purpose to understand it and obey it, he found it very useful &amp; very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant:
but when afterwards he fell on reading the vast differences of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,
then he understood it less than he did before, then he began <hi>not</hi>
to understand it: For indeed the Truths of God are best dressed in the
plain Culture and simplicity of the Spirit; but the Truths that men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
teach are like the reflexions of a Multiplying-glass: for one
piece of good money you shall have forty that are phantastical; and
it is forty to one if your finger hit upon the right. Men have wearied
themselves in the dark, having been amused with false fires: and instead
of going home, have wandred all night <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in untroden, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe,
uneasie wayes; but have not found out what their Soul desires.
But therefore since we are so miserable, and are in error, and have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
very far, we must do as wandring Travellers use to do, go back
just to that place from whence they wandred, and begin upon a new
account. Let us go to the Truth it self, to Christ, and he will tell us an
easie way of ending all our Quarrels: For we shall find Christianity to
be the easiest and the hardest thing in the World: it is like a secret in
<hi>Arithmetick,</hi> infinitely hard till it be found out by a right operation,
and then it is so plain, we wonder we did not understand it ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier.</p>
                  <p>Christ's way of finding out of Truth is by <hi>doing the will of God.</hi> We
will try that by and by, if possible we may find that easie and certain:
in the mean time let us consider what wayes men have propounded to
find out Truth, and upon the foundation of that to establish Peace in
Christendom.</p>
                  <p>1. That there is but one true way is agreed upon; and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
every Church of one denomination that lives under Government
propounds to you a Systeme or collective Body of Articles, and tells
you, <hi>that's</hi> the true <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> are the <hi>Church,</hi> and the peculiar
people of <hi>God:</hi> like <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> of whom one sayes, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bicunque
ipsi essent, praetexebant esse rempublicam,</hi> they supposed themselves were
the Common-wealth; and these are the Church, and out of this Church
they will hardly allow salvation: But of this there can be no end; for
divide the Church into Twenty parts, and in what part soever your lot
falls, you and your party are damned by the other Nineteen; and men on
all hands almost keep their own Proselytes by affrighting them with the
fearful Sermons of Damnation: but in the mean time here is no security
to them that are not able to judge for themselves, and no Peace for
them that are.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Others</hi> cast about to cure this evil, and conclude that it must be
done by submission to an infallible Guide; this must do it or nothing:
and this is the way of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Follow but the Pope and
his Clergy, and you are safe, at least as safe as their warrant can make
you. Indeed this were a very good way, if it were a way at all; but
it is none; for this can never end our Controversies: not only because
the greatest Controversies are about this Infallible Guide; but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
1. We cannot find that there is upon Earth any such Guide at all.
2. We do not find it necessary that there should. 3. We find that they who
pretend to be this infallible Guide are themselves infinitely deceived.
4. That they do not believe themselves to be Infallible whatever they say
to us; because they do not put an end to all their own Questions that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56643:56"/>
trouble them. 5. Because they have no peace but what is constrained
by force and Government. 6. And lastly, because if there were such a
Guide, we should fail of Truth by many other causes: for it may be
that Guide would not do his duty; or we are fallible Followers of this
infallible Leader; or we should not understand his meaning at all times,
or we should be perverse at some times, or something as bad: because
we all confess that God is an Infallible Guide, and that some way or
other he does teach us sufficiently, and yet it does come to pass by our
faults that we are as far to seek for Peace and Truth as ever.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Some</hi> very wise men finding this to fail, have undertaken to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
the differences of Christendom by a way of moderation. Thus
they have projected to reconcile the <hi>Papists</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the
<hi>Lutherans</hi> and the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> and <hi>Contra-remonstrants,</hi>
and project that each side should abate of their asperities, and pare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
something of their propositions, and joyn in Common terms and
phrases of Accommodation, each of them sparing somthing, and
promising they shall have a great deal of peace for the exchange of a little
of their opinion. This was the way of <hi>Cassander, Modrevius, Andreas
Frisius, Erasmus, Spalato, Grotius,</hi> and indeed of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth in
part, but something more heartily of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second. This device
produced the conferences at <hi>Poissy,</hi> at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> at the
<hi>Hague,</hi> at many places more: and what was the event of these? Their
parties when their Delegates returned, either disclamed their Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or their respective <hi>Princes</hi> had some other ends to serve, or they
permitted the Meetings upon uncertain hopes, and a tryal if any good
might come; or it may be they were both in the wrong, and their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
abatement was nothing but a mutual quitting of what they could
not get, and the shaking hands of false friends; or it may be it was all
of it nothing but Hypocrisie and Arts of Craftiness, and, like <hi>Lucian</hi>'s
man, every one could be a man and a Pestle when he pleased. And
the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> though under another cover, made use of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice,
but made the secret manifest and common: for at this day the
<hi>Jesuits</hi> in the Questions <hi>de auxiliis Divinae gratiae</hi> have prevailed with
the <hi>Dominicans</hi> to use their expressions, and yet they think they still
keep the sentence of their own Order. From hence can succeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but folly and a phantastick peace: This is but the skinning of
an old sore, it will break out upon all occasions.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Others,</hi> who understand things beyond the common rate, observing
that many of our Controversies and peevish wranglings are kept up by
the ill stating of the Question, endeavour to declare things wisely, and
make the matter intelligible, and the words clear; hoping by this means
to cut off all disputes. Indeed this is a very good way, so far as it can
go; and would prevail very much, if all men were wise, and would
consent to those statings, and would not fall out upon the main enquiry
when it were well stated: but we find by a sad experience that few
Questions are well stated; and when they are, they are not consented
to; and when they are agreed on by both sides that they are well stated,
it is nothing else but a drawing up the Armies in <hi>Battalia</hi> with great skill
and discipline; the next thing they do is, they thrust their Swords into
one anothers sides.</p>
                  <p>5. What remedy after all this? Some other good men have propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
one way yet: but that is a way of Peace rather than Truth; and
that is, that all Opinions should be tolerated and none persecuted, and
then all the world will be at peace. Indeed this relies upon a great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56643:57"/>
not only because Opinions cannot be forced, but because
if men receive no hurt it is to be hoped they will do none: But we find
that this alone will not do it: For besides that all men are not so just as
not to do any Injury (for some men begin the evil) besides this (I say)
there are very many men amongst us who are not content that you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them; for they will not permit you, but <hi>rule over your Faith,</hi> and
say that their way is not only true, but necessary; and therefore the
Truth of God is at stake, and all indifference and moderation is carnal
Wisdom, and want of Zeal for God: nay more than so, they preach
for Toleration when themselves are under the rod, who when they got
the rod into their own hands thought Toleration it self to be Intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Thus do the <hi>Papists,</hi> and thus the <hi>Calvinists:</hi> and for their Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they pretend Charity: They will indeed force you to come in, but
it is in true Zeal for your Soul: and if they do you violence, it is no
more than if they pull your Arm out of joint, when to save you from
drowning they draw you out of a River; and if you complain, it is no
more to be regarded than the out-cries of Children against their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
or sick men against Physitians. But as to the thing it self, the truth
is, it is better in Contemplation than Practice: for reckon all that is got
by it when you come to handle it, and it can never satisfie for the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
disorders happening in the Government; the scandal to Religion,
the secret dangers to publick Societies, the growth of Heresie, the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up of parties to a grandeur so considerable as to be able in their own
time to change the Laws and the Government. So that if the Question
be whether meer Opinions are to be persecuted, it is certainly true,
they ought not. But if it be considered how by Opinions men rifle the
affairs of Kingdoms, it is also as certain, they ought not to be made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and permitted. And what is now to be done? must Truth be for
ever in the dark, and the World for ever be divided, and Societies
disturbed, and Governments weakned, and our Spirits debauched with
Error and the uncertain Opinions and the Pedantry of talking men?
Certainly there is a way to cure all this evil; and the wise Governour of
all the World hath not been wanting in so necessary a matter as to lead
us into all Truth. But the way hath not yet been hit upon, and yet I
have told you all the wayes of Man and his Imaginations in Order to
Truth and Peace: and you see these will not do; we can find no rest
for the soles of our feet amidst all the waters of Contention and Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and little artifices of divided Schools. <hi>Every man is a lyar,</hi>
and his Understanding is weak, and his Propositions uncertain, and his
Opinions trifling, and his Contrivances imperfect, and neither Truth
nor Peace does come from man. I know I am in an Auditory of inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
persons, whose business is to study for Truth, that they may find
it for themselves and teach it unto others: I am in a School of Prophets
and Prophets Sons, who all ask <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Question, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> You
look for it in your Books, and you tug hard for it in your Disputations,
and you derive it from the Cisterns of the Fathers, and you enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the old wayes, and sometimes are taken with new appearances, and
you rejoice in false lights, or are delighted with little umbrages and peep
of Day: But where is there a man, or a Society of men, that can be at
rest in his enquiry, and is sure he understands all the Truths of God?
where is there a man but the more he studies and enquires, still he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
nothing so clearly as his own Ignorance? This is a demonstration
that we are not in the right way, that we do not enquire wisely, that
our Method is not artificial. If men did fall upon the right way, it were
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56643:57"/>
impossible so many learned men should be engaged in contrary parties
and Opinions. We have examined all wayes but one, all but God's
way: Let us (having missed in all the other) try this: let us go to God
for Truth; for Truth comes from God only, and his wayes are plain,
and his sayings are true, and his promises <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen:</hi> and if we miss
the Truth it is because we will not find it: for certain it is, that all that
Truth which God hath made necessary, he hath also made legible and
plain, and if we will open our eyes we shall see the Sun, and if <hi>we will
walk in the light, we shall rejoice in the light:</hi> only let us withdraw the
Curtains, let us remove the <hi>impediments and the sin that doth so easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
us;</hi> that's God's way. Every man must in his station do that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of duty which God requires of him, and then he shall be taught of
God all that is fit for him to learn: there is no other way for him but
this. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
have all they that do thereafter.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 111. 10.</note> And so said <hi>David</hi> of himself,
<hi>I have more understanding than my Teachers; because I keep thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note>
And this is the only way which Christ hath taught us: if you
ask, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> you must not do as <hi>Pilate did,</hi> ask the Question,
and then go away from him that only can give you an answer; for as
God is the Author of Truth, so he is the Teacher of it; and the way
to learn it is this of my Text: For so saith our blessed Lord, <hi>If any man
will do his will, he shall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God
or no.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Text is simple as Truth it self, but greatly comprehensive, and
contains a Truth that alone will enable you to understand all <hi>Mysteries,</hi>
and to expound all <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and to interpret all <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and to
search into all Secrets, all (I mean) which concern our happinesse and
our duty: and it being an affirmative hypothetical, is plainly to be
resolved into this Proposition, <hi>The way to judge of Religion is by doing of
our duty; and Theologie is rather a Divine life than a Divine knowledge.</hi> In
Heaven indeed we shall first see, and then love; but here on Earth we
must first love, and love will open our eyes as well as our hearts, and we
shall then see and perceive and understand.</p>
                  <p>In the handling of which Proposition I shall first represent to you that
<hi>the certain causes of our Errors are nothing but direct sins,</hi> nothing makes
us Fools and Ignorants but living vicious lives; and then I shall proceed
to the direct demonstration of the Article in question, that <hi>Holiness is
the only way of Truth and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. No man understands the <hi>Word of God</hi> as it ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
unless he layes aside all affections to Sin: of which because we
have taken very little care, the product hath been that we have had very
little wisdom, and very little knowledge in the wayes of God. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

said <hi>Aristotle,</hi> wickedness does corrupt a mans reasoning;
it gives him false principles and evil measures of things: the sweet Wine
that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lysses</hi> gave to the <hi>Cyclops</hi> put his eye out; and a man that hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
evil affections, and made a league with sin, sees only by those
measures. A Covetous man understands nothing to be good that is not
profitable; and a Voluptuous man likes your reasoning well enough if
you discourse of <hi>Bonum jucundum,</hi> the pleasures of the sense, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishments
of lust, the noises and inadvertencies, the mirth and songs of
merry Company; but if you talk to him of the melancholy Lectures of
the Cross, the content of Resignation, the peace of Meekness, and the
Joyes of the Holy Ghost, and of rest in God, after your long discourse
and his great silence he cries out, What's the matter? He knows not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56643:58"/>
what you mean: Either you must fit his humour, or change your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
                  <p>I remember that <hi>Arianus</hi> tells of a Gentleman that was banished from
<hi>Rome,</hi> and in his sorrow visited the Philosopher, and he heard him talk
wisely, and believed him, and promised him to leave all the thoughts of
<hi>Rome</hi> and splendors of the Court, and retire to the course of a severe
Philosopy: but before the good mans Lectures were done, there came
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, letters from <hi>Caesar</hi> to recall him home, to give him
pardon, and promise him great employment: He presently grew weary
of the good mans <hi>Sermon,</hi> and wished he would make an end, thought
his discourse was dull and flat; for his head and heart were full of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
story and new principles; and by these measures he could hear on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and he could understand.</p>
                  <p>Every man understands by his Affections more than by his Reason:
and when the <hi>Wolf</hi> in the Fable went to School to learn to spell, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
letters were told him, he could never make any thing of them but
<hi>Agnus;</hi> he thought of nothing but his belly: and if a man be very hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
you must give him meat before you give him Counsel. A mans
mind must be like your proposition before it can be entertained: for
whatever you put into a man it will smell of the Vessel: it is mans
mind that gives the Emphasis, and makes your argument to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</p>
                  <p>And upon this account it is that there are so many false Doctrines in
the only Article of Repentance. Men know they must repent, but the
definition of Repentance they take from the convenience of their own
Affairs: what they will not part with, that is not necessary to be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with, and they will repent, but not restore: they will say <hi>nollem
factum,</hi> they wish they had never done it; but since it is done, you must
give them leave to rejoice in their purchase: they will ask forgiveness
of God; but they sooner forgive themselves, and suppose that God
is of their mind: If you tye them to hard terms, your Doctrine is not
to be understood, or it is but one Doctors Opinion, and therefore they
will fairly take their leave, and get them another Teacher.</p>
                  <p>What makes these evil, these dangerous and desperate Doctrines?
not the obscurity of the thing, but the cloud upon the heart; for say
you what you will, He that hears must be the Expounder, and we can
never suppose but a man will give sentence in behalf of what he passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
loves. And so it comes to pass that, as <hi>Rabbi Moses</hi> observed, that
God for the greatest Sin imposed the least Oblation, as a she-Goat for
the sin of Idolatry; for a woman accused of Adultery, a Barly-Cake:
so do most men; they think to expiate the worst of their sins with a
trifling, with a pretended, little, insignificant repentance. God indeed
did so, that the cheapness of the Oblation might teach them to hope
for pardon; not from the Ceremony, but from a severe internal repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
But men take any argument to lessen their repentances, that they
may not lessen their pleasures or their estates, and that Repentance may
be nothing but a word, and Mortification signifie nothing against their
pleasures, but be a term of Art only, fitted for the Schools or for the
Pulpit, but nothing relative to Practice, or the Extermination of their
sin. So that it is no wonder we understand so little of Religion: it is
because we are in love with that which destroyes it; and as a man does
not care to hear what does not please him, so neither does he believe it;
he cannot, he will not understand it.</p>
                  <p>And the same is the Case in the matter of <hi>Pride;</hi> the Church hath
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56643:58"/>
extremely suffered by it in many ages. <hi>Ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

therefore turned Heretick; <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, saith the story, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
and shaked the Church; for he did not understand this Truth,
<hi>[That the peace of the Church was better than the satisfaction of his person,
or the promoting his foolish Opinion.]</hi> And do not we see and feel that at
this very day the Pride of men makes it seem impossible for many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to obey their Superiors? and they do not see what they can read
every day, that it is a sin <hi>to speak evil of Dignities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man would think it a very easie thing to understand the 13. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the <hi>Romans, Whosoever resisteth the Power, resisteth ehe Ordinance
of God:</hi> and yet we know a generation of men to whom these words
were so obscure, that they thought it lawful to fight against their <hi>King.</hi>
A man would think it easie to believe that those who were <hi>in the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying
of Corah,</hi> who rose up against the high Priest, were in a very sad
condition: and yet there are too many amongst us who are in the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying
of <hi>Corah,</hi> and think they do very well; that they are the <hi>Godly party,</hi>
and the good people of God. Why? what's the matter? In the world
there can be nothing plainer than these words, <hi>Let every soul be subject
to the higher Powers,</hi> and that you need not make a scruple who are
these higher powers, it is as plainly said, <hi>there is no power but of God;</hi>
all that are set over you by the Laws of your Nation, these are <hi>over
you in the Lord:</hi> and yet men will not understand these plain things;
they deny to do their notorious duty, and yet believe they are in the
right, and if they sometimes obey <hi>for wrath,</hi> they oftner disobey for
<hi>Conscience sake.</hi> Where is the fault? The words are plain, the duty is
certain, the Book lies open; but, alas! <hi>it is Sealed within,</hi> that is, <hi>men
have eyes and will not see, ears and will not hear.</hi> But the wonder is the
less; for we know when God said to <hi>Jonas, doest thou well to be angry?</hi>
he answered God to his face, <hi>I do well to be angry even unto the death.</hi>
Let God declare his mind never so plainly, if men will not lay aside the
evil principle that is within, their open love to their secret sin, they may
kill an Apostle, and yet be so ignorant as to <hi>think they do God good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;</hi>
they may disturb Kingdoms, and break the peace of a well-order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Church, and rise up against their Fathers, and be cruel to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and stir up the people to Sedition; and all this with a cold sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and a hot liver, with a hard heart and a tender Conscience, with
humble carriage and a proud spirit. For thus men hate Repentance,
because they scorn to confess an Error; they will not return to Peace
and Truth, because they fear to lose the good opinion of the people
whom themselves have couzened; they are afraid to be good, lest they
should confess they have formerly done amiss: and he that observes how
much evil is done, and how many Heresies are risen, and how much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
and unreasonable perseverance in folly dwells in the World upon
the stock of Pride, may easily conclude that no learning is sufficient to
make a proud man understand the truth of God, unless he first learn to
be humble. But <hi>Obedite &amp; intelligetis</hi> (saith the Prophet) obey and be
humble, leave the foolish affections of sin, and then ye shall understand.
That's the first particular: All remaining affections to sin hinder the
learning and understanding of the things of God.</p>
                  <p>2. He that means to understand the will of God and the truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
must lay aside <hi>all inordinate affections to the world.</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 14.
S. <hi>Paul</hi> complained that there was at <hi>that day a veil upon the hearts of the
Jews in the reading of the Old Testament:</hi> they looked for a Temporal
Prince to be their <hi>Messias,</hi> and their affections and hopes dwelt in secular
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56643:59"/>
advantages; and so long as that veil was there, they could not see, and
they would not accept the poor despised <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the things of the world, besides that they entangle one another,
and make much business, and spend much time, they also take up the
attentions of a mans mind, and spend his faculties, and make them
trifling and secular with the very handling and conversation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> taught their Disciples <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
a separation from the things of the body, if they would
purely find out truth and the excellencies of wisdom. Had not he lost
his labour that would have discoursed wisely to <hi>Apicius,</hi> and told him
of the books of Fate and the secrets of the other World, the abstractions
of the Soul and its brisker Immortality, that Saints and Angels eat not,
and that the Spirit of a man lives for ever upon wisdom, and holiness and
contemplation? The fat Glutton would have stared a while upon the
Preacher, and then have fallen asleep. But if you had discoursed well
and knowingly of a Lamprey, a large Mullet, or a Boar, <hi>animal propter
Convivia natum,</hi> and have sent him a Cook from <hi>Asia</hi> to make new Sawces,
he would have attended carefully, and taken in your discourses greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And so it is in the Questions and secrets of Christianity: which made
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he intended to convert <hi>Foelix,</hi> discourse first with him
about <hi>Temperance, Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Judgment to come.</hi> He began in the
right point; he knew it was to no purpose to preach <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to an intemperate person, to an Usurper of other mens rights, to
one whose soul dwelt in the World, and cared not for the sentence of
the last day. The <hi>Philosophers</hi> began their Wisdom with the meditation
of death, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> his with the discourse of the day of Judgment: to
take the heart off from this world and the amabilities of it, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
and baffle the understanding, and made <hi>Solomon</hi> himself become
a child and fool'd into Idolatry, by the prettiness of a talking woman.
Men now-a-dayes love not a Religion that will cost them dear. If
your Doctrine calls upon Men to part with any considerable part of their
estates, you must pardon them if they cannot believe you; they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it not. I shall give you one great instance of it.</p>
                  <p>When we consider the infinite unreasonableness that is in the Popish
Religion, how against common sense their Doctrine of Transubstantiation
is, how against the common Experience of humane nature is the Doctrine
of the Popes Infallibility, how against Scripture is the Doctrine of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences
and Purgatory; we may well think it a wonder that no more
men are perswaded to leave such unlearned follies. But then on the
other side, the wonder will cease, if we mark how many temporal ends
are served by these Doctrines. If you destroy the Doctrine of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
and Indulgences you take away the Priests Income, and make the
the <hi>See Apostolick</hi> to be poor; if you deny the Popes Infallibility, you
will despise his Authority, and examine his Propositions, and discover
his Failings, and put him to answer hard Arguments, and lessen his
Power: and indeed, when we run through all the Propositions of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between them and us, and see that in every one of them they
serve an end of money or of power; it will be very visible that the
way to confute them is not by learned disputations, (for we see they
have been too long without effect, and without prosperity) the men
must be cured of their affections to the World, <hi>ut nudi nudum sequantur
crucifixum,</hi> that with naked and devested affections they might follow
the naked Crucified <hi>Jesus,</hi> and then they would soon learn the truths of
God, which till then will be impossible to be apprehended. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56643:59"/>
Men (as St. <hi>Basil</hi> says) when they expound
Scripture, always bring in something of themselves: but till there be
(as one said) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a rising out from their own seats, until
they go out from their dark dungeons, they can never see the light of
Heaven. And how many men are there amongst us who are therefore
enemies to the Religion, because it seems to be against their profit? The
argument of <hi>Demetrius</hi> is unanswerable; <hi>by this Craft they get their liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:</hi>
leave them in their Livings, and they will let your Religion alone;
if not, they think they have reason to speak against it. When mens souls
are possessed with the World, their souls cannot be invested with holy
Truths. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as S. <hi>Isidor</hi> said: the Soul must be
informed, <hi>insoul'd,</hi> or animated with the propositions that you put in,
or you shall never do any good, or get Disciples to Christ. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a man cannot serve two Masters; because he cannot vigorously at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
two <hi>objects;</hi> because there can be but one soul in any living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
if the World have got possession, talk no more of your Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
shut your Bibles, and read no more of the Words of God to them,
for they cannot tell of <hi>the Doctrine, whether it be of God, or of the World.</hi>
That is the second particular: Worldly affections hinder true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
in Religion.</p>
                  <p>3. No man, how learned soever, can understand the Word of God,
or be at peace in the Questions of Religion, unless he be <hi>a Master

mingled with his nature and his Congenial infirmities of <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>desire,</hi>
he can never have any thing but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Nazianz. ad Philagrium.</note> then a
man learns well when he is a Philosopher in his Passions. Passionate men
are to be taught the first elements of Religion: and let men pretend to
as much learning as they please, they must begin again at <hi>Christs Cross;</hi>
they must learn true mortification and crucifixion of their anger and
desires, before they can be good Scholars in Christs School, or be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the more secret enquiries of Religion, or profit in spiritual
understanding. It was an excellent Proverb of the Jews, <hi>In passionibus

I have now done with the first part of my undertaking, and proved
to you that our evil life is the cause of our Controversies and Ignorances
in Religion and of the things of God. You see what hinders us from
becoming good Divines. But all this while we are but in the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Mysteries of Godliness: When we have thrown off all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to sin, when we have stripp'd our selves from all fond adherences
to the things of the world, and have broken the chains and dominion
of our Passions; then we may say with <hi>David, Ecce paratum est Cor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
Deus</hi>; <hi>My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready</hi>: then we may
say, <hi>Speak, Lord, for thy Servant heareth</hi>: But we are not yet instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It remains therefore that we inquire what is that immediate Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or Means by which we shall certainly and infallibly be led into all
Truth, and be taught the Mind of God, and understand all his Secrets;
and this is worth our knowledge. I cannot say that this will end your
Labours, and put a period to your Studies, and make your Learning
easie; it may possibly increase your Labour, but it will make it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
it will not end your Studies, but it will direct them; it will not
make Humane Learning easie, but it will make it <hi>wise unto Salvation,</hi> and
conduct it into true notices and ways of Wisdom.</p>
                  <p>I am now to describe to you the right way of Knowledg: <hi>Qui facit
Voluntatem Patris mei</hi> (saith Christ) that's the way; <hi>do God's Will, and
you shall understand God's Word.</hi> And it was an excellent saying of S.
<hi>Peter, Add to your Faith Virtue, &amp;c. If these things be in you and abound,
ye shall not be unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.</note> For in
this case 'tis not enough that all our hindrances of Knowledge are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved;
for that is but the opening of the covering of the Book of
God; but when it is opened, it is written with a hand that every eye
cannot read. Though the windows of the East be open, yet every eye
cannot behold the glories of the Sun: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
saith <hi>Plotinus;</hi> the eye that is not made Solar cannot see the Sun; the
eye must be fitted to the splendor: and it is not the wit of the man, but
the spirit of the man; not so much his head as his heart, that learns the
Divine Philosophy.</p>
                  <p>1. Now in this Inquiry I must take one thing for a <hi>praecognitum,</hi> that
every good man is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he is <hi>taught of God:</hi> and indeed unless he
teach us, we shall make but ill Scholars our selves, and worse Guides to
others. <hi>Nemo potest Deum scire, nisi à Deo doceatur,</hi> said St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
(<hi>lib. 6. cap. 13.</hi>) If God teaches us, then all is well; but if we do not
learn Wisdom at his feet, from whence should we have it? it can come
from no other Spring. And therefore it naturally follows, that by how
much nearer we are to God, by so much better we are like to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.</p>
                  <p>But this being supposed, as being most evident, we can easily proceed
by wonderful degrees and steps of progression in the Oeconomy of this
Divine Philosophy: For,</p>
                  <p>2. There is in every righteous man a new vital Principle; the Spirit
of Grace is the Spirit of Wisdom, and teaches us by secret Inspirations,
by proper Arguments, by actual Perswasions, by personal Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by Effects and Energies: and as the Soul of a man is the cause of
all his vital Operations, so is the Spirit of God the Life of that Life,
and the cause of all Actions and Productions Spiritual: And the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of this is what St. <hi>John</hi> tells us of, <hi>Ye have received the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction
from above, and that annointing teacheth you all things</hi>:<note place="margin">1 John 2. 27.</note> All things of
some one kind; that is, certainly, <hi>all things that pertain to life and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi>;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56643:60"/>
all that by which a <hi>man</hi> is wise and happy. We see this by
common experience. Unless the Soul have a new Life put into it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
there be a vital Principle within, unless the Spirit of Life be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former
of the Spirit of the Man, the Word of God will be as dead in the
operation as the Body in its powers and possibilities. <hi>Sol &amp; Homo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant
hominem,</hi> saith our Philosophy: A Man alone does not beget a
Man, but a Man and the Sun; for without the influence of the Celestial
Bodies all natural Actions are ineffective: and so it is in the operations
of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Which Principle divers Phanaticks, both among us and in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> misunderstanding, look for new Revelations, and expect to be
conducted by Ecstasie, and will not pray but in a transfiguration, and
live upon raptures and extravagant expectations, and separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the conversation of men by affectations, by new measures
and singularities, and destroy Order, and despise Government, and live
upon illiterate Phantasms and ignorant Discourses. These men do
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>they belie the Holy Ghost:</hi> For the Spirit of God
makes men wise; it is an evil Spirit that makes them Fools. The Spirit
of God makes us <hi>Wise unto Salvation;</hi> it does not spend its holy Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
in disguises and convulsions of the Understanding: Gods Spirit does
not destroy Reason, but heightens it; he never disorders the Beauties
of Government, but is a God of Order; it is the Spirit of Humility,
and teaches no Pride; he is to be found in Churches and Pulpits, upon
Altars, and in the Doctors Chairs; not in Conventicles, and mutinous
corners of a House: he goes in company with his own Ordinances, and
makes progressions by the measures of life; his infusions are just as our
acquisitions, and his Graces pursue the methods of Nature: that which
was imperfect he leads on to perfection, and that which was weak he
makes strong: he opens the heart, not to receive murmurs, or to attend
to secret whispers, but to hear the word of God; and then he opens the
heart, and creates a new one; and without this new creation, this new
principle of life, we may hear the word of God, but we can never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it; we hear the sound, but are never the better; unless there
be in our hearts a secret conviction by the Spirit of God, the Gospel it
self is a dead Letter, and worketh not in us the light and righteousness of
God.</p>
                  <p>Do not we see this by daily experience? Even those things which a
good man and an evil man know, they do not know them both alike. A
wicked man does know that Good is lovely, and Sin is of an evil and
destructive nature; and when he is reproved, he is convinced; and when
he is observed, he is ashamed; and when he has done, he is unsatisfied; and
when he pursues his sin, he does it in the dark: Tell him he shall die,
and he sighs deeply, but he knows it as well as you: Proceed, and say,
that after death comes Judgment, and the poor man believes and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
he knows that God is angry with him; and if you tell him that
for ought he knows he may be in Hell to morrow, he knows that it is an
intolerable truth, but it is also undeniable: And yet after all this, he
runs to commit his sin with as certain an event and resolution as if he
knew no Argument against it: These notices of things terrible and true
pass through his Understanding as an Eagle through the Air; as long as
her flight lasted the air was shaken, but there remains no path behind her.</p>
                  <p>Now since at the same time we see other persons, not so learned it may
be, not so much versed in Scriptures, yet they say a thing is good and
lay hold of it; they believe glorious things of Heaven, and they live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56643:61"/>
as men that believe themselves; half a word is enough to
make them understand; a nod is a sufficient reproof; the crowing of a
Cock, the singing of a Lark, the dawning of the day, and the washing
their hands, are to them competent memorials of Religion, and warnings
of their duty. What is the reason of this difference? They both read
the Scriptures, they read and hear the same Sermons, they have capable
Understandings, they both believe what they hear and what they read,
and yet the event is vastly different. The reason is that which I am now
speaking of; the one understands by one Principle, the other by another;
the one understands by Nature, and the other by Grace; the one by
Humane Learning, and the other by Divine; the one reads the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
without, and the other within; the one understands as a Son of
Man, the other as a Son of God; the one perceives by the proportions
of the world, and the other by the measures of the Spirit; the one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
by Reason, and the other by Love; and therefore he does not
only understand the Sermons of the Spirit, and perceives their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but he pierces deeper, and knows the meaning of that meaning;
that is, the secret of the Spirit, that which is spiritually discerned, that
which gives life to the Proposition, and activity to the Soul. And the
reason is, because he hath a Divine Principle within him, and a new Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
that is plainly, he hath Love, and that's more than Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
as was rarely well observed by S. <hi>Paul, Knowledge puffeth up, but
Charity edifieth;</hi> that is, Charity makes the best Scholars. No Sermons
can edifie you, no Scriptures can build you up a holy Building to God,
unless the Love of God be in your hearts, and <hi>purifie your Souls from all
filthiness of the Flesh and Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But so it is in the regions of Stars, where a vast body of Fire is so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by excentrick motions, that it looks as if Nature had parted them
into Orbs and round shells of plain and purest materials: But where the
cause is simple, and the matter without variety, the motions must be
uniform; and in Heaven we should either espy no motion, or no variety.
But God, who designed the Heavens to be the causes of all changes and
motions here below, hath placed his Angels in their houses of light, and
given to every one of his appointed Officers a portion of the fiery mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to circumagitate and roll; and now the wonder ceases: for if it be
enquired why this part of the fire runs Eastward, and the other to the
South, they being both indifferent to either, it is because an Angel of
God sits in the Centre, and makes the same matter turn, not by the bent
of its own mobility and inclination, but in order to the needs of Man,
and the great purposes of God: And so it is in the Understandings of
Men; when they all receive the same Notions, and are taught by the
same Master, and give full consent to all the Propositions, and can of
themselves have nothing to distinguish them in the events, it is because
God has sent his Divine Spirit, and kindles a new fire, and creates a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
capacity, and applies the Actives to the Passives, and blesses their
operation; For there is in the heart of man such a dead sea, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition
to holy flames, like as in the cold Rivers in the North, so as
the fires will not burn them, and the Sun it self will never warm them,
till Gods holy Spirit does from the Temple of the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> bring
a holy flame, and make it shine and burn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Natural man</hi> (saith the holy Apostle) <hi>cannot preceive the things of
the Spirit;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>they are foolishness unto him;</hi> for <hi>they are spiritually discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi>
For he that discourses of things by the measures of sense, thinks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
good but that which is delicious to the palate, or pleases the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56643:61"/>
part of Man; and therefore while he estimates the secrets of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by such measures, they must needs seem as insipid as Cork, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condited
Mushrom; for they have nothing at all of that in their consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
A voluptuous person is like the Dogs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> so fill'd with the
deliciousness of Plants that grow in every furrow and hedge, that they
can never keep the scent of their Game. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, said St. <hi>Chrysostom:</hi> The fire and water can never
mingle; so neither can sensuality, and the watchfulness and wise discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Spirit. <hi>Pilato interroganti de veritate, Christus non respondit;</hi>
When the wicked Governour asked of Christ concerning Truth, Christ
gave him no answer: He was not fit to hear it.</p>
                  <p>He therefore who so understands the Words of God, that he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believes but loves the Proposition; he who consents with all his
heart, and being convinc'd of the truth does also apprehend the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
and obeys the precept, and delights in the discovery, and lays his
hand upon his heart, and reduces the notices of things to the practice of
duty; he who dares trust his proposition, and drives it on to the utmost
issue, resolving to go after it whithersoever it can invite him; this
Man walks in the Spirit; at least thus far he is gone towards it; his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is brought <hi>in obsequium Christi,</hi> into the obedience of Christ.
This is a <hi>loving God with all our mind;</hi> and whatever goes less than this,
is but Memory, and not Understanding; or else such notice of things by
which a man is neither the wiser nor the better.</p>
                  <p>3. Sometimes God gives to his choicest, his most elect and precious
Servants, a knowledge even of secret things, which he communicates
not to others. We finde it greatly remark'd in the case of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen.
18. 17. <hi>And the Lord said, Shall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>that thing that I
do?</hi> Why not from <hi>Abraham?</hi> God tells us, <hi>ver. 19. For I know him, that
he will command his Children and his Houshold after him, and they shall
keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.</hi> And though this
be irregular and infrequent, yet it is a reward of their piety, and the
proper increase also of the spiritual man. We find this spoken by God to
<hi>Daniel,</hi> and promised to be the lot of the righteous man in the days of the
<hi>Messias;</hi> Dan. 12. 10. <hi>Many shall be purified, and made white, and tryed; but
the wicked shall do wickedly:</hi> and what then? <hi>None of the wicked shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
but the wise shall understand.</hi> Where besides that the wise man
and the wicked are opposed, plainly signifying that the wicked man is a
Fool and an Ignorant; it is plainly said that <hi>None of the wicked shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand</hi>
the wisdom and mysteriousness of the Kingdom of the <hi>Messias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. A <hi>good life</hi> is the best way to understand Wisdom and Religion,
because by the experiences and relishes of Religion there is conveyed
to them such a sweetness, to which all wicked men are strangers: there is
in the things of God to them which practise them a deliciousness that
makes us love them, and that love admits us into Gods Cabinet, and
strangely clarifies the Understanding by the purification of the Heart.
For when our Reason is raised up by the Spirit of Christ, it is turned
quickly into experience; when our Faith relies upon the Principles of
Christ, it is changed into Vision; and so long as we know God only in the
ways of man, by contentious Learning, by Arguing and Dispute, we see
nothing but the shadow of him, and in that shadow we meet with many
dark appearances, little certainty, and much conjecture: But when
we know him <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, with the eyes of holiness, and the
intuition of gracious experiences, with a quiet spirit and the peace of
Enjoyment; then we shall hear what we never heard, and see what our
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56643:62"/>
eyes never saw; then the mysteries of Godliness shall be opened unto
us, and clear as the windows of the morning: And this is rarely well
expressed by the Apostle,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>If we stand up from the dead and awake from
sleep, then Christ shall give us light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For although the Scriptures themselves are written by the Spirit of
God, yet they are written within and without: and besides the light
that shines upon the face of them, unless there be a light shining with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our hearts, unfolding the leaves, and interpreting the mysterious sense
of the Spirit, convincing our Consciences and preaching to our hearts;
to look for Christ in the leaves of the Gospel, is to look for the living
amongst the dead. There is a life in them, but that life is (according to
S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s expression) <hi>hid with Christ in God:</hi> and unless the Spirit of God
be the <hi>Promo-condus,</hi> we shall never draw it forth.</p>
                  <p>Humane Learning brings excellent ministeries towards this: it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
useful for the reproof of Heresies, for the detection of Fallacies,
for the Letter of the Scripture, for Collateral testimonies, for exterior
advantages; but there is something beyond this, that <hi>humane</hi> Learning
without the addition of <hi>Divine</hi> can never reach. <hi>Moses</hi> was learned in
all the Learning of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and the holy men of God contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated
the glories of God in the admirable order, motion and influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Heaven: but besides all this, they were taught of God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
far beyond these prettinesses. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> read <hi>Moses</hi>'s Books, and
so did <hi>Plato;</hi> and yet they became not Proselytes of the Religion,
though they were learned Scholars of such a Master. The reason is,
because that which they drew forth from thence was not the life and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
of it.
<q>Tradidit arcano quodcunque Volumine Moses.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a secret in these Books, which few men, none but the Godly,
did understand: and though much of this secret is made manifest in
the Gospel, yet even here also there is a <hi>Letter</hi> and there is a <hi>Spirit:</hi>
still there is a reserve for Gods secret ones, even all those deep myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which the old Testament covered in Figures, and Stories, and
Names, and Prophesies, and which Christ hath, and by his Spirit will
yet reveal more plainly to all that will understand them by their proper
measures. For although the Gospel is infinitely more legible and plain
than the obscurer Leaves of the Law, yet there is a Seal upon them
also; <hi>which Seal no man shall open but he that is worthy.</hi> We may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
something of it by the three Children of the Captivity; they
were all skill'd in all the wisdom of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> and so was <hi>Daniel:</hi>
but there was something beyond that in him; <hi>the wisdom of the most
high God was in him,</hi> and that taught him a learning beyond his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>In all Scripture there is a spiritual sense, a spiritual <hi>Cabala,</hi> which as
it tends directly to holiness, so it is best and truest understood by the Sons
of the Spirit, who love God, and therefore know him. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, every thing is best known by its own similitudes and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies.</p>
                  <p>But I must take some other time to speak fully of these things. I have
but one thing more to say, and then I shall make my Applications of this
Doctrine, and so conclude.</p>
                  <p>5. Lastly, there is a sort of Gods dear Servants who walk in perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
who <hi>perfect holiness in the fear of God;</hi> and they have a degree of
Clarity and divine knowledge more than we can discourse of, and more
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56643:62"/>
certain than the Demonstrations of Geometry, brighter than the Sun,

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as a flame touches a flame, and combines into splendor and
to glory: so is the Spirit of a man united unto Christ by the Spirit of
God. These are the friends of God, and they best know Gods mind,
and they only that are so know how much such men do know. They
have a special <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from above:</hi> So that now you are come to the top
of all; this is the highest round of the Ladder, and the Angels stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it: they dwell in Love and Contemplation, they worship and obey, but
dispute not: and our quarrels and impertinent wranglings about Religion
are nothing else but the want of the measures of this State. Our light
is like a Candle, every wind of vain Doctrine blows it out, or spends
the wax, and makes the light tremulous; but the lights of Heaven are
fixed and bright, and shine for ever.</p>
                  <p>But that we may speak not only things mysterious, but things intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible;
how does it come to pass, by what means and what Oeconomy is
it effected, that a holy life is the best determination of all Questions, and
the surest way of knowledge? Is it to be supposed that a Godly man is
better enabled to determine the Questions of Purgatory of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation?
is the gift of Chastity the best way to reconcile <hi>Thomas</hi> and
<hi>Scotus?</hi> and is a temperate man alwaies a better Scholar than a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard?
To this I answer, that in all things in which true wisdom consists,
Holiness, which is the best wisdom, is the surest way of understanding
them. And this,</p>
                  <p>1. Is effected by Holiness as a proper and natural instrument: for
naturally every thing is best discerned by its proper light and congenial
instrument.

<hi>Idea,</hi> as a blind man does of Light and Colours which he never saw.</p>
                  <p>A good man, though unlearned in secular notices, is like the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of the Temple, narrow without and broad within: he sees not
so much of what profits not abroad, but whatsoever is within, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
Religion and the glorifications of God, that he sees with a broad
inspection: But all humane learning without God is but blindness and
ignorant folly.</p>
                  <p>But when it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, righteousness dipt
in the wells of Truth, it is like an eye of Gold in a rich Garment, or like
the light of Heaven, it shews it self by its own splendor. What Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is it to discourse of the Philosophy of the Sacrament, if you do not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56643:63"/>
feel the vertue of it? and the man that can with eloquence and subtlety
discourse of the instrumental efficacy of Baptismal waters, talks igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
in respect of him who hath <hi>the answer of a good Conscience</hi> within,
and is cleansed by the purifications of the Spirit. If the Question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
any thing that can perfect a man and make him happy, all that is
the proper knowledge and notice of the good man. How can a wicked
man understand the purities of the heart? and how can an evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Communicant tell what it is to have received Christ by Faith,
to dwell with him, to be united to him, to receive him in his heart? The
good man only understands that: the one sees the colour, and the other
feels the substance; the one discourses of the Sacrament, and the other
receives Christ; the one discourses for or against Transubstantiation,
but the good man feels himself to be changed and so joined to Christ,
that he only understands the true sense of Transubstantiation, while
he becomes to Christ bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, and of the same
Spirit with his Lord.</p>
                  <p>We talk much of Reformation, and (blessed be God) once we have
felt the good of it: But of late we have smarted under the name and
pretension: The Woman that lost her Groat, <hi>everrit domum,</hi> not <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit;</hi>
she swept the house, she did not turn the house out of doors. That
was but an ill Reformation that untiled the Roof and broke the Walls,
and was digging down the Foundation.</p>
                  <p>Now among all the pretensions of Reformation, who can tell better
what is, and what is not, true Reformation, than he that is truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
himself? He knows what pleases God, and can best tell by what
instruments he is reconciled. <hi>The mouth of the just bringeth forth wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and the lips of the righteous know what is acceptable,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 31, 32.</note> saith <hi>Solomon.</hi>
He cannot be cousened by names of things, and feels that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to be Imposture that is Sacrilegious: himself is humble and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
and therefore knows that is not Truth that perswades to Schism
and Disobedience: and most of the Questions of Christendom are such
which either are good for nothing, and therefore to be laid aside; or
if they be complicated with action, and are ministeries of practice, no
man can judge them so well as the spiritual man. <hi>That which best pleases
God, that which does good to our Neighbour, that which teaches sobriety,
that which combines with Government, that which speaks honour of God
and does him honour,</hi> that only is Truth. Holiness therefore is a proper
and natural instrument of Divine knowledge, and must needs be the
best way of instruction in the Questions of Christendom, because in the
most of them a Duty is complicated with the Proposition.</p>
                  <p>No man that intends to live holily can ever suffer any pretences of
Religion to be made to teach him to fight against his King. And when the
men of <hi>Geneva</hi> turned their Bishop out of doors, they might easily have
considered that the same person was their Prince too; and that must needs
be a strange Religion that rose up against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> at the same
time: but that hath been the method ever since. There was no Church
till then was ever governed without an Apostle or a Bishop: and since
then, they who go from their Bishop have said very often to their King
too, <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare:</hi> and when we see men pretending Religion,
and yet refuse to own the Kings Supremacy, they may upon the stock of
holiness easily reprove their own folly, by considering that such recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sancy
does introduce into our Churches the very worst, the most intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
parts of Popery: For <hi>perfect submission to</hi> Kings <hi>is the glory of
the</hi> Protestant <hi>Cause:</hi> and really the reproveable Doctrines of the Church
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56643:63"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> are by nothing so much confuted, as that they destroy good
life by consequent and evident deduction; as by an Induction of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
were easie to make apparent, if this were the proper season
for it.</p>
                  <p>2. Holiness is not only an advantage to the learning all wisdom and
holiness, but for the discerning that which is wise and holy from what
is trifling and useless and contentious; and to one of these heads all Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
will return: and therefore in all, from Holiness we have the best
Instructions. And this brings me to the next Particle of the general
Consideration. For that which we are taught by the holy Spirit of
God, this <hi>new nature,</hi> this <hi>vital principle</hi> within us, it is that which is
worth our learning; not vain and empty, idle and insignificant notions,
in which when you have laboured till your eyes are fixed in their Orbs,
and your flesh unfixed from its bones, you are no better and no wiser.
If the Spirit of God be your Teacher, he will teach you such truths as
will make you know and love God, and become like to him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
him for ever, by passing from similitude to union and eternal fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But what are you the better if any man should pretend to teach you
whether every Angel makes a <hi>species?</hi> and what is the individuation of
the Soul in the state of separation? what are you the wiser if you should
study and find out what place <hi>Adam</hi> should for ever have lived in if he
had not fallen? and what is any man the more learned if he hears the
disputes, whether <hi>Adam</hi> should have multiplyed Children in the state
of Innocence, and what would have been the event of things if one
Child had been born before his Fathers sin?</p>
                  <p>Too many Scholars have lived upon Air and empty notions for many
ages past, and troubled themselves with tying &amp; untying knots, like <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondriacks</hi>
in a fit of Melancholy, thinking of <hi>nothing,</hi> &amp; troubling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with <hi>nothing,</hi> and falling out about <hi>nothings,</hi> and being very wise &amp;
very learned in things that are not and work not, and were never planted
in <hi>Paradise</hi> by the finger of God. Mens notions are too often like the Mules,
begotten by aequivocal and unnatural Generations; but they make no <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:</hi>
they are begotten, but they can beget nothing; they are the effects of
long study, but they can do no good when they are produced: they are
not that which <hi>Solomon</hi> calls <hi>viam intelligentiae, the way of understanding.</hi>
If the Spirit of God be our Teacher, we shall learn to avoid evil, and
to do good, to be wise and to be holy, to be profitable and careful:
and they that walk in this way shall find more peace in their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
more skill in the Scriptures, more satisfaction in their doubts, than
can be obtained by all the polemical and impertinent disputations of the
world. And if the holy Spirit can teach us how vain a thing it is to do
foolish things, he also will teach us how vain a thing it is to trouble the
world with foolish Questions, to disturb the Church for interest or pride,
to resist Government in things indifferent, to spend the peoples zeal in
things unprofitable, to make Religion to consist in outsides, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to circumstances and trifling regards. No, no, the Man that is wise,
he that is conducted by the Spirit of God, knows better in what Christs
Kingdom does consist, than to throw away his time and interest, and
peace and safety; for what? for Religion? no: for the Body of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
not so much: for the Garment of the Body of Religion? no, not
for so much; but for the <hi>Fringes</hi> of the <hi>Garment</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
for such and no better are the disputes that trouble our discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
Brethren; they are <hi>things,</hi> or rather <hi>Circumstances</hi> and <hi>manners</hi>
of <hi>things,</hi> in which the Soul and Spirit is not at all concerned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:56643:64"/>
3. Holiness of life is the best way of finding out truth and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
not only as a <hi>Natural medium,</hi> nor only as a <hi>prudent medium,</hi> but
as a <hi>means by way of Divine blessing. He that hath my Commandments and
keepeth them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John. 14. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved
of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest my self to him.</hi> Here
we have a promise for it; and upon that we may relye.</p>
                  <p>The old man that confuted the <hi>Arian</hi> Priest by a plain recital of his
<hi>Creed,</hi> found a mighty power of God effecting his own Work by a strange
manner, and by a very plain instrument: it wrought a divine blessing
just as Sacraments use to do: and this Lightning sometimes comes in a
strange manner as a peculiar blessing to good men. For God kept the
secrets of his Kingdom from the wise Heathens and the learned <hi>Jews,</hi>
revealing them to Babes, not because they had less learning, but because
they had more love; they were children and Babes in <hi>Malice,</hi> they loved
Christ, and so he became to them a light and a glory. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had more
Learning then they all; and <hi>Moses</hi> was instructed in all the Learning of
the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> yet because he was the meekest man upon Earth, he was
also the wisest, and to his humane Learning in which he was excellent,
he had a divine light and excellent wisdom superadded to him by way
of spiritual blessings. And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> though he went very far to the
Knowledge of many great and excellent truths by the force of humane
learning, yet he was far short of perfective truth and true wisdom till
he learned a new Lesson in a new School, at the feet of one greater then
his <hi>Gamaliel:</hi> his learning grew much greater, his notions brighter,
his skill deeper, by the love of Christ, and his desires, his passionate
desires after <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The force and use of humane learning, and of this <hi>Divine learning</hi> I am
now speaking of, are both well expressed by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, 29. 11, 12.
And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a Book that is sealed,
which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee:
and he saith, I cannot, for it is seal'd. And the Book is delivered to him
that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not
learned.</hi> He that is no learned man, who is not bred up in the Schools
of the Prophets, cannot read Gods Book for want of learning. For
humane Learning is the gate and first entrance of Divine vision; not the
only one indeed, but the common gate. But beyond this, there must be
another learning; for he that is learned, bring the Book to him, and you
are not much the better as to the secret part of it, if the Book be sealed,
if his eyes be closed, if his heart be not opened, if God does not speak
to him in the secret way of discipline. Humane learning is an excellent
Foundation; but the top-stone is laid by Love and Conformity to the
will of God. For we may further observe, that blindnesse, errour and
Ignorance are the punishments which God sends upon wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men. <hi>Etiamsi propter nostrae intelligentiae tarditatem &amp; vitae demeritum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas
nondum se apertissime ostenderit,</hi> was St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s expression, The truth
hath not yet been manifested fully to us, <hi>by reason of our demerits:</hi> our sins
have hindred the brightness of the truth from shining upon us. And St.
<hi>Paul</hi> observes, that when the Heathens gave themselves <hi>over to lusts, God
gave them over to strong delusions,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 25, 26. Eccl. 2. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; to believe a Lie.</hi> But <hi>God giveth to a man
that is good in his sight, wisdom and knowledge and joy,</hi> said the wise <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</hi>
But this is most expresly promised in the New Testament, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in that admirable <hi>Sermon</hi> which our blessed Saviour preach'd a little
before his death. <hi>The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father,
will send in my name,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 14. 26</note> 
                     <hi>he shall teach you all things.</hi> Well: there's our Teacher
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56643:64"/>
told of plainly: But how shall we obtain this teacher, and how shall we
be taught? <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17. Christ will pray for us that we may have this
Spirit. That's well: but shall all Christians have the Spirit? Yes, all
that will live like Christians: for so said Christ, <hi>If ye love me, keep my
Commandments; and I will pray the Father, and he will give you another
Comforter, that may abide with you for ever; even the spirit of truth, whom
the World cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him.</hi>
Mark these things. The Spirit of God is our teacher: he will abide with
us for ever to be our teacher: he will teach us all things; but how?
<hi>if ye love Christ,</hi> if ye keep his Commandments, but not else: if ye be
of the World, that is of worldly affections, ye cannot see him, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know him. And this is the particular I am now to speak to, The way
by which the Spirit of God teaches us in all the ways and secrets of God,
is Love and Holinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secreta Dei Deo nostro &amp; filiis domus ejus,</hi> Gods secrets are to himself
and the sons of his House, saith the <hi>Jewish</hi> Proverb. Love is the great
instrument of Divine knowledge, that is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the height
of all that is to be taught or learned. Love is Obedience,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Ethic. c. 1.</note> and we learn
his words best when we practise them: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
said <hi>Aristotle;</hi> those things which they that learn ought to
practise,<note place="margin">Nullum bonum perfectè nosci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quod non perfectè amatur. <hi>Aug. lib 83. qu.</hi> de gratia Christi.</note> even while they practise will best learn. <hi>Quisquis non
venit, profectò nec didicit: Ita enim Dominus docet per Spiritus gratiam,
ut quod quisque didicerit, non tantum cognoscendo videat, sed etiam
volendo appetat &amp; agendo perficiat.</hi> St. <hi>Austin De gratia Christi lib. 1. c.</hi> 14.
Unlesse we come to Christ, we shall never learn: for so our Blessed Lord
teaches us by the grace of his Spirit, that what any one learns, he not
only sees it by knowledge, but desires it by choice, and perfects it by
practice.</p>
                  <p>4. When this is reduced to practice and experience, we find not only
in things of practice, but even in deepest mysteries, not only the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
and most eminent Saints, but even every good man can best tell what
is true, and best reprove an error.</p>
                  <p>He that goes about to speak of and to understand the <hi>mysterious Trinity,</hi>
and does it by words and names of mans invention, or by such which
signifie contingently, if he reckons this mystery by the Mythology of
Numbers, by the <hi>Cabala</hi> of Letters, by the distinctions of the School, and
by the weak inventions of disputing people; if he only talks of Essences
and existencies, Hypostases and personalities, distinctions without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and priority in Coequalities, and unity in Pluralities, and of superior
Praedicates of no larger extent then the inferior Subjects, he may amuse
himself, and find his understanding will be like St. <hi>Peters</hi> upon the Mount
of <hi>Tabor</hi> at the Transfiguration: he may build three Tabernacles in
his head, and talk something, but he knows not what. But the good
man that feels the <hi>power of the Father,</hi> and he to whom the Son is become
<hi>Wisdom, Righteousnesse, Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Redemption;</hi> he in <hi>whose heart
the love of the Spirit of God is spred,</hi> to whom God hath communicated
the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the <hi>Comforter;</hi> this man, though he understands nothing
of that which is unintelligible, yet <hi>he only</hi> understands the mysterious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Holy Trinity. No man can be convinced well and wisely of
the Article of the <hi>Holy, Blessed,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndivided Trinity,</hi> but he that feels
the mightiness of the Father begetting him to <hi>a new life,</hi> the wisdom of
the Son <hi>building him up in a most holy Faith,</hi> and the <hi>love of the Spirit of God</hi>
making him to become like unto God.</p>
                  <p>He that hath passed from his Childhood in Grace under the spiritual
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56643:65"/>
generation of the <hi>Father,</hi> and is gone forward to be a <hi>young man</hi> in Christ,
strong and vigorous in holy actions and holy undertakings, and from
thence is become an old Disciple, and strong and grown old in Religion,
and the conversation of the Spirit; this man best understands the secret
and undiscernable oeconomy, he feels this unintelligible Mystery, and sees
with his heart what his tongue can never express, and his Metaphysicks
can never prove. In these cases Faith and Love are the best Knowledg,
and <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is best known by <hi>the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> and
if the Kingdom of God be <hi>in us,</hi> then we know God, and are known of
him; and when we communicate of the Spirit of God, when we pray for
him, and have received him, and entertained him, and dwelt with him,
and warmed our selves by his holy fires, then we know him too: But
there is no other satisfactory knowledge of the Blessed <hi>Trinity</hi> but this:
And therefore whatever thing is spoken of God <hi>Metaphysically,</hi> there is
no knowing of God <hi>Theologically,</hi> and as he ought to be known, but by
the measures of Holiness, and the proper light of the Spirit of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in this case Experience is the best Learning, and Christianity is
the best Institution, and the Spirit of God is the best Teacher, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
is the greatest Wisdom; and he that sins most is the most Ignorant,
and the humble and obedient man is the best Scholar: <hi>For the Spirit of
God is a loving Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ecclus. 21. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>and will not enter into a polluted Soul: But he that
keepeth the Law getteth the understanding thereof, and the perfection of the
fear of the Lord is Wisdom,</hi> said the wise <hi>Ben-Sirach.</hi> And now give me
leave to apply the Doctrine to you, and so I shall dismiss you from this
attention.</p>
                  <p>Many ways have been attempted to reconcile the differences of the
Church in matters of Religion, and all the Counsels of man have yet
prov'd ineffective: Let us now try Gods method, let us betake our selves
to live holily, and then the Spirit of God will lead us into all Truth. And
indeed <hi>it matters not what Religion any man is of, if he be a Villain;</hi> the
Opinion of his Sect, as it will not save his Soul, so neither will it do
good to the Publick: But this is a sure Rule, If the holy man best un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
Wisdom and Religion, then by the proportions of holiness
we shall best measure the Doctrines that are obtruded to the disturbance
of our Peace, and the dishonour of the Gospel. And therefore,</p>
                  <p>1. That is no good Religion whose Principles destroy any duty of
Religion. He that shall maintain it to be lawful to make a <hi>War</hi> for the
defence of his <hi>Opinion,</hi> be it what it will, his Doctrine is against God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.
Any thing that is proud, any thing that is peevish and scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
any thing that is uncharitable, is against the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that
<hi>form of sound Doctrine</hi> which the Apostle speaks of: And I remember
that <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> telling of <hi>George</hi> a proud and factious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
that he was an Informer against his Brethren, he says, he did it
<hi>oblitus professionis suae, quae nil nisi justum suadet &amp; lene;</hi> he forgot his
Profession, which teaches nothing but justice and meekness, kindnesses
and charity. And however <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others are pleased to take
but indirect and imperfect notice of it, yet <hi>Goodness</hi> is the best note of
the true Church.</p>
                  <p>2. It is but an ill sign of Holiness when a man is busie in troubling
himself and his Superiour in little Scruples and phantastick Opinions,
about things not concerning the life of Religion, or the pleasure of God,
or the excellencies of the Spirit. A good man knows how to please
God, how to converse with him, how to advance the Kingdom of the
Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> to set forward Holiness, and the Love of God and of his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56643:65"/>
Brother; and he knows also that there is no Godliness in spending our
time and our talk, our heart and our spirits, about the Garments and
Outsides of Religion: And they can ill teach others, that do not know
that Religion does not consist in these things; but Obedience may, and
<hi>reductively</hi> that is Religion: and he that for that which is no part of
Religion destroys Religion directly, by neglecting that Duty that is
adopted into Religion, is a man of Phancy and of the World; but he
gives but an ill account that he is a man of God, and a Son of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Spend not your time in that which profits not; for your labour and
your health, your time and your Studies are very valuable; and it is a
thousand pities to see a diligent and a hopeful person spend himself in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
Cockle-shells and little Pebbles, in telling Sands upon the shores,
and making Garlands of useless Daisies. Study that which is profitable,
that which will make you useful to Churches and Commonwealths, that
which will make you desirable and wise. Only I shall add this to you,
That in <hi>Learning</hi> there are variety of things as well as in <hi>Religion:</hi> there
is Mint and Cummin, and there are the weighty things of the Law; so
there are Studies more and less useful, and every thing that is useful will
be required in its time: and I may in this also use the words of our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour, <hi>These things ought you to</hi> look after, and <hi>not to leave the other</hi>
unregarded. But your great care is to be in the things of God and of
Religion, in Holiness and true Wisdom, remembring the saying of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
That the Knowledge that arises from Goodness is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
something that is more certain and more divine than all demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
than all other Learnings of the World.</p>
                  <p>3. That's no good Religion that disturbs Governments, or shakes a
foundation of publick Peace. <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> are the Foundations
and the great Principles of Unity, of Peace, and Government; like <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi>
and <hi>Leah</hi> they build up the house of <hi>Israel:</hi> and those blind <hi>Sampsons</hi>
that shake these Pillars, intend to pull the house down. <hi>My Son, fear God
and the King,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, and meddle not with them that are given to
change.</hi> That is not Truth that loves Changes; and the new-nothings
of Heretical and Schismatical Preachers are infinitely far from the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of Truth.</p>

Hebrew Letters; implying to us, that <hi>Truth</hi> is first, and will be last, and it
is the same all the way, and combines and unites all extreams; it ties all
ends together. <hi>Truth is lasting, and ever full of blessing:</hi> For the <hi>Jews</hi>
observe that those Letters which signifie <hi>Truth,</hi> are both in the figure
and the number Quadrate, firm and cubical; these signifie a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

in Hebrew signifies <hi>a lye,</hi>

the Principles of Christianity, hath been blessed by the issues of that
stabiliment; it hath for sixteen hundred years combined with <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>

intend to be of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> you see here the best <hi>Compendium</hi> of your
Studies, the best abbreviature of your Labours, the truest Method of
Wisdom, and the infallible, the only way of judging concerning the
Disputes and Questions in <hi>Christendom.</hi> It is not by reading multitudes
of Books, but by studying the Truth of God: It is not by laborious
Commentaries of the Doctors that you can finish your work, but by the
Expositions of the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> It is not by the Rules of <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi>
but by the proportions of <hi>Holiness:</hi> And when all Books are read, and
all Arguments examined, and all Authorities alledged, nothing can be
found to be true that is unholy. <hi>Give your selves to reading, to exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and to Doctrine,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul. Read</hi> all good Books you can;
but <hi>exhortation</hi> unto good life is the best Instrument, and the best Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of true <hi>Doctrine,</hi> of that which is <hi>according to Godliness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And let me tell you this, The great Learning of the Fathers was more
owing to their Piety than to their Skill; more to God than to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
and to this purpose is that excellent Ejaculation of St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
with which I will conclude. <hi>O blessed and happy men,</hi>

the Looking-glass of the Religious, the Captain of the Penitents, the
destruction of Heresies, the receptacle of Graces, the habitation of the Holy
Ghost?</hi> These were the men that prevailed against Errour, because they
lived according to Truth: and whoever shall oppose you and the Truth
you walk by, may better be confuted by your Lives than by your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputations.
Let <hi>your adversaries have no evil thing to say of you,</hi> and
then you will best silence them: For all Heresies and false Doctrines are
but like <hi>Myron</hi>'s counterfeit Cow, it deceived none but Beasts; and
these can cozen none but the wicked and the negligent, them that love

Truth will prevail.] But if ye live wickedly and scandalously, every

                     <q> But every Man in his own Order: Christ the first fruits; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
they that are Christ's at his coming.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE Condition of Man in this world is so limited and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
so relative and imperfect, that the best things he
does he does weakly, and the best things he hath are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
in their very constitution. I need not tell how
little it is that we know; the greatest indication of this is,
That we can never tell how many things we know not: and we may soon
span our own Knowledge, but our Ignorance we can never fathom. Our
very Will, in which Mankind pretends to be most noble and imperial,
is a direct state of imperfection; and our very liberty of Chusing good
and evil is permitted to us, not to make us proud, but to make us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for it supposes weakness of Reason and weakness of Love. For
if we understood all the degrees of Amability in the Service of God, or
if we had such love to God as he deserves, and so perfect a conviction
as were fit for his Services, we could no more Deliberate: For Liberty
of Will is like the motion of a Magnetick Needle toward the North,
full of trembling and uncertainty till it were fixed in the beloved Point;
it wavers as long as it is free, and is at rest when it can chuse no more.
And truly what is the hope of man? It is indeed the Resurrection of
of the Soul in this world from sorrow and her saddest pressures, and
like the Twilight to the Day, and the Harbinger of joy; but still it is
but a conjugation of Infirmities, and proclaims our present calamity,
only because it is uneasie here, it thrusts us forwards toward the light
and glories of the Resurrection.</p>
                  <p>For as a Worm creeping with her belly on the ground, with her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and share of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Curse, lifts up its head to partake a little of
the blessings of the air, and opens the junctures of her imperfect body,
and curles her little rings into knots and combinations, drawing up her
tail to a neighbourhood of the heads pleasure and motion; but still it
must return to abide the fate of its own nature, and dwell and sleep
upon the dust: So are the hopes of a mortal man; he opens his eyes
and looks upon fine things at distance, and shuts them again with weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
because they are too glorious to behold; and the Man rejoices
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56643:69"/>
because he hopes fine things are staying for him; but his heart akes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knows there are a thousand ways to fail and miss of those glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and though he hopes, yet he enjoys not; he longs, but he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses
not, and must be content with his portion of dust; and being <hi>a
worm and no man</hi> must lie down in this portion, before he can receive
the end of his hopes, the salvation of his Soul in the Resurrection of
the dead. For as Death is the end of our lives, so is the Resurrection
the end of our hopes; and as we dye daily, so we daily hope: but Death
which is the end of our life, is the enlargement of our Spirits from hope
to certainty, from uncertain fears to certain expectations, from the
death of the Body to the life of the Soul; that is, to partake of the
light and life of Christ, to rise to life as he did; for his Resurrection is
the beginning of ours: He dyed for us alone, not for himself; but he
rose again for himself and us too. So that if he did rise, so shall we;
the Resurrection shall be universal; good and bad, all shall rise, but not
altogether: First Christ, then we that are Christs; and yet there is a
third Resurrection, though not spoken of here; but thus it shall be. <hi>The
dead of Christ shall rise first;</hi> that is, next to Christ; and after them the
wicked shall rise to condemnation.</p>
                  <p>So that you see here is the sum of affairs treated of in my Text:
Not whether it be lawful to eat a Tortoise or a Mushroom, or to tread
with the foot bare upon the ground within the Octaves of <hi>Easter. It is
not here inquired</hi> whether Angels be material or immaterial; or whether
the dwellings of dead Infants be within the Air or in the Regions of
the Earth; the inquiry here is, whether we <hi>are to be Christians or no?
whether we are to live good lives or no?</hi> or whether it be permitted to us
to live with Lust or Covetousness acted with all the Daughters of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
and Ambition? whether there be any such thing as sin, any judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
for Consciences, any rewards of Piety, any difference of Good and
Bad, any rewards after this life? This is the design of these words by
proper interpretation: for if men shall dye like Dogs and Sheep, they
will certainly live like Wolves and Foxes: but he that believes the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Resurrection, hath entertained the greatest Demonstration
in the world, That nothing can make us happy but the Knowledge of
God, and Conformity to the life and death of the Holy Jesus. Here
therefore are the great Hinges of all Religion: 1. Christ is already ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
from the dead. 2. We also shall rise in Gods time and our order.
Christ is the first fruits. But there shall be a full Harvest of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and all shall rise. My Text speaks only of the Resurrection of the
just, of them that belong to Christ; explicitely I say of these, and therefore
directly of Resurrection to life Eternal. But because he also says there
shall be an order for every man; and yet every man does not belong to
Christ; therefore indirectly also he implies the more universal Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
unto Judgment: But this shall be the last thing that shall be done;
for, according to the Proverb of the Jews, <hi>Michael</hi> flies but with one
wing, and <hi>Gabriel</hi> with two; God is quick in sending Angels of peace,
and they flie apace; but the messengers of wrath come slowly: God is
more hasty to glorifie his Servants than to condemn the wicked. And
therefore in the story of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> we find that the beggar dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
first; the good man <hi>Lazarus</hi> was first taken away from his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
to his comfort, and afterwards the rich man dyed: and as the good
many times die first, so all of them rise first, as if it were a matter of
haste: And as the mothers breasts swell and shoot and long to give food
to her babe; so Gods bowels did yearn over his banished Children, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56643:69"/>
he longs to cause them to eat and drink in his Kingdom. And at last
the wicked shall rise unto condemnation, for that must be done too;
every man in his own order: First Christ, then Christs Servants, and at
last Christs Enemies. The first of these is the great ground of our Faith,
the second is the consummation of all our hopes: the first is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God that stands sure, the second is that superstructure that shall
never perish: by the first we believe in God unto righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by the second we live in God unto salvation: But the third, for
that also is true and must be considered, is the great affrightment of all
them that live ungodly. But in the whole, Christs Resurrection and ours
is the <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> of a Christian;</hi> that as <hi>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
and to day, and the same for ever,</hi> so may we in Christ become the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of the Resurrection, the same or better than yesterday in our natural
life; the same body and the same soul tyed together in the same essential
union, with this only difference, that not Nature but Grace and Glory
with an Hermetick seal give us a new signature, whereby we shall no
more be changed, but like unto Christ our head we shall become the
same for ever. Of these I shall discourse in order. 1. That Christ who
is the first fruits, is the first in this order: he is already risen from the
dead. 2. We shall all take our turns, we shall die, and as sure as death
we shall all rise again. And 3. This very order is effective of the thing
it self. That Christ is first risen, is the demonstration and certainty of
ours, for because there is an order in this oeconomy, the first in the kind
is the measure of the rest. If Christ be the first fruits, we are the whole
vintage, and we shall all die in the order of Nature, and shall rise again
in the order of Christ: They that are Christ's, and are found so at his
coming, shall partake of his Resurrection. But Christ first, then they
that are Christ's: that's the order.</p>
                  <p>1. Christ is the first fruits; he is already risen from the dead: For he
alone could not be held by death. <hi>Free among the dead.</hi>

                  <p>Death was Sins eldest Daughter, and the Grave-cloaths were her first
mantle; but Christ was Conqueror over both, and came to take that
away, and to disarm this. This was a glory fit for the head of mankind,
but it was too great and too good to be easily believed by incredulous
and weak-hearted Man. It was at first doubted of by all that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
but they that saw it had no reason to doubt any longer. But
what's that to us who saw it not? Yes, very much, <hi>Valde dubitatum est
ab illis, ne dubitaretur à nobis,</hi> saith S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> They doubted very
much, that by their confirmation we might be established and doubt no
more. <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> saw him first, and she ran with joy and said
<hi>she had seen the Lord, and that he was risen from the dead; but they believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her not: After that divers women together saw him,</hi> and they told it,
but had no thanks for their pains, and obtained no credit among the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
The two Disciples that went to <hi>Emaus</hi> saw him, talked with
him, eat with him, and they ran and told it: they told true, but no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
believed them: Then S. <hi>Peter</hi> saw him, but he was not yet got into
the Chair of the Catholick Church, they did not think him infallible,
and so they believed him not at all. Five times in one day he appeared;
for after all this he appeared to the Eleven; they were indeed tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
with joy and wonder, but they would scarce believe their own
eyes, and though they saw him they doubted. Well, all this was not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56643:70"/>
enough; he was seen also of <hi>James,</hi> and suffered <hi>Thomas</hi> to thrust his
hand into his side, and appeared to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and was seen by <hi>five hundred
brethren at once.</hi> So that there is no capacity of mankind, no time, no
place, but had an ocular demonstration of his Resurrection. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to Men and Women, to the Clergy and the Laity, to sinners of
both sexes; to weak men and to criminals, to doubters and denyers, at
home and abroad, in publick and in private, in their houses and their
journeys, unexpected and by appointment, betimes in the morning and
late at night, to them in conjunction and to them in dispersion, when
they did look for him and when they did not; he <hi>appeared upon earth to
many, and to S.</hi> Paul <hi>and S.</hi> Stephen <hi>from Heaven:</hi> So that we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
no greater testimony than all these are able to give us; and they
saw for themselves and for us too, that the Faith and certainty of the
Resurrection of <hi>Jesus</hi> might be conveyed to all that shall die and follow
Christ in their own order.</p>
                  <p>Now this being matter of fact, cannot be supposed infinite, but limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to time and place, and therefore to be proved by them who at that
time were upon the place; good men and true, simple and yet losers
by the bargain, many and united, confident and constant, preaching it
all their life, and stoutly maintaining it at their death: Men that would
not deceive others, and Men that could not be deceived themselves in a
matter so notorious and so proved, and so seen: and if this be not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
credibility in a matter of fact as this was, then we can have no sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
credibly transmitted to us, no Records kept, no Acts of Courts, no
Narratives of the dayes of old, no Traditions of our Fathers, no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials
of them in the third Generation. Nay, if from these we have
not sufficient causes, and arguments of Faith, how shall we be able to
know the will of Heaven upon Earth? unless God do not only tell it
once, but always, and not only always to some men, but always to all
men: for if some men must believe others, they can never do it in any
thing more reasonably than in this; and if we may not trust them in
this, then without a perpetual miracle no man could have Faith: for
Faith could never come by hearing, by nothing but by seeing. But if
there be any use of History, any Faith in men, any honesty in manners,
any truth in humane entercourse; if there be any use of Apostles or
Teachers, of Ambassadors or Letters, of ears or hearing; if there be
any such thing as the Grace of Faith, that is less than demonstration or
intuition, then we may be as sure that Christ the first Fruits is already ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
as all these credibilities can make us. But let us take heed; as God
hates a a lie, so he hates incredulity; an obstinate, a foolish and pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
understanding. What we do every minute of our lives in matters
of title and great concernment, if we refuse to do it in Religion, which
yet is to be conducted as all humane affairs are, by humane instruments
and arguments of perswasion proper to the nature of the thing, it is an
obstinacy as cross to humane reason, as it is to Divine Faith.</p>
                  <p>But this Article was so clearly proved, that presently it came to pass
that men were no longer ashamed of the Cross, but it was worn upon
breasts, printed in the air, drawn upon foreheads, carried upon Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
put upon Crowns Imperial, presently it came to pass that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of the despised Jesus did infinitely prevail: a Religion that taught
men to be meek and humble, apt to receive injuries, but unapt to do
any; a Religion that gave countenance to the poor and pitiful, in a time
when riches were adored, and ambition and pleasure had possessed the
heart of all mankind; a Religion that would change the face of things,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56643:70"/>
and the hearts of men, and break vile habits into gentleness and counsel;
that such a Religion, in such a time, by the Sermons and conduct of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shermen,
men of mean breeding and illiberal Arts, should so speedily
triumph over the Philosophy of the world, and the arguments of the
subtle, and the Sermons of the Eloquent; the Power of Princes and the
Interests of States, the inclinations of nature and the blindness of zeal,
the force of custom and the sollicitation of passions, the pleasures of
sin and the busie Arts of the Devil; that is, against Wit, and Power, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
and Wilfulness, Fame and Money, Nature and Empire, which
are all the causes in this World that can make a thing impossible; this,
this is to be ascribed to the power of God, and is the great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Resurrection of Jesus. Every thing was an Argument
for it, and improved it; no Objection could hinder it, no Enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
it; whatsoever was for them, it made the Religion to encrease;
whatsoever was against them, made it to encrease; Sun-shine and
Storms, fair Weather or foul, it was all one as to the event of things:
for they were instruments in the hands of God, who could make what
himself should chuse to be the product of any cause; so that if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
had peace, they went abroad and brought in Converts; if they
had no peace but persecution, the Converts came in to them. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
they allured and enticed the World by the beauty of holiness;
in affliction and trouble they amazed all men with the splendour of their
Innocence, and the glories of their patience; and quickly it was that the
World became Disciple to the glorious <hi>Nazarene,</hi> and men could no
longer doubt of the Resurrection of Jesus, when it became so demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by the certainty of them that saw it, and the courage of them
that dyed for it, and the multitude of them that believed it; who by
their Sermons and their Actions, by their publick Offices and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
by Festivals and Eucharists, by Arguments of Experience and
Sense, by Reason and Religion, by perswading rational Men, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
believing Christians, by their living in the obedience of Jesus,
and dying for the testimony of Jesus, have greatly advanced his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and his Power, and his Glory, into which he entred after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
from the dead. For he is the first Fruits; and if we hope to
rise through him, we must confess that himself is first risen from the
dead. That's the first particular.</p>
                  <p>2. There is an order for us also: We also shall rise again:
<q>
                        <l>Combustúsque senex tumulo procedit adultus,</l>
                        <l>Consumens dat membra rogus;—</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ashes of old <hi>Camillus</hi> shall stand up spritely from his Urn; and the
Funeral fires shall produce a new warmth to the dead bones of all those
who dyed under the arms of all the Enemies of the Roman greatness.
This is a less wonder than the former: for <hi>admonetur omnis aetas jam
fieri posse quod aliquando factum est.</hi> If it was done once, it may be done
again; for since it could never have been done but by a power that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
that infinite must also be eternal and indeficient. By the same Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
power which restored life to the dead body of our living Lord,
we may all be restored to a new life in the Resurrection of the dead.</p>
                  <p>When Man was not, what power, what causes made him to be? what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it was, it did then as great a work as to raise his body to the same
being again; and because we know not the method of Natures secret
changes, and how we can be fashioned beneath <hi>in secreto terrae,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
handle and discern the possibilities and seminal powers in the ashes
of dissolved bones, must our ignorance in Philosophy be put in balance
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56643:71"/>
against the Articles of Religion, the hopes of Mankind, the Faith of
Nations and the truth of God? and are our opinions of the power of
God so low, that our understanding must be his measure; and he shall
be confessed to do nothing unless it be made plain in our Philosophy?
Certainly we have a low opinion of God unless we believe he can do
more things than we can understand: But let us hear S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration;
If the Corn dies and lives again; if it lays its body down, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
alteration, dissolution and death, but at the Spring rises again in
the verdure of a leaf, in the fulness of the ear, in the kidneys of Wheat;
if it proceeds from little to great, from nakedness to ornament, from
emptiness to plenty, from unity to multitude, from death to life: be a
Sadducee no more, shame not thy understanding, and reproach not
the weakness of thy Faith, by thinking that Corn can be restored to
life, and Man cannot; especially since in every Creature the obediential
capacity is infinite, and cannot admit degrees; for every Creature can
be any thing under the power of God, which cannot be less than infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</p>
                  <p>But we find no obscure foot-steps of this mystery even amongst the
Heathens: <hi>Pliny</hi> reports that <hi>Appion</hi> the Grammarian by the use of the
Plant <hi>Osiris</hi> called <hi>Homer</hi> from his Grave; and in <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> we
find that <hi>Aelius Tubero</hi> returned to life when he was seated in his Funeral
pile; and in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that <hi>Soleus</hi> after three days burial did live;
and in <hi>Valerius</hi> that <hi>Aeris Pamphilius</hi> did so after ten days. And it was so
commonly believed, that <hi>Glaucus</hi> who was choked in a Vessel of honey
did rise again, that it grew to a Proverb; <hi>Glaucus poto melle surrexit;
Glaucus</hi> having tasted honey, dyed and lived again. I pretend not to
believe these stories to be true; <hi>but from these instances it may be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that</hi> they believed it possible that there should be a Resurrection
from the dead; and natural reason, and their Philosophy did not wholly
destroy their hopes and expectation to have a portion in this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
                  <p>For God knowing that the great hopes of Man, that the biggest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment
of Religion, the sanction of private Justice, the band of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and holy Courage, <hi>does wholly derive from the Article of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
was pleased not only to make it credible, but easie and familiar
to us; and we so converse every night with the Image of death, that
every morning we find an argument of the Resurrection. <hi>Sleep and
Death have but one mother, and they have one name in common.</hi>

they that die are fallen asleep, and the Resurrection is but an awakening
and standing up from sleep: but in sleep our senses are as fast bound by
Nature, as our Joints are by the Grave-cloaths; and unless an <hi>Angel of
God waken us every morning,</hi> we must confess our selves as unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with men, as we now are afraid to die &amp; to converse with Spirits.
But however Death it self is no more; it is but darkness and a shadow, a
rest and a forgetfulness. <hi>What is there more in death? what is there less in
sleep?</hi> For do we not see by experience that nothing of equal loudness
does awaken us sooner than a mans voice, especially if he be called by
name? and thus also it shall be in the Resurrection: We shall be awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the voice of a man, and he that called <hi>Lazarus</hi> by name from
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56643:71"/>
his Grave, shall also call us: for although S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, <hi>that the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
shall sound, and there shall be the voice of an Arch-Angel;</hi> yet this is
not a word of Nature, but of Office and Ministry: Christ himself is
that <hi>Arch-Angel,</hi> and he shall <hi>descend with a mighty shout,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Thes. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.</note> (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)

                     <note place="margin">John 5. 28.</note> So that
we shall be awakened by the voice of a Man, because we are only fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
asleep by the decree of God; and when the Cock and the Lark call
us up to prayer and labour, the first thing we see is an argument of our
Resurrection from the dead. And when we consider what the Greek
Church reports, That amongst them the bodies of those that die Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
will not return to dust till the Censure be taken off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we
may with a little faith and reason believe, that the same power that
keeps them from their natural Dissolution, can recall then to life and
union. I will not now insist upon the story of the Rising Bones seen eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
year in <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor the pretences of the Chymists, that they from the
ashes of Flowers can re-produce from the same materials the same beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in colour and figure; for he that proves a certain Truth from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Argument, is like him that wears a wooden leg when he hath
two sound legs already; it hinders his going, but helps him not: the
Truth of God stands not in need of such supporters, Nature alone is
a sufficient Preacher:

these heaps it is not of the least consideration, that there was never any
good man, who having been taught this Article, but if he served God,
he also relied upon this. If he believed God, he believed this; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
S. <hi>Paul</hi> says that they who were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
they who had no hope (meaning of the Resurrection) were also Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists,
and without God in the world. And it is remarkable what S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
observes, That when the World saw the righteous <hi>Abel</hi> destroyed,
and that the murderer out-lived his crime, and built up a numerous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and grew mighty upon Earth, they neglected the service of God
upon that account, till God in pity of their prejudice and foolish argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
took <hi>Enoch</hi> up to Heaven to recover them from their impieties, by
shewing them that their bodies and souls should be rewarded for ever in
an Eternal union. But Christ the first fruits is gone before, and himself
did promise, that when himself was lifted up he would draw all men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him: <hi>Every man in his own order;</hi> first Christ, then <hi>they that are
Christ's at his coming.</hi> And so I have done with the second Particular,
not Christ only, but we also shall rise in Gods time and our order.</p>
                  <p>But concerning this order I must speak a word or two, not only for
the fuller handling the Text, but because it will be matter of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56643:72"/>
of what hath been already spoken of the Article of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>3. First Christ and then we: And we therefore because Christ is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
risen: But you must remember, that the Resurrection and Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Christ was the reward of his perfect obedience and purest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and he calling us to an imitation of the same obedience, and the
same perfect holiness, prepares a way for us to the same Resurrection. If
we by holiness become the Sons of God as Christ was, we shall also, as he
was, become the Sons of God in the Resurrection: But upon no other
terms. So said our blessed Lord himself: <hi>Ye which have followed me in
the Regeneration,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 14. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye
also shall sit upon Thrones judging the Tribes of Israel.</hi> For as it was with
Christ the first Fruits, so it shall be with all Christians in their own order:
as with the Head, so it shall be with the Members. He was the Son of
God by love and obedience, and then became the Son of God by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
from the dead to life Eternal, and so shall we; but we cannot
be so in any other way. To them that are Christ's, and to none else shall
this be given: For we must know that God hath sent Christ into the
World to be a great example and demonstration of the Oeconomy and
Dispensation of Eternal life. As God brought Christ to glory, so he
will bring us, but by no other method. He first obeyed the will of God,
and patiently suffered the will of God; he dyed and rose again, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into glory; and so must we. Thus Christ is made <hi>Via, Veritas,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Vita,</hi> the Way, the Truth, and the Life; that is, the true way to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life: He first trode this Wine-press, and we must insist in the same
steps, or we shall never partake of this blessed Resurrection. He was
made the Son of God in a most glorious manner, and we by him, by his
merit, and by his grace, and by his example: but other than this there
is no way of Salvation for us: That's the first and great effect of this
glorious order.</p>
                  <p>4. But there is one thing more in it yet: <hi>Every man in his own order.
First Christ,</hi> and then <hi>they that are Christ's:</hi> But what shall become of
them that are not Christs? why there is an order for them too: First,
<hi>they that are Christs;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 20. 6.</note> and then <hi>they that are not his: *Blessed and holy is
he that hath his part in the first Resurrection:</hi> There is a first and a second
Resurrection even after this life; <hi>The dead in Christ shall rise first:</hi> Now
blessed are they that have their portion here;<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>for upon these the second
death shall have no power.</hi> As for the recalling the wicked from their
Graves, it is no otherwise in the sense of the Spirit to be called a Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
than taking a Criminal from the Prison to the Bar, is a giving of
Liberty. When poor <hi>Attilius Aviola</hi> had been seized on by an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy,
his friends supposing him dead carried him to his Funeral pile;
but when the fire began to approach, and the heat to warm the body, he
revived, and seeing himself incircled with Funeral flames, called out aloud
to his friends to rescue, not the <hi>dead,</hi> but the <hi>living</hi> Aviola <hi>from that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
burning: But it could not be, he only was restored from his sickness to
fall into death, and from his dull disease to a sharp and intolerable torment.</hi>
Just so shall the wicked live again; they shall receive their Souls, that
they may be a portion for Devils; they shall receive their bodies, that
they may feel the everlasting burning; they shall see Christ, that they
may <hi>look on him whom they have pierced;</hi> and they shall hear the
voice of God passing upon them the intolerable sentence; they shall
come from their Graves, that they may go into Hell; and live again,
that they may die for ever. So have we seen a poor condemned Criminal,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56643:72"/>
the weight of whose sorrows sitting heavily upon his soul, hath benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
him into a deep sleep, till he hath forgotten his groans, and laid aside
his deep sighings; but on a sudden comes the Messenger of death, and
unbinds the Poppy Garland, scatters the heavy Cloud that incircled his
miserable head, and makes him return to acts of life, that he may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
descend into death and be no more. So is every Sinner that lies down
in shame, and makes his grave with the wicked; he shall indeed rise
again, and be call'd upon by the voice of the Archangel; but then he
shall descend into sorrows greater than the reason and the patience of a
man, weeping and shrieking louder than the groans of the miserable chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in the Valley of <hi>Hinnom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These indeed are sad stories, but true as the voice of God, and the
Sermons of the Holy Jesus. They are Gods Words, and Gods Decrees;
and I wish that all who profess the belief of these, would consider sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what they mean. If ye believe the Article of the Resurrection, then
you know that in your body you shall receive what you did in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
whether it be good or bad. It matters not now very much whether
our bodies be beauteous or deformed; for if we glorifie God in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
God shall make our bodies glorious. It matters not much whether
we live in ease and pleasure, or eat nothing but bitter herbs; the body
<hi>that lies in dust and ashes, that goes stooping and feeble,</hi> that lodges at the
foot of the Cross, and dwells in discipline, shall be <hi>feasted at the eternal
Supper of the Lamb.</hi> And ever remember this, That beastly pleasures,
and lying lips, and a deceitful tongue, and a heart that sendeth forth proud
things, are no good dispositions to a blessed Resurrection.

said <hi>Phocyllides;</hi> for we hope that from our beds of darkness we shall rise
into Regions of light, and shall become like unto God: They shall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of a Resurrection to life; and what this can infer is very obvious:
For if it be so hard to believe a Resurrection from one death, let us not
be dead in trespasses and sins; for a Resurrection from two deaths will
be harder to be believed, and harder to be effected. But if any of you
have lost the life of Grace, and so forfeited all your title to a life of
Glory, betake your selves to an early and an entire Piety, that when by
this first Resurrection you have made this way plain before your face,
you may with confidence expect a happy Resurrection from your
graves: For if it be possible that the Spirit, when it is dead in sin, can
arise to a life of Righteousness; much more it is easie to suppose, that the
body after death is capable of being restor'd again: And this is a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Argument, Rom. 5. 10. <hi>If when ye were enemies ye
were reconciled by his death, much more being reconciled we shall be saved
by his life;</hi> plainly declaring, that it is a harder and more wonderful
thing for a wicked man to become the friend of God, than for one that
is so, to be carried up to heaven and partake of his Glory. The first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
is certainly the greater miracle: But he that hath risen once,
may rise again; and this is as sure as that he that dies once, may die again,
and die for ever. But he who partakes of the death of Christ by Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and of his Resurrection by holiness of life and a holy Faith, shall,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56643:73"/>
according to the expression of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Isa. 26. 20. <hi>Enter into
his chamber of death;</hi> when Nature and Gods decree <hi>shall shut the doors
upon him, and there he shall be hidden for a little moment:</hi> But then shall
they that dwell in dust awake and sing, with Christs dead body shall
they arise; all shall rise, but <hi>every man in his own order; Christ the first
fruits, then they that are Christ's at his coming.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>I have now done with my meditation of the Resurrection; but we
have a new and a sadder subject to consider. It is glorious and brave
when a Christian contemplates those Glories which stand at the foot of
the Account of all Gods Servants; but when we consider, that before all
or any thing of this happens, every Christian must twice <hi>exuere hominem,</hi>
put off the Old man, and then lie down in dust, and the dishonours of
the grave, it is <hi>Vinum Myrrhatum,</hi> there is Myrrhe put into our Wine;
it is wholsom, but it will allay all our pleasures of that glorious expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But no man can escape it. After that the Great <hi>Cyrus</hi> had Rul'd
long in a mighty Empire, yet there came a Message from Heaven, not

of us all can avoid this Sentence: For if Wit and Learning, great Fame
and great Experience; if wise Notices of Things, and an honourable
Fortune; if Courage and Skill, if Prelacy and an honourable Age, if
any thing that could give Greatness and Immunity to a wise and prudent
Man, could have been put in bar against a sad day, and have gone for
good plea, this sad Scene of Sorrows had not been the entertainment of
this Assembly. But tell me, Where are those great Masters, who while
they liv'd, flourish'd in their studies? <hi>Jam eorum Praebendas alii possident,

their Dignities, and who knows whether ever they remember them or
no? While they liv'd they seem'd nothing; when they are dead every
man for a while speaks of them what they please, and afterwards they
are as if they had not been. But the piety of the Christian Church
hath made some little provision towards an artificial Immortality for
brave and worthy persons; and the Friendships which our dead contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
while they were alive, require us to continue a fair memory as long
as we can; but they expire in monthly minds, or at most in a faint and
declining Anniversary;

And we have great reason so to do in this present sad accident of the
death of our late most Reverend Primate, whose death the Church of
<hi>Ireland</hi> hath very great reason to deplore; and we have great obligation
to remember his very many worthy Deeds done for this poor afflicted
and despised Church. St. <hi>Paul</hi> made an excellent Funeral Oration, as
it were instituting a Feast of All Saints, <hi>Who all died having obtained a
good report:</hi> And that excellent Preacher in the 11. <hi>cap.</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
made a Sermon of their Commemoration. For since good men, while
they are alive, have their Conversation in Heaven; when they are in
Heaven 'tis also fit that they should in their good Names live upon Earth.
And as their great Examples are an excellent Sermon to the living, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56643:73"/>
the praising them when Envy and Flattery can have no Interest to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as it is the best and most vigorous Sermon and Incentive to great
things; so to conceal what good God hath wrought by them, is great
unthankfulness to God and to good men.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Dorcas</hi> died, the Apostle came to see the dead Corps, and the
Friends of the deceased expressed their grief and their love by shewing
the Coats that she, whilst she lived, wrought with her own hands: She
was a good Needle-woman and a good Huswife, and did good to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in her little way, and that it self ought not to be forgotten; and
the Apostle himself was not displeased with their little Sermons, and
that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> which the women made upon that sad interview. But if
we may have the same liberty to record the worthy things of this our
most venerable Father and Brother, and if there remains no more of
that Envy which usually obscures the splendour of living Heroes; if you
can with your charitable, though weeping, eyes behold the great gifts of
God with which he adorned this great Prelate, and not object the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of humanity to the participation of the Graces of the Spirit, or think
that Gods Gifts are the less because they are born in earthen Vessels,

                     </gap>, for all men bear Mortality about
them, and the Cabinet is not so beauteous as the Diamond that shines
within its bosom; then we may without interruption pay this duty to
Piety, and Friendship, and Thankfulness, and deplore our sad loss by
telling a true and sad story of this great man, whom God hath lately
taken from our eyes.</p>
                  <p>He was bred in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in <hi>Sidney-Colledge,</hi> under Mr. <hi>Hulet,</hi> a grave
and a worthy man; and he shewed himself not only a fruitful Plant by
his great progress in his Studies, but made him another return of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
taking care to provide a good Imployment for him in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
where he then began to be greatly interested. It was spoken as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> that he gave his Tutor an honourable Funeral;
and <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> erected a Statue unto his; and <hi>Gratian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
made his Master <hi>Ausonius</hi> to be <hi>Consul:</hi> And our worthy Primate,
knowing the Obligation which they pass upon us, who do <hi>Obstetricare
gravidae animae,</hi> help the parturient Soul to bring forth Fruits according
to its seminal powers, was careful not only to reward the industry of
such persons so useful to the Church in the cultivating <hi>infantes palmarum,</hi>
young Plants, whose joynts are to be stretch'd and made streight; but
to demonstrate that his Scholar knew how to value Learning, when he
knew so well how to reward the Teacher.</p>
                  <p>Having pass'd the course of his Studies in the University, and done his
Exercise with that applause which is usually the Reward of pregnant
Wits and hard Study, he was remov'd into <hi>York-shire,</hi> where first in the
City of <hi>York</hi> he was an assiduous Preacher; but by the disposition of
the Divine Providence he hapned to be engaged at <hi>North-Alerton</hi> in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation
with three pragmatical Romish Priests of the Jesuits Order,
whom he so much worsted in the Conference, and so shamefully disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged
by the evidence of Truth, represented wisely and learnedly,
that the famous Primate of <hi>York,</hi> Archbishop <hi>Matthews,</hi> a learned and
an excellent Prelate, and a most worthy Preacher, hearing of that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
sent for him and made him his Chaplain; in whose Service he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
till the death of the Primate, but in that time had given so much
testimony of his dexterity in the conduct of Ecclesiastical and Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
that he grew dear to his Master. In that Imployment he was
made Prebendary of <hi>York,</hi> and then of <hi>Rippon,</hi> the Dean of which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56643:74"/>
Church having made him his Sub-Dean, he managed the Affairs of that
Church so well that he soon acquired a greater fame, and entred into
the possession of many hearts, and admiration to those many more that
knew him. There and at his Parsonage he continued long to do the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a learned and good Preacher, and by his Wisdom, Eloquence,
and Deportment, so gain'd the affections of the Nobility, Gentry, and
Commons of that Country, that as at his return thither upon the blessed
Restauration of His most Sacred Majesty he knew himself oblig'd enough,
and was so kind as to give them a Visit; so they by their coming in great
numbers to meet him, their joyful Reception of him, their great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressing
of him when he was there, their forward hopes to enjoy him as
their Bishop, their trouble at his Departure, their unwillingness to let
him go away, gave signal testimonies that they were wise and kind
enough to understand and value his great worth.</p>
                  <p>But while he lived there he was like a Diamond in the dust (or <hi>Lucius
Quinctius</hi> at the Plough); his low Fortune cover'd a most valuable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
till he became observ'd by Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> Lord President of
<hi>York,</hi> whom we all knew for his great Excellencies, and his great but
glorious Misfortunes. This rare Person espied the great Abilities of
Doctor <hi>Bramhall,</hi> and made him his Chaplain, and brought him into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as one whom he believ'd would prove the most fit Instrument to
serve in that design which for two years before his arrival here he had
greatly meditated and resolved, the Reformation of Religion, and the
Reparation of the broken Fortunes of the Church: The Complaints
were many, the Abuses great, the Causes of the Church vastly nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
but as fast as they were brought in, so fast they were by the Lord
Deputy referred back to Dr. <hi>Bramhall,</hi> who by his indefatigable Pains,
great Sagacity, perpetual Watchfulness, daily and hourly Consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
reduc'd things to a more tolerable condition than they had been
left in by the schismatical Principles of some, and the unjust Preposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of others, for many years before: For at the Reformation the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Bishops and Priests seemed to conform, and did so, that keeping their
Bishopricks they might enrich their Kindred and dilapidate the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of the Church, which by pretended Offices, false Informations,
Fee-farms at contemptible Rents, and ungodly Alienations, were made
low as Poverty it self, and unfit to minister to the needs of them that
serv'd the Altar, or the noblest purposes of Religion: For Hospitality
decayed, and the Bishops were easie to be oppressed by those that
would; and they complained, but for a long time had no helper, till
God raised up that glorious Instrument the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who
brought over with him as great affections to the Church and to all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Interests, and as admirable Abilities, as ever before his time did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
and adorn any of the Kings Vice-gerents; and God fitted his hand
with an Instrument good as his Skill was great: for the first Specimen of
his Abilities and Diligence in recovery of some lost Tithes, being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to His late Majesty of blessed and glorious Memory, it pleased
His Majesty upon the death of Bishop <hi>Downham</hi> to advance the Doctor
to the Bishoprick of <hi>Derry,</hi> which he not only adorned with an excellent
Spirit and a wise Government, but did more than double the Revenue,
not by taking any thing from them to whom it was due, but by resuming
something of the Churches Patrimony, which by undue means was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in unfitting hands.</p>
                  <p>But his care was beyond his Diocese, and his zeal broke out to warm
all his Brethren; and though by reason of the Favour and Piety of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56643:74"/>
King <hi>James</hi> the escheated Counties were well provided for their Tithes,
yet the Bishopricks were not so well till the Primate, then Bishop of
<hi>Derry,</hi> by the favour of the Lord Lieutenant and his own incessant and
assiduous labour and wise conduct, brought in divers Impropriations,
cancelled many unjust Alienations, and did restore them to a condition
much more tolerable; I say much more tolerable; for though he raised
them above contempt, yet they were not near to envy; but he knew
there could not in all times be wanting too many that envied to the
Church every degree of prosperity: so <hi>Judas</hi> did to Christ the expence
of Oyntment, and so <hi>Dionysius</hi> told the Priest, when himself stole the
golden Cloak from <hi>Apollo,</hi> and gave him one of <hi>Arcadian</hi> home-spun,
that it was warmer for him in Winter and cooler in Summer. And for
ever, since the Church by Gods blessing and the favour of Religious
Kings and Princes, and Pious Nobility, hath been endowed with fair
Revenues, <hi>inim icus homo,</hi> the Enemy hath not been wanting by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of Religion to take away Gods portion from the Church, as if
his Word were intended as an instrument to rob his Houses. But when
the <hi>Israelites</hi> were governed by a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and God was their King, and
<hi>Moses</hi> his Lieutenant, and things were of his management, he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by making great Provisions for them that ministred in the service of
the Tabernacle to consign this truth for ever; That Men, as they love
God, at the same rate are to make provisions for his Priests. For when
himself did it, he not only gave the 48 Cities, with a mile of <hi>Glebe</hi> round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their City every way, and yet the whole Country was but 140 miles
long, or thereabouts from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beersheba;</hi> but beside this they had the
Tithe of all encrease, the first Fruits, Offerings, Vows, Redemptions,
and in short, they had 24 sorts of Dues, as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> relates; and all this
either brought to the Barn home to them without trouble, or else as the
nature of the thing required, brought to the Temple; the first to make
it more profitable, and the second to declare that they received it not
from the people but from God, not the Peoples kindness but the Lords
inheritance; insomuch that this small Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> which was not the
40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of the People, as the Scripture computes them,<note place="margin">Numb. 1. 46. 3. 39.</note> had a Revenue
almost treble to any of the largest of the Tribes. I will not insist on
what <hi>Villalpandus</hi> observes, it may easily be read in the 45.<note place="margin">Seld. Hist. of Tythes, c. 2.</note> of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
concerning that portion which God reserves for himself and his service;
but whatsoever it be this I shall say, that it is confessedly a Prophecy of
the Gospel; but this I add, that they had as little to do, and much less
than a Christian Priest, and yet in all the 24 courses the poorest Priest
amongst them might be esteemed a rich man.<note place="margin">

I speak not this to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
any man or any thing but Sacriledge and Murmur, nor to any
other end but to represent upon what great and Religious grounds the
then Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi> did with so much care and assiduous labour endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to restore the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> to that splendor and fulness;
which as it is much conducing to the honour of God and of Religion,
God himself being the Judge, so it is much more necessary for you than
it is for us, and so this wise Prelate rarely well understood it; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the same advantage and blessing as we now have, a gracious King,
and a Lieutenant Patron of Religion and the Church, he improved the
<hi>deposita pietatis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tract. 25. in S. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     </note> as <hi>Origen</hi> calls them, the Gages of Piety, which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of the ancient Princes and Nobles of this Kingdom had bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
given to such a comfortable competency, that though there be
place left for present and future Piety to enlarge it self, yet no man
hath reason to be discouraged in his duty; insomuch that as I have
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56643:75"/>
heard from a most worthy hand, that at his going into <hi>England</hi> he gave
account to the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> of 30000 <hi>l.</hi> a year, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of which he was greatly and principally instrumental. But the
goods of this World are called waters by <hi>Solomon:</hi> Stollen waters are
sweet, and they are too unstable to be stopt: some of these waters did
run back from their proper Channel, and return to another course than
God and the Laws intended; yet his labours and pious Counsels were not
the less acceptable to God and good men, and therefore by a thankful
and honourable recognition, the Convocation of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi>
hath transmitted in Record to posterity their deep resentment of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
services and great abilities in this whole affair. And this honour
will for ever remain to that Bishop of <hi>Derry;</hi> he had a <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> who
repaired the Temple and restored its beauty, but he was the <hi>Joshua,</hi> the
High-Priest, who under him ministred this blessing to the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>But his care was not determined in the exterior part only, and Acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
of Religion; he was careful, and he was prosperous in it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
that Divine and excellent Service of our Church to publick and
constant Exercise, to Unity and Devotion; and to cause the Articles of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be accepted as the Rule of publick confessions
and perswasions here, that they and we might be <hi>Populus unius labii,</hi> of
one heart and one lip, building up our hopes of Heaven on a most holy
Faith; and taking away that <hi>Shibboleth</hi> which made this Church lisp too
undecently, or rather in some little degree to speak the speech of <hi>Ashdod,</hi>
and not the language of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and the excellent and wise pains he
took in this particular no man can dehonestate or reproach, but he that
is not willing to confess that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the best Reformed
Church in the world. But when the brave Roman Infantry under the
Conduct of <hi>Manlius</hi> ascended up to the Capitol to defend Religion and
their Altars from the fury of the Gauls, they all prayed to God, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admodum
ipsi ad defendendum templum ejus concurrissent, ita ille virtutem
eorum numine suo tueretur:</hi> That as they came to defend his Temple by
their Arms, so he would defend their Persons and that Cause with his
Power and Divinity. And this excellent man in the Cause of Religion
found the like blessing which they prayed for; God by the prosperity
of his labours and a blessed effect gave testimony not only of the Piety
and Wisdom of his purposes, but that he loves to bless a wise Instrument
when it is vigorously employed in a wise and religious labour. He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the difficulty in defiance of all such pretences as were made even
from Religion it self to obstruct the better procedure of real and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Religion.</p>
                  <p>These were great things and matter of great envy, and like the fiery
eruptions of <hi>Vesuvius</hi> might with the very ashes of Consumption have
buried another man. At first indeed, as his blessed Master the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Jesus had, so he also had his <hi>Annum acceptibilem.</hi> At first the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
was nothing but great admiration at his stupendious parts, and
wonder at his mighty diligence and observation of his unusual zeal in
so good and great things; but this quickly passed into the natural
daughters of Envy, Suspicion and Detraction, the Spirit of Obloquy
and Slander. His zeal for recovery of the Church Revenues was called
Oppression and Rapine, Covetousness and Injustice; his care of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Religion to wise and justifiable principles was called Popery and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianism,
and I know not what names, which signifie what the Authors
are pleased to mean, and the people to construe and to hate. The interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56643:75"/>
prosperity of his Person and Fortune, which he had as an earnest
of a greater reward to so well-meant labours, was supposed to be the
production of Illiberal Arts and ways of getting; and the necessary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment
of his wearied spirits, which did not always supply all his
needs, and were sometimes less than the permissions even of prudent
charity, they called Intemperance: <hi>Dederunt enim malum Metelli Nevio
poetae;</hi> their own surmises were the Bills of Accusation, and the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of his great <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or Doing of good works, was the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of all their Calumnies. But if Envy be the accuser, what can
be the defences of Innocence?
<q>

                  <p>Our Blessed Saviour knowing the unsatisfiable angers of men if their
Money or Estates were medled with, refused to divide an Inheritance
amongst Brethren: it was not to be imagined that this great person (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested,
as all his Brethren were, with the infirmities of Mortality, and
yet employed in dividing and recovering and apportioning of Lands)
should be able to bear all that reproach which Jealousie and Suspicion,
and malicious Envy could invent against him. But <gap reason="foreign">

said <hi>Sophocles:</hi> And so did he; the Affrightments brought to
his great Fame and Reputation made him to walk more warily, and do
justly, and act prudently, and conduct his affairs by the measures of
Laws, as far as he understood, and indeed that was a very great way:
but there was <hi>Aperta justitia, clausa manus,</hi> Justice was open, but his
Hand was shut; and though every Slanderer could tell a story, yet
none could prove that ever he received a Bribe to blind his eyes, to the
value of a pair of Gloves: It was his own Expression, when he gave
glory to God who had preserved him innocent. But because every
mans Cause is right in own eyes, it was hard for him so to acquit himself,
that in the Intriques of Law and difficult Cases some of his Enemies
should not seem (when they were heard alone) to speak reason against
him. But see the greatness of Truth and Prudence, and how greatly
God stood with him. When the numerous Armies of vexed people,

heaped up Catalogues of Accusations, when the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi>
imitating the violent procedures of the then disordered <hi>English,</hi> when
his glorious Patron was taken from his head, and he was disrobed of his
great defences; when Petitions were invited and Accusations furnished,
and Calumny was rewarded and managed with art and power, when
there were above 200 Petitions put in against him, and himself denyed
leave to answer by word of mouth; when he was long imprisoned, and
treated so that a guilty man would have been broken into affrightment
and pitiful and low considerations; yet then he himself standing almost
alone, like <hi>Calimachus</hi> at <hi>Marathon</hi> invested with enemies and covered
with arrows, defended himself beyond all the powers of guiltiness, even
with the defences of Truth and the bravery of Innocence, and answered
the Petitions in writing, sometimes twenty in a day, with so much clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
evidence of truth, reality of Fact and Testimony of Law, that
his very Enemies were ashamed and convinced; they found they had
done like <hi>Aesops</hi> Viper, they licked the file till their tongues bled; but
himself was wholly invulnerable. They were therefore forced to leave
their muster-rolls and decline the particulars, and fall to their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56643:76"/>
accuse him for going about to subvert the fundamental Laws; the way
by which great <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Canterbury</hi> fell; which was a device, when
all reasons fail'd, to oppress the Enemy by the bold affirmation of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
they could not prove: they did like those <hi>Gladiatores</hi> whom the
Romans call'd <hi>Retiaries,</hi> when they could not stab their Enemies with
their Daggers, they threw Nets over him, and cover'd him with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
mischief. But the Martyr King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, of most Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Eternal Memory, seeing so great a Champion likely to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
with numbers and despair, sent what rescue he could, His Royal
Letter for his Bail, which was hardly granted to him; and when it was,
it was upon such hard terms, that his very delivery was a persecution.
So necessary it was for them, who intended to do mischief to the Publick,
to take away the strongest Pillars of the House. This thing I remark to
acquit this great man from the Tongue of slander, which had so boldly
spoken, that it was certain something would stick; yet was so impotent
and unarmed, that it could not kill that great Fame which his greater
Worthiness had procur'd him. It was said of <hi>Hippasus</hi> the <hi>Pythagorean,</hi>
that being asked how and what he had done, he answered, <hi>Nondum nihil,
neque enim adhuc mihi invidetur;</hi> I have done nothing yet, for no man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies

Envy; but if Calumnies must pass for Evidences, the bravest Hero's
must always be the most reproached Persons in the World.

                  <p>Every thing can have an ill name and an ill sense put upon it; but
God, who takes care of Reputations as he does of Lives, by the orders
of his Providence confutes the slander, <hi>ut memoria justorum sit in bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionibus,</hi>
that the memory of the righteous man might be embalm'd
with honour: And so it hapned to this great man; for by a publick
Warranty, by the concurrent Consent of both Houses of Parliament,
the Libellous Petitions against him, the false Records and publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of injurious shame were cancell'd, and he was restor'd <hi>in inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum</hi>
to that Fame where his great Labours and just Procedures had first
estated him; which, though it was but justice, yet it was also such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that it is greater than the virulence of tongues, which his worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and their envy had arm'd against him.</p>
                  <p>But yet the great Scene of the troubles was but newly opened. I shall
not refuse to speak yet more of his troubles, as remembring that S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
when he discourses of the glories of the Saints departed, he tells more
of their Sufferings than of their Prosperities, as being that Laboratory
and Crysable in which God makes his Servants Vessels of honour to his
glory. The storm quickly grew high; <hi>&amp; transitum est à linguis ad gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dios;</hi>
and that was indeed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Iniquity had put on arms;
when it is <hi>armata nequitia,</hi> then a man is hard put to it. The Rebellion
breaking out, the Bishop went to his Charge at <hi>Derry;</hi> and because he
was within the defence of Walls, the execrable Traitor Sir <hi>Phelim ô
Neale</hi> laid a snare to bring him to a dishonourable death; for he wrote a
Letter to the Bishop, pretended Intelligence between them, desir'd that
according to their former Agreement such a Gate might be deliver'd to
him. The Messenger was not advis'd to be cautious, nor at all instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the art of Secrecy; for it was intended that he should be search'd,
intercepted, and hang'd for ought they car'd: but the Arrow was shot
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56643:76"/>
against the Bishop, that he might be accused for base Conspiracy, and
die with shame and sad dishonour. But here God manifested his mighty
care of his Servants; he was pleased to send into the heart of the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
such an affrightment, that he directly ran away with the Letter,
and never durst come neer the Town to deliver it. This story was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> himself, who added, That if he could have thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snar'd
the Bishop, he had good assurance the Town should have been his
own: <hi>Sed bonitas Dei praevalitura est super omnem malitiam hominis;</hi>
The goodness of God is greater than all the malice of men; and nothing
could so prove how dear that sacred Life was to God, as his rescue from
the dangers. <hi>Stantia non poterant tecta probare Deos:</hi> To have kept him
in a warm house had been nothing, unless the roof had fallen upon his
head; that rescue was a remark of Divine Favour and Providence. But
it seems Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s Treason against the Life of this worthy Man had a
Correspondent in the Town; and it broke out speedily; for what they
could not effect by malicious stratagem, they did in part by open force;
they turned the Bishop out of the Town, and upon trifling and unjust
pretences search'd his Carriages, and took what they pleas'd, till they
were asham'd to take more: they did worse than divorce him from his
Church; for in all the Roman Divorces they said, <hi>Tuas tibi res habeto,</hi>
Take your Goods and be gone; but Plunder was Religion then. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
though the usage was sad, yet it was recompenced to him by his
taking Sanctuary in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was graciously receiv'd by that
most incomparable and divine Prince; but having served the King in
<hi>York-shire</hi> by his Pen, and by his Counsels, and by his Interests, return'd
back to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where under the excellent Conduct of his Grace the
now Lord Lieutenant, he ran the risque and fortune of oppressed Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                  <p>But God having still resolv'd to afflict us, the good man was forc'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fortune of the Patriarchs, to leave his Country and his Charges,
and seek for safety and bread in a strange Land; for so the Prophets were
us'd to do, wandring up and down in sheeps-cloathing; but poor as they
were, the World was not worthy of them: and this worthy man, despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the shame, took up his Cross and followed his Master.
<q>
                        <l>Exilium causa ipsa jubet sibi dulce videri,</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was not ashamed to suffer where the Cause was honourable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
but so God provided for the needs of his Banished, and sent a man
who could minister comfort to the afflicted, and courage to the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
and resolutions to the tempted, and strength to that Religion for
which they all suffered.</p>
                  <p>And here this great man was indeed triumphant; this was one of the
last and best Scenes of his life: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, The last
days are the best witnesses of a man. But so it was, that he stood up in
publick and brave defence for the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church
of <hi>England;</hi> First, by his Sufferings and great Example; for, <hi>Verbis
tantùm philosophari, non est Doctoris, sed Histrionis;</hi> To talk well and not
to do bravely, is for a Comedian, not a Divine: But this great man did
both; he suffered his own Calamity with great courage, and by his wise
Discourses strengthened the hearts of others.</p>
                  <p>For there wanted not diligent Tempters in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
taking advantage of the Afflictions of His Sacred Majesty, in which state
Men commonly suspect every thing, and like men in sickness are willing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56643:77"/>
to change from side to side, hoping for ease and finding none, flew at
Royal Game, and hop'd to draw away the King from that Religion
which His most Royal Father, the best Man and the wisest Prince in the
World, had seal'd with the best Blood in <hi>Christendom,</hi> and which Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
suck'd in with His Education, and had confirm'd by Choice and
Reason, and confess'd publickly and bravely, and hath since restor'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously.
<hi>Millitiere</hi> was the man, witty and bold enough to attempt a
zealous and a foolish undertaking, who addressed himself with ignoble,
indeed but witty, Arts to perswade the King to leave what was dearer to
Him than His Eyes. It is true, it was a Wave dash'd against a Rock, and
an Arrow shot against the Sun, it could not reach him; but the Bishop of
<hi>Derry</hi> turn'd it also, and made it fall upon the Shooters head; for he made
so ingenious, so learned, and so acute Reply to that Book; he so disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the Errors of the Roman Church, retorted the Arguments, stated
the Questions, demonstrated the Truth, and sham'd their Procedures,
that nothing could be a greater Argument of the Bishops Learning, great
Parts, deep Judgment, quickness of Apprehension, and Sincerity in the
Catholick and Apostolick Faith; or of the Follies and Prevarications of
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He worte no Apologies for himself, though it
were much to be wished that, as <hi>Junius</hi> wrote his own Life, or <hi>Moses</hi> his
own Story, so we might have understood from himself how great things
God had done for him and by him: but all that he permitted to God,
and was silent in his own Defences; <hi>Gloriosius enim est injuriam tacendo
fugere, quàm respondendo superare:</hi> But when the Honour and Conscience
of his King, and the Interest of a true Religion was at stake, the fire
burned within him, and at last he spake with his tongue; he cried out
like the Son of <hi>Croesus,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Take heed and meddle not
with the King; His Person is too sacred, and Religion too dear to him to
be assaulted by vulgar hands. In short, he acquitted himself in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
with so much Truth and Piety, Learning and Judgment, that in those
Papers his Memory will last unto very late succeeding Generations.</p>
                  <p>But this most Reverend Prelate found a nobler Adversary, and a braver
Scene for his Contention: He found that the Roman Priests being weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and baffled by the wise Discourses and pungent Arguments of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Divines, had studiously declined any more to dispute the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Questions against us, but fell at last upon a general Charge, imputing
to the Church of <hi>England</hi> the great crime of Schism; and by this they
thought they might with most probability deceive unwary and unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Readers; for they saw the Schism, and they saw we had left them;
and because they consider'd not the Causes, they resolv'd to out-face us
in the Charge: But now it was that <hi>dignum nactus Argumentum,</hi> having
an Argument fit to employ his great Abilities,
<q>
                        <l>Consecrat hic praesul calamum calami<expan>
                              <am>

                     </q>
the Bishop now dedicates his Labours to the service of God and of his
Church, undertook the Question, and in a full Discourse proves the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not only to be guilty of the Schism, by making it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to depart from them; but they did actuate the Schisms, and
themselves made the first separation in the great point of the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
which was the <hi>Palladium</hi> for which they principally contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
He made it appear that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> were Usurpers of the
Rights of Kings and Bishops; that they brought in new Doctrines in
every Age, that they impos'd their own Devices upon <hi>Christendom</hi> as
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56643:77"/>
Articles of Faith, that they prevaricated the Doctrines of the Apostles,
that the Church of <hi>England</hi> only returned to her Primitive purity, that
she joined with Christ and his Apostles, that she agreed in all the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of the Primitive Church. He stated the questions so wisely,
and conducted them so prudently, and handled them so learnedly, that
I may truly say, they were never more materially confuted by any man,
since the questions have so unhappily disturbed Christendom. <hi>Verum
hoc eos malè ussit:</hi> and they finding themselves smitten under the fifth
rib, set up an old Champion of their own, a <hi>Goliah</hi> to fight against the
Armies of <hi>Israel;</hi> the old Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> known to many of us,
replyed to this excellent Book; but was so answered by a Rejoinder
made by the Lord Bishop of <hi>Derry,</hi> in which he so pressed the former
Arguments, refuted the Cavils, brought in so many impregnable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
and Probations, and added so many moments and weights to
his discourse, that the pleasures of reading the Book would be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
if the profit to the Church of God were not greater.
<q>
                        <l>Flumina tum lactis, tum flumina nectaris ibant,</l>

                  <p>For so <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Riddle was again expounded, <hi>Out of the strong came
meat, and out of the eater came sweetness;</hi> his Arguments were strong,
and the Eloquence was sweet and delectable; and though there start up
another combatant against him, yet he had only the honour to fall by
the hands of <hi>Hector:</hi> still <hi>haeret lateri lethalis arundo;</hi> the headed arrow
went in so far, that it could not be drawn out, but the barbed steel stuck
behind. And whenever men will desire to be satisfied in those great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
the Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi>'s Book shall be his Oracle.</p>
                  <p>I will not insist upon his other excellent writings; but it is known
every where with what Piety and <hi>acumen</hi> he wrote against the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chean
Doctrine of Fatal necessity, which a late witty man had pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to adorn with a new Vizor; but this excellent Person washed off the
Ceruse and the meritricious paintings, rarely well asserted the oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the Divine Providence; and having once more triumphed over his
Adversary <hi>plenus victoriarum &amp; trophaeorum,</hi> betook himself to the more
agreeable attendance upon sacred Offices; and having usefully and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discoursed of the sacred Rite of Confirmation, imposed his hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the most Illustrious Princes, the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and the
Princess Royal, and ministred to them the Promise of the Holy Spirit,
and ministerially established them in the Religion and Service of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Jesus. And one thing more I shall remark, that at his leaving those
Parts upon the Kings Return, some of the Remonstrant Ministers of the
Low Countries coming to take their leaves of this great man, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that by his means the Church of <hi>England</hi> would be kind to them,
he had reason to grant it, because they were learned men, and in many
things of a most excellent belief; yet he reproved them, and gave them
caution against it, that they approached too near and gave too much
countenance to the great and dangerous errors of the Socinians.</p>
                  <p>He thus having served God and the King abroad, God was pleased to
return to the King and to us all, as in the <hi>days of old, and we sung the song
of</hi> David.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In convertendo captivitatem Sion:</hi> When King <hi>David</hi> and all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
returned to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> this great person having trod in the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
was called to drink of the Wine, and as an honorary Reward of his
great services and abilities, was chosen Primate of this National Church:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56643:78"/>
In which time we are to look upon him, as the King and the Kings great
Vicegerent did, as a person concerning whose abilities the World had
too great testimony ever to make a doubt. It is true he was in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clension
of his age and health; but his very Ruines were goodly; and
they who saw the broken heaps of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Theatre, and the crushed
Obelisks, and the old face of beauteous <hi>Philaenium,</hi> could not but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the disordered glories of such magnificent structures, which were
venerable in their very dust.</p>
                  <p>He ever was used to overcome all difficulties, only Mortality was too
hard for him; but still his Vertues and his Spirit was immortal, he still
took great care, and still had new and noble designs, and proposed to
himself admirable things. He governed his Province with great justice
and sincerity;
<q>
                        <l>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus amplo consulens pastor gregi,</l>
                        <l>Somnos tuetur omnium solus vigil.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And had this remark in all his Government, that as he was a great
hater of Sacriledge, so he professed himself a publick Enemy to Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>residence,
and often would declare wisely and religiously against it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
it in no case but of necessity or the greater good of the Church.
There are great things spoken of his Predecessor S. <hi>Patrick,</hi> that he
founded 700 Churches and Religious Convents, that he ordained 5000
Priests, and with his own hands consecrated 350 Bishops. How true
the story is I know not; but we were all witnesses that the late Primate,
whose memory we now celebrate, did by an extraordinary contingency
of Providence in one day consecrate two Arch-Bishops and ten Bishops;
and did benefit to almost all the Churches in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was greatly
instrumental to the Re-endowments of the whole Clergy; and in the
greatest abilities and incomparable industry was inferior to none of his
most glorious Antecessours.</p>
                  <p>Since the Canonization of Saints came into the Church, we find no
Irish Bishop canonized, except S. <hi>Laurence</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and S. <hi>Malachias</hi>
of <hi>Down;</hi> indeed <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Armagh</hi>'s Canonization was propounded,
but not effected; but the Character which was given of that learned
Primate by <hi>Trithemius</hi> does exactly fit this our late Father; <hi>Vir in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
Scripturis eruditus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De scriptor. Eccles.</note> 
                     <hi>secularis Philosophiae jurisque Canonici non ignarus,
clarus ingenio, sermone scholasticus, in declamandis sermonibus ad populum
excellentis industriae:</hi> He was learned in the Scriptures, skill'd in secular
Philosophy, and not unknowing in the Civil and Canon Laws, (in which
studies I wish the Clergy were with some carefulness and diligence still
more conversant) he was of an excellent spirit, a Scholar in his discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
an early and industrious Preacher to the people. And as if there
were a more particular sympathy between their souls, our Primate had
so great a Veneration to his memory, that he purposed, if he had lived,
to have restored his Monument in <hi>Dundalke,</hi> which Time, or Impiety,
or Unthankfulness had either omitted or destroyed. So great a lover
he was of all true and inherent worth, that he loved it in the very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the dead, and to have such great Examples transmitted to the
intuition and imitation of posterity.</p>
                  <p>At his coming to the Primacy he knew he should at first espie little
besides the Ruines of Discipline, a Harvest of thorns, and Heresies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
in the hearts of the People, the Churches possessed by Wolves
and Intruders, Mens hearts greatly estranged from true Religion; and
therefore he set himself to weed the fields of the Church; he treated
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56643:78"/>
the Adversaries sometimes sweetly, sometimes he confuted them learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
sometimes he rebuked them sharply. He visited his Charges di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
and in his own person, not by Proxies and instrumental Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:
<hi>Quaerens non nostra, sed nos, &amp; quae sunt Jesu Christi;</hi> he design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing that we knew of but the Redintegration of Religion, the
Honour of God and the King, the Restoring of collapsed Discipline,
and the Renovation of Faith and the Service of God in the Churches.
And still he was indefatigable, and, even at the last scene of his life,
intended to undertake a Regal Visitation. <hi>Quid enim vultis me otiosum
à Domino comprehendi?</hi> said one; he was not willing that God should
take him unimployed: But, good man, he felt his Tabernacle ready to
fall in pieces, and could go no further, for God would have no more
work done by that hand; he therefore espying this, put his house in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and had lately visited his Diocese, and done what he then could to
put his Charge in order; for he had a good while since received the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death within himself, and knew he was shortly to render an
account of his stewardship; he therefore upon a brisk alarm of death,
which God sent him the last <hi>January,</hi> made his Will; in which, besides
the prudence and presence of spirit manifested in making just and wise
settlement of his Estate, and provisions for his Descendants; at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
and in the trouble of his sickness and circumstances of addressing
death, still kept a special sentiment and made confession of Gods admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
mercies, and gave thanks that God had permitted him to live to
see the blessed Restauration of His Majesty and the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
confessed his Faith to be the same as ever, gave praises to God that he
was born and bred up in this Religion, and prayed to God, and hoped
he should die in the Communion of this Church, which he declar'd to
be the most pure and Apostolical Church in the whole World.</p>
                  <p>He prayed to God to pardon his frailties and infirmities, relied upon
the mercies of God and the merits of Jesus Christ, and with a singular
sweetness resigned up his soul into the hands of his Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>But God, who is the great <hi>Choragus</hi> and Master of the Scenes of Life
and Death, was not pleased then to draw the Curtains; there was an
Epilogue to his Life yet to be acted and spoken. He returned to actions
and life, and went on in the methods of the same procedure as before;
was desirous still to establish the affairs of the Church, complained of
some disorders which he purposed to redress, girt himself to the work;
but though his spirit was willing, yet his flesh was weak; and as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
in the Vespers of Christs Passion, so he in the eye of his own Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
was heavy, not to sleep, but heavy unto death, and looked for
the last warning, which seized on him in the midst of business; and
though it was sudden, yet it could not be unexpected, or unprovided
by surprize, and therefore could be no other than that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which
<hi>Augustus</hi> used to wish unto himself, a civil and well-natured death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

He hoped that the pains of the last Dissolution were little or none; or
if they were, it was full of comfort that they could be but short. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
so to this excellent man; his Passive Fortitude had been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
tried before, and therefore there was the less need of it now;
his active Graces had been abundantly demonstrated by the great and
good things he did, and therefore his last scene was not so laborious,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56643:79"/>
but God called him away something after the manner of <hi>Moses,</hi> which
the Jews express by <hi>Osculum oris Dei,</hi> the Kiss of Gods mouth; that
is, a death indeed fore-signified, but gentle and serene, and without temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>To sum up all; He was a wise Prelate, a learned Doctor, a just Man,
a true Friend, a great Benefactor to others, a thankful Beneficiary
where he was obliged himself. He was a faithful Servant to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
a Loyal Subject to the King, a zealous Assertor of his Religion
against Popery on one side, and Fanaticism on the other. The practice
of his Religion was not so much in Forms and exteriour Ministries,
though he was a great observer of all the publick Rites and Ministries
of the Church, as it was in doing good for others. He was like <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>

he governed his Family well, he gave to all their due of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and duty; he did great benefit to mankind; he had the fate of
the Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> he passed through evil report and good report, as
a deceiver and yet true. He was a man of great business and great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort:

he divided his life into labour and his book; he took care of his
Churches when he was alive, and even after his death, having left 500 <hi>l.</hi>
for the Repair of his Cathedral of <hi>Armagh</hi> and S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heda:</hi>
He was an excellent Scholar, and rarely well accomplished; first
instructed to great excellency by natural parts, and then consummated
by study and experience. <hi>Melanchthon</hi> was used to say, that himself was
a Logician, <hi>Pomeranus</hi> a Grammarian, <hi>Justus Jonas</hi> an Orator, but that
<hi>Luther</hi> was all these. It was greatly true of him, that the single perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
which make many men eminent, were united in this Primate,
and made him illustrious.

nec est mirum ex intervallo magna generari mediocria &amp; in turbam nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia

in him was visible the great lines of <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Judiciousness, of <hi>Jewel</hi>'s
Learning, of the acuteness of Bishop <hi>Andrews.</hi> He was skilled in
more great things than one; and, as one said of <hi>Phidias,</hi> he could not
only make excellent Statues of Ivory, but he could work in Stone and
Brass: He shewed his Equanimity in Poverty, and his Justice in Riches;
he was useful in his Country, and profitable in his Banishment; for as
<hi>Paraeus</hi> was at <hi>Anvilla, Luther</hi> at <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> and S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi>
in their Banishment, S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his retirement at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi>
they were Oracles to them that needed it; so was he in <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> where he was abroad; and beside the particular endearments
which his friends received from him, for he did do relief to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
that wanted, and supplied the Souldiers out of his store in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
when himself could but ill spare it; but he received publick thanks
from the Convocation of which he was President, and publick Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Parliament where he was Speaker; so that although, as

that at least his Mantle may be left behind, and that his Spirit may be
doubled upon his Successor; and that we may all meet together with him
at the right hand of the Lamb, where every man shall receive according
to his deeds, whether they be good or whether they be evil. I conclude
with the words of <hi>Caius Plinius, Equidem beatos puto quibus Deorum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere

                  <p>I Am not ashamed to profess that I pay this part of Service
to your Lordship most unwillingly: for it is a sad office to
be the chief Minister in a house of mourning, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
an interested person with a branch of Cypress and a
bottle of tears. And indeed, my Lord, it were more proportionable
to your needs to bring something that might alleviate or divert your
sorrow, than to dress the Hearse of your Dear Lady, and to furnish
it with such circumstances, that it may dwell with you, and lie in your
Closet, and make your prayers and your retirements more sad and
full of weepings. But because the Divine providence hath taken
from you a person so excellent, a woman fit to converse with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Apostles, with Saints and Martyrs, give me leave to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
you with her Picture, drawn in little and in water-colours,
sullyed indeed with tears and the abrupt accents of a real and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
sorrow; but drawn with a faithful hand, and taken from
the life: and indeed it were too great a loss to be deprived of her
example and of her rule, of the original and of the copy too. The
age is very evil and deserved her not; but because it is so evil, it
hath the more need to have such lives preserved in memory to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
our piety, or upbraid our wickedness. For now that God
hath cut this tree of Paradise down from its seat of earth, yet so
the dead trunk may support a part of the declining Temple, or at
least serve to kindle the fire on the Altar. My Lord, I pray God
this heap of sorrow may swell your piety till it breaks into the
greatest joys of God and of Religion: and remember when you pay
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56643:82"/>
a tear upon the Grave, or to the memory of your Lady (that Dear
and most excellent Soul) that you pay two more: one of repentance
for those things that may have caused this breach; and another of
joy for the mercies of God to your Dear departed Saint, that he hath
taken her into a place where she can weep no more. My Lord, <hi>I

                     <q> For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground
which cannot be gathered up again: neither doth God respect

                  <p>WHen our Blessed Saviour and his Disciples viewed the
Temple, some one amongst them cried out, <hi>Magister
aspice, quales lapides! Master, behold what fair, what
great stones are here!</hi> Christ made no other reply but
foretold their dissolution, and a world of sadness and
sorrow which should bury that whole Nation, when the teeming cloud
of Gods displeasure should produce a storm which was the daughter of
the biggest anger, and the mother of the greatest calamity which ever
crush'd any of the Sons of <hi>Adam;</hi> [<hi>The time shall come that there shall
not be left one stone upon another.</hi>] The whole Temple and the Religion,
the Ceremonies ordained by God, and the Nation beloved by God, and
the Fabrick erected for the Service of God, shall run to their own Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od,
and lye down in their several Graves. Whatsoever had a beginning
can also have an ending, and it shall die, unless it be daily watered with
the Purles flowing from the Fountain of Life, and refreshed with the
Dew of Heaven, and the Wells of God: And therefore God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
a Tree in Paradise to have supported <hi>Adam</hi> in his <hi>artificial Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality:</hi>
Immortality was not in his Nature, but in the Hands and
Arts, in the Favour and Superadditions of God. Man was always the
same mixture of Heat and Cold, of Dryness and Moisture; ever the
same weak thing, apt to feel rebellion in the humours, and to suffer the
evils of a civil war in his body natural: and therefore health and life
was to descend upon him from Heaven, and he was to suck life from a
Tree on Earth; himself being but ingraffed into a Tree of Life, and
adopted into the condition of an immortal Nature: But he that in the
best of his days was but a Cien of this Tree of Life, by his sin was cut
off from thence quickly, and planted upon Thorns, and his portion
was for ever after among the Flowers, which to day spring and look like
health and beauty, and in the evening they are sick, and at night are
dead, and the oven is their grave: And as before, oven from our first
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56643:84"/>
spring from the dust on earth, <hi>we might have died</hi> if we had not been
preserved by the continual flux of a rare providence; so now that we
are reduced to the Laws of our own Nature, <hi>we must needs die.</hi> It is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and therefore necessary: It is become a punishment to us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is unavoidable; and God hath bound the evil upon us by bands
of natural and inseparable propriety,, and by a supervening unalterable
Decree of Heaven; and we are fallen from our privilege, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the condition of Beasts, and Buildings, and common things:
And we see Temples defiled unto the ground, and they die by Sacrilege;
and great Empires die by their own plenty and ease, full Humours, and
factious Subjects; and huge Buildings fall by their own weight, and
the violence of many Winters eating and consuming the Cement, which
is the marrow of their bones; and Princes die like the meanest of their
Servants; and every thing finds a Grave and a Tomb; and the very
Tomb it self dies by the bigness of its pompousness and luxury,
<q>
                        <l>—Phario nutantia pondera saxo</l>
                        <l>Quae cineri vanus dat ruitura labor,</l>
                     </q>
and becomes as friable and uncombined dust as the ashes of the Sinner
or the Saint that lay under it, and is now forgotten in his bed of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And to this Catalogue of mortality Man is inrolled with a [<hi>Statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
est</hi>] <hi>It is appointed for all men to once die, and after death comes judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
And if a Man can be stronger than Nature, or can wrestle with a
Decree of Heaven, or can escape from a divine punishment by his own
arts, so that neither the Power nor the Providence of God, nor the Laws
of Nature, nor the Bands of eternal Predestination can hold him, then
he may live beyond the fate and period of Flesh, and last longer than a
Flower: But if all these can hold us and tie us to conditions, then we
must lay our heads down upon a turf, and entertain creeping things in
the cells and little chambers of our eyes, and dwell with worms till time
and death shall be no more. <hi>We must needs die</hi>] That's our Sentence:
But that's not all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again.</hi>]
Stay,</p>
                  <p>1. We are as water, weak, and of no consistence, always descending,
abiding in no certain place, unless where we are detained with violence;
and every little breath of wind makes us rough and tempestuous, and
troubles our faces; every trifling accident discomposes us; and as the
face of the waters wafting in a storm so wrinkles it self that it makes
upon its forehead furrows deep and hollow like a grave; so do our
great and little cares and trifles first make the wrinkles of old age, and
then they dig a grave for us: And there is in Nature nothing so contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
but it may meet with us in such circumstances, that it may be too
hard for us in our weaknesses; and the sting of a Bee is a weapon sharp
enough to pierce the finger of a child or the lip of a Man; and those
Creatures which Nature hath left without weapons, yet they are armed
sufficiently to vex those parts of men which are left defenceless and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to a Sun-beam, to the roughness of a sowre Grape, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenness
of a Gravel-stone, to the dust of a Wheel, or the unwholsom
breath of a Star looking awry upon a sinner.</p>
                  <p>2. But besides the weaknesses and natural decayings of our bodies,
if chances and contingencies be innumerable, then no man can reckon
our dangers, and the praeternatural causes of our deaths: So that he is
a vain person whose hopes of life are too confidently encreas'd by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56643:84"/>
of his health: and he is too unreasonably timerous, who thinks his
hopes at an end when he dwels in sickness. For men die without rule, and
with and without occasions; and no man suspecting or foreseeing any of
deaths addresses, and no man in his whole condition is weaker than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
A man in a long Consumption is fallen under one of the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and preparations to death: but at the same instant the most health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
person is as neer death, upon a more fatal and a more sudden, but a
less discerned cause. There are but few persons upon whose foreheads
every man can read the sentence of death written in the lines of a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring
sickness, but they (sometimes) hear the passing-bell ring for stronger
men, even long before their own knell calls at the house of their mother
to open her womb, &amp; make a bed for them. No man is surer of to morrow
than the weakest of his brethren: and when <hi>Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Aufidius</hi> stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at the threshold of the Senate and fell down and dyed, the blow
came from Heaven in a cloud; but it struck more suddenly than upon the
poor slave that made sport upon the Theatre with a praemeditated and
fore-described death: <hi>Quod quisque vitet, nunquam homini satis cautum
est in horas.</hi> There are sicknesses that walk in darkness, and there are
exterminating Angels that fly wrapt up in the curtains of immateriality
and an uncommunicating nature; whom we cannot see, but we feel
their force and sink under their Sword, and from Heaven the vail de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
that wraps our heads in the fatal sentence. There is no age of
man but it hath proper to it self some posterns and outlets for death,
besides those infinite and open ports out of which myriads of men and
women every day pass into the dark, and the land of forgetfulness. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy</hi>
hath life but <hi>in effigie,</hi> or like a spark dwelling in a pile of wood:
the candle is so newly lighted, that every little shaking of the taper, and
every ruder breath of air puts it out, and it dies. <hi>Childhood</hi> is so tender,
and yet so unwary; so soft to all the impressions of Chance, and yet so
forward to run into them, that God knew there could be no security
without the care and vigilance of an Angel-keeper: and the eyes of
Parents and the arms of Nurses, the provisions of art, and all the effects
of Humane love and Providence are not sufficient to keep one child from
horrid mischiefs, from strange and early calamities and deaths, unless a
messenger be sent from Heaven to stand sentinel, and watch the very
playings and sleepings, the eatings and drinkings of the Children; and
it is a long time before Nature makes them capable of help: for there are
many deaths, and very many diseases to which poor babes are exposed;
but they have but very few capacities of Physick: to shew that infancy
is as liable to death as old age, and equally exposed to danger, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uncapable of a remedy: with this only difference, that old age hath
diseases incurable by nature, and the diseases of childhood are incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by art; and both the states are the next heirs of death.</p>
                  <p>3. But all the middle way <hi>the case is altered:</hi> Nature is strong, and
Art is apt to give ease and remedy, but still there is no security; and
there the case is not altered. 1. For there are so many diseases in men
that are not understood. 2. So many new ones every year. 3. The
old ones are so changed in circumstances, and intermingled with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
collateral complications. 4. The Symptoms are oftentimes so alike.
5. Sometimes so hidden and fallacious. 6. Sometimes none at all (as in
the most sudden and most dangerous Imposthumations.) 7. And then,
the diseases in the inward parts of the body, are oftentimes such, to
which no application can be made. 8. They are so far off, that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of all medicines can no otherwise come to them, than the effect
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56643:85"/>
and juices of all meats; that is, not till after two or three alterations and
decoctions, which change the very species of the medicament. 9. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all this, very many principles in the art of Physick are so uncertain,
that after they have been believed seven or eight Ages, and that upon
them much of the practice hath been established, they come to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
by a witty man, and others established in their stead; by which
men must practise, and by which three or four generations of men more
(as happens) must live or die. 10. And all this while the men are sick,
and they take things that certainly make them sicker for the present, and
very uncertainly restore health for the future: that it may appear of
what a large extent is humane calamity; when Gods providence hath
not only made it weak and miserable upon the certain stock of a various
nature, and upon the accidents of an infinite contingency; but even
from the remedies which are appointed, our dangers and our troubles
are certainly encreased: so that we may well be likened to water; our
nature is no stronger, our abode no more certain; if the sluces be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>it falls away and runneth apace;</hi> if its current be stopped, it swells
and grows troublesome, and spills over with a greater diffusion; if it
be made to stand still, it putrifies: and all this we do. For,</p>
                  <p>4. In all the process of our health we are running to our grave: we
open our own sluces by viciousness and unworthy actions; we pour in
drink, and let out life; we increase diseases, and know not how to bear
them; we strangle our selves with our own intemperance; we suffer
the fevers and the inflammations of lust, and we quench our souls with
drunkenness; we bury our understandings in loads of meat and surfets:
and then we lie down upon our beds, and roar with pain and disquietness
of our souls: Nay, we kill one anothers souls and bodies with violence
and folly, with the effects of pride and uncharitableness; we live and
die like fools, and bring a new mortality upon our selves; wars and
vexatious cares, and private duells and publick disorders, and every
thing that is unreasonable, and every thing that is violent: so that now
we may add this fourth gate to the Grave: Besides <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Chance,</hi>
and <hi>the mistakes of Art,</hi> men die with their <hi>own Sins,</hi> and then enter into
the Grave in haste and passion, and pull the heavy stone of the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon their own heads. And thus we make our selves like water
spilt on the ground; we throw away our lives as if they were unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
(and indeed most men make them so) we let our years slip through
our fingers like water; and nothing is to be seen, but like a showr of
tears upon a spot of ground; there is a Grave digged, and a solemn
mourning and a great talk in the Neighbourhood, and when the daies
are finished, they shall be, and they shall be remembred, no more: And
that's like water too, when it is spilt, <hi>it cannot be gathered up again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no redemption from the Grave.
<q>
                        <l>—inter se mortales mutua vivunt</l>
                        <l>Et quasi cursores vitäi lampada tradunt.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men live in their course and by turns; their light burns a while, and then
it burns blew and faint, and men go to converse with Spirits, and then
they reach the taper to another; and as the hours of yesterday can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
return again, so neither can the man whose hours they were, and
who lived them over once, he shall never come to live them again, and
live them better. When <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the widows Son of <hi>Naim,</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitha,</hi>
and the Saints that appeared in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at the Resurrection of
our blessed Lord arose, they came into this world, some as stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56643:85"/>
only to make a visit, and all of them to manifest a glory: but
none came upon the stock of a new life, or entred upon the stage as at
first, or to perform the course of a new nature: and therefore it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
that we never read of any wicked person that was raised from
the dead: <hi>Dives</hi> would fain have returned to his brothers house; but
neither he, nor any from him could be sent: but all the rest in the new
Testament (one only excepted) were expressed to have been holy persons,
or else by their age were declared innocent. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of Christ: those souls that appeared at the Resurrection were
the souls of Saints: <hi>Tabitha</hi> raised by S. <hi>Peter</hi> was a charitable and a holy
Christian: and the maiden of twelve years old, raised by our blessed
Saviour, had not entred into the regions of choice and sinfulness: and
the only exception of the widows son, is indeed none at all, for in it
the Scripture is wholly silent; and therefore it is very probable that the
same process was used, God in all other instances having chosen to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie
his miracles of nature to purposes of the Spirit, and in spiritual
capacities. So that although the Lord of Nature did not break the
bands of Nature in some instances, to manifest his glory to succeeding
great and never failing purposes; yet (besides that this shall be no more)
it was also instanced in such persons who were holy and innocent, and
within the verge and comprehensions of the Eternal mercy. We never read
that a wicked person felt such a miracle, or was raised from the Grave
to try the second time for a Crown; but where he fell, there he lay
down dead, and saw the light no more.</p>
                  <p>This consideration I intend to you as a severe Monitor and an advice
of carefulness, that you order your affairs so that you may be partakers
of the first Resurrection; that is, from sin to grace, from the death of
vitious habits, to the vigour, life, and efficacy of an habitual righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
For (as it hapned to those persons in the New Testament now
mentioned, to them (I say) in the literal sense) <hi>Blessed are they that have
part in the first Resurrection, upon them the second death shall have no power:</hi>
meaning that they who by the power of Christ and his holy Spirit were
raised to life again, were holy and blessed souls, and such who were
written in the book of God; and that this grace hapned to no wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and vitious person: so it is most true in the spiritual and intended
sense: You only that serve God in a holy life; you who are not dead in
trespasses and sins; you who serve God with an early diligence and an
unwearied industry, and a holy Religion, you and you only shall come
to life eternal, you only shall be called from death to life; the rest of
mankind shall never live again, but pass from death to death; from one

                     </gap>ities
of the eternal death; It is nothing but a new capacity of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again; such a dying as cannot signifie rest; but where death means
nothing but an intollerable and never ceasing calamity: and therefore
these words of my Text are otherwise to be understood of the wicked,
otherwise of the godly: The wicked are spilt like water and shall never
be gathered up again; no not in the gatherings of eternity; They shall
be put into Vessels of wrath and set upon the flames of hell; but that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56643:86"/>
is not <hi>a gathering,</hi> but <hi>a scattering</hi> from the face and presence of God.
But the godly also come under the sense of these words: They descend
into their Graves, and shall no more be reckoned among the living;
they have no concernment in all that is done under the Sun. <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
hath no more to do with the Turks Armies invading and possessing
that part of <hi>Greece</hi> where he reigned, than had the <hi>Hippocentaur</hi> who
never had a being: and <hi>Cicero</hi> hath no more interest in the present evils
of Christendom, than we have to do with his boasted discovery of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilines</hi>
Conspiracy. What is it to me that <hi>Rome</hi> was taken by the <hi>Gauls?</hi>
and what is it now to <hi>Camillus</hi> if different religions be tolerated amongst
us? These things that now happen concern the living, and they are
made the scenes of our duty or danger respectively: and when our Wives
are dead and sleep in charnel houses, they are not troubled when we
laugh loudly at the songs sung at the next marriage feast; nor do they
envy when another snatches away the gleanings of their husbands pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>It is true, they envy not, and they lie in a bosom where there can be
no murmur; and they that are consigned to Kingdoms, and to the feast
of the marriage-supper of the Lamb, the glorious and eternal Bridegroom
of holy Souls, they cannot think our Marriages here, our lighter laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and vain rejoicings, considerable as to them. And <hi>yet there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
continued still: Aristotle,</hi> said, that to affirm the dead take no
thought for the good of the living, is a disparagement to the laws of
that friendship which in their state of separation they cannot be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to rescind. And the Church hath taught in general, that they pray
for us, they recommend to God the state of all their Relatives, in the
union of the intercession that our blessed Lord makes for them and us:
and S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> gave some things in charge to his dying brother <hi>Satyrus,</hi>
that he should do for him in the other world: he gave it him (I say)
when he was dying, not when he was dead. And certain it is that though
our dead friends affection to us is not to be estimated according to our
low conceptions, yet it is not less, but much more than ever it was; it
is greater in degree, and of another kind.</p>
                  <p>But then we should do well also to remember, that in this world we are
something besides flesh and bloud; that we may not without violent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
run into new relations, but preserve the affections we bore to
our dead when they were alive: We must not so live as if they were
perished, but so as pressing forward to the most intimate participation
of the communion of Saints. And we also have some ways to express
this relation, and to bear a part in this communion, by actions of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with them, aud yet proper to our state: such as are strictly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the will of the dead, providing for, and tenderly and wisely
educating their children, paying their debts, imitating their good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
preserving their memories privately, and publickly keeping their
memorials, and desiring of God with hearty and constant prayer that
God would give them a joyful Resurrection, and a merciful Judgment,
(for so S. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed in behalf of <hi>Onesiphorus</hi>) that <hi>God would shew them</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Tim. 1. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>mercy in that day,</hi> that fearful, and yet much to be desired day, in which
the most righteous person hath need of much mercy and pity, and shall
find it. Now these instances of duty shew that the relation remains
still; and though the Relict of a man or woman hath liberty to contract
new relations, yet I do not find they have liberty to cast off the old,
as if there were no such thing as immortality of souls. Remember that
we shall converse together again; let us therefore never do any thing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56643:86"/>
of reference to them which we shall be ashamed of in the day when all
secrets shall be discovered, and that we shall meet again in the presence
of God: In the mean time, God watcheth concerning all their interest,
and he will in his time both discover and recompense. For though, as
to us, they are like water spilt; yet, to God, they are as water fallen
in the Sea, safe and united in his comprehension, and inclosures.</p>
                  <p>But we are not yet passed the consideration of the sentence: This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
to the grave is the lot of all men, [<hi>neither doth God respect the
person of any man</hi>] The rich is not protected for favour, nor the poor for
pity, the old man is not reverenced for his age, nor the Infant regarded
for his tenderness; youth and beauty, learning and prudence, wit and
strength lie down equally in the dishonours of the Grave. All men,
and all natures, and all persons resist the addresses and solennities of
death, and strive to preserve a miserable and unpleasant life; and yet
they all sink down and die. For so have I seen the Pillars of a Building
assisted with artificial props bending under the pressure of a roof, and
pertinaciously resisting the infallible and prepared ruine,
<q>
                        <l>Donec certa dies omni compage solutâ</l>
                        <l>Ipsum cum rebus subruat auxilium,</l>
                     </q>
Till the determin'd day comes, and then the burden sunk upon the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
and disordered the aids and auxiliary rafters into a common ruine
and a ruder grave: so are the desires and weak arts of man; with little
aids and assistances of care and Physick we strive to support our decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bodies, and to put off the evil day; but quickly that day will come,
and then neither Angels nor men can rescue us from our grave; but the
roof sinks down upon the walls, and the walls descend to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and the beauty of the face, and the dishonours of the belly, the
discerning head and the servile feet, the thinking heart and the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hand, the eyes and the guts together shall be crushed into the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a heap, and dwell with Creatures of an equivocal production,
with worms and serpents, the sons and daughters of our own bones, in
a house of dirt and darkness.</p>
                  <p>Let not us think to be excepted or deferred: If beauty, or wit, or
youth, or nobleness, or wealth, or vertue could have been a defence, and
an excuse from the Grave, we had not met here to day to mourn upon
the Hearse of an Excellent Lady: and God only knows for which of us
next the Mourners shall go about the streets or weep in houses.

                  <p>We have lived so many years; and every day and every minute we
make an escape from those thousands of dangers and deaths that encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
us round about: and such escapings we must reckon to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
fortune, and therefore that it cannot last long. Vain are
the thoughts of Man, who when he is young or healthful, thinks he hath
a long thread of life to run over, and that it is violent and strange for
young persons to die; and natural and proper only for the aged. It is
as natural for a man to die by drowning as by a Fever: And what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
violence or more unnatural thing is it, that the Horse threw his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
into the River, than that a drunken meeting cast him into a Fever?
and the strengths of youth are as soon broken by the strong sicknesses
of youth, and the stronger intemperance, as the weakness of old age
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56643:87"/>
by a Cough, or an Asthma, or a continual Rheum: Nay, it is <hi>more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
for young Men and Women to die, than for old; because that is
<hi>more natural</hi> which hath more natural causes, and that is more natural
which is most common: but to die with age is an extreme rare thing;
and there are more persons carried forth to burial before the five and
thirtieth year of their age, than after it: And therefore let no vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
make you hope for long life: If you have lived but little, and
are still in youth, remember that now you are in your biggest throng of
dangers both of body and soul; and the proper sins of youth to which
they rush infinitely and without consideration, are also the proper and
immediate instruments of death. But if you be old you have escaped
long and wonderfully, and the time of your escaping is out: you must not
for ever think to live upon wonders, or that God will work miracles
to satisfie your longing follies, and unreasonable desires of living longer
to sin and to the world. Go home and think to die, and what you
would choose to be doing when you die, that do daily: for you will all
come to that pass to rejoice that you did so, or wish that you had: that
will be the condition of every one of us; for <hi>God regardeth no mans
person.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well ! but all this you will think is but a sad story: What? we must
die, and go to darkness and dishonour; and we must die quickly, and we
must quit all our delights, and all our sins, or do worse, infinitely worse;
and this is the condition of us all, from which none can be excepted;
every man shall be spilt and fall into the ground, and <hi>be gathered up no
more.</hi> Is there no comfort after all this? <hi>shall we go from hence, and be
no more seen,</hi> and have no recompense?

                  <p>Shall we exchange our fair Dwellings for a Coffin, our softer Beds for

with a house of Gods making; they rest from all their labours; all tears
are wiped from their eyes,</hi> and all discontents from their spirits; and in
the state of separation, before the Soul be re-invested with her new
house, the Spirits of all persons are with God, so secur'd, and so blessed,
and so sealed up for glory, that this state of interval and imperfection is,
in respect of its certain event and end, infinitely more desirable than all
the Riches, and all the Pleasures, and all the Vanities, and all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of this world.</p>
                  <p>I will not venture to determine what are the circumstances of the
abode of Holy Souls in their separate dwellings; and yet possibly that
might be easier than to tell what or how the Soul is and works in this
world, where it is in the Body <hi>tanquam in alienâ domo,</hi> as in a prison, in
fetters and restraints; for here the Soul is discomposed and hindred; it
is not as it shall be, as it ought to be, as it was intended to be; it is not
permitted to its own freedom, and proper operation; so that all that we
can understand of it here, is that it is so incommodated with a troubled
and abated instrument, that the <hi>object</hi> we are to consider cannot be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to us in a right line, in just and equal propositions; or if it could,
yet because we are to understand the Soul by the Soul, it becomes not
only a troubled and <hi>abused object,</hi> but a <hi>crooked instrument;</hi> and we
here can consider it just as a weak eye can behold a staff thrust into the
waters of a troubled River; the very water makes a refraction, and the
storm doubles the refraction, and the water of the eye doubles the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and there is nothing right in the thing; the object is out of its just
place, and the medium is troubled, and the organ is impotent: <hi>At cum
exierit &amp; in liberum coelum quasi in dontum suam venerit;</hi> when the Soul
is entred into her own house, into the free regions of the rest, and the
neighbourhood of heavenly Joys, then its operations are more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
proper, and proportion'd to its being; and though we cannot see
at such a distance, yet the object is more fitted if we had a capable Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
it is in it self in a more excellent and free condition.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that the Body does hinder many actions of the Soul: It
is an imperfect Body, and a diseased Brain, or a violent passion that
makes Fools: No man hath a foolish Soul; and the reasonings of men
have infinite difference and degrees, by reason of the Bodies constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Among Beasts, which have no Reason, there is a greater likeness
than between Men, who have: And as by Faces it is easier to know a
Man from a Man, than a Sparrow from a Sparrow; or a Squirrel from a
Squirrel; so the difference is very great in our Souls; which difference,
because it is not originally in the Soul (and indeed cannot be in simple or
spiritual substances of the same species or kind) it must needs derive
wholly from the Body, from its accidents and circumstances; from
whence it follows, that because the Body casts fetters and restraints,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56643:88"/>
hinderances and impediments upon the Soul, that the Soul is much freer
in the state of separation; and if it hath any act of life, it is much more
noble and expedite.</p>
                  <p>That the Soul is alive after our death,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 10.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, [<hi>Christ died for
us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</hi>] Now
it were strange that we should be alive, and live with <hi>Christ,</hi> and yet do
no act of life: The Body when it is asleep does many; and if the Soul
does none, the Principle is less active than the Instrument; but if it does
any act at all in separation, it must necessarily be an act or effect of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
there is nothing else it can do, but this it can: For it is
but a weak and an unlearned Proposition to say, That the Soul can do
nothing of it self, nothing without the phantasms and provisions of the
Body: For,</p>
                  <p>1. In this life the Soul hath one principle clearly separate, abstracted,
and immaterial; I mean <hi>the Spirit of Grace,</hi> which is a principle of life
and action, and in many instances does not at all communicate with
matter, as in the infusion, superinduction and creation of spiritual Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</p>
                  <p>2. As nutrition, generation, eating and drinking, are actions proper
to the Body and its state; so extasies, visions, raptures, intuitive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
and consideration of its self, acts of volition, and reflex acts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
are proper to the Soul.</p>
                  <p>3. And therefore it is observable, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> said that <hi>he knew not
whether his visions and raptures were in or out of the body;</hi> for by that we
see his judgment of the thing, that one was as likely as the other, neither
of them impossible or unreasonable; and therefore that the Soul is as
capable of action alone as in conjunction.</p>
                  <p>4. If in the state of Blessedness there are some actions of the Soul
which do not pass through the Body, such as contemplation of God,
and conversing with Spirits, and receiving those influences and rare im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
which coming from the Holy and Mysterious Trinity make up
the Crown of Glory; it follows, that the necessity of the Bodies mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
is but during the state of this life, and as long as it converses with
fire and water, and lives with corn and flesh, and is fed by the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of material appetites; which necessity and manner of conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
when it ceases, it can be no longer necessary for the Soul to be served
by phantasms and material representations.</p>
                  <p>5. And therefore when the Body shall be re-united, it shall be so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that then the Body shall confess it gives not any thing, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
all its being and operation, its manner and abode from the Soul;
and that then it comes not to serve a necessity, but to partake a Glory.
For as the operations of the Soul in this life begin in the Body, and by
it the object is transmitted to the Soul; so then they shall begin in the
Soul, and pass to the Body: And as <hi>the operations of the Soul</hi> by reason
of its dependence on the Body are <hi>animal, natural, and material;</hi> so in
the resurrection <hi>the body</hi> shall be <hi>spiritual</hi> by reason of the preeminence,
influence, and prime operation of the Soul. Now between these two
states stands the state of separation, in which the operations of the Soul
are of a middle nature, that is, not so spiritual as in the resurrection, and
not so animal and natural as in the state of conjunction.</p>
                  <p>To all which I add this consideration, That our Souls have the same
condition that Christs Soul had in the state of separation, because he
took on him all our Nature, and all our Condition; and it is certain,
Christs Soul in the three days of his separation did exercise acts of life, of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56643:88"/>
joy and triumph, and did not sleep, but visited the Souls of the Fathers,
trampled upon the pride of Devils, and satisfied those longing Souls
which were <hi>Prisoners of hope:</hi> And from all this we may conclude, That
the Souls of all the Servants of Christ are alive, and therefore do the
actions of life, and proper to their state; and therefore it is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the Soul works clearer, and understands brighter, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
wiser, and rejoyces louder, and loves noblier, and desires purer,
and hopes stronger than it can do here.</p>
                  <p>But if these arguments should fail, yet the felicity of Gods Saints can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fail: For suppose the Body to be a necessary Instrument, but out of
tune and discomposed by sin and anger, by accident and chance, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and imperfections, yet that it is better than none at all; and that if
the Soul works imperfectly with an imperfect Body, that then she works
not at all when she hath none: And suppose also that the Soul should be
as much without sense or perception in death, as it is in a deep sleep,
which is the image and shadow of death; yet then God devises other
means that his banished be not expelled from him. For</p>
                  <p>2. God will restore the Soul to the Body, and raise the Body to such
a perfection that it shall be an Organ fit to praise him upon; it shall be
made spiritual to minister to the Soul, when the Soul is turned into a
Spirit; then the Soul shall be brought forth by Angels from her incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
and easie bed, from her rest in Christs holy Bosom, and be made
perfect in her being, and in all her operations: And this shall first appear
by that perfection which the Soul shall receive as instrumental to the last
Judgment; for then she shall see clearly all the Records of this World,
all the Register of her own Memory: For all that we did in this life is
laid up in our Memories; and though dust and forgetfulness be drawn
upon them, yet when God shall lift us from our dust, then shall appear
clearly all that we have done, written in the Tables of our Conscience,
which is the Souls Memory. We see many times, and in many instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that a great Memory is hindred and put out, and we thirty years
after come to think of something that lay so long under a Curtain; we
think of it suddenly, and without a line of deduction, or proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence:
And all those famous Memories of <hi>Simonides</hi> and <hi>Theodactes,</hi>
of <hi>Hortensius</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> of <hi>Sceptius, Metrodorus,</hi> and <hi>Carneades</hi> of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
the Embassadour of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> are only the Records better kept,
and less disturbed by accident and disease: For even the Memory of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi>
son of <hi>Athens,</hi> of <hi>Bathyllus,</hi> and the dullest person now alive, is so
great, and by God made so sure a Record of all that ever he did, that
as soon as ever God shall but tune our Instrument, and draw the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and but light up the Candle of Immortality, there we shall find
it all, there we shall see all, and the whole world shall see all; then
we shall be made fit to converse with God after the manner of Spirits, we
shall be like to Angels.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, although upon the perswasion of the former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
it be highly probable that the Souls of Gods Servants do live in
a state of present blessedness, and in the exceeding joys of a certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the revelation of the day of the Lord, and the coming of
Jesus; yet it will concern us only to secure our state by holy living,
and leave the event to God, that (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> said) whether present or
absent, whether sleeping or waking, whether perceiving or perceiving
not, we may be accepted of him; that when we are banished this
World, and from the light of the Sun, we may not be expelled from
God, and from the light of his countenance, but that from our beds of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56643:89"/>
sorrows our Souls may pass into the Bosom of Christ, and from thence
to his right hand in the day of Sentence: <hi>For we must all appear before
the judgment seat of Christ;</hi> and then if we have done well in the Body,
we shall never be expelled from the beatifical presence of God, but be
Domesticks of his Family, and Heirs of his Kingdom, and Partakers of
his Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Have now done with my Text, but yet am to make you another
Sermon. I have told you the necessity and the state of death, it
may be too largely for such a sad story; I shall therefore now with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
compendium teach you how to live, by telling you a plain Narative
of a Life, which if you imitate, and write after the Copy, it will make
that death shall not be an evil, but a thing to be desired, and to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
among the purchases and advantages of your Fortune. When
<hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> went to weep over the Grave of their Brother, Christ
met them there, and preached a Funeral Sermon, discoursing of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and applying to the purposes of Faith, and confession of
Christ, and glorification of God. We have no other, we can have no
better precedent to follow: and now that we are come to weep over the
grave of our Dear Sister, this rare Personage, we cannot chuse but have
many virtues to learn, many to imitate, and some to exercise.</p>
                  <p>I chuse not to declare her Extraction and Genealogy; it was indeed
fair and honourable; but having the blessing to be descended from
Worthy and Honour'd Ancestors, and her self to be adopted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed
into a more Noble Family; yet she felt such outward Appenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to be none of hers, because not of her choice, but the purchase of
the Virtues of others, which although they did engage her to do noble
things, yet they would upbraid all degenerate and less honourable
Lives than were those which began and encreased the honour of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.
She did not love her Fortune for making her noble; but thought
it would be a dishonour to her if she did not continue a Nobleness and
Excellency of Virtue fit to be owned by Persons relating to such Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.
It is fit for us all to honour the Nobleness of a Family: but it is
also fit for them that are Noble to despise it, and to establish their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
upon the foundation of doing excellent things, and suffering in
good causes, and despising dishonourable actions, and in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
good things to others: For this is the rule in Nature; Those
Creatures are most honourable which have the greatest power, and do
the greatest good: And accordingly my self have been witness of it,
how this excellent Lady would by an act of humility and Christian ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
strip her self of all that fair Appendage and exteriour Honour
which decked her Person and her Fortune, and desired to be owned by
nothing but what was her own, that she might only be esteemed honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
according to that which is the Honour of a Christian, and a wise
Person.</p>
                  <p>2. She had a strict and severe education, and it was one of Gods
Graces and Favours to her: For being the Heiress of a great Fortune,
and living amongst the throng of persons in the sight of vanities and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
temptations, that is, in that part of the Kingdom where Greatness is
too often express'd in great follies and great vices, God had provided a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and angry Education to chastise the forwardnesses of a young Spirit
and a fair Fortune, that she might for ever be so far distant from a vice,
that she might only see it and loath it, but never taste of it, so much as
to be put to her choice whether she would be virtuous or no. God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56643:89"/>
to secure this Soul to himself, would not suffer the follies of the
world to seize upon her by way of too neer a trial or busie temptation.</p>
                  <p>3. She was married young; and besides her businesses of Religion,
seemed to be ordained in the providence of God to bring to this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Family a part of a fair Fortune, and to leave behind her a fairer
Issue, worth ten thousand times her Portion: And as if this had been all
the publick business of her life, when she had so far served Gods ends,
God in mercy would also serve hers, and take her to an early blessedness.</p>
                  <p>4. In passing through which line of providence, she had the art to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
her eternal Interest, by turning her Condition into Duty, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
her Duty in the greatest eminency of a virtuous, prudent, and
rare affection, that hath been known in any example. I will not give
her so low a testimony, as to say only that she was chast; She was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of that severity, modesty, and close Religion (as to that particular)
that she was not capable of uncivil temptation; and you might as well
have suspected the Sun to smell of the Poppy that he looks on, as that
she could have been a person apt to be sullied by the breath of a soul
question.</p>
                  <p>5. But that which I shall note in her, is that which I would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar
to all Ladies, and to all Women: She had a love so great for her
Lord, so intirely given up to a dear affection, that she thought the same
things, and loved the same loves, and hated according to the same en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and breathed in his soul, and lived in his presence, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
in his absence; and all that she was or did, was only for and
to her dearest Lord:
<q>
                        <l>Si gaudet, si flet, St tacet, hunc loquitur,</l>
                        <l>Coenat, propinat, poscit, negat, innuit, unus</l>
                        <l>Naevius est:—</l>
                     </q>
And although this was a great enamel to the beauty of her Soul, yet it
might in some degrees be also a reward to the Virtue of her Lord: For
she would often discourse it to them that convers'd with her, that he
would improve that interest which he had in her affection to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of God and of Religion; and she would delight to say, that he
called her to her Devotions, he encouraged her good inclinations, he
directed her piety, he invited her with good Books; and then she loved
Religion, which she saw was not only pleasing to God, and an act or
state of duty, but pleasing to her Lord, and an act also of affection and
conjugal obedience; and what at first she loved the more forwardly for
his sake, in the using of Religion, left such relishes upon her spirit, that
she found in it amability enough to make her love it for its own. So
God usually brings us to him by instruments of nature and affections,
and then incorporates us into his Inheritance by the more immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes
of Heaven, and the secret things of the Spirit. He only was (under
God) the light of her eyes, and the cordial of her spirits, and the guide
of her actions, and the measure of her affections, till her affections
swell'd up into a Religion, and then it could go no higher, but was
confederate with those other duties which made her dear to God:
which rare combination of Duty and Religion, I chuse to express in the
words of <hi>Solomon; She forsook not the guide of her youth, nor brake the
Covenant of her God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 2. 17.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. As she was a rare Wife, so she was an excellent Mother: For in so
tender a constitution of spirit as hers was, and in so great a kindness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her Children, there hath seldom been seen a stricter and more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56643:90"/>
care of their persons, their deportment, their nature, their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
their learning, and their customs: And if ever kindness and
care did contest, and make parties in her, yet her care and her severity
was ever victorious; and she knew not how to do an ill turn to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
part, by her more tender and forward kindness. And as her
custom was, she turned this also into love to her Lord: For she was not
only diligent to have them bred nobly and religiously, but also was
careful and sollicitous that they should be taught to observe all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
and inclinations, the desires and wishes of their Father; as
thinking that virtue to have no good circumstances, which was not
dressed by his copy, and ruled by his lines, and his affections: And her
prudence in the managing her children was so singular and rare, that
when ever you mean to bless this family, and pray a hearty and a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
prayer for it, beg of God, that the children may have those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
things which she designed to them, and provided for them in her
heart and wishes, that they may live by her purposes, and may grow
thither, whither she would fain have brought them. All these were
great parts of an excellent Religion, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they concerned her greatest tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
relations.</p>
                  <p>7. But if we examine how she demeaned her self towards God, there
also you will find her not of a common, but of an exemplar piety:
She was a great reader of Scripture, confining her self to great portions
every day; which she read not to the purposes of vanity, and impertinent
curiosities, not to seem knowing, or to become talking, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
and rule; but to teach her all her duty, to instruct her in the
knowledge and love of God and of her Neighbours; to make her more
humble, and to teach her to despise the world and all its gilded vanities;
and that she might entertain passions wholly in design and order to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
I have seen a female Religion that wholly dwelt upon the face and
tongue; that like a wanton and an undressed tree spends all its juice in
suckers and irregular branches, in leafs and gum, and after all such
goodly outsides you should never eat an Apple, or be delighted with
the beauties, or the perfumes of a hopeful blossom. But the Religion
of this excellent Lady was of another constitution; It took root down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in humility, and brought forth fruit upward in the substantial gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a Christian, in Charity and Justice, in Chastity and Modesty, in
fair Friendships and sweetness of Society: She had not very much of the
forms and outsides of godliness, but she was hugely careful for the power
of it, for the moral, essential, and useful parts; such which would make
her be, not seem to be, religious.</p>
                  <p>8. She was a very constant person at her prayers, and spent all her
time which Nature did permit to her choice, in her devotions, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and meditating, and the necessary offices of houshold Government;
every one of which is an action of Religion, some by nature, some by
adoption. To these also God gave her <hi>a very great love to hear the
word of God preached;</hi> in which because I had sometimes the honour to
minister to her, I can give this certain testimony, that she was a diligent,
watchful, and attentive hearer: and to this had so excellent a judgment,
that if ever I saw a woman whose judgment was to be revered, it was
hers alone: and I have sometimes thought that the eminency of her
discerning faculties did reward a pious discourse, and placed it in the
regions of honour and usefulness, and gathered it up from the ground,
where commonly such Homilies are spilt, or scattered in neglect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration.
But her appetite was not soon satisfied with what was
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56643:90"/>
useful to her soul: she was also a constant Reader of Sermons, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
missed to read one every day; and that she might be full of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and holy principles, she had lately designed to have a large Book,
in which she purposed to have a stock of Religion transcribed in such
assistances as she would chuse, that she might be <hi>readily furnished and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
to every good work.</hi> But God prevented that, and hath filled her
desires, not out of Cisterns and little Aquaeducts, but hath carried her to
the Fountain, where <hi>she drinks of the pleasures of the River,</hi> and is full
of God.</p>
                  <p>9. She always lived a life of much innocence, free from the violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of great sins: her person, her breeding, her modesty, her honour,
her Religion, her early marriage, the Guide of her soul, and the Guide
of her youth, were as so many fountains of restraining grace to her, to
keep her from the dishonours of a crime. <hi>Bonum est portare jugum ab
adolescentiâ,</hi> it is good to bear the yoke of the Lord from our youth;
and though she did so, being guarded by a mighty providence, and a
great favour and grace of God from staining her fair soul with the spots
of hell, yet she had strange fears and early cares upon her; but these
were not only for her self, but in order to others, to her neerest Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:
For she was so great a lover of this Honourable Family of which
now she was a Mother, that she desired to become a channel of great
blessings to it unto future ages, and was extremely jealous lest any thing
should be done, or lest any thing had been done, though an Age or two
since, which should intail a curse upon the innocent posterity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(although I do not know that ever she was tempted with an offer of
the crime) yet she did infinitely remove all sacriledge <hi>from her thoughts,</hi>
and delighted to see her estate of a clear and dis-intangled interest: she
would have no mingled rights with it; she would not receive any thing
from the Church, but Religion and a Blessing: and she never thought
a curse and a sin far enough off, but would desire it to be infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant;
and that as to this Family God had given much honour and a wise
head to govern it, so he would also for ever give many more blessings:
and because she knew the sins of Parents descend upon Children, she
endeavoured by justice and religion, by charity and honour to secure
that her channel should convey nothing but health, and a fair example
and a blessing.</p>
                  <p>10. And though her accounts to God were made up of nothing but
small parcels, little passions, and angry words, and trifling discontents,
which are the allays of the piety of the most holy persons; yet she was
early at her repentance; and toward the latter end of her days, grew
so fast in Religion, as if she had had a revelation of her approaching
end, and therefore that she must go a great way in a little time: her
discourses more full of religion, her prayers more frequent, her charity
increasing, her forgiveness more forward, her friendships more commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative,
her passion more under discipline; and so she trimmed her lamp,
not thinking her night was so neer, but that it might shine also in the
day time, in the Temple, and before the Altar of Incense.</p>
                  <p>But in this course of hers there were some circumstances, and some
appendages of substance, which were highly remarkable.</p>
                  <p>1. In all her Religion, and in all her actions of relation towards God,
she had a strange evenness and untroubled passage, sliding toward her
Ocean of God and of infinity with a certain and silent motion. So have
I seen a River deep and smooth passing with a still foot and a sober face,
and paying to the <hi>Fiscus,</hi> the great Exchequer of the Sea, the Prince of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56643:91"/>
all the watry bodies, a tribute large and full: and hard by it a little
brook skipping and making a noise upon its unequal and neighbour bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom;
and after all its talking and bragged motion, it payed to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Audit no more than the Revenues of a little cloud, or a contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vessel: So have I sometimes compared the issues of her Religion to
the solemnities and famed outsides of anothers piety. It dwelt upon her
spirit, and was incorporated with the periodical work of every day: she
did not believe that Religion was intended to minister to fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
but to pardon of sins, to the pleasure of God, and the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of souls. For Religion is like the breath of Heaven; if it goes
abroad into the open air, it scatters and dissolves like Camphyre: but
if it enters into a secret hollowness, into a close conveyance, it is strong
and mighty, and comes forth with vigour and great effect at the other
end, at the other side of this life, in the days of death and judgment.</p>
                  <p>2. The other appendage of her Religion, which also was a great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
to all the parts of her life, was a rare modesty and humility of
spirit, a confident despising and undervaluing of her self. For though
she had the greatest judgment, and the greatest experience of things
and persons that I ever yet knew in a person of her youth, and sex, and
circumstances; yet as if she knew nothing of it, she had the meanest opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of her self; and like a fair taper, when she shined to all the room,
yet round about her own station she had cast a shadow and a cloud, and
she shined to every body but her self. But the perfectness of her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and excellent parts could not be hid; and all her humility, and
arts of concealment, made the vertues more amiable and illustrious.
For as pride sullies the beauty of the fairest vertues, and makes our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
but like the craft and learning of a Devil: so humility is
the greatest eminency, and art of publication in the whole world; and
she in all her arts of secrecy and hiding her worthy things, was but <hi>like
one that hideth the wind, and covers the oyntment of her right hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not by what instrument it happened; but when death drew
neer, before it made any show upon her body, or revealed it self by a
natural signification, it was conveyed to her spirit: she had a strange secret
perswasion that the bringing this child should be her last scene of life:
and we have known, that the soul when she is about to disrobe her self
of her upper garment, sometimes speaks rarely, <hi>Magnifica verba mors
propè admota excutit;</hi> sometimes it is Prophetical; sometimes God by
a superinduced perswasion wrought by instruments, or accidents of his
own, serves the ends of his own providence and the salvation of the
soul: But so it was, that the thought of death dwelt long with her,
and grew from the first steps of fancy and fear, to a consent, from thence
to a strange credulity, and expectation of it; and without the violence
of sickness she dyed, as if she had done it voluntarily, and by design,
and for fear her expectation should have been deceived, or that she
should seem to have had an unreasonable fear, or apprehension; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(as one said of <hi>Cato) sic abiit è vitâ ut causam moriendi nactam se esse
gauderet,</hi> she dyed, as if she had been glad of the opportunity.</p>
                  <p>And in this I cannot but adore the providence, and admire the wisdom
and infinite mercies of God: For having a tender and soft, a delicate
and fine constitution and breeding, she was tender to pain, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
of it, as a childs shoulder is of a load and burden: <hi>Grave est te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerae
cervici jugum;</hi> and in her often discourses of death, which she
wonld renew willingly and frequently, she would tell, that she feared
not death, but she feared the sharp pains of death: <hi>Emori nolo, me esse
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56643:91"/>
mortuam non curo:</hi> The being dead, and being freed from the troubles
and dangers of this world, she hoped would be for her advantage, and
therefore that was no part of her fear: But she believing the pangs of
death were great, and the use and aids of reason little, had reason to fear
lost they should do violence to her spirit and the decency of her resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But God that knew her fears and her jealousie concerning her
self, fitted her with a death so easie, so harmless, so painless, that it did
not put her patience to a severe trial. It was not (in all appearance) of so
much trouble, as two fits of a common ague; so careful was God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
to all that stood in that sad attendance, that this soul was dear
to him: and that since she had done so much of her duty towards it,
he that began would also finish her redemption, by an act of a rare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and a singular mercy. <hi>Blessed be that goodness of God, who does
so careful actions of mercy for the ease and security of his servants.</hi> But
this one instance was a great demonstration that the apprehension of
death is worse than the pains of death; and that God loves to reprove
the unreasonableness of our fears, by the mightiness, and by the arts of
his mercy.</p>
                  <p>She had in her sickness (if I may so call it, or rather in the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and graver preparations towards death) some curious and well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
fears, concerning the final state of her soul: But from thence
she passed into a <hi>deliquium,</hi> or a kind of trance, and as soon as she came
forth of it, as if it had been a vision, or that she had conversed with an
Angel, and from his hand had received a labell or scroll of the <hi>Book of
Life,</hi> and there seen her name enrolled, she cryed out aloud, [<hi>Glory be
to God on high: Now I am sure I shall be saved.</hi>] Concerning which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of discoursing we are wholly ignorant what judgment can be made:
but certainly there are strange things in the other world; and so there
are in all the immediate preparations to it; and a little glimpse of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
a minutes conversing with an Angel, any ray of God, any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
extraordinary from the Spirit of comfort, which God gives to
his servants in strange and unknown manners, are infinitely far from il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions;
and they shall then be understood by us, when we feel them,
and when our new and strange needs shall be refreshed by such unusual
visitations.</p>
                  <p>But I must be forced to use summaries and arts of abbreviature in the
enumerating those things in which this rare Personage was dear to God
and to all her Relatives.</p>
                  <p>If we consider her Person, she was in the flower of her age, <hi>Jucun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
cum aetas florida ver ageret;</hi> of a temperate, plain and natural diet,
without curiosity or an intemperate palate; she spent less time in dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
than many servants; her recreations were little and seldom, her
prayers often, her reading much: she was of a most noble and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
soul; a great lover of honourable actions, and as great a despiser
of base things; hugely loving to oblige others, and very unwilling to
be in arrear to any upon the stock of courtesies and liberality; so free
in all acts of favour, that she would not stay to hear her self thanked,
as being unwilling that what good went from her to a needful or an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
person should ever return to her again: she was an excellent friend,
and hugely dear to very many, especially to the best and most discerning
persons; to all that conversed with her, and could understand her great
worth and sweetness: she was of an honourable, a nice, and tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
and of the pleasures of this world, which were laid before her
in heaps, she took a very small and inconsiderable share, as not loving
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56643:92"/>
to glut her self with vanity, or take her portion of good things here
below.</p>
                  <p>If we look on her as a Wife, she was chast and loving, fruitful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screet,
humble and pleasant, witty and complyant, rich and fair; and
wanted nothing to the making her a principal and precedent to the best
Wives of the World, but a long life, and a full age.</p>
                  <p>If we remember her as a Mother, she was kind and severe, careful and
prudent, very tender, and not at all fond, a greater Lover of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
Souls than of their Bodies, and one that would value them more
by the strict rules of honour and proper worth, than by their relation to
her self.</p>
                  <p>Her Servants found her prudent, and fit to govern, and yet open-hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and apt to reward; a just Exactor of their duty, and a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
of their diligence.</p>
                  <p>She was in her house a Comfort to her dearest Lord, a Guide to her
Children, a Rule to her Servants, an Example to all.</p>
                  <p>But as she related to God in the offices of Religion, she was even and
constant, silent and devout, prudent and material; she loved what she
now enjoys, and she feared what she never felt, and God did for her
what she never did expect: her fears went beyond all her evil; and yet
the good which she hath received was, and is, and ever shall be beyond
all her hopes.</p>
                  <p>She lived as we all should live, and she died as I fain would die—</p>
                  <l>Et cum supremos Lachesis perneverit annos,</l>
                  <l>Non aliter cineres mando jacere meos.</l>
                  <p>I pray God I may feel those mercies on my Death-bed that she felt, and
that I may feel the same effect of my repentance which she feels of the
many degrees of her innocence. Such was her death, that she did not
die too soon; and her life was so useful and excellent, that she could not
have lived too long. <hi>Nemo parum diu vixit qui virtutis perfectae perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto
functus est munere.</hi> And as now in the grave it shall not be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
concerning her, how long she lived, but how well; so to us who live
after her, to suffer a longer calamity, it may be some ease to our sorrows,
and some guide to our lives, and some securiry to our conditions, to
consider that God hath brought the piety of a young Lady to the early
rewards of a never ceasing and never dying Eternity of Glory: And
we also, if we live as she did, shall partake of the same glories; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
having the honour of a good Name, and a dear and honour'd Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
but the glories of these glories, the end of all excellent labours,
and all prudent counsels, and all holy Religion, even the salvation of
our Souls in that day when all the Saints, and among them this excellent
Woman, shall be shewn to all the World to have done more, and more
excellent things than we know of or can describe. <hi>Mors illos consecrat,
quorum exitum &amp; qui timent, laudant:</hi> Death consecrates and makes sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
that person whose excellency was such, that they that are not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
at the death, cannot dispraise the life; but they that mourn sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
think they can never commend sufficiently.</p>

                  <p>AS God in the Creation of the World first produced a mass
of matter, having nothing in it but an obediential capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and passivity; which God separating into classes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
gave to every part a congruity to their respective
forms, which in their distinct Orbs and Stations they did
receive in order, and then were made beauteous by separations and
a new Oeconomy; and out of these he appointed some for Servants, and
some for Government; and some to eat, and some to be eaten; some
above, and some below; some to be useful to all the rest, and all to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to the good of man, whom he made the Prince of the Creation,
and a Minister of the Divine glory: So God hath also done in the new
Creation; all the world was concluded under sin, it was a corrupt mass,
all mankind <hi>had corrupted themselves;</hi> but yet were capable of Divine
influences, and of a nobler form, producible in the new birth: here
then Gods Spirit moves upon the waters of a Divine Birth, and makes
a separation of part from part, of corruption from corruption; and first
chose some Families to whom he communicated the Divine influences and
the breath of a nobler life; <hi>Seth</hi> and <hi>Enoch, Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham, Job</hi> and
<hi>Bildad,</hi> and these were the special Repositories of the Divine Grace, and
Prophets of righteousness to glorifie God in themselves, and in their
Sermons unto others. But this was like enclosing of the Sun; he that
shuts him in, shuts him out; and God who was and is an infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
would not be circumscribed and limited to a narrow circle: good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is his Nature, and infinite is his Measure, and communication of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56643:94"/>
that goodness is the motion of that eternal being: God <hi>g.</hi> breaks forth
as out of a Cloud, and picks out a whole Nation; the Sons of <hi>Israel</hi>
became his Family, and that soon swell'd into a Nation, and that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
multiplied till it became too big for their Country, and by a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
dispersion went, and did much good, and gained some servants to
God out of other parts of mankind. But God was pleased to cast lots
once more, and was like the Sun already risen upon the earth, who
spreads his rays to all the corners of the habitable World, that all that
will open their eyes and draw their Curtains, may see and rejoice in his
light. Here God resolved to call all the World; he sent into the high
ways and hedges, to the corners of the Gentiles, and the high ways of the
Jews, all might come that would; for <hi>the sound of the Gospel went out
into all Lands:</hi> and God chose all that came, but all would not; and those
that did, he gathered into a fold, marked them with his own mark, sent
his Son to be <hi>the great Shepherd and Bishop of their Souls;</hi> and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>a peculiar People unto God, a little Flock, a new Election.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here is the first separation and singularity of the Gospel; all
that hear the voice of Christ's first call, all that profess themselves his
Disciples, all that take his signature, they and their Children are the
Church, an <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> called out from the rest of the World, the <hi>elect</hi>
and the <hi>chosen of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now these being thus chosen out, culled and picked from the evil Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
of the World, he separates them from others, to gather them
to himself; he separates them and sanctifies them to become holy; to
come out (not of the companies so much, as) from the evil manners of
the world: God chuses them unto holiness, they are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
put in the right order to eternal life.</p>
                  <p>All Christians are <hi>holy unto the Lord,</hi> and <hi>g.</hi> must not be unholy in their
conversation; for nothing that is unholy shall come neer to God: That's
the first great line of our duty: But God intends it further: All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
must not be only holy, but <hi>eminently holy.</hi> For <hi>John indeed baptized
with water,</hi> but that's but a dull and unactive Element, and moves by
no principle, but by being ponderous; Christ <hi>baptizes with the Holy
Ghost and with fire,</hi> and God hates lukewarmness; and when he choses
to him a peculiar People, he adds, they must be <hi>zealous of good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in this affair, there are many steps and great degrees of progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
1. All Gods People must be delivered from all sin; for as Christ
came wholly <hi>to destroy the works of the Devil,</hi> so he intends also to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
his Church as a pure Virgin unto Christ;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
scandal, without hypocrisie, <hi>without spot or wrinkle, or any such
thing:</hi>
For to be quit from sin, that is, from all affection to it, is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Christians life: <hi>denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,</hi> and
<hi>being cleansed from all filthiness of flesh and spirit,</hi> and <hi>having escaped
from all corruption that is in the world through lust;</hi> this is not so much
commanded as supposed: without this nothing can be done, nothing
can be hoped: this is but the foundation of the Christian, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be <hi>a habitation of God, a member of Christ, a temple of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit of God:</hi> the building follows.</p>
                  <p>2. All Christians must acquire all the graces of the holy Spirit of God;
S. <hi>Peter</hi> gives the Catalogue [<hi>Faith, and Vertue, and Knowledge, and
Temperance, and Patience, and Godliness, and Brotherly kindness, and
Charity</hi>]<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 5.</note> and that you may see what is the spirit of a Christian, what an
activity and brisk principle is required to the acquisition of these things;
the Apostle gives this percept, that for the acquiring these things, <hi>we should
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56643:94"/>
give <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, all diligence;</hi> no lazy worker is a good Christian, he
must be diligent; and <hi>not every diligence,</hi> nor <hi>every degree of good dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi>
but it must be <hi>all, omnem omniuo diligentiam,</hi> give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
                  <p>3. There is yet another degree to be added here too: It is not
enough for a Christian to be free from corruption, and to have these
graces; and <hi>g.</hi> to be diligent, very diligent to obtain them; but they <hi>must
be in us and abound,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 8.</note> N. B. they must be in us; these graces and this
righteousness must be inherent; it is not enough for us that Christ had
them for us; for it is true, if he had not had them, we should never
have received those or any thing else that is good: but he had them,
that we might have them, and follow his steps who knew no sin, and
fulfilled all righteousness. They <hi>must be in us,</hi> saith S. <hi>Peter;</hi> and not
only so, they must also abound in us, that's the end of Christ's death,
that's the fruit of his Spirit: they must be plentiful like a full Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
or like <hi>Euphrates</hi> in the time of ripe Fruits; they must swell over
the banks: for when they are but <hi>in gradu virtutis,</hi> in the lowest step
of sincerity, they may fall from the tree like unripe fruit, and be fit for
nothing but for Prodigals and Swine; they must be in their season and
period, great and excellent, and eminent; they must take up all our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
fill up all our time, spend all our powers, satisfie the will, and
be adequate to all the powers of our choice; that is, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> adds,
they must be so, that we <hi>make our calling and election sure;</hi> so as that we
shall never any more depart from God: well thus far you see how se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and sacred a thing it is to be a Christian.</p>
                  <p>4. But there are yet three steps more beyond this: God requires of
us perseverance; a thrusting all this forward, even unto the end: <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
peace and holiness no man shall see God,</hi> saith the Author to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews;
<hi>but that's not all,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

which peace, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, without which following of peace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;
that is, unless we endure all contradiction of sinners and objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
without following it close and home to the utmost issue, to the
end of all righteousness, tending even to comprehension, to consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and perfection, no man shall see God; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is good and
great, to dwell in holiness: but that's not enough, it must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> too,
we must still pursue it, and that unto the end: <hi>for he that endureth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the end shall be saved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. And what more? yes there is something yet: For besides this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
of duration, there must be <hi>intensio graduum:</hi> for <hi>nondum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendimus,
nondum perfecti sumus,</hi> we have not yet comprehended,
we are not yet made perfect; but that must be aimed at: <hi>Be ye perfect
as your heavenly Father is perfect;</hi> be <hi>ye meek as Christ is,</hi> be <hi>ye holy as
God is holy; pure as your Father in Heaven is pure;</hi> and who can be so?
no man can be so in degree; but so in kind, every man must desire, and
every man must contend to be, and <hi>g.</hi> it is possible, else it had never
been required.</p>
                  <p>6. And now after all this, one thing more is to be done: you must
be so for your selves, and you must be so for others: you must be so as
to please God, and you must be so to edifie your Brethren: <hi>Let your
light so shine before men, that they may glorifie your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
let it be so eminent and conspicuous, that all that see your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and all that come into your Congregations may be convinced,
and <hi>falling down and worshipping, may say of a truth the Spirit of the

Lord is in you.</hi> And <hi>g.</hi> our Blessed Saviour in his Sermon upon the
Mount, which is the summary of a Christians life, at the end of the
eight beatitudes, tells all his Followers and Disciples: <hi>ye are the salt
of the world, ye are the light of the world;</hi> and <hi>g.</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
or the Gospel is compared <hi>to a woman that hid in three measures of
meal,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Heathen Idolaters, <hi>her Leaven, till all was
leavened:</hi>
our Light must be so shining, our Conversation so exemplar as
to draw all the world after us; that they that will not, may be ashamed,
and they that wil, lmay be allured by the beauty of the flame. These
are the proportions and measures of every Christian, for <hi>from the days
of John the Baptist, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
take it by force;</hi> that although, <hi>John the Baptist was the greatest that
ever was born of woman,</hi> yet, he that <hi>is least in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi>
the meanest of the Laity, may be <hi>greater than he.</hi> This is a great
height, and these things I have premised, not only to describe the duty
of all that are here present, even of all Christians whatsoever, that
you may not depart without your portion of a blessing; but also as a
foundation of the ensuing periods, which I shall address to you my
Brethren of the Clergy, the Fathers of the people; for I speak in a
School of the Prophets, Prophets and Prophets Sons; to you who are
or intend to be so.</p>
                  <p>For God hath made a separation of you even beyond this separation:
he hath separated you yet again; he hath put you anew into the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soble,
he hath made you to pass through the fire seven times more.
For it is true, that the whole community of the People is the Church;
<hi>Ecclesia sancta est communio sanctorum,</hi> the holy Catholick Church is
the communion of Saints; but yet by the voice and consent of all
Christendom, you are the Church by way of propriety, and eminency,
and singularity [<hi>Church-men</hi>] that's your appellative: all are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>spiritual men,</hi> all have received the Spirit, and all walk in the
Spirit, and ye are all <hi>sealed by the Spirit unto the day of Redemption,</hi> and yet
there is a spirituality peculiar to the Clergy: <hi>If any man be overtaken in
a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note>
you who are spiritual by office and designation, of a spiritual calling, and
spiritual employment; you who have the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, and
minister the Spirit of God, you are more eminently spiritual; you have
the Spirit in graces and in powers, in sanctification and abilities, in Office
and in Person; the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from above</hi> hath descended upon your
heads and upon your hearts; you are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by way of eminency and
praelation, <hi>spiritual men.</hi> All <hi>the people of God were holy; Corah</hi> and his
company were in the right so far; but yet <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were more
holy, and stood neerer to God. All the people are Prophets: It is now
more than <hi>Moses</hi> wish, for the Spirit of Christ hath made them so: <hi>If
any man prayeth or prophesieth with his head covered;</hi> or <hi>if any woman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesieth
with her head uncovered,</hi> they are dishonoured; but either man or
woman may do that work in time and place; for <hi>in the latter days I will
pour out of my Spirit, and your daughters shall prophesie:</hi> and yet God hath
appointed in his Church Prophets above these, to whose Spirit all the
other Prophets are subject; and as God said to <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Moses, to you I am known in a dream or a vision, but to</hi> Moses <hi>I
speak face to face;</hi> so it is in the Church, God gives of his Spirit to all
men, but you he hath made the Ministers of his Spirit: Nay the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have their portion of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, so said
S. <hi>Paul; To whom ye forgive any thing, to him I forgive also;</hi> and to the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56643:95"/>
whole Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> he gave a Commission <hi>in the Name of Christ,
and by his Spirit to deliver the incestuous person unto Satan;</hi> and when
the primitive Penitents stood in their penitential stations, they did <hi>Chairs
Dei adgeniculari, &amp; toti populo legationem orationis suae commendare;</hi> and
yet the Keys were not only promised, but given to the Apostles to be
used then, and transmitted to all Generations of the Church; and we
are <hi>Ministers of Christ, and Stewards of the manifold Mysteries of God;
and to us is committed the word of reconciliation.</hi> And thus in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
of the mysterious Sacrament, the people have their portion;
for the Bishop or the Priest blesses, and the People by saying <hi>Amen</hi> to the
mystick Prayer is partaker of the Power, and the whole Church hath
a share in the power of Spiritual Sacrifice; <hi>Ye are a royal Priesthood,
Kings and Priests unto God;</hi> that is, so ye are Priests as ye are Kings; but
yet Kings and Priests have a glory conveyed to them, of which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
partake but in minority, and allegory, and improper communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But you are, and are to be respectively that considerable part of
mankind by whom God intends to plant holiness in the World; by you
God means to reign in the hearts of men; and <hi>g.</hi> you are to be the first
in this kind, and consequently the measure of all the rest: To you <hi>g.</hi> I
intend this, and some following Discourses in order to this purpose: I
shall but now lay the first stone, but it is the corner stone in this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But to you, I say, of the Clergy, these things are spoken properly; to
you these Powers are conveyed really; upon you God hath poured his
Spirit plentifully; you are the Choicest of his Choice, the Elect of his
Election, a Church pick'd out of the Church, Vessels of honour so
your Masters use, appointed to teach others, authorised to bless in his
Name; you are the Ministers of Christ's Priesthood, Under-labourers
in the great Work of Mediation and Intercession, <hi>Medii inter Deum &amp;
Populum;</hi> you are for the People towards God, and convey Answers and
Messages from God to the People: These things I speak, not only to
magnifie your Office, but to inforce and heighten your Duty; you are
holy by Office and Designation; for your very Appointment is a Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and a Consecration, and <hi>g.</hi> whatever holiness God requires of the
People, who have some little portions in the Priesthood Evangelical, he
expects it of you, and much greater, to whom he hath conveyed so great
Honours, and admitted so neer unto himself, and hath made to be the
great Ministers of his Kingdom and his Spirit: and now as <hi>Moses</hi> said to
the Levitical Schismaticks, <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company, so I may say to you,
<hi>Seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the God of Israel hath separated
you from the Congregation of Israel to bring you to himself,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 16. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>to do the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the Congregation to
minister to them? And he hath brought thee neer to him.</hi> Certainly if of
every one of the Christian Congregation God expects a holiness that
mingles with no unclean thing; if God will not suffer of them a luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm
and an indifferent service, but requires zeal of his Glory, and that
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the labour of love; if he will have
them to be without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; if he will not
endure any pollution in their Flesh or Spirit; if he requires that their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and Souls, and Spirits be kept blameless unto the coming of the Lord
Jesus; if he accepts of none of the people, unless they have within them
the conjugation of all Christian Graces; if he calls on them to abound
in every Grace, and that in all the periods of their progression, unto the
ends of their lives, and to the consummation and perfection of Grace;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56643:96"/>
if he hath made them Lights in the World, and the Salt of the Earth, to
enlighten others by their good Example, and to teach them and invite
them by holy Discourses, and wise Counsels, and Speech seasoned with
Salt; what is it think ye, or with what words is it possible to express
what God requires of you? They are to be Examples of Good life to
one another; but you are to be Examples even of the Examples them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
that's your duty, that's the purpose of God, and that's the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of my Text, <hi>That in all things ye shew your selves a pattern of good
works; in Doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech
that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
having no evil thing to say of you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here then is, 1. Your Duty. 2. The degrees and excellency of
your Duty.</p>
                  <p>The Duty is double: 1. Holiness of Life. 2. Integrity of Doctrine.
Both these have their heightnings in several degrees.</p>
                  <p>1. For your Life and Conversation, it ought not only to be good, not
only to be holy, but to be so up to the degrees of an excellent example;
<hi>Ye must be a pattern.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Ye must be patterns, not only of Knowledg and Wisdom, not of
contemplation and skill in Mysteries, not of unprofitable Notions, and
ineffective Wit and Eloquence; but of something that is more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
of something that may do good, something by which mankind shall
be better; of something that shall contribute to the felicity and comfort
of the world; <hi>a pattern of good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. It must not be a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a type or pattern to be hidden or laid in
Tabernacles, like those Images of <hi>Molech</hi> and <hi>Remphan,</hi> which the Spirit
of God in the Old Testament calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Succoth Benoth,</hi> little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positories
or Boots to hide their Images and patterns of their gods; but
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, you must be exhibited and shewn forth, brought forth
into action and visibility, and notorious observation.</p>
                  <p>4. There is also another mystery and duty in this word; for <hi>Molech</hi>
and <hi>Remphan</hi> they were patterns and figures, but they were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
patterns which <hi>the people made;</hi> but to <hi>Titus</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> commanded
that he himself should be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he should give a pattern to the
people; that is, the Ministers of Christ must not be framed according
to the peoples humour, they must not give him rules, nor describe his
measures; but he should be a rule to them; he is neither to live with
them so as to please their humours, or to preach Doctrines <hi>populo ut pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerent
quas fecissent fabulas:</hi> but the people are to require the Doctrine
at his mouth, and he is to become exemplar to them according to the
pattern seen in the Mount, according to the Laws of the Religion and the
example of Christ.</p>
                  <p>5. It must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; he must be a pattern in all things: It is not
enough that the Minister be a loving person, a good neighbourly man,
that he be hospitable, that he be not litigious, that he be harmless, and
that he be diligent; but in every Grace he must <hi>praeferre facem,</hi> hold a
torch, and shew himself a light in all the Commands of God. These are
the measures of his Holiness, the pattern in his Life and Conversation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Integrity of Doctrine. The matter of the Doctrine you
are to preach hath in it four qualifications.</p>
                  <p>1. It must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>incorrupt;</hi> that is, it must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
it must be according to the analogy of Faith, no Heretical mixtures, pure
Truths of God.</p>
                  <p>2. It must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, grave, and clean, and chast; that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:56643:96"/>
no vain and empty notions, little contentions, and pitiful disputes;
but becoming the wisdom of the Guide of Souls, and the Ministers of
Christ.</p>
                  <p>And 3. It must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>sound speech,</hi> so we read it; the word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
signifies <hi>salutary</hi> and <hi>wholesome;</hi> that is, such as is apt for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; for the building men up in a most holy
faith, and a more excellent charity; not feeding the people with husks
and droffe, with Colocynths and Gourds, with gay Tulips and useless
Daffodils, but with the bread of life, and medicinal Plants springing
from the margin of the Fountains of Salvation. This is the matter of
their Doctrine; and this also hath some heightnings, and excellencies,
and extraordinaries: For,</p>
                  <p>4. It must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, so evidently demonstrated, that no man
shall be able to reprove it; so certainly holy, that no man shall be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to condemn it.</p>
                  <p>And 5. It must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> sincere, not polluted with foul inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and little devices of secular interests, complying with the lusts
of the potent, or the humours of the time; not byass'd by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,
or bending in the flexures of humane policy: it must be so
conducted that your very Enemies, Schismaticks and Hereticks, and
all sorts of gainsayers, may see that you intend Gods glory, and the
good of Souls; and <hi>g.</hi> that as they can say nothing against the Doctrine
deliver'd; so neither shall they find fault with him that delivers it:
and he that observes all this, will indeed be a pattern both of Life and
Doctrine; both of good words, and good works.</p>
                  <p>But I shall not be so minute in my discourse, as in the division: the
duties and the manner or degrees of the duties I shall handle together,
and give you the best measures I can both for institution of Life and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of Doctrine. <hi>It is required of every one of you, that in all
things you shew your selves a pattern of good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's the first thing requir'd in a Minister: And this is upon infinite
accounts necessary; 1. In general. 2. In particular. 1. In general.
The very first words of the whole Psalter are an argument of this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity:
<hi>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the Councel of the ungodly,
nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the chair of the mockers,</hi>
the seat of the scornful. The Doctors Chair or Pulpit must have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with the <hi>irrisores,</hi> that mock God, and mock the people;
he must neither walk with them, nor stand with them, nor sit with
them; that is, he must <hi>have no fellowship with the unfruitful workers of
darkness, but rather reprove them;</hi> for they that do preach one thing and
do another are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Mockers; they destroy the benefit of the people,
and diminish the blessings of God; and <hi>binding burdens on the peoples
shoulders which they will not touch with the top of their finger,</hi> they secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laugh and mock at the people, as at the Asses of <hi>Issachar</hi> fit to be
cousened into unnecessary burdens. These words are greatly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded:
The Primitive Church would admit no man to the superiour
Orders of the Clergy, unless among other praerequir'd dispositions, they
could say all <hi>Davids</hi> Psalter by heart; and it was very well, besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other reasons, that they might in the front read their own duty, so
wisely and so mysteriously by the Spirit of God made praeliminary to
the whole Office.</p>
                  <p>To the same purpose is that observation of S. <hi>Hierome</hi> made concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the vesting of the Priests in the Levitical ministrations; the Priest
put on the Humeral, beset with precious stones, before he took

the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or the <hi>rationale</hi> upon his breast, to signifie that first the Priest
must be a shining light, resplendent with good works, before he fed
them with the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the rational Milk of the Word: concerning
which symbolical precept you may please to read many excellent things
to this purpose in S. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s Epistle to <hi>Fabiola.</hi> It will be more useful
for us to consider those severe words of <hi>David</hi> in the 50. <hi>Psalm;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 16, 17.</note> 
                     <hi>But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the wicked, God saith, what hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that
thou shouldst take my Covenant in thy mouth: seeing thou hatest instruction
and castest my words behind thee?</hi> The words are a sad upbraiding to all
ungodly Ministers, and they need no Commentary; for whatever their
Office and Employment be to teach Gods people, yet unless they regard
the Commandments of God in their heart and practice themselves, they
having nothing to do with the Word of God, they sin in taking the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
a Testament of God into their mouth. God said to the sinner,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Raschaah,</hi> that is, <hi>to him that had sinned and had not repented of his
sins;</hi> so the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase reads it; <hi>Impio a qui non agit poenitentiam
&amp; orat in praevaricatione dixit Deus.</hi> Indeed if none could be admitted
to this Ministry but those who had never sinn'd, the Harvest might be
very great, but the Labourers would be extremely few, or rather none
at all; but after repentance they must be admitted, and not before; <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitas opilabit os eorum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 107. 42.</note> iniquity shall stop their mouths, saith <hi>David;</hi>
that ought to silence them indeed: And this was <hi>David</hi>'s care when he
had fallen into the foul crimes of Murder and Adultery; he knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unfit and unable, though he were a Prophet, to teach others the
Laws of God; but when he prayed to God to restore him to a free Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 13.</note>
he addes; <hi>Then will I teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be
converted unto thee:</hi> till then it was to no purpose for him to Preach.
<hi>But thou when thou art converted,</hi> said Christ to <hi>Peter, strengthen the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
The Primitive Church had a degree of severity beyond this, for
they would not admit any man who had done publick Penance to receive
holy Orders: To which purpose they were excellent words which
P. <hi>Hormisda</hi> spake in his Letters to the Bishops of <hi>Spain,</hi> in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
them to the observation of the ancient Canons of the Church, telling
them that, <hi rend="margQuotes">They who are promoted to the Clergy ought to be better
than others; <hi>nam longâ debet vitam suam probatione monstrare, cui guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacula
committuntur Ecclesiae [non negamus, &amp;c.</hi> we deny not but amongst
the Laity there are many whose manners are pleasing to God, but the
faithful Laws of God seek for him Souldiers that are approved, and they
ought rather to afford to others by themselves an example of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life, than require it from them] <hi>ideoque nullus ex poenitentibus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
ordinari, quisnam quem paulo antè jacentem viderat, veneretur Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistitem?</hi>
None of the publick Penitents must be ordained, for who
will esteem that Priest venerable, whom a little before he saw disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by scandalous and publick Crimes?</hi> But this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of them only,<note place="margin">Amos 5. 10.</note> as the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> expresses it, <hi>qui corripiuntur
in portâ,</hi> who are rebuked in the gate, condemned by publick sentence,
and are blotted with the Reproaches of the Law. But in all cases,
<q>Turpe est Doctori cum culpa redarguit ipsum.</q>
The guilt of the sin which a man reproves, quite spoils his Sermon:
<hi>ipsam obmutescere facundiam, si aegra sit conscientia,</hi> said S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> a sick
conscience spoils the tongue of the Eloquent, and makes it stammer.
For how shall any man preach against sin, or affright his people from
their dangers, if he denies Gods justice? and if he thinks God is just,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56643:97"/>
why is not he confounded that with his own mouth pronounces damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against himself? Nothing confounds a man so much, as to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of his own mouth: <hi>Esse munda studeat manus quae diluere sordes
curat,</hi> said S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> the hand that means to make another clean, should
not it self be dirty. But all this is but in general; there are yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
more particular and material.</p>
                  <p>1. A Minister of an evil life cannot do so much good to his charges,
he cannot profit them, he is not useful <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he pulls down as fast,
or faster than he builds up: <hi>Thalmud absque opere, non est magnum Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi>
said the Jews Proverb; a good Sermon without a good example,
is no very good Sermon. For besides that such a man is contemptible
to his people; contemptible, not only naturally, but by Divine Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(according to that of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>propter quod dedi vos contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptibiles
omni populo;</hi> for this very reason I have made you to be scorned
in the eyes of all the people) but besides this, it is very considerable what
<hi>S. Chrysostom</hi> says; <hi>si praedicas &amp; non facis, opus proponis tanquam impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibile;</hi>
he that preaches mortification and lives voluptuously, propounds
the duty as if it were impossible: for certainly if it be good, and if it
be possible, a man will ask, why is it not done? it is easie for him that
is well to give a sick man counsel; <hi>verùm tu si hic esses, certè aliter sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires,</hi>
when it comes to be his own case, when the sickness pinches, and
when the belly calls for meat, where's the fine oration then? <hi>omnia
quae vindicâris in alio,</hi>

                     <hi>tibi ipsi vehementer fugienda sunt: etenim non mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
accusator, sed ne objurgator ferendus est qui, quod in alio vitium repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendit,
in eo ipso deprehenditur;</hi> whatsoever you reprove in others must be
infinitely avoided by your self; for no man will endure an <hi>Accuser,</hi> no
nor so much as a man <hi>to chide</hi> for that fault in which himself was taken.
But if your charges see you bear your sickness patiently, and your Cross
nobly, and despise money generously, and forgive your Enemy brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and relieve the poor charitably; then he sees your Doctrine is tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
and material, it is more then words, and he loves you, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
what you say. In the East the Shepherds used to go before their
sheep, to which our Blessed Saviour alludes, <hi>my sheep hear my voice and
follow me;</hi> but our Shepherds are forced to drive them, and affright
them with dogs and noises; it were better if themselves did go before.
3. A Minister of an evil life cannot preach with that fervour and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
with that life &amp; spirit as a good man does; for besides that he does
not himself understand the secrets of Religion, and the private induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Spirit, and the sweetness of internal joy, and the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
advantages of a holy peace; besides this, he cannot heartily
speak all that he knows; he hath a clog at his foot, and a gag in his teeth,
there is a fear and there is a shame, and there is a guilt and a secret wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
that the thing were not true; and some little private arts to
lessen his own consent, and to take off the asperities and consequent trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of a clear conviction. To which if we add, that there is a secret en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
in all wicked men against the prosperities of goodness; and if I should
say no more, this alone were enough to silence a <hi>Boanerges,</hi> and to make
his Thunder still and easie as an Oaten pipe: <hi>nonne id flagitium est, te aliis
consilium dare, foris sapere, tibi non posse auxiliari?</hi> That's a burning shame
and an intolerable wickedness, that a Minister shall be like <hi>Marcotis,</hi> or
the Statue of <hi>Mercury,</hi> shew the way to others, and himself stand still
like a painted block; to be wise abroad, and a very fool in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
and unable to do himself good. <hi>Dicit Reslakis, ornate ipsum, posteae
ornato alios;</hi> first trim thy self, and then adorn thy Brother, said the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56643:98"/>
Rabbins: but certain it is, he that cannot love to see others better than
himself,<note place="margin">Juvenal.</note> it cannot be that he should heartily endeavour it.

                     </gap>, this is but the least evil,
there is yet much worse behind: A wicked Minister cannot with success
and benefit pray for the people of his Charges; and this is a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for Prayer is the Key of <hi>David;</hi> and God values it at so high a rate,
that Christ is made the Prince of all Intercession, and God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Angels to convey to his Throne of Grace the Prayers of the Saints; and
he hath made Prophets and Priests, even the whole Clergy, the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Ministers of Prayer;<note place="margin">Numb. 15. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Orabit pro eo Sacerdos,</hi> the Priest shall pray for
him,<note place="margin">Lev. 4. 35.</note> the Priest shall make an attonement for his sin, and it shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
him. And Gods anger is no where more fiercely described, than
when things come to that pass, that he will not hear the Priest or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
praying for the people; <hi>g. pray not thou for this people,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 7. 16. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>neither lift
up Prayer nor cry for them, neither make intercession to me; for behold mine
anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place:</hi> when the Prayers
of the gracious and acceptable persons, the presidents of prayer are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
then things are desperate; it is a greater Excommunication:
the man sins a sin unto death; and I say not that thou pray for him that
sins unto death. This I say is the Priests Office, and if the people lose
the benefit of this they are undone: to Bishop <hi>Timothy, S. Paul</hi> gave it
in charge, <hi>That Supplications, and Prayers, and Intercessions be made for
all men;</hi> and <hi>S. James</hi> advised <hi>the sick to send for the Elders of the Church</hi>
(the Bishops and Priests) <hi>and let them pray over them;</hi> and then, <hi>their
sins shall be forgiven them:</hi> but how? that is supposed, the Minister
prays fervently, and be a righteous man; for <hi>the effectual fervent Prayer
of a righteous man availeth much,</hi> it is promised on no other terms: <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
vir talis oratio,</hi> is an old rule; as is the man, such is his Prayer. <hi>The
Prayer of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,</hi> said <hi>Solomon;</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prevail for himself, much less for others. I remember that <hi>Bias</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once in a storm, and a company of Villains in the Ship being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted,
called upon their Gods for help: <hi>Cavete</hi> (said he) <hi>ne vos Dii
interesse sentiunt,</hi> take heed lest the Gods perceive you to be here, lest
we all perish for your sakes; and upon surer grounds it was that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
said, <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my Prayer.</hi>
And what then do you think will be the event of those Assemblies,
where he that presents the prayers of all the people is hateful to God?
Will God receive the oblation that is presented to him by an impure
hand?<note place="margin">Exod. 30. 40.</note> The Levitical Priests were commanded to wash before they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed;
and every man is commanded to repent before he prays; <hi>My
Son hast thou sinned, do so no more,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ecclus.</note> [and then] <hi>ask pardon for thy former
fault;</hi> and can we hope that the Minister, who <hi>with wrath and doubting,</hi>
and covetousness presents the peoples prayers, that ever those interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
shall pierce the clouds and ascend to the Mercy-Seat, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
with a blessing? Believe it not; a man that is ungracious in his
life, can never be gracious in his Office, and acceptable to God: we are
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56643:98"/>
abundantly taught this by those excellent words of God by the Prophet
<hi>Micah; The Heads of Sion judge for reward, and the Priests thereof teach
for hire, and the Prophets thereof divine for money; yet will they lean up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lord, and say, is not the Lord among us?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Micah. 3. 11.</note> As if God had said, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is so presumptuous and unreasonable as to lean upon God, and
think he will be among us when the Priests and the Prophets are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
and wicked: No, he declares it expresly, <hi>v. 7. Then shall the Seers
be ashamed, and the Divines confounded, yea they shall all cover their lips;
for there is no answer of God;</hi> God will not answer: For sometimes the
case is so, that <hi>though Noah, Daniel, and Job were there,</hi> God would not
hear; that is, when the people are incorrigibly wicked, and the decree
is irrevocably gone out for judgment: But there are other times in which
the prayers of innocent people being presented by an ungracious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and Intercessor, are very much hindred in prevailing. In such cases,
God is put to Extraordinaries, and Christ and Christs Angels are then
the suppletories, and at the best, the peoples prayers go alone, they
want the assistance of the <hi>Angel of the Church,</hi> and they get no help or
furtherance from him, and probably very much hindrance: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that of S. <hi>Greg. Cum is qui displicet ad intercedendum mittitur, ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti
animus ad deteriora provocatur: Alexander</hi> hated to see <hi>Zercon,</hi> and
<hi>g.</hi> if he had interceded for <hi>Clytus,</hi> it would but have hastened his death:
a mans suit thrives the worse for having a hated Intercessor. If <hi>g.</hi> he that
robs a Church of a Patin, or a Chalice, be a sacrilegious person, what is
he that steals from the Church of God (so far as lies in him) the fruit of
all their holy Prayers; that corrupts the Sacrifice, and puts <hi>Colliquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida</hi>
into the Cups of Salvation, and mingles death in the pottage provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the Children and Disciples of the Prophets? I can say no more,
but to expostulate with them in those upbraiding words of God in the
Prophet; <hi>Do they provoke me to anger saith the Lord? do they not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
themselves to the confusion of their own faces? Confundentur Divini,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 7. 19.</note>
                     <hi>&amp; operient vultus suos omnes;</hi> all such Divines shall be confounded,<note place="margin">Mich. 3. 7.</note> and
shall cover their faces in the day of sad accounts. <hi>Divini sunt non Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logi,</hi>
they are <hi>Diviners</hi> and not <hi>Divines;</hi> Witches rather than Prophets:
they are the Sons of <hi>Bosor,</hi> and have no Portion in the Oeconomy of
God: In short, if so much holiness as I formerly described, be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of him that is appointed to preach to others, to offer spiritual sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
for the People, to bless the People, to divert Judgments from them,
to deprecate the wrath of God, to make an attonement for them, and
to reconcile them to the eternal mercy; certain it is, that though the
Sermons of a wicked Minister may do some good, not so much as they
ought, but some they can: but the Prayer of a wicked Minister does no
good at all; it provokes God to anger, it is an abomination in his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
eyes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Ecclesiastical Order is by Christ appointed to minister
his holy Spirit to the People; The Priests in Baptism, and the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
and Prayer, and Intercession; The Bishop in all these, and in
Ordination besides, and in Confirmation, and in Solemn Blessing: Now
then consider what will be the event of this without effect: Can he
minister the Spirit from whom the Spirit of God is departed? And
<hi>g.</hi> since all wickedness does <hi>grieve the Spirit of God,</hi> and great wickedness
defiles his Temples, and destroys them unto the ground, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
the Spirit that drives iniquity away; these persons are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
spiritual men; <hi>they are carnal, and sold under sin,</hi> and walk not in
the Spirit; they are spiritual just as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was a Christian, or as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56643:99"/>
                     <hi>Judas</hi> was an Apostle; he had the name of it; but what says the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
<hi>he fell from it by transgression;</hi> only this, as he that is Baptized
has for ever a title to the Promises, and a possibility of Repentance, and
a right to Restitution, until he renounces all, and never will or can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
so there is in all our holy Orders an indelible character, and they
can by a new life be restored to all their powers; but in the mean
time while they abide in sin and carnality, the cloud is over the face of
the Sun, and the Spirit of God appears not in a fiery tongue, that is
not in material and active demonstrations; and how far he will be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
by the Offices of an unworthy man, we know not, only by all
that is said in Scripture we are made to fear, that things will not be so well
with the people, till the Minister be better; only this we are sure of, that
though one man may be much the worse for another mans sin, yet without
his own fault no man shall perish; and God will do his work alone;
and the Spirit of God, though he be ordinarily conveyed by Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Ministries, yet he also comes irregularly, and in ways of his own,
and prevents the external Rites, and prepossesses the hearts of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
and the people also have so much portion in the Evangelical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration,
that if they be holy, they shall receive the holy Ghost in their
hearts, and will express him in their lives, and themselves also become
Kings and Priests unto God, while they are zealous of good works. And
to this purpose may the proverb of the Rabbins be rightly understood,
<hi>Major est qui respondit Amen, quam qui benedicit;</hi> He that sayes <hi>Amen</hi> is
greater than he that blesses or prays; meaning, if he heartily desires
what the other perfunctorily and with his lips only utters, not praying
with his heart, and with the acceptabilities of a good life, the <hi>Amen</hi>
shall be more than all the Prayer, and the People shall prevail for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
when the Priest could not; according to the saying of <hi>Midrasich
Tehillim,</hi> 
                     <q>Quicunque dicit <hi>Amen</hi> omnibus viribus suis, ei aperiuntur portae
paradisi, sicut dictum est, &amp; ingredietur gens justa;</q> 
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">He that says <hi>Amen</hi>
with his whole power, to him the gates of Paradise shall be open, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that which is said, And the righteous Nation shall enter in.</hi>]
And this is excellently discoursed of by S. <hi>Austin, Sacramentum gratiae
dat etiam Deus per malos, ipsam vero gratim non nisi per seipsum, vel per
sanctos suos;</hi> and <hi>g.</hi> he gives remission of sins by himself, or by the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Dove;</hi> so that good Men shall be supplied by God. But as
this is an infinite comfort to the people, so it is an intolerable shame to
all wicked Ministers; the benefit which God intended to minister by
them, the people shall have without their help, and whether they will
or no; but because the people get nothing by their ministration, or but
very little, the Ministers shall never have their portion where the good
people shall inhabit to eternal Ages: And I beseech you to consider what
an infinite confusion that will be at the day of Judgment, when they to
whom you have preach'd Righteousness shall enter into everlasting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and you who have preached it shall have the curse of <hi>Hanameel,</hi> and
the reward of <hi>Balaam; the wages of unrighteousness.</hi> But thus it was when
the Wise men asked the Doctors where Christ should be born, they told
them right; but the Wise men went to Christ and found him, and the
Doctors sate still and went not.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Consider, That every sin which is committed by a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Religion is more than one, and it is as soon espied too; for more
men look upon the Sun in an Eclipse than when he is in his beauty: but
every spot I say is greater, every mote is a beam; it is not only made so,
but it is so; it hath not the excuses of the people, is not pitiable by
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56643:99"/>
the measures of their infirmity: and <hi>g.</hi> 1. It is reckoned in the accounts
of malice, never of ignorance: for ignorance it self in them is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a double sin; and <hi>g.</hi> it is very remarkable, that when God gave
command to the Levitical Priests to make attonement for the sins of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
in the people,<note place="margin">Levit 4.</note> there is no mention made of the Priests sin of
ignorance; God supposed no such thing in them, and <hi>Moses</hi> did not
mention it,<note place="margin">Numb. 15. Vide Origen homil. 2. in Levit.</note> and there was no provision made in that case, as you may
see at large in <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. But 2. because every Priest is a
man also, observe how his sin is described, <hi>Levit. 4. 3. If the Priest that is
anointed do sin according to the sin of the People;</hi> that is, if he be so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
and descend from the glory where God hath placed him, and
do sin after the manner of the people, then he is to proceed to remedy:
intimating that it is infinitely besides expectation; it is a strange thing,
it is like a monstrous production, it is unnatural that a Priest should sin
according as the People do; however, if he does, it is not connived
at which a sentence gentle, as that finds which is a sin of ignorance, or the
sin of the people: no, it is not; for it is always malice, it is always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness,
for it brings mischief to their Congregations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
their blessings into little circuits, and turns their bread into a
stone, and their Wine to Vinegar: And then besides this, 3. It is also
scandalous, and then it is infinitely against Charity; such Ministers
make the people of God to sin, and that's against the nature of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and design of their persons: God sent them to bring the people
from sin, and not to be like so many <hi>Jeroboams,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Nebat,</hi> to
set forward the Devils Kingdom, to make the people to transgress the
Covenant of their God: For they who live more by example than by
precept, will more easily follow the works of their Minister than the
words of God; and few men will aspire to be more righteous than their
guide; they think it well if they be as he is: and hence it is no wonder
that we see iniquity so popular. <hi>Oppida tota canem venerantur, nemo Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam;</hi>
every man runs after his lusts and after his money, because they
see too many of the Clergy little looking after the ways of godliness.
But then consider, let all such persons consider,</p>
                  <p>5. That the accounts which an ungodly and an irreligious Minister
of Religion shall make, must needs be intolerable; when besides the
damnation which shall certainly be inflicted upon them for the sins of
their own lives, they shall also reckon for all the dishonours they do to
God, and to Religion, and for all the sins of the people, which they did
not in all just ways endeavour to hinder, and all the sins which their
Flocks have committed by their evil example and undisciplin'd lives.</p>
                  <p>6. I have but two words more to say in this affair: 1. Every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
that lives an evil life, is that person whom our Blessed Saviour means
under the odious appellative of a <hi>Hireling:</hi> For he is not the hireling
that receives wages, or that lives of the Altar; <hi>sine farinâ non est lex,</hi>
said the DD. of the Jews; <hi>without bread-corn no man can preach the
Law;</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> though he spared the Corinthians, yet he took wages
of other Churches, of all, but in the Regions of <hi>Achaia;</hi> and the Law
of Nature and the Law of the Gospel have taken care, that <hi>he that
serves at the Altar should live of the Altar,</hi> and he is no hireling for all
that; but he is a hireling that does not do his duty; he that <hi>flies when
the Wolf comes,</hi> says Christ, he that is not present with them in dangers,
that helps them not to resist the Devil, to master their temptations, to
invite them on to piety, to gain souls to Christ; to him it may be said
as the Apostle did of the <hi>Gnosticks, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Gain to them is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:56643:100"/>
and Theology is but <hi>artificium venale,</hi> a trade of life, to fill the
belly and keep the body warm. <hi>An cuiquam licere putas, quod cuivis
non licet?</hi> Is any thing lawful for thee that is not lawful for every man;
and if thou dost not mind in thy own case whether it be lawful or no,
then thou dost but sell Sermons, and give Counsel at a price, and like a
flye in the Temple, taste of every Sacrifice, but do nothing but trouble
the religious Rites: for certain it is, no man takes on him this Office,
but he <hi>either seeks those things which are his own,</hi> or <hi>those things which
are Jesus Christs;</hi> and if he does this, <hi>he is a Minister of Jesus Christ;</hi> if he
does the other, he is <hi>the hireling,</hi> and intends nothing but his belly, and
<hi>God shall destroy both it and him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Lastly: <hi>These things I have said unto you that ye sin not;</hi> but this is
not the great thing here intended; you may be innocent and yet not
<hi>zealous of good works;</hi> but if you be not this, you are not <hi>Good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Jesus Christ:</hi> But that this is infinitely your duty, and indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
incumbent on you all, besides the express words of my Text, and all
the precepts of Christ and his Apostles, we have the concurrent sence of
the whole Church, the Laws and expectations of all the world, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Clergy a great and an examplar sanctity: for <hi>g.</hi> it is, that
upon this necessity is founded the Doctrine of all Divines in their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of the states and orders of Religion; of which you may large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inform your selves in <hi>Gerson's</hi> Treatise <hi>De perfectione Religionis, in
Aquinas 22. q.</hi> 184. and in all his Scholars upon that Question; the sum
of which is this, That all those institutions of Religions, which S. <hi>Anselm</hi>
calls <hi>factitias Religiones,</hi> that is, the Schools of Discipline in which men
forsaking the world give themselves up wholly to a pious life, they are
indeed very excellent if rightly performed; they are <hi>status perfectionis
acquirendae,</hi> they are excellent institutions for the acquiring perfection;
but the state of the superior Clergy is <hi>status perfectionis exercendae,</hi> they
are states which suppose perfection to be already in great measures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and then to be exercised, not only in their own lives, but in the
whole Oeconomy of their Office: and <hi>g.</hi> as none are to be chosen but
those who have given themselves up to the strictness of a holy life (so
far as can be known;) so none do their duty, so much as tolerably, but
those who by an exemplar sanctity become patterns to their Flocks of
all good works. <hi>Herod's</hi> Doves could never have invited so many stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to their Dove-cotes, if they had not been besmeared with <hi>Opobalsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum:</hi>
But <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, said <hi>Didymus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Geoponic. l. 14.</note>
make your Pigeons smell sweet and they will allure whole Flocks; and
if your life be excellent, if your virtues be like a precious oyntment,
you will soon invite your Charges to run <hi>in odorem unguentorum,</hi> after
your precious odours: But you must be excellent, not <hi>tanquam unus de
populo,</hi> but <hi>tanquam homo Dei,</hi> you must be a man of God, not after the
common manner of men, but <hi>after Gods own heart;</hi> and men will strive
to be like you, if you be like to God: but when you only stand at the
door of virtue, for nothing but to keep sin out, you will draw into
the folds of Christ none but such as fear drives in. <hi>Ad majorem Dei glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi>
to do what will most glorifie God, that's the line you must walk
by: for to do no more than all men needs must, is servility, not so
much as the affection of <hi>Sons;</hi> much less can you be <hi>Fathers</hi> to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when you go not so far as the Sons of God: for a dark Lanthorn,
though there be a weak brightness on one side, will scarce inlighten one,
much less will it conduct a multitude, or allure many followers by the
brightness of its flame. And indeed the Duty appears in this, that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56643:100"/>
many things are lawful for the people which are scandalous in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
you are tied to more abstinences, to more severities, to more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations
and self-denials, you may not with that freedom receive se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
contentments that others may; you must spend more time in
Prayers, your Alms must be more bountiful, your hands more open,
your hearts enlarged; others must relieve the poor, you must take care
of them; others must shew themselves their brethren, but you must be
their Fathers: they must pray frequently and fervently, but you must
give your <hi>selves up wholly to the Word of God and Prayer;</hi> they must <hi>watch
and pray that they fall not into temptation,</hi> but you must watch for your
selves and others too; the people must mourn when they sin, but you must
mourn for your own infirmities, and for the sins of others; and indeed,
if the life of a Clergy-man does not exceed even the piety of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that life is in some measure scandalous: and what shame was ever
greater than is described in the Parable of the Traveller going from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
to <hi>Jericho,</hi> when to the eternal dishonour of the Levite and the
Priest, it is told that they went aside, and saw him with a wry neck and a
bended head, but let him alone and left him to be cured by the good
Samaritane? The Primitive Church in her Discipline used to thrust
their delinquent Clergy <hi>in laicam communionem,</hi> even then when their
faults were but small, and of less reproach than to deserve greater cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
yet they lessened them by thrusting them into the Lay Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
as most fit for such Ministers who refused to live at the height of
Sacerdotal piety. Remember your dignity to which Christ hath called
you: <hi>shall such a man as I flee,</hi> said the brave <hi>Eleazar?</hi> shall the Stars be
darkness, shall the Embassadors of Christ neglect to do their King ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
shall the glory of Christ do dishonourable and inglorious actions?
<hi>Ye are the glory of Christ,</hi> saith <hi>S. Paul;</hi> remember that, I can say no
greater thing; unless possibly this may add some moments for your care
and caution, that <hi>potents potenter cruciabuntur,</hi> great men shall be
greatly tormented if they sin; and to fall from a great height is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
ruine. Severe were the words of our Blessed Saviour, <hi>Ye are
the Salt of the earth; if the Salt have lost his savour, it is thenceforth good
for nothing, neither for Land, nor yet for the Dunghil:</hi> a greater disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
could not be expressed; he that takes such a one up will shake his
fingers. I end this with the saying of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> 
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">Let your religious
prudence think that in the world, especially at this time,<note place="margin">Epist. 148.</note> nothing is more

                  <p>NOW by the order of the words and my own undertaking,
I am to tell you what are the Rules and Measures of your
Doctrine which you are to teach the people.</p>
                  <p>1. Be sure that you teach nothing to the people, but
what is certainly to be found in Scripture: <hi>Servemus eas
mensuras quas nobis per Legislatorem Lex spiritualis enunciat;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Origen.</note> the whole
spiritual Law given us by our Law-giver, that must be our measures; for
though by perswasion and by faith, by mis-perswasion and by error, by
false Commentaries and mistaken glosses, every man may become a Law
unto himself, and unhappily bind upon his Conscience burdens which
Christ never imposed; yet you must bind nothing upon your Charges,
but what God hath bound upon you; you cannot become a Law unto
them, that's the only priviledge of the Law-giver, who, because he was
an interpreter of the Divine Will, might become a Law unto us, and
because he was faithful in all the house, did tell us all his Fathers Will;
and <hi>g.</hi> nothing can be Gods Law to us but what he hath taught us. But
of this I shall need to say no more but the words of <hi>Tertullian; Nobis
nihil licet ex nostro arbitrio indulgere, sed nec eligere aliquid quod de suo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrio
aliquis induxerit:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Centrahaeres.</note> 
                     <hi>Apostolos Domini habemus Authores, qui nec ipsi
quicquam de suo arbitrio quod inducerent elegerunt, sed acceptam à Christo
disciplinam fideliter nationibus assignarunt.</hi> Whatsoever is not in and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

certainly; <hi>for no Scripture is</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, saith S. <hi>Peter,</hi> it is not, it
cannot be <hi>of private interpretation;</hi> that is, unless it come from the Spirit of
God, which is that Spirit that mov'd upon the waters of the new Creation
as well as of the old, and was promised to all, <hi>to you and to your Children,
and to as many as the Lord our God shall call,</hi> and is bestowed on all, and is
<hi>the earnest</hi> of all <hi>our inheritance,</hi> and is <hi>given to every man to profit
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56643:101"/>
withall;</hi> it cannot prove God to be the Author, nor be a light to us to
walk by, or to show others the way to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>This Rule were alone sufficient to guide us all in the whole Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of our Calling, if we were not weak and wilful, ignorant and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
but the holy Scripture hath suffered so many interpretations, and
various sounds and seemings, and we are so prepossess'd and predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
to misconstruction by false Apostles without, and prevailing pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
within, that though it be in it self sufficient, yet it is not so for us;
and we may say with the Eunuch, <hi>How can I understand unless some man
should guide me?</hi> and indeed in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles <hi>there are many things
hard to be understood;</hi> and in many other places we find that the well is
deep, and unless there be some to help us to draw out the latent senses
of it, our souls will not be filled with the waters of Salvation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that I may do you what assistances I can, and if I cannot in this
small portion of time instruct you, yet that I may counsel you and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind
you of the best assistances that are to be had; if I cannot give you
rules sufficient to expound all hard places, yet that I may shew how you
shall sufficiently teach your people by the rare rules and precepts record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in places that are or may be made easie, I shall first give you some
advices in general, and then descend to more particular Rules and
Measures.</p>
                  <p>1. Because it is not to be expected that every Minister of the Word of
God should have all the gifts of the Spirit, and every one to abound in
Tongues, and in Doctrines, and in Interpretations; you may therefore
make great use of the Labours of those worthy persons whom God hath
made to be lights in the several Generations of the world, that a hand
may help a hand, and a Father may teach a Brother, and we all be
taught of God: for there are many who have by great skill, and great
experience, taught us many good rules for the interpretation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
amongst which those that I shall principally recommend to you,
are the Books of S. <hi>Austin, De utilitate credendi,</hi> and his 3. <hi>lib. De Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Christiana;</hi> the <hi>Synopsis</hi> of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> the <hi>prooemes</hi> of <hi>Isidore,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues</hi>
of S. <hi>Hierom;</hi> I might well adde the <hi>Scholia</hi> of <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> the <hi>Catenae</hi>
of the Greek Fathers; and of later times, the Ordinary and Interli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neary
glosses; the excellent Book of <hi>Hugo de S. Victore, de eruditione
didascaticâ; Ars interpretandi Scripturas,</hi> by <hi>Sixtus Senensis: Serarius</hi>
his <hi>Prolegomena; Tena</hi> his <hi>Introduction</hi> to the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> together with
<hi>Laurentius è Villa-Vincentio, Andreas Hyperius de ratione studii Philosophici,</hi>
and the <hi>Hypotiposes</hi> of <hi>Martinus Cantapratensis: Arias Montanus</hi> his <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
or <hi>de Arcano Sermone,</hi> is of another nature, and more fit for
Preachers, and so is <hi>Sanctes Paguine</hi> his <hi>Isagoge;</hi> but <hi>Ambrosius Cathari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
his Book <hi>duarum clavium ad sacram scripturam,</hi> is useful to many
good purposes: But more particularly, and I think more usefully, are
those seven Rules of interpreting Scriptures written by <hi>Tichonius,</hi> and
first made famous by S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s commendation of them, and inserted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> tome of the <hi>Biblioth. ss. pp. Sebastian Perez</hi> wrote 35 Rules for the
interpretation of Scripture: <hi>Franciscus Ruiz</hi> drew from the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
234 Rules: besides those many learned Persons who have writ
<hi>Vocabularies, Tropologies,</hi> and <hi>Expositions</hi> of Words and Phrases; such as
are <hi>Flacius Illyricus, Junius, Hierome Lauretus,</hi> and many others, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequent
in all publick Libraries. But I remember, that he that gives
advice to a sick man in <hi>Ireland</hi> to cure his sickness, must tell him of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments
that are <hi>facilè parabilia,</hi> easie to be had, and cheap to be
bought, or else his counsel will not profit him; and even of these God
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56643:102"/>
hath made good provision for us; for although many precious things
are reserv'd for them that dig deep and search wisely, yet there are
medicinal Plants, and Corn and Grass, things fit for Food and Physick
to be had in every field.</p>
                  <p>And so it is in the Interpretation of Scripture; there are ways of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it well and wisely without the too laborious methods of weary
Learning, that even the meanest Labourers in Gods Vineyard may have
that which is fit to minister to him that needs. <hi>g.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. In all the Interpretations of Scripture the literal sense is to be
presum'd and chosen, unless there be evident cause to the contrary.
The reasons are plain; because the literal sense is natural, and it is first,
and it is most agreeable to some things in their whole kind; not indeed
to Prophesies, nor to the Teachings of the Learned, nor those Cryptick
ways of institution by which the Ancients did hide a light, and keep
it in a dark lanthorn from the temeration of ruder handlings and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Preachers: but the literal sense is agreeable to Laws, to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of Commands, to the revelation of the Divine Will, to the
Concerns of the Vulgar, to the foundations of Faith, and to all the
notice of things, in which the Idiot is as much concern'd as the
greatest Clerks. From which Proposition these three Corollaries will
properly follow; 1. That God hath plainly and literally describ'd all
his Will both in belief and practice, in which our essential duty, the
duty of all men is concern'd. 2. That in plain expressions we are to
look for our duty, and not in the more secret places and darker corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Scripture. 3. That you may regularly, certainly and easily
do your duty to the people, if you read and literally expound the
plain sayings, and easily expressed Commandments, and Promises and
Threatnings of the Gospel, and the Psalms and the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>3. But then remember this also; That not only the Grammatical or
prime signification of the word is the literal sense; but whatsoever is
the prime intention of the speaker, that is the literal sense; though the
word be to be taken metaphorically, or by translation signifie more
things than one. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous;</hi> this is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
true; and yet it is as true, that God hath no eyes properly:
but by [eyes] are meant, <hi>Gods providence;</hi> and though this be not the
first literal sense of the word [eyes] it is not that which was at first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
and contingently; but it is that signification which was seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
impos'd, and by reason and proportion. Thus when we say <hi>God
cares for the righteous,</hi> it will not suppose that God can have any anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
or afflictive thoughts; but [<hi>he cares</hi>] does as truly and properly
signifie provision, as caution; beneficence, as fear; and <hi>g.</hi> the literal
sense of it is, that God provides good things for the righteous. For in
this case the rule of <hi>Abulensis</hi> is very true; <hi>Sensus literalis semper est ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
the literal sense is always true; that is, all that is true which the
Spirit of God intended to signifie by the words; whether he intended
the first or second signification; whether that of voluntary and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
or that of analogical and rational institution. <hi>Other Sheep have
I,</hi> said Christ, <hi>which are not of this fold:</hi> that he did not mean this of
the <hi>pecus lanigerum</hi> is notorious; but of the Gentiles to be gathered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the priviledges and fold of <hi>Israel:</hi> For in many cases the first literal
sense is the hardest, and sometimes impossible, and sometimes inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient;
and when it is any of these, although we are not to recede from
the literal sense; yet we are to take the second signification, the tropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
or figurative. <hi>If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out,</hi> said Christ:
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56643:102"/>
and yet no man digs his eyes out; because the very letter or intention
of this Command bids us only to throw away that, which if we keep,
we cannot avoid sin: for sometimes the letter tells the intention, and
sometimes the intention declares the letter; and that is properly the
literal sense which is the first meaning of the Command in the whole
complexion: and in this, common sense, and a vulgar reason will be a
sufficient guide, because there is always some other thing spoken by
God, or some principle naturally implanted in us, by which we are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
in the understanding of the Divine Command. <hi>He that does not
hate Father and Mother for my sake, is not worthy of me:</hi> the literal
sense of <hi>hating</hi> us'd in Scripture is not always <hi>malice,</hi> but sometimes a
<hi>less loving;</hi> and so Christ also hath expounded it: <hi>He that loves Father
or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> But I shall not insist long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
on this; he that understands nothing but his Grammar, and hath
not convers'd with men and books, and can see no farther then his fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ends, and makes no use of his reason, but for ever will be a child;
he may be deceiv'd in the literal sense of Scripture;<note place="margin">Verbi non son<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> sed sensu sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt. <hi>Hilar.</hi>
                     </note> but then he is not
fit to teach others: but he that knows words signifie Rhetorically as
well as Grammatically, and have various proper significations, and
which of these is the first is not always of it self easie to be told; and
remembers also that God hath given him reason, and observation, and
experience, and conversation with wise men, and the proportion of
things, and the end of the Command, and parallel places of Scripture
in other words to the same purpose; will conclude, that since in plain
places all the duty of man is contain'd, and that the literal sense is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
true, and (unless men be wilful or infortunate) they may with
a small proportion of Learning find out the literal sense of an easie
Moral Proposition: will I say conclude, that if we be deceiv'd, the
fault is our own; but the fault is so great, the man so supine, the
negligence so inexcusable, that the very consideration of humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
is not sufficient to excuse such Teachers of others, who halluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
or praevaricate in this. The <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> fell foully in this
matter, and supposed God to have a face, and arms, and passions as we
have; but they prevail'd not: And <hi>Origen</hi> was in one instance greatly
mistaken, and thinking there was no literal meaning but the prime sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the word, understood the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to make an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,
to his own prejudice; but that passed not into a doctrine: But
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath err'd greatly in pertinacious adhering, not to
the Letter, but to the Grammar; nor to that but in one line or signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it: and <hi>Hoc est corpus meum</hi> must signifie nothing but Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically;
and though it be not by their own confessions to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
without divers figures in the whole complexion, yet peevishly
and perversly they will take it by the wrong handle; and this they
have pass'd into a doctrine that is against sense and reason, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and Scripture and Tradition, and the common interpretation of
things, and publick peace and utility, and every thing by which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
ought to be govern'd and determin'd.</p>
                  <p>4. I am to adde this one thing more; That we admit in the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Scripture but one literal sense; I say, but one <hi>prime literal
sense;</hi> for the simplicity and purity of the Spirit, and the philanthropy
of God will not admit that there should in one single Proposition be
many intricate meanings, or that his sense should not certainly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
or that the people be abus'd by aequivocal and doubtful
senses; this was the way of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the sands, and <hi>Apollo Pythius,</hi>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:56643:103"/>
and the Devils oracles: but be it far from the wisdom of the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>5. But then take in this Caution to it; That although there be but
one principal literal sense, yet others that are subordinate may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
subordinately; and others that are true by proportion, or that
first intention, may be true for many reasons, and every reason applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to a special instance; and all these may be intended as they signifie,
that is, one only by prime design, and the other by collateral conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
Thus when it is said, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten
thee;</hi> the Psalmist means it of the eternal generation of Christ; others
seem to apply it to his birth of the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
it <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. of the Resurrection of Christ: This is all true; and
yet but one literal sense primely meant; but by proportion to the first
the others have their place, and are meant by way of similitude. Thus
we are the Sons of God, by adoption, by creation, by favour, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of the Spirit, by the <hi>laver of regeneration;</hi> and every man for
one or other of these reasons can say <hi>Our Father which art in heaven;</hi>
and these are all, parts of the literal sense, not different, but subordinate
and by participation: but more than one prime literal sense must not
be admitted.</p>
                  <p>6. Lastly; Sometimes the literal sense is lost by a plain change of the
words; which when it is discover'd, it must be corrected by the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
and till it be, so long as it is pious, and commonly receiv'd, it may
be us'd without scruple. In the 41. Psalm the <hi>Hebrews</hi> read, <hi>My soul
hath longed after the strong, the living God; Deum fortem, vivum:</hi> In
the vulgar Latine, it is <hi>Deum fontem vivum,</hi> the living fountain; and
it was very well, but not the literal sense of Gods Spirit: But when they
have been so often warned of it, that they were still in love with their
own letter and leave the words of the Spirit, I think was not justifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at all: And this was observ'd at last by <hi>Sixtus</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> and
corrected in their Editions of the Bible, and then it came right again.
The sum is this; he that with this moderation and these measures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strues
the plain meaning of the Spirit of God, and expounds the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith, and the Precepts of Life according to the intention of
God signified by his own words, in their first or second signification,
cannot easily be cousen'd into any Heretical Doctrine; but his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
will be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the pure word and mind of God.</p>
                  <p>2. There is another sense or interpretation of Scripture, and that is
mystical or spiritual; which the Jews call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Midrash;</hi> which <hi>Elias</hi>
the Levite calls <hi>omne commentarium quod non est juxta simplicem &amp; lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralem
sensum,</hi> every gloss that is not according to their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Peschat,</hi> to
the literal sense; and this relates principally to the Old Testament:
Thus the waters of the Deluge did signifie the waters of Baptism; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
and <hi>Agar,</hi> the Law and the Gospel; the brazen Serpent, the Passion
of Christ; the conjunction of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> the communion of Christ
and his Church; and this is called <hi>the spiritual sense,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> being our
warrant; <hi>Our Fathers eat of the same spiritual meat, and drank of that
same spiritual rock;</hi> now that rock was not spiritual, but of solid stone;
but it signified spiritually; for <hi>that rock was Christ.</hi> This sense the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
divide into Tropological, Allegorical, and Anagogical; for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
sake, and either to distinguish the things, or to amuse the persons:
for these relate but to the several spiritual things signified by divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
as <hi>matters of faith, precepts of manners,</hi> and <hi>celestial joys:</hi> you
may make more if you please, and yet these are too many to trouble
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56643:103"/>
mens heads, and to make Theology an art and craft to no purpose.
This spiritual sense is that which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or the sense
that lies under the cover of words: Concerning this I shall give you
these short Rules, that your Doctrine be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, pure and without
heretical mixtures, and the leaven of false Doctrines; for above all
things this is to be taken care of.</p>
                  <p>1. Although every place of Scripture hath a literal sense, either
proper or figurative, yet every one hath not a spiritual and mystical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation;
and <hi>g. Origen</hi> was blam'd by the Ancients for forming all
into spirit and mystery; one place was reserv'd to punish that folly.
Thus the followers of the Family of love and the Quakers expound all
the Articles of our Faith, all the hopes of a Christian, all the stories
of Christ into such a clancular and retir'd sense, as if they had no
meaning by the letter, but were only an Hieroglyphick or a Phythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean
Scheme; and not to be opened but by a private key, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man pretends to be borrowed from the Spirit of God, though made
in the forges here below: To which purposes the Epistles of S. <hi>Hierom</hi>
to <hi>Avitus,</hi> to <hi>Pammachius</hi> and <hi>Oceanus</hi> are worth your reading. In this
case men do as he said of <hi>Origen, Ingenii sui acumina putant esse Ecclesiae
Sacramenta;</hi> Every man believes God meant as he intended, and so
he will obtrude his own dreams instead of Sacraments. <hi>g.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Whoever will draw spiritual senses from any History of the Old
or New Testament, must first allow the literal sense, or else he will
soon deny an Article of necessary belief. A story is never the less true,
because it is intended to profit as well as to please; and the narrative
may well establish or insinuate a precept and instruct with pleasure; but
if because there is a Jewel in the golden Cabinet, you will throw away
the inclosure, and deny the story that you may look out a mystical
sense, we shall leave it arbitrary for any man to believe or disbelieve
what story he please; and <hi>Eve</hi> shall not be made of the rib of <hi>Adam,</hi>
and the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> shall be no more then the <hi>Hesperides,</hi> and the
story of <hi>Jonas</hi> a well dress'd fable: and I have seen all the Revelation of
S. <hi>John</hi> turn'd into a moral Commentary in which every person can sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
any proposition, or any virtue, according as his fancy chimes. This
is too much, and therefore comes not from a good principle.</p>
                  <p>3. In Moral Precepts, in Rules of Polity and Oeconomy there is no
other sense to be inquired after but what they bear upon the face; for
he that thinks it necessary to turn them into some further spiritual
meaning, supposes that it is a disparagement to the Spirit of God to take
care of Governments, or that the duties of Princes and Masters are no
great Concerns, or not operative to eternal felicity, or that God does
not provide for temporal advantages; for if these things be worthy
Concerns, and if God hath taken care of all our Good, and if <hi>godliness
be profitable to all things, and hath the promise of the life that now is and
that which is to come,</hi> there is no necessity to pass on to more abstruse
senses, when the literal and proper hath also in it instrumentality enough
towards very great spiritual purposes. <hi>God takes care</hi> for servants, yea
<hi>for Oxen,</hi> and all the beasts of the field; and the letter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
enjoyning us to use them with mercy, hath in it an advantage
even upon the spirit and whole frame of a mans soul: and <hi>g.</hi> let no man
tear those Scriptures to other meanings beyond their own intentions
and provisions. In these cases, a spiritual sense is not to be inquired
after.</p>
                  <p>4. If the letter of the story inferres any undecency or contradiction,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56643:104"/>
then it is necessary that a spiritual or mystical sense be thought of; but
never else is it necessary. It may in other cases be useful, when it does
advantage to holiness; and may be safely us'd, if us'd modestly; but
because this spiritual or mystical interpretation when it is not necessary
cannot be certainly prov'd, but relies upon fancy, or at most, some
light inducement; no such interpretation can be us'd as an argument to
prove an Article of Faith, nor relied upon in matters of necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern:
The <hi>three measures of meal</hi> in the Gospel, are but an ill argument
to prove the Blessed and Eternal Trinity; and it may be the three
Angels that came to <hi>Abraham</hi> will signifie no more than the two that
came to <hi>Lot,</hi> or the single one to <hi>Manoah,</hi> or S. <hi>John;</hi> this Divine
Mystery relies upon a more sure foundation; and he makes it unsure
that causes it to lean upon an unexpounded vision that was sent to other
purposes. <hi>Non esse contentiosis &amp; infidelibus sensibus ingerendum,</hi> said
S. <hi>Austin</hi> of the Book of <hi>Genesis:</hi> Searching for Articles of Faith in the
by-paths and corners of secret places, leads not to faith but to infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and by making the foundations unsure, causes the Articles to
be questioned.</p>
                  <p>I remember that <hi>Agricola</hi> in his Book de <hi>animalibus subterraneis</hi> tells
of a certain kind of spirits that use to converse in Mines and trouble
the poor Labourers: They dig mettals, they cleanse, they cast, they
melt, they separate, they joyn the Ore; but when they are gone,
the men find just nothing done, not one step of their work set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
So it is in the Books and Expositions of many men; They stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
they argue, they expound, they confute, they reprove, they open
secrets, and make new discoveries; and when you turn the bottom
upwards, up starts nothing; no man is the wiser, no man is instructed,
no truth discover'd, no proposition clear'd, nothing is alter'd, but that
much labour and much time is lost; and this is manifest in nothing
more than in Books of Contrversie, and in mystical Expositions of
Scripture:<note place="margin">Isid Orig. l. 6. c. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Quaerunt quod nusquam est, inveniunt tamen;</hi> Like <hi>Isidore</hi>
who in contemplation of a Pen observ'd that the nib of it was divided
into two, but yet the whole body remain'd one: <hi>Credo propter mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi>
he found a knack in it, and thought it was a mystery. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which I shall need to say no more but that they are safe when they
are necessary, and they are useful when they teach better; and they
are good when they do good: but this is so seldom and so by chance,
that oftentimes if a man be taught truth, he is taught it by a lying Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
it is like being cur'd by a good witch, an evil spirit hath an hand
in it; and if there be not errour and illusion in such interpretations,
there is very seldom any certainty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What shall I do to my vineyard said God:</hi> Isai. 5. <hi>Auferam sepem ejus;</hi>
I will take away the hedge, that is, <hi>custodiam Angelorum</hi> saith the gloss,
the custody of their Angel guardians: and <hi>Isai.</hi> 9. God says, <hi>Manasseh
humeros suos comedit, Manasseh</hi> hath devour'd his own shoulders; that
is, <hi>gubernatores dimovit</hi> say the Doctors, hath remov'd his Governours,
his Princes and his Priests; it is a sad complaint 'tis true; but what it
means is the Question: but although these senses are pious and may be
us'd for illustration and the prettiness of discourse; yet there is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
certainty in them than what the one fancies and the other is pleas'd
to allow. But if the spiritual sense be prov'd, evident and certain then
it is of the same efficacy as the literal; for it is according to that letter
by which Gods Holy Spirit was pleas'd to signifie his meaning; and it
matters not how he is pleas'd to speak, so we understand his meaning:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56643:104"/>
and in this sense that is true which is affirm'd by S. <hi>Gregory; Allegoriam
interdum aedificare fidem;</hi> sometimes our faith is built up by the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
words of the Spirit of God. But because it seldom happens that
they can be prov'd, <hi>g.</hi> you are not to feed your flocks with such herbs
whose virtue you know not, of whose wholesomness or powers of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
you are wholly or for the most part ignorant: we have seen
and felt the mischief, and sometimes derided the absurdity: <hi>God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
the Sun and the Moon,</hi> said <hi>Moses;</hi> that is, said the extravagants of
Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, the Pope and the Emperour: And <hi>Behold here are
two swords</hi> said <hi>S. Peter: It is enough</hi> said Christ; enough for S. <hi>Peter;</hi>
and so he got the two swords, the temporal and spiritual, said the gloss
upon that Text. Of these things there is no beginning, and no end;
no certain principles, and no good conclusion.</p>
                  <p>These are the two ways of expounding all Scriptures; these are as
<hi>the two witnesses of God,</hi> by the first of which he does most commonly,
and by the latter of which he does sometimes declare his meaning;
and in the discovery of these meanings, the Measures which I have now
given you are the general land-marks, and are sufficient to guide us
from destructive errours. It follows in the next place, that I give you
some Rules that are more particular according to my undertaking, that
you in your duty, and your charges in the provisions to be made for
them may be more secure.</p>
                  <p>1. Although you are to teach your people nothing but what is the
Word of God; yet by this Word I understand all that God spake ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
and all that by certain consequence can be deduced from it.
Thus <hi>Dionysius Alexandrinus</hi> argues, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>;
he that in Scripture is called the Son and the Word of the
Father, I conclude he is no stranger to the essence of the Father: And
S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> derided them that called for express Scripture for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
since the Prophets and the Gospels acknowledge the unity of substance
in the Father and the Son; and we easily conclude the Holy Ghost to
be God, because we call upon him; and we call upon him, because we
believe in him; and we believe in him, because we are baptized into
the faith and profession of the Holy Ghost. This way of teaching our
Blessed Saviour us'd when he confuted the Sadduces in the Question of
the Resurrection;<note place="margin">John 10. 37.</note> and thus he confuted the Pharisees in the Question
of his being the Son of God. The use I make of it is this, that right
reason is so far from being an exile from the inquiries of Religion, that
it is the great ensurance of many propositions of faith; and we have
seen the faith of men strangely alter, but the reason of man can
never alter; every rational truth supposing its principles, being eternal
and unchangeable. All that is to be done here, is to see that you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
well, that your deduction be evident, that your reason be right:
for Scripture is to our understandings as the grace of God to our wills;
that instructs our reason, and this helps our wills; and we may as well
chuse the things of God without our wills, and delight in them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
love, as understand the Scriptures or make use of them without
reason.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But how shall our reason be guided, that it may be right, that
it be not a blind guide, but direct us to the place where the star ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
and point us to the very house where the babe lieth; that we
may indeed do as the wise men did? To this I answer.</p>
                  <p>2. In the making deductions the first great measure to direct our
reason and our inquiries is the analogy of faith: that is, let the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56643:105"/>
of faith be your <hi>Cynosura,</hi> your great light to walk by; and
whatever you derive from thence let it be agreeable to the principles
from whence they come. It is the rule of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>Let him that prophesies do it according to the proportion of faith;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 7.</note>
that is, let him teach nothing but what is revealed, or agreeable to the
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the prime credibilities of Christianity; that is, by the plain
words of Scripture let him expound the less plain, and the superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
by the measures of the foundation, and doctrines be answerable
to faith, and speculations relating to practice, and nothing taught as
simply necessary to be believed, but what is evidently and plainly set
down in the holy Scriptures; for he that calls a proposition necessary,
which the Apostles did not declare to be so, or which they did not teach
to all Christians learned and unlearned, he is gone beyond his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For every thing is to be kept in that order where God hath
plac'd it: there is a classis of necessary Articles, and that is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls <hi>regulam fidei,</hi> the rule of faith; and
according to this we must teach necessities; but what comes after this,
is not so necessary; and he that puts upon his own doctrines a weight
equal to this of the Apostles declaration, either must have an Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
authority, and an Apostolical infallibility, or else he transgresses
the proportion of faith, and becomes a false Apostle.</p>
                  <p>3. To this purpose it is necessary that you be very diligent in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
laborious and assiduous in the studies of Scripture: not only lest
ye be blind seers, and blind guides; but because without great skill and
learning ye cannot do your duty. A Minister may as well sin by his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
as by his negligence; because when light springs from so many
angles, that may enlighten us, unless we look round about us and be
skill'd in all the angles of reflection, we shall but turn our backs upon
the Sun, and see nothing but our own shadows. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi>
said Christ; <hi>Non dixit legite, sed scrutamini,</hi> said S. <hi>Chrysostome; quia
oportet profundius effodere, ut quae altè delitescunt invenire possimus.</hi>
Christ did not say, read, but search the Scriptures; turn over every
page, inquire narrowly, look diligently, converse with them perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
be mighty in the Scriptures: for that which is plain there, is the
best measures of our faith and of our doctrines. The Jews have a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>Qui non advertit quod supra &amp; infra in Scriptoribus legitur, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertit
verba Dei viventis:</hi> He that will understand Gods meaning, must
look above and below, and round about; for the meaning of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God is not like the wind blowing from one point, but like light
issuing from the body of the Sun; it is light round about; and in
every word of God there is a treasure, and something will be found
somewhere to answer every doubt, and to clear every obscurity, and
to teach every truth by which God intends to perfect our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
But then, take this rule with you; Do not pass from plainess to
obscurity, nor from simple principles draw crafty conclusions, nor
from easiness pass into difficulty, nor from wise notices draw intricate
nothings, nor from the wisdom of God lead your hearers into the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of men; your principles are easie, and your way plain, and the
words of faith are open, and what naturally flows from thence will be
as open; but if without violence and distortion it cannot be drawn
forth, the proposition is not of the family of faith. <hi>Qui nimis emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,
elicit sanguinem;</hi> he that wrings too hard, draws blood; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is fit to be offer'd to your charges and your flocks but what flows
naturally and comes easily, and descends readily and willingly from
the fountains of salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:56643:105"/>
4. Next to this analogy or proportion of faith, let the consent of
the Catholick Church be your measure, so as by no means to prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in any doctrine in which all Christians always have consented.
This will appear to be a necessary Rule by and by; but in the mean time,
I shall observe to you, that it will be the safer because it cannot go far;
it can be instanced but in three things, in the Creed, in Ecclesiastical
Government, and in external forms of worship and Liturgy. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church hath been too much and too soon divided: it hath
been us'd as the man upon a hill us'd his heap of heads in a Basket; when
he threw them down the hill, every head run his own way, <hi>quot capita
tot sentèntiae;</hi> and as soon as the Spirit of Truth was opposed by the
Spirit of Error, the Spirit of peace was disordered by the Spirit of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision:
and the Spirit of God hath over-power'd us so far, that we are
only fallen out about that, of which if we had been ignorant we had
not been much the worse; but in things simply necessary, God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
us still unbroken; all Nations, and all Ages recite the Creed, and
all pray the Lords Prayer, and all pretend to walk by the Rule of the
Commandments; and all Churches have ever kept the day of Christs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
or the Lords day holy; and all Churches have been govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Bishops, and the Rites of Christianity have been for ever admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
by separate Orders of men, and those men have been always
set apart by Prayer and the imposition of the Bishops hands; and all
Christians have been baptized, and all baptized persons were or ought
to be, and were taught that they should be confirm'd by the Bishop, and
Presidents of Religion; and for ever there were publick forms of Prayer,
more or less in all Churches; and all Christians that were to enter into
holy wedlock, were ever joined or blessed by the Bishop or the Priest:
in these things all Christians ever have consented, and he that shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
or expound Scripture to the prejudice of any of these things, hath
no part in that Article of his Creed; he does not believe the Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, he hath no fellowship, no communion with the Saints
and Servants of God.</p>
                  <p>It is not here intended that the doctrine of the Church should be the
Rule of Faith distinctly from, much less against the Scripture; for that
were a contradiction to suppose the Church of God, and yet speaking
and acting against the will of God; but it means, that where the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is concerning an obscure place of Scripture, the practice of the
Catholick Church is the best Commentary. <hi>Intellectus qui cum praxi
concurrit, est spiritus vivificans,</hi> said <hi>Cusanus.</hi> Then we speak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Spirit of God, when we understand Scripture in that sense in
which the Church of God hath always practis'd it. <hi>Quod pluribus, quod
sapientibus, quod omnibus videtur,</hi> that's <hi>Aristotles</hi> Rule; and it is a Rule
of Nature; every thing puts on a degree of probability as it is witnessed
by wise men, by many wise men, by all wise men: and it is <hi>Vincentius Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinensis</hi>
great Rule of truth; <hi>Quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus:</hi>
and he that goes against what is said always, and every where, and by all
Christians, had need have a new revelation, or an infallible spirit, or
he hath an intolerable pride and foolishness of presumption. Out of
the Communion of the Universal Church no man can be saved; they
are the body of Christ; and the whole Church cannot perish, and
Christ cannot be a head without a body, and he will for ever be our
Redeemer, and for ever intercede for his Church, and be glorious in his
Saints; and <hi>g.</hi> he that does not sow in these furrows, but leaves the way
of the whole Church, hath no pretence for his errour, no excuse for
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56643:106"/>
his pride, and will find no alleviation of his punishment. These are the
best measures which God hath given us to lead us in the way of truth,
and to preserve us from false doctrines; and whatsoever cannot be
prov'd by these measures, cannot be necessary. There are many truths
besides these; but if your people may be safely ignorant of them, you
may quietly let them alone, and not trouble their heads with what
they have so little to do: things that need not to be known at all, need
not to be taught: for if they be taught, they are not certain, or are
not very useful; and <hi>g.</hi> there may be danger in them besides the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and since God hath not made them necessary, they may be let
alone without danger; and it will be madness to tell stories to your
flocks of things which may hinder salvation, but cannot do them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
And now it is time that I have done with the first great remark of
doctrine noted by the Apostle in my Text; all the Guides of souls
must take care that the doctrine they teach be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,</hi>
the word of God, the truth of the Spirit. That which remains
is easier.</p>
                  <p>2. In the next place it must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, grave, and reverend, no vain
notions, no pitiful contentions, and disputes about little things, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
your great employment in the ministery of souls: and in this
the Rules are easie and ready.</p>
                  <p>1. Do not trouble your people with controversies: whatsoever does
gender strife the Apostle commands us to avoid; and <hi>g.</hi> much more
the strife it self: a controversie is a stone in the mouth of the hearer,
who should be fed with bread, and it is a temptation to the Preacher,
it is a state of temptation; it engages, one side in lying, and both in
uncertainty and uncharitableness; and after all, it is not food for souls;
it is the food of contention, it is a spiritual law-suit, and it can never
be ended; every man is right, and every man is wrong in these things,
and no man can tell who is right or who is wrong. For as long as a
word can be spoken against a word, and a thing be opposite to a thing;
as long as places are hard, and men are ignorant or <hi>knowing but in part;</hi>
as long as there is money and pride in the world, and for ever till men
willingly confess themselves to be fools and deceiv'd, so long will the
saw of contention be drawn from side to side. <hi>That which is not cannot
be numbred,</hi> saith the Wise man: no man can reckon upon any truth
that is got by contentious learning; and whoever troubles his people
with questions, and teaches them to be troublesome, note that man, he
loves not peace, or he would fain be called <hi>Rabbi, Rabbi.</hi> Christian
Religion loves not tricks nor artifices of wonder, but like the natural
and amiable simplicity of Jesus, by plain and easie propositions leads us
in wise paths to a place where sin and strife shall never enter. What
good can come from that which fools begin, and wise men can never
end but by silence, and that had been the best way at first, and would
have stifled them in the Cradle? What have your people to do whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christs body be in the Sacrament by <hi>Consubstantiation,</hi> or <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation;</hi>
whether Purgatory be in the centre of the earth or in the
air, or any where or no where? and who but a mad man would trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
their heads with the intangled links of the phantatick chain of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination?
Teach them to fear God and honour the King, to keep
the Commandments of God, and the Kings Commands because of the
oath of God; learn them to be sober and temperate, to be just and to
pay their debts, to speak well of their neighbours and to think meanly of
themselves; teach them charity, and learn them to be zealous of good
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56643:106"/>
works. Is it not a shame that the people should be fill'd with Sermons
against Ceremonies, and Declamations against a Surplice, and tedious
Harangues against the poor aëry sign of the Cross in Baptism? These
things teach them to be ignorant; it fills them with wind, and they such
dry nurses; it makes them lazy and useless, troublesome and good for
nothing. Can the definition of a Christian be, that a Christian is a man
that rails against Bishops and the Common Prayer-book? and yet this is
the great labour of our neighbours that are crept in among us; this they
call the work of the Lord; and this is the great matter of the desir'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
in these things they spend their long breath, and about
these things they spend earnest prayers, and by these they judge their
brother, and for these they revile their Superiour, and in this doughty
cause they think it fit to fight and dye. If S. <hi>Paul</hi> or S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> S. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi>
or S. <hi>Ambrose;</hi> if any of the primitive Confessors or glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
should awake from within their curtains of darkness, and find
men thus striving against Government for the interest of disobedience,
and labouring for nothings, and preaching all day for shadows and
Moon-shine; and that not a word shall come from them to teach the
people humility, not a word of obedience or self-denial; they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
taught to suspect their own judgment, but always to prefer the
private Minister before the publick, the Presbyter before a Bishop,
Fancy before Law, the Subject before his Prince, a Prayer in which
men consider not at all, before that which is weighed wisely and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
and in short, a private spirit before the publick, and <hi>Mas John</hi>
before the Patriarch of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> if, I say, S. <hi>Paul</hi> or S. <hi>Anthony</hi> should
see such a light, they would not know the meaning of it, nor of what
Religion the Country were, nor from whence they had deriv'd their
new nothing of an institution. <hi>The Kingdom of God consists in wisdom
and righteousness, in peace and holiness, in meekness and gentleness, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
and purity, in abstinence from evil and doing good to others;</hi> in these
things place your labours, preach these things, and nothing else but
such as these; things which promote the publick peace and publick
good; things that can give no offence to the wise and to the virtuous:
For these things are profitable to men, and pleasing to God.</p>
                  <p>2. Let not your Sermons and Discourses to your people be busie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings
about hard places of Scripture; if you strike a hard against a
hard, you may chance to strike fire, or break a mans head; but it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
makes a good building: <hi>Philosophiam ad syllabus vocare,</hi> that's to
no purpose; your Sermons must be for edification, something to make
the people better and wiser, <hi>wiser unto salvation,</hi> not wiser to discourse;
for if a hard thing get into their heads, I know not what work you will
make of it, but they will make nothing of it, or something that is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
strange: Dress your people unto the imagery of Christ, dress them
for their funerals, help them to make their accounts up against the day
of Judgment. I have known some Persons and some Families that
would religiously educate their Children,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> and bring them up in the
Scriptures from their cradle; and they would teach them to tell who
was the first man, and who was the oldest, and who was the wisest, and
who was the strongest; but I never observ'd them to ask who was the
best, and what things were requir'd to make a man good: the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed was not the entertainment of their pretty talkings, nor the
Life of Christ, the story of his bitter Passion; and his incomparable
Sermon on the Mount went not into their Catechisms. What good can
your flocks receive if you discourse well and wisely, whether <hi>Jephthab</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:56643:107"/>
sacrificed his daughter or put her into the retirements of a solitary life;
nor how <hi>David</hi>'s numbring the people did differ from <hi>Joshua</hi>'s; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God took away the life of <hi>Moses</hi> by a Apoplexy or by the kisses of
his mouth? If Scholars be idly busie in these things in the Schools, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
and some other little accidents may help to excuse them; but
the time that is spent in your Churches and conversation with your
people must not be so thrown away: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that's your rule;
<hi>let your speech be grave</hi> and wise, and useful and holy, and intelligible;
something to reform their manners, to correct their evil natures, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
their foolish customs; <hi>to build them up in a most holy faith.</hi> That's
the second rule and measure of your preachings that the Apostle
gives you in my Text.</p>
                  <p>3. Your speech must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, salutary and wholesome: and indeed this
is of greatest concerne, next to the first, next to the truth and purity
of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that doctrine; for unlesse the doctrine be made fit for the necessities
of your people, and not only be good in it self, but good for them, you
lose the end of your labours, and they the end of your preachings; <hi>your
preaching is vain, and their faith is also vain.</hi> The particulars of this
are not many, but very useful.</p>
                  <p>1. It is never out of season to preach good works; but when you do, be
careful that you never indirectly disgrace them by telling how your
adversaries spoil them. I do not speak this in vain; for too many of us
account good works to be Popery, and so not only dishonour our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and open wide the mouths of adversaries, but disparage Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
it self, while we hear it preached in every Pulpit, that they who
preach good works, think they merit heaven by it; and so for fear of
merit, men let the work alone; to secure a true opinion they neglect a
good practice, and out of hatred of Popery, we lay aside Christianity it
self. Teach them how to do good works, and yet to walk humbly with
God; for better it is to do well even upon a weak account, than to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon the stock of a better proposition: and let it never be used any
more as a word of reproach unto us all, that the faith of a <hi>Protestant,</hi> and
the works of a <hi>Papist,</hi> and the words of a <hi>Phanatick</hi> make up a good
Christian. Believe well, and speak well, and do well; but in doing good
works a man cannot deceive any one but himself by the apendage of a
foolish opinion; but in our believing only and in talking, a man may
deceive himself, and all the world; and God only can be safe from the
cousenage. Like to this is the case of external forms of worship, which
too many refuse, because they pretend that many who use them, rest in
them and pass no further: For besides that no sect of men teaches their
people so to do, you cannot without uncharitableness suppose it true of
very many. But if others do ill, do not you do so too; and leave not out
the external forms for fear of formality, but joyn the inward power of
godliness; and then they are reproved best, and instructed wisely, and
you are secured. But remember, that prophaneness is commonly something
that is external; and he is a prophane person who neglects the exterior
part of Religion: and this is so vile a crime, that hypocrisie while it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discovered
is not so much mischievous as open prophaneness, or a neglect
and contempt of external Religion. Do not despise external Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it may be sincere, and do not rely upon it wholly, because it may be
counterfeit; but do you preach both, and practise both; both what may
glorifie God in publick, and what may please him in private.</p>
                  <p>2. In deciding the questions and causes of Conscience of your flocks,
never strive to speak what is pleasing, but what is profitable, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56643:107"/>
as was said of <hi>Isidor</hi> the Philosopher; you must
not give your people words, but things, and substantial food. Let not the
people be prejudiced in the matter of their souls upon any terms what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
and be not ashamed to speak boldly in the cause of God; for he
that is angry when he is reproved, is not to be considered, excepting only
to be reproved again; if he will never mend, not you, but he will
have the worst of it; but if he ever mends, he will thank you for your
love, and for your wisdom, and for your care: and no man is finally
disgraced for speaking of a truth; onely here, pray for the grace of
prudence, that you may speak opportunely and wisely, lest you profit not,
but destroy an uncapable subject.</p>
                  <p>Lastly; The Apostle requires of every Mnister of the Gospel that his
speech and doctrine should be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>unreprovable:</hi> not such against
which no man can cavil; for the Pharisees found fault with the wise
discourses of the eternal Son of God; and Hereticks and Schismaticks
prated against the Holy Apostles and their excellent Sermons; but
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is such as deserves no blame, and needs no pardon, and flatters
not for praise, and begs no excuses, and makes no Apologies; a discourse
that will be justified by all the sons of wisdom: now that yours may be
so, the preceding rules are the best means that are imaginable. For
so long as you speak the pure truths of God, the plain meaning of the
Spirit, the necessary things of Faith, the useful things of Charity, and
the excellencies of Holiness, who can reprove your doctrine? But there
is something more in this word which the Apostle means, else it had
been an uselesse repetition: and a man may speak the truths of God, and
yet may be blame-worthy by an importune, unseasonable and imprudent
way of delivering them, or for want of such conduct which will place
him and his doctrine in reputation and advantages. To this purpose
these advices may be useful.</p>
                  <p>1. Be more careful to establish a truth than to reprove an error. For
besides that a truth will when it is established, of it self reprove the error
sufficiently; men will be lesse apt to reprove your truth, when they are
not ingaged to defend their own propositions against you. Men stand
upon their guard, when you proclaim war against their doctrine. Teach
your doctrine purely and wisely, and without any angry reflexions; for
you shall very hardly perswade him whom you go about publickly
to confute.</p>
                  <p>2. If any man have a revelation or a discovery of which thou knowest
nothing but by his preaching, be not too quick to condemn it; not
onely lest thou discourage his labour and stricter inquiries in the search
of truth, but lest thou also be a fool upon record; for so is every man
that hastily judges what he slowly understands. Is it not a monument
of a lasting reproach, that one of the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> condemned the
Bishop of <hi>Sulzback</hi> for saying that there were <hi>Antipodes?</hi> and is not
Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> deserted by his own party for correcting the Sermons of
<hi>Berengarius,</hi> and making him recant into a worse error? and posterity
will certainly make themselves very merry with the wise sentences made
lately at <hi>Rome</hi> against <hi>Galileo,</hi> and the <hi>Jansemists.</hi> To condemn one
truth is more shameful than to broach two errors: for he that in an
honest and diligent inquiry misses something of the mark, will have the
Apologies of humane infirmity, and the praise of doing his best; but
he that condemns a truth when it is told him, is an envious fool, and is a
murderer of his Brothers fame, and his Brothers reason.</p>
                  <p>3. Let no man upon his own head reprove the Religion that is
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56643:108"/>
established by Law and a just supreme Authority: for no reproofs are
so severe as the reproofs of Law; and a man will very hardly defend
his opinion that is already condemned by the wisdom of all his Judges.
A mans Doctrine possibly may be true though against Law; but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, unreproveable; and a Schismatick can in no case ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this Rule of the Apostle. If something may be amiss when it is
declared by Laws, much easier may he be in an errour, who goes upon
his own account, and declares alone: and <hi>g.</hi> it is better to let things
alone than to be troublesome to our Superiours by an impertinent
wrangling for reformation. We find that some Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were
greatly prais'd, and yet they did not destroy all the Temples of the
false gods which <hi>Solomon</hi> had built; and if such publick persons might
let some things alone that were amiss, and yet be innocent, trouble not
your self that all the world is not amended according to your pattern;
see that you be perfect at home, that all be rightly reform'd there; as
for reformation of the Church, God will never call you to an account.
Some things cannot be reform'd, and very many need not, for all thy
peevish dreams; and after all, it is twenty to one but thou art mistaken,
and thy Superiour is in the right; and if thou wert not proud, thou
wouldst think so too. Certain it is, he that sows in the furrows of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
his Doctrine cannot so easily be reprov'd as he that plows and
sows alone. When <hi>Theophilus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> fell into the hands
of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monks who were ignorant and confident, they handled
him with great rudeness, because he had spoken of the immateriality of
the Divine Nature; the good man to escape their fury was forc'd to
give them crafty and soft words, saying; <hi>Vidi faciem vestram ut faciem
Dei:</hi> which because they understood in the sense of the <hi>Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites,</hi>
and thought he did so too, they let him depart in peace. When
private persons are rude against the Doctrines of Authority, they are
seldom in the right; but <hi>g.</hi> are the more fierce, as wanting the natural
supports of truth, which are Reason and Authority, gentleness and
plain conviction; and <hi>g.</hi> they fall to declamation and railing, zeal and
cruelty, trifling and arrogant confidencies. They seldom go asunder:
It is the same word in Greek that signifies, disobedience and cruelty:
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Confidence is that which will endure no
bridle, no curb, no Superiour. It is worse in the Hebrew; <hi>the Sons of
Belial,</hi> signifie people that will endure no yoke, no Government, no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
and we have found them so, they are Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> indeed.
This is that <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>4. Whatever Scriptures you pretend for your Doctrine, take heed
that it be not chargeable with foul consequences; that it lay no burden
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56643:108"/>
upon God, that it do not tempt to vanity, that it be not manifestly
serving a temporal end, and nothing else; that it be not vehemently to
be suspected to be a design of State, like the Sermon at <hi>Pauls</hi>-Cross by
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Shaw</hi> in <hi>Richard</hi> the Third's time; that it do not give countenance
and confidence to a wicked life; for then your Doctrine is reproveable
for the appendage, and the intrinsick truth or falshood will not so much
be inquir'd after as the visible and external objection: if men can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it in the outside, they will inquire no further. But above all
things nothing so much will reproach your Doctrine, as if you preach
it in a railing dialect; we have had too much of that within these last
30 years. <hi>Optatus</hi> observes it was the trick of the Donatists,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. adv. Parmen.</note> 
                     <hi>Nullus
vestrum est qui non convitia nostra suis tractatibus misceat:</hi> There is
none of you but with his own writings mingles our reproaches; you
begin to read Chapters, and you expound them to our injuries; you
comment upon the Gospel, and revile your brethren that are absent;
you imprint hatred and enmity in your peoples hearts, and you teach
them war when you pretend to make them Saints. They do so, their
Doctrine is not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; that's the least which can be said. If you
will not have your Doctrine reprehensible, <hi>do nothing with offence,</hi>
and above all offences avoid the doing or saying those things that give
offence to the King and to the Laws, to the voice of Christendom and
the publick Customs of the Church of God. Frame your life and
preachings to the Canons of the Church, to the Doctrines of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to the sense of the ancient and holy Fathers. For it is otherwise
in Theology then it is in other Learnings. The experiments of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
are rude at first, and the observations weak, and the principles
unprov'd; and he that made the first lock was not so good a work-man
as we have now adays: But in Christian Religion they that were first
were best, because God and not man was the Teacher; and ever since
that, we have been unlearning the wise notices of pure Religion, and
mingling them with humane notices and humane interest. <hi>Quod pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,
hoc verum:</hi> and although concerning Antiquity I may say as he
in the Tragedy;
<q>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>I would have you be wise with them and under them, and follow their
faith, but not their errours; yet this can never be of use to us, till An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
be convicted of an errour by an authority great as her own, or
a reason greater, and declar'd by an authoriz'd Master of Sentences.
But however, be very tender in reproving a Doctrine for which good
men and holy have suffer'd Martyrdom, and of which they have made
publick confession; for nothing reproves a Doctrine so much as to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it abroad with so much scandal and objection: and what reason can
any Schismatick have against the Common Prayer-book, able to weigh
against that argument of blood which for the testimony of it was shed
by the Q. <hi>Mary</hi> Martyrs? I instance the advice in this particular, but
it is true in all things else of the like nature. It was no ill advice who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
gave it to the favourite of a Prince; <hi>Never make your self a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
enemy to the Church; for their interest is so complicated with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and their calling is so dear to God, that one way or other, one time
or other God and man will be their defender.</hi> The same I say concerning
Authority and Antiquity; never do any thing, never say or profess any
thing against it: for besides that if you follow their measures you will
be secur'd in your <hi>faith</hi> and in your <hi>main duty;</hi> even in smaller things,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56643:109"/>
they will be sure to carry the cause against you, and no man is able to
bear the reproach of singularity. It was in honour spoken of S. <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi>
my Predecessor in the See of <hi>D.</hi> in his life written by S. <hi>Bernard;
Apostolicas sanctiones &amp; decreta SS. pp. in cunctis Ecclesiis statuebat.</hi> I
hope to do something of this for your help and service, if God gives
me life and health, and opportunity: But for the present I have done.
These Rules if you observe, your Doctrine will be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, it will

conclude all with the wise saying of <hi>Bensirach;</hi> Extoll not thy self in

you learn from them what you ought to teach, you will give but a very
