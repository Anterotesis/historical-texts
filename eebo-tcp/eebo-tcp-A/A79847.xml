         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEcauſe you accuſe me ſo much of want
of temper, and ſay that I am angry
with you, when I cannot anſwer your
arguments, and ſo that inſteed of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a way to be of one minde, we looſe our
ſelves in paſſion, and love each other worſe than
when we came firſt together: I have taken this
uncholerique way of diſcourſing with you, and
to inform you (ſince you enjoyne me to uſe the
ſame freedome with you, as if you were a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſon) why I am ſo farr from approving
your Declaration of the 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> as an
Act agreeable to any rules of Right and Juſtice,
or an Expedient to promote the Peace and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Publique, that I take it to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the Elements of Law, Equity and
Religion, and even deſtructive to the private
Intereſt of thoſe, for whoſe preſervation it
ſeemes to be intended; And in the doing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I ſhall firſt anſwer your <hi>Argumenta ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem;</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118635:3"/>
thoſe Reaſons by which you thought
to have wrought upon my paſſions and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and to have induced me not to have
found fault with that, which could do no harme
to any body I care for, and which I might
in ſome degree be obliged to defend, in order
to the ſupport of ſomewhat elſe, which I my
ſelf, have done and countenanced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You tell me,</hi> that none are concerned in this
Declaration, or in the moſt rigorous execution of
it, but the Cavaliers, a people towards whoſe
reduction to the low, and wretched condition they
are now in, <hi>you ſay,</hi> no man hath contributed
more than my ſelf, and that I do confeſs my ſelf
to have been much deceived, and to have decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
others, to have been in the wrong, nay, to be
guilty of all the innocent Blood that hath been ſpilt
in this quarrell, if I, as well as you, do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
thoſe people to the utmoſt, upon whom we
have layd all that guilt; and who will ſhew little
favour toward us, if once they grow to have no need
of ours.</p>
            <p>I ſhall have ſo much occaſion, upon ſeverall
parts of your Declaration, to ſpeak of the Caſe
of the Cavaliers, and how neceſſary it is that
Juſtice be obſerved even towards them, and
of the conſequence, and the concernment that
all ſorts of Men have in the adminiſtration of
of that which is right and equitable, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
it is for the Publique, if the due Current of
Law and Juſtice in reſpect of any perſons be
perverted, that I ſhall in this place only put you
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118635:3"/>
in minde of the Inhibition given in the Parable
of the Sowers, to thoſe over-good Husbands,
who would make ſuch haſte to free the Field
from Weeds;<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 29.</note> the Maſter ſaid, <hi>Nay, leaſt whilſt
you gather up the Tares, you root up alſo the Wheat
with them.</hi> There is no man who reads your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
and conſiders it, but diſcerns plainly,
that under pretence of gathering thoſe Tares, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xing
the poor Cavaliers, whom you do not finde
to grow ſo faſt, as much to diſturbe your Corne,
and which you intend at laſt but to gather, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to your ſeverall Appetites and Paſſions of
loving and hating this or that man, or as you
covet their Eſtates, not as they are dangerous
to the publique Peace, you root up the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Wheat, all the Laws and foundations of
Right, which are the onely ſecurity of every
honeſt and free-born Engliſhman; and that in
truth no perſon of the Royall party is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this arbitrary, extravagant and unpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd
Act of Tyranny, than every man, who hath
ſerved the Parliament with the moſt fidelity
throughout that war againſt the late King, if he
do not ſubmit to the preſent Power, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to reforme and ſuppreſſe that, which you
cannot but believe involves a very conſiderable
number of Men, who have deſerved as well of
their Country, and have been and are as great
Aſſertors of the Liberty thereof, as any perſon,
who conſented to the publiſhing that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and therefore it is no wonder if you finde
me, and I ſuppoſe many more, who are not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118635:4"/>
to be over-inclined to the Cavaliers, no
leſs offended at your reſolution and proceedings,
than they have good reaſon to be</p>
            <p>To your tendernes of my reputation, leaſt I
ſuffer in my credit, by differing now with you,
which you ſay <hi>is no leſs than to confeſs that I have
been deceived heretofore, and that I have deceived
others, who were engaged in the quarrell by my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,
or my example,</hi> though I will not anſwer you
in the language of a much wiſer man, even the
excellent <hi>Philip de Comines. That a Prince, or any
other man, who hath never been deceived, can be
but a Beaſt, becauſe he underſtands not the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between good and evill;</hi> yet I may tell you,
that whoſoever hath not been deceived in the
Current of theſe laſt fifteen years, hath been
preſerved from being ſo, by ſuch an abſence of
friendſhip, confidence and Charity in and to
Mankinde, by ſuch a meaſure of diſtruſt, jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
and villany in his Nature, that I had rather
be a Dog than that man: For my ſelf I am not
aſhamed to confeſſe before God and the world,
that I have been much deceived, miſerably, and
wretchedly deceived, but not half ſo much, nor
ſo inexcuſably as I ſhall be, if ever I truſt thoſe
again, who have ſo much deceived me, or if I
believe that my ruine and deſtruction is not as
much deſigned by this Declaration, as any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers
whatſoever; And that I may not hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
trouble you in this diſcourſe concerning my
ſelf, or with my own ſtory, I will very ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
confeſſe to you in this place, my part in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118635:4"/>
the warre that was carried on between the laſt
King and Parliament, and then you will ſee how
like I am to be immoderately inclined to the
Royall party, and yet how unſecure I am from
being buryed in the ſame ruine, that is prepared
to overwhelme them, and conſequently, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I have not reaſon to proteſt and prepare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe, who threaten me with that ruine.</p>
            <p>When I was returned by vertue of the Kings
Writ to ſerve my Country in Parliament, I
brought with me all that affection to the Liberty
and benefit of my Countrey, as the condition
of it required, and all that Reverence and duty
to the King, that was agreeable to the Oaths I &amp;
every man there took, before we could ſit in that
Convention; and truly I had no more deſire to
alter the fundamentall Government of Church
and State, than you have to reſtore it: I will not
deny to you, that after a ſhort time of ſitting
there, the continuall Feaver of the Houſe made
my pulſe beat higher too, and the prejudice I
had to ſome perſons in power, and authority,
from whom, as I thought, I had received ſome
hard meaſure, leſſened my eſteem and opinion
of the Court; Then, the Lords free concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in whatſoever we propoſed, and the Kings
as ready granting whatſoever we deſired, made
me thinke my ſelf in the number of thoſe, who
were to governe all the World, and inſenſibly
I found my ſelf a greater man, than I had before
imagined I was: I choſe the converſation of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118635:5"/>
thoſe who were believed moſt intent and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
to free the ſubject from the vexations and
preſſures he had been made liable to, and I
thought them the moſt competent Judges of the
remedies, which were to be applyed to thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
which they had ſo exactly diſcovered: in a
word I believed all they ſaid, and out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Reverence I had for Parliaments, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
it impoſſible for any thing to flow from
thence, that could bring damage or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to King or People, wherein how much I
have been deceived, the world knows, and I am
not aſhamed to acknowledge: And this opinion
and reſignation of my ſelf to that infallible
Guide, made me neither ſtrictly weigh what
they did, nor patiently hear thoſe Objections,
which I could not anſwer; thinking worſe of the
perſons who objected, than of the things they
objected againſt.</p>
            <p>When the matter of the <hi>Militia</hi> was firſt hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
I had no other underſtanding of it, than as
I had obſerved it had been exerciſed very une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitably
by the Lords Lieutenants and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putyes,
and therefore I hearkened willingly to
thoſe Lawyers, who confidently averr'd, it was
not in the Crown; yet the greateſt reaſon, that
perſwaded me to joyne with thoſe, who would
preſſe the King in it, was, that I thought and
was aſſured, that he who had till then granted all
we asked, would not then begin to deny; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that I ſaw moſt of his Councell and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
who were of both Houſes engaged in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118635:5"/>
ſame party and importunity. When ſo many
Members of both Houſes left the Parliament
and went to the King, I could not deny that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many of them were perſons of great Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
and eminent lovers of their Countrey;
yet I thought their condition ſo deſperate,
that a Serjeant at Armes would have reduced
them all, and was reſolved not to imbarke my
ſelf in ſo hopeleſſe a dependance; the Parliament
being to common underſtanding poſſeſſed of the
whole ſtrength of the Kingdome: Nor had I
ever the leaſt apprehenſion of a Warre, till we
heard that ſome of our Troops were defeated by
<hi>Worceſter;</hi> and that the King began to gather an
Army about <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> which yet I thought
would never have looked ours in the face; but
that the King would upon ſome Treaty have
given my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> leave to have guarded
him to <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and that all, who had obeyed
the Parliament, ſhould have had offices, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and rewards, and this perſwaſion never
departed from me, till we ſaw the Kings Army
drawing down <hi>Edghill</hi> towards us the morning
before that Battell.</p>
            <p>From that time I wiſhed we had been to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
again, and that we had left off to aske, when
the King was reſolved to grant no more; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
three nights after I was quartered neer
<hi>Warwick</hi> at the Houſe of a Miniſter, whom I had
known long before, and who was then fled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reckoned one of the Prelaticall party, and
ſo not taking himſelf to be ſecure among our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118635:6"/>
Troops, which were not eminent for civility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that part of the Clergy; I underſtood he
was hid amongſt his Neighbours, and thereupon
ſent to him to return home, aſſuring him he
ſhould be very ſafe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He came very willingly, and
told me he could not fear the receiving any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
where I commanded, and ſo entertained me
with much cheerfulneſs during the time I ſtayed
there: ſitting with him one evening, I told him,
I believed the loſs of blood on both ſides, had
ſo much allayed all diſtempers, that there would
be no need of drawing more, but that the King
and the Parliament would eaſily come to a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and compoſe all differences, and extinguiſh
all jealouſies, that had been between them. He
ſmiled, and ſaid, he had read a ſtory in <hi>Aelian,</hi>
that when in one of the States of <hi>Greece, Nicip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>
his ſheep brought forth a Lyon, it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and juſtly concluded, that it portended a
Tyranny, and change of the State from a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to a bloody Government, and it fell out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly:
Truly Sir, ſaid he, <hi>when the two
Houſes of Parliament produced a Soveraign power,
to make a Generall, raiſe an Army, and to declare
war, after that milde and innocent Sheepe, that
legall venerable Councell had once brought forth
that Lyon, which ſeeks whom he may devoure, I
gave over all my hopes of the continuance of that
bleſſed, calme and temperate State of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by which every man eat the fruit of his own
vine; and I expect nothing but rapine, blood and
deſolation; and if you have thoſe hopes you mention,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118635:6"/>
you will finde your ſelf diſappointed; and that they,
who you think are of the ſame minde with you,
have nothing leſs in their purpoſes than Peace, or
to perform one promiſe they have made to the
People; but they reſolve to change the whole
frame of Government, and to ſacrifice the wealth
and tranquillity of their Country to their own Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
Covetouſneſs, and Revenge; and when
once they diſcern that you will not purſue their
moſt violent courſes, they will more endeavour
your deſtruction, than of them againſt whom you
are both now ſo unanimouſly engaged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This diſcourſe, which I then conſidered one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as proceeding from the ſpirit of a man, who
I knew approved nothing that we did, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
made impreſſion upon me, and I diſcerned
every day men recede from the grounds they
had before ſeemed to conſent to, and to be leſs
inclined to overtures of Peace, than they had
formerly appeared to have been; yet upon thoſe
ſpecious reaſons; That our onely ſecurity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in keeping ſo much power in our own
hands, that it might not be in the Kings power
to do us hurt; That if we receded from thoſe
Propoſitions, which we had preſſed the King to
grant, we ſhould ſhortly be bereaved of thoſe
good Laws he had already granted; at leaſt, it
would be neceſſary in all Treaties to inſert, and
in ſome degree to inſiſt upon thoſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(how extravagant ſoever) that by departing
from them, we might pretend to pay a valuable
conſideration for thoſe Conceſſions, which we
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118635:7"/>
muſt ſtill require from the King for our own
indemnity; and by theſe means our Treaties
came to nothing, the Treators being never left
at liberty to recede from thoſe unreaſonable
Propoſitions, which were therefore made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
(as was pretended) that they might
be receded from. I will not deny to you, that
when upon the Kings ſucceſſes, Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
were ſent to invite the Scots to our aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and I ſaw a great Army of that Nation
ready to enter the Kingdome upon thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Conditions on our part, that ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to have been ſubmitted to, I was in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity,
that I thought of nothing but caſting
my ſelf at the Kings feet; I was aſhamed, that
having ſo long reproached the King with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of calling over forreign Forces, as if the
affections of his People ſhould fail in any thing
that was juſt for him to attempt; and having
prevailed ſo far upon the People by thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
we our ſelves ſhould call in a forreign
Army to help us, and after we had pretended to
ask nothing of the King but what the People
would not be contented without, and therefore
becauſe the Kingdome generally did deſire and
expect it, that we our ſelves ſhould draw in an
Army of Strangers, of which there could be no
need, if it were not to impoſe that upon the
Kingdome, which it did not deſire: I called to
minde, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſeemed to commend <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi>
for having thought it <hi>leſs diſhonour and
reproach unto the Grecians to be overcome by other
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118635:7"/>
Grecians, than to go ſlatter the barbarous people,
and ſeek to them that had gold and ſilver enough,
but otherwiſe no goodneſs or honeſty.</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
what a coſtly Viſit they had made to us
two years before, and did truly believe, that
what we could ſuffer from one another, could
be nothing to the laſting Calamity they would
bring upon us, who (I was confident) could never
be a means of reſtoring Peace and Happineſs to
the Kingdom. In a word, I thought of nothing
more, than of renouncing thoſe who had ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
renounced their Profeſſions, and of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially
joyning with the King's Party.</p>
            <p>Whil'ſt I was thus reſolved, I heard of the
cold reception they had, who were already gone
to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that the Court there carried it ſelf,
as if it could do its buſineſs without help, and
thought themſelves loſers, by paſſing by any
thing that had been done amiſs. The anger and
indignation I contracted hereupon, made me
change my purpoſe, and to revolve, that if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſhould be of the ſame minde I had been,
and deſert the Parliament, there would be none
left to make reaſonable Conditions for them,
who had been engaged in the Quarrel, which I
perſwaded my ſelf would at ſome time be done.
And I was ſure, that though we might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
our Juriſdiction, and done many unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
things, our being together was ſtill lawfull;
and whil'ſt it was ſo, we ſhould at laſt, upon
good or ill fortune, be Parties to ſuch an
Agreement, as would ſecure our ſelves who
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118635:8"/>
ſtaid, which was more than they could promiſe
themſelves who went away: Hereupon I was
fixed, never more to think of quitting the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
but to run its fortune; and accordingly
I proceeded to the end of the War, and never
left the Houſe, notwithſtanding the ſeveral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Animoſities, and the Violence and
Tumults which I much diſliked, untill I was
with the m<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jor part of the Houſe of Commons,
kept from thence by the Army, and uſed in that
ſcornfull manner, as is notorious enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
after the Treaty at the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
that an Agreement ſhould be made with
the King.</p>
            <p>I have troubled you with this ſhort recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my part in this buſineſs, that you may ſee
how far I have been from favouring Cavaliers,
by whom I have had the honour to be thought
ſo conſiderable, that I was alwayes excepted
from pardon in thoſe Proclamations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,
which then iſſued out. Whil'ſt there
was a War carried on by the Parliament, I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
my life, and loſt my blood in that War;
and whil'ſt there was a Parliament, I continued
in the ſervice of it; and ſince that time, I have
enjoyed my ſelf in as much peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
as the Calamities of the time would ſuffer
me, and without further oppoſing the preſent
power, than in my heart not ſubmitting to it, or
taking it to have any colour of Law, or Juſtice,
or Religion, or Reaſon to ſupport it. And as I
do heartily ask God forgiveneſs for the ill I have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118635:8"/>
been guilty of during the War, ſo I do humbly
thank his Divine Majeſtie for preſerving me
from the guilt of the ill that hath been done
ſince; and I hope the remembrance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
or apprehenſion of any thing that may be
the conſequence of it, ſhall never work upon
me to approve the latter. And ſo I come to your
Declaration it ſelf, the ſeveral parts whereof I
ſhall ſpeak to, without obſerving preciſely the
order they are in, but taking the liberty to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal
them according to my own way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
            <p>Let me then begin with complaining, that
you aſſume to your ſelves throughout the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
the ſtile of the Beſt Affected of the
Nation, of thoſe with whom the Honour and
Intereſt of the Engliſh Nation is depoſited, and
indeed of the Nation it ſelf; and reckon all,
who are not pleaſed with the Government
you have ſo manifeſtly uſurped, Enemies to
the Nation; which you muſt give us leave,
who have ſweat and bled more than any of you,
for the intereſt and liberty of the Nation, and
are ſure a more conſiderable part of it, both in
weight and meaſure, to take very ill of you. We
cannot, we muſt not, endure to have it believed,
that the Engliſh Nation is ſhrunk into my Lord
Protector and his Highneſs Councel, who all
together had not the intereſt of one common
Village when theſe Troubles began; you may
be ſuch a Nation as God threatned his choſen
people withall in <hi>Deuteronomy, A Nation of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118635:9"/>
fierce Countenance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 21. 50.</note> 
               <hi>which ſhall not regard the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the old, nor ſhew favour to the young.</hi> The
Latine Tranſlation renders it, <hi>Gentem impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi>
an inſolent ſort of people, that cared nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for God nor Man. The Grammarians give
the ſtile uſually to Sects, or Profeſſions of Men,
<hi>Natio Philoſophorum, Natio Poetarum;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Jews, the Sect of the Phariſees was
frequently called the Nation of the Phariſees;
you will finde in <hi>Joſephus</hi> a very lively deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of them,<note place="margin">Joſeph, <hi>lib. 17. c.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>who,</hi> he ſayes <hi>were ſo much addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to ſelf opinion, and boaſted themſelves to be
the exacteſt Obſervers of the Law in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to whom the women were very much addicted,
as to thoſe who were much beloved of God, as in
outward appearance they made ſhew to be; Theſe
were ſuch as durſt oppoſe themſelves againſt
Kings, full of fraud, arrogancy and rebellion,
preſuming to raiſe War upon their motions of
ſpirit, and to rebel and offend their Princes at
their pleaſure; and whereas all the Nation of the
Jews had ſworn to be faithfull to</hi> Caeſar, <hi>and to
the Eſtate of the King, thoſe onely refuſed to take
the Oath:</hi> ſo far he. And if you pleaſe this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
you may be, except you chooſe rather (for
you bear great love and affection to the Jews) to
be of their fourth Sect, which the ſame Author
tells you was founded by <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and
accorded in all things with the Phariſees, <hi>but
that they were ſo extreamly zealous for, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of their liberty; that they onely acknowledged
one God to be Lord and Maſter of all things, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118635:9"/>
had rather themſelves, with their deareſt children
and kinsfolk, endure the moſt greivous and bitter
torments that could be imagined, than call any
mortal man their Lord.</hi> And this is the antienteſt
Record, I think, can be produced for thoſe
Friends of yours, who have lifted you up to the
height you are now at, though it is plain your
ſelves are retired enough from thoſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſcruples. Be what other Nation you will,
how far you are from being the Engliſh Nation,
or that part of it which is tender of, and like to
advance its Intereſts, muſt appear in the further
examination of the Principles of your Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Since you would have it believed, that no part
of the Engliſh Nation can be concerned in, or
hurt by this deſtroying Act, but onely the Royal
Party; you ſhould ſo clearly have ſet down the
guilt of thoſe you puniſh, and the rules by which
you puniſh, that no innocent man could have
thought himſelf involved in the one, or in the
reach of the other: it had been to be wiſhed, that
ſince you take upon you to execute Juſtice and
Judgement for the Nation, you had, according
to the good old Cuſtome alwayes obſerved in
thoſe Judicatories, plainly ſet out the known
Laws of the Land, by which ſuch and ſuch
Actions are declared to be Crimes, and by which
thoſe Crimes are to be puniſhed in that degree;
it being no more in the Judges power to exceed
the puniſhment preſcribed, than to declare that
to be a Crime, which no Law hath declared to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118635:10"/>
be ſo: whereas without quoting one judged
Caſe in Law, or citing one Statute for your
ground, or mentioning one precedent to juſtifie
your manner of proceeding, you wrap up your
diſcourſe in Metaphyſical notions, and conclude
by deductions from the Law, and Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and from the dictates of Reaſon; a Reaſon
ſo abſtracted from practice, and ſo difficult to
be underſtood, that we may well apprehend,
that we ſhall hereafter be concluded guilty, and
condemned, before we are accuſed, or able to
accuſe our ſelves; and therefore it is not out of
kindneſs to them, that we now endeavour to
ſtate the true Caſe of the Royal Party, the
Crime they are charged with in this Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Judgement that is inflicted upon them,
and the Grounds of that Judgement, that we
may from thence be able to conclude, how far
we are from their caſe, and conſequently how
ſecure we are from being liable to their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The Caſe then of the Royal Party is this.
After a War waged for ſome years between the
King and the Parliament, after ſeveral great
Succeſſes on the Parliaments ſide, the Kings
Armies and Garriſons are reduced to thoſe
ſtreights, that they thought fit to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
They do not confeſs that they owe
their admiſſion to compound for their Eſtates,
or the moderation that was uſed in it, to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of good nature you reproach them with in
your Declaration. But they ſay it was upon a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118635:10"/>
full Contract between the Parliament and them,
and upon Articles of ſurrender on their part of
thoſe places of ſtrength which remained then in
their poſſeſſion; the which, together with their
acquieſcence from further oppoſing us, we of
the Parliaments party (they ſay) then thought a
valuable conſideration for any Conceſſions we
then made to them; and that they had the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith of the Parliament for the punctual and
exact performance of the Articles on our part.
That by our thus treating with them, and their
compounding with us, we raiſed a vaſt ſum of
money for the ſupport of our Armies, without
which we had been in many ſtreights; and if
they had not totally declined any further
thoughts of oppoſing us, amongſt ſo many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
which then raged in the Parliament,
the Army, and amongſt the Scots, it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that we ſhould have carried all before us
with ſo little reſiſtance as we did; ſo that the
advantage we got by their Compounding, was
not ſmall or inconſiderable. That we were ſo
far from requiring them to change their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
(other than their no further aſſiſting the
King in a War againſt the Parliament, the
which himſelf at the ſame time declined, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
himſelf to Treaties) that there was a ſpecial
proviſion in all Articles againſt any ſuch preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
That we of the Parliaments party were
ſo far from urging them to wave their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to the King, that we profeſſed the ſame
with them in all our Profeſſions, Declarations,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118635:11"/>
and Proteſtations; and that the Crime we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
them of, and obliged them to compound
for, was, for their offences againſt the King and
Parliament, and therefore the Pardon drawn by
order of Parliament, was granted to them in the
Kings name, and paſſed under the Great Seal of
<hi>England:</hi> ſo that they were, and are by that (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Fundamental Laws of <hi>England,</hi>
which are the onely ſecurity every Subject hath
for the enjoying his property and his liberty)
free and abſolved from all manner of Offences
committed before the Grant of that Pardon;
and by it put into as full a poſſeſſion of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
and all the Rights of a Subject of <hi>England,</hi>
as they before enjoyed; and if they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
no offence ſince that time againſt the
Laws of the Land, they are, and ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
in the ſame condition with us, and not
in any degree to be troubled for more than what
they have done ſince. And this is in truth the
ſtate of the Royal Party, without ſtrengthening
it by any conſideration of the Act of <hi>Grace</hi> and
<hi>Oblivion,</hi> which was afterwards granted to
them.</p>
            <p>Whether thoſe Articles have been ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
performed as you ſay; whether that
Court, which was purpoſely erected to do them
Juſtice in that particular, was erected ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and before they were broken with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
oppreſſion; or whether that Court
hath ſince executed Juſtice ſo effectually on their
behalf, as you declare, I leave to themſelves to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118635:11"/>
make manifeſt; being in truth (as I ſaid before)
no otherwiſe concerned for them, than as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
adminiſtration of Juſtice to all ſorts of
people, is, and muſt be, the foundation of peace
and happineſs to any Commonwealth, according
to the Ordinance of God himſelf,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23. 3.</note> 
               <hi>He that ruleth
over men, muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God.</hi>
Where there is not exact and preciſe Juſtice,
there can be no fear of God, pretend what you
will; and you cannot but have heard, that very
many learned and pious men have attributed the
ill ſucceſs which the Chriſtians received in the
ſeveral attempts which have been made, with ſo
vaſt a conſumpſion of men and treaſure in the
<hi>Holy Land,</hi> to that perfidious breach of faith
made by the Chriſtians, after the firſt taking of
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the year 1098. when after Mercy
proclaimed to all that would lay down Arms, it
was concluded neceſſary for their defence) upon
the rumour or apprehenſion of the approach of
a new Enemy, and the number of the Captives
being very great) to put all the Turks to the
Sword, which was performed accordingly,
without favour to age or ſex, three dayes after
their promiſe made, to the infinite reproach of
Chriſtian Religion; <hi>though</hi> (as my Author ſayes)
<hi>ſome ſlew them with the ſame zeal that</hi> Saul <hi>ſlew
the Gibeonites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Full.</hi> Ho, War, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> 41.</note> 
               <hi>and thought it unfit that thoſe goats
ſhould live in the ſheeps paſture.</hi> But the noble
<hi>Tancred</hi> was highly diſpleaſed at it, and knew
that Chriſtianity abhorred any ſuch violation of
Contract, and expected the miſerable ſucceſs
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118635:12"/>
that attended it. And it may be, that unjuſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
might be one of the reaſons that moved
our <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> to refuſe that Crown
which was then offered him, and afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
on <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloigne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have ſet down the ſtate and ſecurity they
were in by that Agreement and Pardon; let us in
the next place examin how they become Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
&amp; fallen from that ſtate of Grace, and what
the Crimes are which you now object to them.
Before you opening the Deſign, you prepare us
to be content with very ſlender Evidence, by
telling us, that Conſpirators are a ſly and ſecret
generation of men, whoſe walks are ever in the
dark, and the meaſure of all their feet cannot be
exactly taken and compared. Truly if they walk
ſo much in the dark, that they cannot be found
out to be tryed, they ought not to be found out
to be executed: yet in the very Preliminaries to
the Conſpiracy, you charge them with matters
as evident and manifeſtable in their nature, as
any part of a Conſpiracy can be. That perſons
were ſent from hence to <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> with
Letters of Credit, and a conſiderable ſum of
money. That a ſelect number of perſons were
choſen by the name of a Sealed Knot, who
were to reſide about <hi>London,</hi> and to keep and
maintain correſpondence with thoſe of their
party beyond Sea; both which are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
if true, as eaſy to be made appear to be,
as levying of War, or any other act of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
You have Ordinances ſevere enough
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118635:12"/>
againſt thoſe, who ſend money to <hi>Charles Stuart;</hi>
or thoſe, who correſpond with them; produce
the perſons, make good the Charge, and we ſhall
not thinke our ſelves in danger by your ſentence
upon them; but, if you will infer, that becauſe
he is not ſtarved abroad, he is ſupported from
hence: and that all, who do not wiſh you your
hearts deſire, conſpire to promote his intereſt, we
muſt not conſent to ſuch conſequences, in which
we are no leſſe involved, than they.</p>
            <p>You ſpeake of one <hi>Fitz-James,</hi> who went
from hence to the late Kings eldeſt ſon, then at
<hi>Paris</hi> to promote ſome deſigne of Aſſaſſination
of particular perſons; of a Conjunction between
him and <hi>John Gerard;</hi> of Major <hi>Henſhaws</hi> going
to <hi>Paris</hi> concerning the ſame deſigne, and that
<hi>Charles Stuart</hi> refuſed to ſee him, but relyed on
<hi>Gerard</hi> and <hi>Fitz-James,</hi> to whom he gave pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
directions, that they ſhould not make their
attempt, till all his friends were ready in <hi>England:</hi>
Then you ſay, there was one <hi>Boſwell,</hi> and alſo
one <hi>Pierce,</hi> and ſeverall other perſons imployed
at other times for thoſe Aſſaſſinations, and had
laid the place and manner of execution; and the
meanes whereby to attempt it; <hi>All the particulars
whereof</hi> (you ſay) <hi>would be too large to ſet down;
as it would the ſeverall gratious Providences of
God in the diſappointing of them.</hi> Truly, if this
ſhort Recollection of ſuch important particulars
be only to put you in minde in your devotions,
to acknowledge to that Providence, thoſe ſignall
deliverances, you may be as reſerved in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118635:13"/>
as you pleaſe; but if you deſire to engage
us in the belief that ſuch attempts have been reall,
and in a deteſtation of the Abettors of them, you
ought to enlarge your ſelves in the relation,
and to publiſh ſuch evidence as may ſatisfy the
world, that your deliverances have been more
than from your owne imaginations. What the
other perſons are you mention, I meet with no
body that knows; and for <hi>Fitz-James,</hi> I hear
all thoſe of the Royall party, who upon the
publiſhing this Declaration have occaſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough
to ſpeake of him, ſay, that they alwayes
looked upon him, as a Spy of yours, and not of
their party; and you may remember, when you
and I were once walking in <hi>James's</hi> Parke, and
he paſſing by, I asked you who he was, you told
me that you hoped by the meanes of that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that <hi>Dunkirke</hi> would be ſhortly put into
your hands, it being then in the hands of the
<hi>French;</hi> and that he was newly returned from
thence, with ſome aſſurance to that purpoſe;
how he came ſo ſoone after to be ſo dangerous
an Enemy to you, and ſo much truſted by your
enemies, I cannot imagine, and had need to
be made manifeſt by ſome authentique teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>You proceede in hudling up another Deſigne,
<hi>of working upon diſcontented humors, which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to be ſtirring in the Nation upon pretences
of liberty, and the Rights of the free-borne people
of England, which were ſuppoſed to be infringed
by keeping up an Army, and by enforcing taxes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118635:13"/>
from them, and by not calling free &amp; equall Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives,
choſen by all the people;</hi> and then you
accuſe <hi>John Wildeman</hi> and ſome others of the
like Principles (whom you do not name) as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Inſtruments for managing that part of cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for liberty: And theſe you ſay, were to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on a deſigne, <hi>which ſhould in outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
be different from the other, although in truth
it came from the ſame root, and was directed to
the ſame end.</hi> And you ſay <hi>John Wildeman</hi> had
brought his part to ſuch maturity, that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
very little, but the open declaring himſelf in
armes, <hi>having in effect finiſhed his declaration,</hi>
which was to be publiſhed upon that occaſion,
and the time you ſay did fully anſwer the Riſing
deſigned by the Royall party, which fell out
but a few dayes after: When you ſay, there was
another Inſurrection that was to keep company
with this, and that part of your Army in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ſhould have mutined, ſurprized their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
thrown off their Officers, and marched
up to <hi>London</hi> under the command of <hi>Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Overton:</hi> Whereas you forget, that no
longer ago, than in page 15<hi rend="sup">t•</hi> of your Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
you ſay it was the principall buſineſs of
thoſe, who were ſent with letters of credit and
a conſiderable ſumme of money, to aſſure
<hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> that the reaſon why the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Gentry, and bulke of the Kingdom of
<hi>England,</hi> (which they ſaid were Epiſcopall, and
of his former party,) did not riſe with him upon
his late March from <hi>Scotland,</hi> was, <hi>becauſe he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118635:14"/>
was believed to have gone upon grounds diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
both to their affections and intereſts, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to the good of the Nation, and inconſiſtent with
the ancient Conſtitutions both of Church and State;
but that if he would return to his former Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
to wit, To caſt himſelf totally upon his old
party, they would venture both their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
for his recovery.</hi> And in page 27. after the
affaires grew apace into a ripenes, and ſome were
of opinion, that they ſhould take in ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who had been for the Parliament, you ſay,
<hi>It was denyed upon this reaſon, that ſeeing they had
no need of them, as their affaires then ſtood, it
would be prejudiciall to his Majeſties ſervice, and
their common intereſt, to take in perſons, whom
they ſhould afterwards be troubled to be rid of.</hi>
How comes it then to paſſe, that this ſevere
Royall party, without regard to their principles,
on a ſuddaine ſhould incorporate it ſelf with
<hi>John Wildeman,</hi> and Major Generall <hi>Overton,</hi>
who in their ſeverall Stations, have moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
that intereſt, which is moſt deſtructive
to theirs; and who have never been ſuſpected for
inclination to Epiſcopacy; and your ſelves tell
us, after you have amuſed us with the diſcourſe
of <hi>John Wildeman,</hi> and Major Generall <hi>Overton,
that thoſe, that were to be made uſe of to bring the
deſigne to paſs, were the Revellers, who did not, as
you hope, intend to ſerve the intereſt of Charles
Stuart.</hi> What the merit of thoſe two perſons hath
been towards the Commonwealth, is enough
known to all lovers of their Countrey; nor can
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118635:14"/>
their reputation be blaſted by ſuch obſcure inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations.
It is now many moneths ſince they
have been in your hands, under a very ſtrict re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
and if you could prove any thing againſt
them of adhering to the Royall party, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
that intereſt, you would have uſed the
ſame expedition in proceeding againſt them, as
you have done againſt thoſe at <hi>Salisbury</hi> and
<hi>Exeter,</hi> and therefore we have reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that their being ſo honeſtly concerned for
the Liberty and Rights of the Free-born people
of <hi>England;</hi> their ſuppoſing it <hi>to be infringed by
keeping up an Army, and by enforcing Taxes from
them, and by not calling a free and equall Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
choſen by all the people,</hi> is their Crime
and Guilt, and if you caſt in all thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are
of the ſame opinion with them, into the Royall
party, and think to make them odious, under
that imputation, you will indeed make a party
ſtrong enough to vindicate a very Royall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and intereſt.</p>
            <p>The cleer matter of fact, which ſeemes to have
ſome manifeſtation, is this, That ſome perſons
have been particularly truſted in this Kingdom
by <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> to diſpoſe the people to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
riſing, to provide money, to buy Armes
and Munition; and if they could to ſurprize ſome
Sea town; That he himſelf was ſo pleaſed to
hear how carefull and ſolicitous they were for
him, that though out of the tendernes he had for
his friends, he had deferr'd to call upon them,
till he could give them encouragement from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118635:15"/>
yet ſince that came on ſo lowly, he would
no longer reſtrain their affections; but if they
were able to make any handſome appearance in
any one place, he would be ſure himſelf with
them, and ſent them word, that he would to
that purpoſe keep himſelf within a reaſonable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
and this letter was writ in <hi>July</hi> 1654.
neer eight moneths before appearance of trouble.
After this, to make good his promiſe, he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himſelf from <hi>Cologne</hi> into <hi>Zealand,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to attend the riſing, and the Lord <hi>Wilmot,
Wagſtaff</hi> and <hi>Oneile</hi> came over actually to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and lead the deſign, and agreed to make
their attempt upon the twelve of <hi>March</hi> 1654.
An Inſurrection accordingly was made in the
Weſt, and had in all probability encreaſed, if it
had not been ſeaſonably ſuppreſſed: That in
<hi>Yorkſhire</hi> ſeparated, as ſoone or before they
came together, and ſo in all other places, and
thus by the goodneſs of God that bloody de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was prevented; yet (you ſay) <hi>ſome who
run away from their Rendezvous, did it with
a reſolution to take a better opportunity, when
the Government in confidence of the preſent ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
ſhall be ſecure, and leſſe aware of them, and
they are at this day at worke upon other deſignes
both here and in</hi> Scotland, <hi>to begin new troubles
and rebellions amongſt us;</hi> And this is the Charge
of what they have done.</p>
            <p>Let us now ſee the inferences that are drawn
from hence, and the judgement that is given
thereupon, and it will be then eaſily diſcerned,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118635:15"/>
whether we, (who are not accuſed of the guilt,
for you ſay the deſigne was generall, and level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
againſt all thoſe, who had upon any account
whatſoever adhered to, and owned this Cauſe)
are not by thoſe inferences to be made lyable to
the ſame judgement, when ever you conclude it
convenient to your affaires that we undergo it.
You inferre from your own Narration (the truth
whereof I have nothing to do to queſtion) that
their pretended King, who was ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque
for <hi>England,</hi> would never have put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the eye and face of the world, if thoſe,
who ſhewed themſelves in armes, were to have
no other ſeconds but what appeared; and you
ſay, it cannot be imagined, that the Lord <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot</hi>
and <hi>Wagſtaf,</hi> and others, would have run ſo
great hazards upon ſo weak grounds; Or that
thoſe Gentlemen who did actually riſe, could
ſuppoſe that the Army would be ſo eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run,
and therefore you conclude, that what was
done by them, proceeded from the conſent of
the whole party, and upon this aſſumption, you
adjudge their libertyes and their fortunes to be
at your mercy; and that all the pardons and
Acts of Indempnity, which have been paſſed on
their behalf, are void; and rather aggravations of
their guilt, than ſecurity againſt any other judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you will hereafter paſſe againſt, or upon
them.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible, that you can ſatisfy your own
Conſciences with this kinde of argumentations
or can you believe your Army ſtrong enough to

            <p>Than to imagine that you could compoſe their
minds with this Declaration; Can you think
it a good Argument, that the whole party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to riſe, and ſo ground enough to judge
them, becauſe their pretended King, the Lord
<hi>Wilmot</hi> and ſome others believed they would?
and do you not rather think their not riſing,
when if they had, they might have given us
all trouble, an argument that they never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it? You ſay, that the firſt of the three things
which were chiefly deſigned by them in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
was, <hi>To prepare and engage every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall
man of their own party, who had either
been in the former Warrs, or had been a friend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, or was likely by reaſon of his alliance,
breeding, or diſcontents, to engage therein, who
being engaged, were to bring all their Tenants,
and thoſe who depended upon them: and alſo to lay
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118635:16"/>
deſignes for the poſſeſſing of Garriſons and ſtrong
Holds.</hi> And is it not very manifeſt by no one
mans appearing with all his Tenants, and very
few mens appearing who had Tenants, by their
not poſſeſſing one Garriſon, or ſtrong hold, or
houſe, that what deſign ſoever ſome particular
perſons might have, the whole party did in no
degree cheriſh or aſſiſt the deſign? Shall the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of thoſe who were there, though many
probably might not know what they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
be enough to condemn them, and ſhall not
the abſence of others, except you can prove they
were at leaſt privy to what was deſigned, abſolve
them? You ſay, that what <hi>Major Generall Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
deſigned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> 
               <hi>was to be brought to paſſe by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
and ſome others, who did not (as you hope)
intend to ſerve the intereſt of Charles Stuart.</hi> And
why have you not ſo much Charity for the
Royall party, of which there did not appeare
enough at any Rendezvous <hi>(Salisbury</hi> onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
to put you to the trouble of diſperſing
them, to hope that whatever the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi>
and the reſt intended, to bring to paſſe by them,
they never thought to ſecond them? It can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be juſt in it ſelf, nor prudent in you, to give
the Royall Party cauſe to believe, that they hold
their liberties and Eſtates by no better a tenure,
than the good behaviour of every man who
keeps them company, or hath been heretofore
engaged in the ſame quarrell with them; That
the Earl of <hi>Kingſton,</hi> who therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
becauſe he had a great eſtate to enjoy,
ſhould looſe his, when ever Major Generall <hi>Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaffe</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:118635:17"/>
ſhall rebell againſt you, who never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
becauſe he had nothing to ſave, and
will be alwayes venturing, becauſe he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to looſe. You have not reduced the Royall
party into a Corporation, that by the miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
of ſome of the Members, their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhould be avoided: They of them, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had pardon, have received no benefit by
what the other procured for themſelves, and
there is no reaſon they who compounded with
you, ſhould without committing new faults,
receive prejudice by the tranſgreſſions of other
men. Can you imagine, that they who were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by you to compound, would ever have
been at the charge and trouble of it, if they had
thought they ſhould incurre any danger, or pay
the penalty, for any attempts made by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
Perſons? As long as they, who are not
ſuffered to live amongſt you, are projecting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you (as they will alwayes be) muſt not the
reſt, who dwell at home as much as you,
enjoy what is their own? In a word, every man
compounded for himſelf, ſued out his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and can only be puniſhed for his own of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences:
And it is expreſly provided for by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Statutes of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that no man ſhall
be condemned without being brought to his
anſwer, and how the ſworne Judges of the Law,
who do not relieve thoſe, who demand prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from them for their Liberties or Eſtates,
will anſwer the breach of their duty and their
Oaths I cannot foreſee; eſpecially, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
what the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Cooke</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:118635:17"/>

in the firſt year of H. 4. that the Lords, nor
the Judges ſhall never be admitted to ſay, That
they durſt not for fear of death to ſpeak the truth.</hi>
For my own part, I am content, that I was one
of that partie, which reduced them to a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of compounding, and admitted them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
upon ſuch terms, that they might enjoy
their Countrey with ſome ſatisfaction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
Let it be your glory, to breake and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

thoſe were by the excellent Hiſtorian, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination

            <p>I come now to conſider, how we, who are not
yet accuſed by you, may expect upon the ſame
inferences, to have the ſame judgement let looſe
upon us, which for the preſent you intend ſhall
immediatly deſtroy only the Royall partie: you
will not ſuffer us to think it ſtrange, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
perſons are ſecured, although they were not
viſibly in armes, upon the late Inſurrection, or
that you have laid a burthen upon their Eſtates,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118635:18"/>
beyond what is impoſed upon the reſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
towards the defraying that charge, of which
they are the occaſion: you have at preſent in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie
under the ſame generall reproach perſons,
who from the beginning to the end of the warr,
ſerved the Parliament as faithfully and as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently,
as any who were Members of it: now it
is not probable, that they would have engaged
themſelves in ſo unequall an enterprize, if they
had not expected to be ſeconded by their friends,
why ſhould not we therfore looke to be involved
under the ſame judgment? You ſay, <hi>John Wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and others of the like Principles, were moſt
fitting Inſtruments for the carrying on the deſign,
and that Major Generall Overton was to make uſe
of the Levellers, and it cannot be ſuppoſed, that
they would have proceeded ſo far, without having
ſome aſſurance of aſſiſtance from their party,</hi> and I
pray then where is the difference between the
Levellers, thoſe who inſiſt upon the Rights and
Liberties of the free-borne people of <hi>England,</hi>
who would have Taxes taken off, and a free and
equall Repreſentative (thoſe are their Crimes)
and the Royall partie which is condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome of their friends appeared in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection?
It is plaine enough, what <hi>they</hi> are
in due time to expect at your hands, who in the
laſt Parliament <hi>Inſiſted to have part of the Army
disbanded,</hi> which you inſinuate, was done upon
no leſſe than Combination with that partie you
have condemned: But we need not take ſuch
paines by ſuch inferences to diſcover your good
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118635:18"/>
purpoſes towards us,<note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> you have ingenuouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
That your quarrell is againſt all, who
retaine their old Principles, and ſtill adhere to
their former intereſt in direct oppoſition to the
Government eſtabliſhed: Let the old Principles
retained, be what they will, and the Intereſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to what it will, Parliamentarie Principles
and Parliamentarie Intereſt, Presbyterian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Presbyterian Intereſt, Independent
Principles and Independent Intereſt, if it be in
direct oppoſition to the Government eſtabliſhed,
the ſame meaſure of perſecution muſt be their
portion, which you would have us thinke is
only now aſſigned to the Cavaliers. Alas it is
not their Principles you are angry with, but their
obſtinate adhering to their obligations, and their
intereſt; Let them depart from thoſe, and no
longer oppoſe the Government eſtabliſhed, and
you will like them the better for their Principles:
the truth is, you thinke none worthy of their
eſtates, but they who have their Principles, and
therefore you reſolve to take both Eſtates and
Principles to your ſelves: No other Principles
will ſerve your turne, witneſs the weekly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
preached by your Proſelytes, of obedience,
and ſubjection to Government; ſo diametrically
contrary to what the ſame men preached in the
beginning of theſe troubles, that if their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of the year 1641. were bound up in the
ſame volume with thoſe they preached in 1654
and 1655, they might be taken to be <hi>Vincent</hi> and

begotten by the ſame Parents; witneſs the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Grounds of this Declaration and
Judgement, which are more arbitrary and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
than ever were vented or laid down,
and owned by the moſt exorbitant perſon of the
Royal Party, which pulls up all Property and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
by the roots, reduces all our Law, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and Statute, to the dictates of your own
will, and all reaſon to that which you, and you
alone, will call reaſon of State, and which we
are obliged in the next place to examine, as our
<hi>Parva Charta,</hi> and the Funeral Oration upon
Parliaments, Law, Conſcience, and Equity, and
we ſhall then ſee how near our condition is to
that of the poor <hi>Sicilians,</hi> which <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us
of, when the two Captains, <hi>Calippus</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax,</hi>
profeſſed they would ſet <hi>Sicily</hi> at liberty,
and drive out the Tyrants, but did in truth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
ſo much cruelty upon the people, and
brought them to ſuch calamity and miſery, that
(he ſayes) <hi>all that they had ever ſuffered under all
the Tyrants,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plut. vitâ Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mol.</note> 
               <hi>ſeemed to be pleaſure and delight, to
the inſupportable yoke of ſervitude they were forced
to ſubmit to under thoſe Reformers; and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
nothing more, than to exchange the liberty
they had ſo dearly purchaſed, for the Government
they had ſo fooliſhly wiſhed to be freed from.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your firſt Principle is, <hi>That as well the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of War, as the favour and grace granted by
the Act of Oblivion, contained in them a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118635:19"/>
As there did a real benefit accrew to the
Grantees, ſo certainly there was a good intended
and deſigned by them to the State; and if the
State do not attain their end, neither ought the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to accompliſh theirs:</hi> From hence you argue,
<hi>That none have ſigned to Articles of War, that are
not conditional; and that when thoſe, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thoſe Articles, reſolved to break the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
they had not then the conſent of thoſe that
gave them.</hi> Let us ſpeak firſt to the Articles of
War; and if you had not a wonderfull delight
to make eaſy things hard, and to perplex the
common people with difficult words, you could
not apply this diſcourſe to your purpoſe: Nor
do Articles of War contain any ſecret Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are not expreſſed. The reciprocation is,
that one delivers what he is in expreſs tearms ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to deliver, and thereupon that he receives
what was promiſed that he ſhould receive; if
he performs not his promiſe at the time he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
or imbezel any thing he promiſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,
he hath forfeited the benefit that ſhould
accrew to him by the Articles. But when he
hath performed his part (I ſpeak purely of the
Articles of War) he is not obliged to change his
Party, nor to love thoſe with whom he hath ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulated,
nor ſhall forfeit the benefit due to him
by thoſe Articles, though he ſhould ſeize the
Town delivered by him within one month after,
except he were by his Articles expreſly reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from any ſuch attempt.</p>
            <p>For the Act of Oblivion, you declare, <hi>That
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118635:20"/>
muſt needs be meant as an Obligation upon the
Enemy, and as a proper means to take away the
Enmity contracted by the War, intending by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to reform thoſe who had oppoſed, &amp;c. And that
this doth imply ſuch a condition in the nature of it.</hi>
Whereas in truth any Condition is contrary to,
very inconſiſtent with the nature of it; nothing
more abſolute, nothing leſs conditional, than an
Act of Oblivion, which wipes out all that is
paſt, without the leaſt proſpect to come. Nor
are they alwayes granted out of mercy, but from
conveniency, when they who give them uſually
receive as much benefit from them, as they to
whom they are granted; when the number or
power of the guilty is too great and too hard for
the innocent, the latter are more concerned to
give, than the other to receive the Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion,
in which of old there uſed to be this
Clauſe,<note place="margin">Liv. li. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Ne quis eam rem</hi> (whatſoever it was
they had been guilty of) <hi>joco ſeriove cuiquam
exprobraret;</hi> which if it were an eſſential Clauſe,
hath been very ill obſerved by you.</p>
            <p>You heighten this Doctrine by a very notable
Maxim, in the point of Pardons, which you ſay
are alwayes granted with Clauſes of good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
either <hi>explicit</hi> or <hi>implicit, becauſe elſe
whoſoever granted them, lets looſe a Delinquent
to future offence; and he that anſwers not the end
and conſideration of the Pardon, cannot in reaſon
be ſaid ever to accept it; For,</hi> you ſay, <hi>an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion
was not onely intended of the offences,
whereby they had rendred themſelves obnoxious,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118635:20"/>
but that this kindneſs ſhould be anſwered with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
on their part, and produce a real change in
their Principles and Intereſt, as to the Common
Cauſe.</hi> I have heard, that it is uſual that men,
who plead their pardon for any capital offence,
are obliged to finde Sureties for their good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour:
but I never heard, that for the breach
of the good behaviour, they were proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
and executed for their old offence, as if
they had no pardon, that is ſure againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Pardon. Nay, if a man be pardoned
under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> for the higheſt
Treaſon, and afterwards commit a new Treaſon,
he ſhall not, without a new Proceſs, be executed
for the old, but muſt be formally convicted for
the new, and can be puniſhed onely for that;
nor can the former be any other aggravation,
than to make him appear leſs worthy of a new
mercy. But let us ſee now how far this new
Law, and new Logick, concerns our ſelves; and
firſt, give me leave to put you a Caſe, which
may or might have much concerned one of your
own Body; and we finde thoſe inſtances illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
moſt, which come neareſt to our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
My Lord Commiſſioner <hi>Fynes</hi> (who
they ſay was the ſole Architect of this goodly
Structure, your Declaration) was, you know,
once Governour of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and for the baſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring
that City to the late King's Forces,
out of want of Courage to defend, was adjudged
by a Court of War at Saint <hi>Albans,</hi> to loſe his
head; my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> according to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118635:21"/>
he then had, gave him his pardon under
his hand and ſeal, by which alone he was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from Execution. Now the intention of
that Pardon was, that <hi>this kindneſs ſhould be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
with obedience on his part, and that he
ſhould not ſwerve from the Principles of that
Cauſe then in conteſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor from his affection to that
General, who gave him his life.</hi> How far he hath
been from performing thoſe Conditions, all the
World knows, and yet he would not ſure be
willing to forfeit the benefit of his Pardon.
Another intention of that Pardon, was, that he
ſhould have Courage and Magnanimity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
any Truſt the State ſhould confer upon
him, without being corrupted with fear or hope,
to betray it: If he ſhall by money or threats be
wrought upon to do injuſtice in the place in
which he is truſted, ſince <hi>he that anſwers not the
end and conſideration of the Pardon, cannot in
reaſon be ſaid ever to accept it,</hi> ſhall he forfeit the
benefit thereof, and loſe his head upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Judgement? Have you forgotten how many
perſons ſtand ſecured by your Act of Oblivion
and Pardon, beſides the Royal Party? and will
you, that you may elude the one, lay down thoſe
rules, which muſt cancel the peace and quiet of
the other? What have many faithfull people
of the City, and other good Patriots, to ſecure
them for many things they did during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
between and in the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and whil'ſt one part went to the Army,
and the other remained in their places, but Acts
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118635:21"/>
of Oblivion and Pardon? What have the Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
of the Army, and indeed thoſe parts of
the Army it ſelf, not inconſiderable, who upon
ſeveral occaſions refuſed to obey their orders,
and ſometimes mutined againſt their Officers, to
ſecure them that they ſhould not loſe their
heads to morrow, but Acts of Oblivion and
Pardon? And muſt they now be told of inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in granting them, which they never heard
of? And that if the State do not attain their end,
in ſuch an obedience on their part, as produces
a real change in their principles and intereſt, <hi>all
is voyd that hath been done, and they liable to the
ſame puniſhment, as if no ſuch Acts had paſſed?</hi>
If this be their Caſe, they had need provide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſecurity for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Your next Principle is worthy of your ſelves,
and a fit Corner-ſtone for your foundation of
Tyrannie, That <hi>forbearance from outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will not avail nor entitle to the benefit of the
Pardon, if yet there be malice and revenge in the
heart, and ſuch a leaning and adhering to the old
intereſt, that nothing is wanting for the diſcovery
thereof, but a fitting opportunity; for</hi> (you ſay)
<hi>as ſuch men cannot in juſtice and ingenuity claim
the benefit of an Act of Favour from that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Magiſtrate, to whom they know themſelves
to be Enemies: ſo neither is that Magiſtrate
bound in juſtice before God or Men to give it to
them, if he hath reaſon to believe from the courſe
of their converſations, that they are ſuch, and that
their intentions towards the Government, under
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118635:22"/>
which they live, are the ſame as when they were in
open Arms againſt it, and is at liberty to carry
himſelf towards them, as if no ſuch act had been;
nay, he may proceed againſt them with greater ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
&amp;c.</hi> Truly if this be ſo, the large bulk of
our Laws and Records, which eſtabliſh our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and our property, may be reduced into a
very ſmall Volume; and we are ſo much the
worſe for the Reformation you have wrought,
that we have not onely fought away our Arms,
but all thoſe Rights for which we took them up.
And if after all our clamour againſt Oaths <hi>ex
officio,</hi> and mens being compelled to accuſe
themſelves, againſt the Star-Chamber, and the
High-Commiſſion, we are now to be undone for
the thoughts of our heart, and our intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Government, and that you will take
upon you to know thoſe thoughts and intentions,
and that not from any thing we know or do our
ſelves, but from the courſe of our converſation,
which may be from what others ſay or do, with
whom we converſe; it is more than time for us
either to ſeek ſecurity in ſome other Climate,
where this Day of Judgement is not yet come to
paſs, or ſo to purge our own, that we may be
out of the danger of thoſe, who with impious
preſumption take upon them to do that office,
and make that inquiſition into the hearts of men,
which God Almighty hath reſerved for himſelf,
and who will then proceed with leſs rigour upon
what he knows, than theſe terrible Inquiſitors
do, upon what they unreaſonably ſay they have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118635:22"/>
reaſon to believe. Let us revolve the vaſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
we have loſt, and compare it with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
we poſſeſs. The Law ſayes, no man ſhall
be puniſhed, if his offence be not proved by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Witneſſes; this Declaration ſayes, though
we abſtain from any unlawfull action, we ſhall
be puniſhed for the malice and revenge in our
heart.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cooks</hi> Pleas of the Crown, <hi>fol.</hi> 9.</note> The Law ſayes, that a Conſpiracy to levy
War, is no Treaſon, except there be a levying
of War <hi>in facto;</hi> your Declaration ſayes, If
you have reaſon to believe that we have evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
againſt the Government, we are without
any right or title to any thing we enjoy, and are
at your mercy to diſpoſe of us as you pleaſe;
which is the loweſt condition of Traitors. If
this be Liberty, what Nation in <hi>Europe</hi> lives in
Servitude?</p>
            <p>I have been longer than I meant to have been,
and therefore I ſhall onely mention one more of
your Principles; which if <hi>Machiavel's Prince,
Hob's Leviathan,</hi> and all other Inſtitutions of
Tyrannie were loſt, would be ſufficient to avoyd
all eſtabliſhed Laws, and inſenſibly to bring the
freeſt People into the moſt inſupportable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and to reſolve all Obligations of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into the good will and pleaſure of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.
That <hi>if the Supream Magiſtrate were
in theſe Caſes tyed up to the ordinary rules, and
had not a liberty to proceed upon illuſtrations of
reaſon, againſt thoſe who are continually ſuſpected,
there would be wanting in ſuch a State the means
of common ſafety.</hi> The illuſtration of Reaſon is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118635:23"/>
this; <hi>That when they who are peaceably minded
in the Nation, are ready to ſay, Theſe are the men
of whom we go in danger, it is both juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that all thoſe, of whom the people have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be afraid, ſhould pay for ſecuring the State
againſt that danger which they are the Authors of.</hi>
If you thought it <hi>operae praetium</hi> to have given
any ſatisfaction to the poor People of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for whoſe liberty you are ſo zealous, and
that it were not below you to make your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
appear reaſonable, to which you expect
preciſe obedience, being able, as you ſay, to
give many pregnant inſtances, That former
times have held this way of proceeding juſt and
reaſonable, as well in this, as in other Nations,
you would have vouchſafed to have given one,
eſpecially ſince you ſay, <hi>ſuch have been in the
memory of ſeveral perſons now living.</hi> That
which came neareſt it, yet ſtrayed at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from it, ſeems the reſolution of the Judges
in the caſe of Ship money, which were with ſo
great deteſtation condemned by the Parliament,
and your ſelves, before you were in a poſture of
governing, and for which they paid ſo dearly:
yet in that Caſe there was to be real neceſſity, an
imminent danger that the Supream Authority
might foreſee, as the Sentinel diſcovers the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
firſt, and ſo was bound to provide againſt:
but that your fears muſt be ſo complyed with,
that Armies muſt be raiſed to ſecure you, and
whoſoever you are pleaſed to be afraid of, muſt
be compelled to defray the charge of thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118635:23"/>
is a Doctrine never heard of before this
Declaration; and your fear is ſo uſefull to you,
that no proportion of Courage would do your
buſineſs half ſo well.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oportet neminem eſſe ſapientiorem legibus,</hi> is a
Maxim in the Law; and what is that Arbitrary
Power we have ſo long inveighed againſt, made
ſo many men odious with the reproach of, made,
but the endeavour to ſet up an Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
the Abridgement of all Treaſon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
which we firſt took up Arms; and for
the rooting out of which, we have ſhed and loſt
ſo much blood, what is it but the aſſuming (in
what extraordinary Caſes ſoever) upon diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to require us to do that which the Law does
not require us to do, to forbid that which the
Law doth not forbid, and to puniſh us to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
beyond what the Law directs us to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed;
to ſwarve from that rule, is to take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
and being gone, we are no longer Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
but Slaves. In the Roman State, during
the reign of the Kings, who whil'ſt that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
laſted, were very abſolute, the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
could not do an Act againſt the letter of the
Law, in favour or disfavour of any perſon, be
his merit or guilt what it would; but in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Caſes, the Appeal was to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who were to judge whether the rule was to
be declined, or no. So <hi>Horatius,</hi> for the killing
his Siſter, was condemned by the <hi>Duumviri,</hi>
who had no other power than to proceed upon
the letter of the Law; nor was it in the power of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118635:24"/>
               <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius,</hi> who was King, to alter it. But
the Appeale was to the people, they conſidered
the provocation, the teares of his Father, who
ſaid, if he had judged that his Daughter had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
unjuſtly, <hi>Se patrio jure in filium animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſurum

            <p>Our Anceſtors were ſo vigilant on our behalf,
that they would not have us accuſed without
ſome witneſs, not condemned in matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
without the full evidence of two or
three witneſſes; Nor is the ſame perſon capable
by the Law of being witneſs and Judge, if he
ſaw the Malefactor commit the offence of which
he ſtands accuſed, he cannot give his evidence as
witneſs, whilſt he is Judge; every witneſs, how
deveſted ſoever of paſſion and affection, having
in the wiſe jealouſie of the Law, too much of a
party, to be the Judge; Whereas your ſupreme
Magiſtrate, need no other evidence, but his own
ſuſpition, and if he be afraid, we are undone, for
it is plain enough, though out of your abundant
tenderneſs you impute all the fear to the people,
reſerving to your ſelves only the benefit of your
ſuſpition, to ſuſpect whom you pleaſe; you will
not truſt the people with the Prerogative of
their own fear, that they may fear as much and

hath the Monopolie of that Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;

and it is very obſervable, that you do not ſay
theſe extraordinarie payments for ſecuring the
State, ſhall be made by thoſe of whom the People
are afraid, you will not give them leave to tell
you how much they are afraid, or of whom they
are afraid, but by thoſe of whom the people
have reaſon to be afraid, and they are not
reaſonable enough to know that themſelves, you
will do it for them; and ſo you are the Law, the
Witneſs, the Judge and the Partie, and therefore
no doubt will proceed in that manner as you

the poor Royall party no more, than it

the Caſe to be our own; If the Royall party will
change their intereſt, that is, keepe their old
Monarchicall Principles, and apply them to the
ſupport of your intereſt, they ſhall be received,
entertained and preferred by you; you have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
it enough to them, by truſting none

onely in danger, of whom you are afraid, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their converſation, of their intentions
towards the preſent Government, and of their
intereſt not to ſubmit to that Government, which
you ſay is eſtabliſhed, and they believe or know
to be but uſurped. And we ſhall the better finde
who they are, and make ſome diſcoverie of the
number of them, and conſequently of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that is threatned from them, if we take a

and by what Authority it is impoſed upon us and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118635:26"/>
how far the ſeverall intereſts of thoſe, who

for, and we ſhall thereby the more eaſily judge,
how far we are obliged in conſcience or diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſubmit to it, of whom you are moſt like
to be afraid: and ſo, who are moſt probably in
the end, to be charged with the maintenance of
thoſe forces, which you will finde neceſſarie to

will not be ſecure.</p>
            <p>What is become of the Parliament; and the
Parliament partie, that firſt undertook that war
and purſued it, till they were without an eneny,
is too melancholick a queſtion to expect an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

not the Government we then undertook and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to preſerve and defend; and you will give
me leave to obſerve, that there is not one officer
in all your Armies, that in the beginning of that
warre, was above the degree of a Captaine; ſo
far are you from being the People, who bore the
heat of the day, or who deprived the enemy of
of their armes: Nor is there one perſon amongſt
you, who had then intereſt or reputation enough
to engage ten men in the quarrell; nor is one of
thoſe who had in any credit now with you, or
truſted in any part of your Government: So that
you may reaſonably conclude, that as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hold themſelves obliged to ſubmit to it, ſo
much leſſe engaged to ſupport it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

Kingly Government, erected your

members of your Parliament, all who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable
and above the reach of Juſtice, and
exerciſed what kinde of Power and Tyrannie
they pleaſed upon their fellow ſubjects; The
people were univerſally engaged to maintain and
defend that Government of the Parliament of
the Commonwealth of <hi>England;</hi> All Princes
and forraigne States taught to make their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to it; Warre and Peace declared by it;
The Keepers of the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> the
Judges and Miniſters of Juſtice, appointed in
the ſame manner, and the whole Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Juſtice throughout the Kingdome was
in the name of <hi>the Keepers of the Liberty of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
The Army profeſſed it ſelf entirely at the
obedience of the Parliament, and abſolutely
to be diſpoſed by it, and well it might do ſo,
there being ſo many Officers of the Army,
Members of Parliament, that they had reaſon to
believe all Commands would be ſuitable to their
own deſires, if they deſired no more than what
they hitherto profeſſed, the ſupport of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which not onely every perſon who
had the leaſt truſt, ſhare or benefit in it, had
ſworn to defend, but whoſoever ſued for favour
or Juſtice from it, were bound to ſubſcribe to. In
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118635:27"/>
this manner all things were ordered; <hi>Ireland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to perfect obedience, and our enemies
there to perfect ſlavery; <hi>Scotland</hi> (as your own
Poet ſayes) was preferred by Conqueſt to ſerve
us: So that we were not only without any viſible
Enemy, and ſo ſufficiently revenged of our
friends, that they could be of uſe to none but our
ſelves. The Parliament now thought it high
time, that they who were in truth the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
the People at whoſe charge alone the warre
had been carried on, ſhould receive ſome bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
from their Conqueſts; That when they had
no enemy at all, they need not have ſo great an
Army, and therefore they betook themſelves to
councels of good husbandry, and to thinke of
preferring them, who had taken ſo much paines
in their ſervice, to eaſe and plenty; to give thoſe
Eſtates to them, which they had taken from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and by theſe gratuities to disband ſome
part of their Army; But that was a Juriſdiction,
you never intended they ſhould exerciſe, you
were well enough contented that they ſhould
have the Soveraigne power to raiſe money, for
the payment of the Armies, but when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to ſpeak of disbanding thoſe Armies, you
wiſely remembred how inſecure you ſhould be
without thoſe forces, which had raiſed you to
the height you were at, you remembred how
many former orders you had diſobeyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how
you had triumphed over the long Robe, and the

brought armed men into the houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
forced the Members with many oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious
ſpeeches to leave their places, locked up
the doors, that there might be no more reſort
thither, and appointed a ſelect number of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Army to provide for all, that King
or Parliament uſed to do; and here was an end
of your Commonwealth, which Government all
were ſo ſolemnly engaged to defend; nor is there
any perſon, who adheres to the Principles of a
Commonwealth in any truſt or eſteeme with
you: Nay, it is very obſervable and notorious,
that of all that ſelect number which helped you
to be free from Monarchy, by ſitting in that
Court, and who dare no more look a Monarch in
the face, than they dare juſtify what they have
done at the day of Judgment, there is not one
man in credit with you, nor of command in any
of your Armies by Sea or Land; nay; whom you
have not eminently affronted, diſobliged and
and oppreſſed, except he hath ſuch a relation of
blood, as may render him unſuſpected. And
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118635:28"/>
can you think theſe men friends to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

            <p>Your next Government was entirely by the
Armie, which as if it had not fought to ſuppreſſe
all exorbitancy of power, but to poſſeſs it ſelf of
it, and was now ſufficiently qualified to do all,
that others had or would have done before, laid
Taxes and impoſitions upon the Kingdom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
over all the ill things which had been
complained of before, in moſt intolerable and
inſupportable degrees, and improved the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
to that height, that there was no ſhadow

               </gap>action
in Gods worſhip, that there were more Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
than Regiments, and all practiſed with equall
licence, and animoſity againſt each other, when
on the ſuddain the Generall of the Army (if he
can be called a Generall whoſe Commiſſion was
determined, by the determination of that Body
that granted it, the Parliament) takes upon him
to aſſemble another number of people, every
man choſen by himſelf, and that Councell of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Army, who were conſtituted by
himſelf, and making their appearance before
him, called them a Parliament, called himſelf
their ſervant, and beſought them to repaire thoſe
breaches and ruines of the Commonwealth,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118635:28"/>
which their wiſedom could only do, moſt of them
being men of no parts, no experience, no quality,
no intereſt in the Kingdom, ſerving only to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the venerable name of Parliament ridiculous
by their frivolous and impertinent conſultations,
without doing any ſober act in order to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the wounds of the Commonwealth, as their
Predeceſſors had made it odious by taking upon
them ſo unlimited a power to vex and grieve,
and devour their Brethren. And when theſe had
brought themſelves into a ſufficient reproach and
diſeſtimation of the people, and yet could not be
enough united amongſt themſelves, to ſerve the
Generalls turn, part of them went to him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
themſelves too weak to ſuſtain the great
burthen he had laid upon their ſhoulders; and
deſired him to take the power again, which he
he had ſo graciouſly conferred on them, and that
he would take upon himſelf the ordering and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
the Commonwealth, which they had not
wiſedom to do. The other part, that had a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opinion of their own abilities, and believed
they might find ſome proper remedies for the
publique grievances, were according to the late
method turned out of doors by the Souldiers,
that they might no more continue thoſe unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Conſultations: And ſo by theſe few Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts
repaying the ſmall money he had lent
them, the Generall takes Livery and Seiſin of
the whole Treaſure of the Kingdom, and thinks
this a ſufficient delegation of the power, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Nation into his hands, of which he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118635:29"/>
makes uſe within few dayes after, and with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
and unexpected ſolemnitie, the Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
of <hi>London,</hi> the Judges and the Keepers of
the great Seal, being ſummoned to attend, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing any part of the buſines, upon the
advice and by the conſent of half a ſcore of his
friends, who were like to look that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no hurt, He degrades himſelf from the
Office of Generall, and unlimited power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as he ſayes; and is contented under the ſtile
of Protector of the three Kingdomes, of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be reſtrained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the limits he had prepared for himſelf, laid
aſide his Excellency to be his Highneſs, and
contented himſelf with all the Crown Lands
which were left unſold, and a limited power
(as he called it,) extending farther than ever
King pretended to; and this was the riſe and
progreſſe of your preſent Government, to which
you expect ſuch an obedience, as muſt produce a
reall change of all our Principles and intereſt;
and if we are but thought to have evill intentions
towards this Government, we muſt be at the
charge of the Armies raiſed to ſecure it.</p>
            <p>That which diſpoſed the mindes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to abſtaine from a preſent Proteſtation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this Government, beſides the Agony of
the late confuſions, and the aſtoniſhment upon
the new wonderfull alteration, was, that it was
but temporary, and that limited to a very ſhort
time; A free Parliament was to be called within
ſo many moneths, which was entirely to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118635:29"/>
and ſettle the Government of the Kingdom,
to remove all thoſe obſtructions which hinder
the Peace and happineſs of the Nation, and to
reſtore it to that tranquillity and quiet it had
been ſo long deprived of: And the Protector
was ſworn to a due obſervation of all thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
which he had himſelf preſcribed for his
own rules and bounds, and therefore the more
hope that he would be contented to be limited by
them. It cannot be denied that the Kingdom
choſe many worthy perſons of fortune, intereſt
and experience, as their Deputies to provide for
the publique ſecurity, who entred upon a free
diſquiſition of the ſtate the Kingdom was in, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the very Method preſcribed by the
Inſtrument of Government; and to enquire by
what means and title; ſo vaſte and tranſcendent
a power was gotten into the hands of one man;
ſo contrary to what had been before determined;
many men profeſſing, that if after ſo much blood
ſpilt and calamities undergone by the people, to
free them from Monarchique Government, it
ſhould be now found moſt agreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and temper of the Nation, to return to the
ſame forme of ſubjection, there could be little
doubt, it would be much better to reſtore it to the
Royall Perſon, to whom by the line of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
the unqueſtionable Right was derived, and
whoſe being poſſeſſed of it would in a moment
reſtore the whole Nation to a full and entire
Peace, from whoſe unblemiſhed youth and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
diſpoſition, as much of happineſs might be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118635:30"/>
expected, as had been enjoyed in any former
Kings Raign, than by continuing it in the hands
of an Uſurper, who had violated ſo many Oaths
and Proteſtations already, and had aſcended to
this pitch only by the moſt bare-faced breach of
ſeverall truſts, that ever Chriſtian or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was guilty of, to expoſe the Kingdom to a
warre, that could have no end, but in the ruine
and deſolation of it. Theſe grave, neceſſary and
important debates, were no ſooner entred into,
than in contempt of all Privileges of Parliament,
which will not allow matters in debate to be
taken notice of, the Protector, like a King;
<hi>Nam impune quaelibet facere, id eſt, Regem eſſe,</hi>
ſummons them into his preſence, with the higheſt
and ſharpeſt language, reproaches them for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
his Authority, by whom they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
together; requires them to renounce and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
that liberty, before they proceeded to
further conſultation, and to that purpoſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
an Inſtrument without ſubſcribing to
which, the Band of Souldiers which guarded the
door of the Parliament houſe, would not ſuffer
any man to enter, whereupon a Major part of the
Parliament departed to their houſes, and they
only went in, who ſubmitted to the conditions,
which many afterwards did, who in deteſtation
of the violence, at that time had forborne to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.
Thus he, who without the conſent or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of a dozen perſons, had aſſumed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the title and ſtile of <hi>Protector</hi> of three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and therefore found a generall ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118635:30"/>
becauſe he had bound himſelf within a
ſhort time to call a Parliament, that might ſettle
the Government, when it was now met and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of the power it was to have, becauſe they
came together upon his call, would not ſuffer
them to queſtion any thing he had done, or what
he ſhould do hereafter, their ſubmiſſion (as he
ſaid) to his Authority of ſummoning them, being
a tacit acknowledgement of his power, which he
would not endure to be argued againſt, without
calling to minde (beſides the practice of theſe
laſt ill years) that by the expreſs letter of the
Law,<note place="margin">Lo. <hi>Cook</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſd. of Co. fol. 42.</note> 
               <hi>any reſtraint from altering or revoking an
Ordinance or Act of Parliament it ſelf, is voyd,
being againſt the juriſdiction and power of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he had thus reformed his Parliament,
he gave them leave to ſit together, to conſult
how they might contribute to the ſupport of that
power they were not able to impair, and to lay
new burthens on the People, the envy whereof
they ſhould rather bear than himſelf. But as the
Pope <hi>(Paul</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) complained in the Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of thoſe who reported he could make but four
Cardinals,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Conc.</note> in regard of that which he had ſworn
in the Conclave, and ſaid,<note place="margin">Tr. fol. 396.</note> 
               <hi>That this was to binde
the Popes Authority, which is abſolute; That it is
an Article of Faith, that the Pope cannot be bound,
and much leſs can binde himſelf; and that to ſay
otherwiſe, was a manifeſt Hereſy.</hi> So he took it
very ill, that they ſhould believe upon any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
in the Inſtrument of Government, to which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118635:31"/>
he had ſo ſolemnly ſworn before he aſſumed the
Title, that they might leſſen his Power, or the
Army, by which it is ſupported; and therefore
when he ſaw they betook themſelves to thoſe
Counſels, which might leſſen the inſupportable
burthen the People undergo for the maintenance
of as numerous Forces, and greater indeed, than
were ever on foot when the Common Enemy
had Towns and Armies to oppoſe, and that they
preſumed to ſpeak of disbanding part of them,
he ſent for them, and after he had, <hi>ſtylo Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torio,</hi>
reprehended their preſumption, and check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in ſharper language than ever King
gave himſelf leave to uſe to his Subjects in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
contrary to his Oath, and before the
time was expired which was aſſigned for their
ſitting, he diſſolved them, and takes upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Authority, with the conſent of ſuch, whom
he pleaſes to make of his Councel, to make
and repeal Laws, to lay Taxes and Impoſitions
upon the People, and, which is the higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
that can be made of his Tyrannie, to
publiſh this Declaration; whereas it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the Law, <hi>That to commit the power of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to a few, is againſt the dignity of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and no ſuch Commiſſion can be granted, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by the Parliament it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know, how ſtrange ſoever it be, that all
this is true; and you may then eaſily compute,
of what rank or kinde of men they muſt be, who
are delighted, or in their hearts not oppoſite, to
your preſent Government: how very few there
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118635:31"/>
are in your Councel or Army, who were for
King and Parliament, and how thoſe Principles
have been aſſerted by you, is known to all men;
what affection they have for you, who with ſo
much hazard and infamy ſerved you in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing
the Monarchy, and what indignities
they receive at your hands, is likewiſe within
your own view. What is become of thoſe two
ſwelling names, which for ſo long time filled
our mouths, and under the ſhelter of one of
which all men took Sanctuary, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
and <hi>Independents?</hi> Is there one man of either
party, who without renouncing the Principles
of his party, is in credit or truſt with you? and
do they not both every day expect from you the
exemplification of that memorable Judgement
of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who upon the hearing a
difference that was fallen out between two men
of very ſeditious and turbulent natures, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
<hi>That the one of them ſhould preſently fly
out of</hi> Macedon,<note place="margin">Vit. Phil.</note> 
               <hi>and the other ſhould run after
him as faſt as he could.</hi> You ſee then how very
few there can be in the three Kingdomes (except
thoſe who poſſeſs great Offices and Eſtates from
you, (and even of thoſe, many think themſelves
diſobliged, by ſeeing others of leſs merit than
they think themſelves, more obliged) who are
without malice and revenge in their heart, and
ſuch a leaning and adhering to their ſeveral old
intereſts, that nothing is wanting for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thereof, but a fitting opportunity; and you
have declared that propenſion and diſpoſition in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118635:32"/>
them, to be Crime enough to forfeit all that
they have; and you cannot wonder, if upon ſo
fair warning, they prepare as well as they can,
and at leaſt good reſolutions, for their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.
Alas, Sir, we know how little confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
you have in any of your old Friends, who
you believe will never heartily ſubmit to a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
they never intended to erect, and who
have not ſacrificed their wealth, their blood, and
their peace, to ſuppreſs a Royal Family, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
by a ſucceſſion of ſo many hundred
years to command, and to be obeyed; and to
inveſt another, inferiour to moſt of our ſelves,
in the ſame intereſt and power, and ſo (to uſe
your own expreſſion) <hi>to entail the quarrel, and
prevent the means to reconcile Poſterity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 38.</note> You ſay,
you will not in expreſs tearms lay to the charge
of the Royal Party, the ſwarming of thoſe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
which are now croaking amongſt us, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves into all forms and ſhapes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and ſeduce men from the Truth. I wiſh
we had not all too much reaſon to charge you in
expreſs tearms with what you will not, and no
doubt cannot charge them. What liberty the
Prieſts and Jeſuits take, how far they prevail
upon the People, what countenance they receive
from this Government, is apparent enough, by
not proceeding againſt them in Juſtice, as if no
Laws were in force for their puniſhment. Your
private Negotiations with the Pope, and your
promiſes, that as ſoon as you can eſtabliſh your
own Greatneſs, you will protect the Catholicks;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118635:32"/>
and the inſinuations that you will countenance
them much further, are ſufficiently known and
underſtood? And of their dependance upon,
and devotion to you, there needs no evidence
beyond the Book lately written by Mr. <hi>White,</hi>
a Romiſh Prieſt, and dedicated to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,
Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> entituled, <hi>The Grounds

ought to be ſo far from performing any promiſe,
or obſerving any Oath you have taken, if you
know that it is for the good of the People, that
you break it, albeit they foreſeeing all that you
now ſee, did therefore binde you by Oath not to
do it,<note place="margin">Pag. 89.</note> 
               <hi>That you offend againſt both your Oath and
Fidelity to the People, if you maintain thoſe limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
you are ſworn to:</hi> and ſure what you do,
muſt be ſupported by ſuch Caſuiſts. Laſtly, we
know very well, how far you are from confiding
in your own Army, how jealous you are of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Officers, and more of the Common
Souldiers, and therefore that you raiſe thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
little Armies in the ſeveral Counties, with
which you hope to ſuppreſs or controul the
ſtanding Armie upon any occaſion, when the
ſenſe of their own and their Countries miſerable
condition ſhall render it leſs devoted to you.
And we likewiſe know, how in diſtruſt of the
whole Engliſh Nation, you are treating to bring
over a Body of <hi>Swiſſe</hi> to ſerve you, as the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries
do the Turk, and in order to controul
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118635:33"/>
your own Army, as well as to reduce the People
to an implicit obedience to your Government.
That moſt of the Money which was collected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us for the poor Proteſtants of the Valley
of <hi>Lucern,</hi> is returned and applyed to the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on thoſe Levies; and that many are already

upon pretence that they are to be ſent to plant
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereas they are kept for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
thoſe Regiments which are every day
expected to arrive: and then you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
your work, and brought the onely laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
calamity upon the Kingdome, which you
have hitherto forborn to do, and with which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
reproach you charged the Counſels of the
former times, onely for intending to introduce
forreign Forces.</p>
            <p>I cannot end this Diſcourſe, without taking
notice of your ſo frequent mention throughout
this Declaration, and indeed upon all occaſions
in your ordinary converſation, of the continued
aſſiſtance and preſence of God in whatſoever
you have gone about, of his gratious diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and his viſible hand manifeſted in your ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
and of his more than uſual care and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
towards you; whereas if you would ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
revolve what is paſſed, and diſpaſſionately
conſider and weigh your preſent condition, it
may be you would finde your Caſe ſo rare and
wonderfull, that there have ſeldome been a
People in the World who have had more reaſon
to believe themſelves to lye under the ſignal and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118635:33"/>
terrible diſpleaſure of God Almighty, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom his vengeance is more manifeſtly
threatned, than you at preſent have. You have
had all the advantages, and all the ſucceſſes,
which you could ever propoſe and hope for, and
ſome greater than you could hope for, and your
perplexities and inſecurity remains greater than
before; you have not an Enemy in the three
Kingdomes, who ſtands in oppoſition of your
power, or who indeed is Owner of a Sword to
reſiſt you, and yet you avow and diſcover ſuch a
proportion of fear, that new Armies muſt be
raiſed for your defence; you have gotten all the
Wealth of the three Kingdomes into your
hands, and enjoy none, your wants and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
being ſo great; when you had little credit,
and leſs intereſt to do good or harm, you had
many Friends, and few who hated you; and
now it is in your power to make great whom you
pleaſe, and to deſtroy all whom you are angry
with, your Friends leave and forſake you; and
you are grown ſo univerſally odious, that you
may ſay to thoſe who adhere to you,<note place="margin">Saluſt.</note> as <hi>Catiline</hi>
did to his Army, <hi>Neque locus, neque amicus
quiſquam teget, quem arma non texerint.</hi> All
your ſafety is in your Army, and yet you fear
that little leſs than your Enemies. How many of
thoſe who bore parts with you in your darkeſt
Deſigns, have laid violent hands upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
out of the conſcience of their own wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs?
And is not that Curſe in <hi>Leviticus</hi>
fallen upon the reſt? <hi>And upon them that are

               <hi>I will ſend faintneſs into their

of a ſhaken leaf ſhall chaſe them, and they ſhall flee,
as fleeing from a ſword, and they ſhall fall, when
none purſues.</hi> Can there be a greater ſlavery,
than to be afraid of thoſe whom you have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued?
And hath not God delivered you, as he
did thoſe of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 29. 8.</note> 
               <hi>to trouble, to
aſtoniſhment, and to hiſſing, as you ſee with your
eyes?</hi> So that in truth, ſetting aſide the peace
and tranquillity of minde, which muſt prepare
the joyes of the next World for us, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
meerly the delight and pleaſure in this,
into which ſome degree of reputation, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of ſome Friends, and the fidelity of thoſe
we truſt, are neceſſary Ingredients; I had rather
be the moſt undone man that this Declaration
hath preyed upon, than my <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> or
any one of his Councel in whoſe names it is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
            <p>To conclude. As it is manifeſtly deſtructive
to all the liberty and property of the People, and
to the Laws of the Kingdome, by obſervation
whereof alone thoſe liberties, and that property
can be preſerved: ſo to common underſtanding
it muſt be the moſt fatal Inſtrument againſt your
own intereſt and ſecurity, and make all men ſee
how inconſiſtent theirs is with the Government
you have erected. You have pulled up Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by the roots, which are the onely natural
ſecurity the Nation can have againſt Oppreſſion
and Tyrannie, and which we thought we had
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118635:34"/>
exactly provided for by the Triennial Bill, and
which will at preſent authorize the People to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
and make their Elections. You have can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
all Obligations of Truſt, and taken away
all poſſible confidence from all men that they
can ever enjoy any thing that they can call their
own during this Government; and having ſo
little pleaſure left them in life, they will preferre
the loſing it in ſome Noble Attempt to free their
Country and themſelves from the bondage and
ſervitude they live under, to the dying ignobly
in ſome loathſome Priſon, when you pleaſe to be
afraid of them. Do not value your ſelves upon
the terrour you infuſe into the People, by your
frequent Sacrifices of Blood, and expoſing their
Friends to them on Scaffolds, and on Gallows.
Remember that it is recorded of <hi>Ann de Burg,</hi>
who was burnt in <hi>France</hi> in the year 1559. upon
matter of Religion, That the death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
of a man ſo conſpicuous, did make many
curious to know, what Religion that was, for
which he had ſo couragiouſly endured puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and made the numbers increaſe exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Truſt me, you have gotten nothing by thoſe
Spectacles, and men return from them more
confirmed in their deteſtation of you, than ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
from any of their purpoſes towards you.
And when the deſpair you have put them into
ſhall make them conſider, that as the miſery, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
ſervitude and infamy under which the
three Kingdomes ſuffer, proceed entirely from
you, ſo, that they will be determined with you.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118635:35"/>
That the general hatred and deteſtation of you
is ſuch, that it is very probable that thoſe Noble
Patriots, whoſe ſpirits ſhall be raiſed to deſtroy
you, ſhall not onely reap unutterable Honour
from it, but finde ſafety in it, either from the
Confuſion that muſt inſtantly attend, or from
the abhorring your Memories in thoſe that ſhall
ſurvive you. If they ſhall periſh in or upon
