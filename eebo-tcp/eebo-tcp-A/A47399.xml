            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>race, but that it was a Rite of the Legal Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64346:3"/>We shall now proceed to Answer the other Objections, having the last Day only insisted upon One.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obj. <hi>Circumcision was the Type of Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Answ.</hi> If the Circumcision of the Heart was the Antitype of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision in the Flesh, then certainly Baptism was not, could not be the Antitype thereof; but this the Holy Ghost fully intimates, was the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of it, see 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. <hi>See Dr.</hi> Taylor, <hi>as recited in</hi> Rector Rectified, p. 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Baptism, and Circumcision were both in Force together for some time, then Baptism is not the Antitype of, nor did it come in the room of Circumcision, but that they were both in Force together for some time, I shewed before. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Disciples of Christ, Baptized. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.1, 2. sometime before Circumcision was <hi>nailed to the Cross,</hi> or did cease. Can one thing come in the room, or place of another, till the other is actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and legally removed, and took away? Why, now since these Two Rites had a Being together, I affirm (as I have formerly done) one could not be the Type of the other. A Type can abide no longer, then till the Antitype is come; therefore Circumcision was not the Type of Baptism.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> and <hi>lastly,</hi> (As to this) I see not indeed, how one Thing, that was a Figure, could be the proper Shadow, or Type of a Figure; sure no Wise Man has Reason so to think; all may see, that Baptism it self, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Figure, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. And this is sufficient to remove the Second Objection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obj. The Third Objection I mentioned, is this, <hi>viz. Infants were once in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and never cast out, therefore they are in still</hi>: See Mr. <hi>Rothwell</hi>'s <hi>Paedo-Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I Answer, Tho' Infants were in Covenant under the Law, in the Legal Church of the Jews, and that by God's Appointment. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. which is not denied: Yet, what of this? their being once Members of the <hi>Iewish Church,</hi> doth not prove them to be Members of the <hi>Gospel Church:</hi> They had then many outward Privileges, which we, under the Gospel, have not; they went all off when the <hi>Ax was laid to the Root, i. e.</hi> When the Old Covenant was ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ogated, and the Old Church State cut down, then their Old Church Members fell likewise: The Branches cannot stand, when the Tree is cut down, or rooted up.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have proved the Covenant; for in Covenanting of Infants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, was no Gospel Covenant; and therefore this Objection hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nothing in it to hurt us, unless it can be proved, they were taken a-new into the Gospel Church, or Gospel Covenant, which we positively deny and they can't disprove: For, according to that Maxim, <hi>Omnis Privati intimat babitum,</hi> (you know) that every Dispossession; implyeth a Possess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Answ.</hi>
               <q>I answer (<hi>saith he</hi>) they were so, in regard of their Use to the Jews, who, in using them (as it were) Subscribed to their own Guiltiness of Death and Damnation.— In using Circumcision, they made known they had ordinal Sin, and were guilty of it; their Washings shewed, they were exceeding filthy in God's sight, and so guilty of the Curse of the Law, and so did their Sacrifices. Hence God, in infinite Mercy, sent his Son to pay our Debts; and he has satisfied Divine Justice, and so has cancelled this Hand-Writing, that witnessed our Guiltiness, and bound us over to Punishment. —</q>
What good will it do them, to grant That Circumcision was part of the Law, I know not, these Things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>

but of the Old; <hi>neither the First Covenant was dedicated without Blood,</hi> Heb. 9.18. True, the Blood of the Old Covenant, figured the Blood of the New, yet that doth no more prove the Ceremonial Law, was part of the New Covenant, then the Shadow can be proved to be the Substance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' those Sacrifices pointed to Christ, yet that Law was part of the Covenant of Works, <hi>i. e.</hi> no Life by it: In those Sacrifices, God's <hi>Soul had no</hi> Pleasure.</p>

Obj. <hi>God gave himself to</hi> Abraham <hi>to be his God, and the God of his Seed, in the Covenant of Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or made over himself by way of special Interest to them in it; (so Mr.</hi> Flavell <hi>positively affirms.) Therefore it was the Covenant of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I Answer, This I am persuaded, is the grand Cause of their great boldness and mistake, in affirming the Covenant of Circumcision was the Covenant of Grace; and therefore, ought the more carefully to be Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Considered, and Answered; for if Mr. <hi>Flavel,</hi> and the rest of our Brethren, are right in this Assertion, <hi>i. e.</hi> That God gave himself in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to all his Seed, to be their God, by way of special Interest, they say a great deal, but this we deny.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Abraham,</hi> God gave himself to him to be his God, yea, gave him special Interest in himself; but it was before he gave him the Covenant of Circumcision. This they cannot deny, nay, and not only to himself, but to be the God of all his true spiritual Seed, and that also, before he ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the said Covenant of Circumcision with him, and his natural Seed; see <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. <hi>I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great Reward</hi>; see <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and then 'tis said, <hi>he believed in the Lord, and it was accounted to him for righteousness,</hi> ver. 6.— Therefore,</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> 'Tis for ever to be noted, that this <hi>special Interest in God,</hi> he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through Faith, in the Free Promise (which is the Covenant of Grace God made with him) And the Apostle plainly shews, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.9, 10. That this Blessedness, he (in the Negative) received not in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumcision, but in Uncircumcision. <hi>How was it then reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision,</hi> ver. 10. I cannot but wonder at the darkness of those Men, who affirm, That <hi>Abraham</hi> received special Interest in God, in the Covenant of Circumcision; whereas the Holy Ghost positively denies it, or affirms the contrary. His main Business being there to take them off of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64346:5"/>
Circumcision, and so to distinguish between Circumcison, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Faith; but, in direct Opposition to the Apostle's Design, these Men go about to magnifie Circumcision by ascribing it to that.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And let it also be noted, That the same Apostle excludes <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed as such, (with whom the Covenant of Circumcision was made) from this special Blessing of special Interest in God, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect, for they are not all Israel, which are of Israel; neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all Children</hi>: (that is, by way of special Interest in God, so as to have God to be their God, by vertue of the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham</hi>) <hi>But in Isaac shall thy seed be called,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>That is, they which are the children of the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh, these are not the children of God; but the children of the promise, are counted for the seed,</hi> ver. 8. None can deny, but that those, whom the Apostle calls the Children of the Flesh (whom he denies to have any Interest in God as such) the Covenant of Circumcision did belong unto, and was made with, as well as it was made with the true spiritual Seed; therefore I may from hence, with the greatest boldness imaginable, affirm, That in the Covenant of Circumcision, God did not make over himself to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s God, so as to give him, or to his Seed, special Interest in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But 'tis positively said, That God did promise in the Covenant of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to be a God to him, and to his seed after him, in their Generations,</hi> when he promised them the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Gen. 17.8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I do not deny it, but not by way of special Interest (that is, the thing we differ in) so he was not the God of his Seed as such, according to the Nature of the Covenant of Grace, and that for the Reasons before ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; therefore it behoveth us to consider, in what respect we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Holy Ghost. I do not say neither, that ever God made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self over to Men, to be their God, by way of special Interest, upon the Terms of the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, that was impossible for them to Answer, (nor can I believe, notwithstanding what Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> has affirmed, that my <hi>Reverend Brother,</hi> Mr. <hi>Philip Cary,</hi> will assert any such thing) the <hi>Inheritance was not by the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Therefore we are to consider, That God may be said to be the God of a People, in a Covenant way, Two manner of ways.</p>

               <item>1<hi>st. By the Free Promise,</hi> or Covenant of Grace in a spiritual Gospel Sense, which gives special and Soul-saving Interest in him, as all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Seed, i. e.</hi> True Believers have; or,</item>

married to the whole House of <hi>Israel,</hi> as so considered, and to be <hi>an Husband to them:</hi> See <hi>Ier.</hi> 21.31. God there makes a Promise to <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> that he would make a New Covenant, <hi>Not according to the covenant I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt (which covenant they break, although I was an husband to them saith the Lord)</hi> ver. 32 In this Covenant God gave them their Church State, and many external or earthly Blessings, Laws and Ordinances, and they formerly struck Hands (as I may so say) with God, and promised Obedience, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.3, 7, 8. <hi>And he took the book of the Covenant, and read in the audience of the people, and they said, all that the Lord hath said, will we do and be obedient:</hi> And thus God became as an Husband to them, <hi>i. e. He fed them,</hi> and <hi>took special care of them,</hi> and <hi>to lead them with great Bowels in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,</hi> and <hi>bestowed the Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>upon them,</hi> with other Temporal Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, according as it was promised to them in the Covenant of Circumcision: Like as a Husband cares for, and provides for the Wife, so did God care and provide for them and preserved them, so long as that Law (I mean the Law of their Husband) did continue: But that Law is now dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. and God now is no longer such a Husband to them, nor hath he Married in that Sense any other external Nation, or People of the World; but now God, in the Gospel Covenant, is an Husband indeed; to them he was but a Typical Husband, and their God in an external Faedoral Relation: And thus he was the God of all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Off-spring; for, in him, he <hi>first espoused them as a National Church,</hi> and People, and gave them the Covenant of Circumcision, as the Sign, or Token thereof, with many <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil Rites.</hi> And this is further confirmed by a <hi>Reverend and Learned Writer:</hi>
                  <q>Howbeit from the strict Connexion of this 7th. <hi>verse</hi> with the 6th. and the Assurance here given, that God will establish his Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, to be their God: It is evident (<hi>saith he</hi>) that the Number of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s carnal Seed and the Grandeur of their Civil State, is not all that is promised, nor yet the Principal Blessing bestowed on them therein, but rather the forming them into a Church State, with the establishing of the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of publick Worship among them, wherein they should walk in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Relation to God, as his peculiar People: Understand it still (<hi>saith he</hi>) of the Old Covenant, wherein they had their peculiar Right and Privilege, no less can be intended in this, <hi>I will be a God unto them, in their Generations</hi>; and it is also made more evident by the following Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that is given of this Transaction, with respect to <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ishmael, Gen.</hi> 17.18, 21. When the Lord had promised unto <hi>Abraham</hi> a Son, by <hi>Sarah,</hi> whose Name should be called <hi>Isaac,</hi> he thus prayed, <hi>O that Ishmael might live before thee! which the Chaldee Paraphraseth thus,</hi> i. e. <hi>Might live and worship before thee.</hi> No doubt, his Prayer was, that <hi>Ishmael</hi> might also be an Heir of the Blessing of this Covenant; but that was not granted to him; for the Lord would have <hi>his Covenant Seed called by</hi> Isaac <hi>only:</hi> With him God would establish his Covenant, having appointed and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64346:6"/>
him alone, to be the Heir thereof, who was to be the Child of the Promise, and Son of the Free woman; and yet for <hi>Ishmael,</hi> in special Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with <hi>Abraham,</hi> whose Seed he was: Thus much he obtained, <hi>i. e.</hi> That he should be made Fruitful, and multiply exceedingly, Twelve Princes, or Heads of great Families, should spring of him; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports some Analogy to the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> after the Flesh, and God would make him a great Nation; and yet, all this fell short of the Blessings of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Off-spring, by <hi>Isaac,</hi> from which <hi>Ishmael</hi> was now excluded: It is plain therefore, that the <hi>Privilege</hi> of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, as well as the flourishing of the Civil States of <hi>Israel,</hi> did arise unto them out of the Covenant of Circumcision.</q>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <q>We conclude therefore (<hi>saith he</hi>) That notwithstanding the carnal Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> could not as such, claim a Right in the spiritual and eternal Blessings of the New Covenant, because of their Interest in the Covenant of Circumcision, yet their Privileges, and Advantages in their Church-State, tho' immediately consisting in things outward and typical, were of far greater Value and Use, than any meer Worldly, or Earthly Blessings, as to giving them choice means of the Knowledge of God, and setting them nearer to him, than any Nation in the World besides.</q>
Thus far this Learned Author.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> also, in his Sermon preach'd at Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Funeral, shews, That God may be said to be the God of a People, several manner of ways. 1.
<q>Upon the Account of Creation: Thus he is our God and Father O <hi>Lord thou art our father, we are the clay, and thou art our potter, and we all are the work of thy hands,</hi> Isa. 64.8</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.
<q>Upon the Account of external Calling, and Profession, there is an intercurrent Relation of the Father and Son, between God and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Thus the Posterity of <hi>Seth,</hi> are called, the Sons of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. and the entire Nation of the Jews are so styled: <hi>When Israel was young, I called my son from Egypt,</hi> Hos. 11. And all that have received Baptism, the Seal of the Holy Covenant, and profess Christianity, in this general Sense, may be called the Children of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he clearly confirms what I have said; but observe, in this Sense, God is not said to be the God of a People by way of special Interest.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But 'tis not (<hi>saith he</hi>) the outward Dedication, entitles Men to saving Interest in God, unless they live according to that Dedication. There are Baptised Infidels, as well as Unbaptised, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Sure none can deny, but, <hi>by gross Idolatry,</hi> the <hi>Israelites</hi> broke this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and yet, when they, in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s time, became guilty of vile Abominations, the Lord still claimed an Interest in their Children, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Covenant. <hi>Moreover, thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast born unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64346:6"/>
Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter, That thou hast slain my children,</hi> Ezek. 16.20, 12. The Children they begat in a natural way, when by cursed Idolatry, they had Apostatized from God, (by vertue of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) God calls his Children, which could not have been, if their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Interest had been as our Brethren affirm, <hi>i. e.</hi> suspended on the good abearing, or Faith of immediate Parents: But, as the <hi>Apostacy</hi> of Parents could not hinder their Children from that external Covenant Interest they had in God, and God in them, so the Faith and Holiness of Parents, could not Interest their Children in the special Blessings of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> 'Tis remarkable, that when God gave the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.1, 2. where he pleads Interest in them as his People, he mentions expresly, upon what account he so owned them; read the Text, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the House of Bondage, Thou shalt have no other Gods before me.</hi> I am Jehovah, and thy God, having chosen you to be a People to my self above all People; as 'tis said elsewhere, not that as they were thus his People, and a chosen Nation, they had special Interest in God by eternal Election, and peculiar Adoption, no, but a few of them (as it appears) were in that sence, his People: But their God, by vertue of that <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>external Covenant</hi> he made with their Fathers, and now again with them, and so bestowed temporal Blessings upon them; therefore 'tis added, <hi>That brought thee out of the land of Egypt,</hi> not Land of spiritual Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor house of spiritual Bondage, but literal Bondage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <q>In the Covenant of Works, (saith Reverend Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>) the Lord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himself, upon a Condition of Works; he bid them obey his Voice, and provoke him not; for I will not pardon your Transgressions.— But, in the Covenant of Grace, he will do this, but not in the Covenant of Works; all is given upon Condition of Obedience.

               <hi>Obj.</hi> 6. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Circumcision was a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith. <hi>If Circumcision was the Seal of the Righteousness of Faith</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Flavell</hi>) <hi>it did not appertain to the Covenant of Works: For the Righteousness of Faith and Works, are opposite; but Circumcision was the Seal of the Righteousness of Faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11. <hi>Ergo,</hi> pag. 220.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Answ.</hi> We Answer first, That the Text they bring, doth not call Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision the Seal of the Righteousness of Faith: As 'tis such, or in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all that were Circumcised, pray let us read the Words; <hi>And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64346:7"/>
had them yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:</hi> Rom. 4.11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Observe Circumcision is directly, here called a Sign, and so it was in it self:
<list>
                  <item>1. A Sign, or Token of God's making good his Covenant to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, that from his Loins Christ should come by <hi>Isaac.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. A Sign, or Token, that the promise of all these Blessings granted to them, either <hi>Ecclesiastical, respecting their National Church State, and Civil State, and Temporal Blessings, with their Possessing of the Land of Canaan.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Of the Circumcision of the Heart,</hi> for that it was a Sign of.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But it is not called any more a Seal to <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the Righteousness of that Faith, he had before he was Circumcised, then it was of his being the Father of all them that believe Now since it was principally called a Seal to him, of that peculiar Privilege, and Prerogative, of being the Father of all True Believers, which none had ever granted to them besides himself, Why should they suppose, that Circumcision is here called, a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith to all, as well as to <hi>Abraham</hi> himself? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire this may be considered; for Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> passes it by in silence, and speaks nothing to it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To put the Matter out of doubt, it could be a Seal to no other Person, or Persons, but to <hi>Abraham</hi> only. Because it was a Seal of that Righteousness <hi>Abraham</hi> had, being yet Uncircumcised, and such a Righteousness, none of his Seed ever had actually, as he had it; (neither of his fleshly, nor spiritual Seed) for first, <hi>Isaac</hi> had no such Faith before he was Circumcised, because Circumcised when but Eight Days old, and so were generally all his Seed, except you will mention such, who neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Circumcise their Children, and so Transgressed the Command of God, or mention Adult Proselites.</p>
            <p>But that will not help the Matter; they must carry it to be a Seal to all that the Covenant of Circumcision belonged to, or else to none but to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> only: but to all, it could not be a Seal, as it was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing positively said, not to be a Seal of the Righteousness of their Faith, they should have after Circumcised, but of that Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> particularly had, being yet Uncircumcised.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Scope and Drift of the Holy Ghost, proves it to be thus as we say; for else, there's no need for the Apostle to mention it, as a Seal of that Righteousness of Faith, he had before Circumcision, if others might have it in Circumcision, <hi>viz.</hi> The Righteousness of God, as 'tis contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Covenant of Grace: (for that they must say, or they say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) And it farther appears by what the Apostle speaks, <hi>viz. That he might be the Father of them that believe, that were not Circumcised.</hi> If it had been in Circumcision, or after Circumcision, What Argument would there have been in the Case, <hi>i. e.</hi> That <hi>Abraham</hi> should be the Father of those that believe, that are not Circumcised.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64346:7"/>Therefore, in direct Opposition to what Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> speaks, as cited by Mr. <hi>Flavel,</hi> I must say, The main Drift and Scope of the Apostle's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the Coherence of the Text, is to take off the Jews from seeking any spiritual Benefit from Circumcision, or the Law, but by Faith, only seeing; <hi>Abraham</hi> was Justified, and received the Righteousness of Christ, by Faith, before he was Circumcised, or without Circumcision; and his receiving Circumcision, sealed not only the Righteousness of Faith to him, which he had, being Uncircumcised, (and so to none else) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <hi>his being the Father of all that Believe, whether Circumcised, or not Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. But again, it must be granted to belong to <hi>Abraham,</hi> only as a Seal, because St. <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of Circumcision, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12. says, The chief Advantage, or Privilege, they had thereby, was, <hi>because that unto them was committed the Oracles of God.</hi> Certainly, he would not have called that the Chief, if Circumcision had been given in common, as a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith: However, when he is a treating of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges that come by Circumcision, surely he could not have forgotten this, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let not Men mistake themselves any more, for evident it is, that Circumcision, as 'tis called a Seal to <hi>Abraham,</hi> so it did not seal to him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which he then had not, but might have; but it did seal, really, and truly, the Righteousness of that Faith, which he at that time had: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you Baptize Children, who before they are Baptized, do truly believe; no body will be dispeased with you, or if you can prove, your Infants have really and truly such a Faith as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, and that their Baptism doth seal that Faith to them for Righteousness, which Circumcision sealed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> you do your business: But Sirs, pray what Blessings of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, doth Baptism now seal to your Infants? <hi>O, says one, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is theirs, it belongs to them, and shall we deny them the Seal? what, not let them have a bit of Wax?</hi> But stay a little, you must first prove the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, doth indeed belong to Believers Children as such, before you talk at such a rate as you do. A Seal, all Men know, makes firm and sure all the Blessings to the Person, to whom it is sealed, which are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the same Covenant, to which it is fixed: Therefore, take heed you do not blind the Minds of People, and deceive them, by making them think they are in Covenant, when indeed it may be no such thing.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Besides, if Circumcision was the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, then it would follow, that the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> is Abrogated; for the breaking off the Seal, all Men know, cancells the Covenant, and makes it of none Effect: And that Circumcision, which you call the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, that was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> is broke off, or torn off by the Death of Jesus Christ, is evident (And this proves, if it was a Seal of the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, which I say, not but only a Sign) that Covenant is gone, because the Seal is broken off.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64346:8"/>8. Circumcision was so far from being a Seal of the Covenant of Grace to all, to whom it did b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>long, that it sealed not all those outward Blessings to the Bond-men, or such who were bought with Money, and so were admitted to dwell in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family; for it did not seal to them all the outward and external Privileges of the Commonwealth of <hi>Israel</hi>; for they only belonged to those who were natural Israelites.</p>
            <p>Now, from the whole, it seems to me to be a strange Thing, which is lately asserted, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That the Infant Seed of Believers, (during their Infancy) have all of them a certain Interest in the Covenant of Grace: By vertue of which, they are compleatly Justified before God, from the Guilt of Original Sin, both Originans, and Originations; and yet, when they come to Years of Discretion, may (yea must) by their actual closing with, or refusing the Terms of the Covenant, either obtain the continuation, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their Covenant Interest, or be utterly, and finally cut off from it, and so perish Eternally in their Ignorance of God, and Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> To which I must say, That they seem to make the Covenant of Grace, such a Conditional Covenant, that renders it in Nature and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, like the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, or Covenant of Works, <hi>i. e.</hi> If they perform the Righteousness required, they shall live; if they Obey not, or make not Good, this pretended Covenant of Grace, they shall dye, or be cut off: Let our Brethren, who are sound in the Doctrine of Free-Grace, consider this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as the Promises of the New Covenant, will admit of no such partial Interest, (saith a Learned Author) so neither can this Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with the <hi>Analogy of Faith,</hi> in other Respects; for either the stain of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Sin, in these Infanrs is purged, and the dominion of Concupiscence in them destroyed, when their Guilt is pardoned, or it is not; if it be, then the Case of these Infants, in point of Perseverance, is the same with Adult Persons, that are under Grace, by actual Faith; and then a final A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy, from the Grace of the New Covenant, must be allowed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the one, as well as the other, notwithstanding all Provisions of that Covenant, and Engagement of God therein, to make the Promise <hi>sure to all the Seed, Rom.</hi> 4.16.</p>
            <p>But this the Author will not admit: If he say, That their Guilt is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but their Natures are not changed, or renewed, nor the Power of Original Corruption destroyed, so as that Sin, shall not have Dominion over them; it will be replyed, That then, notwithstanding their supposed Pardon, they remain as an unclean Thing, and so uncapable of admission into the Kingdom of God. Thus this worthy Author.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To which let me add, Certainly if Divine Habits were in those Infants, they would immediately be manifested; or be sure when they are grown up, would appear in them by gracious Operations flowing from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64346:8"/>
thence: But since those Acts, or Products of such a gracious Habit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not in them, 'tis evident, they never had them infused.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All that are in the Covenant of Grace, (if they live) the Fruits of Faith and Holiness, will flow naturally from those sacred Habits, God hath by his spirit planted in them, as <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>light</hi> doth from the Fire, when 'tis kindled on the Hearth. The Truth is, such who are united to Christ, and have Faith in him, and so are actually in the Covenant of Grace, are also washed and purged from Sin, and Pollution, see <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. None can have Union with Christ, but by the in-dwelling of the Holy Spirit; and wheresoever the Spirit of Christ is, it applies, The Blood of the Covenant, not only for Pardon, but also for the <hi>purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conscience from dead Works, to serve the living God</hi>:
<q>And therefore, (as the same Learned Author observes) as certain as any derive a New Covenant Rite from Christ for Pardon, they also receive a <hi>vital Influence</hi> from him, for the renovation of their Natures, and conforming their Souls to his Image: Therefore, to assert, That the Grace of Christ, is applied to some, for remission of Sins only, or that the guilt of any Sin, can be pardoned to any Person, and yet that Sin retains its Dominion over them, is a Doctrine, I understand, not to be sound, or agreeable to the <hi>Doctrine that is according to Godliness.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. To conclude with this, 'tis evident, these Men must, by their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, make every believing Parent to be (considered in respect of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham</hi>) a common Head and Father, not only to his own natural Seed, but to all Believers also, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and then it would follow, that there are as many common Fathers, like as <hi>Abraham</hi> was so called, as there are believing Men in the World, and so <hi>a knowing, or knowledge of Men still after the Flesh,</hi> which the Apostle disclaims, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. Besides, the Thing is usurp'd in it self: Therefore, let all know, That a Believers Right to the Blessings of the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, or by vertue of that Promise made with him, do relate to such a Seed as do believe, and not as Co-ordinate with him, in Covenant Interest; they are not each one, by this Covenant, made the Father of a Blessed Seed, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>the Father of the Faithful,</hi> neither can they claim the Promise for themselves, and their Seed, according to the Tenour of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, as he might, (as this Author observes) but they must believe as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, or have a Faith of their own: <hi>For if ye be Christ's, then are ye</hi> Abraham<hi>'s seed and heirs according to the Promise,</hi> Gal. 3 29. This the same Author notes.</p>
            <p>Obj. 7. The <hi>Covenant</hi> of Circumcision, <hi>was an Everlasting Covenant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the Covenant of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I Answer, 'Tis not unknown to our Opponants, that the <hi>Hebrew Word,</hi> for <hi>Everlasting,</hi> sometimes signifies no more then a long continuance. of time.— And so extensive was the Promise of God's peculiar Favours
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64346:9"/>
to the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the original of their Claim there-from that the severity of that Law afterwards given to them, was so far restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that (notwithstanding their manifold breach of Covenant with God, and forfeiture of all legal Claim of their Right and Privileges in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> thereby) that they were never utterly cut off from that good Land, and ceased, to be a peculiar People unto God, untill the end or period of that time, determined by the Almighty, was fully come; which was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealation of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and the setting up his spiritual Temple, under the Dispensation of the Gospel; and thus far, the Word <hi>Everlasting</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. 'Tis said, God promised to give the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his Seed for ever; and again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8. for an everlasting Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; whereas it is evident, they have for many Ages, been dispossessed of it: Nor may this seem strange, if we consult other Texts, where the same Terms are used with the like Restriction; for the Priesthood of <hi>Levi,</hi> is called an Everlasting Priesthood, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.13. And the Gates of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Everlasting Doors, <hi>Psal.</hi> 24.6. so the Statute, to make an Atonement for the Holy Sanctuary, and for the Tabernacle, and for the Altar, and for the Priests, and for all the People of the Congregation, is called, an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Statute, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.34. <hi>And this shall be for an everlasting statute,</hi> &amp;c. So that from hence 'tis very clear, that the Word <hi>Everlasting</hi> is to be taken sometimes with Restriction, and referrs to the end of that Dispensation, to which the Law, Statute, or Covenant did belong; and when Christ came, as all <hi>Mosaical</hi> Rites ended, so did the Covenant of Circumcision also.</p>
            <p>God never said, he would be the God of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed as such, as he gave himself to him, and to all his true spiritual Seed; for to them he gives himself, or an Interest in all God is, or has (so far as communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative) even for ever and ever, or to all Eternity; the Covenant of Grace, being <hi>ordered in all things, and sure,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. 'Tis impossible this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and Covenant Blessings, which is comprehensive of all Grace here, and Glory hereafter, should referr to a certain Period of time; and since he was not thus in Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s carnal Seed as such, 'tis evident, the Covenant of Circumcision, (tho' called, an Everlasting Covenant) was not the Covenant of Grace. And so much to this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Obj. <hi>There was never but one Covenant of Works, and that God made with</hi> Adam, <hi>and in him with all his Post<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, Our Controversie, lies not so much about, the Covenant of Works, as given to <hi>Adam,</hi> but about the Nature of <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, since Circumcision appears to be of the same Nature with that: I do not say, in every respect, there is no difference between the Covenant of Works made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and that made with the Peop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> differ not Essentially in Substance, 'tis all one and the same Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Requiring compleat and perfect Righteousness.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:64346:9"/>2. Therefore, tho' there is but one Covenant of Works, yet there was more than one Addition, or Administration of the said Covenant: This is evident, although given upon a different end, purpose, and design, by the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant, I grant, had one end and design, and the <hi>Sinai</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works had another; yet, may be, both, as to the Essence and Substance of them but one and the same Covenant: Which, doubtless, is all Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> intends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant had Happiness, and Justification in it, by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience thereto; and he being able, in the time of his Innocency, to keep it, he was thereby Justified.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But the Second Edition, or Ministration of the Covenant of Works, given to the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> tho' in its Nature and Quality, it was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, and one with the former, yet it was not given for Life or to Justifie them, nor was it able so to do, by reason of their Weakness through the Flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. But it was added because of Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To restrain Sin, (or as I said before) to regulate their Lives under those external Covenant Transactions of God with them, as his People, as before expressed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To make Sin appear exceeding sinful.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To discover to them, what Righteousness it is God doth require, in order to the Justification of the Soul in his Sight.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To make known to them thereby, what a Righteousness Man, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, in the First <hi>Adam,</hi> had, and lost; and</p>

            <p>Take what the Learned <hi>Bishop Usher</hi> hath said about the Law, as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>How doth this Covenant</hi> (i. e. <hi>The Covenant of Grace</hi>) <hi>differ from that of Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi>
               <q>His Answer is much every way, for first, in many Points, the Law may be conceived, by Reason; but the Gospel, in all Points, is far above the reach of Man's Reason. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Law commandeth to do good, and giveth no strength; the Gospel enableth us to do good, the Holy Ghost writing the Law in our Hearts. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Law promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Life only, the Gospel Righteousness also. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red perfect Obedience, the Gospel, the Righteousness of Faith. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Law revealeth Sin, rebuketh us for Sin, and leaves us in it, but the Gospel doth reveal unto us Remission of Sins, and freeth us from the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment belonging thereunto. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Law is the ministration of Wrath, Condemnation, and Death; the Gospel is a ministry of Grace, Justification, and Life. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Law was grounded on Man's own Righteousness, requiring of every Man, in his own Person, perfect Obedience, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. And in default, for satisfaction, everlasting Punishment, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 12. But the Gospel is grounded on the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ, admitting Payment and Performance in another, in behalf of so many as receive it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.14.</q>
               <hi>Bishop Usher's Summ and Substance of Christian Religion,</hi> p. 159. A multitude of <hi>Protestant Writers,</hi> I might produce, who all assert the same Doctrine.</p>
            <p>And if the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> was not a Covenant of Works, Why do all our Brethren say, as it was a Covenant of Works, 'tis <hi>done away</hi>? and, Why doth the Apostle say, Christ is the end of the Law, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteousness? It is not abolished, or done away, as 'tis a Rule of Righteousness, for as so it abides, as a perpetual Rule and Law to us.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I wonder at Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi>'s Out-crys against Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> as if it was impossible for the Saints to be under the Covenant of Works, under
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64346:10"/>
the former Dispensation, and yet in the Covenant of Grace; for I would know, Whether or not, they were not, at that time, under the Ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Covenant? but what, tho' no sooner did they believe in Christ, <hi>the Promised Seed,</hi> but they were delivered from the Curse of the Law. Nor is this any strange Thing, For are not all now, in these Days, under the Dispensation of the Gospel? yet, untill Men and Women believe in Christ, they abide still under the Curse of the Law of the First Covenant; for Christ is not the end of the Law to all the World, (so as some erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neously assert, <hi>i. e.</hi> all are justified in God's sight, from the Curse of the Law) but he is only <hi>the end of the Law, touching Righteousness to every one that beleiveth,</hi> to them, and to no other Adult Person: Therefore Men might be under the outward Dispensation of the Law of Works, and yet through Faith, be Justified; and also, others may be, and are now, under the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the Gospel; and yet, for not believing in Christ, be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and under the Curse of the Law: For the Gospel is not the Cause of our Sickness, but our Cure; none believing, is the refusal of the Medicine: So that there's no Reason for him to say, (because we assert this)
<q>That the Godly, under that Dispensation, hung mid-way, betwixt Life, and Death, Justification, and Condemnation; and after Death, mid-way betwixt Heaven, and Hell, p. 180.</q>
Therefore, as all that lived under the Dispensation of the Law, or Covenant of Works, were saved by Faith, in the Promise of Christ, or by the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Abraham</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>saw my Day, and was glad,</hi> so without Faith, or Interest in Christ, such that live under the Dispensation of the Gospel, cannot be saved; nor are they delivered from the Curse of the Law, or Covenant of Works. Therefore, (to conclude with this,) 'tis evident, the Covenant of Works, though but one, (as to the substance of it) yet there was several Ministrations of it; as it was given also upon different Ends, and Designs by the Lord: And therefore, because the said Covenant of Works was first given to <hi>Adam,</hi> (by vertue of which he was accepted, and justified in his Innocency) Could not God give forth a Second <hi>Addition, Ministration,</hi> or <hi>Transcript</hi> of his Righteousness, and Holy Law, requiring perfect Obedience, though not to Justification, yet to aggravate their Sin, and so to their just Condemnation? And doth not the Apostle assert the same Thing? <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, 20. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. But saith Bishop <hi>Usher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Doth not God wrong to Men, to require of him, that he is not able to perform?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He Answers
<q>No; for God made Man so, that he might have performed it; but he, by Sin, spoiled himself, and Posterity of those Gifts.</q>
Therefore,</p>
            <p>To proceed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I do affirm, That always, generally, when the Apostle speaks of the Old Covenant, or Covenant of Works, he passes by, in silence,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64346:11"/>
the Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and more immediately, and directly, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it unto the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, and to that of Circumcision, as all care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Readers, who read the Epistles to the <hi>Romans, Galatians,</hi> and to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> may clearly find.</p>
            <p>And farther, to evince the Truth we contend for; 'tis evident, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is (and ever was) but one Covenant of Grace, yet nothing is more plain then that there were several distinct Additions of it, altho' we say, the Promise or Gospel Covenant, was one and the same, in all Ages, in respect of the Things promised, with the Nature and Quality thereof; which is a free and absolute Covenant, without Works, or Conditions of foreseen Acts of Obedience, or Righteousness done, by the Creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5.</p>
            <p>The Substance, and Essential Part of this Gospel Covenant, as to the Promises of it, is Christ, Faith, a New Heart, Regeneration, Remission of Sins, Sanctification, Perseverance, and everlasting Life: Yet, this Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Covenant, had divers Forms, Additions, or Transcripts of it, which signified those Things, and the various Sanctions, by which it was given forth, and confirmed.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Adam,</hi> the Promise of it was under the Name Of the Seed of the Woman, bruising the Head of the Serpent. To <hi>Enoch, Noah,</hi> &amp;c. in other Terms. To <hi>Abraham,</hi> under the Name of <hi>His Seed, in whom all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth should be blessed.</hi> To <hi>Moses,</hi> by the Name of <hi>A great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet among his Brethren</hi>; and it was signified also unto him under dark Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and Sacrifices. Unto <hi>David,</hi> under the Name of <hi>A Successour in his Kingdom.</hi> To other Prophets, more clearer still made known, <hi>Unto as a Child is born; a Woman shall compass a Man; a New Covenant I will make,</hi> &amp;c In the New Testament, in plain Words, <hi>We all, with open face, beholding, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18.</p>
            <p>But now, because there were so many Additions, or Ministrations of the Gospel, or New Covenant, Doth it follow, there are so many New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants? This being so, Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> hath done nothing to remove Mr. <hi>Cary</hi>'s Arguments, but they stand firm: For he says not, That the <hi>Sinai</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Covenant of Works, was ordained to justifie Mankind; nor was it possible it could, after a Man had sinned; and yet in its Nature, an absolute Covenant of Works, <hi>or do for Life,</hi> or Perish. The Man that doeth these Things, shall live in them.</p>
            <p>Obj. 9. <hi>Circumcision could not oblige the Iews, in its own Nature, to keep the whole Law, because</hi> Paul <hi>Circumcised</hi> Timothy: <hi>If, in the very Nature of the Act, it had bound</hi> Timothy <hi>to keep the Law for Iustification, how could it have been</hi> Paul's <hi>Liberty so to do? saith Mr.</hi> Flavel, <hi>which he asserts it was,</hi> Gal. 2.3, 4. p. 226.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That Circumcision did oblige the Jews to keep the whole Law, is evident, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. and, as I hinted before, our Learned Annotators, on the said place, speak the same Thing positively. Take more largely their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64346:11"/>
very Words:
<q>They were obliged to one Part of the Law; they must be obliged to all other Parts of it; besides, that Circumcision was an owning, and professing Subjection to the whole Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi>
               <q>But did not the Fathers then, by being Circumcised, acknowledge themselves Debtors to the Law? (<hi>he Answers</hi>) Yes, they did acknowledge themselves bound to the observation of it, and to endure (upon the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it) the Curse of it; but they were discharged from that Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by believing in Christ, who was made a Curse for them, that he might redeem them from the Curse of the Law.</q>
Thus <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But, as to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Circumcising <hi>Timothy,</hi> it was, when he knew Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was abolished; and therefore, it could not oblige him, <hi>Paul</hi> well knew, to keep the Law. Sith no Law, in its own Nature, can oblige any Person, according to the Nature, and Quality of it, when 'tis abrogated and in no force, tho' he saw it was his Liberty, for some Reasons to do it: But those Christians, corrupted by <hi>false Teachers,</hi> did not believe, That Circumcision, and other Legal Rites, were abolished, but that they were in full Force as ever; and therefore, he tells them, (granting it was, as they believed) if they were Circumcised, they were obliged to keep the whole Law, tho' his great Design was to take them off from seeking Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Works. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis evident, <hi>Paul</hi> did not Circumcise <hi>Timothy,</hi> in Obedience to the Law given by the Lord; but for other <hi>Politick</hi> Reasons, in complying with the weakness of some Jewish Christians: After the same manner he submitted to some other Rites also, of the Ceremonial Law, as <hi>shaving the head,</hi> and <hi>purifying himself,</hi> which was then also abolished, tho' not deadly, <hi>say Expositors,</hi> then though those Ceremonies, were dead, and so nothing in them, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.24. Circumcision was, alas! dead, and this <hi>Paul</hi> knew, therefore could not hurt <hi>Timothy</hi>: But those, to whom he wrote, thought it was alive; and therefore, it would not only hurt, but destroy them, or be destructive to them, upon the Account of the Obligation it lay them under, if it was as they conceived. This being so, What is become of Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi>'s Argument, which he makes such boast of, as if unanswerable? pag. 231.</p>
            <p>Obj. 10. <hi>The Root is Holy, therefore the Branches; that is, as</hi> Abraham <hi>was Holy, so were all his Seed; and as Believers are Holy, so are all their Children; and as the natural Branches of</hi> Abraham <hi>was broken off for their Unbelief, so the Gentiles are grafted in, in their stead, and succeed in their Privileges, and so their Seed are Holy, with an external relative Covenant Holiness,</hi> Rom. 11.16. <hi>and therefore, may be Baptized, and have Right to Church Membership.</hi>

<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Because Baptism is of mere positive Right, nothing but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Example, or some well grounded Authority from Christ, that can give them a Right thereto.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because the Gospel Church is not constituted, as the Jewish Church was, 'tis not National, but Congregational; it consisteth not of the carnal Seed as such, but only of the spiritual Seed, <hi>i. e.</hi> Adult Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who believe. Where do we find, in all the New Testament, That the Children of Believers as such, were Baptised, and taken into the Church, as being in an external relative Covenant? Holy Mr. <hi>Tho. Goodwin</hi> (as I find him quoted by a Learned Writer, in a Book called <hi>Two Treatises,</hi> p. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<q>In the New Testament, there is no other Holiness spoken of, but Personal, or Real, by Regeneration; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which, he challenged all the World, to shew to the contrary.</q>
I have shewed you, <hi>The Ax is laid at the Root</hi> of all <hi>external, relative, foederal, Holiness,</hi> which qualified under the Law, for Jewish Ordinances, and Church Membership.— But</item>

            <p n="3">3 We will now come to examine this Text of Holy Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. There are various Interpretations of what is meant by the Root in this place.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Some understand it of the Covenant.</hi>
               </item>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I now agree with the last, and say <hi>Abraham</hi> is the Root spoken of here: But pray observe, as he was a Two-fold Father, so he was a Two-fold Root: <hi>First,</hi> The Father, or Root of all that believe, <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Root of all his Natural Seed as such; but this place referrs to him as he was the Root of all his True spiritual Seed; and if so, the Holiness of the Branches is real, spiritual, and internal; (and not external foederal Holiness) for such, as is the Holiness of the Root (as meant here) such is the Holiness of the Branches; but <hi>Abraham</hi> was believingly, personally, spiritually, and internally Holy, <hi>Ergo,</hi> such are all the Branches spoken of here. And indeed, for want of Faith, and spiritual Holiness, that was in the Root. were many of the Natural Branches broken of, from being any more a People, in an external Covenant Relation with God; for this is the Covenant I have shewed, The Ax is now laid at the Root of, <hi>viz.</hi> the External Covenant. The Jews were broken off, or cut down by their Unbelief; their Old Church State, and Covenant being gone, they not believing in Christ, and so united to the <hi>True Olive,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by Faith, were grafted in; they having obtained the <hi>Fatness of the Root, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Faith, and Righteousness of</hi> Abraham, and of the Covenant of Grace made with him, <hi>who is called, The Father of all that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Learned Writer says,
<list>
                  <item>1.
<q>The Holiness here meant, is First, in respect of God's Election, <hi>i. e.</hi> Holiness, personal and inherent in God's intention.</q>
                  </item>
                  <item>2.
<q>It is also a Holiness, derivative, not from any Ancestors, but <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> not as a natural Father, but as a spiritual Father, or Father of the faithfull; and so derived from the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>From hence it appears, There is nothing in this illustrious Scripture, for what these Men bring it, who think hereby to prove a Holiness, which the New Testament knows nothing of; applying, <hi>the Holiness and Insection</hi> to outward Dispensation, only in the visible Church, which is meant of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace, in the invisible, and make every believing Parent, like Root to his Posterity with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to his Seed; which we deny.</p>
            <p>Let therefore the Jews Covenant, standing before they were broken off (from being any more a Covenant People) be what it would, I am sure no Gentile is graften into Christ, nor Jew neither, but by Faith; nor can any be grafted into the Gospel Church, without the Profession of such a Faith.</p>
            <p>The Jews, 'tis true, were broken off by their Unbelief, and were also now no more a Church; nor is there (as I said once before) any such kind of Church, constituted under the Gospel Dispensation, as theirs was, <hi>viz.</hi> A National one: For they, amongst the Jews, who were True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, (or the spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi>) who receiving Jesus Christ by Faith, were planted a new into the Gospel Church; and between them, and Gentile Believers, there is no difference, since the middle Wall of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition is broken down, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14. Jew, and Gentile, stand now by Faith, and not by external, relative Covenant Holiness. Thou standeth, (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) by Faith: O Believer! (mark it) not by Birth, Privileges, but by by Faith; (as worthy Mr. <hi>Gary</hi> observes)
<q>Thy standing is by Faith, yet not thy Seed by thy Faith, But thou thy self by thine; and they, by their own Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith is that, by which (thou standing, and not thy Seed) hast Right to stand in the Church, and not thy Seed; but if thy Seed have Faith, and thou hast none, then they have Right in this Church, and thou shalt be excluded. And, although under the Law, we deny not, but that the natural Seed, or Progeny of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were all Holy, with an External, Ceremonial, Typical Holiness; and consequently, they were then admitted to an external Participation of Church Privileges; yet now 'tis otherwise, <hi>Old things are passed away, and all things are become new</hi>; now we know no Man after the Flesh, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16, 17.</q>
That Old Church State is dissolved, and manner of Admission into it, by external Birth, Privileges, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64346:13"/>
and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; Having abolished in his flesh, even the law of commandments, contained in ordinances, for to make in himself, of twain, one new man, so making Peace,</hi> vers. 15.</p>
            <p>The Legal External Covenant made with the Jews, whilst it abode, was a Wall of Separation, or Partition between them, and the Gentiles, and caused Enmity in them both, in the Jews, because they contemned the Gentiles, as a People Unclean, and Abominable; not being Circumcised, they Hated them: And the poor Gentiles, they seeing themselves out of the Covenant, and so deemed <hi>Strangers and Foreigners, and without God in the</hi> World, they envied the Jews: But now Jesus Christ has broken down this Wall of Partition, and slain the Enmity that was between them, which was the Ceremonial Law, and Covenant of Circumcision, and all other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Privileges, as they were God's peculiar Covenant People, and these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abolished, and gone, now both Jew and Gentile are made one in Christ, and become one new Body, or Church, <hi>viz.</hi> A Christian Gospel Church: And hence he adds, <hi>And, that he might reconcile both unto God, in one body by the Cross,</hi> ver. 16. That is, The outward Wall of Jewish Rites, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges being gone, Christ thereby designed, to bring both Jew, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile (<hi>viz.</hi> all the Elect) unto God, and both into one Church State, no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor People now, having any external Privilege above others, by the Gospel Covenant: And if the Jews external Birth-Privileges, were a Wall of Partition between them, and the Gentiles, let Men take heed how they set up another like Wall of Partition among them, who are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and their Seed, and Unbelieving Gentiles, and their Seed, lest that prove a ground and cause of like Enmity between believing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Gentiles, as the Old Rites, and Covenant Privileges did, between Jews, and Gentiles.</p>
            <p>But to open that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. a little more fully, as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done, 'tis evident the Apostle, in the <hi>9th.</hi> and <hi>10th.</hi> Chapters to the <hi>Romans,</hi> is treating of the Election of Grace, and of the Covenant of Grace, God made with <hi>Abraham</hi>: These were his People which he had not cast away, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.1. And of this sort, God had 7000 in <hi>Elias</hi>'s Days, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Even so, saith he, at this present time also there is a remnant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the election of grace,</hi> ver. 5. Hence he says, What, <hi>then Israel hath not obtained,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but the Election hath obtained, and the rest were blinded,</hi> ver. 7. He farther shews, That abundance of the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were broken off, How were they broken off? Why, for their Unbelief; they not Receiving Christ, but Rejected Him, and the Gospel: And the New Church State were broken off; but that <hi>the Gentiles might not boast over them,</hi> the Apostle shews, There is ground left, to believe, all those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Election of Grace, shall, in God's due time, be brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and so partake of the Blessings of the Gospel Covenant, or Promise of Grace made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s spiritual Seed; and to prove this, he in <hi>ver.</hi> 16. lays down an Argument; <hi>For, if the First-fruits be Holy, the Lump is also Holy, and if the Root be Holy, so are the Branches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:64346:13"/>By the <hi>Root,</hi> I understand (as I said before) <hi>Abraham,</hi> is meant, <hi>Root,</hi> and Father, signifying here the same thing; <hi>Abraham</hi> being counted the <hi>Root,</hi> or <hi>Father,</hi> as God represents him, (not only of his own natural Off-spring) but of all that believe, or the <hi>Root</hi> of all his true, holy, and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Seed, and so intended here.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>First-fruits,</hi> may be meant, <hi>Isaac, Iacob,</hi> and all the Holy <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi> for they were given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the First-fruits of the Covenant of Grace, or Free Promise of God to him; and these were Holy, with a true, spiritual, personal, and inherent Holiness: Also,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By the <hi>Lump,</hi> may be meant, (and doubtless is) the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Elect, or spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> from the time the First fruits were given to him, untill the Gospel Days, or <hi>whole Lump</hi> of <hi>God's true Israel,</hi> who also were all Holy as the <hi>Root,</hi> and <hi>First-fruits,</hi> were Holy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> by the Branches, he means, the true spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the Elect Seed, that then were living at that present time, as <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Even so then, at this present time also, there is a remnant, according to the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Grace.</hi> And these were Holy likewise, even as all the rest, both as the <hi>Root; First-fruits,</hi> and <hi>Lump,</hi> or whole Body were Holy; that is, all the the spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were like himself, <hi>viz.</hi> Holy, in a Gospel Sense, with a personal and inherent Holiness. Now observe, he speaks of some Branches that were broken off, these seemed to be Branches, or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham</hi>: And so they were according to the Flesh; (but were <hi>like those Branches in Christ, who bear no Fruit,</hi> Joh. 15.2, 3, 4. and <hi>therefore taken away</hi>) he alludes, to the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom he stood, not, as a spiritual Father, or <hi>Root,</hi> but as a natural, and legal Father, as they were a National Church, and sprang from him as such, to whom the external legal Covenant was made; and these as such, for rejecting of Christ, were broken off, (1.) Not broken off from the Election of Grace, for to that they did not belong. (2.) Nor were they broken off of the Gospel Church, for they never were grafted into that: but (3<hi>dly,</hi>) they were broken off from being any more a Church, or People, in Covenant with God, the whole Old Church State, and Constitution, being gone, by the coming in of the Gospel Dispensation, and they not closing in with Christ, in the Covenant of Grace, and Gospel Church, but utterly reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him, and the New Church State: For this they were broken off as a lost People, because not re-planted, or implanted into Jesus Christ, and the true Gospel Church, the Old being gone, quite rased, and taken away: They have now no <hi>Root</hi> to stand upon, having lost their Legal standing, and Privileges, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was their Father, upon that very Foot of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and they not appearing to be the true Branches, or Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as he was the Father of all the Faithful, or of all the Elect Seed, they must, of necessity, from hence be broken off, from being the People of God, or belonging to any Common Head, or Root, in any Covenant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God, at all: The Dispensation being changed, the Old House
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64346:14"/>
pulled down <hi>Agar,</hi> and <hi>her Son,</hi> cast out. <hi>Old things past away, and all things being now, become New.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this New State, New Blessings, and New Church Privileges they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and so were the natural Branches broken off, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (<hi>who were wild by Nature,</hi> that is, never were in any visible Covenant State with God, nor, in any sense, related to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a Root) were grafted into the <hi>True Olive,</hi> Jesus Christ, and into the Gospel Church and so Partakers of the sap and fatness of the Root, and of the Olive, that is, of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Blessings of Christ, and of the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and Privileges of the Gospel Church; and this they received, and partook of us, as being first grafted by saving Faith in Christ, and so united to his Mystical Body. But since there are a great Number of the natural Branches, that are beloved for their Father's sake, that is, for their Father <hi>Abraham</hi>'s sake, as the Root, and Father of all the Elect Seed, they shall, in due time, be grafted in again, and so become a People visibly owned of God, and in Covenant with him, as the True Seed now actually are, and formerly were.</p>
            <p>And if this be considered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What doth this Text do, to prove the natural Seed of Believers are in the Gospel Covenant, or are externally, relatively, and foederally Holy; for if the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> can lay no claim, nor have any Right to Gospel Precepts, or Privileges as such, but are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, What ground is there for us, to think within our selves, that we, or our natural Off-spring, as such, should be taken in, and so another Wall of Partition, and cause of Enmity, set up between believing, and unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentiles, and their Seed as such?</p>
            <p>The Apostle speaks, not of Branches, or of being Holy with an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, relative Covenant Holiness, but of such a spiritual Gospel Holiness that was in the Root, <hi>viz. Abraham,</hi> who <hi>believed in God, and it was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him for Righteousness</hi>: And thus, all his true spiritual Seed, who are actual Branches and in Covenant are Holy, and also, all the Elect of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> not yet called, are discretively Holy, or in God's sight so, <hi>who calls things that are not, as if they were</hi>; they are all Holy in his Account, and <hi>bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for their Father's sake,</hi> with whom the Covenant of Grace was made for himself, and all his spiritual Seed: And 'tis from this Argument, the Apostle argues, for the calling of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and grafting them in, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Election of Grace. —</p>
            <p>Therefore, there is no ground for <hi>Infants Church Membership,</hi> or <hi>Baptism,</hi> from hence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and those who make every Believer a common Head, or Root of their natural Off-spring, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, either way, know not what they affirm, nor what they say: see <hi>Rector Rectified.</hi> Moreover, the Jews, who were broken off, are still the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi>; and if therefore, this Holiness was an external, relative, foederal Holiness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are still in that Sense Holy, as far forth as any Child of believing Gentiles as such, can be said to be; but, 'tis evident, this is not that Holiness, of

            <p>Minister's Sons had all a Right to the Ministry, they had a Right to the Tenths of all their Brethren's Increase and first Fruits, and a multitude of other Advantages besides, <hi>viz.</hi> they had <hi>a Civil Government</hi> of their own, <hi>Power</hi> to punish Capital Offenders with Death; their Temporal Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were among themselves, but Christ hath not set up such a Gospel po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Church-State, nor given such Power and such a Government to his Church under the Gospel: what will be in the Kingdom of Christ in the last days we know not.</p>

                  </gap> Covenant of Works, or Condition of it.</hi> (<hi>to this purpose Mr.</hi> Flavel <hi>speaks,</hi> pag. 231.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, though it should be granted, that Circumcision had such an End, yet that, that was the direct and primary End of it, he proves not; for the direct and more immediate End and Design thereof (we have proved) was something else, although we grant it was a dark Sign, Type or Figure of that they speak of, <hi>viz.</hi> to discover the Corruption of Nature by sin, and the Mortification thereof, and so also did most of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Law: but doth it therefore follow, those Ceremonies (and so Circumcision) did not appertain to that Ministration of the Covenant of Works God gave by <hi>Moses</hi> to the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> which is abrogated and done away. Must the Shadow or Sign be part of the Substance, or belong, or appertain to the Substance?</p>
            <p>Wherefore, (as Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> well saith,) until they can prove the <hi>Sinai Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> &amp;c. not to be in their own Nature a Covenant of Works, this which they object here, has nothing in it; since <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> the <hi>Passover, &amp;c.</hi> as well as <hi>Circumcision,</hi> were <hi>Types of Christ,</hi> and other <hi>Gospel-Mysteries</hi> likewise: and indeed Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> seems to me to run upon a Mistake all along in his Answer to Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> as if the latter makes no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant of Works, and those after Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the same Old Covenant: for Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> I am satisfied, means no more than what I have said, <hi>viz.</hi> That they agree in Nature and Quality, tho' <hi>Adam</hi> had Life and Justification by his own perfect Obedience unto that Law or Covenant, while he stood, and it was given to him to that end; yet God gave not the <hi>Sinai Covenant, which required perfect Obedience,</hi> to the end Man might be thereby justified; nor was it possible he could, since he had sinned, and lost his power to obey: but that Law contains a clear Transcript of the first Law, and so of the Holiness of God, and of that Righteousness Man originally had, and lost; and of the Impossibility of his being justified, without such a compleat and perfect Righteousness: but the Law as written in the two Tables, was given in Mercy (upon the Score or Account I have mentioned) to <hi>Israel,</hi> in Subserviency to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and to it was annexed the Ceremonies, to shew that a plenary Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction must be made for the breach of God's Holy Law, and that this must be by Blood, <hi>tho' not by blood of Bulls or Goats,</hi> but they might have
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64346:15"/>
understood, that by them, the Sacrifice and Blood of Christ was figured, could they have seen to the end, or purport of them.</p>
            <p>Therefore the true Distinction lies here, <hi>viz.</hi> Both are the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works; both shew Man must live, and sin not, if he would be justified in God's sight: the first in Man's Innocency, answered the end of a Covenant of Works; the second Administration thereof could not give Life, nor was it given to that end, but it answered the end for which God gave it: and so much to this Objection.</p>
            <p>Obj. 13. <hi>You cannot deny, but Circumcision sealed the Righteousness of Faith to</hi> Abraham, <hi>and how can you prove a Seal of the Covenant of Works can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to such a use and service? Thus Mr.</hi> Flavel, p. 234.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I answer first, who of us say that Circumcision was a Seal of the Covenant of Works? there is a great difference between a Seal of a Covenant, and that which was given as a Sign or Token of that legal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Covenant God made with all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed as such, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d that Circumcision was such a Sign we have before shewed; as also of their having the Covenant or Law of <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and <hi>Land of Canaan</hi> given to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But that Circumcision was a Seal of that Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> himself had, (not being yet Circumcised) and that he should be the Father of all that believe, <hi>Paul</hi> possibly affirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. and yet it might well be of use to him also, as a Sign or Token of those other Covenant Rights and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings granted to his natural Off-spring, is evident.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And from hence we have proved, that Circumcision could not be so, a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith to any other Person or Persons, none having the like Faith before they were Circumcised, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had; nor were they made common Fathers to all true Believers, whether <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. 14. <hi>Where the Covenant of Circumcision is by the Apostle contra-distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished to the Covenant of Faith,</hi> Rom. 4.13. <hi>the Law in that place, is put strictly for the pure Law of Nature, and metatypically signified the Works of the Law,</hi> p. 235.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I suppose no Man besides Mr. <hi>Flavel,</hi> ever asserted such a thing as this is: I would know how Circumcision (a meer positive Precept) came to be a part of the Pure Law of Nature? for 'tis evident, that the Law <hi>Paul</hi> contra-distinguisheth from the Righteousness of Faith, had Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision in it, or else the same Apostle needed not to have taken such pains to have distinguished between Circumcision and the Righteousness of Faith; and had Circumcision appertained to the Righteousness of Faith, or been a Gospel Covenant, why doth he exclude it with the Law from being so counted? read <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Law therefore, of which the Apostle speaks, is that Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law given to <hi>Israel,</hi> of which Circumcision was part, and so
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64346:16"/>
of the like Nature and Quality with it; and both contra-distinguished to the Covenant of Grace, or to the Righteousness of Faith.</p>
            <p>And that the Law here is put strictly for the pure Law of Nature, is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without Reason, Proof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Demonstration; what Law doth the Apostle speak of in the preceding Chapters, and also in this, see <hi>chap.</hi> 3.1, 2. is it not that he calls the Oracles of God, or <hi>Lively Oracles, Act.</hi> 7.38. given on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>? The Law of Nature, and the written Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the two Tables<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are all one and the same Law; as to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of them, they are materially the same, tho' not formally; both convinced of Sin, both bring Sinners under Guilt and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so <hi>that all Mouths may be stopped, and all the World become guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,</hi> Rom. 3 19. both are a Rule to walk by, both Witnesses for God, but neither of them can give Life, nor justifie the Sinner in the sight of God, <hi>v.</hi> 20. Therefore neither of them are any part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, for if one of them is a part of it, both of them are; if the Law of Nature be not so, the Law written in the Tables of Stone was not so: yet the <hi>Iews</hi> had the Advantage of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> because their Law was wrote in far more legible Characters than the dimm Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. as well as in many other respects.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.

of the Gospel are less than the Privileges of the <hi>Iews</hi> under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works; which I have already answered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His mentioning that Passage of <hi>Calvin,</hi> is remote to his purpose, he speaks of the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> not of the Covenant of Works, which we say is not curtail'd by Christ's coming, but is every way as extensive now, as it was from the beginning: but we have proved that there was a Two-fold Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision did appertain to his Natural Seed as such, and so part of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Covenant.</p>
            <p>Obj <hi>But the Commission,</hi> Mat. 28.19. (you say) <hi>is as full, or rather more beneficial and extensive than the Covenant of Works; and consequently, that the baptizing of Infants is a Christian Duty; for had there been as general a Commission given by</hi> Moses <hi>to Twelve Elders of</hi> Israel, <hi>as the Blessed Iesus gave to his Disciples, and it had been said to them, Go teach all Nations, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising them; this had been no Prohibition to Circumcise the Iewish Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Is this <hi>that the Mountains have brought forth</hi>? we were big in Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation by your Title Page, wondering what new Notion or Arguments you had found out, from the Commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. or what your different Method should be to prove Infant Baptism — But truly Sir, the Log is still too heavy, you cannot lift it up — I see nothing new in your whole Tract, nor any thing but what has been answered; but this being the main Pin upon which all hangs, I shall give a brief Reply to you.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. I thank you for your plain and just Concession; I see you conclude and grant Circumcision did belong to the Covenants or Works: I doubt not, but you are right so far<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with that, your Cause is gone, and <hi>Calvin</hi> and all that came after him, have said nothing in calling Circumcision a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Covenant.</item>
               <item>2. But Sir, suppose the People of <hi>Israel</hi> had never been commanded by the Lord to Circumcise their Children till <hi>Moses</hi> came, and <hi>Moses</hi> had given such a Commission that you mention, <hi>viz. to teach all Nations, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising them</hi>; do you think they would have had ground from thence to have circumcised their Infants? whereas his Circumcision required the teaching of all Nations first, before they were circumcised, of which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were not capable.</item>
               <item>3. 'Tis evident, that our Saviour in his Great Commission, enjoineth no more to be baptized, but such who are first taught or made Disciples, and this agrees with his own Practice, Joh. 4.1. <hi>he made and baptized more Disciples than</hi> John: he first made them Disciples, and then baptized them; nor were there any baptized in the New Testament, but such who first professed Faith in the Lord Jesus. See our Answer to <hi>Mr. Burkit,</hi> (which I sent you.) Also our Answer to the <hi>Athenian Society,</hi> this is there fully spoken unto.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:64346:17"/>4. If the Commission be so extensive, as you intimate, Why do you not go, (or stir up some Ministers to go) into all Heathen, and Pagan Nations, and Baptise them, and their Children; and so that way, make them all Christians: You may teach them the Christian Doctrine, <hi>i. e.</hi> Faith and Repentance, afterwards, as you do your Children; but the Truth is, there is no need to teach them afterwards, the way of Faith, and Regeneration, (if your Doctrine be true) because the chief Thing they received in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, you say, is <hi>divine Grace,</hi> viz. <hi>Regeneration, Adoption,</hi> and <hi>a Title to the Inheritance of eternal Life,</hi> p. 20. Sure those divine Habits can never be lost. Reader, take what this Man says farther on this Respect.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But you say, we neither regard, nor consider the chief Thing in Baptism,</hi> viz. <hi>The Testification, or Witness of the divine Benevolence, taking them into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Protection, and Patronage, and conferring, and bestowing Grace upon them; for, in Baptism, the chief Thing is divine Grace, which consists, and stands in the remission, pardon, and forgiveness of Sins; in Adoption, or Sonship, and in a Right, and Title to the Inheritance of Eternal Life, of which Grace, Infants stand in need, and are as capable as the Adult,</hi> &amp;c. p. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is such Doctrine, that few <hi>Paedo-Baptists,</hi> besides your self, do assert, or believe; but, What Proof do you give us to confirm it, from God's Word? You say right, we do not regard it indeed — Doth Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism do all this?— 'Tis wonderful: How! conferr Grace, and give Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and Eternal Life!— You Ministers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if this be so, can do as strange things, as the <hi>Popish Priests</hi> in Transubstantiation; you can, by sprinkling a little Water on the Face of a Babe, it appears, change the <hi>evil,</hi> and <hi>vitious</hi> Habits, <hi>form Christ in the Soul, raise the Dead to Life, and of a Child of Wrath, make a Child of God.</hi> It grieves me to think, a Man called a Minister of the Gospel, should teach such corrupt Doctrine, and deceive the Ignorant.</p>
            <p>For, as it is without Scripture-Evidence, nay contrary to it; for God's Word, that tells us, <hi>Baptism washes not away the Filth of the Flesh,</hi> that is, the Corruption of depraved Nature; so 'tis contrary to Reason, and without any rational Demonstration, as <hi>Reverend Stephen Charnock,</hi> (tho' a Paedo-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,) shews,
<q>Many Men <hi>(saith he)</hi> take Baptism for Regeneration: The Ancients usually give it this Term; one calls our Saviour's Baptism, his Regeneration. This conferrs not Grace, but engageth to it; outward Water cannot convey inward Life.</q>
How can Water, an external Thing, work upon the Soul, in a Physical manner? neither can it be proved,
<q>That ever the Spirit of God, is tyed by any Promise, to apply himself to the Soul, in gracious Opperations, when Water is applyed to the Body. If it were so, that all that were Baptised, were Regenerated, then all that were Baptised, should be saved, or e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Charnock on Regen.</hi> p. 75. Sir, Do but prove what you here affirm, and I will write no more against Infant-Baptism; and till that's done, all you say is nothing, in my Judgment.</p>
            <p>But to proceed: Such a Commission you speak of, would not, in your sense, Authorize those Twelve <hi>Elders of</hi> Israel, <hi>to go, and Teach, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise</hi> the Jews, and their Children only, but all others, in all Nations of the World; this would be an easie way of making People Christians: But, Sir, The Gospel, whatsoever you think, according to our Doctrine, is more extensive, then was the Law to the Jews; for that was restrained to that People. <hi>He sheweth his word unto Iacob, his statutes, and judgments to Israel: He hath not dealt so with any nation, for his judgments they have not known them,</hi> Psal. 147.19, 20. But the Gospel is not restrained, or limited to any one particular People, or Nation, but it is to be preached <hi>to all the World</hi>; and, whosoever are made Disciples, <hi>i. e. Do believe, and are baptised, shall be saved,</hi> Mark. 16.16 (Not that we suppose, Men can't be saved without Baptism; for that makes no Person a Christian, or a Disciple of Christ, neither Young, nor Old, though 'tis the Duty of Believers, to submit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.)</p>
            <p>We doubt not, but that the same spiritual, and eternal Blessings, which the Jewish dying Infants had, by the Death, and Merits of Christ then, the dying Infants of Christians have now, according to the Election of Grace: But as touching the legal and external Privileges of the Jews, we have proved (in this Tract, and elsewhere) that they had many more, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers respects, under the Law, than those, we Christians, and our Children, have under the Gospel.</p>
            <p>As to those great Advantages, Blessings, and Privileges of the Covenant of Works, which you talk of, I wonder what they were; for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works could not give Life, no Justification, nor Righteousness (that could) save by that Covenant, no pardon of Sin; but, contrarywise, Death, Wrath, and the Curse, is denounced upon every Soul of Man, for the breach of it. How vain then are your Arguments? in the Gospel is Life, is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, is Pardon of Sin, to every Man that believeth; <hi>To the Iew first, and also to the Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 1.16. Time would fail me, to sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd your Notions are, to what almost all our Learned Protestant Divines, have wrote about the Covenant of Works. —</p>
            <p>The Jewish Infants received no Soul Spiritual, and Eternal Advantage by Circumcision: (What the chief Advantage, or Profit was which they h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d; and if so, What Benefit can any Infant receive by Baptism, (or rather Rantism) which is a mere humane Innovation? You confess, it was instituted by the Church, as a needful Thing, p. 37. And the Church hath Instituted it, because it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; it was indeed never Instituted, or Appointed by our Lord Jesus: And,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64346:18"/>
as to that Custom among the Jews, (you speak of) p. 7, 8 of their Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Proselytes, I have fully Answer'd it, in my Treaty, called, <hi>The Rector Rectified,</hi> p. 24, 25. and in my Answer, to the <hi>Athenian</hi> Society. Sir, you go upon a Mistake all along, taking it for granted, That Circumcision, and other legal Rites, were great spiritual Privileges; for 'tis no such Thing: It was a Yoke of Bondage, not to be born; and a great Mercy it was to them, that they were delivered from it, <hi>Act.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>5. And therefore the Jews, did they believe in Christ, and see the Nature of, and Tendency of Circumcision, would never speak after that manner as you mention, in p. 9. (<hi>Viz</hi>)</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>I will rather be a Iew, then a Christian, because, as soon as I own, and profess their Faith, my Child, after such a Declaration, is in covenant, as well as my self, and hath a Right to the Sign,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Sir, The Jewish Childrens Right to Circumcision, was not defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, till their Parents made a profession of Faith; but as they were the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as such, it was the Command of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that gave them that Right, and nothing else.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>So, that by this account, it plainly appears, That denying Infants Baptism, is an hindrance to the progress of the Holy Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> True, if Infant-Baptism doth make them Christians, you say right, it must follow, That the denying them Baptism, hinders the progress of the Gospel; but this is false which you assert: Baptism makes them not Christians; we say, none but Christ, by his Spirit, can Regenerate the Souls of Men, or make them Christians: True, you may thereby give them the Name of Christians, but can't give them the Nature of Christians; you may deceive them, and make them believe they were so made Christians, and thereby undoe them eternally, by relying upon a mere Cheat and Delusion: This is a way to make false Christians, counterfeit Christians. What a Christian is he, whose vile Nature was never changed? You would do well to get a great Number of Ministers, if Baptism does make Christians, (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) to go into the Heathen Nations, and Baptise them, and so make all the World Christians; but if you know no other way, for the progress of the Gospel, then this, of making Christians by Baptism, God deliver the World, from your way of Christianing the Nations.</p>
            <p>You will not see, That the Gospel Church is not National, but only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational; the Jewish Church, in that, differ'd from the Christian<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: For, What is more clearer than this? Christ's Church, is called, <hi>a Garden inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>; Christ's Flock, is <hi>a little Flock:</hi> Those who were added to the Church were separated, either from the Jewish People, or Heathen Nations, were commanded to <hi>separate themselves,</hi> and <hi>not to touch the unclean Thing. Ye are not, saith Christ, of the World.</hi> — You would make whole Nations the Church, and from the Commission, inferr such a false Conclusion. I have consider'd what you have said in p. 10, 11. Sir, When all the Pagan World are instructed, and believe in Christ, we will say, they have a Right to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64346:18"/>
Sign, <hi>i. e.</hi> Baptism — but not till then, hath one Soul a Right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: prove what you say, if you can, <hi>i. e.</hi> That the Children of Christians as such, are Christians, as the Children of <hi>Iews,</hi> were <hi>Iews</hi>: or, that Baptism makes any, either old, or young, True Christians, or regenerates their Souls: 'Tis not your bare Assertions, or your Saying it, that is worth any thing: what Authority have you from God's Word to affirm such things? you give no more proof for what you assert, than the Papists do for their vain Traditions and Popish Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; Grace must be implanted in the Soul before Baptism, or the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son has no Right to it, <hi>'tis an outward Sign of an inward spiritual Grace,</hi> as your Church asserts: Baptism is not Grace, nor conveys Grace, if you can prove it does, I will say no more, but submit and acknowledge my mistake: but if you err in saying it does, do not go about to deceive your People any more. — You plead for making false Christian, nominal Christians: Christianity is another thing than what you seem to imagine, <hi>The Way is narrow, and the Gate is straight,</hi> — Regeneration is a difficult Work, it requires the Mighty Power of God to be put forth on the Soul; nay, the same Power that God wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.19, 20. As to Infants being capable of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of the Gospel, so are <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> when God calls them, and infuses Grace into their Souls: I have answered all you say upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, in my Answer to Mr. <hi>Burkit.</hi> The Commission in the largest Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, comprehends no more than such that are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> disciplized by the Preaching of the Gospel in all Nations: the Parents must be discipled, and the Children must themselves in their own Persons be discipled, as well as their Parents; and as their Parents were before baptized; and when a whole Nation, both Parents and Children, are by the Word and Spirit, made Christ's true and holy Disciples, and as such baptized, then all the Nation may be look'd upon to be Christians: but we know what sort of Christians you make, and your national Church does consist of, that are made so by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, to our trouble; if God does not make your Members better Christians than your Sprinkling, or baptizing them (as you call it) hath done; none of them, (as it appears from Christ's own words, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3.) can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. In my former Books you may read Mr. <hi>Perkin</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Expositions of the Commission they talk; not at such a rate as you do; tho' <hi>Pedo-Baptists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho' in your late Letter to me, you seem to boast, as if some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire your Book, and that your Arguments are invincible, or unanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Yet that is not my Conceptions concerning it; and had your Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonist so judged of it, I doubt not but he would attempted your strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Fort before this time; for I know very well his Ability to defend this Cause: indeed I wonder at his silence.</p>
            <p>But if you do proceed to provoke a farther Answer, you may have
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64346:19"/>
it; — This which I have done, was occasioned by my Preaching on this Text; not intending a particular Reply to every thing you have said, nor is there any need; for you are fully answered already in our late Treatises: yet I think the Controversie much concerns you of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and such who are for a National Church.</p>
            <p>As for our Brethren, called Congregational, I cannot tell what they mean by contending for the Practice of <hi>Paedo-Baptism,</hi> nor do I well know what their Sentiments are about it: they agree (as I do understand) with us (and other Christians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) that Baptism is an initiating Rite or Ordinance; now if their Infants are in Covenant with themselves, and are made visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church-Members by Baptism in Infancy, and until by actual Sins they violate their Rite and Privilege, abide Members thereof. (1.) Then I would know whether they have their Names in their Church-Book, or Register, as Members? And (2<hi>dly,</hi>) Whether they ever Excommunicate (or bring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Church Censure) such of their Children who fall into scandalous Sins, or actual Transgressions, or not? (3<hi>dly,</hi>) If not, what kind of polluted Churches must thir's be, who have not purged out such corrupt Members? The truth is, I see not how Infant Baptism is consistent with any Church State, unless it be National; and no doubt, the first Contrivers or Founders of it, devised that way for the Progress of that they call the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and so opened a Door, that Christ shut, when he put an end to the National Church of the <hi>Iews.</hi> — Therefore I wonder at our strict In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants, considering their Notions, (knowing how their Principles differ from; and their Understanding or Knowledge of Gospel-Church Constitution exceeds others) for Baptism does not initiate into their Churches, it seems by their Practice; unless their Children, when baptized, were thereby made Members with them. It is evident, that under the Law, when In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were Members of the Jewish Church, they were born Members thereof, tho' the Males were to be Circumcised on the Eighth day; nor was the case difficult to know the Right, Infants had to Circumcision: it was not from the Faith of immediate Parents; but it was their being the true Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the Flesh, or being Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which gave them a Right to Circumcision, by Vertue of God's positive Command to <hi>Abraham</hi>: — But now if the Infant's Rite arises only from the True and Real Faith of their Parents, the Child, when grown up, may doubt if its Parents, or Father or Mother were not true Believers, whether they had a Right to it or not; or may see cause to question, whether either of them were in truth in the Covenant of Grace, or no; (for who knows who are in a true spiritual Sence in Covenant with God,) especially if their Parents should fall away, or Apostatize, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vicious; which may demonstrate, they were not true Believers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so not the Elect of God themselves: and if so, their Children had no more Right to Baptism, than the Children of open and prophane unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Children have.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:64346:19"/>The truth is, what I have said in these Sermons, may serve to reprove such, who set up a new Wall of Partition, (like that which Christ Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the Blood of his Cross) and so cause Enmity to rise between the Seed of Believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Seed of unbelieving <hi>Gentiles</hi>; by making the Children of ungodly Ones to say, Our Parents were wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not in Covenant with God; and tho' we were baptized, yet had no Right to it: we cannot but envy your Privilege, you are the Children of believing Parents, and are in Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay, and it may cause too, to trust to that Birth-Privilege, and so destroy their Souls, by looking out for no other Regeneration, but that which they had in Baptism in their Infancy.</p>

And where is there any Rule, or Order in all the New Testament, that the Adult must first Believe, and then be Baptized; but Infants must be first Baptised, and then Believe: Sir, God's Word knows nothing of the last, and the Right of Baptism only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon Christ's positive Precept, and Example of the Apostolical Church.</item>
                     <item>2. I affirm, That Infants cannot be said, as such, to be Receivers of Christ, nor Rejectors of him, because they are capable to do neither; nor is there any other way taught in the Gospel of receiving Christ, but by Faith. He that is Baptised, who hath no Grace, no true Grace, true Faith, is but a Baptised Infidel.</item>

               <p>How can you prove, There can be the Divine Habits of Grace in Infants, and yet those Habits lie still, as dead in them, for so many Years, as 'tis from the time they are Baptised, to their Conversion? A sacred Habit, is a Principle of divine Life; yea, a most active, and lively Principle. Can the weakness of Nature hinder the Operations of the Holy Ghost, in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, when the Power of the Devil can't, in the Adult? When <hi>God works, who can let?</hi> Can there be fire, and no heat? Sure, such a mighty Cause would have like weighty Effect on the Souls of Children, were it as you suppose.</p>

               <p>7<hi>thly,</hi> Because it was Repugnant to the End, and grand Design of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Ministry, to receive and Basptise every body, even Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, without distinction; his Ministry being most strict, and severe, (as 'tis acknowledged by all Men.) His Ministry of Preaching, and Baptising was held forth by the Prophet, in these Words, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1. <hi>The Day shall come, which shall burn as an Oven.</hi> He lays the Ax at the Root; he Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no such easie way of making Men Christians, nor Church Members, as these <hi>Paedo-Baptists</hi> speak of; his Ministry seemed like to Fire; in him was the Spirit of Burning kindled, as Mr. <hi>Cotton, On the Covenant,</hi> observes; p. 21.
<q>The Lord also prepared his People by a Spirit of Burning, which,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64346:22"/>
as a Spirit of Bondage, he doth shed abroad into the Hearts of Men: This we read of <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1. It is spoken of <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi>; which did burn as an <hi>Oven</hi> against the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and left them neither the Root of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Covenant,</hi> nor the Branch of their own Good Works: He cutteth them off from the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Mat. 3.9. <hi>Think not to say within your selves, we have Abraham to our father</hi>; and so, by cutting them off from the Root, he leaveth them no Ground to trust to.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But this Man renders <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Ministry, to be of a quite contrary Nature, even the most easiest, flesh-pleasing Doctrine that ever was Preached. If he received all to his Baptism: certainly he has made sad Work for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, for abusing the Ministry of this Great and Holy Prophet.</p>

               <p>By this Man's Reasoning, all the Carnal People of the Jews, that were willing to be Baptised, <hi>Iohn</hi> was to Baptise; and he did Baptise them, as well Unbelievers, as Ignorant Babes; for all his Arguments are as strong to prove that, as for <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptising of Infants: Which, if so, all Pagans and Infidels in the World, are to be baptised, and by Baptsm, be made Christians, and Members of the Gospel Church. O, What a Doctrine does this Man Preach! Do but see what Work he would fain make of that Confession of Sins, which was required of all those that came to <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptism, in Pag. 37, 38. to p. 50. <hi>i. e.</hi> It was such a Confession that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes no ungodly, or unbelieving Person, that was willing to be baptised, so far as I can see. All that were of the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> or in the Legal Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he intimates, might be baptised; nay, he tells us, in pag. 44.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64346:23"/>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> did leave some; nay, more People for Christ or his Disciples to baptize, than he baptized: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he did not baptize all the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> or all of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Iudea</hi>?</p>
               <p>That <hi>Iohn</hi> left some; nay, more People to Christ and his Disciples to be baptized, than he baptized; is expresly asserted by the Holy Ghost, John 4.1. <hi>When Iesus knew how the Pharisees heard that Iesus made and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized more Disciples than</hi> John, <hi>&amp;c. see</hi> John 3.26. <hi>And they came unto</hi> John, <hi>and said unto him,</hi> Rabbi, <hi>he that was with thee beyond</hi> Jordan, <hi>to whom thou bearest witness, behold the same baptizeth, and all men come to him:</hi> How! did <hi>Iohn</hi> baptize all and yet all come to Christ to be baptized? This is strange, what People were these, and where dwelt they? if <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized all the People of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Iudea,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

If <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptism, and the Baptism of Christ, was but one and the same Baptism, as to the Nature, Quality, and Subjects thereof; then he baptized none but such who were first made Disciples, or who were first taught to believe and repent: but the Baptism of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of Christ was but one and the same Baptism, as to the Nature, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Subjects thereof: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he baptized none but such who were first made Disciples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Nature, Quality, and Subjects thereof, were one and the same, all generally affirm: I know no difference, but that after Christ was dead and risen, they that were then baptized, were baptized into him that was come: dead, buried, and raised again; but <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized them, as such that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him, that was to die, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Christ having then not actually suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. 'Tis evident, that Christ's Commission Impowers his Disciples to baptize only such who were discipled, or such who did believe, is plain, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. and this was his Practice, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.1.</p>

'Tis evident, his Ministry was to separate or sever the Wheat from the Chaff, the good from the bad, the carnal Seed from the spiritual, and not to continue them together: for his Ministry, and the Ministry of Christ was the same, tho' Christ had the Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or the far greater Glory: yet the design of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Ministry was the same with the Ministry of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Exell it can be intended of no other Confession, than what would consist with</hi> John's <hi>excluding or casting of none cut, or purging of none out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Man would have us believe, that the Doctrine and Work of Christ, and that of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s, were not consistent, or of one and the same Nature; but directly or repugnant contrary one to the other, <hi>viz.

stand and grow as it will, on its own natural and evil Root: he gathered all into the Garner, even both the Wheat and the Chaff too: but Christ quite overthrew and destroyed when he came, all this that <hi>Iohn</hi> did, <hi>i. e.</hi> Christ lays <hi>the Ax at the Root,</hi> and cuts Sinners down; all must be true Penitent, all must believe, or Christ will receive them not, baptize them not: and he so purges his Floor, that no Chaff must be received into his Garner, <hi>i. e.</hi> into his Gospel Church, for this the Man's Words implies: Let the <hi>Paedo-Baptists</hi> view the Strength of this Champion. Doth not <hi>Iohn</hi> tell the People when they came to his Baptism, <hi>now the Ax is laid to the Root of Trees</hi>? his Doctrine is laid to the Root, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to purge out the Chaff, as palpably as did the Ministry and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ; tho' 'tis true, 'tis Christ's Work to make all <hi>Iohn</hi> Preached, or any other Minister, effectual: <hi>Iohn</hi> Preached, <hi>saying, repent, &amp;c.</hi> Christ Preached the same Doctrine, <hi>saying, repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand</hi>: John <hi>is the voice of one crying in the Wilderness, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths streight,</hi> Mark 1.3. The Jews had made the way to Heaven broad and easie; but <hi>Iohn</hi> strives to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive them, and to shew the Way was narrow, and the Gate streight, like as Christ himself speaks, <hi>because streight is the Gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it,</hi> Mat. 7.14. but this Man intimates that <hi>Iohn</hi> Preached not this Doctrine, but one quite different; he makes the way so broad, that all <hi>Ierusalem, Iudea,</hi> and all the Multitudes round about, might come and walk in it; which if so, instead of prepairing of Christ's Way, he obstructed and hindered Christ in his way, and made him more work to do, even to undoe all that <hi>Iohn</hi> had been a doing.</p>
               <p>But pray be pleased to take his Answer to one of our Arguments brought against what he affirms, that <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized Infants, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All those that <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized, confessed their Sins, but Infants could not confess their Sins; <hi>Ergo, Iohn</hi> did not baptise Infants.</p>
               <p>Obj. Says he, <hi>We are not to believe any other Confession here intended, than what was consistent with the Promise and Covenant made with</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, &amp;c. <hi>so that if it must give no Right to the participation of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> [that is, a Confession must give no Right,] <hi>for then</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Promise and Covenant must be put an end to, and they must have no Right by them,</hi> p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 37.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Doth not <hi>Iohn</hi> positively deny, that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed as such, did give them a Right to his Baptism? for this we have proved to be the proper Purport of that Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his: <hi>Think not to say within your selves; we have</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>to our Father</hi>: and <hi>Mr. Cotton</hi> asserts the same as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64346:24"/>2. We have also proved, that the Legal Covenant, made with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed as such, is put an end to, by the Establishment of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Dispensation.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>It is not to be taken as intended of any other Confession, than what would consist with the Capacity of them that were represented to</hi> John <hi>to be the Objects of his Ministry, which were Parents and Children,</hi> Mat. 4.6. Luk. 1.17. <hi>If there should have been any other Confession than what would consist with these; how should</hi> John <hi>turn them to the Lord, unless they might be as well turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without a Confession, and without baptism, as with it,</hi> p. 37.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If the Confession consisted with the Capacity of those that heard his Ministry, then Infants, were excluded, because they, were not capable to make any Confession at all, but 'twas so; <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What tho' 'tis said <hi>Iohn</hi> was to turn the People to the Lord, and the Hearts of Children to the Fathers: was he able to change the Hearts of Infants? or were Infants Hearts turned from their Fathers, that they need, whilst Iufants to have their Hearts turned to them? Are not my Sons and Daughters my Children, when they are 20, 30, or 40, Years Old, as well as they were my Children when but Two days Old?</p>
               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>It cannot be taken to be any other Confession, than what would consist with all the People, being then the visible Church of God,</hi> &amp;c. p. 38.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Then it appears by this Man, all the whole Church of the Jews, both Parents and Children, were by <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to be taken into the Gospel Church by Baptism; For else, saith he, all the whole Church must be overturned.</p>
               <p>And so I have proved it is; even the whole Jewish Church, and Church-Membership.</p>
               <p>Obj. 4. <hi>No such Confession can be intended as would exalt natural Strength or number of Years, or acquired Abilities, as Necessary, Qualifications; for this is contrary to Scripture,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.27. p. 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If it be a Confession of Sin, it must be made by such, who are at such an Age, as are able to confess Sin, and without natural Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: what Person is able to make such a Confession? can an Infant consess Sin?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That is, I suppose, all the People, one or another; who could speak or say they were Sinners, might be baptized, and upon that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, their Children also; who could make no Confession at all: If
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64346:24"/>
so, all the World by this Argument may be baptized, for no doubt, there were many Thousand Families that lived either in <hi>Ierusalem, Iudea,</hi> or in the Regions round about that were not Jews; <hi>broad is the Way to Heaven,</hi> if this Man's Doctrine be true, or into the Church at least. The Man's mistake lies here, <hi>i. e.</hi> because great Multitudes went out either to see, or hear <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>; he therefore concludes <hi>Iohn baptized</hi> them all, because 'tis said <hi>he baptized them,</hi> not observing the severe Doctrine he Preached, and what a holy Sight and Sence of Sin and godly Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he enjoyned on all those he admitted to Baptism: for they he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, confessed their Sins, <hi>i. e.</hi> their hearty Sorrow for Sin, and were turned to the Lord; for that was his Work, and the grand Purport of his Ministry, — and evident it is, that there were but a few compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> because Christ by the hands of his Disciples baptized more Disciples than he, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.1. and 'tis said, Christ's Flock was but a little Flock; and after Christ's Resurrection, the whole Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Disciples, were about One hundred and Twenty, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.15. tho' may be some few more there might be in some orher places.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> tho' a great Asserter of <hi>Paedo-Baptism,</hi> contradicts this Man, <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> saith he, <hi>received and judged of the Profession of his Penitents before he did baptize them,</hi> Baxt. Confirmat. Restor. <hi>p.</hi> 68.</p>
               <p>It was such a Confession that <hi>Iohn</hi> required of those that he baptized, that gave him Ground to believe they had Right to Remission of Sin, for he baptized with the Baptism of Repentance, for the remission of Sin; Read the late Annotators on <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.3.
<q>The Summ of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Doctrine, (say they) was the necessity of Repentance and Faith in Christ, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Remission of Sin: his pressing Faith in Christ, is most clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared by the <hi>Evangelist Iohn: Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> insist more upon his Preaching the Doctrine of Repentance for the Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sins; Baptism was an Evidence of it: — <hi>Iohn</hi> did not Preach that Baptism was Repentance, or that Remission of Sin was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly annexed to it; but that the way to obtain the Remission of Sins, was by Repentance; and Baptism was an External Sign and Symbol of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was, no doubt, such a Confession that <hi>Philip</hi> required of the <hi>Eunoch,</hi> Act. 8.37. <hi>See here is Water, what doth hinder me to be baptized?</hi> Philip answered, <hi>If thou believest withal thine Heart, thou mayest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Man would render <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> less Faithful than any ordinary pious Minister; I believe saith <hi>Gullespy, No consciencious Minister would adventure to baptize, any who hath manifested infallible Signs of unregenerations,</hi> Gil's. Aaron's Rod. blossom.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Exell, to conclude that this Confession mentioned,</hi> Mat. 3.5. <hi>was a Confession with the Mouth or Tongue, without considering any thing of the words? when there is no such discovery in the Text, is somewhat too quick and too bold; for what is expressed, is expresly asserted of all the Regions, and all</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:64346:25"/>
Judea <hi>and</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and those called Multitudes — and these general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions contain and comprehend. Men, Women, and Children,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I must needs say, 'tis a hard case you dare so boldly affirm all, both Men, Women, and Children, were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi>; whereas, 'tis positively said, that they he baptized confessed their Sins: You conclude against the express Words of the Text, and assert plain Scripture proof, that <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist did certainly baptize Infants, and yet give neither Scripture, nor Reason, to demonstrate what you say is true: you can draw Consequences to build an Ordinance upon that which naturally rises, not from the Texts you refer to; nay, which is more, when the Text is expresly against such a Conclusion: 'tis said, <hi>They that gladly receive the Word were baptized:</hi> You may say, that some of them were Infants, as well as to affirm some of these <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized were such; for Infants are as capable to receive the Word, as to confess their Sins: nay, when 'tis said, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>The Disciples came together to break Bread</hi>; you may affirm, that Infants came then, with others together, to break Bread, <hi>or to eat the Lord's Supper,</hi> for you know how to prove them to be Disciples, no doubt on't; if you have not been too quick in asserting what you with boldness have asserted, I am greatly mistaken.</p>
               <p>You make Baptism a very insignificant Sign, what good can Baptism do that Parson that has no Grace? If you can prove what your Brother <hi>Roth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> affirms do; <hi>viz.</hi> That Baptism does regenerate <hi>Infants,</hi> or is a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ordinance: Certaintly, but very few of that great Multitude, you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized, received any Spiritual benefit by their Baptism; and I challenge all the World to prove if they can, that ever one Infant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any kind of Internals, Spiritual or Eternal Advantage, by being baptized as you call it; or External, either; by the Word of God.</p>
               <p>He adds an Induction of Twenty particulars, to shew what a Confession it was not, that those <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist, baptized, made; but they need no further Reply being all remote to the Purpose brought for: Then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds into ten more, to shew it could not be a verbal Confession of Actual Faith and Repentance; the most of them follow here.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>There is nothing of a Command requiring such a Confession, neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by</hi> John, <hi>nor revealed by any other Messenger of God:</hi> This contains his two First.</p>

Can't God give Grace, and then command us by the Assistance of his Spirit, to cause those Graces to appear in exercise to the Praise of his own Glory?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or cannot that which God commands us to do, be done freely and voluntary by us? Or, doth free Grace destroy the Noble Faculty of the <hi>Will,</hi> because it over-powers its vitious Habits, and strongly inclines it to that which is good? Do not Saints freely and voluntarily by the help of the Spirit and Grace of Christ, <hi>will</hi> that which is good and well-pleasing to him? Or, is a Confession of Sin not good, or an Evangelical Duty?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do we not by our Obedience to God shew forth his Grace in us, as well as our Duty of Obedience to him; what New Divinity is this? <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, O Heavens!</hi>

               <p>Obj. <hi>If commanded, then the performance of it externally could not make a Change upon their State and Relation towards God, any more than the performance of any other Duty: Much less could it, when not commanded: Pag.</hi> 45.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Answ.</hi> Because a Confession of Sin can't make a Change upon our State, or Relation to God: Must we not make an External Confession of that which God's Spirit hath wrought Internally upon our Souls? Or, must an External Confession of Sin make a Change, and so all other Duties, or else not be performed by us?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It seems to me by your unfound Expressions, as if you conceive, that an External Confession could make a Change upon our State and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God; whereas that makes no Change, but only discovers, or makes known what a blessed Change the Grace of God hath wrought, or made on the Soul: Besides, it is not Universally true, <hi>i. e.</hi> because a thing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it can't make a Change; for sometimes a Command is attended with Power to change the Soul, <hi>&amp;c. Iohn</hi> 6.28.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>If this, say you, had been a commanded Duty</hi> (viz. <hi>a Confession of Sin</hi>) <hi>to qualifie them for Baptism; then they must not be admitted upon the Account of their being the Children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>nor as the Children of the Promise, but the Promise ceases, which is notoriously false,</hi> Rom. 15.8. <hi>Pag.</hi> 45.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Answ.</hi> We do not say a bare verbal Confession qualifies any Person for Baptism; but inward Grace or Truth, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; this is the only Qualification which ought to be in all the Subjects of Baptism<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this Faith must be made manifest by the Confession of the Mouth, and the holy Fruits of the Life: Hence <hi>Iohn</hi> required not only a bare verbal Confession, which might hold-forth or signifie their Repentance; but also saith he, <hi>You must bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance:</hi> Don't think to say you have sinned, or barely to acknowledge your Iniquities is all I look for; No, your Lives must make it manifest to me, you are changed, or

               <p n="2">2. As to your other Reason, <hi>viz.</hi> if a Confession be necessary, <hi>then their being the Children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and Children of the Promise was made to cease,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>You hit it in that, for their being the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Flesh, could give them no Right to Gospel Baptism. <hi>Iohn</hi> plainly told them the very same thing; for the Gospel has put an End to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Covenant Right of Admission of Church-Members; the Text you mention, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. (where 'tis said, <hi>Christ was a Minister of the Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;)</hi> you strangely mistake the Place, Christ did not confirm Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, nor Infants Right to Church Membership; the Holy Ghost means no more then that Christ was a Minister of the Jews, as well as of the Gentiles, or of the Circumcision, as of the Uncircumcision, and so speak our Annotators on the place; and as to the Promise ceasing, see what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. Tho' the carnal Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as such, are now rejected, yet the Promise of God is not made of none Effect. For (saith he) <hi>They are not all</hi> Israel <hi>which are of</hi> Israel; <hi>Neither, because they are the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they all Children,</hi> v. 7. <hi>That is, they which are the Children of the Flesh, these are not the Children of God; but the Children of the Promise are counted for the Seed,</hi> v. 8.</p>
               <p>Can't you see from hence who are the Seed of the Promise? Even none else, but such who are begotten and born of the Spirit, or are in Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. So that, what you say is notoriously false.</p>
               <p>Your 9th. Reason is the same with the part of your 8th.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>You say in the tenth and last Place then, the Command of Christ that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants must come to him, was and must be null and void,</hi> Mark 10.13.14.15. <hi>Or be a fresh Warrant for their coming to him, if</hi> John <hi>had cast them out</hi> Pag. 45.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Answ.</hi> We deny there was ever any Command of Christ for Infants to be brought, or to come to Christ to be baptized.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>If you could prove Infants had Grace in the Habit, or that it appears they are regenerated, you had said something to excuse their inability, or disability to make a verbal Confession, tho' not so much as you think; 'tis the Act of Faith that must demonstrate the Habit to us, or the Fruits, or Product of Grace, that those Habits are in those Subjects Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to be baptized, <hi>non apparentium &amp; non existentium eadem est ration</hi>; they must act, must believe, must repent, or must be actually discipled, that Baptism doth belong unto; tho' I deny not but that where the Habit of one Grace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
