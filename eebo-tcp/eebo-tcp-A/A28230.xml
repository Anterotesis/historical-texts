            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Furnace in Jeruſalem. And the Light of Iſrael ſhall be for a Fire, and his holy One for a Flame, and it ſhall burn, and Devour his Thorns, and his Bryars in One Day; and ſhall conſume the Glory of his Forreſts, and of his Fruitful Field both Soul and Body; and they ſhall be as when a Standard-Bearer fainteth: and the reſt of the Trees of the Forreſt ſhall be few, ſo that a Child may Write them. And it ſhall come to paſſe in that Day that the Remnant of Iſrael, and ſuch as are Eſcaped of the houſe of Jacob, ſhall no more ſtay upon him that ſmote them, but ſhall ſtay upon the Lord the Holy One of Iſrael in Truth; The Remnant ſhall Return, Even the Remnant of Jacob unto the Mighty God; For, though thy People Iſrael be as the Sand of the Sea; Yet a Remnant of them ſhall Return. The Conſumption Decreed ſhall overflow with Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. For, the Lord God of Hoſts ſhall make a Conſumption. Even Determined in the midſt of all the Land. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts, O my People that Dwelleſt in Sion, Be not afraid of the Aſſyrian; He ſhall ſmite thee with a Rod, and ſhall lift up his ſtaff againſt thee after the manner of Egypt, but yet a very little while, and the Indignation ſhall ceaſe, and mine Anger in their Deſtruction. And it ſhall come to paſſe in that Day; that his Burden ſhall be taken from off thy ſhoulder; and his Yoke from off thy Neck; becauſe of the Anointing. Behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hoſts, ſhall Lop the Bough with Terrour, and the High Ones of Stature ſhall be hewen Down; and the Haughty ſhall be humbled. And he ſhall cut the Thickets of the Forreſt with Iron; and Lebanon ſhall fall by a Mighty One.</hi>

For, <hi>Nation ſhall riſe up againſt Nation,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and Kingdom againſt Kingdom; and there ſhall be Famines, and Peſtilences, and Earthquakes in divers places. All theſe are but the beginning of Sorrows. Then ſhall they Deliver ye up to be Afflicted; and ſhall kill you; and ye ſhall be hated of all Men for my Names ſake, And, then ſhall many be offended, and betray One another, and ſhall hate One another: And many falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, and ſhall Deceive many; and becauſe Iniquity ſhall abound the Love of many ſhall Wax Cold; But he that ſhall Endure unto the End, the ſame ſhall be ſaved. And this Goſpel of the Kingdom ſhall be Preached in all the World, for a Witneſs unto all Nations, and then ſhall the End Come. When ye therefore, ſhall ſee the Abomination of Deſolation ſpoken of by Daniel the Prophet, ſtand in the holy Place (who ſo readeth let him Underſtand) then let them which be in Judea flee unto the Mountains. Let him that is on the houſe Top, not come down to take any thing out of his houſe.

And Except thoſe Dayes ſhould be ſhortned, there ſhould no Fleſh be ſaved: but for the Elects ſake thoſe Dayes ſhall be ſhortned. Then if any Man ſhall ſay unto you, Lo here is Chriſt, or there, believe it not; For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew Great Signs and Wonders, inſomuch that if it were Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhall Deceive the very Elect, Behold, I have told ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Therefore if they ſhall ſay unto you, behold he is in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart; go not forth; Behold he is in the ſecret Chambers, believe it not.

               <hi>Take ye heed, Watch and Pray; for ye know not when the time is, For, the Son of Man is as a man taking a far Journey; who left his houſe, and gave Authority to his Servants and to every Man his Work, and commanded the Porter to watch; watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the Maſter of the Houſe cometh, at Even, or at Midnight, or at the Cock-crowing, or in the Morning; Leaſt coming ſuddainly he find you ſleeping; And what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, watch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let your Loyns be girded about, and your Lights burning, and ye your ſelves like unto Men that wait for their Lord when he will return from the Wedding, that when he knocketh they may open to him Immediately: Bleſſed are thoſe Servants whom the Lord when he cometh ſhall find Watching. Verily I ſay unto you, that he ſhall Gird himſelf; and make them ſit down to meat; and will come forth, and ſerve them. And if he ſhall come in the ſecond Watch; Or come in the third Watch; and find them ſo, Bleſſed are thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And this know, that if the Good Man of the houſe had known what hour the Thief would come, he would have watched, and not have ſuffered his houſe to be broken through. Be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ready alſo, for the Son of Man cometh at an hour ye think not. Who then is that Faithful, and Wiſe Steward, whom his Lord ſhall make Ruler over his houſhold, to give them their Portion of meat in due Seaſon; Bleſſed is that ſervant whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing; of a Truth I ſay unto you, he will make him Ruler over all that he hath. But, and if that ſervant ſay in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming, and ſhall begin to beat the men ſervants, and the Maidens, and to Eat, and Drink, and to be Drunken. The Lord of that ſervant will come in a Day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour that he is not a ware; and will cut him in ſunder, and will appoint him his Portion with the Unbelievers. And that ſervant which knew his Lords will, and prepared not himſelf; Neither did according to his Will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of ſtripes; ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes. For, to</hi>

               <hi>whom ſoever much is given, of him ſhall much be required; and to whom Men have committed much; of him they will ask the more.</hi>

They that were Fooliſh took their Lamps, and took no Oyl with them; but the Wiſe took Oyl in their Veſſels with their Lamps. While the Bridegroom tarried they all ſlumbred, and ſlept. And at midnight there was a cry made. Behold the Bridegroom cometh, goe ye out to meet him. Then all thoſe Virgins aroſe, and Trimmed their Lamps; and the Fooliſh ſaid unto the Wiſe, Give Us of your Oyl for our Lamps are gone out: But the Wiſe anſwered, ſaying, Not ſo, leaſt there be not enough for Us and you; but go ye rather to them that Sell, and Buy for your ſelves. And while they went to Buy the Bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him into the Marriage; and the Door was ſhut. Afterwards came alſo the other Virgins, Saying, Lord, Lord open to Us; nad he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid, Verily, I know you not.
