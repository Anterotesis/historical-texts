         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

all the Excesses to which he is prompted by his
natural Inclinations, if he may do them with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
while he is alive, and he uncapable of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
after he is dead! if he be cunning and
secret enough to avoid the Laws, there is no

Reputation are weak Ties; many Men have not

aw'd by them, as they cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that not always when a Passion is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
and no Man will be contained within the
bounds of Duty, when he may safely transgress
them. These are my Thoughts abstractedly, and
without entering into the Notions of our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Faith, which is the proper Business of Divines.</p>
                  <p>But there are other Arguments in this Poem
(which I have turn'd into <hi>English</hi>) not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Mortality of the Soul, which are strong
enough to a reasonable Man, to make him less
in love with Life, and consequently in less ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of Death. Such as are the natural
Satiety, proceeding from a perpetual Enjoyment
of the same things; the Inconveniencies of old
age, which make him incapable of corporeal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
the Decay of Vnderstanding and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
which render him contemptible and useless to
others; these and many other Reasons so patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
urg'd, so beautifully expressed, so adorn'd
with examples, and so admirably rais'd by the
<hi>Prosopopeia</hi> of Nature, who is brought in
speaking to her Children, with so much Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Vigour, deserve the pains I have taken
with them, which I hope have not been unsucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
or unworthy of my Author. At least I must
<pb facs="tcp:45711:6"/>
take the liberty to own, that I was pleas'd with
my own endeavours, which but rarely happens to
me, and that I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot dissatisfied upon the review<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of any thing I have done in this Author.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, there is something, and that of
some moment, to be objected against my <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
the Nature of Love, from the fourth Book
of <hi>Lucretius:</hi> And I can less easily answer why
I translated it, than why I thus translated it.
The Objection arises from the Obscenity of the
Subject; which is aggravated by the too lively,
and alluring dilicacy of the Verses. In the first
place, without the least formality of an excuse,
I own it pleas'd me: and let my Enemies make
the worst they can of this Confession; I am not
yet so secure from that Passion, but that I want
my Authors Antidotes against it. He has given
the truest and most Philosophical account both of
the Disease and Remedy, which I ever found in
any Author: For which reasons I translated him.
But it will be ask'd why I turned him into this
luscious <hi>English,</hi> (for I will not give it a
worse word:) instead of an answer, I wou'd
ask again of my supercilious Adversaries, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I am not bound when I translate an Author,
<pb facs="tcp:45711:6"/>
to do him all the right I can, and to translate
him to the best advantage? If to mince his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which I am satisfied was honest and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
I had either omitted some part of what he
said, or taken from the strength of his expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I certainly had wrong'd him; and that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of thought and words, being thus cashier'd
in my hands, he had no longer been <hi>Lucretius.</hi>
If nothing of this kind be to be read, Physicians
must not study Nature, Anatomies must not be
seen; and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ewhat I could say of particular pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
in Books, which to avoid prophaness I do
not name: But the intention quali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies the act; and
both mine and my Authors were to instruct as
well as please. 'Tis most certain that barefac'd
Bawdery is the poorest pretence to wit imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
If I shou'd say otherwise, I shou'd have
two great Authorities against me: The one is
the Essay on Poetry, which I publickly valued
before I knew the Author of it, and with the
commendation of which, my Lord <hi>Rosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
so happily begins his Essay on Translated
Verse: The other is no less than our admir'd
<hi>Cowley;</hi> who says the same thing in other words:
For in his Ode concerning Wit he writes thus of it;
<q>
                        <pb facs="tcp:45711:7"/>
                        <l>Much less can that have any place</l>
                        <l>At which a Virgin hides her Face:</l>
                        <l>Such dross the fire must purge away; 'tis just</l>
                        <l>The Author blush, there where the Reader must.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here indeed Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> goes farther than
the Essay; for he asserts plainly that obscenity has
no place in Wit; the other only says, 'tis a poor
pretence to it, or an ill sort of Wit, which has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more to support it than bare-fac'd Ribaldry;
which is both unmannerly in it self, and fulsome to
the Reader. But neither of these will reach my
Case: For in the first place, I am only the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator,
not the Inventor; so that the heaviest
part of the Censure falls upon <hi>Lucretius,</hi> before
it reaches me: In the next place neither he nor I
have us'd the grossest words; but the cleanliest Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors
we cou'd find, to palliate the broadness of
the meaning; and to conclude, have carried the
Poetical part no farther, than the Philosophical
exacted. There is one mistake of mine which I
will not lay to the Printers charge, who has enough
to answer for in false pointings: 'tis in the word
<hi>Viper;</hi> I wou'd have the Verse run thus,
<q>
                        <pb facs="tcp:45711:7"/>
                        <l>The Scorpion, Love, must on the wound be
bruis'd.</l>
                     </q>
There are a sort of blundering half-witted people,
who make a great deal of noise about a verbal slip;
though <hi>Horace</hi> wou'd instruct them better in true
Criticism: <hi>Non ego paucis offendor maculis
quas aut incuria fudit, aut humana parùm ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit
natura.</hi> True Iudgment in Poetry, like that
in Painting, takes a view of the whole together,
whether it be good or not; and where the beauties
are more than the Faults, concludes for the Poet
against the little Iudge; 'tis a sign that malice
is hard driven, when 'tis forc'd to lay hold on a
Word or Syllable; to arraign a Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is one thing,
and to cavil at him is another. In the midst of
an ill natur'd Generation of Scriblers, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Iustice enough left in Mankind, to protect
good Writers: And they too are oblig'd, both by
humanity and interest, to espouse each others Cause,
against false Criticks, who are the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
This last consideration puts me in mind of
what I owe to Mr. <hi>Creech</hi> the Ingenious and
Learned Translator of <hi>Lucretius;</hi> I have not
<pb facs="tcp:45711:8"/>
here design'd to rob him of any part of that Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
which he has so very justly acquir'd by
the whole Author, whose Fragments only fall to
my Portion. What I have now perform'd, is no
more than I intended above twenty years ago:
The ways of our Translation are very different;
he follows him more closely than I have done;
which became an Interpreter of the whole Poem. I
take more liberty, because it best suited with my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
which was to make him as pleasing as I could.
He had been too voluminous had he us'd my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
in so long a Work, and I had certainly taken
his, had I made it my business to Translate the
whole. The preference then is justly his; and I
joyn with Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi> in the confession of it,
with this additional advantage to him; that his
Reputation is already establish'd in this Poet,
mine is to make its Fortune in the World. If I
have been any where obscure, in following our
common Author, or if <hi>Lucretius</hi> himself is to be
condemnd, I refer my self to his Mr. <hi>Creech's</hi>
excellent Anotations, which I have often read, and
with some always with some new pleasure.</p>

His Highly Esteem'd Friend
George Pitt Junior,

                  </head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THis hath had the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to wait on you so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that it must now be
grown somewhat familiar and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which will excuse you from a
considerable part of the trouble of
<pb facs="tcp:45711:28"/>
being told what it is, and why it
presumes on your Protection. And
certainly, <hi>Sir,</hi> you had been whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
freed, if it were not pleasant,
now I am safe on Shore, to look
back, and smile at the impotent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of that Sea that tost me, and
gratefully acknowledge his Goodness to
whom I stand principally indebted for
my Safety. Envy, <hi>Sir,</hi> according to
the usual description, bears a very
frightful Figure; Thin, Pale, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is her Face, and Whips and
Snakes her Ornaments; such the
Painters draw, such the <hi>Tragedians</hi>
represent her; and who then, <hi>Sir,</hi>
would be acquainted with so gastly a
Vice? who in love with Deformity it
self? No, we must guess from her
general influence on Mankind, that
this Picture shews but one side, the
other is smooth and gay, smiling
<pb facs="tcp:45711:28"/>
and as well drest as Flattery. As
it carries the Poyson of a Serpent,
so it hath the shining of its Scales,
and creeps with as little Noise. I
could point out some, were it safe,
whom you must acknowledge sate for
this very Draught, who threw a
Snake or two to envenom every Line,
and then cry'd out against it as
noxious in it self, and full of it's
own Poyson; but that design fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a thousand little Stories came
abroad, and innumerable personal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections;
each Man clapt together
what he thought was worst, and
made a more ridiculous Composure
than <hi>Horace</hi>'s Painter could have
contriv'd from all the various Parts
of the Creation: So that when I
look'd upon my self as I came from
their Hands, Heavens! How much
was I chang'd from your old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance!
<pb facs="tcp:45711:29"/>
Some should be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
could I perpetuate their Folly
without injury to my self; but there
is so close a Connexion, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
venture them but in such pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Entertainments as you are pleas'd
now and then to divert your self
withal: These were pretty sure
Cards, but they wanted Art to Play
the Game, and therefore the other
Face was turn'd, and all seem'd
fair and pleasant to look upon:
Fame attended me forsooth, and
my flying <hi>Daphne</hi> was presently
chang'd into a Laurel: And this,
<hi>Sir,</hi>

me the Danger; till I receiv'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
how to avoid the present and
prevent future Practices; till you were
pleas'd, to innumerable others, to

add this Obligation of my safety,

                  <head>THE
LIFE
OF
LUCRETIUS.</head>
                  <p>THE present design doth not require an
exact search into the rise of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
nor a nice Enquiry, whether it
began amongst the <hi>Brachmans,</hi> and thence
(as<note n="*" place="margin">In Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivis.</note> 
                     <hi>Lucian</hi> ranks the Countrys) visited <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,
Egypt, Scythia, Thrace</hi> and <hi>Greece;</hi>
or whether <hi>Curiosity</hi> or <hi>Necessity</hi> was the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
the advantageousness of the Plains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
the <hi>Caldeans</hi> to Astronomy, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing
of <hi>Nile,</hi> forc'd the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to be
curious in the <hi>Properties</hi> of Figures: But I
shall take it for granted, that it came from
the East; and This (not to mention<note n="†" place="margin">In Praefat.</note> 
                     <hi>Laertius</hi>
his weak oppositions) the Travels of <hi>Thales,</hi>
and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> of <hi>Democritus, Plato,</hi> and others
sufficiently evince: And the <hi>Egyptians</hi> affirm
These Mens several Methods of <hi>Philosophy</hi> to
be their notions disguised, drest after a <hi>Greek</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45711:31"/>
fashion, and in that Garb proposed to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers:
And thus 'tis probable <hi>Democritus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
his Notions from the <hi>Phaenician</hi> Moscus,
or the Priests of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whose Ambition for
Antiquity made them embrace some of those
absurd Opinions, or if he travelled further
he might have learnt the whole System of his
Philosophy, the <hi>Fortuitus</hi> beginning of the
World, and the <hi>Origine</hi> of Man, from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
That being now the Opinion of the
Principal Philosophers in<note n="*" place="margin">Hist. Mars.</note> 
                     <hi>China,</hi> whether
the learning of all <hi>India</hi> long ago retired;
This <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> tho commended to men as the
strongest Expedient against Cares, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actest
Method for obtaining Tranquillity, yet
found not many Admirers, till <hi>Epicurus</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Volums endeavoured to illustrate, and
commend it, adding <hi>Declination</hi> to an Atom,
that being (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> assures) the only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
he made in the <hi>Hypothesis:</hi> What
this Man was in his Morals is hard to imagin;
for sometimes he seems to be so Temperate
and Modest, that <hi>Seneca</hi> often uses his Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as Ornaments in his most serious Epistles:
Sometimes his Books declare him a most loose
and dissolute Voluptuary, and<note n="†" place="margin">Athenaeus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Tully</hi> makes
such a confident appeal to Mankind for the
sincerity of his quotations, that we cannot but
be amazed at the unsettled humour of the Man.
<pb facs="tcp:45711:31"/>
But He dying, though in his Will he made great
provision for the perpetuity of his Sect, His
Opinions were but coldly receiv'd, and the
School decayed, till <hi>C. Memmius,</hi> a Man of an
Ancient Nobility, restored the Garden, and
design'd to raise a public<note n="*" place="margin">Cicero E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. Lib. 13.</note> Building for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of <hi>Epicurism:</hi> His same and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
drew many after him, and we find regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
at once as famous, <hi>Velleius, Patro,</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius;</hi>
of this man Antiquity hath left us very
few <hi>Memoires,</hi> perhaps for the same reason that

which being divided into a great many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
gave <hi>Rome Consuls, Tribunes,</hi> and <hi>Praetors,</hi>
great Supports and Ornaments of the Common
wealth: 'Tis uncertain from which branch our
<hi>Lucretius</hi> sprang, and the time of his Birth is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as doubtful, some placing him in one year,
some in another, and in this, as in most Things
else, making good that inverted taunt of<note n="*" place="margin">De Mort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Claudii.</note>

Eusebius</hi> brings him forth in the 171
Olympiad. <hi>Domitius Ahenobarbus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius
Longinus</hi> then Consuls <hi>V. C. 657. Lydiat</hi>
leaves it doubtful, whether these were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
<pb facs="tcp:45711:32"/>
the first year of the 871, or, the fourth of
170 Olympaid, but <hi>Vossius</hi> makes him born
in the second year of the 171, whilst others
place him in the 172: So that difference
is not very great, and his Age certain; we
therefore supposing him to be nobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended,
and a Man of a sprightly Wit it is an
easy inference, that he receiv'd a suitable Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that he studied at <hi>Athens,</hi> and heard
<hi>Zeno</hi> the Master of the Gardens: And how he
spent his Time, how studiously improved it
let this <hi>Book</hi> speak. Thus fitted for the best
Company, He grew intimate with<note n="*" place="margin">Cor. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos vit. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici.</note> 
                     <hi>Pomponius
Atticus,</hi> ann <hi>Memmius,</hi> and no doubt with <hi>Tully</hi>
and his <hi>Brother,</hi> who made such honourable
mention of him: And if we look into his
Morals we shall find him a Man suitable to the
<hi>Epicurean</hi> Principles, dissolved in Ease and
Pleasure, flying publick Imployment, as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
to Wisdom, and a disturber of Peace
and Quietness; avoiding those distractive
cares which he imagined would make <hi>Heaven</hi>
it self uneasy: As most of the other Poets, He
had his share in sensual Pleasures; nor can the
poor Excuse of <hi>Catullus,</hi> make me think better
of him when I view his fourth Book: And
the account some give of his Death streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
this Opinion; for as <hi>Eusebius</hi> relates it,
he dyed by his own Hands in the Fourty
<pb facs="tcp:45711:32"/>
Fourth year of his Age, being dementated by
a Philtrum given by his Mistress, tho others
place his Death in the Twenty Sixth year,
and believe his madess, proceeded from the
Cares and Melancholy, that opprest him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Banishment of his beloved <hi>Memmius:</hi>
The only remains this great Wit hath left us
are his Six Books of the Nature of Things;
an exact System of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philosophy,
read and admired by the Ancients; and if
<hi>Ovid</hi> could presage,
<q>
                        <l>Carmina sublimis tunc sunt peritura <hi>Lucreti</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Exitio terras cùm dabit una dies:</l>
                     </q>
These were written, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> declares, in
his lucid Intervals, when the strength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had thrown off all the disturbing Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
and his mind (as 'tis observ'd of Mad men)
was sprightly and vigorous: Then in a Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
rapture he could fly with his <hi>Epicurus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the flaming limits of this World, frame
and dissolve Seas and Heavens in an instant,
and by some unusual sallies, be the strongest
argument of his own opinion; for it seems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that some things which he delivers,
should proceed from <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Iudgment,</hi> or
any Cause but Chance, and unthinking For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
<hi>Tully</hi> (for <hi>Lambine</hi> brings but very weak
reasons against the assertion of <hi>Eusebius</hi>) cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
these writings. <hi>Virgil</hi> eagerly studied
<pb facs="tcp:45711:33"/>
them, as <hi>Macrobius</hi> and <hi>Gellius</hi> witness; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
also calling him <hi>Poetam ingenio &amp; facundiâ
praecellentem:</hi> And <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> hath placed
him <hi>inter Elegantissimos Poetas.</hi> Wherefore if
some great Divines have given him the ill
Name of <hi>Canis,</hi> it was not for any rudness
in his Verse, but due rather to his <hi>Grecian</hi>
Master: <hi>The Eternity of Matter,</hi> and the like
absurd Assertions, corrupting most of the
Philosophies of <hi>Athens.</hi>

                  <l>Not what they write, but only what they wear;</l>
                  <l>Vain tho they be, in them less Care we find</l>
                  <l>To dress the Body than adorn the Mind.</l>

                  <l>Dear bought Experience told me what was true,</l>
                  <l>And Friendship bids me tell those Truths to you.</l>
                  <l>Quit not for publick Cares thy Colledge Life,</l>
                  <l>Nor take, that sort of Settlement, a Wife.</l>
                  <l>Trust not the glittering Court, or noisie Town</l>
                  <l>Hang not on this Fool's Laugh, nor that Knaves Frown.</l>
                  <l>But as thou art, Lord of thy self appear,</l>

From whence 'tis easily concluded, that they imagine the <hi>Divine</hi> Perception arises from the same Causes that <hi>Man</hi>'s doth, <hi>viz.</hi> from some subtile <hi>Images</hi> that flow from the surfaces of Things, and enter at the <hi>Senses.</hi> Now it had been an attempt worthy the soaring Wit of our <hi>Poet,</hi> to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed the passages of these <hi>Images;</hi> how they reach the Happy Seats entire, how these light Airy things are undisturbed by the rapid whirls of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and how at last they should all conveniently turn round, and enter at the Eyes of the Deity. For if ours can ascend thither, why not the Forms of these things, that lie scatter'd through the infinite Worlds reach us? No, their <hi>Gods</hi> must be as sensless, as they are careless; no intruding Images must disturb their thoughts, or turn them from the contemplation of their <hi>Happy</hi> Selves; no doubt their Ease will scarce agree with such troublesome agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and like the soft <hi>Sybarite,</hi> should the Image of a Man digging incroach upon them, they must necessarily undergo a <gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>Flame</hi> could perish, and it's Parts could change,</l>
                     <l>If this could once be done, then all it's Heat</l>

                     <l>We plainly can discover what it is.</l>
                     <l>For this it means: That Bones of minute Bones,</l>
                     <l>That Flesh of Flesh, and Stones of little Stones,</l>
                     <l>That Nerves take other little Nerves for food,</l>
                     <l>That Blood is made of little drops of Blood;</l>
                     <l>That Gold from parts of the same nature rose,</l>
                     <l>That Earths do Earth, Fires Fire, Airs Air compose,</l>
                     <l>And so in all things else alike to those.</l>
                     <l>But <hi>He</hi> admits no <hi>Void,</hi> He grants no <hi>Least,</hi>
                     </l>

                     <l>If they are like the Bodies they compose,</l>
                     <l>And liable to death as well as those:</l>

Besides, the <hi>Epicureans</hi> grant they have a Conception of <hi>Atoms, void</hi> and <hi>infinite,</hi> of which they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive any <hi>Image</hi> and consequently no cause of their Conception; <hi>Matter</hi> being not to be moved, but by <hi>material Images,</hi> and those too of equal big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with the <hi>Corpuscles</hi> that frame the Soul.

                        </gap> on something that is so: Now this <hi>Being</hi> cannot be <hi>Matter,</hi> for all <hi>Matter</hi> is <hi>divisible,</hi> and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with <hi>necessary existence;</hi> now this <hi>Substance,</hi> as <hi>He created,</hi> so he must <hi>move</hi> Matter, for <hi>Motion</hi> is not a necessary Mode of it, as every Man's Senses will
evince. And 'tis the same thing to create and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a Being, with such and such a Mode or Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as it is barely to create it. And this infers that <hi>He</hi> can act on <hi>Matter</hi> as much as the <hi>Soul</hi> now doth, and this Action is not any thing distinct from his <hi>Will;</hi> the same <hi>Power</hi> that created, moves it; and that this may be easily conceived every Man hath a <hi>secret Witness</hi> in himself, and may be convinced from his own Actions. But let us consider a little farther, and we shall find <hi>Motion</hi> as difficult to be conceived as this <hi>mode of Acting;</hi> for those that define <hi>Motion</hi> to be only a <hi>successive Mode of Being in respect to Place,</hi> only tell us the <hi>Effect</hi> of it, when we enquire after its <hi>Nature:</hi> I shall therefore take it for a <hi>Physical</hi> Being, and distinct from <hi>Matter,</hi> as its transitions out of one Body into another sufficiently evince; and any Man may easily observe how full of contradictions <hi>Cartes</hi> is, when he treats of this Subject, having determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Motion</hi> to be only a <hi>mode of Matter.</hi> Now all the definitions of the Philosophers prove, that we have no <hi>Idea</hi> of this but from its effects; and therefore its manner of <hi>Acting,</hi> of <hi>Transition,</hi> &amp;c. is as hard to be conceived, as the mode of <hi>Action</hi> in an <hi>immaterial</hi> Substance, and yet no Man doubts it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, there is a great contest about <hi>Brutes,</hi> some allowing them <hi>perception,</hi> others asserting them to be nothing but <hi>Machines,</hi> and as void of all Sense as an Engine. This latter Opinion is irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their <hi>Actions,</hi> and to that experience we have of their <hi>Docility,</hi> and the relations of their <hi>Cunning,</hi> even from those Mens Mouths, which are great stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <l>Great things! You carefully attend to these.</l>
                  <l>First then, the <hi>Surfaces</hi> of things must bear</l>
                  <l>The constant impulse of the <hi>neighbouring</hi> Air,</l>

                  <l>Besides, our Breath when drawn, in that short stay</l>
                  <l>Grates off some <hi>inward</hi> parts, and bears away</l>
                  <l>In it's <hi>return</hi> again it's conquer'd prey.</l>
                  <l>Since then our <hi>Limbs</hi> receive, and since they bear</l>

                  <l>Confusion there, and disunite the Seed;</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Bodies</hi> strength must fail by just degrees,</l>
                  <l>It's <hi>vigor</hi> weakned by enfeebling Ease,</l>
                  <l>Some <hi>Soul</hi> they <hi>drive away,</hi> and <hi>some</hi> they press,</l>
                  <l>Drive deeper in, and shut in <hi>close</hi> Recess;</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Some parts</hi> spread o're the Limbs, no more <hi>combine,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Nor with the <hi>others</hi> in friendly motion joyn,</l>
                  <l>For <hi>Nature</hi> stops the passages between.</l>
                  <l>Now since the <hi>Atoms</hi> different ways are tost,</l>
                  <l>And lose their <hi>usual</hi> course, their <hi>sense</hi> is lost;</l>
                  <l>And when that <hi>prop</hi> is gone, the <hi>Lids</hi> must fall,</l>
                  <l>The Limbs grow <hi>dull,</hi> and <hi>weakness</hi> spread o're all.</l>
                  <l>Thus after Meals we sleep, because the <hi>food,</hi>

                  <l>Doth only what the Air did use to do;</l>
                  <l>For That doth press the Soul, and break it too.</l>
                  <l>So after <hi>labour,</hi> or with toyl <hi>opprest,</hi>

First then, from <hi>Objects seen</hi> thin Forms arise,</l>
                  <l>In constant subtle Streams, and strike our Eyes:</l>

evince. And 'tis the same thing to create and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a Being, with such and such a Mode or Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as it is barely to create it. And this infers that <hi>He</hi> can act on <hi>Matter</hi> as much as the <hi>Soul</hi> now doth, and this Action is not any thing distinct from his <hi>Will;</hi> the same <hi>Power</hi> that created, moves it; and that this may be easily conceived every Man hath a <hi>secret Witness</hi> in himself, and may be convinced from his own Actions. But let us consider a little farther, and we shall find <hi>Motion</hi> as difficult to be conceived as this <hi>mode of Acting;</hi> for those that define <hi>Motion</hi> to be only a <hi>successive Mode of Being in respect to Place,</hi> only tell us the <hi>Effect</hi> of it, when we enquire after its <hi>Nature:</hi> I shall therefore take it for a <hi>Physical</hi> Being, and distinct from <hi>Matter,</hi> as its transitions out of one Body into another sufficiently evince; and any Man may easily observe how full of contradictions <hi>Cartes</hi> is, when he treats of this Subject, having determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Motion</hi> to be only a <hi>mode of Matter.</hi> Now all the definitions of the Philosophers prove, that we have no <hi>Idea</hi> of this but from its effects; and therefore its manner of <hi>Acting,</hi> of <hi>Transition,</hi> &amp;c. is as hard to be conceived, as the mode of <hi>Action</hi> in an <hi>immaterial</hi> Substance, and yet no Man doubts it.</p>

                  <p>THE Campaign being over,
and Councils not yet begun,
the World is very much at
quiet; nor can I find News enough
to fill a Letter: But to keep up our
usual Correspondence, I send you an
Account of an old <hi>Latin Poet,</hi> very
little known, tho' as worthy your
Acquaintance, as many of those who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45711:198"/>
are in Credit. He lay buried in the
<hi>German</hi> Libraries, not heard of in
the World, till <hi>Poggius</hi> Publish'd him
from some old Manuscripts found
there; and tho'<note n="1" place="bottom">Vid. Not. ad Lucianum.</note> 
                     <hi>Burde Cotzus,</hi>
thinks <hi>Lucian</hi> consulted this Poet
when he wrote his little Treatise of

as an ungrateful Plagiary, for
not acknowledging from whom he
Transcrib'd the chiefest parts of his
Books; yet there is no good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that any one Writer menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
this Author before <hi>Poggius. Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>

                     <hi>Astrologer;</hi> but concerning the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45711:198"/>
                     <hi>Poet,</hi> there is as dead a silence as if
he had never been; nor can his
greatest Admirers find any Character
of him in old Writers.</p>
                  <p>Yet it must be own'd, that he is
an Author of some considerable Age;
for the Manuscripts which <hi>Poggius,
Bonincontrius, Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Franciscus
Iunius</hi> us'd, were ancient: <hi>Tanaquil Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Spanhemius,</hi> and the severest Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
allow him to be as old as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>
the Great, and pretend to find
some particular Phrases in him, which
are certain Characters of that Time.</p>
                  <p>Others, who believe they have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good Reasons to place him higher,
find it very difficult to account for
this universal silence: What they offer,
is either bare May-be and Shift, and
scarce ever amounts to a tolerable
Reason: 'Tis true, they say, he is
not mention'd by <hi>Ovid</hi> in his<note n="5" place="bottom">De Ponto, lib. 4. Ep. 16.</note> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45711:199"/>

or his Fame did not reach so far as
<hi>Pontus:</hi> Otherwise they are confident
there are too many Graces in his
Poem to be neglected; at least, the
singularity of his Subject would
have deserved to be taken notice of,
as well as that of<note n="8" place="bottom">Aptaque venanti Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<note n="1" place="bottom">Instit. lib. 1. cap. 10.</note> affirms, that a competent skill in
<hi>Astronomy</hi> is necessary to make him
perfect in his Profession? Why the
following <hi>Philologers</hi> never use his
Authority, tho' it might very often
have been pertinently cited by <hi>Gelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
and <hi>Macrobius?</hi> Why the <hi>Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
and <hi>Mythologists,</hi> seem to be
altogether unacquainted with his
Writings? They confess these are
Questions not easie to be answer'd.</p>
                  <p>Of this Poet, who is acknowledged
by all Parties to have lain very long
unknown, and about whom, since
he first appear'd in the World, so
many Controversies have risen, I
am now to give you an account.</p>
                  <p>His Name is commonly said to be
<hi>Marcus Manilius,</hi> which in some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of his Poem is shortned into
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45711:200"/>
                     <hi>Manlius,</hi> in others softned into <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius:</hi>
This variation is inconsiderable,
and the common fault of unaccurate
Transcribers; but<note n="2" place="bottom">Praef.</note> 
                     <hi>Bonincontrius</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms;
that the Title of his very
Ancient Copies was, <hi>C. Manilii Poetae
illustris Astronomicon;</hi> and that he had
seen a Medal, in which was the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of a Man, but in a Foreign
Habit, with a Sphere plac'd near his
Head, and this Inscription, <hi>C. MA<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <note n="3" place="bottom">Lib. de Poet. Hist. dial. 4.</note>
                     <hi>Lilius Gyraldus</hi> mentions
another of the same stamp; But
that these Medals belong'd to this
Poet, may be as easily deny'd, as
'tis affirm'd, or rather, as 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured:
However all Parties agree,
that the most Ancient Copies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
bear the Title of <hi>Manilius;</hi>
but whether the Books of <hi>Poggius</hi>
and <hi>Bonincontrius,</hi> which call him
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45711:200"/>
                     <hi>Caius,</hi> or those of <hi>Scaliger</hi> and others,
in which we find <hi>Marcus</hi> written, are
to be follow'd, is submitted to every
Man's Discretion; the Matter is not
of any Consequence, nor a fit Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for Dispute, because impossible
to be determin'd: Tho' if Conjecture
may be admitted, I should fancy that
it is more probable a Transcriber
may err, when he puts <hi>M.</hi> before
<hi>Manilius,</hi> than when he writes a <hi>C.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in the former case, the Sound
of the following Word, which is the
most considerable in the Title, and
consequently the chiefest in his
Thoughts, may pervert him; but in
the latter, He hath no temptation to
mistake. This <hi>M.</hi> or <hi>C. Manilius,</hi>
was born a <hi>Roman,</hi> and liv'd in <hi>Rome</hi>
when <hi>Rome</hi> was in her Glory; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the biggest part of the known
World, and full of the greatest Men
that ever any time produc'd: For the

same Age that saw <hi>Manilius</hi> enjoy'd
<hi>Varro, Lucretius, Cicero, Caesar, Virgil,

                     <hi>Mallius,</hi> was as to Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
a <hi>Stoick,</hi> and built his World
according to the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of that Sect,
and therefore wrote something very
like what we find at large in the first
Book, and hinted at in several passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the other Books of <hi>Manilius.</hi>
But this being the least part of our
Author, and subservient to his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and general design, it must not be
suppos'd that <hi>Claudian</hi> should enlarge
only upon this, and leave his whole
<hi>Astrology</hi> untoucht; unless we think
<hi>Claudian</hi> as ridiculous as that Painter
would be, who being to fill his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas
with a noble Family should draw
a single Servant, or paint only a Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or a Nail when he had a large beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Body to represent.</p>
                  <p>I have been the more particular in
this matter, because <hi>Gevartius</hi> pretends
to demonstration, tho' to confute his
conjecture it had been sufficient only
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45711:209"/>
to observe, that it is the most ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
thing in the World to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that <hi>Mallius</hi> a Man well known
both for his personal Endowments
and publick Employments, who had
been Governour of several Provinces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and at last <hi>Consul</hi> should publish a
Treatise under his own Name, and
yet in almost every Page of the Book
endeavour to perswade his Readers
it was written four hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
For it must be granted that
the Prince whom he<note n="1" place="bottom">Lib. 1. v. 7.</note> invokes in the
beginning of his Poem, who is stiled
<hi>Patriae Princepsque Paterque,</hi> who is
deify'd whilst<note n="2" place="bottom">lib. 1. v. 9. et 924.</note> alive, and (not to

of <hi>Augustus:</hi> For if this be true all the
Pretences of <hi>Manilius</hi> are ruin'd; but
since that Writer doth not back his
Assertion with any Reasons, I shall
not submit to his bare Authority,
nor wast my time in guessing what
Arguments he may rely on, being
not bold enough to conjecture what
the daring Author may produce.

of my intended publication of this
piece, which for the Readers satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
I shall here make publick,
tho' not in his own words, yet as
near as may be in his own Sense."</p>
                  <p>"And first in answer to <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s
Argument drawn from Reason to
Time, against <hi>Manilius Antiochus,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the supposition of <hi>Staberius Eros</hi>
(one of the Three before mention'd)
set open his Grammar School in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45711:214"/>
time of <hi>Sylla</hi> ninety five years before
the death of <hi>Augustus;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Manilius</hi> could not probably be
(according to <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
less than 120 Years old at the
time when this Poem was written;
he urges by way of reply, that <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etonius</hi>
(from whom <hi>Scaliger</hi> takes
the ground of his Argument) doth
not say that <hi>Staberius Eros</hi> open'd
his School in <hi>Sylla</hi>'s time, but that
he taught <hi>gratis</hi> the Children of those
who in <hi>Sylla</hi>'s time were proscrib'd.
The Words of <hi>Suetonius</hi> are these,
<hi>Sunt qui tradunt tanta eum (Staberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um)
honestate praeditum, ut temporibus
Syllanis Proscriptorum liberos gratis, et
sine mercede ulla in Disciplina receperit.</hi>
How long that was after the times
of Proscription will be needless here
to declare; and that <hi>Manilius</hi> was
not so old as <hi>Scaliger</hi> conceives, when
this piece was written, may be made
out from this, that he was the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45711:215"/>
German of <hi>Publius Syrus,</hi> who
that he was brought a young Boy
to his Patron, <hi>Macrobius</hi> affirms, from
whom likewise, and from the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>Laberius</hi> it may be collected
that he was but a Youth when he
came upon the Stage against <hi>Laberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
which was but a little before the
death of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> and <hi>Laberius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so;
to whom he succeeded on the
Mimick Stage in the second year of
184 Olympiad, that is in the Year
of <hi>Rome</hi> 711, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> testifies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And therefore seeing it is, manifest
that <hi>Manilius</hi> publish'd this Poem
soon after the <hi>Varian</hi> Defeat, which
happened in the Year 762 of <hi>Rome,</hi>
it is as evident likewise that between
the Youth or Adolescence of <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
and the time wherein he wrote
this piece, there could not pass above
one and fifty Years, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there is no reason to assign so
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45711:215"/>
great an Age to <hi>Manilius,</hi> as <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
here doth, since perhaps he was
not seventy years old when he had
finish'd this his <hi>Astronomical Poem."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"As to what <hi>Scaliger</hi> subjoyns touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Manilius</hi> his wish for <hi>long life toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a cheerful old Age,</hi> and the
Inference he thence makes that <hi>he
could not reasonably be thought to be
old then, who wish'd he might live to be
so.</hi> The Argument is but weak, for
<hi>Senium</hi> is one thing, and <hi>Senium An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosum</hi>
is another; Nor doth he sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
wish for <hi>Vitam Annosam,</hi> but <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam

though with some small difference
in writing of the name. Nor doth

Now that this <hi>Manilius,</hi> or (as he

demonstrates, for as much as a Greek

                  <p>Thus far Sir <hi>Edward Shirburn,</hi> who

with this rational discourse of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable

are still in force, and that <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>'s
his reasonings are all to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
It must be granted that the

no need of this Argument, since <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>

<hi>Manilius</hi> was a <hi>Syrian,</hi> being a near
Kinsman to <hi>Publius Syrus,</hi> and brought
to <hi>Italy</hi> in the same Ship with him:
But that that <hi>Manilius</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> was
the same with <hi>Manilius</hi> the Poet, is a

of Age about the time <hi>Varus</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
by the <hi>Germans.</hi> The first part
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45711:219"/>
of this Assertion may be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from almost all the Pages of his
Book, in which we meet with many
things that are not to be accounted
for on the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Sixty:</hi> He is
too fierce and fiery for that Age, and
bounds every Step he takes: In a
Man of years when we find a Warmth
we feel it to be regular, he never starts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
his Pace is equal, and seldom varies
but when his Subject forces him to a
more than ordinary quickness.</p>
                  <p>Judgment appears all thro', and
a strength well govern'd: When he
rises he doth not affect to climb but
to walk, like a sober Traveller, who
knowing his own force seeks the easiest
ascent, when his Ground is uneven,
or he is oblig'd to take the advantage
of a Prospect. But 'tis not so in
Youth whose Fancies as well as Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are impetuous; that pleases them
most which is most daring, finding
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45711:219"/>
they have strength they use it to the
utmost, and when at last they sink
they seem rather worn out, than ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
I cannot compare the Spirit of
Poetry possessing a Youth, of a strong
generous Imagination and vigorous
Constitution, to any thing better than
to a Flame seizing on the Body of a
<hi>Meteor,</hi> the whole Mass blazes, and
mounts upon a sudden; but its
motion is all the way uneven, and it
quickly falls in a despicable Gelly:
He that looks on the <hi>Latin</hi> of <hi>Manilius</hi>
will see that I do him no Injury when

when he is oblig'd to give rules,
and is ty'd almost to a certain form
of words, he struggles against those

                        </gap>ime,</hi>
when he should endeavour to be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45711:220"/>
plain, intelligible and easy: But as
soon as he hath room to get loose,
how wildly doth he rove? he is not
free but licentious, and strives to err
greatly. 'Tis needless to produce par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
since they are so visible in the
Prefaces, Fables, and Descriptions
thro' his Books: And upon the whole
it may be affirm'd, there are so many
<hi>boldnesses</hi> scatter'd thro' his Poem, and
so much of <hi>Toysomness</hi> just by them,
that a Man may read his Youth in
his writings, as well as his Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries
could do it in his Face.</p>
                  <p>I would mention and enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his conspicuous Vanity, and from
thence endeavour to support the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I have already pass'd; but that
I consider that fault when it hath once
possess'd a Man is not to be cool'd
by all the Frost and Snow of Age:
Yet from the Vanity of <hi>Manilius</hi> I
think a particular Argument may be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45711:220"/>
drawn to prove him to be young, for
he had a design to rival or perfect
the inimitable <hi>Virgil.</hi> This is evident
from the Preface to his third Book:
<q>

Yet he hop'd to live to finish it,
though in the beginning of this Poem
he wishes for <hi>old Age</hi> that he might
compleat the Work he then had in
hand; yet having gone through the
most difficult part of it sooner,
and with more ease than at first he
thought he should have done; he sets
up for new Schemes and thinks he shall
have years enough before him pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to begin, and Strength succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to carry on so great an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.
In this very Preface he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
up a great many other Subjects
fit to employ a Poet, but in express
terms lays them all aside.

But the <hi>Roman</hi> History is in his

                  <p>These Observations will help us to
give some tolerable account of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
difficulties relating to this Author,
for to any one who enquires why the
first Book is more correct than the
rest? why the Impurities of Stile
the Criticks charge upon him are for
the most part pickt out of the four last
Books? I would answer, we have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and that as Poets and Painters are

his Flattery to <hi>Nero</hi> was too

You are sufficiently tired, I fear,
with this long Discourse about <hi>Manili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
full of guesses and conjectures, yet
I cannot dismiss this Subject without
adding something concerning his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and place of Birth. His Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he carries in his name, the <hi>Manilij</hi>
being one of the best Families in <hi>Rome,</hi>
which so often fill'd the Consul's
Chair, and was employ'd in the
greatest Offices of that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
Indeed some have affirm'd
that he was of <hi>Servile Condition,</hi> and
being made free, according to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
took the name of his Patron:
But since I have already prov'd, that
he was not the <hi>Manilius Antiochus</hi> in
<hi>Pliny,</hi> there is no reason left for any
one to say he was a <hi>Slave;</hi> he himself
very expresly, I think, declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be a <hi>Roman</hi> born, for in his
fourth Book he shews a Concern for
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Interests of the <hi>Roman</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45711:225"/>

<hi>Hannibal.</hi>

which he could not with any Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
have done, had his relation to
that State commenc'd so lately, or
had his Ancestors had no Interest in

And seeing he was born a <hi>Roman,</hi> and of
the Family of the <hi>Manilij,</hi> we may
farther from some other Evidences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that he sprung from a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,

This Earth thus form'd was solid, and without Caverns, nor had it any inequalities on its surface; as to its site, its Axis was parallel to the Axis of the Eclip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ick, both its Poles being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually inclin'd to the Sun; and as to its figure it was Oval. These are the few easie principal parts of that excellent Hypothesis, settled on the obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous notions of Gravity and Levity, and on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Nature, and allow'd Motion of a Fluid. And from these so many curious propositions are naturally deduced, so many difficulties concerning Paradise and the Floud happily explain'd, and all set off with that neatness and aptness of expression, and that variety of curious thought, that I am very much inclin'd to believe that Nature was never so well drest before, nor so artificially recommended. And it is pity that the first acknowledged Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Philosophy will not allow it to be true. Inherent Qualities are now generally exploded, as unphilosophical, not to be understood, and unfit to explain the Phaenomena of Nature. The Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of a heavy Body in its descent (beside a thousand other Arguments) quite overthrows Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity both as an accident of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and as essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Matter, according to the fancy of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> so that this motion proceeds onely from external impulse, and depends upon the present order of the World. So that Philosophy will not allow the supposition of Gravity or Levity in a confus'd Chaos, since it can sufficiently demonstrate that they are neither inherent qualities, nor essential to matter, and that it is in vain to look after them, before the system of the World was settled in the present order. From this hint it is easie to infer that the supposed Chaos would have still continued such, the solid Parts would have been agitated this or that way indifferently by the restless particles of the Fluid, but there could have been no orderly separation, because no Principle of it.</p>
                           <p>But suppose such a separation, why must the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Crust of the Globe be without Caverns in its Body, and Inequalities on its Surface? What Law of Nature doth necessarily prove that in such a confusion the solid parts must be equally dispersed through the Body of the Air? If we trust our Eyes, and look upon a Dust raised by the ruin of a House, or onely consider what Confusion is, it will be very hard to find such a regular and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposition. And since these solid Bodies may be unequally dispers'd, and every one of them tends to the Centre by a direct Line, whenever they set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the Body which they compose must be une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in its surface.</p>
                           <p>Yet to let this Difficulty pass, its Figure accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Hypothesis will be much more Oval than common observation will allow, for since it is said to be Oval because the Motion of the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator is swifter than that of the Polar Circles, the figure must be almost as much Oval, as the Circle of the <hi>Aequator</hi> is bigger than the Circle of the Pole; there being nothing to hinder the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most effect of this motion but the weight of the Fluid endeavouring to reduce it self to a Levell, which of what moment it will be in this Case I leave to be considered.</p>
                           <p>And as for its site, that renders the torrid and the frigid Zones unhabitable; intolerable Heats still burning the former, and the continual gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and dropping of the vapours making the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too cold and moist to entertain either Man or Beast. And this one concession, I am afraid, spoils most part of the Contrivance; for these por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Crust could never grow hard, being continually moistned by the Vapours, and so little expos'd to the Sun, or that breeze which attends its motion: And therefore, whenever Vapours were drawn from the Abyss in the Torrid Zone, these parts of the Arch being not firm enough to sustain themselves, must sink in; and those Vapors that were imprisoned between the surface of the Abyss and the solid part of the Crust of the Earth, might have found an easie passage through this soft portion of the Crust, and therefore could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the general dissolution of the Frame. Besides, from such a muddy Fountain what could be expected but streams unwholsome and corrupted, and unfit for that end for which they were design'd, and for that use, to which sacred Scripture tells us they were imploy'd?</p>
                           <p>A great many other inconveniences in Nature may be observ'd to follow this Contrivance; but because this Hypothesis was not set up for its own sake, but to give an intelligible account of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Floud; I shall close these reflexions with a few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations upon that.</p>
                           <p>And first the Authour pleads for an universal Floud, it being inconsistent with the demonstrated Nature of a Fluid, that Water should stand up in Heaps fifteen Cubits above the tops of the highest Mountains. This I am willing to admit, though there is no reason why Omnipotence might not be immediately concern'd in this, since he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confesseth, that the forty days Rain cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Hypothesis be explain'd by any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cause that he can find out.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, He compares the height of the Mountains and the Depth of the Sea, and having as to both made allowable suppositions (though the Course of the longest River, even the <hi>Nile</hi> it self, will not prove its head to be above three foot higher than its mouth) he infers that eight Oceans will be little enough to make an universal Deluge: The Waters above the Firmament are exploded; the Rain would afford but the hundredth part of such a Mass of Water, unless the showers were continual, and over the face of the whole Earth, and the Drops came down ninety times faster than usually they do. (Though here a Man would be apt to think from the expressions in <hi>Genesis, The Windows of Heaven were opened,</hi> that there was somewhat very extraordinary in this Rain, and that all those requir'd conditions were observ'd.) The Caverns of the Earth, if they threw out all the Water they contain'd, could afford but little in comparison of the great store that was requir'd; And if the whole middle region of the Air had been condens'd, still there had not been enough, because Air being turn'd into Water filleth onely the hundredth part of that space which it formerly possess'd. Though all the other ways by which some have endeavour'd to explain the Floud, were demonstrably insufficient, yet this last which gives an account of it from so natural and easie a Cause as the condensation of the Air deserved to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered a little more; but it is the Art of a Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to touch that least which presseth most on that Opinion which he would advance. For it being allowed that Air by natural Causes may be chang'd into Water, and a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in this very Chapter being excluded, it necessarily follows, that as much Air as riseth fifteen Cubits higher than the tops of the Mountains is sufficient to make such a Deluge as is describ'd to have been in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause where there is no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> there can be no contraction into a less space, and every particle of Matter, whatever form of schematism it puts on, must in all conditions be equally extended, and therefore take up the same Room. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or (as it happens in our imperfect condensations) that a hundred cubical feet of Air would make but one foot of Water, yet sure the Region is large enough to make amends for this disproportion: Now since Nature is sufficient for condensation, and since its powers may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably invigorated for the execution of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's wrath; why must it be thought so difficult to explain a Deluge? and why should an excellent Wit waste it self in fashioning a new World, onely to bring that about which the old one would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit easily to be done? It is above the Province of Philosophy to make a World, let that be suppos'd to have been form'd as it is reveal'd, it is enough for us to search by what Laws it is preserv'd; and a system erected on this foundation will be agreeable both at Reason and to Religion.</p>

                        <p>1 Whether <hi>Divinas</hi> is to be rendred Divining or Divine is not yet agreed by the Interpreters of the Poet; by rendring it Divine, <hi>Manilius</hi> is freed from a redundancy of Words, and the Origine of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, which he so often inculcates in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is hinted at: beside, <hi>Divinus</hi> seldom signifies Divining, but when a Substantive follows which determines it to that sense, as <hi>Divina imbrium,</hi> and the like, and in that case I find <hi>Milton</hi> venturing at it in his Poem: <q>
                              <l>—Divine of future Woe.</l>

                        <p>2 It seems very plain that this whole descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on respects onely the Eastern Kings, and therefore <hi>Manilius</hi> must be reckoned amongst those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the head of <hi>Nile</hi> to be in the East; and lest he might be thought to have forgotten the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, I am inclin'd to think he includes them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Priests,</hi> to whose care Astronomical Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations were peculiarly committed.</p>
                        <p>3 This was the Opinion of <hi>Xenophanes, Melissus, Aristotle</hi> and others; and <hi>Pliny</hi> thus concludes in the second Book <hi>cap.</hi> 1. of his Natural History: <hi>'Tis reasonable to believe that the World is a Deity <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eternal and immense, that never had a beginning, and never shall have an end.</hi> As absurd an Opinion as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>4 This blind fancy we owe to the Phoenicians, who (if <hi>Philo Biblius</hi>'s <hi>Sancuniathon</hi> may be trusted) taught that the Principles of the Universe were a Spirit of dark Air, and a confus'd Chaos; this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit at last began to Love, and joyning with the Chaos, produced <gap reason="foreign">

And hence likely the more sober part of the Greek Philosophers, (for they were but borrowers of Learning) who requir'd two eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal principles, the one <hi>active</hi> and the other <hi>passive,</hi> such as <hi>Plato, Anaxagoras, &amp;c.</hi> took their notions, and having added some few new ornaments, vented them for their own.</p>

                        <p>7 <hi>Thales</hi> the Milesian endeavoured to establish this by Arguments drawn from the Origine and Continuation of most things: The seminal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Animals is humid, Plants are nourished by mere Water; Fire it self cannot live without Air, which is onely water rarefied, and the Sun and Stars draw up vapors for their own nourishment and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. These were the considerations upon which he grounded his Opinion; and hence 'tis easie to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45711:250"/>
guess that he kept up the credit of his School ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by those riches which he gain'd by his lucky conjecture at the scarcity of Olives, than by the strength of argument and reason.</p>

                        <p>9 There is something in this scheme of <hi>Manilius</hi> so like the ingenious conjecture of the excellent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the <hi>Theory of the Earth,</hi> that what reflects on the <hi>one</hi> must have an influence on the <hi>other,</hi> and when the <hi>fiction</hi> is confuted the <hi>serious discourse</hi> will find it self concern'd: The <hi>Stoicks</hi> held the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial part of their <hi>Deity</hi> to be changeable, and that too as often as the fatal Fire prevail'd, and reduc'd the Elements into one <hi>Chaos;</hi> in such a confusion the <hi>Poet</hi> supposeth the first matter of his World, and then makes the different parts separate, and take proper places, according as they were light or heavy: agreeable to this Opinion the <hi>Theory of the Earth</hi> supposeth a <hi>Chaos,</hi> which he defines to be <hi>a Mass of Matter, fluid, consisting of parts of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sorts and sizes, blended together without any u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or connexion.</hi> The solid and heavyer parts of this Chaos descend to the Centre, by their own weight, and there fixing and growing hard, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the inward Body of the Earth; the lighter parts fly upward, and being continually agitated, make that Body which we call Air; the middle sort being somewhat heavyer, and not so much agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cover over the solid interiour Body of the Earth; and its fat and oily parts rising, and swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on the surface, stop and detain those heavyer
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45711:251"/>
particles which upon the first separation were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up by the Air, and afterward according to their several degrees of Gravity fell back again toward the Centre: These particles sticking in this oily matter, made a soft crust, which in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardned by the Sun and those breezes which always attend its motion, became the habitable Earth. This Earth thus form'd was solid, and without Caverns, nor had it any inequalities on its surface; as to its site, its Axis was parallel to the Axis of the Eclip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ick, both its Poles being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually inclin'd to the Sun; and as to its figure it was Oval. These are the few easie principal parts of that excellent Hypothesis, settled on the obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous notions of Gravity and Levity, and on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Nature, and allow'd Motion of a Fluid. And from these so many curious propositions are naturally deduced, so many difficulties concerning Paradise and the Floud happily explain'd, and all set off with that neatness and aptness of expression, and that variety of curious thought, that I am very much inclin'd to believe that Nature was never so well drest before, nor so artificially recommended. And it is pity that the first acknowledged Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Philosophy will not allow it to be true. Inherent Qualities are now generally exploded, as unphilosophical, not to be understood, and unfit to explain the Phaenomena of Nature. The Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of a heavy Body in its descent (beside a thousand other Arguments) quite overthrows Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity both as an accident of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and as essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Matter, according to the fancy of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> so that this motion proceeds onely from external impulse, and depends upon the present order of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45711:251"/>
the World. So that Philosophy will not allow the supposition of Gravity or Levity in a confus'd Chaos, since it can sufficiently demonstrate that they are neither inherent qualities, nor essential to matter, and that it is in vain to look after them, before the system of the World was settled in the present order. From this hint it is easie to infer that the supposed Chaos would have still continued such, the solid Parts would have been agitated this or that way indifferently by the restless particles of the Fluid, but there could have been no orderly separation, because no Principle of it.</p>
                        <p>But suppose such a separation, why must the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Crust of the Globe be without Caverns in its Body, and Inequalities on its Surface? What Law of Nature doth necessarily prove that in such a confusion the solid parts must be equally dispersed through the Body of the Air? If we trust our Eyes, and look upon a Dust raised by the ruin of a House, or onely consider what Confusion is, it will be very hard to find such a regular and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposition. And since these solid Bodies may be unequally dispers'd, and every one of them tends to the Centre by a direct Line, whenever they set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the Body which they compose must be une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in its surface.</p>
                        <p>Yet to let this Difficulty pass, its Figure accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Hypothesis will be much more Oval than common observation will allow, for since it is said to be Oval because the Motion of the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator is swifter than that of the Polar Circles, the figure must be almost as much Oval, as the Circle of the <hi>Aequator</hi> is bigger than the Circle of the Pole; there being nothing to hinder the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45711:252"/>
effect of this motion but the weight of the Fluid endeavouring to reduce it self to a Levell, which of what moment it will be in this Case I leave to be considered.</p>
                        <p>And as for its site, that renders the torrid and the frigid Zones unhabitable; intolerable Heats still burning the former, and the continual gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and dropping of the vapours making the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too cold and moist to entertain either Man or Beast. And this one concession, I am afraid, spoils most part of the Contrivance; for these por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Crust could never grow hard, being continually moistned by the Vapours, and so little expos'd to the Sun, or that breeze which attends its motion: And therefore, whenever Vapours were drawn from the Abyss in the Torrid Zone, these parts of the Arch being not firm enough to sustain themselves, must sink in; and those Vapors that were imprisoned between the surface of the Abyss and the solid part of the Crust of the Earth, might have found an easie passage through this soft portion of the Crust, and therefore could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the general dissolution of the Frame. Besides, from such a muddy Fountain what could be expected but streams unwholsome and corrupted, and unfit for that end for which they were design'd, and for that use, to which sacred Scripture tells us they were imploy'd?</p>
                        <p>A great many other inconveniences in Nature may be observ'd to follow this Contrivance; but because this Hypothesis was not set up for its own sake, but to give an intelligible account of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Floud; I shall close these reflexions with a few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations upon that.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="43" facs="tcp:45711:252"/>And first the Authour pleads for an universal Floud, it being inconsistent with the demonstrated Nature of a Fluid, that Water should stand up in Heaps fifteen Cubits above the tops of the highest Mountains. This I am willing to admit, though there is no reason why Omnipotence might not be immediately concern'd in this, since he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confesseth, that the forty days Rain cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Hypothesis be explain'd by any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cause that he can find out.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, He compares the height of the Mountains and the Depth of the Sea, and having as to both made allowable suppositions (though the Course of the longest River, even the <hi>Nile</hi> it self, will not prove its head to be above three foot higher than its mouth) he infers that eight Oceans will be little enough to make an universal Deluge: The Waters above the Firmament are exploded; the Rain would afford but the hundredth part of such a Mass of Water, unless the showers were continual, and over the face of the whole Earth, and the Drops came down ninety times faster than usually they do. (Though here a Man would be apt to think from the expressions in <hi>Genesis, The Windows of Heaven were opened,</hi> that there was somewhat very extraordinary in this Rain, and that all those requir'd conditions were observ'd.) The Caverns of the Earth, if they threw out all the Water they contain'd, could afford but little in comparison of the great store that was requir'd; And if the whole middle region of the Air had been condens'd, still there had not been enough, because Air being turn'd into Water filleth onely the hundredth part of that space which it formerly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45711:253"/>
possess'd. Though all the other ways by which some have endeavour'd to explain the Floud, were demonstrably insufficient, yet this last which gives an account of it from so natural and easie a Cause as the condensation of the Air deserved to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered a little more; but it is the Art of a Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to touch that least which presseth most on that Opinion which he would advance. For it being allowed that Air by natural Causes may be chang'd into Water, and a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in this very Chapter being excluded, it necessarily follows, that as much Air as riseth fifteen Cubits higher than the tops of the Mountains is sufficient to make such a Deluge as is describ'd to have been in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause where there is no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> there can be no contraction into a less space, and every particle of Matter, whatever form of schematism it puts on, must in all conditions be equally extended, and therefore take up the same Room. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or (as it happens in our imperfect condensations) that a hundred cubical feet of Air would make but one foot of Water, yet sure the Region is large enough to make amends for this disproportion: Now since Nature is sufficient for condensation, and since its powers may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably invigorated for the execution of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's wrath; why must it be thought so difficult to explain a Deluge? and why should an excellent Wit waste it self in fashioning a new World, onely to bring that about which the old one would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit easily to be done? It is above the Province of Philosophy to make a World, let that be suppos'd to have been form'd as it is reveal'd, it is enough for us to search by what Laws it is preserv'd; and a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45711:253"/>
system erected on this foundation will be agreeable both at Reason and to Religion.</p>

                        <p>12 This Argument being taken from the Eclipse and not from the increase or decrease of the Moon, the Poet must be understood, not as to divers mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Time, for the Moon at the same instant is seen Eclips'd by all to whom she appears above the Horizon, but as to the diversity of Hours at which the Eastern or Western People reckon the Eclipse to begin or end.</p>
                        <p>13 This is to be understood in respect of those who inhabit the Northern Hemisphere, to whom the North Pole is still elevated.</p>
                        <p>14 It was the Opinion of the ancient Poets, and some others, that the Sea was as a Girdle to the Earth, that it ran round it as an Horizon, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the upper Hemisphere from the lower.</p>

First-born, and the Son of his strength, and
is very troublesome in acquainting us with the
pains which he suffered at its Birth; and
then reckons up the Beauties of the Child,

he knew not when to leave off,</hi> it must be
acknowledged that this is the Case in which
it may be chiefly apply'd: We need look no

sixty Verses in reckoning up the chief Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

Whether <hi>Capricorn</hi> was in the Horoscope of <hi>Augustus,</hi> when he was Born, or when he was Conceived, Is disputed: However 'tis certain, <hi>Augustus</hi> took <hi>Capricorn</hi> for his Sign, and many times its Figure is found upon his Coins. <hi>vid.

                        <p>25. <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Orestes</hi> being taken Prisoners, <hi>Orestes</hi> was condemned to Die, but was allow'd to go and settle some Affairs, upon Condition that <hi>Pylades</hi> would stay behind, and engage his Life for his return: <hi>Pylades</hi> becomes Surety: <hi>Orestes</hi> goes, settles his Affairs, and returns at the Day appointed.</p>
                        <p>26. So call'd, because in the Sign <hi>Scorpius</hi> we see nothing but the Claws.</p>
                        <p>27. The <hi>Dodecatemorion</hi> is the Twelfth part, or two Degrees and an half of a Sign.

                           <hi>Dodecatemorion</hi>of the <hi>Moon</hi> is in the <hi>Twelfth</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Gemini,</hi> that is, in the <hi>Second</hi> of the <hi>Five</hi> half Degrees of the <hi>Dodecatemorion</hi> of <hi>Gemini.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>29. To this Method <hi>Scaliger</hi> applies this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: Let the <hi>Sun</hi> be in the Thirteenth of <hi>Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> in the Twenty Third of <hi>Scorpius,</hi> the Arch of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> between the two Planets, contains one Hundred and Sixty Degrees: In this Number there are five Thirties, which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away there remain <hi>Ten;</hi> divide these <hi>Ten</hi> by <hi>Twelfths,</hi> or <hi>two and an half,</hi> the Quotient is <hi>four</hi> Twelfths, or <hi>Dodecatemoria;</hi> of which give one to <hi>Scorpius,</hi> another to <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> a third to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn,</hi> and the fourth falling in <hi>Aquarius,</hi> shews the <hi>Moons Dodecatemorion</hi> to be in the twenty third Degree of that Sign.</p>
                        <p>30. The third sort of <hi>Dodecatemorion</hi> is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In every <hi>Dodecatemorion</hi> or <hi>Twelfth,</hi> there are <hi>five</hi> half Degrees, and the Planets (which the Antient Astrologers counted but <hi>five,</hi> not reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> amongst the Planets) have in each <hi>Dodecatemorion</hi> or <hi>Twelfth,</hi> one half De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree assign'd to every one of them.</p>
                        <p>31. From this Verse to the end of this Book, <hi>Manilius</hi> treats of the Twelve Celestial Houses, which he divides into the Four <hi>Cardines</hi> or <hi>Hinges,</hi> and the Eight Spaces that lie between these <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:</hi> The <hi>Hinges</hi> are the <hi>Eastern Point,</hi> the <hi>Middle Point,</hi> the <hi>Western Point</hi> and the lowest point of Heaven: The Spaces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but see <hi>Fig.</hi> 10.</p>
                        <p>32. <hi>Manilius</hi> in the beginning of his first Book tells us <hi>Mercury</hi> was the Inventor of that Art, which he intended for the Subject of his Astrological Poem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <hi>Manilius</hi> begins this Third Book as he did the

the Twelve Signs of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> are the
chief Disposers, and principal Governours of
Fortunes. 2. That there are Twelve <hi>Lots</hi>
belonging to these Twelve Signs. 3. He names

                        <p>1. This and the seven following Verses relate to the several particulars of <hi>Medea</hi>'s story.</p>
                        <p>2. I use this Interpretation rather than that of <hi>Scaliger</hi> and others, because I think <hi>Manilius</hi> speaks only of that famous Siege of <hi>Thebes,</hi> when the seven Generals attackt it; and as the Story says, <hi>Capaneus</hi> had almost ruin'd the Town before he was struck with Thunder.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Oedipus</hi> Married his own Mother <hi>Iocasta,</hi> and had Children by her; so that each Son was Brother to the Father, and Grand-Child to the Mother.</p>
                        <p>4. This respects the Story of <hi>Atreus</hi> and <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Xerxes</hi> is said to have dug a Channel round Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> and to have made a Bridge over the <hi>Hellespont.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. Thus, for instance, in whatever Sign the Lot of <hi>Fortune</hi> is plac'd, the next that belongs to the next Sign, is the Lot of <hi>Warfare: Civil Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments</hi> must be given to the third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. For the Lot of <hi>Fortune</hi> being in all Nativities that belong to <hi>Day</hi> to be accounted for from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and in all Nativities that belong to <hi>Night</hi> from the <hi>Moon;</hi> and those two Planets not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways possessing the same place in every Nativity, and the other <hi>Lots</hi> following the disposition of that of <hi>Fortune;</hi> it is very evident that the same <hi>Lot</hi> is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45711:308"/>
not to be always applyed to the same Sign.</p>
                        <p>8. The Poet never finisht this part, or it is now lost.</p>
                        <p>9.For instance, let the <hi>Sun</hi> be in the <hi>20th</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Aries,</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> in the <hi>10th</hi> Degree of <hi>Libra;</hi> from the <hi>20th</hi> Degree of <hi>Aries</hi> (counting thro' the following Signs <hi>Taurus, Gemini,</hi> &amp;c) to the <hi>10th</hi> Degree of <hi>Libra;</hi> are 170 Degrees: Let the <hi>Horoscope</hi> be the <hi>10th</hi> Degree of <hi>Cancer;</hi> from that <hi>10th</hi> Degree of <hi>Cancer,</hi> count thro' the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Signs, <hi>viz. Leo, Virgo,</hi> &amp;c. and you will find the Number 170 to end in the <hi>10th</hi> Degree of <hi>Capricorn:</hi> Therefore in the <hi>10th</hi> Degree of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn</hi> place the <hi>Lot</hi> of <hi>Fortune:</hi> This I take to be the meaning of <hi>Manilius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. Suppose the Sun to be in the 21, 49 of <hi>Leo,</hi> the Moon in the 26, 31' of <hi>Virgo;</hi> the <hi>Horoscope</hi> in the, 1, 0' of <hi>Leo;</hi> The <hi>Moon</hi> is distant from the <hi>Sun</hi> 325, 18', which number being distributed amongst the Antecedent Signs, <hi>viz. Cancer, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini, Taurus,</hi> &amp;c. ends in the 5, 42' of <hi>Virgo,</hi> that there is the place of the <hi>Lot</hi> of <hi>Fortune.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>11. To explain this Method which the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> us'd to find the <hi>Horoscope, Scaliger</hi> gives this instance: Let the <hi>Sun</hi>'s place be the 13, 25' of <hi>Libra,</hi> let the Birth be at the end of the <hi>Seventh</hi> Hour of the Day: Now because every Sign hath thirty Degrees, and fifteen Degrees make one Hour, these <hi>Seven</hi> Hours are three Signs and an half, or one Hundred and five Degrees: Now reckon those Degrees thro' the following Signs, <hi>viz. Scorpius, Centaurus,</hi> &amp;c. The Number ends in the 28125' of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and therefore that is the <hi>Horoscope.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="127" facs="tcp:45711:308"/>12. <hi>Sic media extremis,</hi> &amp;c. The middle Signs here are <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Libra,</hi> and these are said to be opposite to the Extremes, <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Capricorn,</hi> because in them the Days are equal, but in the others unequal to the Nights: This I take to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e the meaning of the Poet, rather than what <hi>Scaliger</hi> and other Interpreters pretend.</p>
                        <p>13. Thus in <hi>Cancer</hi> the Days are longest; in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> which is a Sign adverse to <hi>Cancer,</hi> the Nights are of the same length, that the Days were of in <hi>Cancer:</hi> The like holds in <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and so in the rest.</p>
                        <p>14. The <hi>Italians</hi> divided all the time betwixt the Rising and Setting of the Sun into <hi>Twelve</hi> Hours, and all the time between the Setting and Rising of the Sun into <hi>Twelve</hi> Hours: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, those times being various and unequal, the Hours must likewise be unequal.</p>

                        <p>1 The Poet did not think of the <hi>Palladium</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> imagines, but only of the Fire at <hi>Troy,</hi> which parted to let <hi>Aeneas</hi> go through with his Father, and his Household Gods.</p>
                        <p>2 <hi>Manilius</hi> makes only short Reflections on Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, and therefore is frequently obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>3 <hi>Romulus;</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> the Founders of <hi>Rome,</hi> were but Shepherds.</p>
                        <p>4 I chuse to read <hi>Auxissent Culmina</hi> rather than <hi>vexissent,</hi> or <hi>duxissent Fulmina,</hi> and render <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina</hi> a Cottage.</p>
                        <p>5 If <hi>Manilius</hi> be suppos'd to keep the Order of Time in his Historical Reflections, I must own I have not hit his meaning in this place; for no doubt he had an Eye upon the Wars between the <hi>Sabines</hi> and <hi>Romulus:</hi> but then I cannot imagine what those Words <hi>Captus &amp; à Captis Orbis foret</hi> mean: I cannot think with <hi>Soaliger</hi> and <hi>Huetius</hi> that he runs back to <hi>Troy,</hi> which he had left seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Verses before, and therefore apply this passage to the taking and burning of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging the <hi>Capitol</hi> by the <hi>Gauls:</hi> And 'tis certain
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45711:334"/>
the Poet in his following Reflections neglects the Order of Time very much.</p>
                        <p>6 The Stories of <hi>Mutius Scaevola, Horatius Cocles,</hi> the Virgin <hi>Claelia,</hi> and the Combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the three <hi>Horatij</hi> on the <hi>Roman,</hi> and the three <hi>Curiatij</hi> on the <hi>Alban</hi> side, are well known.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>9 He goes on with the <hi>Roman</hi> History, the unaccountable Fortunes of the Great <hi>Marius.</hi>

                        <p>10 <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, was a very notable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the variety of Fortune, being on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den rais'd to the highest, and as soon thrown down to the lowest Condition in the World.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>13 The Poet closeth his Examples with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the overthrow of <hi>Croesus,</hi> the Famous wealthy King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> who was taken by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> on the wretched Condition to which old <hi>Priam</hi> was reduc't; on the unaccountable overthrow of <hi>Xerxes;</hi> on the Advancement of <hi>Servius Tullus,</hi> who was the Son of a Bond-Woman, and yet came to be King of <hi>Rome,</hi> and on the Conduct of <hi>Metellus,</hi> who broke into the Temple of <hi>Vesta</hi> when it was on Fire, and brought out the Image of the Goddess.</p>

                        <p>Having explain'd the general influence of the
Twelve Signs of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> and given a
particular account of their interchanges with
one another, and how they <hi>incline</hi> when they
rise; after a short Preface, in which he mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
his own Industry, and unweary'd dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in this Subject: He goes on, 1. To
shew what Constellations rise with the several
Degrees of the Twelve Signs, and then what
Tempers they bestow, and to what Studies
they incline: For instance, 2. The Northern
Rudder of the <hi>Ship,</hi> riseth with the fourth
Degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> and those that are then
Born, shall be inclin'd to Sail, and prove good
Pilots: 3. <hi>Orion</hi> riseth with the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of <hi>Aries,</hi> and those that are Born under
his Influence, shall be Men of busie, active
Tempers, Solicitors, cringing Parasites and
Flatterers: 4. <hi>Heniochus</hi> or the <hi>Driver,</hi>
riseth with the fifteenth Degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> and
makes Charioteers, Horse-Racers, and Men
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45711:337"/>
skill'd in all sorts of Horseman-ship: 5. With
the Twentieth Degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> the <hi>Hoedi</hi>
or the Kids rise, and those, being wanton
Stars, produce nothing that is Vertuous or
Noble: Their Births are wanton, light, and
lustful, and never Couragious, but in pursuit
of some shameful lewd Pleasure; some of their
Births, are peculiarly delighted in feeding
and keeping Goats: 7. With the Twenty-se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> rise the <hi>Hyades:</hi>
And their Births are always turbulent and
Seditious, prone to Factions, restless Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks,
or else, they give their Minds to
Country Affairs, feed Cattle, or turn Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goners:
7. With the Thirtieth Degree of
<hi>Aries,</hi> the Goat riseth; and those that are
Born under that influence, shall be fearful,
jealous, suspicious, and inconstant, or else
inclin'd to Travel: 8. He says the <hi>Pleiades</hi>
rise with the sixth Degree of <hi>Taurus;</hi> and
the Men that are then Born, shall be gay,
and humorous, witty, but too effeminate and
soft, minding nothing but Dress, Gate, and
Love: 9. The <hi>Hare</hi> riseth with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Degree of <hi>Gemini</hi> or the <hi>Twins;</hi> and
her Births are active and nimble, fit for all
sports, all feats of activity, and slight of
hand: 10. The <hi>Asses</hi> rise with the first De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of <hi>Cancer;</hi> and those that are Born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45711:337"/>
their influence, shall be employ'd in all
sorts of Hunting and Fishing: 11. With
the twenty-seventh Degree of <hi>Cancer, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon</hi>
or the <hi>little Dog</hi> rises, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
such as weave Nets, make Spears, and
all other Instruments of Huntsmen: 12. The
<hi>Great Dog</hi> riseth with <hi>Leo,</hi> and being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Constellation of excessive heat; those
that are Born under his influence, shall be
full of Passion, Hate, Iealousie, and ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable
suspicion, and given to excess in
Wine; their Heat shall lead them on to
to dangers, and engage them to hunt wild
Beasts. 13. With the last Degree of <hi>Leo,</hi>
the <hi>Bowl</hi> appears, and inclines to plant and
dress Vines; the Births shall be somewhat
intemperate, inclin'd to Merchandise, and
to trade in those Commodities, which cannot
be brought to perfection without moisture:
14. With the fifteenth Degree of <hi>Virgo,</hi> the
<hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Ariadne</hi> riseth, and then the
Births shall be Florists; they shall delight in
making and perfuming Garlands, be Gay;
Amorous, and affect neatness in their Habit.
15. The <hi>Sheaf</hi> riseth with the tenth Degree of
<hi>Virgo,</hi> and inclines Men to look after Corn,
to build Barns, to Grind and Bake Grain,
and make it useful: 16. With the eighth
Degree of <hi>Libra,</hi> the <hi>Arrow</hi> rises, and then
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45711:338"/>
are Barn expert Darters, and good Bow-Men,
such as <hi>Philoctetes, Teucer,</hi> and
<hi>Alcon.</hi> 17. The <hi>Goat</hi> or <hi>Hoedus,</hi> riseth
with some part of <hi>Libra,</hi> and produceth Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
quick and active, fit for Business, and
covetous of Employment: somewhat loose, but
honest to their Country, and Enemies to
Knaves. 18. The <hi>Harp</hi> rising with some
part of <hi>Libra,</hi> breeds Songsters and Musici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
such as affect to Sing in Company, and
are always humming to themselves. 19. The
<hi>Altar</hi> rising with the eighth Degree of <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi>
breeds Priests, Servants in Temples,
and such as take care of and consult Oracles.
20. The Southern <hi>Centaur</hi> rising with the
twelfth Degree of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> breeds Horse-Men,
Charioteers, and Farriers. 21. With
the fifth Degree of <hi>Sagittarius, Arcturus</hi>
appears, and breeds Collectors of Customs,
Treasurers for Kings, or Stewards for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Mens Estates. 22. With the thirtieth
Degree of <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> the <hi>Swan</hi> rises;
and then are Born all kinds of Fowlers;
such as Teach Birds to speak, to sing, or to
decoy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all their Employments shall be
about Birds. 23. With some part of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricon,
Ophieuchus,</hi> or the Snake-holder ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
and produceth such as are skill'd in
curing poison'd Persons, and such as cannot
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45711:338"/>
be poison'd themselves. 24. With the last
Degrees of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> the <hi>Southern Fish</hi>
rising, breeds Anglers, Divers, Fishers for
Pearls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or at least, Traders for Fish
and Pearls. 25. With some part of <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi>
the <hi>Harp,</hi> (or rather the <hi>Strings</hi> of it,
for of the <hi>Shell Manilius</hi> hath already spoken)
riseth, and produceth subtle Accusers, Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that shall examine nicely, and determine
justly; or such as shall torture, and force the
Guilty to Confession. 26. With some Degree
of <hi>Capricon,</hi> the <hi>Dolphin</hi> riseth, and breeds
all sorts of Swimmers, such as are nimble and
active, and perform feats of activity, either
in the Water, or on Land. 27. <hi>Cepheus</hi>
rising with some Degree of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> breeds
Men of Morose Tempers, such as are design'd

them; under-Officers in an Army, and
Armor-bearers to a General. 29. <hi>Cassiopeia</hi>
rising with the twentieth Degree of <hi>Aquarius,</hi>
breeds Founders in Metals, Goldsmiths,
Iewellers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 30. With the twelfth De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

The Story of <hi>Meleager</hi> runs thus: At his Birth his Mother heard one of the Destinies say, the Child should live till the stick that then lay in the Fire was burnt: The Mother snatch'd the stick out of the Fire, and preserv'd it. When <hi>Meleager</hi> was grown a Man, he with a great many others went to hunt a Wild Bore; at the same time <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talante</hi> a Nymph of extraordinary Beauty came into the Field, and had the good Fortune to wound the Bore first: <hi>Meleager</hi> fell in Love with <hi>Atalante,</hi> and having kill'd the Bore presented the Head to her: His two Uncles who were present at the Hunting thought themselves injur'd, and would not suffer a Woman to carry off their Spoil. <hi>Meleager</hi> in defence of <hi>Atalante</hi> kills his two Uncles: <hi>Melea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>'s Mother, to revenge the Death of her two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, puts the stick into the Fire, as that burnt <hi>Meleager</hi> wasted.</p>
