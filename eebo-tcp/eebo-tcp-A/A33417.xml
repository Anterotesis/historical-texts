            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The inquisition after this led me into the consideration of <hi>Gods dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> of <hi>times</hi> and <hi>seasons</hi>: and that as <hi>those</hi> are not to be neglected, wherein there is <hi>freedom</hi> for our <hi>active-duty</hi>; so neither <hi>these,</hi> wherein there is appearance of little else remaining, save only for others to be encouraged and revived by the <hi>passive.</hi> (And truly I doubt not but the <hi>divine goodness</hi> will act for our good ends, by our Christian readiness for <hi>sufferings.</hi>) And as it is thus with <hi>times,</hi> so also it is with <hi>persons</hi>: some are rather, or more decently <hi>qualifyed</hi> for <hi>this</hi> then <hi>that,</hi> at least to give <hi>example</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>These cogitations drew from me the <hi>conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> herein inclosed; which I have addressed to — because I assure my self much of your <hi>gentleness.</hi> I have already communicated them to

a very <hi>learned, reverend</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> — but I will not adventure much further in it, untill I have also your sense of the <hi>expediency</hi> of the thing. For neither to the <hi>reputation</hi> of the <hi>matter,</hi> untill it be <hi>maturely considered</hi> of, nor to any <hi>person,</hi> would I be cause of <hi>inconvenience.</hi> And indeed, if it be so well <hi>encouraged</hi> by <hi>your self,</hi> and such <hi>others</hi> of like <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi> as it is by <hi>Him,</hi> it will become me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be <hi>silent</hi> (as I conceive,) for I have a better <hi>Heart</hi> then a <hi>Head</hi> for this business. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse I have a <hi>jealous eye</hi> upon the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>; who, I doubt not, would make <hi>malicious advantages</hi> upon any colourable <hi>defect</hi> of our <hi>Clergy.</hi> I shall adde this, that those of my profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are not <hi>idle,</hi> but are <hi>confident</hi> and <hi>vigilant.</hi> And truly it were a vile <hi>shame</hi> for us of all quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, if this <hi>excellent Prince</hi> should be <hi>lost,</hi> and we not able to <hi>excuse</hi> our selves, that no means was left unattempted for his <hi>preservation</hi>; Whom I beseech God to <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>defend.</hi> To whose protection I also leave you, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I Think it gives weight and encouragement to this proceeding, both his <hi>Majesties</hi> late excellent <hi>Declaration</hi> to his Subjects; as also the <hi>Resolution</hi> of the <hi>Houses</hi> to exhibit theirs to the people.

                  <head>The Considerations inclosed.</head>
                  <p>THe streight <hi>durance</hi> his <hi>Majestyes</hi> sacred <hi>person</hi> is held under, the late <hi>Declaration</hi> of the Army, (with which the Commons have concurred,) to act without and against the <hi>King,</hi> puts it past all scruple, that the <hi>flagitious</hi> and <hi>execrable</hi> resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these men hath engaged them past re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring; and (which is yet worse) that they cannot but proceed to the <hi>deepest</hi> and <hi>utmost villanyes</hi> and <hi>impietyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is not less question of <hi>this,</hi> then of what ought to <hi>succeed</hi> it; which is, that their <hi>impudence</hi> must be encountred with a <hi>Christian courage, zeal,</hi> and <hi>resolution</hi> superiour to it: otherwise 'tis a doubt not to be slighted, that <hi>these</hi> men, and too many <hi>others seduced</hi> by them, will have a seeming
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93183:4"/>
cause to believe themselves, that <hi>Theologicall truths</hi> are more controversiall, then those <hi>Astronomicall</hi> or <hi>Astrologicall,</hi> wherein <hi>lines</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> are only fictioned, to make <hi>Schemes</hi> for Sciences and Discourse. I am not altogether free of this scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though it looks so <hi>stupendiously irreligious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Will not the whole frame of <hi>Christian verity</hi> be <hi>shaken</hi> (if not subverted,) in this <hi>Nation,</hi> when this so <hi>great</hi> a <hi>truth</hi> in it shall not be vigorously averred; <hi>That an established Magistracy is Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Minister; and ought not, cannot, with Christian profession, be deposed by those that owe obedience and allegiance to it?</hi> I am fully perswaded that it is so <hi>necessary</hi> a <hi>truth,</hi> that were it tyed to the <hi>stake,</hi> and the <hi>flames</hi> about it, even there ought we to offer our selves to <hi>vindicate</hi> it, and <hi>contend for</hi> it; or else adieu <hi>Christian-Protestant</hi> profession.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The seed of the Church was Suffering</hi>: And shall it be lost for want of <hi>suffering,</hi> after it is grown to such a <hi>perfection</hi>? The <hi>ancient Patterns</hi> must be imitated, if we expect the same benediction should <hi>preserve to us,</hi> what was so piously and gloriously <hi>planted by them.</hi> I think I mistake not my measure, this errour amongst men lyes not in the <hi>brain</hi> but in the <hi>heart</hi>: therefore <hi>Instructions</hi> want not, but strenuous <hi>Examples</hi> of Christian <hi>zeale</hi>; which (I perswade my self) will most daunt <hi>them.</hi> For those believe, what they <hi>want</hi> of us in <hi>truth,</hi> they <hi>supply</hi> in <hi>pertinacity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:93183:4"/>All this considered, is it not now <hi>seasonable</hi> (I believe it was not so <hi>till now</hi>; but because the reasons are so obvious I will not trouble you with them) for a considerable number of our <hi>learned'st, gravest,</hi> and most <hi>pious Divines</hi> (though they exceed not the number of 20 they will be enough) in a <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>sober</hi> manner (for those <hi>tart reprehensions,</hi> of which every day there wants not store, suite not the weight of this business, being rather movings of <hi>spleen</hi> then <hi>sanctity)</hi> to present unto the <hi>Houses,</hi> That a <hi>Government esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished</hi> is <hi>Gods</hi> immediate <hi>Minister,</hi> and That an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to <hi>depose</hi> it is an high <hi>impiety</hi> against God, and his known <hi>truth</hi> plainly and expresly taught us in the holy Scriptures; That his <hi>Majesty</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably <hi>Gods Vicegerent</hi> over us, and that this <hi>allegiance</hi> we owe unto Him we have attested by the oaths of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance;</hi> That not any of his <hi>Subjects</hi> can stretch forth their hands <hi>against Him</hi> and be <hi>guiltless</hi>; That they demand (according to the practice of the <hi>holyest Christians</hi> in all ages) a time and place to <hi>prove this</hi> great <hi>truth</hi> they now assert, by evidence out of the <hi>Scripture</hi>; and if this be <hi>not allowed</hi> them, then to declare, they refuse not to <hi>seal</hi> it by <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>?</p>
                  <p>I do very readily acknowledge that the qúa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications for so great an <hi>ingagement</hi> ought to be <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>serious;</hi> and that to rush into <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:93183:5"/>
(as long as God hath left us any <hi>justifiable humane means)</hi> may want as much of true <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an piety,</hi> as it may seem of <hi>prudence.</hi> God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged our nature to <hi>many</hi> and <hi>severall dutyes</hi> and <hi>functions</hi>; and each hath its <hi>severall lawes</hi> and <hi>rules proper,</hi> whereby they are so set on work, that each may attain their due and <hi>proper ends</hi>: nor is the <hi>greatest</hi> means alwayes <hi>best,</hi> when there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though <hi>lesse,</hi> yet <hi>fitter.</hi> But if I mistake not, <hi>ventum est usque ad Triarios</hi>: we must bring up the <hi>Reserve.</hi> God hath in his just judgements (upon our <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi>) permitted all our <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> endeavours to be dissipated and frustrated; we may say, Our <hi>Van</hi> and our <hi>Battel</hi> are routed: but if the courage of this our <hi>reserve</hi> fails us not, I hope we shall <hi>rally</hi> our selves again about it, &amp; by the divine goodness have a <hi>faire day</hi> of it. This will <hi>awaken all, encourage</hi> the <hi>half-spirited, corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> all <hi>honest</hi> &amp; <hi>sincere</hi> minds. Me thinks I have reason too on my side, when I believe it will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily fall into this sequence. All the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (with very little exception) will second so Christian an example. Besides most <hi>entire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milyes</hi> will be engaged; and scarce will there be <hi>one</hi> but will have a share in it. For to this point the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> will frankly concurre: diverse reputed <hi>Independents</hi> (of whom I know some much valued by <hi>themselves)</hi> will be joyned unto you: and even in the <hi>Army</hi> the Impression of it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93183:5"/>
will be notable. Nor can their present <hi>power</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the expression of so <hi>universall</hi> a sense, so <hi>piously incited,</hi> and so <hi>well warranted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereby will appear <hi>their paucity.</hi> Upon good advertisement I am assured, that they <hi>believe</hi> they have the <hi>Hearts</hi> of the <hi>greater number</hi> of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so much hath their prosperity <hi>dazled</hi> them: But of nothing am I more <hi>certain,</hi> then that they have not the <hi>fourtieth</hi> man. And an <hi>expedient</hi> like this, to let both the <hi>people</hi> and <hi>them</hi> into a <hi>view one of another,</hi> I know not. And yet also would this be further prosecuted: This <hi>attestation</hi> would be sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all the <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> and <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> (for with the <hi>others</hi> we communicate not.)

But now that they are possessed of so great <hi>power,</hi> with what <hi>impudence</hi> do they <hi>confound those,</hi> and with what <hi>impiety</hi> do they <hi>subvert this?</hi> But since in this case <hi>both those</hi> do so well accord, were it not best to set this <hi>last-named</hi> in the <hi>front,</hi> and to draw up the <hi>Civil affair</hi> to it; and though we contend for <hi>both,</hi> yet to fight under the banner of <hi>this,</hi> in some such manner as I have stated it, and by your wisdom will be disposed into the best Order?</p>
                  <p>I shall adde such a <hi>consideration</hi> more, that if it stood <hi>singly,</hi> yet in my opinion would justify and quit the cost of any <hi>endeavour,</hi> or <hi>indurance.</hi> That is, the unparallell'd <hi>sufferings</hi> of this <hi>great Prince</hi>; to which I know nothing <hi>superiour,</hi> but his <hi>incomparable vertues.</hi> Believe me, multitudes of men are mistaken, if in the point of his <hi>temporall affairs,</hi> he had not been in a much <hi>better condition,</hi> (though I confesse not in a <hi>good</hi> one,) had he timely <hi>relaxed</hi> much of his <hi>constancy</hi> and <hi>sincerity</hi> towards the Rights, preeminencies and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>Church.</hi> Neither is <hi>our</hi> obligation but very great to Him; his sufferings being for <hi>our Lawes</hi>; so unquestionably is <hi>our prosperity</hi> mixed with <hi>his dignity.</hi> Now shall this <hi>great Personage</hi> suffer <hi>imprisonment, deprivation</hi> of <hi>Majesty, absence</hi> of all <hi>worldly comforts,</hi> and minutely <hi>hazards of life,</hi> for his magnanimous <hi>stedfastness</hi> to <hi>your</hi> and <hi>our advantages</hi>; and we not struggle for <hi>Him</hi> with

our <hi>utmost endeavours? Life</hi> were inseparable from much <hi>infamy</hi> with such <hi>ingratitude.</hi> And truly in humane reason (the utmost imployment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of God (I doubt not) expects at our hands) I know no <hi>guard</hi> for his <hi>life,</hi> but by some means or other to make it manifest how <hi>dear</hi> he is to his <hi>people,</hi> and their readiness to testify how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably <hi>united Gods truth</hi> is with the <hi>cause of his Majesty.</hi> This onely next under God must <hi>awe them, preserve Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot refuse to believe that this cause, as to the <hi>Crown,</hi> will <hi>rise again</hi>: because I see not a bottom or <hi>foundation</hi> in humane reason for this <hi>surreptitious power</hi> to <hi>establish</hi> it self in the <hi>order</hi> it seems now to point at. Though I do also very fully confesse, that <hi>great mischiefs</hi> are easily under their power. But if these only were <hi>prevented,</hi> amongst which the <hi>safety</hi> of <hi>this sacred Person</hi> is of highest importance, we had no cause to <hi>repent</hi> of such <hi>pious endeavours.</hi> And should the cause of the <hi>Crown</hi> (with which <hi>Gods truth</hi> is so firmly <hi>combin'd)</hi> resuscitate without such <hi>Christian aides,</hi> little were it to the <hi>honour</hi> of the present <hi>clergy</hi> and those that now serve at the <hi>Altar</hi>: and if <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> come singly some <hi>other way,</hi> their share could be little looked after (of which truly none is more passionately <hi>tender</hi> then <hi>my self</hi>) nor were the <hi>Protestant Profession</hi> well vindicated: which (I doubt not to say) hath received a <hi>deep wound</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:93183:7"/>
(but I hope not <hi>mortall</hi>) by the <hi>unchristian</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of these <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>detestable men</hi> amongst us.</p>
                  <p>This I have offered to your <hi>candour, prudence</hi> and <hi>piety,</hi> which truly I hold in great <hi>reverence</hi>; otherwise I would not thus have <hi>exposed</hi> my self to the <hi>censure</hi> of it.

                  <p>But after all this I shall make this conclusion; and I pray believe I am <hi>serious</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> in it. Let me not be mistaken, that I should seem to <hi>reprove</hi> a <hi>slackness</hi> in <hi>those</hi> whom I think proper to take up this matter <hi>of themselves.</hi> Indeed I am not at all guilty of it. I doubt not but great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have been <hi>long since ready</hi> for this encounter; and perhaps disposing themselves to it, in a much <hi>better manner,</hi> then I have proposed. I have onely offered my <hi>opinion.</hi> Receive it I pray, <hi>as it is,</hi> I may affirme, in the <hi>weakest</hi> part of it not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some measure of a <hi>pious jealousy</hi> (as a <hi>Son</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi>) for this great <hi>verity</hi> taught and professed in it, and as a transport of that <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>care</hi> I have for the <hi>safety</hi> of this <hi>Gracious Prince,</hi> my <hi>Master.</hi> To which I shall adde, that I have had too much <hi>experience</hi> in this world to be ignorant of this frequent <hi>truth</hi> in affaires; That

            <p>You are (unquestionably) on <hi>firm ground.</hi> If you stirre an inch from it, you fall.

               <p>THe conjectures of men are strangely <hi>various</hi> (yea of the same persons) concerning the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety</hi> or <hi>danger</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> my <hi>Master</hi>: Some times their <hi>hopes,</hi> other times their <hi>fears</hi> prevail most. I should be much ashamed if I were the lest guilty of so universall an <hi>inquietude,</hi> in so justifiable an occasion, and arising from so good a ground, as a <hi>kindness</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> they owe to their <hi>lawfull Prince.</hi> I frankely give you leave to think (nor do I value the inconvenience it could draw a long with it,) that there is not that <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest</hi> expedient in the world to <hi>serve Him</hi> by, that I would not <hi>hazard</hi> my self in, to imploy for <hi>Him</hi>: nor do I know what <hi>earthly felicity</hi> it is, could be so <hi>welcom</hi> to me, as to advance a step, beyond <hi>any other,</hi> in my duty toward <hi>Him.</hi> But my <hi>present condition</hi> refuseth me the <hi>ability</hi> of any thing else, but that of <hi>invocating the favour of God</hi> for Him; and making my addresses to <hi>you,</hi> whom I take to be the <hi>figure</hi> that gives the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the sequence of a great many <hi>cyphers</hi> that follow you: And therefore I do the rather believe that a person, that <hi>signifyes so much,</hi> will the better apprehend what weight and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> have in all <hi>humane</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:93183:11"/>
and <hi>Christian actions</hi>; and that these at last will make a <hi>Conquest</hi> upon all those, that act without their <hi>Commission.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I can hardly perswade my self into (I think) the too common opinion, that the extraordinary <hi>successe</hi> and <hi>felicity</hi> that hath constantly followed your <hi>attempts</hi> (who as the saying is, seem to have <hi>hired fortune to serve you at day-wages</hi>) hath <hi>dazled</hi> that light of <hi>understanding</hi> that formerly was usuall to you. You cannot forget the <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi> on the <hi>House's</hi> part, and the <hi>Infirmityes</hi> and <hi>wants</hi> on the <hi>Kings</hi> part at the beginning of the <hi>warre</hi>; and that the complication of <hi>many favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable accidents</hi> on the part of your affairs will challenge a share in the <hi>successe</hi>; yet is there a large roome too left for your <hi>merit</hi> in <hi>Martiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi>; and you have cause enough to value your self upon a <hi>better foundation</hi> then the <hi>event</hi> of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and <hi>successes</hi> in warre. <hi>Proverbiall wisdom</hi> is not the <hi>worse,</hi> because <hi>easilyest learnt</hi>; It seldom happens that the same man is <hi>Happy</hi> and <hi>Wise</hi> together. And if that lesson also be good, That <hi>Affliction makes men understand,</hi> it is the <hi>Academy</hi> in which I have been strictly disciplin'd for 7 <hi>years;</hi> so that I must either be an <hi>egregious Dunce,</hi> or no <hi>ill Counseller</hi> for you; there being a Person scarce to be found, that lyeth under so dangerous a <hi>temptation,</hi> of <hi>seeming prosperity,</hi> and therefore fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to be advised and <hi>councelled</hi> to <hi>sobriety</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93183:11"/>
                  <hi>wisdom.</hi> Of this I do assure you I do so little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at your <hi>prosperity,</hi> and easy opportunityes of <hi>fixing</hi> your self <hi>securely</hi> in it, that if you do as much justify your love to the tranquility of the Nation by a discreet <hi>uniting</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>people,</hi> as you have been instrumentall in their long <hi>separation.</hi> I shall prize your <hi>prudence, courage, industry,</hi> and <hi>sobriety,</hi> at as high an estimate, as the sufficientest wit can deliver it in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p>I doubt not, but both of us are easily agreed in this point, That <hi>successe legitimats not a quarrell, nor the power which supports it</hi>; neither are the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>calamity</hi> of a Nation thereby <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed.</hi> We cannot but remember and observe, that it is no more then the <hi>filthyest</hi> and <hi>imperfectest creatures</hi> have heretofore effected; which have <hi>driven people out</hi> of their countryes; made <hi>desert,</hi> Ilands extremely <hi>fertile.</hi> Have not <hi>frogs</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs</hi> desolated <hi>Empyres</hi>? and other <hi>vermine</hi> ruined great <hi>Cittyes,</hi> and large <hi>Territoryes</hi>? By these means God magnifyes his own power and Justice: the <hi>Instruments</hi> remain but what they were, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality not <hi>changed.</hi> But in the acts of Gods Grace and favour to those who have been instrumentall in <hi>destructive practices,</hi> there is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>qualityes</hi>; an ejection of those <hi>vicious,</hi> and an infusion of contrary <hi>graces;</hi> and those affects and appetites, which are <hi>necessary</hi> and

                  <hi>connaturall,</hi> but <hi>misguided,</hi> are by his goodness <hi>guided</hi> to <hi>good ends.</hi> And thus was <hi>Saul</hi> from a furious <hi>persecutor</hi> transformed to a zealous <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour</hi>; from a <hi>destroyer</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to a <hi>Master-builder-up</hi> of it. No doubt but God in both had his ends by and upon <hi>S. Paul:</hi> and from my soul I wish it, that <hi>your</hi> case may have a similitude with <hi>his</hi>; that of <hi>him</hi> in the <hi>Spirituall</hi> affair, (which was the function to which he was separated) <hi>you</hi> may be a resemblance in the <hi>temporall</hi>; and from a <hi>destroyer</hi> (by Gods goodness) rendered a <hi>restorer.</hi> This in passage to those other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I intended to you.</p>
               <p>That which weighs most, and lyeth heaviest upon mens hearts is, the <hi>fear</hi> of the <hi>Kings Person</hi>; that the whole Kingdome may lye under the imputation of the guilt of <hi>violence</hi> offered to it; and that a <hi>mutation</hi> of the <hi>form of Government</hi> shall succeed it. If this be the <hi>end</hi> aimed at, then my present endeavour is to demonstrate to you, how humanely <hi>impossible</hi> it is to <hi>attain</hi> unto it. First there is no <hi>example</hi> (the necessary circumstances observed) that encourageth such an endeavour. For examine <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Storyes</hi> of all <hi>States,</hi> and you will not find so much as <hi>one instance</hi> (I pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how I propose it) that ever <hi>any people within the fifth degree</hi> (I might double the proportion) as we of <hi>England</hi> are, or in the <hi>same degree</hi> so <hi>spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a territory,</hi> were ever transformed from a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93183:12"/>
                  <hi>Monarchy,</hi> to an <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> or <hi>Democracy.</hi> Some <hi>Cittyes</hi> and <hi>petty Principalityes</hi> have somtimes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a <hi>change</hi> to those Forms; and from thence have arrived (yet not without desperate, <hi>intestine seditions</hi> and <hi>vexations</hi>) to a great <hi>Puissance</hi>: The <hi>people growing up</hi> and increasing with the <hi>widening of the State,</hi> the Governing by <hi>multitudinous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels</hi> through constant habit and practise hath not alwayes ill succeeded. But to attempt to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce such a form (which is so <hi>vitrious</hi> and <hi>brittle,</hi> and so easily carried into <hi>distemper, tumult</hi> and <hi>multitude</hi> being scarce separable) upon such a <hi>huge masse</hi> of <hi>people,</hi> as <hi>we</hi> of <hi>this Nation</hi> are, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>unexpect</hi> and <hi>undesirous</hi> of it, the matter it self in reason will be found manifestly <hi>repugnant to,</hi> and not <hi>susceptible</hi> of, such forms; nor is there a <hi>pattern</hi> to be found, to give any light of <hi>direction</hi> for the managing of such a designe. Reasons may be seduced from the accidents happening <hi>this Parliament,</hi> which well weighed and ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will afford matter more then enough to clear this question. Som-thing <hi>like</hi> an example may be produced (though rarely too) that large <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchyes</hi> have been <hi>cantonized.</hi> But that (I think) few have any <hi>sealousy</hi> is intended.</p>
               <p>The next considerable is, That the <hi>change</hi> from the ancient and long-established <hi>rule of Governing</hi> will demolish all the received <hi>rules of property.</hi> And if that inconvenience be, with difficulty
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93183:13"/>
provided for; yet the people will not expect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that with <hi>new Lords</hi> they must have <hi>new Lawes:</hi> And more then probable it is that the people will be shaken into such an <hi>apprehension</hi> of it, that they may <hi>fall upon the Heads</hi> of the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprisers.</hi> We frequently see that people are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reclaimed from <hi>customs barbarous</hi> and <hi>unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi>; how much lesse can <hi>our Nation</hi> (the <hi>best civilized</hi> the world hath known) be withdrawn from the love of <hi>Lawes,</hi> so <hi>prudently constituted,</hi> and under which they have <hi>so long</hi> continued, that the very <hi>desires</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> are <hi>assimilated</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>nature</hi> of their <hi>Lawes.</hi> The <hi>people</hi> &amp; the <hi>Lawes</hi> will alwayes be alike. Are their <hi>Lawes Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> so will be the <hi>affections</hi> of the people? <hi>Custom is a second nature, and in many things goes beyond it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon what <hi>principle,</hi> upon what <hi>authority</hi> must such a proceeding be founded? It can be no other but, that the <hi>people have the right and power to depose an established Government, erect a new form arraigne the supreme Magistrate, and execute Him.</hi> Herein is all <hi>History</hi> silent; and it will not only be disclaimed by all those you call <hi>Cavaliers</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> but also by a considerable number of <hi>Independents:</hi> the remainder then will amount to a <hi>slender body</hi> of people. So that whereas the pretence is, that the <hi>sence of the people</hi> is acted, nothing will prove to be a grosser <hi>mistake.</hi> But this embroilment in the State, especially upon
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93183:13"/>
                  <hi>this principle,</hi> will make all <hi>Kings</hi> partyes to the quarrell: Yea all <hi>States</hi> that administer <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratically,</hi> will be throughly engaged to defend their <hi>right</hi> of <hi>ruling.</hi> So that there is little question but that the greatest <hi>calamity</hi> that can befall a Nation will inevitably be drawn upon <hi>us,</hi> that is, a <hi>forrain invasion.</hi> And <hi>Trade</hi> (which nature seems to have designed our Nation most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for) will be <hi>embarred</hi> by all <hi>Kings</hi> and those <hi>States.</hi> Nor can it be expected that permission will be given to those of our Nation to <hi>Trafick,</hi> who derive themselves from a <hi>State,</hi> from whence they shall bring the <hi>contagion</hi> of so <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive a maxime</hi> to those <hi>rules of governing,</hi> where they expect <hi>commerce.</hi> Yea even <hi>popular States</hi> will abhorre so <hi>prodigious</hi> a <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>proceeding</hi>; they having been urged by necessity to use a <hi>supreme Magistrate,</hi> though for <hi>time limited,</hi> yet exempt from <hi>question</hi> and <hi>triall</hi>: whereof the ancient State of <hi>Rome</hi> gives us frequent Examples. No man sure is so mad as to search <hi>our Chronicles</hi> for a <hi>president</hi> of this nature.</p>
               <p>The consideration of <hi>Scotland</hi> will have a large share in this affair: for the <hi>Regall Rule</hi> can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no <hi>diminution,</hi> much lesse <hi>alteration here,</hi> but that it must make a notable impression on that <hi>State;</hi> and can have no other event but a <hi>disunion</hi> of the <hi>Nations</hi>; the <hi>union</hi> of which hath ever been so much <hi>considered</hi> and vehemently <hi>desired</hi> by all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93183:14"/>
our <hi>prudentest Princes,</hi> and by the most <hi>fortunate Martialists</hi> of them, (with so much fruitless losse of blood) often <hi>attempted,</hi> yet afterward by Gods providence so <hi>happily effected,</hi> and in a most peaceable manner, to the universall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of all sorts in both Nations. 'Tis not possible there can be an <hi>union</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> where there is a <hi>dissimilitude</hi> in the nature and form of <hi>Government</hi>; for they will perpetually <hi>strive one with another.</hi> Nor can a <hi>violence</hi> upon the <hi>person</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> but prepare a way to let <hi>Scotland</hi> into a <hi>quarrell</hi> undeniably <hi>just,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably <hi>necessary,</hi> for the <hi>losse</hi> of their <hi>Liege Lord</hi> and <hi>lawfull Soveraign,</hi> and <hi>unconsulted</hi> with. To this consideration of <hi>Scotland</hi> I'le joyn that of <hi>Ireland.</hi> 'Tis apparent that the <hi>Army</hi> will have more then their hands full (if <hi>Scotland</hi> slept) with the <hi>vexations</hi> and <hi>difficultyes</hi> that will arise here <hi>at home.</hi> For of the <hi>Commons house</hi> (which you call) the representative of the people, an <hi>eighth part</hi> remains not, with any countenance for the <hi>Army</hi>; nor <hi>those</hi> neither doth the <hi>awe</hi> of the <hi>Army</hi> retain <hi>united</hi> to one sense: Take also into the reckoning those who have been <hi>expelled</hi> the House for adhering to the <hi>King</hi> in this warre, which at least will be <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five parts</hi> more: the remaining part of the <hi>Lords</hi> have <hi>disclaimed</hi> to have any share in such proceeding. So that by this <hi>Index</hi> of the Nation you may see the Spirit
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93183:14"/>
of the <hi>whole body</hi> of it, the <hi>Nobility, Gentry,</hi> all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>distinction,</hi> and all of any <hi>competent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence</hi>: and I am perswaded, (besides the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successfull triall that hath been made of some persons practised and learned in the <hi>Laws,)</hi> even those of your late selected <hi>Iury</hi> or <hi>Iudges</hi> for the <hi>Kings triall,</hi> will fail the <hi>promoters</hi> of it. Indeed all things refuse them; and doubtless so will <hi>you</hi> too: when <hi>calmly</hi> and <hi>recollectedly</hi> you shall cast your eye upon so <hi>horrible</hi> a <hi>spectacle,</hi> you cannot let it long rest there. We then thus <hi>turmoil'd</hi> and <hi>disquieted, Ireland</hi> will be left to <hi>it self</hi>; or rather worse, a prey to a <hi>forrain Nation</hi>: a <hi>large</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the <hi>fertilest</hi> soile of the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> happy beyond <hi>England</hi> for <hi>number</hi> and conveniency of <hi>Ports</hi> and <hi>Havens</hi>: so that ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably with it the destruction of the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>this Nation</hi> over the <hi>Seas,</hi> and the cessation of <hi>trade</hi> must ensue; and after it, unspeakable <hi>misery</hi> and <hi>poverty</hi> to our Nation, and eternall <hi>infamy</hi> to the <hi>causers</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Very considerable also is the <hi>fashion</hi> and <hi>shape</hi> of the proceeding, which (they say) is intended against his <hi>Majesty</hi>; so <hi>ugly, monstrous,</hi> and <hi>deformed,</hi> that when it appears upon the <hi>stage</hi> to act, the <hi>horrour</hi> of it will <hi>irritate</hi> the whole <hi>Nation</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</hi> What? (for it is not otherwise appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended) that a <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Warre</hi> of that <hi>Army,</hi> that professe to act under and by the authority
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93183:15"/>
of the two Houses, should impose <hi>Rules</hi> to judge by, and <hi>Iudges</hi> for those rules too, upon <hi>those</hi> whom they have professed to be their <hi>Legislators</hi>; and that for the <hi>triall</hi> (by their own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement) of the <hi>dignifyedst Person</hi> of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>; therefore not more then any other <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittable</hi> to an <hi>arbitrary power</hi> and <hi>extra-judiciall proceeding.</hi> Who is it that after this can expect <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> or quiet possession of any thing he hath? It is said (but who almost can believe it?) that a title is derived from <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>inspiration</hi>: If it were but <hi>talk,</hi> it were but <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> and would be thought so simple, that it would not be condemned as guilty of <hi>malice</hi>; but to act under such a notion, were a plain confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that all other <hi>titles</hi> are insufficient. Nay if it be but mingled with any other <hi>pretensions,</hi> the <hi>pestilent quality</hi> of it would poison all the rest: and, believe it, the dropping of such expressions, by the <hi>unsoberest</hi> of those that call themselves of your party, hath <hi>incredibly discredited</hi> those who are indeed <hi>well-advised.</hi> Away with it then, as that which will bring the <hi>certainest</hi> and <hi>suddenest destruction</hi>; as that which will <hi>enrage</hi> the whole <hi>Nation</hi> to a <hi>furious vindication</hi> of <hi>themselves,</hi> from being considered as such a <hi>silly generation</hi> of <hi>people,</hi> that should be cousened out of their <hi>good, known,</hi> and <hi>established Lawes</hi>; and in the place of them suffer themselves to be imposed upon by <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi>

and <hi>Dreams,</hi> which every morning must be declared to be the <hi>foregoing nights legislative power.</hi> The <hi>people</hi> do already take themselves to be scornfully mocked, that they must be <hi>stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd</hi> with the <hi>defamation</hi> of so <hi>impious</hi> an act, as a violence offered to the <hi>life</hi> of their <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>anointed King</hi>; and that the act of so slight a part of their <hi>Trustees</hi> must redound to their <hi>shame</hi>; who shunning the light of <hi>established Rules,</hi> which would have guided them, (the <hi>paths</hi> they expected they should have walked in) do in this so <hi>palpably</hi> wander from their <hi>trust,</hi> and the sense of those who trusted them; and that so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable a <hi>part</hi> of them should set up a <hi>fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>fancy</hi> to be <hi>idolized.</hi> Consider the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons House</hi> (if yet it may be so called) allow (which cannot be refused) the <hi>Knights</hi> to be the <hi>Representatives</hi> of the <hi>Shires,</hi> which truly is the main of the <hi>people,</hi> you shall not find <hi>Knights</hi> for the <hi>tenth County</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> I am perswaded, not a farre smaller proportion: Is it then pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that men shall believe against <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonstration,</hi> that the <hi>people</hi> incline to you; nay that they are not <hi>diametrically</hi> opposite and bent against <hi>you</hi>? We read that <hi>God,</hi> as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of his <hi>gracious favour</hi> to his <hi>Church,</hi> hath promised, that <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens shall be nursing Fathers and Mothers of his Church</hi>; But that his <hi>Church</hi> should set up new forms, or any forms

of triall, to execute their own <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens,</hi> is <hi>monstrous</hi> and <hi>unknown</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> is lesse then an <hi>idle</hi> dream, 'tis the <hi>fiction</hi> of a dream, and so it will be esteemed not deducible out of the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures; defamatory</hi> to the <hi>Christian profession,</hi> and the nearest way to introduce <hi>Paganisme</hi> or <hi>Mahumetanisme,</hi> their <hi>Prophet</hi> practising such <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions.</hi> So that hereby as <hi>Christians</hi> is all <hi>Europe</hi> engaged, as <hi>Protestants</hi> all of our beliefe either in this or other <hi>Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last consideration that impedes the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Government</hi> is the person of the <hi>King</hi>: which we find doth unavoidably mixe it self with all the former considerations; so that the <hi>discourse</hi> of the one, will not be without the <hi>aide</hi> of the other. Yet this following hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more in it. 'Tis <hi>This King,</hi> such a <hi>King,</hi> so <hi>conspicuously vertuous</hi> and <hi>sufficient</hi>; therefore (it must be acknowledged) that hath a <hi>right</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension and <hi>clear</hi> vision of the true Interest of <hi>Kingship,</hi> which is the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>prosperity</hi> of his <hi>people</hi>; A <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>undaunted resolution</hi> and <hi>clear courage,</hi> therefore not <hi>vindicative,</hi> and farre above <hi>base</hi> revenges. Example me, in any one person, of any <hi>vindication,</hi> or disrepect, or injury, that the <hi>King</hi> can be charged with.</p>
               <p>I'le give you many instances of his <hi>placability</hi> and <hi>readiness</hi> to be reconciled (let me in a short <hi>parenthesis</hi> give you this advertisement; <hi>Revenge</hi> is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93183:16"/>
to be doubted from the <hi>people,</hi> not from the <hi>King</hi>; He alone must be, can be, your security; upon such a <hi>Prince</hi> you may rely:) A <hi>Prince</hi> of exemplary <hi>devotion</hi> and <hi>sobriety,</hi> therefore dear to all <hi>persons</hi> so qualifyed. 'Tis <hi>This King,</hi> during whose happy dayes, (no lesse then 17. years,) in which he <hi>quietly</hi> possest and ruled the <hi>Sceptre,</hi> such an inward <hi>tranquillity</hi> was joyn'd to such a <hi>security</hi> from without, and both accompanied with such an <hi>opulency,</hi> that no <hi>period</hi> of <hi>like</hi> time, with the <hi>like</hi> felicity, have the former ages deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over to us. And it is no <hi>impertinent</hi> question to ask; whether ever any other <hi>Nation</hi> ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the like. I am perswaded (and that upon no ill grounds of conjecture,) were it in the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> to elect out of the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of all their <hi>Kings,</hi> the Spirit of which of them they would have rest upon this; if they wished <hi>Him</hi> the fortune of <hi>Henry</hi> the V. yet they would not refuse his own <hi>vertues,</hi> for the most <hi>signall</hi> of any of the <hi>former.</hi> So notable an impression doth the memory of the peaceable <hi>part</hi> of his <hi>Reigne</hi> make upon the affections of his <hi>people</hi>: And such an <hi>horrour</hi> and <hi>aversion</hi> hath the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet thereof wrought in them to any other <hi>form</hi> of <hi>rule,</hi> that they look upon their <hi>tormentours</hi> as <hi>Salamanders,</hi> that only live and are cherished by the <hi>flames,</hi> that have <hi>scorched</hi> them. Is it not now high time then to stop and make a halt?

Is there not enough done to satiate the <hi>vanity</hi> and quench the <hi>thirst</hi> after military <hi>renown,</hi> when you have vanquished your <hi>Compatriots</hi> and <hi>fellow Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,</hi> and under such a <hi>Prince?</hi>

               <p>Look upon the <hi>brink</hi> of what a dreadfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice you are; and let this last, and those other considerations be <hi>seriously</hi> revolv'd by you: to which being added those weights which your own judgement can cast into the <hi>scales,</hi> undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly you will see that there is a <hi>wide</hi> distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween making a conquest over a people, (of which their own differences will lay claim to the greatest share,) and governing them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their own <hi>appetites</hi> by so small a part of themselves; and that means are <hi>easilyer</hi> found and <hi>readyer</hi> at hand to <hi>desolate</hi> and <hi>disorder States,</hi> then such as shall <hi>compose</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> them, various to long ingrafted customs, and their own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. <hi>Invisa Imperia nunquam retinentur diu.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rule is never long-lived.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93183:17"/>
declare <hi>against</hi> it; no doubt but very evidently foreseeing the <hi>fatality</hi> of such an <hi>enormous</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd attempt.</hi> But the <hi>imagination</hi> that some have, that this <hi>designe</hi> will be carried on by dispatching the <hi>King</hi> out of the way, excluding the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> (both now out of the realm) and setting up the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the <hi>people</hi> are better <hi>seasoned</hi> by this <hi>new fashion</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> is such a <hi>mockery,</hi> that it cannot be believed but the most <hi>purblind understanding</hi> will see all the <hi>shapes</hi> of the <hi>designe,</hi> when it stands but behind so <hi>slender</hi> a <hi>thred.</hi> This will not do the feat; nor will the <hi>people</hi> of this <hi>age</hi> be so deluded: wherein there are but <hi>too many</hi> (for the publick peace,) that understand <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>policyes</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> or, at least, would have it so thought.</p>
               <p>Upon the prospect of these foregoing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, (and there want not others impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant) draw a short state of the whole affair; and it will be thus, or little otherwise.

                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:93183:18"/>
whom the lawes and ordinance of <hi>God</hi> have set over you? Obey then the <hi>municipall Law</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which you were <hi>born,</hi> that hath <hi>nourished</hi> and <hi>cherished</hi> you; <hi>restore</hi> it, <hi>promote</hi> it all you can; reverence <hi>that Prince,</hi> into whose custody God hath committed both the <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>your self</hi>; who, I doubt not, will find it most conveniency to imploy <hi>your self,</hi> and the <hi>soberest</hi> of your <hi>party,</hi> in the eminentest administrations under Him: And verily I wish it. Nor do I think it in any degree reprehensible for you, or any other to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>Physicians rule, Accipe dum dolet</hi>; take this <hi>opportunity</hi> of the present <hi>anguish</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdome; restore</hi> it to its former habit of <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>peace.</hi> There is none that will <hi>grudge</hi> you such <hi>sober commodity,</hi> as may arrive to you by it.

Where <hi>Salomon</hi> speaks in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>eternall Wisdom,</hi> thereby to advertise us of (no doubt) greater <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>circumspection.</hi> God himself appoints <hi>Moses</hi> the first <hi>Prince</hi> of the politick State of the <hi>Iews</hi>; after him <hi>Ioshua,</hi> &amp;c.

Yet is the person so <hi>sacred,</hi> so <hi>delicate,</hi> that no <hi>violent hand</hi> must come

near to approach it. Wherein are the Scriptures more plain and expresse then in this particular, <hi>Touch not mine Anointed? David,</hi> before he was a King, and persecuted by a King, <hi>who can</hi> (saith he) <hi>stretch forth his hand against the Lords Anointed, and be guiltless?</hi> 1. Sam. 24.5.6. Multitude of texts there are that both justify the <hi>dignity,</hi> and enjoyn <hi>reverence</hi> to the <hi>person.</hi> And conformably it hath been the avowed <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>all ages,</hi> even under <hi>Heathen Princes.</hi> 'Tis an argument too copious for a paper to contain the reasons and instances for it; rather indeed it is too <hi>manifest</hi> to be disputed. Hath not God coupled the <hi>fear</hi> due to <hi>Himself,</hi> with the duty of <hi>reverence</hi> toward the <hi>King</hi>? Prov. 24.21, 22. <hi>My Son, Fear thou the Lord and the King</hi> (in conjunction:) <hi>meddle not with them that are given to change.</hi> Mixe not with such <hi>machinators</hi>: for a <hi>like end</hi> shall be to the offendours against both, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</hi>

The <hi>ancient constitutions</hi> and <hi>present Lawes</hi> of this Kingdome are my <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> and <hi>Birth-right</hi>: if any shall think to impose upon me that which is worse then <hi>death,</hi> which is the <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>dastardly</hi> parting from these Lawes, I will chuse the <hi>lesse</hi> evill, which is <hi>Death.</hi> I have also a right in <hi>Kingship,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Hope this paper will find you upon your <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</hi> You have my dayly and hearty <hi>prayers</hi> for it; not so much for your <hi>own sake</hi> (for I doubt not but it would be much better for you, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of your <hi>self,</hi> to be <hi>dissolved</hi> and <hi>be with Christ)</hi> but in the behalf of the <hi>Church,</hi> your <hi>friends,</hi> and <hi>poor Family</hi>: to <hi>which</hi> notwithstanding be assured, God will be mercifull, howsoever he disposeth of <hi>you,</hi> either for <hi>this life,</hi> or for a <hi>better.</hi> But if you live (as I pray and hope you will) you shall do very well to write the life and death of that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Lord</hi> and Blessed <hi>Martyr,</hi> who professed at his death, <hi>that he dyed for the fifth Commandement</hi>: &amp; to dye in the defence, &amp; for the testimony of any <hi>Divine truth,</hi> is truly and properly to be a <hi>Martyr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which I can contribute towards this work is, to communicate some few observations I made of him and from him, before and after his <hi>Condemnation.</hi> I was severall times with him, and alwayes found him in a very <hi>chearfull</hi> and <hi>well-composed</hi> temper of mind; proceeding from true <hi>Christian grounds,</hi> and not from a <hi>Roman reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution only,</hi> (as his <hi>enemyes</hi> are pleased to speak
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93183:23"/>
of him.) He told me often, It was the <hi>good God</hi> he served, and the <hi>good Cause</hi> he had served for, that made him not to <hi>fear death</hi>: adding, he had never had the temptation of so much as a <hi>thought,</hi> to <hi>check</hi> him for his engagement in <hi>this quarrell</hi>: for he took it for his <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi>; and wished he had a greater <hi>ability,</hi> and better <hi>fortune</hi> to engage in it.</p>
            <p>After his <hi>Condemnation,</hi> and the afternoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>suffering,</hi> we were a great while in private together: when, <hi>bewailing</hi> with that sense which became a <hi>true</hi> (and not <hi>despairing) penitent,</hi> the <hi>sins</hi> of his <hi>life</hi> past; the <hi>greatest</hi> he could remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was <hi>his voting my Lord of Straffords death</hi>: which though (as he said) he did without any <hi>malice</hi> at all, yet he confessed it to be a very <hi>great Sin</hi>; and that he had done it out of a <hi>base fear</hi> (they were his own words) of a <hi>prevailing party</hi>: adding, that he had very often and very heartily <hi>repented</hi> of it, and was confident of Gods <hi>Pardon</hi> for it. Then he told me, he had a great desire to receive the <hi>Blessed Sacrament</hi> (so he called it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed the next morning: asking what <hi>Divine</hi> of the <hi>Kings party</hi> I would recommend to him. I replyed, that (though many were more <hi>worthy,</hi> yet) none would be more <hi>willing</hi> to do him that service then <hi>my self.</hi> Which he accepting very kindly, told me he durst not <hi>desire</hi> it, for fear it might be some <hi>danger</hi> to <hi>me.</hi> After this,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93183:23"/>
and some conference in order to his <hi>preparation,</hi> both for his <hi>viaticum</hi> and his <hi>voyage,</hi> the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and his <hi>death</hi>; he desired me to <hi>pray</hi> with him. Which after I had performed, and promised to be with him by seven the next morning, I left him for that time to his <hi>own devotions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day I was there at the time assigned: and after some short conference in order to the present occasion, he desired me to hear <hi>him pray</hi>: which he did for half an hour in an <hi>excellent method,</hi> very <hi>apt expressions,</hi> and most <hi>strong, hearty,</hi> and <hi>passionate affections</hi>: First <hi>confessing</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing</hi> his <hi>sins</hi> with strong Cryes and Tears; then humbly and most earnestly <hi>desiring</hi> Gods <hi>Mercy</hi> through the <hi>merits</hi> of <hi>Christ only.</hi> Secondly, for his dear <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> with some <hi>passion</hi>; but for her <hi>especially,</hi> with most <hi>ardent</hi> affections: recommending them to the <hi>Divine providence</hi> with great confidence and assurance; and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for them rather the blessings of a <hi>better life,</hi> then of <hi>this.</hi> Thirdly, for the <hi>King, Church,</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> and lastly, for his <hi>enemyes,</hi> with almost the same ardour and affection. After this sending for my <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Norwich</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Owen,</hi> I read the whole <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> for <hi>good Friday:</hi> and then, after a short <hi>Homily</hi> I used for the present occasion, we received the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> In which action he behaved himself with great <hi>humility, zeal,</hi> and <hi>devotion.</hi> And being demanded after we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93183:24"/>
had done, how he found himself; he replyed, very much <hi>better, stronger,</hi> and <hi>chearfuller</hi> for that <hi>heavenly repast</hi>; and that he doubted not to walk like a <hi>Christian</hi> through the <hi>vale</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> in the strength of it. But he was to have an <hi>agony</hi> before his <hi>passion,</hi> and that was the parting with his <hi>VVife, eldest Son, Son in Law,</hi> two of his <hi>Uncles,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>T: C</hi>: especially the parting with his most <hi>dear Lady</hi>; which indeed was the <hi>saddest Spectacle</hi> that ever I beheld. In which occasion he could not chuse but confesse a little of <hi>humane frailty</hi>; yet even then he did not forget both to <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Counsell</hi> her, and the rest of his friends. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, in blessing the <hi>Young Lord,</hi> he commanded him never to <hi>revenge</hi> his death, though it should be in his power: the like he said unto his <hi>Lady.</hi> He told his <hi>Son</hi> he would leave him a <hi>Legacy</hi> out of <hi>Davids Psalmes,</hi> and that was this, <hi>Lord, lead me in a plain path.</hi> For, Boy, (said he) I would have you a <hi>plain honest</hi> man, and hate <hi>dissimulation.</hi>
            </p>
