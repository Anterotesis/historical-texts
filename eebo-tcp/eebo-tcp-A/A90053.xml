            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Articles for his new Courſe, I am firſt to informe you, that the worke was begun ſo late, and is ſo great,
<hi>viz:</hi> the plowing of five miles in length, and a conſiderable bredth, with the harrowing of it twice over, and
ſowing it with Hay-ſeed to ſord it, that there will be no firme riding on it before the laſt of <hi>July,</hi> when my
Lord intends to give a Cup of 5<hi rend="sup">l</hi> and the ſame he will do on the laſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> then ending
the Courſe for this year: But the next year (if God grant his EXCELLENCY life and health) he means to begin it
on the laſt of <hi>Aprill,</hi> continuing it on the laſt of each moneth till the laſt of <hi>September</hi> incluſively, Six moneths in all,
giving each moneth a Cup of 5<hi rend="sup">l</hi>.</p>
            <list>
               <head>The ARTICLES.</head>
               <item>1. The Horſes are all to meet at Sparton-hill-top between eleven and twelve, where the Riders are to be juſtly weigh'd, the
weight ten ſtone down-weight, by the weights (as they call them) of <hi>Aver-du-poyſe:</hi> the Horſes are to be bridled, ſadled and
ſhod. After the Riders are juſtly weighed by ſuch a Gentleman as ſhall be deſired to be a juſt Judge, not onely of the Riders
weight, but alſo to judge impartially who comes firſt to the ſtoup; another Gentleman muſt be appointed at the Twelve-ſcore-ſtoup,
to judge what Horſe is rid out of diſtance, which is a main buſineſse: and a third muſt be deſired to ſee them ſtart faire.</item>
               <item>2. The Horſes muſt be led downe from Sparton-hill, to the ſtarting-place; and there muſt be three heats, the firſt heat to
Sparton-hill, there to rub halfe an hour, and then the Judge is to give them warning to get up and ſtart: but if in that halfe-houre
they relieve their horſes with any thing but faire water, or if they ride out of diſtance, or the riders want weight, they muſt loſe the
Cup; only there is allow'd two pound for waſting. The ſecond heat is to end where they begun laſt, and two Gentlemen muſt be deſired
to ſee, not onely who comes firſt to the ſtoup, but at the twelve-ſcore-ſtoup, who rides out of diſtance, and who not: and 'twere well
to have a flag at the ending ſtoup of each heat to be let down as ſoone as the firſt horſe is paſt the ſtoup for the Judges eaſyer
diſcerning who rides within diſtance and who not: the riders muſt be weigh'd every heat, the reliefe is to be onely water, the
Rub but halfe an houre, and then the Judge is to bid them mount.</item>
               <item>3. There being three heats, he that wins the moſt heats wins the Cup, ſo he rides within diſtance, not otherwiſe, but that horſe
which is formoſt the laſt heat; this will make them ride for it. The ſtakes are ten ſhillings an horſe, and to be put into the hands of
the Judges who are to deliver them to the ſecond horſe.</item>
               <item>4. He that wins the Cup ſaves his own ſtake, the ſecond horſe ſhall have all the reſt.</item>
               <item>5. It is to be conſider'd that if any Rider whip another Rider, or his horſe on the face, or pull back anothers bridle; he ſhall
loſe the Cup.</item>
               <item>6. No by-ſtander muſt ride in with the Horſes, to face, ſtop, or turne them over, or any other way to hinder them, but muſt
ride aloofe from them. If any ſuch fault be committed, I muſt implore the Gentry to help me in the Legall puniſhing of the
offenders.</item>
               <item>His EXCELLENCY ſaith, that, ſeeing he makes this Courſe onely for the pleaſure of the Gentry, he hopes they will
take it in good part, he having no other end in it, except his Lordſhip's owne contentment. But his Excellency addes,
that he never yet knew any publike thing which was not found fault with, and that every where there be many
teachers, for if people did not find fault with every thing, they would not be thought wiſe in any thing: but
his Lordſhip is very confident he ſhall find nothing of this humour amongſt thoſe Noble Perſons whom herein he
deſires to ſerve. And he commands me to tell you, that, though this be not the Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> yet
he will alter nothing in it. Every man may put in his horſe, mare or gelding at his pleaſure, 'tis the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and ſo his that ſets up the Courſe. When any man doth the like, he may make the Law what he pleaſes. In the
mean time his Lordſhip hopes this Courſe will pleaſe you all, ſince he has no other end in it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>His EXCELLENCY further commands me to let you know, that his courſe or heats continues no longer then his
Lordſhips good liking.</p>
