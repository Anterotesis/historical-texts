            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

controverſie. Wherefore that which he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of <hi>Luther and Melancthon</hi> is plainely frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
The opinion of <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> (a man gauled
by <hi>Luther</hi>) none in a maner haue followed. With
<hi>Zwinglius</hi> he doth manifeſtly cavil. For he indeed
could haue wiſhed the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> had never

for no other reaſon, but becauſe he deteſteth the
horrible abuſe of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in ſwearing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:
a thing (alaſſe!) to familiar with the <hi>Germanes.</hi>
As for <hi>Calvin,</hi> that he ſhould little allowe of the

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:317:8"/>

the ſubtility of <hi>Sophiſts,</hi> who out of the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Latin</hi> word do impugne the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>Then comming to the <hi>nature</hi> of a Sacrament,
he bringeth forth vpon the ſtage <hi>Luther, Zwingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
and <hi>Calvin</hi> as it were skirmiſhing there-about
betweene themſelues: ſaying, that <hi>Luther</hi> would
haue the Sacramentes to be only <hi>teſtimonies ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by God, for the ſtirring vp of our faith: Zwinglius
certaine engadgings of our ſelues</hi> vnto God: laſtly,
<hi>Calvin</hi> ioining (as it were) both opinions into one,
would haue them to be <hi>ſignes of Gods loue towardes
vs, ſealing our faith; and teſtimonies againe binding vs

the <hi>Ieſuite</hi> would faine ſhew his auditors a

            <p>The conſent of <hi>Calvin</hi> &amp; <hi>Luther</hi> in this point
is ſo evident,<note place="margin">Of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and force of a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> that it needes no proofe. That the

is, by reaſon of the fraile faith &amp; life of man it is
now come to paſſe, that wrightings though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed

a ſeale, becauſe without any ſacrament it is of
ſufficient authority? whatſoeuer is in it ſelfe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticke,

A ſeale is the viſible ſigne of any writting, whoſe
vſe is not ſo much to adde authority, as to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vs of the truth. Such a ſigne is not the word
of God. But it is more fitly compared vnto
wrightings, becauſe therein God inſtructeth his
Church in his will, &amp; doth as it were bequeath

vnto it certaine goods, or good things. It hath in
it ſelfe authority from God the author; the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are thereunto added as ſeales, not (as you
ſuppoſe) that from them it might receiue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but that by them God might ſtrengthen our

world we were predeſtinated,</hi> Thus farre the <hi>Ieſuite,</hi>
but all impudently &amp; without ſhame. For <hi>Caluin</hi>
in neither place ſpeaketh one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or the grace of predeſtination. Only in the
former this he ſaith: <hi>Inſants are for this reaſon bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
becauſe they are heires of the promiſe. For vnleſſe
the promiſe of life did before pertaine vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that man
ſhould prophane baptiſme, whoſoeuer did but miniſter it
vnto them.</hi> In the latter theſe are his wordes. <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
baptiſme be the hand-wrighting of that mutuall
obligation which is betweene God &amp; vs, yet the eſpeciall
vſe thereof is, to aſſure vs of free remiſſion of our ſinnes,
and perpetuall grace of adoption.</hi> But is this to deny
that ſacraments are <hi>ſeales</hi> of the promiſe of preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:317:14"/>
iuſtification? Is this to reſtraine ſacraments one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

But this is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> truſt and fidelity in citing
the wordes and ſentences of the Fathers and our
Doctors. Such are his two whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> volumes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,

which if the learned ſhall vouchſafe in courteſie

left as as dry as a kexe. But to the purpoſe.
<hi>That the ſacraments are ſeales of our eternall election,</hi>
although I deny not but that in the lawfull vſing
and worthy receiuing of them it is moſt true yet
remember I not, that <hi>Caluin</hi> hath any where thus

to be ſeales of our election: which alſo
is altogether falſe. But the ſimple &amp; naked truth
of <hi>Calvines</hi> doctrine is this. <hi>Sacraments profite bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

grace vnto the worthy receiuer, not in regard eyther of
the worke wrought, or the deſerte of the worker, but in
reſpecte of the promiſe of God inſtituting or ordaininge
them, as alſo through the faith of the worthy receiuer.</hi>
And here by <hi>grace</hi> he vnderſtandeth euen our
ſaluation it ſelfe, together with all the precedent
cauſes, meanes, and conſequentes thereof, ſuch
as are, our free election, remiſſion of ſinnes, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
ſanctification, and life eternall: So that
by the name of <hi>grace</hi> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſeth, both <hi>grace paſt

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:317:14"/>
and to come,</hi> but eſpecially that which is there in
the ſacramente exhibited and preſent. For euen
our election before the world was, is ſealed and
and aſſured vnto vs by the ſacraments, not as it
is from aleternities decreed by God, or as a thing
done heretofore and paſt, but as the preſent and
conſtante decree of God reuealed in the Goſpell
concerning our ſaluation in Chriſt, and by the
ſame ſacramentes everlaſting life is confirmed
not as a future good, but as already we haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>

For if a ſacrament be a diuine oath &amp; ſeale,

builded forſooth on the ſeales not of preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t grace
but onely of election already paſt, we haue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
battered. The reſt is anſwered in a worde:
that ſacraments do promiſe and ſeale vnto vs the
grace of God, if they be in their right vſe: which is
not, when they are received by the reprobate.
This only might ſuffice to cauſe the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> cavill

            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:317:19"/>
A ſacrament doeth not become falſe, though
ſometimes it bee in vaine miniſtred vnto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
making ſhew of faith. For in it ſelfe it ſtil
remaineth a ſeale of grace, though not vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
becauſe they beleeue not: as the ſonne howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in it ſelfe glorious and gliſtring, yet ſhineth it
not vnto the blinde, becauſe they ſee not. For it is
a ſigne, conditionall, ſo offering and ſealing grace
vnto vs, that withal on our parts it requireth faith
&amp; converſion: which whoſoeuer bring not with
them, it neither beſtoweth nor ſealeth vnto them
any thing, neither is it vnto them a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that
is, a ſeale of grace, through their owne fault: for it
is no vſe but an horrible abuſe of a ſacrament, to
be received of the reprobate without faith. The

by <hi>Lombard</hi> his owne confeſsion, <hi>baptiſme is alike

becauſe to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> a reprobate, but profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Apoſtolique faith, he in Gods name oſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
grace, and to his power ſealed it by baptiſme?
But this he did not abſolutely, but with conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
if he truely beleeued: as <hi>Phillip</hi> ſaid vnto the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,
thou maiſt bee baptiſed, if thou beleeue withall thy

nothing vnto him, as rightly faith your friend
<hi>Lombard, The viſible baptiſme did nothing profit Simon
Magus, becauſe he wanted the inviſible.</hi> Moreover
he diſcharged his duety, which was not to ſearch
the ſecrets of hearts, or ſounde the vnmeaſurable
gulfe of Gods predeſtination, but to baptiſe the
profeſſors of faith, whether hypocrites, or no. For
the church iudgeth not of things ſo ſecret, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>hart-ſearching</hi> God. The like reaſon ſerveth
for all other Miniſters, which ought to iudge of
thoſe that are to bee baptiſed, not according to
Gods predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but mans profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; Chriſts
commandement. This if they doe, themſelues are
not ſacrilegious, but the reprobate hypocrits who
vnreverently and irreligiouſly preſſe to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
            <p>But fie on that his blaſphemy, where hee ſaith,
that <hi>if ſacraments bee miniſtred vnto reprobate hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites

the Goſpell, and ſo to be ſaued. But if ſo, then

let vs graunte &amp; winke at the gloſſe, and let him
tel vs why (according to this opinion) ſome were
ordeined, that is, ſome followed Gods order and
good motions, other ſome followed it not. For
this they did either of themſelues, or through the
aſſiſtance of Gods ſpeciall grace: If of themſelues;
then hence forth let him not deny the name of a

other queſtion, to wit, why God gaue grace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſome, and not vnto other ſome; and eſcape he
cannot, but that he muſt either tye grace vnto

I haue beene wiſhed
to deliuer vnto you ſome
ſhort ſumme of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
I muſt acknowledge
my weakeneſſe farre vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſupport a burden of
ſuch waight. For this is a
doctrine ever paſt vnderſtanding not only of the

inſtructed by the voice of the Church and
power of the holy Spirit) but for a great part vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
even to the Angels themſelues, vntill it
pleaſed the ſonne of God to reveale it out of the
deepe wiſedome of his eternal father, which if all

the wits and tongues of men and angels ſhoulde
ſtraine themſelues to vnfold and grace with curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
of ſtile and depth of invention, they coulde
never be able to ſpeake any thing correſpondent
to the dignity and deſerte of ſo diuine a ſubiect.
Being therefore to my ſelfe guilty of mine owne

But Chriſt in 21. of <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. v. draweth this place
to a confeſſion, in which ſence it agreeth to vs al,
euen as many as thincke or ſpeake ought of God.
For we are infantes in vnderſtanding &amp; vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of all heauenly things. Wee learne in this
life ſome ſmale rudiments of them, as truly and
religiouſly ſaith the Emperour <hi>Gratian</hi> in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
to <hi>Ambroſe: Wee ſpeake of God ſo much, not
as we ought, but as we can.</hi> Yea even the Prophets
and Apoſtles confeſſe as much of them ſelues.
As 1 Cor. 13. 9. <hi>Wee know imperfectly &amp; we prophecie
imperfectly. But when that which is perfect ſhall come,
then that which is vnperfect ſhall be aboliſhed.</hi> And in
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then ſhall wee ſee face to face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though both thoſe rudiments which wee
learne be feawe, &amp; the word of preachinge bee
plained to our capacitie, wherein God himſelfe
ſpeaketh to vs as vnto infants, &amp; ſuffereth vs to
ſpeake like infantes of himſelfe, yet will God ſo
exact of vs in this life ſkill in this doctrine of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
that otherwiſe he giueth vs no hope of an
other life, &amp; theſe rudiments (how ſimple ſo
euer) do ſo farre exceede all humaine wiſedome,
that betwixt the one and the other is no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.
For theſe principles or groundes are a wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

of GOD is ſufficient though there
were no other reaſon beſides. But ſince it hath
pleaſed our merciful God to yeeld vnto our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
ſome reaſons why he hath giuen vs this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
it behoueth vs to conſider of them
with all reuerence. Now God teacheth vs that we
muſt therefore learne this doctrine, becauſe by
knowledge thereof, &amp; no other meanes, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
to convert &amp; ſaue all thoſe, who through
age are able to vnderſtand, and amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch
as ſhal be heires of eternall life. It is a confident &amp;
ſtrange ſaying of Saint <hi>Paule</hi> Rom. 1. 16. <hi>The goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
is the power of God vnto ſalvation to every one that
beleeveth.</hi> And 1. <hi>Cor. 1. 18. For the preaching of the
croſſe is to them that periſh fooliſhneſſe: but to vs which
are ſaved it is the power of God.</hi> And in the ſame
chapter the 21. v. <hi>It pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of
preaching to ſaue them that beleeue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this opinion as it is delivered &amp; confirmed
by many &amp; weighty teſtimonies of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:<note place="margin">Of the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and power of the holie ſpirit by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Swencke-feldians.</note>
ſo it is very forcibly impugned by the Devill.
For the Father of lyes ſeeing that this paradox of
the fooliſh preaching of the croſſe did not a little
poſſeſſe the mindes of men, tooke occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
brainſicke heads to ſay that this our teaching
was in no wiſe a meane to convert ſoules, but that
God without meanes did imparte and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
himſelfe to vs, and that we did but make an
idoll of our own words, and here they power out
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:317:39"/>
wonderful words, ſeeming in ſhew very glorious.
But harken (I pray you) and conſider vpon what
grounds they ſtand. God (ſay they) needeth not
at all this voice of ours, either miniſtry, reading, or
meditation, to convert men: therefore he vſeth
no ſuch meane, neither is the learning therof ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now therfore (I ſpeake to you
which are children) is there any amongſt you of
ſo ſhallow and childiſh conceite which will not
ſkorne him that ſhal reaſon in this ſort? God by
his omnipotency can eaſily bring to paſſe, that a
man without bookes, or teachers, or ſtudy may
become learned (as the Apoſtles &amp; others in the
primitiue church did ſpeake with tongues which
they neuer learned) he can make the earth fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
without labour of the husband-man, hee can
ſuſteine mans nature without meate, as hee did
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> forty daies: and therefore it is a
labour vnneceſſary, (not a meanes to compaſſe
what we wiſh and expect) either for ſchollers to
buſie themſelues about bookes and ſtudy, and to
go to their inſtructors &amp; ſchooles, or for huſband
men to manure their grounde, or for any of vs to
ſpend our life in ſuſteining our life. Doe you ſee
vpon what rockes of blindneſſe and diſtraction
the Divell doth driue theſe vnhappy men, who
hauing neuer learned the grounds of godlines or
good artes, nor loving the labour &amp; toile of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
would notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ſeeme what they are
not, deſiring to extol the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

miracles is this, to ſhew that the order of nature
(wherin he is powerfull) was by him before crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

know further, that the conuertinge of ſoules is

why it hath ſo pleaſed him, although he need not

wherin we now behould God, and know his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
hence he admoniſheth vs of the greateneſſe
of our fal, whereby it is come to paſſe that now we
enioy not the preſence of God, dealing with vs as
it were a far of &amp; by interpreters, ſtirring vs vp to
aſpire vnto that heavenly ſchoole wherein God
will be ſeene of vs face to face, and ſhal be al in al.
Beſides God in this life will haue the ſearching,
meditation, and confeſſion of this doctrine tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
himſelfe and his will, not to bee concealed
in the mindes of men, but to bee openly ſounded

the reading, hearing, and knowing of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
to be a neceſſary inſtrument of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
not in reſpect of GOD, but in regarde
of our ſelues: not becauſe GOD coulde not
otherwiſe haue converted vs (as the builder
cannot builde an houſe without his tooles) but
becauſe he would not otherwiſe doe it. True faith
is indeede the gift and worke of none but GOD

That mans conceipt of God is too contumelious

               <hi>Fiftlie,</hi> Incredulity either ſhal go for no ſinne; or
if it be a ſinne, then all ſinnes ſhall not be purged
by the death of Chriſt: or if all be cleanſed, at leaſt
the ſinne of incredulity ſhal be of more force and
vertue then the death of Chriſt. But to ſay either
of theſe were erroneous &amp; impious: For increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
not only is it ſelfe a ſin, but the mother &amp; nurce
alſo of al other offences: &amp; cleaveth faſt togither

               <hi>Theeues, covetous perſons,

incredulity were not the chiefe of ſins. Nay
we argue the clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e contrary, that they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

for ſin, becauſe they are conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned for incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity.
For tell mee what ſinne is more grievous
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:317:79"/>
and he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous then incredulitie. Heere our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtata
ſporteth and toreth ouer childiſhly. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity,
ſaith he, is not now conſidered as it is
in it ſelfe a ſin: but only as it refuſeth the meanes
of ſaluation. For what is it, Sir, to refuſe the mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es
of ſaluation? Is not this a contempt of God? Is it
not a moſt deteſtable ſinne &amp; offence? verely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulitie
is therefore a ſinne, becauſe it refuſeth
ſaluation with the meanes therof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly</hi> this their monſtrous opinion beareth
the wicked in hande that howſoeuer the truth of
the Church doctrine touching originall ſinne, &amp;
the guilt of the wicked ſtande immoueable, yet
it is at no time inherent in them, nor can truly be
attributed vnto them. For let vs take a Turkiſh
infant, or ſome barbarous ancient perſon, who
neuer heard one ſyllable of the death of Chriſt,
and therefore cannot be ſaide to haue deſpiſed it
through incredulity; now let theſe diſputers tell
vs at what time they wil account theſe to ſtand in
the grace and favor of God, to be reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, iuſtified, and ſanctified, whether in their
mothers wombe, or ſoone after their birth, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their childhood, or in their youth, whether
in their perfect age, or in their old yeares: laſtlie,
whether in their life time, or after death. Nay let
them tell vs if ever they are admitted into favour,
how they fall from it, whereas neither any ſinne,
nor actuall incredulity is able to deiect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
For the latter of theſe is not incident vnto them:
and the former are ſatisfied for by Chriſt. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:317:79"/>
they here anſwere, the effect of all will
proue that either they wil auere that ſome pleaſe
God without faith: or that ſome are caſt out of
Gods ſight and fauor without actuall incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie;
both which are falſe and impious, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
deſtroy one the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> what ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more blaſphemous, then
that God hath accepted into favor and lovingly
foſtereth and cheriſheth all the vnfaithful &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
ſuch as were <hi>Cain, Saul, Iudas, Herod, Caligula,</hi>
&amp; to conclude in a word al ſort of malefactors, &amp;

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptible,
then that thou art redeemed by Chriſts
death, reduced into amity &amp; friendſhip with him;
wheras many thouſands of thoſe, which haue bin
in like ſort reſtored, notwithſtanding periſh ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly.
My very heart quaketh and trembleth
to proſecute theſe monſters any farther. Who is
there then that thinketh not this ſo falſe an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
impious, abſurd, and blaſphemous to be far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved
and baniſhed quite out of the precincts
&amp; bounds of the Church.</p>
            <p>Here me thinkes I here them cry themſelues e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hoarſe againe; <hi>The promiſes of the Goſpell are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall:
they pertaine vnto All, they pertaine vnto Al.</hi>
We therefore firſt demand of them this queſtion,
what manner of Conſequence this is to ſay, <hi>The
promiſes are vniverſall; therefore reprobates and filthie
dogs and hogs are reſtored vnto the favour and grace of
God.</hi> Why is not the contrary rather inferred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>The
promiſes of the Goſpel haue all of them a conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith

and repentance annexed with them; therefore they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
not at all to dogs and hogs.</hi> Then againe, as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as they vrge vs with their. <hi>All, All:</hi> ſo often will
we reply vnto them our <hi>Beleeving, Beleeving.</hi> For
the promiſes indeed are vniverſall, but in regarde
of the repentant, and ſuch as beleeue the Goſpell.
And here we appeale before the whole world to

that is, faint and ſinke vnder the burthen of

And againe, elſewhere in another place:

               <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16.</note>

                  <hi>Ob.</hi> IN the doctrine of of the Lordes Supper there
are (ſay the Conſubſtantials) two extreams to
be avoided: for both every vertue, &amp; every truth ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
betweene two extremes. The one is of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes,
the other of the Sacramentaries: and on each
ſide it ſeemes to be fourfould. The errors of the Papiſtes
are. 1 Tranſſubſtantiation. 2 The worſhippe of bread. 3.
The ſacrifice of the maſſe. 4. A maiming of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
Anſ. They ſet downe indeede the errors of the
Papiſtes, but they cannot refute them: becauſe
their opinion agreeth more with the opinion of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:317:90"/>
the Papiſts, then ours doth.</p>
               <p>For firſt,<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als retaine the errors of the Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials.</note> although they teach not <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi>
yet they teach <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> whereof
there is nothing delivered in the word of God.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Whereas they teach the bodilie preſence of Chriſt,</hi> it
muſt needs be that they alſo worſhip Chriſt in the
bread, whom they ſuppoſe to bee bodily preſent
<hi>in, vnder, with,</hi> and <hi>to</hi> the bread; which is a thing no
leſſe idolatrous, then if they worſhipped the
bread. For whereſoever Chriſt is, whether in a
viſible or inviſible manner, there he is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.</p>
               <p>3 They eſtabliſh <hi>the ſacrifice of the Maſſe,</hi> becauſe,
as it hath bin already ſaid, whileſt they are bound
to worſhip Chriſt in the bread, they are enforced
to aske of God forgiuenes of their ſinnes for that
Chriſts ſake, whome they beare in their handes;
which is nought els but the Popiſh oblation of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>4 They of force admit the mangling or abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one part of the Sacrament. For they reteine
the foundation, on which the Papiſtes builde this
errour. For wheras they hold a corporal preſence
of Chriſt <hi>in, with, vnder</hi> or <hi>to</hi> the bread, they muſt
neceſſarilie either withholde the cuppe from the
Communicantes, becauſe, in their doctrine and
opinion, the bloud of CHRIST is in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
or elſe they muſt ſeparate CHRISTES
bloud from his body; then which nothing can
be more abſurd.</p>

they do the Church a double wrong. <hi>One,</hi> in
that they thruſt on her their owne words inſteed

that ſhee ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſee the diverſity of theſe two ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<hi>The bread is in the bodie;</hi> and, <hi>The bread is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
Moreover they make Chriſt a lier. For they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that the bread is his body, and ſay, that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:317:91"/>
is in the bread. Let them looke what anſwere

That which we properlie call the bodie of Chriſt was

               <p>But the bread was not giuen for vs.</p>
               <p>Ergo, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Aunſ. 3. As the bread is the bodie broken; ſo the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the bread is the breaking of the body:</p>
               <p>But the breaking of the bread is improperly and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticallie
the breaking of the bodie of Chriſt. For
the breaking of the body is the crucifying ther of.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The ſecond argument is drawne from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
Chriſt himſelfe, which is true.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This argument takes that for a grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d which
is in controuerſie: for they muſt proue that Chriſt
ſaid his body was <hi>in, vnder,</hi> or <hi>with the breade.</hi> Nay
one may ſpeake figuratiuely, &amp; yet plainely to.
Replie. 1. <hi>He is omnipotent. Ergo he can be everie
where, yea even in the bread.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Though he could make two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories
at once true, yet he will not.</p>
               <p>2. God cannot do thinges contradictorie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is truth. But to will thinges contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
is the part of a lier. We do not therfore deny
the truth and omnipotencie of God, but their
lyes; nay we defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, ſaying that God doth what
he ſpeaketh. But they oppugne it, by teachinge
that in God are contrarie willes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> 2. Chriſtes bodie hath manie prerogatiues
wherby it differeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our bodies, as namely, that it was
born of a virgin, walked on the ſea, was at one time in the

               <p>1 THe doctrine of the church, or Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

and the Goſpell of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> perfect and
incorrupt, as it is deliuered in the bookes of the
Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, by which alone God lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
men to eternall life.</p>
               <p>2. The whole doctrine of Chriſtianitie is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
in theſe two partes, <hi>the lawe,</hi> and <hi>the Goſpell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The foundation of Chriſtian religion is the
<hi>Decalogue</hi> or ten commaundements, and the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of our faith rightly vnderſtoode.</p>
               <p>4. Which is all one, if we ſay the foundation is
the doctrine of Gods nature and will.</p>

that the foundation is Chriſt.</p>
               <p>6. The church muſt needes knowe difference

7 <hi>The firſt difference</hi> is, that the goſpell of Chriſt
is only knowne in the church; other ſectes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither
ignorant thereof. All heretiques maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
errors either touching the ſon of Chriſt, or

               <p>7. The ſame is plaine by the diviſion of the
whole ſcripture into the new &amp; olde Teſtament

               <p>8. For this word couenant doth ſignifie that in

other religions either knowe it not at all, or to

               <p>12. <hi>Secondly:</hi> in the doctrine of the Prophets &amp;
Apoſtles is delivered the whole lawe of God, &amp;
that rightely vnderſtoode: other religions cutt of
the cheife points therof, namely the trew know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

to make choiſe of evil or good, and being turned

               <p>9 Therfore the ſecond degree of liberty is leaſt
of al, which is nature decaied but not as yet rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat,
wherin though there be a wil fit to perform

               <p>10 <hi>The third</hi> is in man renued but not as yet glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
in whom the will vſeth her libertie &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
partly to wel doing, &amp; partly to evil doing.
For becauſe it is regenerate by the holy Ghoſt, it
is againe inclined to obey God, but becauſe this
regeneration is not yet perfect, there remaine yet

perſevereth in that which is good, when &amp; as far

               <p>11. <hi>The fourth degree</hi> is the chiefeſt and moſt
perfect in the life eternall, or after our glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

               <p>12. This doctrine of free will muſt needes bee

            <div n="12" type="subpart">
               <head>12. OF FAITH.</head>
               <p>1. This worde <hi>faith</hi> taken in his largeſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
doth implie a certaine and ſure knowledg,
by proofe of ſuch witneſſes, as are thought vnlik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to deceaue.</p>
               <p>2. In the doctrine of the church there are foure
ſortes of faith mentioned, an hiſtoricall, a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:317:120"/>
a miraculous, and a iuſtifying faith.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Hiſtoricall faith</hi> is a knowledge perſwaded of
the truth of ſuch thinges as are ſet downe by the
Prophets and Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Temporarie faith</hi> is a knowledg of the doctrine
of the church, together with ioy conceaued vpon
knowledge of the truth, or other true or ſeeming
good things, without applying the promiſe of
grace to him that beleeueth, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
trew conuerſion or final perſeuerance.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Miraculous faith,</hi> or a faith, wherby miracles
are wrought, is a ſure knowledge by ſpecial reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Gods will, of working ſome miracle at
his requeſt or prediction, by whome it is to bee
wrought.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Iuſtifying faith</hi> is that knowledge wherby a man
doth ſtrongly perſwade himſelfe of the truth of
all Gods word reuealed vnto him, aſſuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
that the promiſe of Gods grace through
Chriſt pertaineth vnto him, and in confidence of
this fauour of God towardes him, overcommeth
all ſorrowe and feare.</p>
               <p>7. For this <hi>confidence of iuſtifying faith</hi> is a motion
of our will and heart, compoſed of ioy in the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of Gods preſent grace towards vs, &amp; hope
of future deliverance from all evill.</p>
               <p>8. There is therfore no faith but that which is
grounded on the revealed will of God.</p>
               <p>9 The holy Ghoſt worketh all faith is vs, either
by the voice of heauenly doctrine, or by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
revelation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:317:121"/>
10. But wheras it is the wil of God, ordinarily to
kindle, cheriſh, &amp; confirme faith in vs by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the church: all are bound to hearken &amp;
meditate theron.</p>
               <p>11. Many hypocrites in the church haue hade
temporarie faith: hiſtoricall faith and faith of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
is common to the good and evill: iuſtifying
faith is in this life giuen onely to all theſe that are
elected to eternall life.</p>
               <p>12. Iuſtifying faith doth alwaies comprehend
in it hiſtoricall faith: but is not alwaies ioyned
with faith of miracles: as alſo faith of miracles
hath euer hiſtoricall or temporarie faith ioyned
with it, but not alwaies iuſtifying faith.</p>
               <p>13. Faith even in the moſt godly ſorte of men
is imperfect in this life, and feeble: yet whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
feeleth in his hearte a ſerious purpoſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
and wraſtling with doubt, he may &amp; muſt
ſurely perſwade himſelfe, that hee hath trewe
faith.</p>
               <p>14. Trewfaith once kindled in the hearte
though in ſome ſorte it often faint and be obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
yet it is neuer wholy extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>15. But after this life it is changed into a more
full and certaine knowledge of God &amp; heauenly
thinges, namely a preſent feellinge and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of happineſſe with God, which knowledge
the ſcripture nameth <hi>a knowledge by ſeeinge face to
face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. Faith which is only hiſtoricall cauſeth deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
and heauineſſe of Gods iudgment,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:317:121"/>
though accidentally.</p>
               <p>17 Temporarie faith cauſeth a certaine ioy, but
not pacifying our conſciences, becauſe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
of a true cauſe; and worketh in vs confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and ſome ſhew of good workes, but only for
a time.</p>
               <p>18 Faith of miracles obtaineth thoſe miracles,
whereof it is, from God.</p>
               <p>19 Wee obtaine righteouſnes before God, and
participation of Chriſt and all his benefits, onely
by that faith which applyeth to euerie particular
man the promiſes of grace.</p>
               <p>20 True converſion and beginning of new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
according to al the commandements as it
cannot goe before this faith, ſo it cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie

that which is honeſt, and binding the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable

               <p>4 The principall differences betweene divine

himſelfe to every man.</p>
               <p>5 There be two ſorts of knowledge of God, one
ſimply &amp; abſolutely perfect, whereby God onlie
knoweth himſelfe, that is, the eternal father, ſon,

&amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wholy &amp; moſt perfectly their whole

                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:317:134"/>
6. That knowledge of God, which is in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures,
if it be compared with that, wherby God
vnderſtandeth and knoweth himſelfe, is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpted
imperfect, but if we reſpect degrees

ſimplie but in compariſon, that is, in reſpect of the

               <p>7. That is <hi>perfect,</hi> wherby the bleſſed angels &amp;

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie

<hi>Imperfect</hi> is that, whereby men knowe God in this
life leſſe then they might, and therfore by Gods

               <p>8. <hi>Imperfect</hi> knowledge is of two ſorts, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
or theological, &amp; philoſophical, <hi>Chriſtian</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is that which is learned out of the doctrine
of the Prophets and Apoſtles: <hi>Philoſophical</hi> is that
which is gathered from principles naturally
knowne, and the beholding of Gods workes in
nature.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Chriſtian</hi> knowledge is of two ſorts, <hi>Spiritual</hi>
or true, liuely, powerfull and ſauing: and <hi>Literal.</hi>
The <hi>spiritual</hi> is a knowledge of God and his will,
kindled in our mindes by the holy Ghoſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of God either reteined from the creation,

Ghoſt through the worde of God, which is not
accompanied with a mans deſire of conforming
himſelfe therunto.</p>
               <p>10. Both ſpirituall &amp; literal knowledge is either
<hi>immediate,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>11. The ordinarie meanes of knowinge God,
and that which is preſci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

enlightning, except of his owne accord
he offer it vnto vs, and confirme it by ſure &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>12. But although God hath declared in his
word how farre in this life he would be knowne
of vs, yet naturall teſtimonies of God are not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
becauſe they condemne the impiety
of the reprobate, and confirme the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
elect, and are therfore everie where alledged by
God in ſcripture, and muſt be conſidered by vs.</p>
               <p>13. But withall, this we muſt be perſwaded of
them, that they are indeede true, and agree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> they are not ſufficient
to the true knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>14. Beſides, although natural teſtimonies doe
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:317:135"/>
not teach any thinge falſe of God, yet men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the light of Gods word conceaue out of them
nothing but falſe opinions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning God, both
becauſe thoſe teſtimonies do not ſhew ſo much as
is deliuered in the worde, as alſo becauſe men by
reaſon of their natiue blindeneſſe and corruption,
doe miſtake, miſinterpret, and manie waies cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
even theſe verie teſtimonies, which by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

things as God hath propoſed vnto vs for to know

               <p>4. Two things are to be conſidered in al Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
1. Viſible, earthly, and corporal ſignes,
which are rites or ceremonies, and viſible or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
things, which God exhibiteth or offereth
vnto vs by his miniſters, and we receaue corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that is, by the partes and ſenſes of our bodie: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the things ſignifyed, which are inviſible, heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſpiritual, that is <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe and all his
benefites, which are through faith communicated
vnto vs by God ſpiritually, that is by power and
vertue of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The proofe.</hi> The diſtinction is manifeſt, by <hi>an
induction.</hi> Alſo the receauing of the ſignes is
corporall and externall: but the thinges ſignifyed are
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:317:140"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> receaued spiritually or by faith: Becauſe they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
onely vnto ſuch as beleeue; but the ſignes are no
other wiſe ratified, then the promiſes whervnto they are
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> annexed. Alſo becauſe the ſignes ſhew that vnto our
eies, which the promiſe declareth vnto our eares. As
therfore the promiſe is a vaine ſound: ſo alſo are the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vaine without faith. Laſtly, becauſe the thinges
ſignified, are the participating of Chriſt and all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.
But this can noway be graunted to any man, either
in the vſe of ſacraments, or without it, but by faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>5. The ſignes or elements are not to be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in nature or ſubſtance, but only in reſpect of
their vſe.</p>
               <p>The proofe. <hi>This is cleere by</hi> induction <hi>and ſenſe.</hi> I
baptize you with water. The breade which wee
breake is the communion of Chriſtes bodie. <hi>Here</hi>
bread and water <hi>are named in the vſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6 The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction of the ſignes &amp; the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
is not phyſical, that is naturall and reall, but
relatiue, that is to ſay, this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction is a diuine
ordinance, wherby things inuiſible and ſpirituall
are repreſented by thinges viſible and corporall,
as it were by certaine viſible wordes, and are in
the right vſe offered &amp; receaued togeather with
the ſignes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The proofe.</hi> Such is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nexion of all ſignes with
the things ſignified, that they repreſent the things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and confirme the receauing of them, for they are as
it were teſtifying pleadges and ſeals, although they be not
in the ſame place with the ſigns. <hi>The reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> is, becauſe to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:317:140"/>
make ſomething a ſigne of an other thing, is not to include
or tie the ſame thinge to the ſigne; but to order the ſigne
to ſignifie the thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, whether it be in the ſame place with
the ſigne, or in ſome other. Alſo the nature of the things
ſignified by ſacraments doth not admit this. For ſome of
them are ſpiritual ſubſtances, as the holie Ghoſt: ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
not in the ſacramental ſignes and elements, but
in the heartes of men, as the giftes of the holy Ghoſt: ſome
are diuine actions, as remiſſion of ſinnes, ſome are corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and locally in one only place, not whereſoeuer the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
are vſed: as the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The names and proprieties of the things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
are attributed to the ſignes, and contrarie the
names and proprieties of the ſignes to the things,
becauſe of the ſimilitude and likeneſſe betweene
both, or for ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the things by the ſigns,
or for the ioyned offeringe and receauinge of the
thinges togeaher with the ſignes in the lawful vſe
of the ſacraments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The proofe.</hi> The ſcripture ſpeaketh this of ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Gen. 17. 10. Act. 7. 8. Circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the league

was a ſigne of the paſſeover. Exod. 31. 14. The ſabbaoth
a perpetuall ſigne of grace and ſanctification. Heb. 9.
24. Ceremonies are ſimilitudes &amp; types of true things.
Marc. 16. 16. He that beleeveth and is baptiſed ſhal bee

to be eaten in remembrance of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>8 The lawfull vſe of ſacraments is, when ſuch
as are converted obſerue thoſe rites which God
hath commaunded, for ſuch ends as God ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the ſacraments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The proofe.</hi> That onelie is the lawfull vſe vvhich
agreeth with Gods inſtitution: but the inſtitution com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
theſe circumſtances of perſons, rites, and
endes: therefore theſe once broken, the fignes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie
abuſed. Eſa. Ier. 7. Pſal. 50.</p>
               <p>9 In this vſe the things ſignified are alwaies ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
togither with the ſignes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The proofe.</hi> For thus much the rites do ſignifie, &amp;
the promiſe annexed to the rites doth containe: as Mar.
16. <hi>He which ſhall beleeue and be baptiſed, ſhall
bee ſaued:</hi> but God is true, speaking to vs as well by

though the things be taken in one ſorte, the ſignes in an
other.</p>
               <p>10 But without the vſe appointed by God,
which is not without converſion, neither the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
haue the nature of a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor gods
benefits thereby ſignified are receiued with the

               <p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:317:141"/>
                  <hi>The proofe.</hi> The ſignes of the covenant confirme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to them which keepe not the covenant, or ſubſtitute
others in their places, or refer them to an other end: but
ſacraments are ſignes of the covenant, wherby God bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

                  <hi>The proofe.</hi> The iterating or renewing of baptiſme
is no where commaunded; the reaſon is manifeſted: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thoſe ſacraments are inſtituted to be an initiating,
or ſolemn receauing into the church which is euer firme
to him that repenteth or perſevereth. But the iteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
the vſe of other ſacraments is commaunded: as in ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
in the Paſchal lamb, in worſhiping before the arke,
in ſanctifying and clenſing it is apparent: Alſo of the
Lordes ſupper it is ſaid, <hi>As often as yee do this, yee
ſhall ſhew the Lords death. The reaſon is, becauſe
they are teſtimonies, that the couenant begunne
in circumciſion &amp; baptiſme is ratified and firme to
him that repenteth. And this often exerciſing of
our faith is neceſſarie.</hi>

of the new and olde teſtament are thoſe, which
are before ſet downe in the definition of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
The differences betweene both are
theſe, that the ſacraments of the olde teſtament
did prefigure Chriſt which was then to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:317:143"/>
the ſacramentes of the newe teſtament repreſent
vnto vs Chriſt with all his benefits, being alreadie
come: the olde were others, and more rites, as
circumciſion, ſacrifices, waſhings, the Paſcall
lambe, the ſabbaoth, worſhipping before the arke
&amp;c: the new are likewiſe others, and onlie tvvo,
baptiſme, &amp; the ſupper of the Lord: the old were
obſcure; the new are more plaine &amp; eaſie: the old
were commanded to <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſteritie &amp; their
houſholds: the new to the whole church culled
and collected out of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The proofe.</hi> That one definition ſerveth for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
of both new and old teſtament, we haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
prooued before. That there is a difference in the num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber
and forme of rites, appeareth by an induction. For in
the new teſtament it is plaine there are but two; becauſe
no other ceremonies having a promiſe of grace annexed
are commanded by Chriſt. That ſacraments of the olde
teſtament ſhewe Chriſt to come, of the newe alreadie
come, it is manifeſt by their interpretation delivered in
ſcripture, whereof we spake in their definition. They dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in plaineneſſe, becauſe in the new teſtament are few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">NOTE. Abraham had a more excellent faith then any in the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: not for plaines but for ſtedfaſtnes.</note>
and thoſe ſignifying things alreadie fulfilled, in the
olde there are more rites, and thoſe ſhaddowing future
thinges, all whoſe circumſtaunces were not yet knowne.
Laſtlie, by <hi>induction</hi> it appeareth, that the old were
commaunded onelie to Abraham and his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and their ſervauntes: the new to all even as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
as will be members of the church: as Geneſis the

               <p>15 Both Sacraments and preching of the goſpel
are Gods worde, which hee exerciſeth tovvardes
his church by the Miniſters, becauſe they teach,
offer, &amp; promiſe vnto vs the ſame communion of
Chriſt and his benefites, and are external inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the holy Ghoſt, wherby he moveth our
hearts to beleeue, and therefore maketh vs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of faith in reſpect of Chriſt and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.
Neither yet is the working of the holy Ghoſt
tied vnto theſe ſacraments; nor doe they at al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
but rather hurt ſuch as with faith do not apply
them to themſelues, as the very words &amp; rites do
ſignifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The proofe.</hi> That the Miniſters do all in GODS
name in adminiſtration of ſacramentes, and that by the
ſacraments God doth ſignifie, that is, teach, offer, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
vnto vs the communion of Chriſt, we ſhewed before
in our ſecond proofe. Whereupon followeth this other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that the holie ghoſt therby moueth our harts to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.
For becauſe ſacraments are a viſible promiſe, they
haue the ſame authoritie to confirme faith in vs, as hath
a promiſe made by word. Whence alſo followeth a third
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For that which ſerveth to kindle &amp; ſtir vp faith
in vs, the ſame alſo ſerveth to the receiving of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Chriſt: becauſe wee haue this communion
through faith. <hi>The breade is the communion of
Chriſt bodie. Baptiſme ſaveth vs, &amp;c.</hi> And yet
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:317:144"/>
the holy Ghoſt doeth not alwaies by them confirme our
faith: becauſe neither by the word doth it alwaies kindle
faith in vs; as the examples of Simon Magus and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

faith is hurtfull, is alreadie prooved in the eleventh
propoſition.</p>
               <p>16 The word and the ſacraments differ, becauſe
the <hi>word</hi> ſignifieth gods wil towards vs by ſpeach,
the <hi>ſacraments,</hi> by geſture: by the <hi>worde</hi> faith is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun

doe not without the <hi>word:</hi> without the

(if it be not by contempt) men may be both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
and ſaued: the <hi>word</hi> is to be preached to the

to the ſacraments only ſuch as God will haue vs

               <p>
                  <hi>The proofe.</hi> Sacramentes without the worde going
before doe neither teach, nor confirme our faith: becauſe
their ſignification is not vnderſtood but by preaching or
expounding them by the word: neither can a ſigne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
any thing but what is before promiſed. This maie
be proved by example of the Iewes, who either did or die
obſerue thoſe ceremonies, aboliſhing or not vnderſtanding
the promiſe of grace and of Chriſts benefits.</p>
               <p>Men of yeares cannot bee ſaved, excepte they haue
knowledge of the word, either by teaching after the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
way, or by revelation after an extraordinary waie.

Becauſe Hee that beleeveth not in the ſonne is alreadie
iudged. Ioh 3. 18. Faith is by hearing, hearing by the
word of God. Rom. 10. 17. But without ſacraments they
maie be ſaued; becauſe though by ſome neceſſarie occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they be hindred from them, yet may they beleeue, as
the theefe on the croſſe: or if they be infants, they may be
ſanctified according to the meaſure of their yeares, as
Iohn in the wombe of his mother, &amp; manie other infants
which died before the daie of their circumciſion.</p>
               <p>The word alſo muſt be preached to the wicked,

               <p>The ſacraments muſt be adminiſtred vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

that they are workes commanded of God to bee

                  <hi>The proofe.</hi> That ſacraments are workes comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

11. 4. <hi>By faith</hi> Abel <hi>offered vnto God a greater ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
then</hi> Caine &amp;c. That Sacraments are ſignes of
Gods will towards vs, it is prooved in the ſecond propoſ.</p>
               <p>18 And therefore the ſame ceremonie may haue
the nature of a ſacrament &amp; of a ſacrifice; becauſe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:317:145"/>
thereby God giving vnto vs viſible ſignes, teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his bleſſings and benefits towards vs; and wee
by receiving them doe likewiſe teſtifie our duty
towards him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The proofe.</hi> This is manifeſt by the Paſcal lamb and
other ſacrifices; alſo by the ſabbaoth: which were an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
commanded by God, whereby the godlie did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him, and ſhew themſelues gratefull to him: &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
were ſignes of Gods benefits which they receaved by
the Meſſias. So baptiſme is a profeſſion of Chriſtianiſme,
and a ſigne wherby Chriſt witneſſeth that we are waſhed
in his bloud. The Lords ſupper is a thankeſgiuing for the
death of Chriſt, and an admonition, that we are quickned
for and by his death, are made his members, and ſhall as

               <p>1. Baptiſme is a ſacrament of the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
whereby Chriſt witneſſeth to the faithfull being
baptized with water in the name of the father, &amp;
of the ſonne, and of the holy Ghoſt, that all their

therfore euer after will and muſt liue to him, and

<hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and continued by the Apoſtles; this

as an inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; as a viſible word &amp; promiſe, to

is firme and procureth ſalvation to ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and the vſe thereof, before vnlawful is now
made vnto them lawfull.</p>
               <p>15 Neither doth the wickednes of the Miniſter
make the baptiſme vaine &amp; of no force, if it bee

               <p>16 And as the covenant once begun with God
remaineth perpetually ſtedfaſt to ſuch as repent,

               <p>4 Hence hath the Lordes ſupper that firſt vſe,
which is,<note place="margin">How the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth our faith.</note> a confirmation of our faith in CHRIST,
becauſe CHRIST himſelfe by the hand of his
Miniſters reacheth &amp; dealeth vnto vs this bread

that by this token and ſigne, as by a viſible word,
hee may admoniſh vs, that he died for vs, and
that he is vnto vs the meate of eternal life, whileſt
hee maketh vs his members, and becauſe he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexeth

teſtimony moueth our minds and harts with

               <p>5 There is then in the Lords ſupper a twofold
kinde of food and drinke: one externall, viſible,

internall, inviſible &amp; heavenly, namely the

eating and receiving, the one externall, viſible,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:317:151"/>
and ſignifying, which is the corporall receiving
of bread &amp; wine, that is ſuch a receiving as is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed
by the handes, mouth, and corporall
ſenſes; the other internall, inviſible, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
which is the fruition of the death of Chriſt,
and a ſpirituall engraffing vs into the bodie of
Chriſt; that is, ſuch an eating as is not performed
with the hands and mouth of the bodie, but by
ſpirit and faith. Laſtly, there is a twofold miniſter
of this foode and cup; one externall of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
foode and cup, which is the miniſter of the
church deliuering to vs with his hand the bread &amp;
wine; the other an internal miniſter of the internal
food and cup, which is <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe feeding vs
with his owne body and bloud.</p>
               <p>6 The ſignes and elements ſerving for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of our faith,<note place="margin">The ſignes of the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> are not the body &amp; bloud of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

the bread and wine are receiued, that we may bee
confirmed in the certaintie of that celeſtiall food,
and more and more enioy it.</p>
               <p>7 Neither is the bread changed into the body
and the wine into the bloud of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of Chriſts preſence in the Lordes ſupper.</note> neither are

the thing ſignified and the ſigne, namely becauſe
the body of Chriſt nouriſheth our ſpirituall life, as
the bread the corporall life: and becauſe of the
ſure connexion of receiving the thing and the
ſigne, in the lawfull vſe of a ſacrament. And this
is that ſacramentall vnion of the bread, &amp; the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:317:152"/>
alſo the feeding on <hi>Chriſts</hi> body is of two ſortes;
the firſt ſacramentall, which is an external &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral

wine; the ſecond real, or ſpirituall, which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of the body of <hi>Chriſt:</hi>

to be engraffed into his body, as members ioyned
to the head, and branches to the vine, &amp; ſo to be
made partakers of the life &amp; death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by
it appeareth that they which teach thus are
falſely accuſed, as if in the Lords ſupper they did
admit nothing beſides the bare and naked ſignes,

becauſe baptiſme is a teſtimony of our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <p>16 The Pope hath done wickedly in taking the

parentage by diſcent, in the yeare of our Lorde,

ſtrong; but more ſtrong of minde and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
eſpeciallie after there had beene ioyned to
the goodneſſe of his nature, artes, and ſciences,
and other moſt excellent and heavenlie giftes &amp;
qualities. But touching the giftes of his body we
ſhal not neede to ſpeake much, conſidering that
ſome of them are indifferentlie common to all
men, others beſides men, are alſo incident vnto
beaſtes. For although in themſelues they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
and ſuch as every man may wel wiſh to

to giue vnto him his deſerued commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not as he was man, but a moſt abſolute Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.
But touching the vertues of his mind, which
by conſent of al good men deſerue of themſelues

true glorie, what ſhal I ſaie? whence ſhoulde I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne,

I ſhould ſooner want time then matter in ſo

do. I muſt preſcribe vnto my ſelfe certaine limites

Firſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I giue you to vnderſtand, that this our
deare <hi>Vrſine</hi> was a man abſolutely furniſhed with
manie and thoſe exceeding greate and ſingular

that with theſe moſt ſingular, exquiſite, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
giftes of witte vvas ioyned a moſt ſtricte
courſe of life, reſpecting the publique good of the
Church. Laſtly, I tell you, that his godly death
is vnto vs a moſt ſure argument both of his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganeie
of vvitte and ſtrictneſſe of life. VVithin
theſe boundes I doe of purpoſe empale my ſelfe,
that ſo you remembring this may the more eaſily
recall to memory all the reſt, and with authoritie
call me homewardes, if I offer to wander beyond
theſe liſtes.</p>
            <p>Concerning that wit whereof we ſpake, I am
verily perſwaded that this worthy man was moſt
aboundantly ſtored with many and thoſe verie
heauenlie giftes thereof: which I deſire may bee
ſpoken without offence, and taken without envy
of any man. For vvaying vvith my ſelfe that
ſtrength of wit which is naturall, I ſee not vvhat
was wanting in him that might be founde in any
man: but when I thinke of thoſe vertues where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
our wits &amp; mindes are adorned and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the ſtudies of humanitie and religion, then
me thinke I remember how by the finger of God
almoſt all were heaped vpon this one man. And
that this which I ſpeake is true, al men can witnes
who but once conuerſing vvith him haue had
experience of his ſingular vertues, vvitneſſe his
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:317:158"/>
familiar acquaintance, witneſſe his friends, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
innumerable multitudes of thoſe vvhich
haue vſed his adviſe, witneſſe many greate and

CHRISTS people hath alreadie a long time
beene fedde and recreated, albeit they like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
children, obeying the modeſt will of their
natural Father, diſſemble and conceale his name.
VVhich beeing ſo, vvhat neede I any farther
blazon the worth of ſo incomparable a wit? For
if I conſider with my ſelfe his naturall wiſedome
ioyned vnto this witte, beholde immediatelie
there are preſented to my viewe vvhole troopes
of conferences, Letters, Lectures, Sermons,
wrightings, bookes, beeing as it vvere vvhole
ſhoppes and ſtore-houſes of his wiſedome. If
at any time I bethinke my ſelfe of his inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
vvhat could a man conceiue of ſharper edge?
(as the Poe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſaid) more forwarde and ſwift? more
diligent &amp; induſtrious, then was that force, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it pleaſed almightie GOD to endue this
veſſell of holineſſe? If I reſpect that magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and quickneſſe of conceipt vvhereby all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
things he conceaved &amp; skorned, what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
on the earth did more eaſily, &amp; in the twinckling
of an eie, (as vvee vſe to ſaye) overpaſse all
thoſe thinges, vvhich to thoſe celeſtiall ſpirites
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:317:159"/>
ſeeme vile &amp; baſe, then he did? If tenacite of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
which is the continual companion of good
wittes, I finde in this man a memorie immortally
good. But after this fruitful and happie witte was
once manured &amp; husbanded by ingenuous artes
and ſciences, then indeede began he to aduance
the ſingularitie of his nature vnto a perfection far
exceedinge all others. For he trulie was ſo skilled
in all artes and ſciences, that he might worthilie
bee thought poſſeſſed with that famous circle of
ſciences, ſo much commended by auncient phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.
He was as well ſeene as any man in the
arte of pure, plaine, elegant, and true ſpeech. He
had ſo diligently and artificially vſed each part of
philoſophy, that you ſhould not take him to haue
beene a ſcholler to philoſophie, but rather philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie
to haue bin a ſcholler to him. He was moſt
skilful in the <hi>Mathematiques,</hi> he knew exquiſitly
al that pertained to <hi>Naturall philoſophie,</hi> and was ſo
excellently cunning in <hi>Moral and politique</hi> affaires,
that he might worthilie be accoumpted a ſingular
miracle of the worlde.</p>
            <p>Moreouer (to the intente that learninge this,
wee may proceede yet farther) how manie and
greate men did hee to his greate coſt viſite, that
he might throughly informe himſelf in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of theſe thinges, and perfite himſelfe by
diligent imitation. For hee viſited, hearde, &amp;
ſwallowed not onelie with eyes and eares, but
allſo with inſatiable thirſt of mynde thoſe moſt
cleere and eminent lightes of all Europe, which
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:317:159"/>
then ſhined in <hi>Wittemberge, Leipſich, Paris, and
Zurich,</hi> gathered from them all the ſweete hony
of learninge, whoſe combes are nowe extant,
delicious and wholeſome to vs for this ſchoole,
to Germanie his deare countrie, and to the whole
church of God, which is the common mother
of vs all, but bitter and pernicious to all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men and heretiques. What ſhould I heare
ſpeake of exerciſe, wherein this greate ſervant of
God and miniſter of the church did ſo greatlie
delight, that with too ſevere and ſtrict medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and exerciſe, wherevnto hee was wholie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
hee neglected all care of his bodilie
health. And this hee did then eſpecially, when
hee had ſatiſfied his minde with the knowledge
of humaine artes, leaſt perhappes that might
befall him which often befall vnſkilful fencers,
whoe a longe time flouriſh &amp; beate the aire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

others in naturall gifts &amp; ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of witt, but grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to grace that ſolid natural iuice of wit with the
floriſhinge pleaſinge coloure of humaine arts, but
greateſt, &amp; that which exceedeth all the reſt is,
when both iuyce &amp; colour are ſteeped &amp; purified
in the ſacred fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines of this diuine &amp; heauenlie
doctrine: not that our minds might anie more be
coloured as in times paſt with pure purple, but
that every one in the ſpirite of his minde may
bee renewed after the image of his creator.
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:317:160"/>
And if any man in our memorie, without doubt
this valiant champion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath performed,
laboured, and carefully perfited it. For firſt he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
and verie wiſely, that thoſe daintie orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of humanitie ought to be hand-maides vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the word of God and holy ſcripture. Then this
he laid downe for a ground, that he was not at his
owne, but others diſpoſing. Alſo he vnderſtood
that as many as addicte themſelues to the ſervice
of God, obtaine of him ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but ſuch as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themſelues from vnder his hand, doe fayle
therof. But then (good Lord!) how ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
did the meditation of theſe things breede in
the ſanctified ſoule of this Chriſtian champion?
what feare? what deſire? what zeale? He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſpro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
his faith in Chriſt, his hope, and (that which is the
bond of all perfection) his charitie: all heauenlie
vertues, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once they were rooted in him
by God the father, they could neuer be rooted
out, or corrupted by any temptation, viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fraud,
proſperitie, or adverſitie. What ſhall wee farther
ſay, if all this was not enough, but that the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
man muſt daily punniſh himſelfe? for he did
ſeuerely chaſtize his bodie to bring it to ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vnto <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It is incredible how carefull and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
hee was not to be wiſer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſobrietie was
fit for him: he did ever captivate vnto Chriſt that
naturall wiſedome wherin he excelled; he neuer
durſt determine anie thinge but out of the plaine
and knowne worde of God, he would avouch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
but what he had receaved by moſt ſure
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:317:160"/>
faith of the holy Ghoſt; laſtely he was alwaies of
this minde, that nothinge was to be altered from
the common receaued cuſtomes and opinions,
except the vnreſiſtable veritie of Gods worde did
both commaund and force. But that he might
with more certaintie compaſſe all theſe things, he
was exactelie skilled in the tongues, a moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
inſtrument amongſt others for a true diuine:
and theſe he had alwaies readie, and vſed them
whereſoeuer was neede with paſſinge dexteritie
and wiſedome. A man for iudgment moſt profu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
for prouidence wiſe, cunning to deviſe, quicke to
invent, laborious to ſearch, ſharpe to diſcuſſe,
readie to perceaue, in deliueringe a truth moſt
faithfull, in refellinge a falſhoode moſt powerfull,
farre from uanitie, diligent in all he vndertooke,
armed at all points with the complete harneſſe of
a true Diuine, a ſtronge repeller of falſhoode, &amp;
an invincible fortreſſe of defence for veritie. This
man (worthy audience) by profeſſion a diuine,
indeed a champion of Chriſt, haue we loſt, wee
haue (I ſay) loſt by the will of God this earneſt
maintainer of Gods truth, this victorious aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
of Satan; this faithfull touchſtone aud rebuke
of the fraudes and ſophiſmes which he vſeth to
plot and deviſe, this valorous vanquiſher and
deſtroyer of hereſies we haue ſeene taken from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
vs: and we all lament this moſt heavie
plague and greivous wounde inflicted on vs and
the whole church of Chriſt. But whether do I wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
Doe you not now perceaue (noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:317:161"/>
auditors) that by degrees I am fallen to the
ſecond point whereof I purpoſed to ſpeake? For
hitherto I haue giuen you to vnderſtand that this
our Doctor was a rare man for excellencie of wit,
learninge, truſt, and skill in matters of religion,
the learnedſt among divines, and moſt divine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
the learned. Now it followeth neceſſarily
that I ſpeake ſomwhat of that ſecond parte which
I propoſed, that ſo to this theorie and knowledge
I may ioyne his vertuous life and practize.</p>
            <p>The manner hereof was this: he was an other
iuſt <hi>Zacharie</hi> before God, and laboured with all
his might to ioyne innocencie of life to thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
giftes of witt beſtowed on him by nature,
arte, ane the heauenlie grace of God: I call you to
witneſſe that haue conuerſed with the man open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and familiarlie. Whatſoeuer he had of nature,
did hee not (after he had faithfully bettered it by
liberall artes, and profited it by grace infuſed from
heauen) imploy it wholie to the ſtudie and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of pietie, charitie, and humanitie? Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
will thinke it incredible, ſome enuiouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ſpoken; yet I muſt needes ſay it. I thinke this
age hath bred verie few, whoſe ſtudious part and
dutiful minde might be compared with this mans
hearte and minde. Which I ſpeake not becauſe
I woulde flatter him: for whie ſhould I flatter the
dead? nor that I yeeld too much to our freindſhip
and familiaritie, for it was a greife to me that I was
almoſt alwaies abſent from ſo worthie a man; and
now to be cutt of from all hope of acquaintance
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:317:161"/>
with him which I haue ſo much wiſhed, this is that
which grieueth me moſt of all. I ſpeake the truth,
&amp; that which in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience I thinke; I haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo much diligence of ſtudie, and ſo
much gratiouſnes of curteſie &amp; faire behavior, as
can very hardly be matched, muſt leſſe bettered
by any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And how might this be known? beeaus
in pietie, charitie, and curteſie he ſatiſfied al other
men, but never could ſatiſfie himſelfe. But who, I
pray, is there that can witnes thus much? nay who
is there that cannot witnes it, if he haue but heard
the name of <hi>Vrſinus?</hi> heard it, ſay I? nay I call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
witneſſe which know not ſo much as his name.
There haue beene manie in our memorie, which
haue moſt greedilie gathered the moſt ſweete &amp;
wholſome fruite of his labours, as from a tree vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
&amp; haue togeather with vs thirſted after
the water poured from his river and bowells by
Chriſt. It were to long to confirme theſe thinges
by examples, teſtimonies, and arguments: &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes
to ſome of you vnprofitable, to others tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.
But out of manie I will make choice only
of ſom feaw, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his plentifull panterie &amp; ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
furniſh you out a frugal &amp; thriftie ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quet.
His firſt rudime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of religion he had learned of a
child; which is a great matter. In proces of time he
encreaſed &amp; furthered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly: which
is more. But the greatſt matter &amp; moſt memorable
of al the reſt, is that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was aged (if a man of
years may be termed aged, at which years it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God to take away and extinuiſh that light,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:317:162"/>
ſhining to the teſtimonie of that true light) but
being, I ſay, aged, he as much confirmed that his
ſtudie of godlineſſe and religion, as when he did
moſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, at all times (that I may, if it be poſſible,
conclude al in a word) without meaſure or end he
was ſo carried away with deſire of godlineſſe and
reverence of his maker, and did ſo burie himſelfe
therein, that from the principles of wiſdome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
every daie very much forvvard, he in the
end attained that perfection, wherwith the moſt
righteous God hath now crowned him. And
though himſelfe procured &amp; vſed no other ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
witneſſes of theſe his moſt holy endevours
(which God very well knew and approued) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that great <hi>ſearcher of harts,</hi> God, &amp; our Lord
<hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> whom he ſerued in ſpirit: yet am I able
to alleadge two moſt evident proofes thereof,
namely his faithful praiers, &amp; ſacred meditations.
But then (will ſome man ſay) did this <hi>Vrſinus,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend, vſe to cal witneſſes about him when
he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to praier? did he offer himſelfe to the view
&amp; hearing of others as if he had beene on a thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and not in his cloſet? no truely. That moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
man, one far from al ſhew of this humaine va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
&amp; affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vaine glory, thought it alwaies
ſufficient to be ſeene in ſecret by his father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
ſeeth in ſecret, vvas verie warie in beeing ſeene of
others, confirmed himſelfe by Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praier, did
not vaunt himſelfe by phariſaicall boaſting. Do I
then gueſſe and ſpeake by coniecture? nor ſo, but
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:317:162"/>
avouch it vpon certaine knowledge. For ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
was this man of God, moſt carefull of the
truth, the church, the afflicted brethren, &amp; al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
wholie bent to faithful praier, whereby like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ioſue</hi> converſing night &amp; day in the light of
heavenlie things, he did with feruent praier ſaue
and defend the people of his charge, &amp; with the
ſword of Gods word chaſed and put to flight the
enemies of the faith. But what ſhould I ſpeake of
his meditations? We founde (ô deere <hi>Vrſine</hi>) that
thou didſt truely obſerue, what <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had
before in word &amp; deed approued, <hi>That eaſie things
were harde to bee conceived by the negligent, and harde
things eaſie to the diligent.</hi> So certaine was it that
thou thoughteſt nothing vnworthy thy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For what eaſie thing did eſcape him? What
difficult thing was there wherevnto he did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine?
Whatſoever the eternall ſpirit of God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the bookes of the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles,
all that he beleeued faithfully, ſearched diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and attained by med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

For thoſe he accoumpted the worthieſt
paines, which were beſtowed in thoſe divine ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
As often as I thinke on the greate, labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and peremptorie deſire of meditation which
was in this man, (and I cannot but thinke of it

encreaſe vvhich by little and little is gathered
together, there is not that thing ſo meane &amp; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which they that enter into that kind of know
ledge may or ought to deſpiſe. But what thinke
you of this, that there was nothing delivered by
thoſe great men &amp; principall philoſophers which
this my buſie fellow profeſſor did not by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
attaine, were it neuer ſo crabbed, deepe, and
obſcure? was he not well ſeene in the <hi>moral</hi> wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and other wrighters? was not
<hi>natural philoſophie</hi> plaine, open, and eaſie vnto him?
did hee not abſolutelie conceiue the drift and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Ariſtotles Organon?</hi> the ſubtiltie of vvhich
worke ſome flie, as deſpairing of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

it, as the fatal and pernicious <hi>Scylla</hi> or <hi>Charybdis</hi> of

vvorke <hi>Vrſine</hi> ſharpelie and ſpeedilie perceaued,
and preſented it as it were in a table to be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and peruſed by others. What ſhould I heere
ſpeake of the <hi>Mathematiques,</hi> vvhoſe foundations
are commonlie grounded on ſerious meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
mind, whoſe principles are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in axioms or
petitions as they cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Their difficult preceptes
were not vnknowne to <hi>Vrſinus,</hi> vvho by ſerious
meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not fleeting &amp; ſlender inſight, through<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
pervſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. Well then, let vs now ſee what
witneſſes we can produce for this matter. After I
haue vſed his own teſtimony, I wil then thinke of
others. <hi>Vrſine</hi> himſelf in the whole race of theſe his
too ſhorte daies, is a moſt ſubſtantial witnes of his
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:317:163"/>
owne meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; al thoſe vertues which before
I haue recited. For what duties of piety, or <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>
charity, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> curteſie did he omit? his religious
duty toward God, God himſelfe did ſee, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
&amp; ſeal, &amp; hath now at the laſt rewarded. But
becauſe the beſt vvay to knowe the tree is by the
fruit, let me (with your patience) a litle turne your
thoughts to the fruits of his godlineſſe &amp; religion.
Truly I thinke that in holy ſcripture they are the
greateſt fruits of godlines, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of Gods glory. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was this ſacred
ſoule at al wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting herevnto? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did it not ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
&amp; labor vehemently to giue light everie day
more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other to the truth, &amp; therwith to lighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
others with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verſe, that ſo it might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the foggy clouds of error? But thoſe duties of
piety are moſt neerely linked vnto charity, which
concerne both edifying of the church, &amp; the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of our neighbors. Wherfore now I wil ſpeak
iointly of both ſorts of duties, &amp; demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrate how
painful this couragious ſoldier of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did labour
by his ſpeech, his wrightings, &amp; his whole minde,
that he might not in the leaſt maner trip or wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his duty. As therfore the duties of piety &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ar between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues agreeable, &amp; vnited: ſo
alſo they liued, encreaſed, &amp; altogither ſho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e forth
of this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when he lived. For if we reſpect the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
hee vndertooke in regarde of theſe duties,
good Lord, how great was his faith? his diligence?
his faſting? his watching? for not onelie the fruits
enſuing heereon can witneſſe thus much vnto vs,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:317:164"/>
but alſo that macerating and pullinge downe his
bodie, that taminge of his fleſh, that outwarde
man worne and ſpent with sore paſſed labours,
ſo that hee died an vntimelie death. I woulde

reſpect god, that thou diddeſt no way reſpect thy
ſelfe. Alaſſe, alaſſe, deere <hi>Vrſine</hi> the light of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi>

our ſchoole, and the immortall glorie of this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<hi>Palatine,</hi> I woulde thou couldeſt haue been
perſwaded, to haue taken thy-ſelfe a little from
thy-ſelfe, and reſpited thy-ſelfe a little from thy
continuall cares, that ſo wee, this ſchoole, &amp; the
whole church might a little longer haue enioyed
thee? when I in times paſt admoniſhed thee ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to this purpoſe thou madeſt mee aunſwer,
that bodilie exerciſe did little profit: where vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
I replied that it was profitable, and that by
entercourſe it was to bee ioyned with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of the mynde, and that it was elegantly
proved by <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> to the people of <hi>Antioch:</hi>
all this I tryed with him, but to no purpoſe.
But what meane I? the Lordes will hath been
done, it is better to bee ſilent, then to reply.
Who then is there which can ſhew, that the duty
of this worthy and laborious man was ever want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either in ſpeech or wrightinge, as long as hee
was any way able to ſhew it? for mine owne part I
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:317:164"/>
know not whether the remembrance of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
paines, which hee vnceſſantly vſed in
perfourmance of theſe duties, did more greiue
me, or the conceipt of that fruite, whith without
care of him ſelfe hee dealte vnto all poſteritie
doth delight mee: although tyme may were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie
greife, but this fruit ſhall continue beyonde
all tyme. Yf I reſpect private conference, thy
mynde was an wholeſome and well ſured trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
if thy publique ſpeeches, it was the oracle of
God, at leaſt for that meaſure that may be found
in mortalitie: if both togeather, that thy divine
diſpoſinge and diſpenſinge of the myſteries of
God, doth not the brighteneſſe therof dazel
and blinde the eyes of my mynde and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge?
Thou man of God, thou well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
Divine with all the holie complete ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moure
of divinitie, thou excellent amongeſt all
divines, when diddeſt thou at anie time ceaſe
from preaching and profeſſing of the truth? when
diddeſt thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale thoſe myſteries which were
ſtored vp in thy armoury, that is, in thy mind? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wert thou at any time idle? it is ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge that I wil tel
you, yet very certainly true, there neuer came in
my preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce idle word out of his mouth: all things
did ſtrea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſo exquiſit, levelled, weighed, &amp;
premeditated. What ſhould I ſpeake of his publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
diſcourſes? his excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s firſt preached
by him at <hi>Heidelberg</hi> were in admiration with all
men; the variety &amp; multiplicity of learning, which
he vſed in his lectures did refine, adorne, better &amp;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:317:165"/>
make fruitfull the wits of many, vvhich now in all
parts of the Chriſtian vvorld plant, ſovv, &amp; water
the garden and fielde of God, which build vp the
houſe of the liuing God, and laſtlie which by their
labours of imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do repreſent this their faithfull
maiſter, as it vvere reviued by them &amp; recalled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
death. Nay his ordinary table which he vſed in the
houſe of wiſdome, vvas ſo ſpread vvith varietie of
flowers &amp; ſweet fruits of that more ſacred ſort of
philoſophie, ſo ſtored with proviſion new &amp; old,
that it might wel ſeeme, not a table of vulgar phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie,
but a ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuarie of celeſtial wiſdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e. There
the voice of ſcripture reſounded, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meſſenger and interpreter of vviſdome, there
vvere her foſter-children, honeſty and modeſtie,
and (to vſe the words of <hi>Euſtathius</hi> in <hi>Macrobius</hi>)
with ſobriety, godlines. There was variety of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie,
natural and morall; there ſate by all the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and one after an other interpoſing did by
entercourſe breath louely &amp; liuely freſhnes into
the whole aſſembly. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil reckon theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his diſcourſes, he may for me; but I knovve
theſe were ful &amp; iuſt lectures, adorned with notes
of al ſciences, &amp; beautified with admirable graces.
And theſe ar the great vertues of his diſcourſes. But
who wil not marvel that al theſe vertues ſhoulde
dailie be poliſhed &amp; adorned by wrighting, that
moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; ready maker &amp; maſter of eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
diſcourſe? For this mirror of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tooke pleaſure to
feed the fluencie not only of his to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, but alſo of
his wit by wrighting: which is a thing that <hi>Tullie</hi>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to as many as deſire to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:317:165"/>
in ſpeaki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; teaching. Therfore al his lectures,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taties, obſervatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; notes were wrighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo
that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his own writings he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall helpes,
both for his owne memory, &amp; alſo for others dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
But amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt all theſe writings I maruell at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he could ſteale ſo much vaca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
time fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as to anſwere to many &amp; thoſe verie
weighty queſtions. He opened the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
of things, &amp; freely gaue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile to ſuch as reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
his adviſe, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was he moſt dutiful, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he
was ſuppoſed to think of nothing leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dutie.
This the learned &amp; vnlearned, the poore &amp; rich,
neighbors &amp; ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, friends &amp; enemies ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verie
wel witnes: none of al which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iuſtly complaine,
that he was either not regarded of him, or not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
by him. He endevored ſo curteouſly, ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie
&amp; faithfully to doe good to all, that he might win
al, &amp; ioine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his L. <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But ſome ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil ſay
theſe are priuate matters: where are thoſe publike
proofes of his piety &amp; charity? theſe thinges are ſo
ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly witneſſed &amp; proued, that they are indeede
cleerer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cleere ſun-ſhine at noone-day. For
thoſe elega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wrightings heretofore we haue ſeene
at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> came moſt out of this ſtore houſe: &amp;
thoſe which here, I ſay here 5. yeares ſince vvere
ſpred amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt vs, were al wrighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſame ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d;
and that hand which here hee guided by his skill,
God hath now poſſeſſed there with vndoubted
reſt. Tell mee (thou vpſtarte <hi>Eutyches</hi>) what didſt
thou ever feele more heavy then this hand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the hand of God, which doth vex, perſecute,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:317:166"/>
excruciate, torment, &amp; purſue them? What <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphon</hi>
did more ſtrongly beate downe thy <hi>Chimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra?</hi>
what <hi>Hercules</hi> thy <hi>Hydra?</hi> Who did ever more
couragiouſlie confound that thy <hi>Cerberian</hi> mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of <hi>Vbiquitie?</hi> But that I may not long dwell
on a matter vulgar and trivial, thou <hi>Sarmatian A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
ſhalt not eſcape the hand of this heroike cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
though iſſuing from vs. This ſame is he that
hath provided, filed, poliſhed, ſharpned and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto vs armour, prepared for the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
thy impious opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: of whoſe force I haue thought
good to fore-warne thee, that thou maieſt now at
length begin to looke backe to God &amp; revere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
feare the eternal ſon of the eternal God which is,
was, and ſhal be one together with the father for
ever and ever: which if thou wilt not doe, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
then that there is denounced from this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
eviction of thy blaſphemie, and from God, thy
downefall, ruine, and deſtruction. What truſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
vvhat diligence ſhall we thinke was in this ſweet
and ſacred ſoule, who ſuffred no hower, no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the day to paſſe without ſome profit? The
proofes of pietie &amp; charitie conſiſt eſpeciallie in
theſe 2. cauſes; firſt in maintaining true doctrine,
ſecondlie in aſſailing and ſuppreſſing that which
is falſe. Who the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is there that can addict himſelfe
more religiouſlie, learnedlie, fitlie, preſſelie, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentlie,
faithfullie, diligentlie &amp; ſtoutlie to true
and ſound doctrine then he hath done? To ſpeak
ſomwhat of his curteſie, what greater favor could
he do, then that whereof before I ſpake, vvhich
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:317:166"/>
was his diligence in vnfolding queſtions, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
adviſe? Which in this man was ever ſo elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
that he cleered all doubts moſt evidently,
diſcouered all ſophiſmes moſt ſubtilly, readilie, &amp;
with paſſing dexterity and agility, not with the
words of humane wiſedome, but by the power of
the holy ſpirit. Why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould any heere obiect,
that he was a man of churliſh and ſurly diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
In deed as they which are paineful in their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are ſomewhat ſurly to ſuch idle and ſlouthful
children as delight more in childiſh ſportes then
manly ſtudies: ſo they that are moſt diligent are
ſomewhat way warde to men of vanity. For to
my ſelfe and other good men that knew him, no
man was more curteous and affable. And if at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time he made it a religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſtir from any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which he buſily intended, I likewiſe made it
as great a religion to cal him away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: becauſe
I would preſuppoſe, that either he was very buſie
or not very wel. In my occaſions of buſines (ſaith
<hi>Tullie</hi>) I am very doubtful, when having begunne
any thing I am called to ſome other matter: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can I ſo eaſilie conioine things interrupted,
as finiſh them once purpoſed. Touching health
there is none ſo fooliſh but (if he doe not beleeue
me) may learne as much by nature &amp; experience.
Wherefore he is but a drone, that will be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to a buſie bee; and he too vnciuil, fooliſh, &amp;
importune, vvhich takes ſuch harmeful diligence
for a duty. Of this ſort there are many ſo fooliſh,
and iniurious to good men, that they ſcarce acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:317:167"/>
them men, vnleſſe they will every waie be as foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
as themſelues. What ſhall I here ſhew that, I
often ſee verie greate men complaine of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that they are ſodainlie called awaie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe
ſtudies that are ſacred, weightie, and required of
their place, and compelled againſt their willes to
ſpend moſt of their time in trifles, &amp; idle diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and ſo almoſt to nothing, to their owne great
greife, and the publique damage of the church.
How often, and how grieuouſly doe <hi>Nazianzen,
Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> confeſſe that they haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
theſe withdrawings and callings awaie from their
ſtudies? They truely deale more wiſely, ſo they
be not over ſtricte, which imitate that ſame <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
the Greate,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> For they ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betooke themſelues to their function, that they
preuented all ſuch withdrawings, as are wont, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
raſhly or without reſpect of dutie to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
vpon learned men. They ſaw well that if you
admit theſe importune ſaluters at the firſt, they
will afterward challenge it as a right to be troble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to good men, &amp; by their example provoke
other men to the ſame importunitie: but that you
ſhoulde provide for beſt, if at the firſt you tooke
ſome care, &amp; prevented theſe vncourteous curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
In this ſort therfore did this good ſoule do ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
to God, and the church, or elſe tender his
owne health. Thou rather art churliſh (ô thou im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whoſoeuer thou art!) which vncurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
deſireſt that, which <hi>Vrſinus</hi> of curteſie might
&amp; of duty ought to deny. It is folly not to excuſe
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:317:167"/>
him that is buſied in affaires of the church; but
not pardon him that tendereth the health of his
owne bodie is in humanitie: &amp; both contrarie to
the lawe of charity. Although (to come to the laſt
part of my ſpeech) this our deere brother was not
ſo hindered, but that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was vnable to lift his
handes, his tongue ſtambering, &amp; his iawes almoſt
cloſed vp, almoſt panting &amp; gaſpinge for breath
did yet attend to theſe ſtudies &amp; duties. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his ſtrength failed, &amp; the iuice &amp; bold in his body
was decaied, how often did hee thinke of this our
Schoole? How often did he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine that he was
idle amidſt that painfull buiſineſſe of his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
&amp; ſickneſſe? How reaſonablie did he perſiſt in
thoſe wrightings he had vndertaken, vntill that
ſoule which coulde bee conquered &amp; tamed by
no afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fleete &amp; flie out of his broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered, &amp; tamed corps? ô bleſſed is that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and wiſe ſeruant, whom his Lord when hee
commeth ſhal finde ſo doing? happie is that man,
whoſe God is the Lord?</p>
            <p>And that this man of famous memorie, our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
freind, is now in that hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the liuing God, in the heauenlie <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>
amongſt myriads of <hi>Angels,</hi> in the companie
&amp; church of thoſe firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into a heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly armie, with the iudge of al fleſh,
with God &amp; the ſpirit of the iuſt that are now
perfited, with the mediator of the New teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp; the ſprinkling of the bloud of our
ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both thoſe argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which before I vſed,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:317:168"/>
namely thoſe heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly gifts of wir, faith, hope, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of pietie, charitie, humanitie, and all other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and curteſies do evidently confirme, as alſo
that moſt happy ende which hee made doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
demonſtrate. For, not to ſpeake of this, that
his ſoule long ſince lived vnto God, &amp; was dead
vnto this wretched and miſerable world, (for ſo I
ſpeake holilie with Chriſtes Apoſtle of an holy
thing) when mention was made vnto him of faith,
hope, charity, reſurrection, life, glory, and eternall
happineſſe, Lord how did he aſſent, applaude, &amp;
ſweetelie ſmile at it! how did he caſt vp his eies to
our Redeemer! to whom as he had long before co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
himſelfe, ſo alſo he did at length ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his ſoule moſt peaceably, &amp; ſo was wafted out
of the deepe ſea of this world, into a moſt pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
harbour of ſalvation and reſt, euen the boſome &amp;
embracings of our heauenlie father. Who is there
heere (I beſeech you) amongſt vs, that wil not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſlie
crie out for ioy, and wiſh together with
me! <hi>O let my ſoule die the death of the iuſt, and let my
ende be like vnto his.</hi> For he truely ſaw, he ſaw by
liuelie faith heauen open vnto him, &amp; Chriſt the
Prince and perfiter of our faith ſitting at the right
hand of maieſtie in the heauens, incomparable
glory provided for him, the whole companie of
that heauenly church welcomming him, laſtly all
making to ſaluation, ſince he did ſo quietly yeeld
vp his ſoule vuto God the Creator and Father of
ſpirits, that ſo hee might liue with him eternallie.
This then is that ſoule (noble and worthy audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors)
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:317:168"/>
this is that ſanctified ſoule and acceptable to
God, which to our great loſſe is of late daies take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
from vs: although (as ſometimes <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>
ſaide) wee haue not loſt it, but ſent it before,
purpoſing our ſelues in good time to follow. We
haue not loſt but repaied him, as <hi>Epictetus</hi> warneth
vs. For he which gaue him hath required &amp; recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him backe againe. Why then do we mourne
for him whom we haue not loſt? We lament that
ſo ſweet and fit an inſtrument of Gods glorie is
receiued backe from vs: we lament this foreſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of euil hanging ouer vs, and now ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
vs: we lament the preſent ouer-flowing of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
iniuſtice, and al perfidious dealing, which
commonly preuaileth ſo much the more, as it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
theſe meanes of protection and ſaluation
to be taken from vs. For haue we not reaſon to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the loſſe of that inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, of whom it is ſin
to conceale any thing that may worthily be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in commendation? I know right well (noble
auditors) that many here preſent are able to ſpeak
more to this purpoſe then I either haue done or
can do. For that dailie familiarity which you had
with our <hi>Vrſine,</hi> hath enriched you with ſtore of
matter, and variety of learning with eloquence.
But ſeeing of duty &amp; deſerte I haue yeelded you
the firſt place in this matter, and you haue vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
me the ſecond; you wil alſo (I hope) willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pardon me, for ſubſtituting in my roome a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
to ſpeake of a Diuine, and attribute vnto this
man that which himſelfe ſpake ſometimes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:317:169"/>
the ſtoute mainetainer of the truth, and
Antagoniſt of errors. <hi>He was the Lords faithful labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
a man of God, the reconciler of men, the trompet of
truth, the pillar of the church, Gods true champion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in the faith of Chriſt, moſt fit for defence againſt
poiſenous hereſies: who though he were peaceable &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
in all things, yet could hee neuer patiently endure,
that for quietneſſe ſake God ſhould be betraied but was a
vehement warrier and an invincible Herioicke spirit in
this caſe: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending ſome, moderately chaſtiſing others;
correcting ſome mens coldneſſe, bridling others heate:
providing for ſome that they fall not, labouring that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which were fallen might be raiſed againe; ſimple of
maners, divers in diſcharge of many duties; wiſe of talke,
wiſer in vnderſtanding; wherefore he ſo liued, was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
and ſo inſtructed others, that as his life &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
might be a liſt &amp; limit to vpright diſchardge of the
like dutie: ſo alſo his opinions may bee examples as it
were authenticke lawes of faith and religion.</hi> All this I
may wel ſpeake in commendation of this our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
which the ſame Divine ſpake ſometimes in
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> And would God haue
taken from vs and the church ſuch an inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
except he had bin angry for our ſins? did not God
condemne the wickednes of the world, when hee
tooke <hi>Enoch</hi> vnto himſelfe? vvas not all <hi>Iſrael</hi> on
fire after <hi>Eliſaeus</hi> was dead? was not <hi>Iuda</hi> miſerably
perſecuted &amp; put to the worſt after the death of
<hi>Ioſias?</hi> haue not we read that <hi>Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Stilico</hi> ſaid deſtru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction
attended on <hi>Italie</hi> when ſo worthy a man as
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> was dead? was not <hi>Africke, Germanie,</hi> and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:317:169"/>
la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſorely vexed, after they had loſt <hi>Auſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Luther,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Bucer?</hi> And I am of opinion that God doth but
reveale vnto vs ſome great &amp; preſent anger of his,
and fore-ſhew ſome ſeuere iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt this
vngratefull generation, by the death of other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
men, &amp; of this choice inſtrument by name.
But what if God not by worde onely but alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
haue ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtirred vp our vnrepe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tant harts to
a profitable meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; terrour of theſe thinges?
Wee truely haue read, ſeene, &amp; obſerued howe
great and manifold ſignes and tokens God vſeth
to ſhew both in heauen and earth, before hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
away thoſe ſacred lights from amongſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
How vehementlie he doth as it were clothe
heauen and earth with mourning and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
how fearfully he threatneth to ſet all on fire.
All which he doth to no other end but by many
teſtimonies of his anger to call vs to repentance,
and may giue vs to vnderſtand that hee choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
rather to diſburden his anger vpon al things
then to ſtrike mankinde: and in the end when
hee is ſo neere, that for often offending his
patience hee is readie to directe the arrowes
of his anger againſt our verie heades; that
then hee may ſhewe that thoſe good men in
whome hee taketh moſt delight, are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from danger of this generall fire and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
diluge of diſtruction. Wherefore (noble
audience) this is the thinge for which wee
mourne and ſorrow, this is that wherwith we
are moued and ſo neerelye touched: and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:317:170"/>
and truely we ſhew our ſelues iron &amp; flintie har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
if we ſhould nor be broken with theſe heauy
and feuere tokens and fore-runners of Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,
and ſubmitte our ſelues by obedience
vnder the hand of the almightie. I ſee alſo an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinge to be much bewailed and lamented.
But what is that? Whie this, that if iudgment doe
not immediatly enſue on theſe threats, the world
growes inſolent vpon the death of ſuch men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaideth
the truth by open and ſecret practizes,
raizeth vp hereſies, hardeneth it ſelfe in all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
and encourageth it ſelfe to ſee thoſe men
take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> awaie whith are aduerſaries to his opinions,
and ſpoileth and waſteth the church, beinge laſt
deſtitute of her vigilant and faithfull paſtors, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
and guardians. Theſe fearfull dangers, theſe
ſore diſcommodities, theſe ſhamfull miſcheiues,
do beare, racke, and kill, the hearts of all good
men: the feare of theſe thinges (that I may ſay
ſomewhat concerning my ſelfe) doth not ſo much
enforce me to bewaile the loſſe of this my ſweete
deere and meere fellow-profeſſor, that powerfull
teacher and bleſſed ſoule, as the leauinge of vs all
deſtitut of ſuch a one, &amp; the preſaging of of thoſe
evils, which I beſeech God of his mercy to turne
awaie from vs.</p>
            <p>And thus (worthie and learned auditors) you
haue ſeene ſhadowed by my pencil the life of our
deere VRSINE, whoſe memorie ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for ever. I know we muſt not long either la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
him, or pittie his memorie. Yf by my words
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:317:170"/>
I haue againe renued anie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s heauineſſe, let him
togeather with me call to minde how much good
we reaped by him in his life time. What good ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
we receaued of him, we did not therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
it that we ſhould envie his good. Let vs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
everie of vs looke to this, that as he was good
to all, ſo we alſo may in ſuch ſorte follow ſpiritual
good things, that by them we alſo may become
good. He gaue himſelfe painfully to good ſtudies,
let vs alſo do the like. He frankelie dealte vnto
all men that rich treaſure, which he had by his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
ſtored, and God by his heauenlie grace had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed;
let vs alſo followinge his example beſtowe
vſe &amp; fruitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe good gifts which by Gods
grace are grounded in us, on our fellow-ſeruants:
let vs further pietie, charitie, courteſie, quietnes,
and the common good; and let vs in the ſight of
God, and in this ſchoole, as in a moſt choiſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater
bring vp ſtudious youth both for life and
learninge to the ſame ende, and ſtrengthen both
our ſelues and others in the faith of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And
thou beloued youth, thou ſvveete aſſemblie,
which couldeſt haue wiſhed that thine inſtructor
to haue liued longer for thine ovvne ſake, for our
ſake, for this ſchoole, for the church, &amp; the whole
world; bemoane no longer his abſence, vvhome
thou reioyceſt to haue hade preſent with thee
ſometimes by example of life, &amp; whome yet thou
makeſt vſe of in thoſe his ever-memorable wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
Endeuour rather to ſtirre vp more <hi>Vrſines</hi>
about thee. He hath one heir of his bodie, vvho,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:317:171"/>
wee hope will alſo bee heir of his vertues. But the
way is open to you all to bee partakers of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.
Goe to, now you are well growen, enter
then, &amp; ſet foote in poſſeſſion of this inheritance.
You want neither wit, nor helpes of ſtudie, not
yet the waie; one thinge onely remaineth, that
yee wante not will, and bee not wanting to your
ſelues. Applie then diligently your will and your
ſelues to theſe ſtudies; applie your ſelues verie
faithfully &amp; painfully to all duties of pietie, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and humanitie; toile and laboure herein, &amp; be
vnto vs another VRSINE euery man in his
place. And though every one of you cannot bring
to the building of this tabernacle the golde, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and iewels of VRSINE, yet deſpaire not
preſently; iron, braſſe, woode, Goates haire,
and ſtones are alſo acceptable vnto God. You
that cannot bee Captaines, or in the firſt rancke;
bee not therefore diſcouraged: there is alſo need
of ſome to bee in the ſecond, third, fourth, tenth,
and twentieth rancke: and Chriſt witneſſeth,
that even ſuch alſo haue an order and place in his
Fathers houſe. It ſhall be no diſgrace to bee euen
a doore-keeper in the houſe of the liuinge God.
For of this euen <hi>David,</hi> (a man after Gods owne
hearte) was not aſhamed; neither be you nowe
aſhamed, neither ſhall it euer repent you, to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
into theſe liſtes, to enter into theſe ſtudies,
to attend theſe duties, or to follow theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
They ſhall (ſaith <hi>Fabius</hi>) carrie themſelues
farre higher, which endevour to come to the top,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:317:171"/>
then ſuch as before deſpairing of comming ſo
high as they would, do ſtraight ſet vp their reſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the bottome. But what of that? neither I
my ſelfe which now ſpeake to you am any thing
neere this noble patterne, (I ſpeake only of my
ſelfe, as for the giftes of my fellow profeſſors, I
admire, and in duty reverence them) neither
can you attaine therevnto by your owne indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.
But alaſſe that VRSINE, that <hi>man of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of God</hi> (for ſo his name doth ſignifie
in <hi>Hebrew</hi>) is taken from vs: now there remaineth
to vs only the remembrance of ſo excellent a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
What then ſhal we do? That <hi>Iah,</hi> that ſtrong God,
who remembring his ſervant <hi>Zacharie,</hi> advanced
him to ſo high a top of faith godlineſſe, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<hi>Chriſt</hi> that prophet and our only king, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
preſent with vs, both by his external maieſtie,
&amp; alſo by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating vnto vs the holy Ghoſt.
Let vs repaire to this teacher, adviſe with this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and follow this guide: let vs in confidence of
his grace and aſſiſtance conſtantly goe through
with thoſe ſtudies and duties wherevnto wee are

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lled. Let not the impiety of heretiques boaſt
it ſelfe, nor the adverſaries heart ſwell and waxe
inſolent or prowde, becauſe the rodde of him
that chaſtiſed them is broken: for there ſhall ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
come a viper out of the roote of the ſerpent,
&amp; the fruit therof ſhal ſoner become a flying dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
(as <hi>Eſaie</hi> in times paſt did prophecie) then we
ſhall bee forſaken of our God, &amp; expoſed to the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:317:172"/>
raging violence of the furious, or fooliſh dreames
of the mad ſorte of men, vvherewith (alaſſe?) the
church often times is to much afflicted.</p>

bright-ſhininge light, which thou haſt placed in

Wee beſeech thee (ô GOD and father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies)
not to ſuffer thy wrath to proceede any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againſt this poore floocke, neither call vs &amp;
our ſinnes to accoumpt, leaſt thy wrath kindle

But rather (becauſe here thou haſt placed thy

that they ſhal be bleſſed which retire themſelues
vnto thee; gouerne vs (ô Lorde) by thy ſpirite,
that we may kiſſe thy beloued ſonne, and looke
