         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO MY
Honoured Friend
Sir Edmund Warcupp,
of Oxfordshire, K<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I shall make you but a bad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
for Lending me these <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,</hi>
by sending them back in
my <hi>English.</hi> However I did not
think I could be too intent upon
them, when the longer I read, and
considered this <hi>Book,</hi> the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of two <hi>such Brothers</hi> as the
Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schal
<hi>Turenne;</hi> raised in me a True
and more Lively Idea of your
<hi>Sons,</hi> the <hi>Colonel,</hi> and the <hi>Captain.</hi>
It is true, that the <hi>former</hi> being
<pb facs="tcp:50645:3"/>
born <hi>Princes,</hi> became Great <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi>
but then they lived long in
the World to obtain it: whereas
the other <hi>Two Brothers,</hi> though
cut off in their Bloom, had done
more than any of such an Age could
do, towards Equalling <hi>their</hi> Great
Examples.</p>
            <p>The Battle of <hi>Sedan,</hi> in which
the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> got his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Glory, has nothing more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
in it than the Action, by
which he gained the Enemies Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:
and, upon Reading this, who
could not but have an Image of
Colonel <hi>Warcupp</hi>'s Bravery in the
Battle of <hi>Steynkirk,</hi> where he drove
the <hi>French</hi> from their Cannon, and
laid his own Half-Pike upon them.
In the same Battle when the Count
<hi>de Soissons</hi> should have received the
Advantage of the Victory, It is
with Surprize that we find him
dead. This naturally brings Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain
<pb facs="tcp:50645:3"/>
               <hi>Warcupp</hi> to our Remembrance,
who, when <hi>He</hi> should have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the New Commands, which,
for his Valour, the <hi>King</hi> designed
Him, was (instead of enjoying the
Reward) found mortally wounded
in <hi>His Majesty</hi>'s Service.</p>
            <p>This, to a common Reader, may
seem a melancholy and an improper
Address to a <hi>Father,</hi> but then they
must be Ignorant of the Greatness
of Sir <hi>Edmund Warcupp</hi>'s Mind, and
his true Notions of Honour. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemon</hi>
heretofore gloried in so
great a Man as <hi>Thrasibulus,</hi> who,
receiving his Son <hi>Pitanas</hi> dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Shield in his Countrey's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
Interred him with these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions:
<hi>Let other Fathers shed
Tears; I'll not: This Youth died, like
mine: Like a</hi> Spartan.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> has Reason to boast of a
Double Honour in Sir <hi>Edmund War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupp,</hi>
who with such an Evenness
<pb facs="tcp:50645:4"/>
of Temper, and Heroick Patience,
could bear the Loss of <hi>Two Sons,</hi> so
Young, so Brave, so very much his
own, and so true <hi>English Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for my own part, were I to
be a Father, I should wish for such
Sons; and must they die! I would
lose them after the same manner.
And, I am sure, that in bearing of
my Misfortune, I could have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pattern than your self. But,
in the Circumstances I am in, at
present, there is nothing I am more
Ambitious of, than to be Admitted
amongst the Number of,</p>

            <head>MEMOIRS
OF THE
LIFE
OF
FREDERICK MAURICE
De la Tour d' Auvergne,
DUKE de BOUILLON.</head>
            <p>THere is no need of any Motive but Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
alone to make the generality of
Men commit to Writing such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Passages as come to their
Knowledge: For their aim is not only at present
Glory, but the recommending of their Memory
to future Ages. But as for my Self, I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
that these are not the Motives that induce
me to the undertaking of these Memoirs. And
that which makes me believe, that I give a sound
judgment of my self, upon this occasion, is, that
I had never began 'em, if I had not put an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50645:6"/>
violence upon my own Nature, and look'd
upon the finishing of 'em as a duty indispensable.
Let a Man take all the caution he can, there will
happen out a thousand inconveniencies from such
sort of undertakings. One of the wisest Men of
our Age, and of the first Quality in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
endanger'd his Family by the unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a Transcriber, and the malice of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that had corrupted him. Besides, let a Man
have whatever design he please of writing only
for himself, and letting nothing appear in publick
till after his Decease, yet I see plainly, that ones
Opinion often alters; and that either under the
pretence of placing a great confidence in some
Persons, or taking their advice, one willingly
searches after Confidents, to the end that one
may find Admirers; so that among the great
number of Friends, whom our own self-Love or
presumption makes choice of in these Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
one always finds some indiscreet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
Person or other, who reveals such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
truths as will never admit of Pardon:
and it is impossible, without speaking of several
Persons, to write the Memoirs of a Man's Life who
bore the principal part in so many great Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions.
Besides, to speak conformably to my
own inclinations, I should chuse any other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
rather than this, to fill up that idle
time which my misfortunes for some years last
past have thrown upon my hands. But the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> is so dear to me,
and I have so great a veneration for it, that I
daily reproach my self for having so long defer'd
the publishing of what I know concerning so
great a Person.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50645:6"/>
I have endeavoured, but without Effect, to
learn something of his Infancy; for I should
have been willing to have spoken of it; being
perswaded, by several Observations I have
made, That generally even in that tender Age of
Mankind, there are some lights given towards the
discovery of what may afterwards be expected
from them. And when-ever those to whom
the care of their Education is committed, are
deficient in the Knowledge of their Capacity,
the Qualifications of their Mind, their Genius;
and, in short, their peculiar Inclinations, and
their Nature in general; it must be either for
want of Light or Application. Nor do I doubt
but that we are often led, either to good or
evil, and indeed to any sort of business, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the first Impressions and Examples that
are given us. Upon this very account, I cannot
sufficiently wonder at the little Care that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the Education of Children. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we regard Religion, as becomes every true
Christian, or consult humane Prudence only;
I think there is nothing in the World, that is
of equal Consequence. I know some Tempers
appear so manifest, and their Inclination to evil
is so violent, that it is almost impossible to alter
them; but there are very few, that by great
Care and due Management may not be retrieved,
if we begin to set about it betimes. You see how
<hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> were for some time able
to prevail over the cruel Inclinations of <hi>Nero.</hi>
They might, perhaps, have made an honest
Man of him, if, as a private Person, he had
been subject to the Laws, and oblig'd to raise a
Fortune by his Virtuous Actions: But the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50645:7"/>
of his Birth, placing him above any thing
that he might be afraid of, and beyond any
thing he could farther desire, he followed the
whole Current of his wicked Inclinations. But,
I perceive, That my Discourse has already ran
too far upon a Subject, which has no very great
Relation to the Matter which I propose to
Treat of.</p>

               <head>THE
First BOOK.</head>
               <p>Frederick Maurice de la Tour d' Auvergne,
was Son of Henry de la Tour d' Auvergne,
Duke of Bouillon, Sovereign of Sedan, by
Isabella of Nassau.</p>
               <p>IT would be unnecessary for me to speak of
the House of the Duke of <hi>Bouillon:</hi> All
<hi>France</hi> knows, That both for its Antiquity,
and the Grandeur of its Original, it is one of
the most Illustrious among the Chief Families
in the Kingdom: And Strangers are well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
inform'd of it by their frequent Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with the Principal Families of <hi>Europe,</hi> and
by the Sovereignties of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Sedan,</hi> which
fell into it in the last Age.</p>
               <p>I shall say but very little likewise of the Duke
<hi>de Bouillon,</hi> during his Minority, because I have
not so exact Memoirs, as I could have desired,
and I will advance nothing, which I have not
seen, or am very well assured of.</p>
               <p>He compleated his Studies at <hi>Sedan,</hi> where
Mr. <hi>du Moulin,</hi> the <hi>Minister,</hi> was his Tutour;
a Man very much esteem'd for his Learning. He
bred him up in the Reformed Religion, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50645:8"/>
                  <hi>Duke,</hi> his <hi>Father,</hi> and his <hi>Mother,</hi> being both
Protestants. His first Journey from thence, was
into <hi>Holland,</hi> when he was about sixteen Years
old. This Countrey was then the Seat of War,
and in the Opinion of all the World, the best
School to learn that Art in.</p>
               <p>His Uncle, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who was
esteemed one of the greatest Generals of his
Time, made him begin with a Colours in the
Regiment of <hi>Maison-Neuve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have heard say, That, at first, there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
little extraordinary in him, and that indeed
he was something slow in displaying himself. He
spoke little, kept himself reserv'd, and among
his own Domesticks. But at last he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
sufficiently known, and gain'd a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
as soon as he began to have some Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
in the Affairs of War, and the
Countrey. This show'd, That his Silence, and
Inclination to so peculiar a Reservedness, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
only from his extraordinary Natural Parts,
which would not suffer him to speak of things
without understanding them.</p>
               <p>He then became Curious to that degree, that
he was inquisitive about ev'ry thing, and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the Niceties of the smallest Matters,
that he might know 'em throughly. But in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
his Curiosity, he never apply'd himself,
but to such Persons with whom he was most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar.
He then permitted himself to make a
small sally towards the Pleasures of Youth; and,
amongst the rest, that of frequent Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in which, though He was always mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent,
yet it was without Excess.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50645:8"/>
In a short time he became active and vigilant,
and familiar even to Popularity, when it suited
with his Designs: a Talent, which I have seen
him make an admirable Use of, in the following
Course of his Life, upon very important Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> seeing him thus alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and finding, that he had a strong Propensity
to War; began to take a little more Care, in
informing him. He commanded him out, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Occasions, where any thing might be
learn'd, or any Honour gain'd. The Duke <hi>de
Bouillon</hi> answered his Designs and Hopes with
that Advantage; that I have heard him then
commend him to divers Persons, for having
signaliz'd his Courage and Conduct in several
Encounters.</p>
               <p>One of the most Considerable was at <hi>Boisleduc.</hi>
The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> having besieg'd it, the
long Resistance, which the Garrison made, had
so weakned and dispirited his Army, that, not
thinking himself able to hinder a Convoy,
which the Enemy were sending, from entring
the Town; there was a Resolution taken secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Council to raise the Siege. The Duke
of <hi>Bouillon</hi> having Notice of it, earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested,
That he might be permitted to go and
encounter this Convoy. He laid before the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> the Methods, by which he
would be guided in this Design. The Prince
finding they had been extreamly well contriv'd,
propos'd 'em to the Council, where it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd,
That the Event of 'em should be try'd.
In Pursuance of this, the Duke took such Troops
as he had demanded; He led them, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50645:9"/>
March, to find the Enemy in a
place where he had projected before to fight 'em,
because it was very advantagious to himself.
There he attack'd 'em, defeated 'em, took their
Commander Prisoner, and brought the Convoy,
which was design'd for the Relief of the Place,
into the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Camp.</p>
               <p>This Action rais'd the Duke to a great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and began to make him look'd upon as
an Extraordinary Man. He gain'd the Hearts of
the Soldiery, by the Opinion they conceived of
his Courage, and his great Genius for Warlike
Affairs; but more especially by that Natural
Goodness which appear'd in all his Actions, by
his Modesty, in speaking of himself, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity,
when he did not command them. He
had a good Mien, but could not be said to be
handsome. He was proper, had a high Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
his Eyes full and sparkling; Eye-brows
large and thick, but at a convenient distance.
There was nothing rough either in his Mind or
Humour; yet something great and fierce both
in his Air and Tread. He knew even the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
Officers, and, that they might not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of it, he affected to call 'em by their
Names: a way of treating Inferiours, very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
and becoming a great Lord.</p>
               <p>The States General, and those of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
could not long continue silent in his Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which we may look upon as the more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
because they grounded them upon their
own glory and advantage; for this incident
caus'd <hi>Boisleduc</hi> to be Surrendred, which was a
place very important to them, and added much
to the reputation of their Arms. They began
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50645:9"/>
to reward the Services of the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>
with the Government of <hi>Mastricht,</hi> which they
gave him. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> show'd great
satisfaction in all these Proceedings, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he wou'd not have beheld 'em without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness
and jealousy, if they had not rais'd
thoughts in him suitable to his own Interests.
He was now very old, and had but one Son, and
he in the Cradle, so that not hoping to be able
to live long enough to see him of a sufficient Age
to fill his Place, and finding all People well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> he look'd upon
him as a Man in whose hands he might deposite
the Government of the States upon his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease;
and to link him still more closely to him
than he was already by his Relation, as a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
he resolv'd to make him his Son-in-Law,
but he thought it Prudence to wait another op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to declare this to him.</p>
               <p>Things stood in this condition, when in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nival
time, the Troops being in Winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> would go <hi>incognito</hi> to
see <hi>Brussells.</hi> This Journey which he undertook
at first as a thing indifferent, only for diversion,
and to satisfy his Curiosity, did afterwards change
the whole Scheme of his Fortune, and by a train
of accidents became the source of all the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and misfortunes of his Life. So that it is
every day apparent, that the Fate of the greatest
Men and most flourishing States, turns upon things
which at first view seem of no consequence, and
we often find, that if that which we ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
had happen'd, we should be miserable;
whereas all our happiness often proceeds from
this, That the things we are afraid of come to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50645:10"/>
pass in spight of us. Notwithstanding all this,
we never leave projecting, and attributing the
good success to our selves, though we are often
ignorant of the Causes, and can never foresee the
effects. If to such evident demonstrations of our
Vanity, and the weakness of our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
we do but add those thoughts which we
ought to have as good Christians, we should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
show more Courage when we ly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unhappy Circumstances, because we should
see the hand of God in them: and we should have
less uneasiness while our designs are depending,
because we should never frame any but with
an entire submission to the Disposal of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>One of the most splendid Courts in <hi>Europe,</hi>
was at <hi>Brussels,</hi> when the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> came
thither. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had retreated
thither, and had been follow'd by some Persons
of the first Quality in the Kingdom, and a
great Number of the Nobility. The <hi>Infanta
Isabella</hi> likewise had drawn thither the Principal
Families of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> of which she was
Governess. Here it was, That the Duke of
<hi>Bouillon</hi> saw <hi>Madamoiselle de Bergh,</hi> at a Ball.
She was a Person of great Birth, of a surprizing
Beauty, had the Reputation of much Wit and
Prudence, but a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and without any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> having learn'd her
Name, found that she was his Relation; but
there was a Motive, stronger than that of Blood,
which made him ambitious of being known to
her before his Departure. The Visits which he
made her, engag'd him still farther. However
he departed, without speaking of the Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50645:10"/>
she had made upon his Soul, though she easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceiv'd it. The Report of this Passion,
was soon spread in <hi>Holland,</hi> by those who had
born him Company to <hi>Brussels:</hi> and because no
one could imagine that it would come to a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
for abundance of Reasons, which destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the very Thoughts of such a thing; People
spoke of it only as the Adventure of a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and that before his Face. But soon after
he return'd to <hi>Brussels,</hi> in very great danger,
and upon a slight Pretence. This second Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
made it apparent, That the Duke was
more in Love, than he was thought to be. At
his Arrival he found a Discourse of a Match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Madamoiselle de Bergh,</hi> and the Count <hi>de
Bossu.</hi> Honour and Jealousie join'd themselves
with Love, and forc'd the Duke to declare his
Designs of Marriage. He return'd by the way
of <hi>Sedan,</hi> to propose it to the Dutchess his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But she was the more averse to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she knew her Brother, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
had design'd him for one of his Daughters, who
was afterwards married to the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh:</hi>
Besides his Mother had always resolv'd
he should marry one of her own Religion, and
indeed he might have had his Choice of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Lady in <hi>France,</hi> nor had he been a Match
below any Foreigner.</p>
               <p>Upon his Return to <hi>Holland,</hi> the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> and his real Friends, us'd all their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to perswade him from this Marriage,
and he, having Spirit and Ambition enough, often
attack'd himself with very potent Arguments.
But these contributed only to his Uneasiness:
For when Absence and Difficulties cann't efface
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50645:11"/>
the first Impressions of Love, they render the
Passion so strong, That nothing can be able to
change it.</p>
               <p>When the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a Year in this Condition; his Mind in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence,
and his Soul divided, by the Opposition
which his Love made to his Fortune; he at last
fix'd his Resolution, and the Dutchess his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> having not been
able to hinder the Marriage, were forced to
approve it, when it was consummated. Love
has often made the greatest Men neglect the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which Fortune has offer'd them, and
that in a much riper Age than the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
was yet arriv'd to. I shall speak but one
Word in his Favour, and to the Honour of his
Dutchess, That I verily believe he never repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his having married her. The Duke having
tarried some time at <hi>Sedan,</hi> whither he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
carried his Lady, went with her into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and there Beauty and Merit gain'd so far
the Ascendant, That every one approv'd the
Choice, which they had before so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p>From the <hi>Hague</hi> the Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> went to
<hi>Mastricht,</hi> to give his Orders, as Governour,
and afterwards returned to <hi>Sedan,</hi> with a Design
to tarry there some time. His first business was,
to gain an exact Insight into his own Concerns,
which he effected with the greater Ease, because
never Man did things in better Order. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
even in the smallest Matters: It was not
in his Power to look over 'em superficially, as
Persons of Quality generally do, who think it
a Vertue, to place a blind Confidence in their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50645:11"/>
Servants, and never perceive their own Ruine,
till it is past Remedy: As for him, he saw and
examined all, yet without that Spirit of Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by some call'd good Husbandry, into which
Men often fall by too great Exactness: so near
to one another are Vertues and their opposite
Vices.</p>
               <p>But as for these lesser Affairs, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
laid aside, when more Important Business
requir'd his Attendance. He was very industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but the pains he took were never uneasie to
him. He never retreated at the Prospect of any
Labour, how great soever it might be, either
of Body or Mind; but indeed he was the same
in every thing; he would be so intent upon his
very Diversions, that one would think he had
been made to pursue them only. In private
Company he had so complaisant an Air, and
would relax his Mind so far, that it would then
be hard to perceive his more Noble Qualities:
and yet to have seen him upon some great and
publick Action, one would have thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for him to reduce himself to a private
Station, though this was easie to him when-ever
he thought it necessary.</p>
               <p>His Affairs at <hi>Sedan,</hi> were not so many as to
take up all his time, so he applied himself to
reading, and having fallen upon <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Works,
his Mother was extremely pleased with it,
being confident, That they would be a means
to confirm him in his Religion. But when she
faw, that from reading he pass'd to doubting,
and from Doubts to a Desire of having them
clear'd, she began to take the Alarm, especially
when she was told by <hi>du Moulin,</hi> That the Duke
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50645:12"/>
had propos'd to him the holding a Conference in
his Presence, with a certain Religious Person, who
was thought to be very well vers'd in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie:
then she beg'd of him to relinquish that
Design, and demonstrated to him both her Grief
and Fears.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had always had a great
Tenderness and Respect for his Mother, and his
Fear of disobliging her, was the greater and
more just, because he had so much displeas'd her
with his Marriage.</p>
               <p>These Considerations delay'd the Conference
for some time, though the Duke did ardently
desire it, because <hi>du Moulin</hi> had urg'd several
things against the Catholick Religion, which the
Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> was not able to answer. He
spent some Months in these Circumstances, but
being no longer able to lie under such Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
in an Affair of so great Consequence,
he Resolv'd, to be plain with <hi>du Moulin,</hi> and to
speak to him as his Prince. He told him then,
That he would propound his Doubts in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Father he had propos'd before, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
understanding Person, that he had sent for
to <hi>Sedan:</hi> but he charg'd him, Not to let his
Mother have any intimation of it. There were
several secret Conferences held, after which the
Duke was perfectly convinced of the Errours of
his Perswasion. He made his Abjuration of it,
but it was in private, that he might not offend
his Mother; hoping, by this Management, to
endeavour, in time, to bring her over to the
Knowledge of the Truth. He set himself to
this, with all the Application imaginable; and
we may imagine he would leave nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50645:12"/>
in so important an Affair, whose Success
would spare him so much Trouble.</p>
               <p>It would be too tedious for me to relate here,
what pass'd after this, during the space of two
Years, in which he continued to gain farther
Light and more ample Instructions. I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say this, That I believe, No Man of his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was ever better instructed, or more perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of his Religion.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, he receiv'd Advice, That the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> were marching to <hi>Mastricht,</hi> with a
Design to besiege it. He was to lose no time,
but immediately to throw himself into the
Town. He departed the same moment, but
found it invested. How-ever, by good Fortune,
he got in, though not without Danger. He defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it with a great deal of Bravery, and signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd
himself by frequent Sallies: so that the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> having gain'd time to join his
Troops; and to march; the Enemy, upon his
Approach, immediately rais'd the Siege.</p>
               <p>In this Place the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> met with
<hi>Beringuan,</hi> for whom he had a great Esteem
and Friendship. He was a Man of Worth: Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Richlieu</hi> had banish'd him, because he was
in favour with <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII<hi>th.</hi> and because He
had not only a great deal of Loyalty, but as
much Bravery and Conduct.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> made him the Confident
of his Abjuration; and withal, told him, That
to the present minute he had kept it as a great
Secret, because of the Dutchess his Mother;
but that, seeing (though not without extreme
Concern) neither Time, nor any thing else
that he could do, would retrieve her from her

Errours, he was upon the point of declaring

Religion, when he receiv'd the News,
That the Enemy was marching to <hi>Mastricht.</hi> He
added, That there was but one onely Reason,
which could possibly induce him to delay it
longer, which was his Suspicion, lest in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Conjuncture, the News of his Abjuration
might raise some Jealousies in the States and
Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> but that, as soon as he should
come to <hi>Sedan,</hi> he would declare, and send them
a Resignation of their Government, and the
Command he had in their Cavalry: which he
did the first moment after his Return.</p>
               <p>The great Affliction of his Mother, the
Dutchess, cannot be express'd. Nor was the
Grief and Indignation of the whole Family any
less. The City of <hi>Sedan,</hi> inhabited by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
chang'd the Love they bore him into a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Hatred. He lost all his Posts in <hi>Holland,</hi> and
renounc'd his greatest Expectations. In short,
upon the sole Respect he had to his future
Salvation, he resisted all humane Considerations,
and pass'd by all the Advantages of his Fortune.
So many great Difficulties, which he foresaw
well enough, and knew they must be surmounted,
might easily let us see the Vigour of his Mind,
and the Grandeur of his Courage; unless the
Conversion of Mens Hearts is to be attributed
to God alone.</p>
               <p>Some time after the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
his Abjuration, he came to Court. He
knew it not, nor was he known there, but by
his Reputation. His Design was to follow the
Interest of <hi>France,</hi> where he had large Demesnes,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50645:23"/>
and his chief Inclination being to War, that
against <hi>Spain,</hi> which had continued some Years,
seem'd to open a way both to his Glory, and his
Fortunes.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> was then at the highest
Pitch of his Grandeur. He was a great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
who, as all others do, ow'd the beginning
of his Fortune to a favourable Conjuncture, but
the Settlement and Consequences of it were the
Work of his own Wit and Conduct. He had
always great Designs: and never troubled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with any, but the most important Affairs
of State; that he might have more time for his
Diversions and Repose. He govern'd the State
with an Absolute Power, but yet without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
the King, who, on the contrary, hated
him at the bottom. But the good success of his
Administration, and the sure Establishments he
had made himself; set him beyond the Effects of
Hatred. However, there was always some Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,
who, not being sufficiently devoted to
him, still gave occasion to Cabals in the Court,
and the Intriegues of the Closet: and these, join'd
with the fresh Example of the Death of Marshall
<hi>d' Ancre,</hi> caus'd great Disquietness to him. He
spar'd nothing to gain Persons of Merit over to
him, or to ruine 'em, when he could not gain
them. And no Minister was ever better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of what pass'd both within and without
the Kingdom. Should one judge of him by his
Countenance, and outward Appearance, nothing
could be expected but an extraordinary Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Whereas he was violent in all his Desires;
and Love and Hatred never had a fuller power
over a great Man, to make him act as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50645:24"/>
Many of the most considerable Incidents of
his Life, had one or other of these two Passions for
their Foundation. He was very sensible of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
but never pardon'd a declared Enmity.
So his Ministry was terrible to Persons that were
not in his Interests. For as those he confided in
might aspire to any thing, so there was nothing
but what his Enemies had Reason to be afraid
of. All the great Lords that would not submit
to him were in Prison, banished, or out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
In short, either forc'd by the necessity of
the times, or his own Nature, he always chose
rather to establish the Security of his Person and
Fortune by Rigour and Blood, than to run the
hazard of good Nature and Clemency.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> made no long stay at
<hi>Paris.</hi> He was well receiv'd by the King, and
all the Court. The <hi>Count de Soissons</hi> visited him
often, and upon all occasions treated him with a
distinction, which shew'd his peculiar Esteem, and
a Desire of having him for his Friend. But they
parted without entring upon any matter that
was considerable. The Cardinal and the Duke
saw one another often, but there were such Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
between 'em, that it was not easie to
link 'em in any strait Union.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal was for none but such as were
wholly devoted to him: and the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>
was not made for Servitude; he was born a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
and had pass'd his Life in a free Country.
Besides, the Commands in the Army were full,
which were the only Things that could oblige
him. So he return'd, having only a general
Knowledge of the Court, and without any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to praise or find fault with the Cardinal:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50645:24"/>
but with a Mind not much disposed to comply
with his way of Governing.</p>
               <p>Some time after, the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> retir'd
to <hi>Sedan,</hi> to withdraw himself from the Effects
of the Cardinal's Hatred.</p>
               <p>Common Fame has published several things as
the Causes of their Disagreement; but all the
World agree, That if the Prince would have
married <hi>Madam de Combalet,</hi> Niece to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
he had design'd things so great for him,
That a Man would scarce venture to speak, and
which would very hardly be believ'd.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> dispatch'd a Gentleman
to Court, to give the Cardinal advice of the
Arrival of <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count;</hi> and to intreat
the King, not to take it ill, that he had afforded
a Retreat to a Prince, who, he thought, had
committed nothing which might displease him,
and in whom he could find none but honourable
Intentions of serving him.</p>
               <p>The King approv'd the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s
Conduct, and the Cardinal wrote him word,
That his Majesty thought fit, that <hi>Monsieur</hi> the
<hi>Count</hi> should continue at <hi>Sedan.</hi> But some time
after, the Negotiations not having produc'd the
Effects which the Cardinal expected from them,
he would have the Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> abandon the
Prince, and make him depart from <hi>Sedan.</hi> The
Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> excus'd himself, and answer'd,
That the King having once approv'd of the
Prince's Stay there, he thought he might give his
Word to him, for his undoubted Security with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
limitation of Time: That such an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to a Prince of the Blood, did not leave
him at the Liberty of proposing such a thing to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50645:25"/>
the Count, as his Retirement: That he pray'd
him to consider these Reasons, and be pleas'd
to apply himself to his Majesty, to gain his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
likewise: That he hop'd the rather
for this Favour from him, because he could as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
him, That <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> preserv'd
inviolably all that Fidelity and Respect which
was due from him to his Majesty: And that he
saw him very much dispos'd to come sincerely to
an Accommodation. In short, he was there at that
time. But <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> being weak and
self-conceited, when he did not make himself
stubborn by Distrust or Fear, he became so by
his Vanity, and Hopes for which he could have
no foundation: besides he had no Person near
him that was fit for Business, which was the
greater Misfortune to him; because, for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality,
even the greatest Men don't maintain
their Grandeur so much by their own, as the
prudent use they make of other Mens Counsels.
So this Prince being thus reduc'd to the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of his own Inclinations, was so uncertain
in his Resolutions, that he never was of the
same mind for two whole days together.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> was
not ignorant of the Consequences which might
attend this refusal he had made, of ordering the
Count to retire from <hi>Sedan.</hi> He knew also the
Irresolution of the Prince: he thought that he
had Honour and Justice on his side; and, at
least, the concern he had for his own Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was sufficient to hinder him from doing any
thing that might blemish it. However it was,
finding himself engag'd, and seeing his own Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
at hand, he resolv'd to close with the Prince,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50645:25"/>
to endeavour to fix him to some one design. He
told him then that in the condition things
were, whatever side he would take, there was no
time to be lost in it; that if he would fall in with
the Cardinal, he should not stay till the beginning
of the Campagn, when the accommodation
would become more difficult, and not so advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious,
or honourable, because it would seem
to have been forc'd. That on the contrary, if
things were past reconciliation between 'em, he
must resolve upon an open War, and take mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
proper to maintain it. That for himself
he would not counsel him on either side, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
in so important an Affair to be Guarantee
for its Event: That he had no reason to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
with the Court: that at present he
had no manner of pretensions there: but that
being resolv'd to hazard all things for his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
it was necessary to consider what might
happen in case they should take Arms: That he
had not alter'd his resolutions, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
would confirm whatever Promises he had
made him; and that he beseeched him to believe
that nothing was able to stir him: But that he
had no mind to let himself be Besieg'd in <hi>Sedan;</hi>
that he knew a great many Troops were drawn
out upon the Frontiers, and that if he would not
come to Agreement with the Cardinal, he should
put himself into a condition of being in the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagn
as soon as ever the Season would permit.</p>
               <p>Whether <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> found himself
this day more dispos'd to determine for War,
than he was the day before; or whether he were
pusht forward by the Duke's Reasons, and the
renewing of his Promises, He at last assur'd him,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50645:26"/>
that he would come to no Terms with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal;
and to shew him, that for his part he
would hearken to nothing, he proposed to him
a Treaty with the Emperour and the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> saw plainly, that by their
Succours it was impossible to set an Army on
Foot that should be able to resist the Kings, and
to hinder the Siege of <hi>Sedan,</hi> or the ravaging of
the Country. Nevertheless one day, that He
might let the Prince recollect, that it was not
he had lead him a march of so great consequence,
he took occasion to lay before him all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
that were to be expected. It is not to be
doubted, said he, but that the Emperour and the
Spaniard will agree to all the Proposals, that shall
be made them on our side. 'Tis their common Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
to agree to every thing till You are Imbarkt
in their Affairs, and afterwards to stand to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is advantagious to themselves:
they will easily give some Money to begin the
War, and send Troops to maintain it for the
present; but afterwards they'll take care their
Words and their Engagements shall be no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
to them; they will support us only to make
Diversions, and facilitate their other designs:
but their interest and ours will always be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
at the bottom: It is ours to endeavour
to enter <hi>France,</hi> to ruine the Fortunes of
the Cardinal: we must look for our Security
and advantage in a Peace, and the Establishment
of a new Ministry; They on the contrary, would
have our condition beyond retrieving, and this
Ministry to subsist to be a perpetual Cause of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
and trouble, which they may work their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50645:26"/>
ends by. But if we should be so unhappy, as to
be forc'd to give our selves intirely up to them,
as it must happen, if we be not succour'd from
within the Kingdom, or upheld by some great
Success; the War, which we have undertaken,
beginning to be reduc'd to a common War,
You will become a Charge to 'em, by reason of
Your Quality; and when they have no Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for You, you may quickly judge whether
they will have any for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> was not shocked by all these
Reasons; the fear of the Cardinal made him
dread nothing else but the falling into his hands.
They concerted therefore what were their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Interests, and all that they had to do: They
made a double Instrument, which both of them
sign'd; in which, among other things, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
never to treat separately. Afterwards
they sent to the Emperor, and the Cardinal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
who commanded in <hi>Flanders</hi> for the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</hi>
The Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> for his part, sent
the Baron <hi>de Beauveau,</hi> a Man of great Quality,
and of a Conduct and Courage which made him
always contemn Fortune, and dangers. At the
same time the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> flying likewise from
the Cardinal's Persecution, came to <hi>Sedan,</hi> and
finding things in this posture, desir'd, That he
might enter into the same Alliances, with the
Emperor and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as the Prince, and the
Duke <hi>de Bouillon.</hi> He gave <hi>Beauveau</hi> powers to
treat for him: but afterwards, impatient to
wait for his return, or rather push'd on by the
Antipathy, which <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> had to him,
he went to <hi>Brussels,</hi> under pretence of labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to further the Treaty by his presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:50645:27"/>
He was a Prince well-shap'd, liberal and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent.
He had a great deal of Courage, and
seem'd to have as much Wit. He was then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
young, and so they attributed to his Age his
great Inconstancy, and several other things,
which were blameable in his Conduct. But the
Actions of his whole Life having been always
Youthful, there is reason to believe, That at
the bottom these Faults proceeded from his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and not from his Age.</p>
               <p>Whilst <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> attended the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of this Negotiation, he sent secretly into
<hi>France,</hi> to endeavour to raise Money from his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and to establish a Correspondence with
the Cardinal's Enemies. They were strong, and
in great number, but they were dejected, not
only by reason of his Power, and the frequent
Examples of his Revenge and Punishments: But
rather, because Treachery being sure to meet
with a Reward, all Confidence seem'd to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
from among Men: and so were absolutely
perswaded, That there could be no Security in
the most secret Transactions. As for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they were universally dispos'd to a Revolt:
for in all times, a long Ministry, let it be good
or bad, will procure their Hatred, and whether
it proceed from their natural Inconstancy, or
their real Misery, they always place their Hopes
in a Change.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Cardinal order'd great
Magazines to be made upon the Frontiers, for
the Subsistence of the Army, that it might be
sooner than ordinary in the Field.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> for his part, began to
prepare for the War, and all the Consequences
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50645:27"/>
of it, that he could fore-see. He made 'em
work upon the Fortifications of <hi>Sedan,</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the Town and Castle with all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for a long Siege. He ingag'd several Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
both Horse and Foot, whom he had seen
serve in <hi>Holland,</hi> and made Levies in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
of <hi>Liege,</hi> with which he reinforc'd the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</p>
               <p>Things were in this Posture about the End of
<hi>May,</hi> when the Baron of <hi>Beauveau</hi> came to
<hi>Sedan,</hi> with as ample a Treaty as they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
signed by the Cardinal Infant for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
and the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperour promis'd Seven thousand Men,
and the Archduke as many for the <hi>Spaniard;</hi>
and these two Bodies join'd together, were
to rendezvouze near <hi>Sedan</hi> in the Month of
<hi>June.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> likewise engag'd to send Two
hundred thousand Crowns, to make new Levies,
or to be employ'd as <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count,</hi> and the
Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> should judge most proper for
their Designs. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gave but one
half of the Money which they had promised.
Nor did they send that in the time they were
oblig'd to, and they fail'd intirely as to the
Troops. The Emperour perform'd his part;
he sent General <hi>Lamboy</hi> with Seven thousand
Men which he was to furnish. During this, the
Mareschal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> came into the Field to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of <hi>May,</hi> and advanced towards
<hi>Sedan,</hi> as if he would invest it, but he return'd
by the way of <hi>Monzon,</hi> without attempting any
thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50645:28"/>
The Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> seeing him so near, and
judging, that nothing was to be expected from
the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> propos'd to the Prince the send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Lamboy,</hi> to make him draw nearer. <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy</hi>
answer'd, That he had no Orders to pass fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without the <hi>Spanish</hi> Troops. <hi>Monsieur</hi> the
<hi>Count</hi> and the Duke sent back to him, to propose
a Place for a Conference with him. He accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it; and the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> went to meet
him. He endeavour'd to make him understand,
of what Importance it would be, to let <hi>France</hi>
see, That they had an Army near enough to
Mareschal <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> to be able to oppose his
Designs. But seeing he could not move him, by
Reasons drawn from the common Interest, and
that he had detach'd the Troops of his Army to
send towards <hi>Aire;</hi> he declar'd to him, at last,
That <hi>Monsieur</hi> the Count and he would go, and
make what Terms they could, unless he drew
nearer to <hi>Sedan,</hi> and engag'd to enter <hi>France</hi>
with them, after they had join'd all their
Forces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lamboy,</hi> seeing things in this Extremity,
chang'd his Resolution; promis'd to march, and
to be in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Sedan,</hi> within
three days, with his Troops.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> sent a Gentleman imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count,</hi> to acquaint him
with the Success of his Negotiation, and staid
himself behind, that he might send down the
Boats he found upon the <hi>Meuse,</hi> to make a
Bridge there, to avoid the letting <hi>Lamboy</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
pass through <hi>Sedan.</hi> When he had set them
at work about it, <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> came to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50645:28"/>
him, under pretence of seeing what they did.
The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> having entertained him
some time, with the Discourse of their Affairs,
had no great difficulty to discover, that some
other Motive brought him thither. He found
his Mind so possess'd with the Thoughts of an
Accommodation, That though he was satisfied
before of his proneness to change, yet he was
surpriz'd at it, and could not forbear telling
him so, <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> told him, That
since he parted to go to the Rendezvouze of
<hi>Lamboy</hi>'s Army, he had receiv'd a Letter from
the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> his Brother-in-Law,
which seem'd to open a Passage to a Negotiation
between the Cardinal and him, and judging,
that in this Conjuncture they had all the Reason
in the World to fear the Difficulties which
<hi>Lamboy</hi>'s Approach might put them to; he
thought it was Prudence to let himself appear
more irreconcileable than ordinary: that he
had sent a Gentleman, that he could conside in,
to the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> and that, till he was
return'd, he would endeavour to keep <hi>Lamboy</hi>
on the other side the <hi>Meuse.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
answer'd him, That the making such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
to <hi>Lamboy</hi> must be the Ruine of all their
Affairs: for having press'd him to the degree
we have done, What Reason have we, says he,
to put the Change upon him, so soon and so
grosly: it must be easie for him, to see there
can be no other cause, but a Treaty with the
Court, and then it can't be doubted, but he will
retire and leave us expos'd to unavoidable Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
That it was the Count's business, to shew
himself at the Head of an Army on the other
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50645:29"/>
side of the <hi>Meuse:</hi> That then would be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Time and Place to consider what Proposals
to make 'em: And that this March alone would
add a great Reputation to their Arms.</p>
               <p>Though these Reasons seem'd to the Duke of
<hi>Bouillon,</hi> to have made a deep Impression upon
the Mind of the Prince; yet to prevent any
thing that might be apprehended from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
Condition that he saw him in; <hi>Lamboy</hi>
was no sooner arriv'd, but he made him pass the
<hi>Meuse</hi> with his Army.</p>
               <p>In the interim, it being the Nature of Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
which proceeds from Weakness, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in proportion to the Instances that are
made for a speedy Resolve: <hi>Monsieur</hi> the
<hi>Count</hi> was no sooner return'd to <hi>Sedan,</hi> but
he was more unresolv'd than ever. In this
Case he thought the Dutchess of <hi>Bouillon</hi> the
most proper Person in the World to second
his Intentions. He went to find her; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reason'd with her, upon the State of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
he oblig'd her to write to her Husband,
all that Prudence or Tenderness could possibly
inspire her with; and to send <hi>Chadirac,</hi> one of
his Secretaries, in whom he had a great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to endeavour, at least, to perswade
him to let <hi>Lamboy</hi>'s Army lie encamp'd under
<hi>Sedan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> after having receiv'd
the Letter, and heard all that <hi>Chadirac</hi> had to
lay before him, answer'd him, that he knew
very well the danger they were in, which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
was augmented, rather by the weakness of
<hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count,</hi> than the Power of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50645:29"/>
That as to what related to his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
he saw reason to be afraid of any accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
that should be made without a Sword
in their hands: that it could not lay open to
him the prospect of any Hopes, nor leave him
so much as any reasonable pretence of making
any Demand: that on the other hand, it was
not to be doubted, but the Cardinal, either
sooner or later, would be reveng'd of him for
those Advantages which he must be forc'd to let
<hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> have over Him. But that if
they could push things forward, one lucky Event
in the beginning of the Campagn, would make all
<hi>France</hi> take Arms, and overturn the Cardinal's
whole Fortune.</p>
               <p>That he had advice there were great Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and that the Favour that <hi>Cinq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars,</hi>
Master of the Horse, was in at Court, had
already made Parties there; that in short he
should find greater Security and Advantages in
pursuing the War, than in any Peace could be
made, as things stood at present. That besides,
as he had before told the Prince, <hi>Lamboy</hi> would
assuredly Retreat, the very first moment that he
saw him change his design, not being able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
the Cause of it to any thing but an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
with the Cardinal. That this
was an Argument beyond reply, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to show, that they must have nothing
to do with new Projects.</p>
               <p>Our Forces, <hi>continued he,</hi> when together, are
above ten thousand Men, and the Marshal <hi>de
Chatillon</hi> has not more. There is nothing
further then to be weigh'd, either we must
fight him, or force him to retire. <hi>Lamboy</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50645:30"/>
agreed with me in this, when I made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to advance towards his Entrance into
<hi>France.</hi> If we gain the Battle we have all before
us. And after having hazarded so much as I have
done, to serve the Interest of <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count,</hi>
Victory may then give me leave to put forward
my own Pretensions. But if Fortune prove ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
to us, we may at least gather this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
from our ill Success, that our Retreat to
<hi>Sedan,</hi> and so great a Resistance as ours will be,
will show how far we are Imbark'd in these Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and then our Friends, both in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and without, will think themselves oblig'd
to hinder us from falling.</p>
               <p>When the Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> had spoke thus to
<hi>Chadirac,</hi> he sent him back, and order'd him to
tell the Count, that <hi>Lamboy</hi>'s Troops had pass'd
the <hi>Meuse</hi> before break of day, and that as soon
as he had join'd them, and they were Encamp'd
together, he would come to him to concert
their final Resolution. In the mean time, a Party,
the Duke had sent out, brought him word that
Marshal <hi>Chatillon</hi> had Decamp'd, and some of
the Prisoners that were taken affirm'd, that his
Design was to Post himself upon the <hi>Meuse,</hi> near
<hi>Sedan,</hi> to hinder <hi>Lamboy</hi>'s Passage.</p>
               <p>After the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had receiv'd this
Advice, and had made <hi>Lamboy</hi> pass the River,
he went to find <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count,</hi> to acquaint
him how things went, and to let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that now, without any further delay, it
was necessary to march up to Marshal <hi>Chatillon.
Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> agreed with him, and the
Duke finding him so well dispos'd, us'd all his
endeavours to oblige him to tarry in <hi>Sedan.</hi> He
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50645:30"/>
offer'd to leave him absolute Master there; and
told him, that in the Progress of the War, he
would find other occasions enough to signalize
his Courage, but that at the beginning he ought
above all things to preserve his own Person.
That as for himself, supposing he should fall in
the Fight, it would be a great Consolation to
him to know, that He was in Safety, and in a
Condition to preserve his Wife and Children
from being expos'd to the Vengeance of their
common Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> not only refus'd to tarry
in <hi>Sedan,</hi> but propos'd it to the Duke to tarry
there himself; and to let him alone run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of a War, in which the Duke was engag'd
only upon his Consideration.</p>
               <p>This generous contest was concluded by their
Resolution, that both should march. The same
day the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> having heard Mass, and
taken the Sacrament at the Capuchins Church,
and afterwards left Orders in <hi>Sedan,</hi> and
sign'd some Papers that he judg'd necessary for
his Houshold; return'd to the Army, and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur</hi>
the <hi>Count</hi> came thither likewise some hours
afterwards.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Marshal <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> who
was an undaunted General, but incredibly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
being perswaded that <hi>Lamboy</hi>'s Forces
were still on the other side the <hi>Meuse,</hi> march'd
to oppose his Passage. But he found the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon</hi> at the head of them, who having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of his march was advanc'd with a great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Horse, and being drawn up on a rising
ground, had plac'd his Squadrons so thick, that
they could not see there were any Foot to support
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50645:31"/>
him. Then he immediately secur'd all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thereabouts, that might incommode the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
In the mean time <hi>Lamboy</hi> came up with the
Infantry, and Cannon, and <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count</hi>
with his Troops.</p>
               <p>The two Armies being thus drawn out, and
ready to join Battel, the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> rode
up to the reserv'd Body, where <hi>Monsieur</hi> the
<hi>Count</hi> was. He found him at Confession, behind
a Bush, which was his third time that same day.
Having tarried a little time to speak with him,
he heard the Cannon: so being in hast to return,
He charg'd the Captain of the Count's Guards,
to tell him, That, as things stood, it was of the
utmost importance not to delay Fighting one
moment, and that he was going to give the
Onset.</p>
               <p>I shall not relate the particulars of this Fight,
there are several Printed Accounts of it: and if
I should repeat the Praises which are there given
to the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> I should seem, instead
of the Memoirs of his Life, to have undertaken
his Panegyrick.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> with his Horse, charg'd
those of the Enemy, and broke 'em; so that
falling back upon their own Infantry, they cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
so great a Disorder, that in a little time
the whole Army was Routed.</p>
               <p>All things went likewise well on <hi>Lamboy</hi>'s side,
who fought like a Captain, and a Man of Courage.
There was no brave resistance made but by the
Cannon, which the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> attack'd
with great hazard of his own Person: But after
he had taken and routed the Troops that he
found there, there appear'd no Body of Men
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50645:31"/>
that could rally again sufficient to make a Stand.
Then the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> seeing himself near
the place where <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> was, went
himself to acquaint him with the Defeat of his
Enemies; but found him dead.</p>
               <p>The Fate of this Prince is the more strange
and unfortunate, because he lost his Life without
having fought, and lost it even after the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
encompass'd with his Guards and several
Gentlemen, and no one yet could ever truly
know, by whom, nor how he was slain. As for
my own part, having laid together all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
that those who were then about him
have related, I am perswaded, that he kill'd
himself. This was likewise the Opinion of the
Duke of <hi>Bouillon.</hi> For it is certain, that he
twice lifted up the Visor of his Helmet with the
Barrel of one of his Pistols; and that <hi>Riquemont,</hi>
his Gentleman of the Horse, fore-warn'd him
of the danger that might happen by it. It is
certain, that the Blow was in the middle of his
Forehead, and that the Shot was so near, that
the Paper went into his Head. Nevertheless, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the very moment he gave himself this
Blow, it chanced, that no one's Eyes were upon
him: the Shame and Despair of those that were
about him; and, above all, the great Prejudice
they had to the Cardinal, made 'em say, That
it was he that had caus'd him to be assassinated,
by a Traytour, who had mix'd himself with
his Guards.</p>
               <p>If we consider throughly, how much the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had hazarded for <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count,</hi>
we cannot doubt the Interest he had in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of his Person. And then, if we judge
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50645:32"/>
into what a Condition the gaining of this Battle
would have put the Fortune of the Prince; it
will be no hard thing to comprehend how great a
loss his Death must be every way to the Duke of
<hi>Bouillon,</hi> and consequently how great his Sorrow
for him. In the mean time, knowing of what
Importance it is, to hinder the Disorder, which
generally happens in an Army, through the
Desire of Spoil, and Heat of Victory; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
immediately, and omitted nothing that
might secure it to him. It was so intire, that
the Mareschal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> lost all his Infantry,
and almost all the principal Officers were slain
or taken Prisoners.</p>
               <p>The same day the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> sent <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laignac</hi>
to the Cardinal Infant to carry him the
News of the Victory, and Death of the Count;
and to assure him, at the same time, that the
Treaty between the Prince and him being mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
he was ready to maintain it in every part,
provided he would oblige the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their parts for the future, and prepare
what they had been wanting in heretofore.</p>
               <p>Whilst the Return of <hi>Salaignac</hi> was expected,
the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> with General <hi>Lamboy,</hi>
went to besiege <hi>Doncheri,</hi> a Place upon the
<hi>Meuse,</hi> two Leagues from <hi>Sedan.</hi> He carried it
in four days: after this, he was for marching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France,</hi> being perswaded, that if the Fame
of his Victory had already rais'd the Hopes of
the Cardinal's Enemies; yet the Death of the
Count, which they must, no doubt, have had
notice of, at the same time, would put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Consternation: so that it was of very great
Consequence, to let 'em see, by the continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50645:32"/>
of their Progress, That the Party did still
subsist. But <hi>Lamboy,</hi> without contradicting the
Duke's Reasons, propos'd only the deferring it
for some days, till he had refresh'd his Troops.
During all this Interval, what-ever Instances the
Duke could make, it was impossible to oblige
him to march further; on the contrary, he sent
Three of his best Regiments to <hi>Aire:</hi> and, after
that, repass'd the <hi>Meuse,</hi> to follow the Cardinal
Infant, who march'd to the Succour of <hi>Aire,</hi>
and who had sent him Orders to join him.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> in a little time after, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
from <hi>Brussels,</hi> retir'd with <hi>Lamboy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
offended, that the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> did
not stay for his Arrival before he fought.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> made a Gentleman go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, to tell him, That to follow the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
when they had abandon'd him, did not look like
a Performance of the Treaty which they two had
sign'd. If he had any Designs, that respected
their common Interests, it was necessary they
should concert them; and that, if he would
give him a Meeting, he would be sure not to
fail him. The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> return'd Answer,
That he would be at <hi>Sedan</hi> in three days, and
there they would take their Measures. However,
he did not come back, nor was there one word
heard of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lamboy,</hi> to whom the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> made
a Compliment, by the same Gentleman, wrote
him a Letter, the Original of which is in my
keeping, and which shews the very great Esteem
he had of him. After, having spoke to him of
his private Concerns, touching the Prisoners he
had left at <hi>Sedan,</hi> and the Cannon taken in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50645:33"/>
Fight, He added these very Words: <q>As for
what remains, my Lord, I see your Highness
is about making your Peace with <hi>France;</hi> upon
which Subject I have nothing to say. But it is
with great Regret, that I see my self remov'd
from serving any longer under the Command
of so great a Captain; to whom I shall always
continue, and with Respect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> seeing himself in this
manner abandon'd, sent back <hi>Salaignac</hi> with
speed, to the Cardinal Infant, with an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
signed by himself. He first complain'd,
That since the Death of <hi>Monsieur</hi> the Count, he
had never vouchsafed to send any Person to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the part he took in so considerable a Loss,
both for the Quality of the Person, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the Party: That in the very Letter that
he had receiv'd from his Royal Highness, by the
Hands of <hi>Salaignac,</hi> he was so far from speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Count, in terms due to a Prince of
the Blood Royal of <hi>France,</hi> That he had mixt
him, without distinction, with Persons that were
not of equal Birth, when he spoke of the Duke
of <hi>Guise</hi> and himself: He assur'd him further,
That he was ready to execute the Treaty: But
he declar'd, he would not stand to it, unless
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would perform what was behind,
and both the Emperour and they immediately
send the Troops and Money, which they had
promis'd, for the carrying on the War. He
spoke also of Money advanc'd, and Losses both
by the King's Army, and <hi>Lamboy</hi>'s. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the Freedom with which he had acted du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the War: He left it to others, to tell him
how much he had contributed to the gaining of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50645:33"/>
the Day; and desir'd his Royal Highness to be
pleas'd to consider, That the Posture their Affairs
were in, appear'd so advantagious, that there
was nothing they might not hope for, if he
would but put him into a Condition of pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Victory. He further added; That he
should take the delays made in answering him
and not satisfying his Demands, for a manifest
Rupture: That in this case he must be off of the
word he had given, and charg'd <hi>Salaignac</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Papers he had sign'd; protesting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> That having been
abandon'd, without Regard had to the Faith of
a solemn Treaty, nor to the Advantages of a
Battle gain'd, and a Town taken; he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to seek his Safety in an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Answer of the Cardinal Infant, was fill'd
with nothing but the Praises of the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon,</hi>
and the Examples of those who had been
ruin'd by confiding in Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> after
having once declared against him: but he avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any positive Answer to his Demands and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances,
and concluded in these Words:
<q>If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (says he) have failed in
their part of the Treaty, the Emperour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
executed his, 'tis just, that his Highness
should address himself to him, for an account
of their Failings, and that he cannot acquit
himself without knowing what he will answer:
But <hi>Lamboy</hi> being retir'd, no Answer that was
to come so far, could be expected, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
him to a manifest Danger.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Mareschal <hi>de Brezè</hi> at the Head of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
had join'd the Mareschal <hi>Chatillon,</hi> since the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50645:34"/>
Battle. The King was likewise advanc'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Frontiers, and come as far as <hi>Rethel:</hi>
so that all the Forces together were Five and
twenty thousand Men.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> seeing himself in this
Extremity, forced to retire into <hi>Sedan,</hi> and to
rely upon his own Forces, doubted not but he
should be besieged. He therefore apply'd all his
Thoughts, to put himself into a Condition to
make a glorious Resistance. In short, it was no
hard matter to imagine, that the Cardinal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd
against him to that degree that he was,
would not have an extreme Desire to ruine him
intirely. But considering the ill Dispositions
that the Court and the rest of the Kingdom had
towards the Cardinal, and the uncertain Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Siege of <hi>Aire;</hi> it was of dangerous
Consequence to undertake that of <hi>Sedan.</hi> Besides
all the considerable Persons about the King,
both the Cardinal's Friends as well as Enemies,
spoke in favour of the Duke of <hi>Bouillon.</hi> The
latter desirous to hinder a Prince that had been
so declar'd an Enemy of the Cardinal's, from
sinking: The others, out of Generosity, seeing
him after so great an Action, expos'd without
any Hope of Succour.</p>
               <p>In short, the King being arriv'd at <hi>Meziers,</hi>
the Cardinal offer'd his Mediation to the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon.</hi> He accepted it with a Confidence
equal to the Sincerity with which it was offer'd
him.</p>
               <p>From the moment that the Negotiation was
begun, and the Truce agreed on, <hi>Cinqmars,</hi>
Master of the Horse to the King, who had been
so far declar'd a Favourite, that he was already
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50645:34"/>
very much suspected by the Cardinal, sought
the Duke of <hi>Bouillon's</hi> Friendship by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of <hi>de Thou,</hi> who made several Journies to
<hi>Sedan,</hi> under pretence of the Obligations and
Friendship that he had for the Duke, but indeed
to offer all things he could hope for, from <hi>Cinq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars.</hi>
He assur'd him, That <hi>Cinqmars</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
laboured very much to mollifie the King,
and to make him recede from that Bitterness
and Anger, which the Cardinal had infus'd into
him.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> answer'd these Offers, and
Advances, with such Decency and good Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as the State of his present Fortune re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
He was convinced, in the Sequel, that
in reality these good Offices had not been unser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Peace was concluded in
the most glorious manner that the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
could desire. The Cardinal would appear
in the Treaty as Caution for the Duke of <hi>Bouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
and as Guarantee to Him, that his Majesty
should execute it sincerely, even to the Articles
of the smallest Consequence.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> went to <hi>Meziers,</hi> to see
the King. He was receiv'd there with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Demonstrations of a great Esteem, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Oblivion of what had pass'd. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
omitted nothing to perswade the Duke, that
he heartily desired his Friendship. He told
the King in publick, that he ought to give him
the Command of an Army: and that since, even
with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he had been able to beat the
<hi>French</hi> Forces, there would be nothing that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50645:35"/>
might not be expected from his Experience and
Courage, when he should be at the Head of
them. Nevertheless, after all, upon Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of what had happened before, and the
general Notion that the World had of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's
Reconciliations, the more Earnestness he
express'd to the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> the less Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
the Duke had of his Sincerity.</p>
               <p>The King went not into <hi>Sedan,</hi> nor did the
Cardinal; <hi>Cinqmars</hi> went to Dinner there with
several of his Friends. The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>
generally was visited by all the Court, and they
could not refrain speaking of the extraordinary
Esteem they had of him: for as what he had
done in the Day of Battle, and throughout the
whole War, had increas'd his Reputation in
Arms; so his Praises were no less, for having
dar'd to declare himself against so great a King,
and so powerful a Minister; and to put his
whole Family and Fortune to the Hazard of a
Battle, rather than dismiss an unfortunate
Prince that had come to him for Refuge.</p>
               <p>The Peace being thus concluded, the King
return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
at <hi>Sedan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As he was very well instructed in his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and had constantly such Thoughts as became
a sound Christian; so he always attributed the
Success of his Affairs to God: and by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers that he caus'd to be made, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
him Thanks for the Dangers from which
he had been deliver'd. It might seem proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that after having come off with so much
Glory and Success, he should have applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to a more quiet way of Life; but he was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50645:35"/>
not born for Repose: and after what had pass'd,
the uncertainty how he should manage himself
in Peace, did, for some days, distract his Mind
with no fewer Perplexities, than he had strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with during the War. What Insight so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he might have into things, and though his
natural Temper might be never so far from Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolution,
yet it was not easie to determine in
his Circumstances. Each side that he could
take had great Inconveniencies. To make a long
stay at <hi>Sedan,</hi> and to frame Pretexts for not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thence, was to make <hi>France</hi> suspect him, to
expose himself to new Dangers, and to bar up
the only way he had left to Glory and Fortune.
Should he take up a Resolution of still pushing
on the War, what Succours could he expect
from the Emperour and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who
had so cruelly abandon'd him, and in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
where their own Interests should have
oblig'd 'em to uphold him, though they had not
been bound to it by their Engagements. To go
to Court; what Security for him there? He
that had been the Soul of the only Party that
had ever durst directly form it self against
the Cardinal. He that had Printed a <hi>Manifesto</hi>
at <hi>Sedan</hi> that reflected so much upon his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.
He that had gain'd a Battle, and made
too Honourable a Peace to have it ever effac'd
out of the Cardinal's Memory. And the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
was too well known to imagine, that he
could ever dis-unite the Remembrance of an
Injury, and the Desire of revenging it.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> reckon'd, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Vexations of his Life, were those he suffer'd
under these Uncertainties. They must, in effect,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50645:36"/>
have been to him so much the greater, because I
have often heard him say, That between two sides,
he had much rather take the worst, than not take
any; because all would fall to Ruine, by doing
nothing, whereas, by Time and Action, one might
expect a happy Event of those Affairs, which
appear'd most desperate in their beginning. At
last, having weigh'd all things, he resolv'd to
go to Court, and carry his Wife and Children
thither; and to shew that he acted with an open
Confidence, he resolv'd to go and make some
stay at <hi>Turenne,</hi> and some other Seats that he
had in <hi>Guyenne.</hi>

               <head>THE
Second BOOK.</head>
               <p>THE Battle of <hi>Sedan</hi> was fought on the
sixth of <hi>July.</hi> The Treaty of Peace
was Sign'd at <hi>Meziers</hi> the eight of
<hi>August,</hi> and about the fifteenth of
<hi>September,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> parted from <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
in his way to Court. He found it at <hi>Nesle</hi>
in <hi>Picardy. De Thou</hi> went before him, and <hi>Cinq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi>
came to visit him as soon as he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd.</p>
               <p>By the King's Reception, and the Cardinal's
acting with him, he had just reason to believe,
that things were in the same posture he had left
them. In the mean time <hi>De Thou</hi> omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which he thought proper to fasten those
tyes which he had begun between the Duke of
<hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Cinqmars;</hi> and he thought he could
not give the Duke more substantial Proofs of his
steadiness and Friendship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>De Thou</hi> had Wit, Honesty, Courage, and
very noble Intentions: but his too great activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
made him enter upon several Projects which
would undoubtedly have been rejected by one
who had been more capable of making deeper
reflections. He began with the Long Robe, some
time after he was for the Sword. So at last he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50645:37"/>
had no profession at all: which must be look'd
upon as one of the most disagreeable Conditions
that a Man of Merit can find himself reduced to.
Amidst those different states which show'd some
uneasiness in him, he still preserv'd the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of great Honesty. He was then disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the Cardinal about some Employment in
the Army, that had been refus'd him, and this
discontent, without doubt, did in some measure
animate him against this Minister. In short, <hi>De
Thou</hi> was resolv'd to ruine him. He believ'd,
that as for this World, he could undertake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that would be more Glorious, and that
before God he could do nothing more just. The
Cardinal's Power seem'd to him to decrease every
day; and <hi>Cinqmars</hi> on the contrary, to advance
in favour, insomuch, that he was now entire
Master of the King's Affections. Amidst so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
prejudices, it is scarce credible, but that
when <hi>De Thou</hi> laid down his Platform of the
Court to the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> he allow'd some
thing to his own Passions. There is a great deal
of probability likewise, that it was he who made
<hi>Cinqmars</hi> desire of the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> that he
might have an opportunity of discoursing with
him freely, to tell him how he stood with the
King, and askt what his advice might be, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Cardinal: But when <hi>De Thou</hi> made
this Proposal to the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
that nothing could be more dangerous
to him, and even to <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> than to let the
least suspicion arise of their holding secret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence.
That the Cardinal having infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the minutest particulars, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for them to have any private Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50645:37"/>
especially in such a place as <hi>Nesle,</hi> that should
not come to his knowledge. The Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
therefore desir'd <hi>De Thou</hi> to divert <hi>Cinq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi>
from this thought; and to let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that it was the Consideration of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Interest which hinder'd him from comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with it. He told <hi>De Thou</hi> farther, as a
Friend, that he was desirous to live fairly with
<hi>Cinqmars,</hi> and to return the advances he had
made him, and the good Offices he had receiv'd;
but that these good Offices were not of so high a
nature as to oblige him to be drawn blindly into
his Interests: That in short he had no mind to
Re-imbark himself in new troubles, but that as
things stood then, the infallible way of doing it
would be to intermeddle with <hi>Cinqmars</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
That if the Cardinal and <hi>Cinqmars</hi> were
private Persons, then he should make no scruple
of declaring for <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> but that he could look
upon neither of them in such a respect; not the
Cardinal, by reason of his quality as first Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
nor <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> as being the King's profest
Favourite. <hi>De Thou</hi> promis'd the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
to manage things so, that <hi>Cinqmars</hi> his
good inclinations towards him should not be
in the least alter'd. And indeed the Duke of
<hi>Bouillon</hi> meeting him next day in the King's
Apartment, he found an opportunity to tell
him, that there was nothing he design'd more
passionately than his Friendship; but that he had
pray'd <hi>Monsieur de Thou</hi> to tell him, that he
would never ask it till he had merited it by
some considerable Service. The Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
answer'd him with a general Complement,
and for the rest refer'd him to what <hi>Monsieur de
Thou</hi> would say in his behalf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:50645:38"/>
When the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> went to <hi>Nesle,</hi> he
sent the Dutchess his Lady, and his Children, to
<hi>Paris,</hi> to tarry for him there, with a design not
to go thither till the King went. But seeing that
he would remain some time in <hi>Picardy,</hi> the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon</hi> staid but ten or twelve Days, hasten'd
by the Season to make his Journey into <hi>Guyenne,</hi>
and indeed hasten'd more by his desire to quit
the Court, judging that as he saw things stand,
it was prudence in him to make no long stay
there.</p>
               <p>After taking leave of the King and Cardinal,
he went to bid <hi>Cinqmars</hi> adieu, who renew'd to
him all the Protestations he had already made,
and told him, that when any thing, which he
ought to be inform'd of, should come to his
Knowledge, he would apply himself to <hi>De Thou,</hi>
to acquaint him with it. The Duke told him,
that if he would take this pains, he could not
Communicate to any Man better, nor in whom
he plac'd a more entire Confidence than in <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Thou.</hi> They parted in this manner, that
is, very kindly, but without entring upon any
thing particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cinqmars</hi> was very well Shap'd, and very
Amiable. He had Courage, a Sprightly Wit,
Bold, Capable of great Undertakings, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
in his pursuing them, with great Art and
much Application. But being no more than
one and twenty, he wanted Experience; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
he was Untractable, and Presumptuous,
which are generally the inseparable faults of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and Youth: And these faults are so much
the more dangerous, because presumption enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
them in rash Actions; and refusing to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50645:38"/>
hinders their abandonning 'em. So <hi>Cinqmars,</hi>
what Remonstrances soever his Friends could
make, he could never overcome the Hatred he
had conceived for the Cardinal. If he had only
been capable of moderating it, could he but
have subdued it before the King, there had been
no Greatness to which in time he might not have
pretended, considering the violent Inclinations of
his Master towards him, and the Age and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition
of the Cardinal. But, in short, it was
impossible for him to manage these two Points,
with a Conduct that should be lasting; whether
'twas by the Fatality of his Destiny, or because
Men are not yet arriv'd to that Pitch of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to know when to stop the Career of their
Fortune, so as to be able to fix it. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Impatience <hi>Cinqmars</hi> might have for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his Fortune, yet he could not relinquish the
Pursuit of his own Pleasures, and that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable
Aversion he had for those of the King:
for this Prince being inclin'd to Piety, he us'd
to seek his Recreations in some innocent Amuze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
so that what pleased and diverted him,
overwhelm'd his Favourite with Melancholy and
Uneasiness.</p>
               <p>The Abbot <hi>de Beaumont</hi> then in the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's
Service, since Praeceptor to the King and
Archbishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> has told me, That one
day his Master having sent him to <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> to
acquaint him that the King was very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd
against him; he found him in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
with Tears in his Eyes, bewailing his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny.
He said, several times, he had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all, than endure that Life any longer,
which the King made him lead. In short, he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50645:39"/>
was in such violent Passions, that <hi>Beaumont</hi> was
scarce able to let him understand, that the
King's whole Discontent proceeded from this,
That upon his Return from the Chase of <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau</hi>
he seem'd so weary, that he could not stay
a moment in the King's Apartment, who was
retir'd into his Closet on purpose to call him
only to him. The Cardinal, in the beginning
took care of <hi>Cinqmars</hi>'s Conduct; He had, in
some measure, promoted his Fortune, for the
Friendship he had with Mareschal <hi>de Fiat,</hi> his
Father, who ow'd his Fortune to him: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it might he, because he knew the Place of
Favourite could not be void; and seeing the
great Inclination the King had to <hi>Cinqmars,</hi>
he might think it better to follow than op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it.</p>
               <p>At the Return of the Court from <hi>Picardy,
Cinqmars</hi> desired of the King to make him of
the Council. He thought the Cardinal could
have no Pretence to oppose him in this, since he
could not be ignorant that the King gave him
an account of every thing that pass'd there,
though the most secret and most important.
When the King first made the Proposal, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
was so far transported as to say, That it
was enough to make his Affairs despicable in
foreign Countries, to let it be seen, that so
small a Head-piece, as <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> should have any
part in them. Afterwards he sent for him, and
told him himself, what he had said to the King;
to which he added some things so offensive, that
<hi>Cinqmars,</hi> raging with Grief, flew from him
like one distracted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:50645:39"/>
Some few days after, upon the Cardinal's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inform'd that <hi>Cinqmars</hi> was in Love with the
Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> and that he had Thoughts of
marrying Her; he raillied upon it very smartly,
and said, He could not believe this Princess
would so far forget her Birth, as to debase her
self to so mean a Companion. These Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
being told <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> rais'd his Hatred of
Cardinal to the highest Pitch. But these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
made no Noise then, because the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
believ'd it his Interest, not to let these
aspiring Thoughts of <hi>Cinqmars</hi> be seen, and the
Troubles he created him: and <hi>Cinqmars</hi> did not
think it proper for him to reveal to any Person,
the Discourse which he had with the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and the Treatments which he had received
from him.</p>
               <p>Whilst these things pass'd between the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
and <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> took
his Journey into <hi>Guyenne.</hi> Passing by <hi>Orleans,</hi>
Chance would have it, that he should meet the
Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> would
have avoided him, knowing that he had often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
the Hatred he had for him. It was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon this; That at the time this Prince
was retired to <hi>Brussels,</hi> he had often endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bring the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> to his Party,
without having ever been able to engage him in
it. However he receiv'd him very obligingly,
and would make him keep St. <hi>Hubert</hi>'s Feast
with him at <hi>Chaubort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he was arriv'd at <hi>Turenne;</hi> and had
spent some days in looking after the Affairs of
so considerable an Estate, where he had never
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50645:40"/>
been before, he went to that which he had in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigord.</hi>
Being at <hi>Limeuil,</hi> and coming from Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
an unknown Person gave him a Letter, which
<hi>de Thou</hi> had writ to him. He was extremely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
when he saw it dated half a League off from
<hi>Limeuil,</hi> and that <hi>de Thou</hi> desired him to appoint
a Place where he might see him without being
known. He did as <hi>de Thou</hi> requested: and
when they were together <hi>de Thou</hi> told him, that
he was come to desire him earnestly in <hi>Cinqmars</hi>
behalf, to return to Court again, and that his
Return thither would be of very great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> ask'd him the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that might oblige <hi>Cinqmars</hi> to propose to
him the taking of so extraordinary a Journey;
but he was yet more surpriz'd when <hi>de Thou</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
him, that <hi>Cinqmars</hi> had not entrusted
him with them. This Proceeding appear'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
disobliging, in relation to himself, and almost
incredible, in respect of <hi>de Thou.</hi> He told him,
That, being but just come thither, it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for him to return without any Pretence, or
apparent Reason. He desired, he would let
<hi>Cinqmars</hi> understand as much: and yet that he
would not relate to him all his Dissatisfaction:
That something was allowable to his Youth:
That the Favour he was in had likewise its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege:
That he held himself oblig'd to think
the best of <hi>Cinqmars</hi>'s Proceedings, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the kind Offices he had receiv'd
from him, and the Confidence he shew'd he had
of him in <hi>Picardy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About three Weeks after <hi>de Thou</hi> was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from thence, The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> being
at <hi>Turenne,</hi> receiv'd a Letter from the King,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50645:40"/>
which order'd him to come to Court with all
speed. He departed immediately; and as soon
as ever he was in <hi>Paris, de Thou</hi> came to him,
to request him, from <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> to let him speak
with him before he saw either the King or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal.
The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had a great deal
of difficulty to resolve what to do in so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a Conjuncture: nevertheless <hi>de Thou</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
him to consent to it, after he had told
him, what Measures he had taken, that he
might do it without any manner of Fear.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> then ask'd <hi>de Thou,</hi> if
<hi>Cinqmars</hi> had never told him the Reasons of the
Journey, which he had made him take into <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigord?
De Thou</hi> told him, That he knew no
more, at present, than when he parted with
him; But that <hi>Cinqmars</hi> had positively assur'd
him, That, by the Sequel, they should see, that
neither of them should have reason to complain
of the Management he had us'd upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
               <p>The King was then at St. <hi>Germains. De Thou</hi>
carried the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> thither in his
Coach, and by the favour of the Night, and the
Praecautions they had taken, He and <hi>Cinqmars</hi>
saw one another without any one's Knowledge.
<hi>Fontrailles</hi> was in <hi>Cinqmars</hi>'s Chamber. <hi>Cinqmars</hi>
presented him, as his intimate Friend, to the
Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who had never seen him; and
added this at his presenting him, That though
he had an entire Confidence in <hi>Fontrailles,</hi> yet he
should not have took the Liberty of letting
him be at this Interview, without the Consent
of the Duke of <hi>Bouillon;</hi> if he had not thought
there was always more Trust to be given to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50645:41"/>
Persons of Quality, than to Servants; and that
indeed he had sent away all his People, under
pretence of being alone with <hi>Fontrailles,</hi> which
often us'd to happen.</p>
               <p>After their first Compliments, <hi>Fontrailles</hi> and
<hi>de Thou</hi> retired into a Closet: and then <hi>Cinqmars</hi>
began to tell the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> That the
King had not been well since his Return from
<hi>Picardy;</hi> That the Cardinal however had not
desisted from making him resolve upon going
into <hi>Catalonia.</hi> That it was resolv'd much about
the same time, to fetch him from <hi>Turenne,</hi> to
give him the Command of the Army in <hi>Italy;</hi>
and that he judg'd it very necessary for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he saw any Body, to have some Intimation
of it: the rather because he could not perswade
himself that this proceeded from the Cardinal
out of any good Intent, because he lost no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of making ill Impressions of him in the
King's Mind. That he had told him, a little
while agoe, That his Dutchess had too much
Power over him; and that she, in her Heart,
was intirely devoted to <hi>Spain.</hi> That he had
heard, that <hi>Monsieur des Noyers</hi> told the King,
That it was no difficult thing to take <hi>Sedan</hi> from
him; because, being oblig'd by the Treaty of
Protection, to receive the King's Troops into
it; He would have Right to seize on It,
in case he refus'd as many as should be sent
thither. That, in short, the Distrust they had
of him was so great, that the Cardinal thought
nothing of more Importance, than the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
him from returning to <hi>Sedan.</hi> That they
would not permit him even to tarry in <hi>Guyenne,</hi>
and that the manner, in which he had been visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50645:41"/>
had caus'd Suspicions, That, without doubt,
they would send him to <hi>Italy,</hi> only that they
might be able to secure his Person, in case the
King should die. That it would not be difficult
to arrest him in an Army where he should have
no Troops of his own; not one Friend; and
where he was not so much as known, but by his
Reputation. That, let him be never so great a
Captain, he would find himself much expos'd,
by the extraordinary things that the Count <hi>de
Harcourt</hi> had done there. That to come up to
'em, he must be assur'd of as great Fortune as
he had, and have the Ministry as much on his
side. That besides, the main Action would be
either in <hi>Flanders</hi> or <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cinqmars</hi> added; That he now stood fairer
with the King than ever, and that he was not
less secure of <hi>Monsieur</hi>'s Favour to him, whom
he had a little while since acquainted, by the
Count <hi>d' Aubijoux,</hi> of the Resolution that had
been taken, of making him go into <hi>Catalonia;</hi>
but he had advis'd him not to do it, being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the Cardinal's Design was to Arrest
him, if the King should chance to dye there.
That in this case the Cardinal had no small De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
seeing he had propos'd to the King, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
several weak Pretences, to leave the Queen
and her two Children, at the Castle of <hi>Vincennes,</hi>
where <hi>Chavigni,</hi> one of his own Creatures, was
Governour. That they were perswaded the
King could not live long. That it was upon
this Consideration, that the Cardinal was so
much for his Journey into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that his Affairs there required it. That
he doubted not, but that if the King should die
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50645:42"/>
so remote from his Queen and Children, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Master of his Confessour, and all other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
but that he would be so likewise of his
Thoughts when he lay a dying; aud then, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
both the Court and Army at his Command,
his Ambition would have no other Bounds, but
what he himself should prescribe it. I ordered
him further to acquaint <hi>Monsieur,</hi> continued
<hi>Cinqmars,</hi> that in this Extremity I would advise
him to secure the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that, in case the
King should die, the Party he would find in
<hi>France,</hi> might have some Assistance from abroad,
by a Treaty, which should be founded upon a
general Peace; and by this means they might
secure themselves from the Designs of their
common Enemy, the Cardinal. I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
likewise, added he, that the most infallible
means of ruining him, if the King does not
die, is to dispose <hi>Monsieur</hi> to take Arms: For I
having a Correspondence with him, which I will
continue, and seeing the King so often tired
with this Ministry, that he would willingly be
delivered from it, I will order it so, that his
Royal Highness shall not declare, till there is so
favourable a Conjuncture, that I can infallibly
make the King take a final Resolution against
the Cardinal; and I have made a Project for a
Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> which I will shew you.</p>
               <p>Here the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> interrupted him;
and told him he was desirous to explain himself
to him, in relation to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> That he
was just come from under their Hands, and that
he was resolv'd not to get into them again.
That he had too many Proofs of their Breach of
Trust, and their Weakness, that besides, their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50645:42"/>
Divisions among themselves were so great, that
it was impossible for 'em to carry on any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Design, or that in the progress they
should not ruine themselves by their Misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cinqmars</hi> though surpriz'd to the utmost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
at finding the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> so averse to
a Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> and seeing, that in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
of this consequence, he had advanc'd too far,
towards one that would not enter into the same
designs, yet resum'd the Discourse, without
seeming at all concern'd.</p>
               <p>He told the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all these considerations, it would still be
much to their advantage, that <hi>Monsieur</hi> should
make a Treaty with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> because it
would make him more considerable, and that
He, having so much Power over him as he had,
would hinder him from making any use of it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they should afterwards find it absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
After this re-entring upon what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> he assur'd him he
had made his Peace with his Royal Highness, and
that he had so dispos'd him as to clear up those
matters that he said he had reason to complain
of. That the first time his Highness should see
him, perhaps he would tell him the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cinqmars</hi> concluded with remarking to the
Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> how much he ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on him, since he had given him such Proofs of
an entire Confidence. That it was as much as
his Life and Fortune was worth, that this should
be kept secret.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> answer'd, That he
should have no occasion to repent; that he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50645:43"/>
would mention it to no Person breathing. He
requested the same Secrecy from him, as to
what related to the Treaty with <hi>Spain.</hi> He
ask'd if <hi>De Thou</hi> had any knowledge of these
matters, and <hi>Cinqmars</hi> telling him, that he had
never spoke to him about 'em, the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
promis'd him, that he would never menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
'em to him; and added farther, that as for
the Command in <hi>Italy,</hi> he would think of it, and
having weigh'd the Advantages and Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies,
he would take his final Resolution, and
for the rest they might discourse at leisure.</p>
               <p>We may judge, by this whole Discourse of
<hi>Cinqmars,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> retir'd with
matter large enough to employ his Reason and
his Fear. He saw very well, that the Ambition
of <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> and his hatred to the Cardinal,
might make him aggravate several things: but
then, at the same time, to pass a true judgment
of his own Condition, and the present State of
the Court, he would find very great probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for all that had been told him. That which
prest him most, was what to determine about
the employ in <hi>Italy:</hi> the King having sent for
him, upon this account, it was not likely, he
would be long without speaking to him of it:
should he accept it, he had great reason to fear
the Consequence: but in the present Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of their Affairs, there was more danger
yet in refusing it: and to prevent what might
be fear'd upon his refusal, if he should incline to
that side, he must secretly, and with speed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to <hi>Sedan,</hi> as the only means to prevent his
being Arrested.</p>
               <p>This was all that <hi>Cinqmars</hi> and the Cardinals
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50645:43"/>
Enemies could desire, to have him retire to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi>
and indeed to view only the first prospect
of the thing, the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> might see in
it both their common Advantages, and his own
Security: but to search into the Effects of it, he
there must find his undoubted ruine. Besides the
Dutchess of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and his Children being at
<hi>Turenne,</hi> were sufficient Hostages for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
In short, having weigh'd all these things,
he went the next Morning to pay his Duty to
the King, and to see the Cardinal, being resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to receive the Proposal, that should be made
him, as one surpriz'd, but yet as if he were very
well pleas'd at it. The truth is, and I have
heard him say so several times, that he was
touch'd extreamly with the Glory, to see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
sought to, to Command a Royal Army, six
Months after the Battle of <hi>Sedan.</hi> This thought
alone was sufficient to determine him; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, it contributed much to his perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that Fortune and his good Conduct, should
supply all the rest.</p>
               <p>However eight or ten Days pass'd without the
breaking this Design to him: whether the thing
was not yet fully resolv'd on, or because at this
time the King was more indispos'd than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.
This Prince had naturally his health but
ill. He was then so weak, that his Physicians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fear his Life, and to tell this secretly to
their Friends. But as secrets of such consequence
soon become publick Discourse, the Rumour was
spread every where that the King could not last
much longer.</p>
               <p>During the Expectation of so great a Turn,
every one made his own Reflections upon Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50645:44"/>
Affairs, and according to them regulated
the Projects of their own particular Fortunes.
But this Conjuncture being the most nice and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
that ever was known, Fear and Distrust
were encreas'd by the Danger; so that the most
daring Courtiers were afraid to consult to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>The Queen, who had been persecuted by the
Cardinal so many several ways, was in very
great Frights. She doubted not but if the King
should die, this Minister would take her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
from her, to get the Regency into his own
hands; and though these Thoughts were as so
many mortal Blows to her, yet they were not
the ut most of her Fears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monsieur</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who in several
important Occasions of his Life, had likewise
felt the bloody Effects of the Cardinal's Hatred,
could not doubt but He would look on him as
the most formidable Enemy; both for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
he would retain of what had pass'd, and
for the Authority, which his Quality, as onely
Brother to the King, might seem to promise
him, during the time of a Regency.</p>
               <p>Things being in this Condition, we may guess
in what straits the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Having pass'd his Life in the Wars and
out of <hi>France,</hi> He had scarce any more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Court, than what he had gain'd
by the little stay he had made there; and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Parts, how great soever they be, are not
sufficient, without being succour'd by some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
or the Counsels of a sincere Friend,
who is harder to be found in that place, than in
any other in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:50645:44"/>
In the mean time they began to open the
Thoughts they had of sending the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
into <hi>Italy,</hi> and though he had not discover'd
the Resolution he had taken in this Affair, to
any Person: Yet the Courtiers who are always
ready to determine what is to come to pass, being
desirous of Novelties, and upon this Occasion
impatient to have some new Troubles, began
already to say, That he would refuse this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and retire to <hi>Sedan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queen, relying upon this Rumour, or
press'd by her Fears, made <hi>de Thou</hi> search after
him with Secrecy and great Earnestness. She
ordered, that he should first be desired to close
with her Interest, and to give her two Instances
of it, which she thoug<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> very essential: The
first was, to accept the Command in <hi>Italy;</hi> that
there might be such a Person at the Head of an
Army, of whose Merit she was so well assur'd:
The other was; That, if the King should die,
he would promise to receive her into <hi>Sedan,</hi>
with her two Children, not thinking (so well
was she assur'd of the Cardinal's ill Intentions,
and his Power), there was any Place of Safety
for them in all <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>De Thou</hi> likewise told the Duke, that since
the King had been sick, the Queen and the Duke
of <hi>Orleans</hi> had entered into a very strict Union,
and that <hi>Cinqmars</hi> was the Person that had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
it; but that he was the only Man, to
whom this Secret had been intrusted, and he
desired him not to disclose it to any Body
breathing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:50645:45"/>
The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> gave him his Promise;
and, resuming the Discourse, told him, It was
not possible things should ever come to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
that the Children of <hi>France</hi> should have
occasion for such a Retreat: that however they
should always be Masters of <hi>Sedan,</hi> when the
Queen should be pleas'd to send them thither;
and he should look upon it as a very great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to receive 'em there: That as for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
in <hi>Italy;</hi> It had not yet been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to him; but in case it was offered him,
he would act conformably to the Queen's Desire.
Two days after, <hi>de Thou,</hi> out of a motion of
his own, desired the Queen to signifie to the
Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> the satisfaction she took at the
manner in which he answer'd what had been
propos'd to him on her part; which she could
do but in very few words, and that as she was
going to <hi>Mass;</hi> leaving the rest to <hi>de Thou,</hi> as
the Person in whom she had plac'd an entire
Confidence.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the King grew better; and
the Cardinal declar'd to the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi>
that he was design'd to Command the Army in
<hi>Italy.</hi> He spoke to him concerning this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
in very obliging Terms, but us'd not
any single Expression that might shew his Desire
of securing him to his Interests or Fortunes:
Whether he was with-held by the Consideration
of his own Glory, as thinking it below him to
Court any Body: or else, having resolv'd to
Ruine him, he would avoid the Shame of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us'd the Appearances of a real Friendship,
in order to his more certain Destruction. The
Duke, at his Acceptance of the Employment,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50645:45"/>
made his Reply in general Terms, and with
such a Grace, as might become a Man of his
Quality.</p>
               <p>The same day the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to <hi>Paris, Cinqmars</hi> came to him two
hours before Night, to carry him to visit <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur,</hi>
who lay at <hi>Venice</hi>-House, where his Stables
were then.</p>
               <p>After the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had given him Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
by clearing some Passages that had
happened heretofore; <hi>Monsieur</hi> told him all the
obliging things imaginable, earnestly desired his
Friendship, and promis'd to serve him upon all
Occasions. <hi>Cinqmars</hi> added farther, addressing
himself to <hi>Monsieur,</hi> that he thought he had
done him a signal Piece of Service, in bringing
over to his Party, a Person of the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>'s
Quality; who, besides his Personal Merit,
was Master of a Place that was so very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.
Afterwards he spoke of the Cardinal
without any manner of Reserve; he discours'd
at large of what all of them had reason to fear,
if the King should die; and <hi>Fontrailles</hi> and
<hi>d' Aubijoux</hi> being present, he said, 'Twas neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to treat with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Then <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur,</hi>
taking up the Discourse, assur'd 'em he
was going to send <hi>Fontrailles</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and
that he would recommend the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s
Concerns to him, if he was willing to come into
the Treaty. The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> answer'd,
That he had already spoke clearly to that Point
with <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> and that his Opinion was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
Afterwards he represented the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and their Failures in all
their Treaties, more at large than he had done to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50645:46"/>
                  <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> adding, That he doubted not but
their Consideration for <hi>Monsieur</hi>'s Person would
cause 'em to make larger Efforts than they had
done for <hi>Monsieur</hi> the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> and
himself: but that no Praecaution was too great
be taken against their Infidelity and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> as may easily be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was not prepared for this Conversation. In
effect he was very uneasie to find himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to it. But in the mean time, reflecting
upon the Power, which <hi>Monsieur</hi> would have, if
the King should die, and the Union there was
between him and the Queen, which Secret <hi>de
Thou</hi> had entrusted him withal; he thought,
that though he had not given the Satisfaction to
<hi>Monsieur</hi> which he might expect, in relation to
<hi>Spain,</hi> yet at least he must not leave him without
entring further into the Consideration of what
might happen upon the Revolution they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw:
It was his Opinion, That if he should not
deliver his Mind freely as to that Affair, it
would bring a new Negotiation upon him,
which, being manag'd by <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> would make
him lose the Merit of his Resolution, though he
should take one agreeable both to <hi>Monsieur</hi> and
the Queen; because it would seem as if <hi>Cinqmars</hi>
had perswaded him to it. Besides, though the
Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had no Presumption of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which is common even to the greatest Men;
yet he could not but apprehend, what Weight he
might be in a Regency, when at the Head of an
Army, that might maintain the Interests of the
Royal Family against the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:50645:46"/>
These Considerations oblig'd him to re-assume
his Conversation with <hi>Monsieur;</hi> besides he was
willing to prevent the Thoughts they might
have of retiring to <hi>Sedan,</hi> after the Treaty
with <hi>Spain,</hi> having gathered from <hi>Cinqmars</hi> his
Discourse, that they had agreed to propose it to
him.</p>
               <p>He told <hi>Monsieur</hi> therefore, That he did
not know what his Designs were, if the King
should die; but considering the Confidence which
his Highness had done him the Honour to
place in him, he could not but represent to his
Highness, That such a Person, as he, ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to lay the Foundations of his Interest and
Forces within the Kingdom, rather than rely
upon Strangers. That he might have remark'd,
That when the Cardinal look'd upon him as his
Enemy, he omitted nothing that might force
him to go out of <hi>France:</hi> so that there was no
doubt but in a Regency he would be much more
desirous that he should take that Resolution.
That being among the Enemies of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
it would always give a plausible Colour
for suspecting his Intentions, and making the
Parliaments and People abandon his Interests.
That he was not of <hi>Cinqmars</hi> his Opinion, who
thought they could arrest him if the King should
die; That it was a thing without Example;
and though the Cardinal were never so powerful
yet he could not find any Body that would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to execute so rash a Design. That there
was none but the Queen that could contest any
thing with him during the Regency; and that
if he could join Interest with Her Majesty, he
saw no Probability that the Cardinal could so
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50645:47"/>
much as put himself into any condition of resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
'em. However, if upon the King's Death
he should believe it necessary for him to go out
of <hi>France, Sedan</hi> should be an assur'd Retreat for
him, the Queen, and Children of <hi>France,</hi> and
that he would pass his word to espouse no other
Interest but theirs.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Monsieur</hi> took the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and
<hi>Cinqmars,</hi> and carrying them apart from <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailles,</hi>
and <hi>D' Aubijoux,</hi> he acquainted the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon</hi> with the Intelligence that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Queen and him, and concluded with
the testifying his great satisfaction in what he
had told him; either because he really was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
or did not think it proper to advance any
farther Proposals concerning <hi>Sedan,</hi> after such a
Discourse as the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had made
him.</p>
               <p>When the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> found himself
alone with <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> he told him, that though
the Conversation they came from had the success
he desired, yet he could not hide from him the
dissatisfaction he took at the manner with which
the thing was done. For what reason, says he,
was there to insinuate to <hi>Monsieur</hi> such a thing as
a Retreat to <hi>Sedan?</hi> And what necessity of my
speaking before him of a Treaty with <hi>Spain?
Cinqmars</hi> having declar'd to him his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for the trouble he saw him in: All this,
<hi>continued he,</hi> engages you no farther: And I
dare tell you, that considering the state of the
King's Health, I think I have done you a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
piece of Service; not only in reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you to <hi>Monsieur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and in having oblig'd him
to speak to you with so much Freedom: but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50645:47"/>
likewise in that I have so dispos'd him, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
himself entirely up to you, as he will do,
if he follows the design of retiring to <hi>Sedan:</hi>
However I promise you to divert it, if you judge
it inconvenient.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> saw very well that <hi>Cinq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi>
reasons were pure inventions, and that in
effect his design was to engage him to <hi>Monsieur,</hi>
gave him only this Answer; Remember, at
least, that I never made any Promise of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
to <hi>Sedan,</hi> but in case the King should die.
For whilst the King is alive, it would be a very
odd sort of Conduct in me to be my Self at the
Head of one of his Armies, whilst <hi>Monsieur</hi> and
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should make <hi>Sedan</hi> the Stage of a
Civil War.</p>
               <p>The next day the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> related to
<hi>de Thou</hi> the whole Conversation that he had with
<hi>Monsieur,</hi> excepting the particular concerning
the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> He told him likewise what had
pass'd between him and <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> after their
parting with <hi>Monsieur:</hi> adding, that how great
a Favourite soever he might be, yet if in any
other Encounter he should happen to act with
him as he had done upon this occasion, they must
assuredly break, and that he saw very well, that
all the pains which he had taken so officiously,
had no other ground for 'em but a desire to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque
him so far, as that he might be a support
to him against the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>De Thou</hi> did not excuse <hi>Cinqmars.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd,
that Youth made him often drive on fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
than was to be wisht for: and he repeated
it several times to the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> that he
would have him take care not to bring himself
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50645:48"/>
into trouble. These words made him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that <hi>de Thou</hi> knew <hi>Cinqmars</hi> design in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> as in effect the
thing proved afterwards to be true. For <hi>Cinq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi>
had all along intrusted it with <hi>de Thou,</hi>
who had us'd all his endeavours to dissuade him:
But not being able to accomplish it, he had made
<hi>Cinqmars</hi> pass his word to him, that no Person
should know that he had any Cognizance of such
a Treaty, no not so much as the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon.</hi>
In short, we have seen before, how that
<hi>de Thou</hi> rather than open himself to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that matter in their Conversation at <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meuil,</hi>
suffer'd the <hi>Duke</hi> to judge very hardly,
both of his own Conduct and <hi>Cinqmar</hi>'s Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>At the same time the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> ask'd
<hi>de Thou</hi> if he had not heard that the King's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to <hi>Cinqmars</hi> was decreasing. <hi>De Thou</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
that he had heard such a thing, and had
told <hi>Cinqmars</hi> of it, who assur'd him it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
false.</p>
               <p>However, continued <hi>de Thou,</hi> that which
makes me suspect that there may be some ground
for these reports is, that <hi>Cinqmars</hi> ask'd me with
some concern, if they had not spread themselves
as far as the Duke of <hi>Bouillon.</hi> You may easily
see then by this Curiosity, said the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
pleasantly, that I am a Person whom <hi>Cinq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi>
would willingly intrust with the news of
the advancement of his Fortune; but I am not
one to whom he would discover the secret of its
diminution.</p>
               <p>The truth is, as the sequel demonstrated, that
about this time the King began to give <hi>Cinqmars</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:50645:48"/>
great Mortifications, but in private, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
that the Courtiers should take any notice
of it; either out of good Nature, or the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
he might be in of continuing his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
against a Favourite who had so natural and
so great an Ascendant over him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cinqmars</hi> us'd to go every morning into the
King's Chamber, the very moment he wak'd,
and to be two hours with him there alone: But
when the King was displeas'd with him, this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
was deni'd him: and <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> lest any
one should perceive the Alteration, came every
day to the <hi>Louvre</hi> at the same time that he us'd
to do, and entred at the Door of the Wardrobe,
but instead of going directly into the King's
Chamber, he remain'd conceal'd in a little Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
that was hard by, where he diverted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with reading Romances, till the King call'd
for those Officers whose Place it was to enter.
Then the first Groom of the Chamber, who was
<hi>Cinqmars</hi> his Confident, and in his Interests, let
him in by a back Door, which was near that
Passage; so that they who came in at the other
Door finding him in the King's Chamber, and
seeing the same Appearances of Privacy,
thought his Favour likewise continued the
same.</p>
               <p>Whilst things were in this Posture, the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had several Conferences with the
Cardinal, concerning the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
finding himself sufficiently instructed, he thought,
things standing thus at Court, the best way he
could take, was to go to <hi>Turenne,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of preparing his Equipage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:50645:49"/>
He went then to St. <hi>Germains,</hi> to consult with
the Cardinal about his departure, but he found
that he was at <hi>Ruel,</hi> and that he would not be
back till Night: He resolv'd to tarry for him,
and <hi>Cinqmars</hi> having desired his Company at
Dinner, he went thither, and carried <hi>de Thou</hi>
with him.</p>
               <p>Persons of the greatest Quality often eat with
<hi>Cinqmars,</hi> even they who were most devoted to
the Cardinal, and his Relations: For <hi>Cinqmars</hi>
all along kept the Measures of Decency with this
Minister; and had several times been reconciled
to him as sincerely as Reconciliations generally
are made at Court; where after having been
very highly offended, there are Treaties still to
be made for returning into Favour.</p>
               <p>At dinner-time <hi>Cinqmars</hi> began several plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Discourses, in which there appear'd an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Gaiety. This only increas'd the
Duke and <hi>de Thou</hi>'s Suspicion, concerning his
Favour: for they thought they saw Affectation
in all he said, and much more Trouble than
Freedom of Thought: whether they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd,
or else, in truth, it is never so hard to
speak without Concern, as when one talks for
fear one's Silence should be taken notice of.</p>
               <p>After Dinner, the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
with <hi>Cinqmars</hi> and <hi>Fontrailles, Cinqmars</hi>
could not forbear speaking of his Hatred to the
Cardinal, and passing thence to the Treaty with
<hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> was not at all displeas'd
at it, because he might shew <hi>Fontrailles</hi> that he had
not chang'd his Opinion; but <hi>Fontrailles,</hi> upon
the fresh Difficulties which the Duke suggested,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50645:49"/>
took occasion to tell him, that there were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
shorter and more secure Methods against
the Cardinal, if they would make use of them.
Then <hi>Cinqmars</hi> look'd upon the Duke, who had
chang'd the Discourse, as if he had not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
what <hi>Fontrailles</hi> said. <hi>Cinqmars</hi> minded it,
and told him readily, that the other Methods, that
<hi>Fontrailles</hi> would mention, were undoubtedly,
That the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> instead of going into
<hi>Italy,</hi> would let <hi>Monsieur</hi> retreat into <hi>Sedan,</hi> and go
himself thither with him to declare War against
the Cardinal. The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> answered,
That he would keep to what he had concluded on,
and advance no farther: Besides, he told 'em That
<hi>Sedan</hi> was indeed a very good Place, but, he was
confident, that it could not hold out long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a great Army; because there were two
Posts near it, which they could not maintain;
and they being taken, the Town must undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
follow them. That when-ever they made
any account of <hi>Sedan,</hi> they must, at the same time,
consider how to gather thither an Army, that
should be able to enter <hi>France,</hi> and to hazard a
Battle there immediately. Thus the Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ended; and at Night, the Cardinal being
come from <hi>Ruel,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> went to
find him, and was told, that when he pleas'd he
might be going to <hi>Turenne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> now seeing his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be at his own Disposal; the first
Thought that came into his Mind, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Paris,</hi> to take his leave of <hi>Monsieur,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Cinqmars</hi> should have time to prepare him
to make fresh Instances, concerning <hi>Sedan,</hi> and
the Treaty with <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:50645:50"/>
The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> was scarce come to
<hi>Luxemburgh</hi>-House, where <hi>Monsieur</hi> lodg'd then,
but <hi>de Thou</hi> came to tell him, that an Account
was just come to the King, That Mareschal <hi>de
Guebriant</hi> had defeated <hi>Lamboy,</hi> the General of
the Imperial Army. This gave the Duke of
<hi>Bouillon</hi> occasion to tell <hi>Monsieur</hi> in private, that
the News could not but make him consider, that
after this Blow, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
it was easie to judge, that nothing could be
expected from them; and that Mareschal <hi>Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briant</hi>
being posted so advantageously as he was,
their Affairs would be entirely ruin'd in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
should the <hi>Hollanders</hi> never so little favour
<hi>France.</hi> To which <hi>Monsieur</hi> answered never a
Word.</p>
               <p>The same day <hi>de Thou</hi> received a Billet from
<hi>Cinqmars,</hi> which desired him to endeavour that
the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> might come and lie at St.
<hi>Germains.</hi> He shew'd it to the Duke, who told
him he had heard that <hi>Monsieur</hi> was gone thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and it was easie to guess, that this was the
Reason why <hi>Cinqmars</hi> was so pressing for his
coming; but that he could not go to take
his leave of the King, till <hi>Monsieur</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Paris;</hi> as indeed he was at that
time.</p>
               <p>When the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> came to bid the
Cardinal adieu, that which pass'd between 'em,
was, in Reality, nothing but a Repetition of what
was said the same day that the Cardinal had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to him this Employment in <hi>Italy:</hi> but he
added this Excess of Civility, That he himself
would carry him to the King to take his
leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:50645:50"/>
The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Cinqmars</hi> parted
likewise, without having any thing that was new
pass between 'em. The Duke staying two or
three days in <hi>Paris,</hi> upon his own private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
<hi>Cinqmars</hi> came to bid him once more
adieu, and renew'd to him all the Protestations
of Friendship that he had already made him.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> passing through <hi>Limo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Fontrailles</hi> came thither almost as soon as he,
and making him a Visit at the Bishop of <hi>Limoges</hi>
his Pallace, where he lodg'd, told him that he
was going to <hi>Madrid</hi> upon <hi>Monsieur</hi>'s Account,
to Treat with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that looking
upon him as the Person on whom the Weight of
all their Affairs must lie, he desir'd him, above
all things, to take care of the Preservation of his
Person. To this the Duke answered, That he
could not comprehend but that <hi>Monsieur</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
abandon'd the Design of this Treaty,
after what he had represented to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the State of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Affairs in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> since the Defeat of <hi>Lamboy:</hi> That,
for his own part, he might easily perceive that
this ill Success had not chang'd his former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spositions;
and so he desired him not to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Name upon any Account, throughout the
whole Negotiation; because he was now more
resolv'd than ever, not to enter into any Treaty
with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> during his whole Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fontrailles</hi> us'd all his Endeavours to draw
some word from him, that might not be so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory;
but his Reasons could not prevail,
the Duke still repeating the same thing.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of <hi>March, Monmort</hi> going
to <hi>Tholouse,</hi> rode Post through <hi>Turenne.</hi> He
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50645:51"/>
was a Gentleman of Quality and Merit, devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> and more his Confident than
<hi>Fontrailles</hi> himself; <hi>Cinqmars</hi> had charg'd him
to tell the Duke, That it was a thing of the
greatest Importance to them, that he should speak
with him once more, he desired him instantly to
take his Measures so, that in going into <hi>Italy,</hi> he
might meet him at <hi>Lyons,</hi> when the King should
pass that way in his Journey to <hi>Catalonia.</hi> But
on the contrary, the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> delayed
his Departure, on purpose that he might not
meet him there; not only that he might avoid
the trouble of new Proposals, but because <hi>Cinq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi>
had appointed a great number of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> his Friends, to meet him
there, which caus'd the Duke to make his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon what <hi>Fontrailles</hi> had said; That
there were more secure and expeditious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
for the ruining the Cardinal, than an
open War.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> therefore did not part
from <hi>Turenne,</hi> before he judg'd by the News he
receiv'd from Court, that it was already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
from <hi>Lyons,</hi> and so he could not meet it in
his way. The Dutchess of <hi>Bouillon</hi> bore him
Company for some days, and afterwards retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Sedan,</hi> with her Children.</p>
               <p>When the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> lay at <hi>Tarare</hi> near
<hi>Lyons, Monmort</hi> came thither Post the same
Night. <hi>Cinqmars</hi> had sent him after the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> to tell him, that the Cardinal lay
a dying: That, for himself, he had never been
so much in the King's Favour as he was at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
and so he hop'd, in a little time, the Duke
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50645:51"/>
of <hi>Bouillon</hi> would have no cause to repent his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
admitted him to such a share in his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monmort</hi> added farther, That <hi>Fontrailles</hi> was
come back from <hi>Madrid</hi> with a Treaty Sign'd in
as ample manner as <hi>Monsieur</hi> had desir'd, but in
the condition that the Cardinal was then, there
would be no need of it.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> after having answer'd
<hi>Cinqmars</hi> his Complements, desir'd <hi>Monmort</hi> to
tell him, that <hi>Monsieur</hi> was very happy that he
should be in no want of Spanish Succors, because
by a Letter that he had receiv'd from <hi>Liege,</hi> he
was better assur'd than ever, that they were not
able to spare him any that would be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal was really very sick some few
days after his departure from <hi>Lyons,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
so upon the Rode, and was carried to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rascon,</hi>
whilst the King went to the Siege of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignan:</hi>
but it was not his Illness only that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
him to stay there. The Power which <hi>Cinq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi>
had over the King, was so far increas'd,
during this Journey, that the Cardinal thought
he had reason to be much afraid of it; and if
the publick saw plainly this advance in the King's
Favour, by the exteriour marks of it: the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
saw still better by what pass'd in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of Affairs, and the manner that the
King often us'd to speak to him concerning this
Favourite: <hi>Cinqmars</hi> himself was so far from
concealing this Happiness, that he lost no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of having it took notice of.</p>
               <p>It seem'd to the Cardinal, that the King was
wholly alter'd as to him, and that the Face of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50645:52"/>
the Court chang'd likewise in favour of <hi>Cinqmars.</hi>
In short, this Minister, and his Creatures, lay
under such great uncertainties, that he had it in
deliberation, whether instead of going to the
King when his health would permit, he should
not wholly retreat and write him word, that the
occasion of his removal was, because he could no
longer have any security for himself near his
Person; <hi>Cinqmars</hi> being his declar'd Enemy, and
having engag'd almost the whole Court in his
Cabal.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the King fell sick before <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignan,</hi>
and was carried to <hi>Narbonne,</hi> where it
was infallibly believ'd he would have died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cinqmars</hi> sent a Courier to <hi>Monsieur</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with it. He was advanc'd as far as
<hi>Bourbon,</hi> under pretence of drinking the Waters,
and he had no sooner receiv'd the news of the
King's Condition; but that he sent the Count
<hi>D' Aubijeux</hi> Post away to find the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
with all Diligence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>D' Aubijoux</hi> carried only a single Credential,
and was to demand of the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> the
necessary Orders for the receiving of <hi>Monsieur,</hi>
the Queen, and her two Children into <hi>Sedan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>D' Aubijoux</hi> had contracted a very strict
Friendship with the Duke of <hi>Bouillon.</hi> He was a
Man of great Quality, of the Family of <hi>D' Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boise,</hi>
and had the reputation of much Honour
and Courage. The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> kept him
three days conceal'd in the Camp, not being
able to determine what to do, and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
they had together, the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
oftentimes repeated to him the same things
he had already told to <hi>Monsieur,</hi> when he saw
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50645:52"/>
him at <hi>Venice</hi> House, and they spoke about <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
the Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> and what was to be
done if the King should chance to die. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the more the Duke thought of it, he was the
less able to comprehend, that the Queen and
<hi>Monsieur</hi> should ever imagine, that upon the
King's Death they should be oblig'd to leave the
Kingdom: so that when he join'd these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which possest his Mind, to the memory
of what had pass'd between <hi>Mounsieur, Cinq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars,</hi>
and himself, he could scarce doubt but this
last instance about <hi>Sedan</hi> was a pure Artifice of
<hi>Cinqmars.</hi> The Pretext of providing a Retreat
for the Queen, her Children, and <hi>Monsieur,</hi> was
very plausible and glorious for the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon:</hi>
But he had all the reason in the World
to fear, lest by this Engagement he should find
himself Embarqu'd with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Civil War against his own Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>D' Aubijoux,</hi> who knew
with what impatience his return was expected,
omitted nothing that might remove the Duke's
Suspicions, and the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> did not
doubt but that if they had a design of deceiving
him, they would not have begun it with decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>D' Aubijoux:</hi> Besides, he had been several
times assur'd by <hi>D' Aubijoux,</hi> that he was too
much his Servant not to admonish him: That if
he should send him back, without agreeing to
any thing, he might be certain, <hi>Monsieur</hi> would
resent it mortally; and if the King, as it was
probable, should dye at <hi>Narbonne,</hi> it was easy to
apprehend, that in the posture things would be
then, it would be of no small consequence, to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50645:53"/>
have the Cardinal for his conceal'd Enemy, and
<hi>Monsieur</hi> for his profest one.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had resisted all these
Considerations: but at last there arriv'd an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
from Court, with Letters for him and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Officers in the Army, which all imported,
That the King's Life was despaired of.</p>
               <p>Then the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> fix'd his resolution,
and gave <hi>D' Aubijoux</hi> the Letters he demanded;
but with this precaution, that he made him
swear, they should not go out of his hands till
after the King's Death; and that if the King
should recover, he would keep 'em to give him
again, or else burn 'em, if he found any danger
like to be in preserving them.</p>
               <p>Whatever hast <hi>D' Aubijoux</hi> could make, he
found things strangely alter'd at his return. The
King was out of Danger, and the Cardinal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
his Fears and Uncertainties, had advice of
the Journey which <hi>Fontrailles</hi> had made to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid;</hi>
and waiting till he could learn more, he
in the mean time sent <hi>Chavigni,</hi> Secretary of
State, to acquaint the King with it, but gave
him express Order to engage his Majesty, upon
his Conscience, to keep the Secret. However
<hi>Cinqmars</hi> perceived some alteration in the King.
He spoke of it to <hi>Fontrailles,</hi> who advis'd him to
retire to <hi>Monsieur. Fontrailles</hi> seeing he could
not perswade him to take this Resolution, gave
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> a Challenge, that he might
have a pretence to go from Court, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
the suspicions that might arise against
<hi>Cinqmars,</hi> by his absence: after this he disguis'd
himself, and got safe into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cinqmars</hi> sent <hi>Monsieur</hi> advice how things
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50645:53"/>
stood. <hi>Monsieur</hi> desired him to come to <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>'s
at a day appointed, and that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to get out of the Kingdom by the way of
<hi>Franche-Comté.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Cardinal who set every
thing at Work, to discover the cause of <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailles</hi>'s
Journey, by some means got a Copy of
the Treaty with <hi>Spain;</hi> though no one could
ever yet learn, how he came by it, nor from
whom. The same moment he sent <hi>Chavigni</hi> to
shew it to the King, with Orders to assure his
Majesty, that this Copy was taken from the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal,
and that, upon his Life, he should have
Proofs of it. <hi>Cinqmars</hi> and <hi>de Thou</hi> were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
Arrested, and necessary Orders were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch'd
with speed for the Observation of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur.</hi>
But when he saw that he had lost the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of saving himself by the <hi>Franche-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>té,</hi>
he be thought himself of sending the Abbot
<hi>de la Riviere,</hi> who was his Favourite to the
Court. He gave him a Letter to the Cardinal,
which express'd his hearty Repentance in very
passionate Terms, and his Desire that his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
might be owing to him. The King, at the
Cardinal's Intercession, promis'd to forgive him
all, upon Condition, That <hi>Monsieur</hi> should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the Truth. In short, the Abbot <hi>de la Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viere</hi>
manag'd the business so well, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
mov'd with the Cardinal's Proceedings, and
the King's Goodness, confess'd, in general, what
had pass'd, excus'd himself for having burnt
the Original of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Treaty: gave a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of it, which he signed to certifie it, and
made it be counter-sign'd by the Secretary of his
Dispatches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:50645:54"/>
When the Cardinal had got so important a
Piece in his hands, he sent a Dispatch to <hi>Paris,</hi>
to order the Chancellour to come with all speed,
that He with the Commissaries might frame a
Process against <hi>Cinqmars</hi> and <hi>de Thou:</hi> In the
mean time they were sent to <hi>Lyons:</hi> and because
<hi>Fontrailles,</hi> to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a greater Idea
of the Party, had not omitted the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>'s
Name in the Treaty, notwithstanding all
his Praecautions; and had assured them that he
would ratifie it, and deliver <hi>Sedan</hi> for a
Place of Retreat, a Messenger was dispatch'd
with great Speed into <hi>Italy,</hi> to have him Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested.</p>
               <p>The Orders were directed to the General Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
that commanded under him, the Count
<hi>du Plessis-Praslin, Couvonges,</hi> and <hi>Castelan:</hi>
When they had all three consulted together, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Manner how they should put them in
Execution, they agreed, that they ought to defer
it till the next day, when the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>
would go to visit the Cittadel of <hi>Casal,</hi> judging
they could not, without danger, attempt to Arrest
him at the Head of the Army; so great was
the Veneration they had for him, and the Esteem
that he had gain'd among them. He had found
so extravagant a Licentiousness in the Army,
that nothing was wanting to a Revolt, but a Man
to Head 'em; and yet by his great Cares, and
the perfect Knowledge he had in the Orders of
War, he had reduc'd it, in six Weeks time, to
a most exemplary Discipline, without the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of more than two Soldiers: so that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
never any General, in so little time, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Reputation of a Great Commander, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50645:54"/>
besieging any Place, or fighting any Battle,
or having any considerable Enemy to make Head
against him.</p>
               <p>The Army was then near <hi>Casal, Couvonges</hi>
who was Governour of it went thither betimes,
to set all things in order. The Duke of <hi>Bouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
carried <hi>Castelan</hi> along with him, and left the
Count <hi>du Plessis</hi> to command in the Camp.</p>
               <p>After the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had supp'd in the
Cittadel, he went down into the Town, where
his Lodgings were prepared, and by the way
meeting with an Officer, that was just come
from the Army; he ask'd him what News from
thence? the Officer told him, he knew of none,
but that if there were any he might be inform'd
of it by the Count <hi>du Plessis,</hi> who had arriv'd
there long before him. The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>
turning himself to <hi>Couvonges,</hi> told him, that
he did not understand what the Count <hi>du Plessis</hi>
meant, by leaving the Army without his Order.
<hi>Couvonges</hi> answer'd him with much Concern,
that he had been at <hi>Casal</hi> but one Moment: and
drawing nearer, gave him in his Ear so mean an
Excuse for his coming, that the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>
began to have some Suspicions, and immediately
after retired to his Chamber, saying he would
write his Dispatches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Couvonges,</hi> who had taken notice of the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s Surprize, as the Duke had likewise
done of his, went immediately to the Count <hi>du
Plessis</hi> to tell him what had happen'd. He had
conceal'd him in a Lodging near the Duke of
<hi>Bouillon,</hi> for they had resolv'd among themselves,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50645:55"/>
not to Arrest him till he should be in Bed. The
Chance fell to <hi>Couvonges</hi> to carry him word of
it; but he had already conceiv'd so much Esteem
and Respect for the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> that he
could never bring himself to the Resolution of
Arresting him in the Cittadel, and it seem'd to
him, that by Arresting him in the Town, he
should only break the Laws of Hospitality in a
less Degree, and have fewer Difficulties in effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
a Design that could never be defended.
<hi>Couvonges</hi> having related to the Count <hi>du Plessis</hi>
and <hi>Castelan</hi> what had pass'd between the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and himself, they both judg'd that
there would be danger in deferring the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one Moment. <hi>Couvonges</hi> return'd directly to
the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s Chamber, and finding him
walking there desired a word with him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
pretending that a Spy had brought him
considerable News from the Enemy. When the
Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had order'd those about him to
retire; <hi>Couvonges</hi> began with the Compliments
that are usual upon such Occasions, that he was
extremely concern'd at the Orders he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the King to Arrest him as his Prisoner.
The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> told him, that if he had an
Order it was Counterfeited, and desired to see
it. <hi>Couvonges</hi> told him, that he had left it with
the Count <hi>du Plessis,</hi> who was not far off.
Then the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> bad him go fetch it;
and, laying his hand upon his Sword, told him,
He knew nothing that might hinder him from
running it through his Body, for having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
his Duty so little, as to dare to Arrest
such a Person as he was, without the Order for
it in his Hand. <hi>Couvonges</hi> having been concern'd
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50645:55"/>
before at his undertaking this thing, and more
troubled now at this Accident, return'd to
<hi>Praslin</hi> who was then in the Court.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> without losing time, or
making any noise, put out the Lights in his
Chamber, and got into the street by a Back-door,
there he met St. <hi>Aubin</hi> who was his Harbinger.
After having intrusted him with the Condition
he was in, he bid him follow him, took his
Cloak the better to disguise himself, and went
directly to the Rampiers, to try if they could
find a place by which they might escape: but he
judg'd it impossible, after having thrown down
stones in several places, to learn the height of
the Walls. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> offer'd to cast himself
down to make a more certain Proof of the
Danger. But the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> thought it
plain enough already, and would not consent
to it.</p>
               <p>At this time, seeing they were going the
Round, the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> retir'd back; he
stay'd among some Ruines, and sent St. <hi>Aubin</hi> to
the Town, to see what had pass'd there, and to
buy some Ropes, not despairing still, but by the
favour of the Night, he should make his Escape
over the Wall. But St. <hi>Aubin</hi> came back the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
after, and told him there were Guards at all
the Avenues, which hinder'd Folks from passing,
and that a Soldier had told him, that all the
People were in Arms, upon a Report which was
spread, That the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Casal</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Bouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
imagining, that perhaps St. <hi>Aubin</hi> might be
in greater Apprehensions than he had grounds
for, went to the Place that he saw him come
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50645:56"/>
from, and found there that not only what St.
<hi>Aubin</hi> had told him was true, but heard himself
likewise proscrib'd: for 'twas proclaim'd by the
Sound of Trumpet, That he who took him alive
or dead should receive a Thousand Pistols.</p>
               <p>In this Extremity the Duke finding himself
near a Court through which there was no Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
and seeing a Victualling-House thereabouts,
he went into it under pretence of Drinking. He
found no Body in the House but one Woman.
But the Husband, who had run out upon the
Noise in the Town, came back soon after, and
told him all he had heard concerning this Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
The Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> seeing he had nothing
else to trust to, thought of engaging this Fellow;
and because he imagin'd he should work better
upon him in his Wife's Absence, he gave her
Money to go fetch some Wine. Then he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
himself to the Husband, gave him his
Purse, in which were about Twenty or Thirty
Pieces of Gold, with a Promise to make his
Fortune. In short, the Duke had gain'd so far
upon him, that before his Wife was return'd,
St. <hi>Aubin</hi> was gone back with Orders concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what was to be done, and the Man had hid
the Duke in a Hay-loft, after he had promis'd to
effect his Escape the Night following, and that
he would say nothing of it to his Wife. But he
could not forbear imparting this Secret to her,
nor his Wife delay going to reveal it to <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonges</hi>
betimes the next Morning. <hi>Couvonges</hi>
went immediately to see if the Advice were
true, and made some Soldiers get up into the
Hay-loft. The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
discover'd, drew his Sword, and threatned
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50645:56"/>
to kill the first Man that came near him. There
was one that fir'd a Pistol at him, but it did not
go off. Then <hi>Couvonges,</hi> hearing the Bustle,
got up presently by a Rope-Ladder, and told
the Soldiers he would hang up the first
Man that should touch the Duke of <hi>Bouillon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Commotion was so great and so general
throughout <hi>Casal,</hi> by reason of the Hatred,
which they bore the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the Report,
which had been spread, That the Duke would
make 'em Masters of the Place; that, what-ever
Care they could take, yet, it was a great deal of
Trouble to secure him from the Fury of the
People, when he pass'd through the Town. But
because the Orders were to carry the Duke
immediately to the Castle of <hi>Pierre-Encise,</hi> they
put him bound into a Coach, with such a Guard,
as might shew of what Importance they judg'd
his Escape might be to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cinqmars</hi> and <hi>de Thou</hi> were already in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
when the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> came thither.
The same day they found an Opportunity of
conveighing a Billet to him, which gave him a
perfect Insight into the Posture of Affairs. For
the generality it is a great Comfort and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to a Prisoner to receive News, but the
Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> at present paid very dear for
both of them.</p>
               <p>It is impossible to express his Indignation,
when he found that <hi>Fontrailles</hi> had not only as
from <hi>Monsieur</hi> promis'd the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that
the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> would enter into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and deliver up <hi>Sedan</hi> as a Place of Retreat;
but that in the same Treaty he had requested,
and obtain'd a Pension for him. We may guess
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50645:57"/>
likewise what Addition it was to his Trouble,
to find that <hi>Monsieur</hi> having given a Copy of
the Treaty in Form, had not mentioned in the
Declaration he had join'd to it, what the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were, upon which, and no other, the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had promis'd to receive him into <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;</hi>
for this Point was not clear'd, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Monsieur</hi> durst not disavow what <hi>Fontrailles</hi>
had done in his Name, in a Treaty now made
publick; or that it was too great a Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to shew the King what Projects he had laid
upon his Death, and to let the Cardinal see, how
much he was afraid of him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Chancellour, with great
diligence, had given Instructions for the Process
against <hi>Cinqmars</hi> and <hi>de Thou,</hi> who were both
condemn'd to be beheaded; one, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of a Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> the other, for
knowing and yet not revealing it.</p>
               <p>It is not possible for a Man to go to his Death,
with more Courage, or greater marks of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Piety, than both of them demonstrated.
<hi>Cinqmars,</hi> being ready to mount the Scaffold,
wrote to his Mother, to desire her, to pay some
of his Creditours; and shew'd in the Letter
both the Tranquillity of his Mind, and the Care
he had of his Conscience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>De Thou,</hi> being better read in Divinity, made
admirable Discourses upon the Psalms and New
Testament. There appear'd in all his Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
a lively Faith, and an entire Resignation
as to things of this World: yet, in short,
though in this last Action of their Lives, they
both of 'em gave equal Demonstrations of their
Constancy, yet it is hard, considering the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50645:57"/>
of their Age and Fortune, not to be
so favourable to <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> as to allow him some
larger Proportion of the Glory.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> having but a small
Knowledge in the Laws of the Kingdom, was
perswaded, that he had acted only like a Man of
Honour, in not revealing his Friends Secret, and
it was sufficient to excuse him from any Guilt of
Treason, That he had never given any Powers,
nor signed any Treaty that was made with <hi>Spain.</hi>
But when he heard of <hi>de Thou</hi>'s Condemnation,
he doubted not of his own Ruine, and for three
days, that he continued without receiving any
News, he did nothing but prepare himself for
Death. However no Sentence was pronounc'd
against him, either for want of Proofs, or
through the Instances made by the Viscount <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
his Brother, who was very Considerable,
and grew daily more so, by his extraordinary
Actions and signal Services.</p>
               <p>But that which contributed more effectually
than any thing to the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s Safety,
was, That as soon as ever his Dutchess had the
News of his Seizure, she dispatched her Sister-in-Law,
<hi>Madamoiselle de Bouillon,</hi> who was a
Princess of great Parts, and capable of Business,
immediately away to Court. She ordered her
to tell the Cardinal from Her, That, if he put
her Husband to death, she would deliver <hi>Sedan</hi>
to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that he need not doubt it,
since she had already sent to 'em to come thither.
But when <hi>Madamoiselle de Bouillon</hi> saw <hi>de Thou</hi>
executed, she went back to the Cardinal, to tell
him, she had full Power to negotiate with him,
and to engage in any thing for the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>'s
Life and Liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:50645:58"/>
At last the Treaty was concluded on. It was
Agreed, That the King should have <hi>Sedan,</hi> and
that he should give the Duke an Aequivalent in
Lands within the Kingdom; That, whilst these
Articles were in Execution, the Duke of <hi>Bouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
should come out of Prison, and the King's
Troops enter into <hi>Sedan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mazarine,</hi> one of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
was sent thither to take Possession for the
King, and to give all necessary Securities: The
Dutchess of <hi>Bouillon</hi> being likewise perswaded,
That both her Husband's Life and Liberty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon the rendring up of <hi>Sedan,</hi> parted
with it as willingly as she would have receiv'd a
considerable Favour, and went to <hi>Turenne,</hi> to meet
the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who was retired thither.</p>

               <head>THE
Third BOOK.</head>
               <p>THE Year before, The Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
arriv'd at <hi>Turenne,</hi> after having
gain'd a Victory, and making so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
a Peace, that his Glory
had spread it self throughout all <hi>Europe:</hi> but
now he came just out of a Prison, where he had
been in great danger of his Life, depriv'd like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of the Sovereignty of one of the best places
in the World. This unhappy State which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him no farther now considerable than his
own Personal Merit could make him, yet did not
hinder the Nobility of the Neighbouring Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from coming in large Companies to visit
him: and since they expected to find his thoughts
in a posture conformable to his Affairs, they
could not but admire to see no manner of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in so different a Fortune.</p>
               <p>He convers'd with every one as he used to do
before, agreeably to their humour, and the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of their Persons: But he never enter'd upon
any Apology for what had pass'd, nor any insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of the hopes he might conceive for the
future. As for the rest of his time he took ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Cognizance of his Revenue, and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Estate; he enquir'd into the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50645:59"/>
of his Servants. In several places he set
up Fathers to preach against the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which most of the Inhabitants thereabouts
profest: and he himself enter'd so far into the
Controversy, as to dispute with divers Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
some of which recanted afterwards: and
in their private Affairs, he decided several Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and reconciled as many differences. He
spent everyday a set number of hours in reading,
and particularly in the perusal of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
He often hunted as well for Exercise as
Diversion. He made very few Visits, because tho'
Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> look'd upon him as a Prince
that was fallen beyond retrieve; yet he could
not but have regard to him as an Enemy that
would be ready for any undertaking, when a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
opportunity should present it self, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for his Revenge, or the Reestablishment of
his Affairs. Besides, he had notice that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
and Governours of the Neighbouring
Provinces had Orders to observe him. So he
look'd upon <hi>Turenne,</hi> and his other Seats, as
the places of his Exile. But by comporting
himself after the manner I have spoke of, it is
easie to judge that he was not dejected at it, and
that it only encreased the esteem they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
conceived of him. So true a thing it is, That
when Fortune has reduced Great Men to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Life, they are able to employ themselves so
well as to maintain their Bravery and their
Glory.</p>
               <p>Five or six Months after his continuance at
<hi>Turenne,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> died at <hi>Paris.</hi> The
very moment that the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> received
the News, he ordered Prayers to be said for
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50645:59"/>
him in the Places that belong'd to him; either
out of the pure Motive of Christian Charity;
or else because a Personal Hatred makes so little
Impression upon Men of great Souls, that they
cannot carry it to the Graves of their most mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Enemies.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> did not change his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
upon the Death of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> but
the Death of the King, which happened four or
five Months after, made him take up new Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.
Seeing the Queen was declared Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and <hi>Monsieur</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the Council; the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had
Reason to believe, and all <hi>France</hi> thought the
same, That he could never expect a more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Conjuncture. He therefore went for <hi>Paris.</hi>
He was very kindly receiv'd by the Queen and
<hi>Monsieur</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the whole
Court look'd upon him as a Person that could not
fail of re-entring <hi>Sedan,</hi> and becoming more
considerable now than ever. In the mean time,
he perceived, by degrees, that their way of
Treating him began to be much cooler than at
first; and the Silence, as to his Affairs, which
accompanied this Change, began to let him appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
that if they had not intirely forgot the Los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
he had sustain'd, and the Dangers he had run
through, yet at least that Remembrance of them
which remain'd, serv'd rather to make his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
seem importunate, than to inspire any
Sentiments that might be to his Advantage.
There could be no Addition to the Grief he
conceiv'd at seeiug himself in so different a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
from what he might reasonably have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected:
but he thought it Prudence to dissemble
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50645:60"/>
the Knowledge he had of this Misfortune,
and, in the mean time, that he might be
certain what to rely upon, he judg'd it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to demand an Audience of the Queen
and <hi>Monsieur.</hi> They both promis'd him one.
But after having waited several days, to have a
time assign'd him, they remitted him, at last, to
the Abbot <hi>de la Riviere,</hi> whom they ordered
to go and conferr with him, concerning his
Pretensions.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> declared to him, That
he was willing to execute the Treaty, as to the
Exchange of <hi>Sedan.</hi> But it being impossible that
the Valuations that were to be made, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations,
and several other Formalities, that
were absolutely necessary, should be finished un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
several Years, he desired, that, in the mean
time, they would put him in Possession of the
Place. Not that he had any design of keeping
it; but, on the contrary, would, without any
trouble, restore it into the King's hands the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
moment that his Aequivalent was ready. That
if it were so at present, he would make no Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in receiving it: But he foresaw Delays and
infinite Disputes would arise if they should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in this Affair, without having first deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him <hi>Sedan;</hi> because then they would treat of
it as a Business that regarded him only: whereas
if they saw him re-establish'd, they would look
upon it as the King's Concern, for the extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Frontiers by the Acquisition of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty,
and a Place so very strong, and so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
important. That if none of those Reasons
would move the Queen and <hi>Monsieur,</hi> he thought
it his Duty to take the Liberty of representing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50645:60"/>
to them, That both of them might die before
things might be in a Condition of being settled;
that then the Loss to his Family would be inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
and that after all that had happened here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
they were bound both in Honour and
Conscience, not to let him be expos'd to this ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Misfortune. He added farther; That her
Majesty and his Royal Highness were the two
People in the World that had least Reason to
distrust him; nevertheless, to shew the Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with which he would proceed, he offered to
give them what-ever Praecautions they desired,
even to the Delivery of his Children for Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>The Abbot <hi>de la Riviere</hi> answered the Duke of
<hi>Bouillon</hi> with abundance of Compliments. But he
told him, that having no farther Orders than to
hear him, all that he could do was only to assure
him, that he would report faithfully what-ever
had been spoken, and it should not be his
Fault, if he had not a favourable and a speedy
Answer.</p>
               <p>The Abbot <hi>de la Riviere</hi> as being <hi>Monsieur</hi>'s
declared Favourite, had for a long time had a
great part in the most important Affairs of
State, especially during the Regency. He was
born at <hi>Paris,</hi> of a poor and mean Family. He
was a Scholar: He had Wit, and made an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Use of it, in every thing that might serve
for his Master's Diversion. This was the chief
Foundation upon which he rais'd himself. But
after having been the Servant and Comptroller
of his Master's Pleasures, he became so likewise
of his Affairs and Fortune. He was a Courtier
that studied his own Interest, rough and passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50645:61"/>
at home, complaisant and submissive to all
that were above him, but rude and insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to all the World beside.</p>
               <p>During the Minority he was nam'd for a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal.
In the mean time, <hi>Monsieur</hi> perceived
that he discover'd his Secrets to hasten his own
Promotion at <hi>Rome,</hi> and advance his Fortune at
Court. Then <hi>Monsieur</hi> abandon'd him for ever;
but this Disgrace did not hinder him from dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bishop and Duke of <hi>Langres,</hi> and in great
Wealth; yet condemned of all Men for having
pass'd his Life without the gaining of one Friend,
and still more blameable, for never seeing any of
his Relations from the first Advancement of his
Fortunes.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> waited several days for
an Answer to the Conference he had with the
Abbot <hi>de la Riviere,</hi> and seeing that sometimes
upon one Pretence, and sometimes another, he
deferr'd the giving him any, he thought it his
best way to address himself directly to the Queen
and <hi>Monsieur.</hi> But they avoided speaking with
him, and that with such an Aire, as plainly
shew'd him that they did not like his Proposals.
Then he return'd to the Abbot <hi>de la Riviere,</hi>
to inform him farther concerning his Pretensions.
After having enquired for him several times in
vain, the Duke happen'd one day to be in his
Anti-Chamber, when several Persons of Quality
were coming from him; he ask'd likewise to see
him, but a <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> came to tell him in
their Presence, that he was gone abroad. This
Usage put the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> out of all Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
He could not refrain being in a Fury, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50645:61"/>
telling the <hi>Valet</hi> aloud, that if it were not out
of Respect to <hi>Monsieur,</hi> he would treat his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
after such a manner, that he should have
Cause to remember so base a Proceeding as long
as he liv'd. This Encounter was nois'd abroad
the same day: and since Services which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Reward, often produce as dangerous Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
as Injuries; The Queen and <hi>Monsieur</hi> took
this Pretence of ridding themselves of the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and his Pretensions. They propos'd
to the Council to have him Arrested. He was
advis'd of it, and, without taking leave, went
Post to <hi>Turenne.</hi>

            <head>Some PARTICULARS
Concerning the
LIFE
OF
HENRY de la Tour d' Auvergne,
Viscount TURENNE.</head>
            <p>I Don't pretend to give you here the Life of
the Viscount <hi>Turenne.</hi> I wish, for his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that there might be found a Man more
daring than my self, and who had Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
equal to a Design so vast, and withal so
difficult, by reason of the Greatness of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
But though no Person would undertake it,
yet there is no need to fear, that the Memory of
his Glorious Actions would be ever lost. It is
impossible without Writing his History, to give
an Account of what pass'd in <hi>France</hi> for forty
Years together. However since I had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
for several Years, to be engag'd with him
in Affairs of the greatest, as well as smallest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence;
and that it often happens to <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:50645:63"/>
to be ignorant of, or else to neglect some
Essential Particulars; I shall endeavour by some
Historical as well as private Proceedings, to
leave Posterity a True Idea of so great a Man.
What I shall say in Honour of his Memory, will
deserve the greater Credit, because I am so far
from being render'd suspicious by the Favours
he has done me, that he has ruin'd my Fortune
beyond Retrieve: However I owe Him this
Justice, to confess he did it without any Design
of Injuring me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry de la Tour d' Auvergne,</hi> Viscount <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi>
was of a mean Stature. He was neither
fat nor lean. In his Gate and Behaviour there
appear'd less of Boldness, than Modesty and
Caution. His Hair was brown, his Head big,
and bowing a little forwards: his Complexion
ruddy; his Eyes large and sprightly, but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with great Eye-brows that met both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
His Face was regular enough; and
yet there was a pleasant Air join'd to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was cloudy in it; which Mixture
made a Physiognomy that was extraordinary,
and very difficult to be painted.</p>
            <p>In his Childhood he was of a tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion;
nor had he his Health well, till after
he was Twenty. He was not above Nine or
Ten years old, when, having stoln from his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
and being sought for a long time, he
was found upon the Rampiers of <hi>Sedan,</hi> laid
down to sleep upon the Carriage of a Cannon,
being resolv'd to pass the Night there. He had
heard his Father the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> often say,
That it would be a great while before he would
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50645:63"/>
be able to endure the Fatigues of War: and the
Young Prince thought this was a Proof suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to undeceive him. He began his first
Service in <hi>Holland</hi> under the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
his Uncle, and was sent thither when he was
but fourteen Years old.</p>
            <p>He had naturally an extraordinary Inclination
to War, which being very much heighten'd by
the Desire of Glory, He apply'd himself so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
to that Art, that in his Childhood he
seemed to be truly sensible of no other Passion.
He acquired a great Reputation in a little time,
and being in War all his Life, and living till 63.
he at last, in all Mens Opinion, seem'd fit to be
compared to the greatest Generals among the
Ancients. He was born with a great deal of
'Spirit, but was less Remarkable for a Quick and
Easie Wit, than for a Profound Judgment: In
Matters that were pressing, and of Consequence,
he determined without Suspence, and continued
firm and faithful to the Side which he had taken;
but he was better at foreseeing the End propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
than in providing for the different Means by
which it was attainable.</p>
            <p>He passed his Life without any Personal Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
however in the beginning he did not always
serve under Persons for whom he had much E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem;
several likewise serv'd under him, that
had no greater Value for him: and he was join'd
in Command with others, whose Humour and
Manners were very inconsistent with his own;
and the more so, by reason of the Emulation
and Jealousie which they had of his Glory: for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50645:64"/>
besides that he gave no Credit to Reports, and
that he despised such things as were spoke
against him, He was always intent upon some
great Design, and troubled himself with very
few things that were not a real Obstacle
to it.</p>
            <p>He was never tempted by the Assurance of a
present Success to any Enterprize that might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his own Glory, when he thought it would
interrupt the Course of a Design, greater and
more useful for the State, though at a farther
distance: and naturally he was so set upon the
Publick Good, that, to promote it, he often
sacrific'd his Private Fortune, and sometimes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded
his own Reputation.</p>
            <p>He was so far from throwing the Blame of ill
Accidents upon those Officers he employ'd, that
he never lost any Occasion of encouraging them,
when they happened to have met with ill Fortune.
Amongst so many Subjects for his Anger and
Displeasure, which he must have met withal
from the Time he began to be a Commander.
He never offended any Body; he was never
heard to speak one passionate Word to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
and though he was naturally mild and
patient, yet a Vertue so rare, and practised with
so much Constancy, could not have been the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of his Temper only.</p>
            <p>One day when he was preparing to mark out
the Lines of a Place which was to be besieged,
he found that he wanted some necessary Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and remembring that a Mareschal of
<hi>France,</hi> who commanded one of the Attacks,
had more than he used, he sent one of his
Guards to borrow some of him. The Soldier
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50645:64"/>
came back very much troubled, and repeated
aloud several disagreeable things which the
Mareschal said when he refused to lend them.
The Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi> turning to the Officers
near him, <hi>Since he is so angry,</hi> (says he) <hi>we must
e'en let them alone, and do as well as we can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them.</hi> After this he attack'd the Lines,
forced them, and gained all the Glory of the
Action.</p>
            <p>At this last Campagne in <hi>Flanders,</hi> several
Courtiers came from the Army very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd
against him, but without any reasonable
Ground. The Viscount <hi>Turenne,</hi> who did not
return till a Month after the King, found that
from their private Discontent, they had raised
One so general, that there was scarce any Body
in the whole Court who did not do himself the
Honour of speaking ill, or complaining of him.
Several of the Cabal, and some of the first Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
spoke to him to accommodate Matters,
and to clear things with him. All his Answer
was, That he would not be at that trouble. It
was enough for him to be assured that he had
given no Person Reason to complain: that he
did not despair but upon some other occasion,
where perhaps he might be really to blame, the
Gentlemen of the Court would be favourable to
him. Afterwards they all came back upon their
own accord, as if nothing had passed, and he
acted with them as if he had heard nothing
of it.</p>
            <p>He was incapable of Hatred, but very sensible
of Friendship; he was seen to shed Tears in the
Steets of <hi>Pontoise,</hi> upon the News he receiv'd at
the Gate of the Town, That the Duke of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:50645:65"/>
his Brother lay there dangerously sick of the
Disease whereof he died: and his Tears were so
much the more natural and moving, because it
was easily seen that he had a Mind to refrain
them. He spoke generally of his Brother with
so much Modesty and Heartiness, that discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with a Friend two or three days after the
Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s Death, he said these very
Words to him; <hi>It is believed that I know something
of War, but there is nothing truer than I might
still have learn'd a great deal more from the Duke
my Brother; and then for Business, How far was
his Talent beyond mine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was not always happy in the Choice of his
Friends; however he bewailed the Death of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of them: and his natural Goodness was so
great, that he was never hardened by all the
Blood he had seen spilt. Nor could he hinder
himself from having always in his Mind the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Promoting some Person or other, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
so much Ingratitude as he had met
with.</p>
            <p>For several Years he had no good Success in
War, nay, he was look'd upon as unfortunate;
however in those Encounters wherein he did not
succeed, Fame has always done Justice to his
Courage and Conduct, and he has often acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
more Glory, than those who had gained the
Advantage over him. He had a very great Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
which the Conjuncture of the Times,
and his own Prudence, made him, for the most
part, moderate, or else conceal: but if he had
lived in some past Ages, that have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to Conquerours, though he would
have set no Bounds to his own Glory,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50645:65"/>
yet he easily would have done it to his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
            <p>During the Regency in the Year 1649. <hi>Paris</hi>
took Arms to drive out the Cardinal <hi>Mazarine;</hi>
the Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi> (either by the Fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation
which reigned then, or through the
Discontent he had conceived at that Minister, in
regard of his private Fortune, and that of his
Family) took a Resolution contrary to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the Cardinal, but which he did not
look upon as against the publick Good of the
Kingdom. He commanded the Army in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
which consisted of between 12 and 15000
Men, most Strangers; they had a very great
Veneration for him, which was owing not only
to his Merit, but to his Impartiality, and way
of Living amongst his Officers; besides the
greatest part of them were beholden to him
for their Advancement, having scarce any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
at Court but through his Means.
In short, the Soldiers being intirely devoted to
him, the Principal Officers of the Army, who
were absolutely his, engag'd all the others to
swear, That they would follow no other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>This Engagement was published with the
Sound of Drums and Trumpets, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
of the Soldiers; so that never upon
the Change of any Party was there seen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
so general a Consent, and the Testimonies
of so firm a Dependance. He declared to the
<hi>French</hi> and others, who would not enter into his
Interest, that he left them Liberty to retire;
which very few did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:50645:66"/>
They marched the next day to enter into
<hi>France;</hi> but upon the third day after, the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Turenne</hi> being come to <hi>Spire,</hi> to make
a Bridge for the Army to pass over, <hi>Longpr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
Lieutenant-Colonel of the Regiment of Foot,
of <hi>Vaudecourt,</hi> came in hast to tell him, That
<hi>Thoubal</hi> and <hi>Chust,</hi> two General Officers, that
were Strangers, who ow'd all to the Viscount <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi>
and in whom he had placed his principal
Confidence, had pass'd the Night in treating
with <hi>Hervard,</hi> sent by Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who
carried likewise Orders from the Queen, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Letters from the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to the
Officers of the Army; so that being gain'd by
large Hopes and great Summs of Money (which
<hi>Hervard</hi> advanced upon his Credit, to about
12 or 1300000 Livres) they made all the Army
change their Minds, so that they were already
marching another way.</p>
            <p>This Resolution was so quick and universal,
that the same Troops, which a few days before
had shew'd so great a Zeal for the Viscount <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi>
had infallibly seized him Prisoner, if
without losing any time, he had not made his
Escape: And this was the first time that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
how little Security there is for the Life
and Fortune of Men, when they ground it only
upon a Power which is usurped. In the mean
time, as it was impossible so extraordinary an
Encounter should not have suitable Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the Viscount <hi>Turenne,</hi> the Campagne fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
was at the Head of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Army,
to procure the Deliverance of the Princes of
<hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Conti,</hi> and fought the Battel of <hi>Rethel</hi>
He lost it, and when he saw himself out of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50645:66"/>
to think of any thing but the Safety of his
own Person; he got apart from those that were
flying, mounted upon a wounded Horse, and
was followed only by <hi>la Barge,</hi> Lieutenant of
his Guards, whose Horse was wounded likewise;
after a little time they saw Five Troopers riding
full speed up to them; <hi>la Barge</hi> told the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Turenne, I have but one Pistol to discharge,
and you have fir'd all yours; Sir, What will you do?
Die</hi> (says he) la Barge, <hi>rather than return into</hi>
France <hi>to serve for a Spectacle.</hi> Then they
were set upon by two of these Troopers, who
advanced before the rest; <hi>la Barge</hi> went to one
and killed him with his Pistol; the other coming
up to the Viscount <hi>Turenne,</hi> took him by the
Belt, and offer'd him Quarter, the Viscount <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
killed him with a Blow of his Sword; Of
the three that remain'd, one who seemed to be
an Officer shot a Pistol at Viscount <hi>Turenne,</hi> and
miss'd him: afterwards they all three retired
without attempting any farther; either that
they were frightened by the Death of their
Companions, or that the Destiny of <hi>France</hi>
would reserve this Prince for the several Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
it expected from him. In Effect the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Turenne</hi> had been lost without Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
his own Horse and <hi>la Barge</hi>'s being no longer
able to go: but <hi>la Vaux,</hi> an Officer in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Blereau,</hi> pass'd by at that Instant, and
gave his to him to make an Escape. After these
two Actions, which he never recollected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Grief and Repentance; Posterity cannot
but wonder that he should be the next Year at
the Head of one of the King's Armies, and that
they should place an entire Confidence in him.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50645:67"/>
But though there be no Example of an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so quick and great, I leave it to History to
shew in the several Particulars, how much, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole Remainder of his Life, he shewed
himself worthy of it, by his inviolable Fidelity,
and extraordinary Services.</p>
            <p>He began to repair the Misfortunes which had
befallen him in the two preceding Years, by
two Actions which he did in the space of 12 or
15 days; one at <hi>Gergeau,</hi> the other at <hi>Blereau:</hi>
and because I was there to see them, and that
both times he sav'd the Estate and Person of the
King, I cannot forbear relating them.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi> had received
necessary Orders for the Command of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
he parted from <hi>Blois</hi> where the Court was
then, and advanced by the way of <hi>Sully</hi> and <hi>Gien,</hi>
to assemble the Troops which were to serve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him. The King went not yet to the War,
nor did intermeddle with Affairs, because he
was so very young, and the <hi>Queen-Mother</hi> repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Government of the State entirely in
Cardinal <hi>Mazarine.</hi> Some days after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of Viscount <hi>Turenne,</hi> the King went
likewise from <hi>Blois</hi> to go to <hi>Orleans;</hi> but that
City had shut it's Gates against him, so he took
a Resolution of going to <hi>Gien.</hi> At the time
they were passing, without any Praecaution, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Walls of <hi>Gergeau,</hi> a little Town upon
the River <hi>Loire,</hi> the Baron <hi>de Syrop,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Army of the <hi>Princes,</hi> attack'd the
Bridge of <hi>Gergeau,</hi> with a Design to pass it, and so
to fall upon the Court in its March; he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
become Master of the Gate which is on
the other side of the River, and was making a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50645:67"/>
Lodgment about the Middle of the Bridge,
whilst he raised a Battery of two Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
to beat down the other. The Viscount <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi>
who was advanced to cover the King,
hearing the Noise of the Musquets, left the
Road, and threw himself into <hi>Gergeau.</hi> He
found there some Foot, but so ill provided of
Ammunition, that the greatest part of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
had never a Charge of Powder. Seeing
the Affair to be of such Importance, he made
the Gate be opened, and the Draw-Bridge be
let down, and, that the Enemy might hear
him, he commanded the Foot which guarded the
Curtain, that, upon Pain of Death, no Man
should fire without his Order; afterwards
having made all those that were with him to
alight from their Horses, himself at their Head,
he went with his Sword drawn up to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
chased them from the Lodgment they had
made upon the Bridge, and, notwithstanding all
their Efforts and their Cannon, which killed or
wounded 8 or 10 Persons who were near him, he
drove them to the other side of the River, and
afterwards broke down two Arches of the
Bridge, that he might leave the Court in perfect
Security.</p>
            <p>The King arrived at <hi>Gien,</hi> the Viscount <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
marched thence to post himself at <hi>Briare</hi>
with the Troops he had gathered: and having
learn'd that the Marquess <hi>d' Hoquincourt,</hi> who
came to join him with a considerable Body, was
about <hi>Blereau;</hi> He went to confer with him,
and visit his Camp.</p>
            <p>The Mareschal <hi>d' Hoquincourt</hi> had a great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Courage. He was capable of undertaking
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50645:68"/>
any thing, and venturing all: but he very often
did not use all the care and precaution that might
be necessary.</p>
            <p>After they had been both to see the Marshal's
Quarters, the Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi> told him several
times, that he found he lay very open, and
that he would advise him to retire by the way
of <hi>Briare.</hi> He answer'd still, that he had nothing
to fear, and that a good Guard would secure all.
In the mean time the Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi> was no
sooner upon his return to <hi>Briare,</hi> but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal
was attack'd. The Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi> having
notice, advis'd the Court of it, and march'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to him with the Troops he had at <hi>Briare,</hi>
and thereabouts. He sent Orders to those that
were at farther distance, to advance immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
by the way which goes from <hi>Briare</hi> to <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeau,</hi>
and order'd all the Artillery to march thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Half a League from <hi>Briare,</hi> he learnt by
some who were run away, that the Marshal <hi>D'
Hoquincourt</hi> was entirely routed. The News
was soon after confirmed by a Prisoner, who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
him, that the Enemy were coming to him,
and that he had left them upon their march: all
the General Officers were of Opinion, that they
should go to the Kings Person, as being the only
advice could be taken in this Extremity, and
with a force so very unequal; but the Viscount
<hi>Turenne,</hi> with a vigour of Mind proportionable
to the Danger and Importance of the Affairs,
scarce staying to Answer them, gave necessary
Orders, marched on, and pressed the Troops to
redouble their Diligence. <hi>La Berge</hi> came up to
tell him, that every Body murmured, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
all to be lost, if he did not return to the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50645:68"/>
Kings Person. The Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi> Answered
him, <hi>That this was a pleasant thing to have recourse
to, when</hi> Orleans <hi>had set such an Example, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had received any shock; where will they open
their Gates when we shall present our selves Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht,
Flying and Conquered? we must perish or
save all.</hi> The day before, as he returned from
Monsieur <hi>D' Hoquincourt</hi>'s Quarters, he saw a
Marsh, which made a long Defile: the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of this Marsh came then into his Mind,
he judg'd by the Reflections which he made on
the situation of the Places, that before the Enemy
could come to him, they were oblig'd to pass
by it. In this Opinion he marched on, and came
there so luckily, that he was on one side of the
Marsh, at the same time that the Enemies Troops
began to appear on the other; he had not then
above 3500. Men: however he stopt a Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Army consisting of 13, or 14000. and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court was already much Alarm'd at the
Defeat of Marshal <hi>d' Hoquincourt,</hi> but they were
extreamly frightened when they heard of the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Turenne</hi>'s march. For they doubted not but
he would fall into the same Misfortune. In this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
they thought the only Refuge was to get
the River <hi>Loire</hi> between the King and his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
the greatest part of the Equipage was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
past: they began to Unfurnish the Queens
Apartment, and the Pioneers were ready to
break down the Arches of the Bridge, when they
heard Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi>'s great Success, and were
assur'd, that after having seen the Enemy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
to their Quarters, he was come back to
Post himself at <hi>Briare</hi> with his Army.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:50645:69"/>
The same Day Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> wrote to
him to have his Advice, as to the relation he
would send with all speed to <hi>Paris,</hi> and into the
Country, to prevent such reports as might be
spread there to their disadvantage. This Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
began with the Counsel which the Viscount
<hi>Turenne</hi> had given the day before to the Marshal
to Retreat by the way of <hi>Briare.</hi> The Viscount
<hi>Turenne</hi> struck out this Article, saying, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal
was unfortunate enough, without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so disobliging a Circumstance.</p>
            <p>He us'd very few words upon all occasions. He
was uneasy under all long Discourses, and unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
particulars; his great Application sometimes
seem'd to confound him, so that the Reasons
he often gave were very obscure; his profound
thoughtfulness made him often ask Questions out
of the way, and pronounce Sentences which had
no Connection; he often times took up Aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which he did not easily lay down, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
rather to the Air and Carriage of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
than to the People themselves. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
were a Man never so Brave, yet he
could not endure that he should use any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
for his defence against the weather.
As for those that he perfectly despised, let them
be of whatsoever quality they would, yet it was
with extream regret, that he could bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to speak to them, and to keep such decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
with them as might be necessary; and the
most assured means of incurring his contempt,
was to be Vainglorious, and commend ones self.
He was very unwilling People should look upon
him as a Person prejudiced, or distrustful: and
whether it was to cover his own faults, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50645:69"/>
a Man's Mind has necessarily opposite Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
he would frequently discover such Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
as he should have concealed, and would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
just, sincere and open, at the expence even
of his Relations and his Friends.</p>
            <p>The uneasiness he conceived at seeing that Men
were perswaded he was soon prejudiced by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
and Esteem, had so much Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Mind, that though he was inclined always
to prefer his Friends, to such favours as depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon himself, and to assist them with his
Fortune, or engage himself for them; yet he
always spoke with less force and boldness upon
their account, than in behalf of such Persons who
were known to be indifferent to, or suspected by
him. Carried either by motives of Justice, or
else in respect only of the Glory and Advantage
of his Prince, he often did very good Offices,
and procured Imployment for those who did not
love him; so that some may have rejoiced at
his Death, who perhaps without their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
owe the places they possess at present, to
his Recommendations.</p>
            <p>He always loved his own Family, but in the
beginning he had less considerations for it than
his own Preferment, and afterwards neither
that, nor his Family could stand in Competition
with his Glory.</p>
            <p>In all Encounters he relieved his Relations,
even beyond his Ability, and parted with some
of his Inheritance in favour of them, being more
touched with their necessities than his own
wants.</p>
            <p>He never boasted of what he had given, and
made his Presents with a modesty very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50645:70"/>
and such as is necessary to moderate that
Pride and Vanity which for the most part attend
Mens Bounty: This Vertue which is not usual
in old Age, was so natural to him, that even in
latter years he bestow'd his money more liberally
than ever. In short, under a Prince generous
and Magnificent, in an Age so proper to raise
great Fortunes, he died with much less Estate
than he had received from his own Family.</p>
            <p>One day when some of his Friends were talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him concerning Riches, Rallying and
making comparisons on this Subject, he told
them that it was true that he could never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the pleasure of keeping Chests full of
Gold and Silver; that for himself, if at the years
end he had any considerable sums remaining, he
should be as uneasy, as if upon his return from
a Feast, he should have greater served up to him.
Being in the County of <hi>Marck</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> Count
<hi>Conismar</hi> Marshal <hi>de Conyre,</hi> proposed to him a
way of gaining 100000. Crowns in fifteen days,
by means of Contributions: he answered smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
that he was much obliged to him, but
after having met with several such occasions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
without making any advantage of them,
he could not bring himself to alter his Conduct
at that Age.</p>
            <p>All the care that he took of his own Person,
was only to avoid being a Sloven, the rest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on his Attendants, not requiring from
them, either in his Personal Service, or the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of his House, any Care or Diligence; so
that at Court as well as in the Army, one might
often come into his Chamber without finding
any Domestick, to whom you might apply your
self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:50645:70"/>
He looked over his Concerns always in gross,
but seldom entred into Particulars; and he was
troubled that People took notice, that this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of his encreased, as Affairs multiplied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. He spoke generally with a loud Voice,
clear and strong; but when he told any Secret,
though of the least Consequence, he thought he
could never speak low enough; and the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Men had conceived of his Distrustful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
was so well grounded, that he seldom
could be reconciled to himself for having made
a Confident. He was indefatigable both in Mind
and Body; his Health, after he was 40, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
interrupted but by one Fever of 8 or 10
days continuance, and by some small Fits of the
Gout a little before his Death.</p>
            <p>In Affairs of Consequence, whether easie or
difficult, he still acted with the same Vigilance,
never presuming on, or despairing of Success;
yet more ready always to take superfluous Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions,
than omit any that were necessary. He
never spared his own Labour, though he did
that of other Men, as much as the Service in
hand would permit him. He had always great
Designs; and all his Projects of War were foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon extraordinary Prudence, and a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
that looked very far. But when by Chance
and the Necessity of things, he was obliged to
commit himself to Fortune, he gave himself up
to it with all the Gaiety and Boldness of a
young Soldier. Those that serv'd under him
never knew of his Designs till the very moment
they were to Act them. He was more able
than any Man in the World to ruine an Enemy's
Army, though much inferiour to it; and to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50645:71"/>
conclude a Campagne with Advantage, though
there was all the Reason in the World to be
afraid of its Success.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the day of a great Battle,
there was nothing extraordinary to be remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in him: but in such proportion as the Affair
proceeded and became more difficult, you might
see him as it were exalted, and providing for
every thing with a Freedom of Mind, and Stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
of Conduct, which few Men are Masters
of in Dangers of long Continuance. However
he was timerous at Court, and in his Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and no very expert Manager of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Concerns. There was likewise a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Change to be seen in his Air and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:
the moment that he came into an Army,
he charmed every Body by a way of living gay
and easie. He never shut himself up for Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
his Doors being always open; nor was
there any Mark of Ostentation or Pride in his
Words or Actions: but when he was reduced
by Peace to a Private Life, that Suspension of
true Glory which he always found in War, left
some place in his Heart for the movements of
another Glory not so real, which rendered his
Access more difficult, even to his best Friends.</p>
            <p>The Power of a Favourite made some Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
on his Mind; but whether retained by his
own Glory, or Fear of what might follow, he
always preferr'd his Liberty to the Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which might advance his Fortune: and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
keeping such Measures as were agreeable
to the Posts that Men were in. He pass'd the
most difficult Times without any particular Tye
or Engagement. He stood upon his own Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50645:71"/>
and spoke with the Liberty and Boldness
of an honest Man, when-ever he thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to his own Glory or his Master's Service.</p>
            <p>After he had gained the Battle of <hi>Dules,</hi> and
taken <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the Cardidal <hi>Mazarine</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
desired that he might attribute the
Glory of these two great Actions to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
he would have had the Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi>
to write him a Letter, which should, in effect,
declare, that they were owing to him alone,
who had thought of, and projected all things in
his Closet, and they had done nothing, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
executed his Orders. Perhaps there never
appeared in this Minister any Passion more eager
than upon this Encounter. He committed the
Affair to the Count <hi>de Moret,</hi> a Gentleman of
very good Sence, great Merit, his Favourite,
and an intimate Friend of the Viscount <hi>Turenne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court was then at <hi>Calais,</hi> and the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Turenne</hi> near <hi>Dunkirk:</hi> The Count <hi>de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
went two or three times to him, under other
Pretences, but in Reality upon this Account
only. <hi>Moret</hi> endeavoured all he could to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Cardinal from a Thought which
agreed so little with his Condition and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;
He omitted nothing likewise which
he thought might induce the Viscount <hi>de Turenne</hi>
to compound for the Complaisance which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
of him upon this Occasion; he (among
the Difficulties of a Negotiation so well intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which did not succeed) thought himself, at
last, obliged to tell the Viscount <hi>de Turenne</hi>
plainly, That he had Reason to fear that an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Refusal, would have very disadvantageous
Effects upon his Fortune, since, upon the first
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50645:72"/>
Scruples which he had made, the Cardinal shewed
himself to be very much exasperated.</p>
            <p>The Viscount <hi>Turenne,</hi> who could not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Hopes, neither was so by Fears; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
answered as he had done already, That the
Cardinal might put into History any thing that
might flatter his Ambition, and make Posterity
believe that he was a great Captain; but as for
his own part, he would never be reproached
with having given him a Title to Authorize a
thing so contrary to his Honour and the Truth.</p>
            <p>Almost at this very time, the King fell sick at
<hi>Calais,</hi> and was so ill, that he was thought to be
dead. The Cardinal, not thinking that he stood
fair with the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who was onely Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the King, would assure himself of those
who were about him; but he had Reason to fear
they would not be very favourable to him. In
this Extremity he had Recourse to the Viscount
<hi>Turenne:</hi> his Design was to go and join him, in
case he should be forc'd to retire from Court.
He sent the Count <hi>de Moret</hi> to him, to engage
him to offer himself, and to secure the Army.
The Count had Order to negotiate this Affair
with much Address, and rather to insinuate
things, than speak 'em; but he knowing that
this was the most improper Method of gaining
upon the Viscount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> he spoke to him
in his ordinary way, without any manner of
Disguise. The Viscount <hi>de Turenne</hi> promised
immediately, That he would Speak and Act
publickly as a Friend to the Cardinal; that he
would represent likewise to <hi>Monsieur</hi> when he
came to the Crown, that in the Condition things
stood then, it would be very dangerous to take
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50645:72"/>
Affairs out of the Hand of a Minister, who was so
able and so well establish'd. The Count <hi>de Moret</hi>
judging that the Cardinal would not be satisfied
with this Answer, represented to Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi>
all that he thought might induce him to comply
with his Demands. He told him, amongst other
things, that the Cardinal could never resolve to
form a Party in <hi>France,</hi> and that infallibly the
Queen-Mother would uphold her Fortune. That
there was no doubt to be made of the Credit she
had with <hi>Monsieur,</hi> nor the Protection she would
give the Cardinal; and so by offering to follow
blindly the Interests of this Minister, the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Turenne</hi> might without any Hazard, lay
such Obligations upon him, as he would always
remember. The Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi> answered,
That there was a great deal of probability things
would go thus, but that he would never promise
more than he now had offered, adding that no
Advantage, how great soever, was able to oblige
him to give such promises as might afterwards
bring him into a Necessity either to break them,
or to fall into the Misfortunes which he was
now got out off.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal was in effect so little content
with this Answer, that after having several
times sworn his Ruine, he said a great many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
things; sometime, as enraged; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
as dejected: but the King grew well,
and his Care, or the Continuation of the War,
made the Cardinal forget, or suspend his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment.</p>
            <p>He diverted himself with Men of Sense, and
Letters, but had no patience with those who
professed themselves to be the <hi>Beaux Esprits.</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:50645:73"/>
they had no share in his Bounties, nor he any
great one in their Works.</p>
            <p>When free from business, he used to recreate
himself, and especially in his Entertainments,
but without excess. He would laugh easily at
pleasant Discourse and Raillery; and he himself
would make use of it in his turn, but always with
a great deal of Civility and Discretion. He was
moved with such Writings as were natural and
lively, loved to read good Books, and especially
History. He made his use of it, but scarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
spoke upon the subject.</p>
            <p>He could not bear a moments Flattery, as
such, but when it was under the appearance of
a true Friendship, and such occasions of praising
him were taken as fell in naturally; he took it
easily, and then a Flatterer might insinuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into him, be establish'd in his good opinion,
and reap the advantages.</p>
            <p>He was born in the Reform'd Religion, he
profess'd it more than fifty years, without being
well instructed in it. At this Age he began to
have some scruples, and without declaring them
to any Body, he endeavoured to clear them up
by his reading; but this serv'd only to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and strengthen them. Then he came to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
but only as by way of Conversation,
lest his condition might be discovered; The
Queen-Mother first apprehended it, spoke to
him, and declared, that besides the motives of
his Salvation, there were other Temporal ones,
which made her ardently desire to see him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Catholick.</hi> This Discourse which would
have wrought great Effects upon other Minds,
set all the good motions of Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi> in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50645:73"/>
suspense, and threw him for several years into
great indifferency of advancing further; for it
is true that he was afraid lest his Conversion
should be followed by some remarkable favour,
which might make the purity of his Intentions to
be called in question, and bring a stain upon his
Glory; but at last, urg'd by his Conscience, he
declared his doubts openly, sometimes to the
Bishop of <hi>Tournay,</hi> sometimes to the Bishop of
<hi>Condom,</hi> and to Monsieur <hi>de Boucherat</hi> Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
of State (afterwards Chancellor of <hi>France)</hi>
his particular Friends, in whom he placed a great
confidence, but he opened himself still more
freely to the Cardinal <hi>Bouillon,</hi> his Nephew,
whom God would make an Instrument to perfect
the Conversion of so great a Man. In short, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
convinced that he was out of the true Church,
he went to make his Abjuration to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Paris,</hi> without giving him any notice
till the night before. He was there only with
Monsieur <hi>de Boucherat,</hi> whom he had desired to
Accompany him thither, but without having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
his design, till a few days before.</p>
            <p>There have been evident proofs of the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Conversion, during the rest of his
Life, he testified it likewise by his Will, which
appeared since his Death; for after having
thanked God for granting him the knowledge of
his Truth, he gave considerable Legacies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
towards the subsistence of those who
should follow his Example. To this end he gave
to the Poor who should be converted at <hi>Sedan,</hi>
and the Lands thereon depending, the sum of
50000. Livers, and to the Poor that should be
Converted at <hi>Negrepelece,</hi> the summ of 20000.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50645:74"/>
Livers; to the Poor that should be Converted at
<hi>Chastilion,</hi> the like summ; which summs he
would have to be distributed to the Poor who
should be Converted in the foresaid places, or
laid out in Rents for them, all at the Discretion
of Cardinal <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Boucherat,</hi>
whom he desires to be his Executors. This Will
is punctually Executed in all points by the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Boucherat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Love and Veneration which the Souldiers
had always for him, were much increased in the
latter Campaigns: this appeared amongst other
occasions the year before his Death, when in the
midst of Winter, he made an extraordinary
march to attacque the Enemy at the Passage of
the River <hi>D' Ill,</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All his Campaigns since the War with <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
contained Prodigies of Valour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which would furnish matter for several
Volumes, should we enter into particulars; but
after having escaped a multitude of Dangers for
fifty Years together, which he employed in War;
his Army, and that of the Enemies, facing one
another, at <hi>Sulsback,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> He was killed
by a Cannon Bullet, discharged almost at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in a Place where they were raising a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.
He received the blow in the midst of his
Heart, at the same instant that he stopt his Horse
to speak to Saint <hi>Hilaire,</hi> Lieutenant of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Hilaire</hi> had one Arm carried away at
the same time, and said a thing very remarkable
to two of his Sons, who wept to see him in that
Condition; <hi>Alas, Children,</hi> (said he) <hi>you ought not
to weep for me, but this Great Man,</hi> (shewing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50645:74"/>
them the Viscount <hi>Turenne) which is the most irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Loss that</hi> France <hi>has ever suffered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps there was never seen any Example of
a Grief which was so great and general at the
same time: and I cannot think that of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
People, after the Death of <hi>Marcellus, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus,</hi>
or <hi>Titus,</hi> could be compared to the
Condition <hi>France</hi> was in upon this Occasion;
Especially, it's impossible to express the Concern
of the Soldiers; It appeared for several days
together after his Death, to be very fresh
and moving.</p>
            <p>Those who commanded the Army having
caused a Halt to be made, to hold a Council, what
way they should take; the Soldiers, concerned to
see the Delay of their Resolutions, began to say
aloud and with one Voice, <hi>They have nothing to
do but to let</hi> la Pie, (which was an Excellent Horse
known by the whole Army, and one that the
Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi> generally mounted) <hi>go loose,
and where the poor Creature stops, let them encamp
there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the distant Provinces, where this Prince
was scarce known but by his Reputation, the
News of his Death made a very surprizing Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
the Nobility and People, for several
days together, could speak of nothing else but
the Greatness of their Loss. Many bewailed
him, without having ever seen him. Some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to this Grief, by the Memory of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
others, in Consideration of the Services
which he might still have rendered them; and
all in general, as being sensible of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Misfortune, by which so Great a Man
came to his End.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:50645:75"/>
At <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Countries thereabouts, and
particularly upon the Frontiers, which were the
Seat of War, the Passion was more touching and
lively; because they knew him better, and were
used to see him come back every Winter with a
new Load of Glory. In short, it seemed as if
his Loss had been the entire Defeat of an Army,
or that each private Person in the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
had lost their best Friend, or their whole
Fortune.</p>
            <p>Since, in his Life-time, there came out a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
between Him and <hi>Caesar,</hi> I think I may
Remark, That as the small Agreement that
there is between a Monarchy and a Republick,
made them tread different Paths to Glory, so
their Deaths bore no greater Resemblance. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
was assassinated in the time of Peace, by his
own Citizens, whom he had oppressed; and the
Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi> lost his Life in War, with
his Arms in his hand: beloved by all the World,
and serving his King and Countrey, without any
other Interest, than that of Glory, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of his Duty.</p>
            <p>He began to appear in the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the
XIII<hi>th,</hi> and being upheld by his Merit and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
he pass'd without Favour or Disgrace, all
the time that Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> was Master of
Affairs.</p>
            <p>Under Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Ministry, Fortune
used him variously, but for the last 20 Years of
his Life, he had no Reason to complain of
her.</p>
            <p>He found a thousand Occasions of gaining
such a Glory, as will be immortalized by all the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50645:75"/>
Histories of <hi>Europe;</hi> and he esteem'd himself so
much the happier, in living under a King who
had all the Qualities desireable in a Master, and
who treated him with such Confidence and
Esteem, that he might love him as a Friend.</p>
            <p>I leave it to such as write his History to say,
how far he extended the King's Conquests, in
the last War, and what his Thoughts were,
touching the Affairs in <hi>Germany.</hi> No one knew
certainly what the Motives were, that made him
take so long and difficult a March to seize that
Post where he was slain; all we can learn, is,
that some hours before his Death he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself great Advantages from this last
Action of his Life; and he was so far from all
Presumption, that when he began to think well
of his own Undertakings, other People might
take his Hopes for an entire Certainty of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Success; so that if those who were at the
Head of the Army after his Death, have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Rewards and Praises, the Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi>
being no less above them in his great Knowledge
of War, than by his Quality of General: We
have Reason to think, that the Event of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
which he had so long before premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
would have been much more Great and
more Glorious.</p>
