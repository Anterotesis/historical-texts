            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>GReat was our Expectation upon the Succeſs of our late Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, <hi>Kaia Nebbe,</hi> his Negotiation into <hi>England,</hi> of ſetling a Commerce with that Kingdom, which as it is of all Nations in moſt eſteem with, ſo is it moſt earneſtly deſired by the <hi>Bantamites,</hi> who have a natural kindneſs for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in theſe Parts.</p>
            <p>Whilſt we were big with theſe Joys, a ſuddain and unexpected Storm happen'd, which blaſted all our hopes in an Inſtant, and unmercifully expos'd us, not onely to the fury of a Domeſtick Enemy, but the Spoil and Rapine of a Forreign Foe.</p>
            <p>Sir, It would be but a needleſs trouble to tell you the true Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and real Friendſhip that has been preſerv'd between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Bantamites.</hi> Theſe allowing them a Factory, and a Place of Reſidence for their Conſult within the Walls of the Town of <hi>Bantam,</hi> which is the Capital City of <hi>Java,</hi> wheras all other Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as the <hi>Bengallians, Cuſarats, Malayans, Abyſſins, Chineſes, Portugals</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> are placed without the Town, nay, the very <hi>Indians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who come from the Borders of the Country, have their places allotted them without the City, where they have their Markets for their particular Commodities, the Grand <hi>Bazor,</hi> or Exchange, being in the Eaſt part of the Town, wholy employed in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory, and for ſtowing up the Commodities they Trade in.</p>
            <p>Since the laſt Maſſacre of the Dutch in this Nation, they have not dealt ſo freely amongſt us, but keep within their own Plantation at <hi>Batavia,</hi> which is ſome 12 Leagues from <hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugals</hi> that deal at <hi>Bantam,</hi> live out of Town in the ſame Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> They drive here a great Trade in Pepper, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, Cloves, Mace, Sandal-wood, Cubebs, long Pepper, and other Commodities that are ſent them from <hi>Malacca;</hi> for the greater part of them are Factors, and Commiſſioners of the Governour of <hi>Malacca,</hi> and the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Goa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> beſides their liberty of Reſiding within the Town of <hi>Bantam,</hi> have free Acceſs through the whole Country of <hi>Java Major,</hi> which is a vaſt and ſpacious Iſle, for, from Eaſt to Weſt it ſtretches 150 Leagues, or of Miles 450, and from North to South 90 Leagues, which is 270 Miles Engliſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96809:2"/>
The <hi>Dutch,</hi> who joined with the Rebels in this unnatural Incurſion, to Invade our City with the more eaſe, we being ſo unprovided of Ammunition, and all other Conveniences, to make any conſiderable Reſiſtance. In which they had found much more Difficulty, and it is probable, we might have held out as yet, had we received that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit of Arms and Ammuntion, as was every Day expected by the Embaſſador from <hi>England,</hi> who is not yet come.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>(Sir)</hi> leads me to the Tragical part of my Letter, which muſt needs create pity in you, when you conſider in what Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this ſuddain change hath left us, not able to call our Lives or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes our own, nor can we yet tell whether we are Freeman or Slaves.</p>
            <p>During the Abſence of our Embaſſador in <hi>England,</hi> a Match was propoſed by the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> between his Eldeſt Son <hi>Zerombia Zebbe,</hi> and the Daughter of the King of <hi>Mitram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was a Match well propoſed, and had been Fortunate for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> had it taken its wiſhed ſucceſs, the King of <hi>Mitram</hi> being as it were Emperour of <hi>Java Major.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Young Prince going upon this Expedition, fell in Love, by the way, with the King of <hi>Tubans</hi> Daughter, which, next to <hi>Bantam,</hi> is the chiefeſt Town in <hi>Java.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince having forgot all other Obligations, it was not long e're the Marriage was unhappily Solemniz'd, tho' it was much inferiour to what had been formerly propoſed. The King of <hi>Tubans</hi> Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being but ſmall, and he himſelf a Tributary to the King of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam.</hi> Beſides, the King of <hi>Tuban</hi> having Four Wives, Six Sons, and Two Daughters, beſides Natural-Children, and Concubines innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; the Princeſs, which was the former Match propoſed, being ſole Heireſs to the Emperour.</p>
            <p>This ſo Incenſed the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> that he Excludes his Son out of the Kingdom, making his Younger Son, by a Second Wife, his Heir.</p>
            <p>The Prince no leſs Incenſed on the other hand, Marched with a ſmall Army of the <hi>Tubanites</hi> towards <hi>Batavia,</hi> deſiring Aid of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were forward enough to Aſſiſt him, as well for the old Grudg that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd between them, and the <hi>Bantamites,</hi> as to Enlarge their Dominions upon any opportunity that preſents.</p>
            <p>There being a <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet at <hi>Batavia,</hi> they took Shipping, and lay before <hi>Bantam,</hi> on the 23d of <hi>November,</hi> playing with their Great Canon upon the Town, during which time the King made ſeveral proffers of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, but nothing wou'd be accepted.</p>
            <p>At laſt all our Ammunition being ſpent, and our Walls Battered down, on the 2d of <hi>December</hi> they Enterect the Town, Seizing upon the <hi>Bazor,</hi> and all places of Factory and Store, Killing and Plundering all before them.</p>
            <p>The King, with the chief Officers of the City, keeps his Army in the Field, where by Daily Recruits which flock to him from all parts, he hopes, yet, in ſome time, to Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cover his former Loſſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have poſſeſt themſelves of the Port, and the Rebels of the City. We are every Day Threatn'd to be turn'd out, and a <hi>Dutch</hi> Factory and Conſul Eſtabliſh'd in our place. All the hopes we have, is, of the Return of the Embaſſadour, and the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Kings Army, of which we hope to give you a better Account by the next.</p>
