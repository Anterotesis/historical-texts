         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>HAving perused the Book called
<hi>The Theory of the Earth:</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it simply and abstractedly in it
self, as a Philosophic <hi>Scheme</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of things; I found it a Treatise,
not unworthy of the ingenious Author of it.
Though so it was not without its <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or
Defects. But then taking it as it relates to the
Doctrine of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and so bears the Title,
<note n="*" place="margin">Hanc Theori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am <hi>Sacram</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pello, cùm Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luris Physiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giam communem non respiciat; sed majores mundi nostri vicissitudines, quarum meminit Sacra Scriptura. <hi>Praefat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad Lectorem.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Sacred;</hi> I thought it liable to several <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of these I determin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to set down forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and in a Letter transmit them to the
learned <hi>Theorist.</hi> But my Pen growing warm,
quite our-run the bounds of my first Intentions;
and forcing me to alter the Method I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
<pb facs="tcp:102637:3"/>
carry'd things on to this length, and
drew them up in this Form.</p>
            <p>My Design is only an humble Proposal of
some few <hi>Exceptions</hi> against the <hi>Essentials</hi> of
the <hi>Theory.</hi> And I as humbly beg, that they
may not be mistaken, as to their <hi>Rise;</hi>
nor misconst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ued, as to their <hi>End.</hi> They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>low
but from <hi>Affection</hi> to <hi>Truth;</hi> and are directed to
her <hi>Vindication.</hi> Let none therefore think them
off-springs of a narrow mind, or issues of a
captious disputatious Spirit; much less of a
stingy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icque against Philosophy, to which, as
I owe all becoming veneration, so I shall ever
duly pay it.</p>
            <p>Nor have I ingaged with the Theory at all
because it is <hi>New;</hi> but because it is <hi>False.</hi> For
all that is <hi>true,</hi> must needs be <hi>ancient:</hi> only the
<hi>Discovery</hi> of some truth may be <hi>New.</hi> But
then every such discovery of important truth,
is highly to be valued and applauded: To
be welcom'd into the World with thanks and
joy; and entertain'd with reverence and a
sweet reception. Yea as every such Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of weighty Truth, ought to be receiv'd
with great kindness and respect; so that happy
Person, who makes the Discovery, ought to be
exceedingly honoured too, and lookt upon as
deserving a Coronet and a Monument. And
<pb facs="tcp:102637:3"/>
for my own part, I had much rather assist with
my hands in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itting up both; than write one
word or syllable with my Pen, to hinder him
of either.</p>
            <p>Again therefore I heartily profess my Scope,
to be nothing else but a <hi>Vindication</hi> of <hi>Truth;</hi>
unless I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hall add, and of <hi>Religion</hi> also. For
though I am far from that temper, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<note n="*" place="margin">In the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> to the <hi>Eng. Theory.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>alarm'd at the proposal of every new
Theory, as if all Religion were falling about our
ears:</hi> yet I am sensible the <hi>Theorist</hi> has assaulted
<hi>Religion,</hi> and that in the very <hi>foundation</hi> of
it. And therefore he must not blame me,
if I have taken the <hi>alarm</hi> (to use his own
word) when he was pleased in such a manner
to give it. And truly should not some of us
have been awakened by it, considering how
loud he rings it in our ears; he might well
have concluded, we were too fast asleep.</p>
            <p>When the fourteen<note n="†" place="margin">Liv. Hist. Dec. 4. lib. 10.</note> Books of <hi>Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius,</hi>
that ancient and famous King of <hi>Rome,</hi>
were found in the Earth in a Chest of Stone;
and being taken out were perused by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral:
at last, upon the Praetor <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tilius</hi>'s report,
that they contained <hi>pleraque dissolvendarum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionum,
many things</hi> tending <hi>to the undoing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
(at least in some Ceremonies or appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages
of it) they were condemned by the
<pb facs="tcp:102637:4"/>
               <hi>Senate</hi>—An Argument of their tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and due concern for the Religion they
had, though but a mean one. Now allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our regard for Religion, to exceed that
of the <hi>Romans</hi> (as in reason it should) but
as much as <hi>our</hi> Religion exceedeth <hi>theirs:</hi> and
how deeply must we res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt (especially those
of us in Holy Orders) even the smallest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
done unto it? But then when Books
come forth too like to <hi>Numa</hi>'s, the Contents
whereof strike at <hi>Religion;</hi> the least we can do,
is to complain of the abuse, and endeavour
meekly to confute them.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>the Theory of the Earth</hi> does strike
at Religion, and <hi>assault</hi> it (as I said) in the very
<hi>Foundation</hi> of it; is but too evident. For in
several things (as will appear in our Discourse)
it contradicts <hi>Scripture;</hi> and by<note n="*" place="margin">Read the 17th Chapter of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note> 
               <hi>too positive</hi>
asserting the truth of its own Theorems,
makes <hi>that</hi> to be false; upon which our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is founded. And to assert such things
positively, as imply Scripture to be false in
any Periods of it; must be of very pernicious
consequence. For if it fails in <hi>some</hi> instances,
it may do so in <hi>many:</hi> and that which renders
it suspected in <hi>part,</hi> will impeach the credit of
the <hi>whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:102637:4"/>
Let it be noted therefore that the Dispute
here, is not meerly whether the World we
live in, be the same <hi>now,</hi> as it was of <hi>old</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Flood: or whether there be not as
much difference betwixt its <hi>primaeval,</hi> and its
<hi>present</hi> State; as betwixt a goodly Structure,
when standing in its glory, and groveling in
its ruines: but (which is far more material)
whether some sacred and <hi>revealed Truths;</hi> or
gay, but groundless <hi>Philosophic Phancies;</hi> shall
be preferred.</p>
            <p>The Book has lain by in Manus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ript a great
while. Why it did so, is well known to
<hi>some</hi> good Men; and I need not trouble <hi>all</hi>
with the Reasons of it. But when none
(as I could learn) were dispos'd to write
better; I let it come abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In it, I have not (to speak in the</hi> Theorist<hi>'s
language)</hi>

<hi>his Hypothesis,</hi> upon general presumptions and
prejudices, nor according to the temper and model
of my own spirit; but <hi>(I think)</hi> according to
reason. <hi>And that I might not</hi> impose upon
my self or others, have laid aside that lazy and
fallacious method of censuring by the lump, <hi>and
endeavoured</hi> to bring things close to the Test of
<hi>true</hi> and <hi>false,</hi> to explicit proof and evidence.
And whosoever, <hi>says he,</hi> makes such Objections
<pb facs="tcp:102637:5"/>
against an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> hath a <hi>Right</hi> to be heard.
<hi>This</hi> Right <hi>therefore, so far as it is mine, and
I may lawfully do it; I now challenge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude. Whereas I have endeavoured
to explain the Universal Deluge, in a new and
unusual way; I would by no means be
thought to ground upon it, as certainly
true: but only to show that another way of
opening and unfolding that intricate <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi>
may be found out, as <hi>plausible</hi> or <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable</hi>
as that which the <hi>Theory</hi> goes in. And
truly for my own part, I am much of the
Opinion of a very learned Friend of mine
(a great ornament both to the University
and the Faculty he is of) who upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal
of this Book in Manuscript, wrote this
to me among other things: <hi>Though we have</hi>
Moses, <hi>yet I believe we must stay for</hi> Elias, <hi>to
make out to us, the true Philosophical</hi> modus <hi>of the
Creation, and Deluge.</hi>

Cabbalism</hi> cannot overthrow it. 7. The <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Cabbalizing,</hi>
still allowed a <hi>Literal meaning</hi> to Scripture; only they superadded
a <hi>Mystical one,</hi> never <hi>contrary</hi> to it. 8. Though were there

Which indeed does very much qualifie and dispose us
for true Religion; and is rarely instrumental to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

               <p>To make out this fully, how useful and serviceable
Philosophy is, to promote Religion; would require a
whole Volume. Let me only touch upon a few
Particulars.</p>
               <p>2. First, it is useful, <hi>To prove, There is a GOD.</hi> Of
all the Fundamentals of Religion, this is the chief.
Yet if Philosophy did not lend us some Topicks,
from whence we might fetch Arguments, to evince
and confirm the Existence of a DEITY; all that we
could say, would be too cold and languid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
the Atheist. But when that discovers an absolute
necessity of a First Cause, and of a First Mover; and
of an infinitely Wife and Powerful Creator of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
and of as infinitely Wise and Powerful a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the same: Or else on the other hand, shews
a necessity of Deifying the World itself, by bestowing
Godlike Attributes upon it; and of granting <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movency,
Life</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> to Matter; with
other most notorious and numberless Absurdities:
Then he must either openly confess there is a GOD,
or with silence submit to a Belief of his Being.</p>
               <p>And what a considerable stroke Philosophy has
in proving there is a GOD, <hi>Plutarch</hi> fairly gives
us to understand; where he declares,<note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>They had the
knowledge of a GOD, from the Stars which appeared,

To which agrees what we read, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 13. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>3. Secondly, <hi>To acquaint us with the Nature of the
DEITY.</hi> For what to make of his Immatorial or
Spiritual Essence; of his Necessary and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence;
of his Ubiquity or Omnipresence; of a
TRINITY in Unity; or Three distinct Persons, in
one and the same undivided Nature, and common
essential Substance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we should be utterly at a
loss, were it not for Philosophy. Not that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
can enable us to look to the Centre of God's
Perfections neither, and throughly to understand him;
that's impossible. For he is nothing else but GLORY
and GREATNESS. And such is the Brightness of
the one, and the Immenseness of the other, yea, the
Infiniteness of both, that no created Capacities, with
all the helps they can possibly get, shall attain to a
clear and full knowledge of him. Yea, much of the
felicity of the Eternal State, seems to lye in this; That
as we shall always see more and more of GOD, so we
shall never be able to discern <hi>all:</hi> But shall incessantly
be entertained with fresh Perceptions of new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
arising from fresh Apprehensions, and new
Discoveries of the incomprehensible Goodness and
Beauties of the Divinity. Which Apprehensions will
be so very clear, and the Oblectations issuing from them
so high and strong, in reiterated rapturous Vibrations
in the Soul, that we shall be strangely overflowed,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102637:12"/>
and as it were quite swallowed up of endless and
most beatifying Satisfactions. And O amazing Bliss
and Happiness indeed, where we shall ever be sinking
deeper and deeper still in an abyss of intellectual
Joy and Sweetness! This will make our condition
a boundless Ocean of transporting Pleasures; as
GOD's Nature is a like Ocean of Divinest Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies.
But then if GOD be too Glorious and Great
to be perfectly understood by us in the Mansions above
(where the dormant Powers and Faculties of our Souls
(which perhaps are many) shall be all awakened into
lively Actings) how much less can Philosophy help us
to understand him compleatly, here in these lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions?
Yet as Men may see more with a good Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective,
than they can do without it; so we may
better acquaint our selves with the Nature of GOD,
being assisted by Philosophy, than if we had it not.
And the truth is, even the very <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of
GOD, the two most informing things we have, the
most apt and able to lead us into competent knowledge
of His MAJESTY, without Philosophy, are neither
of them to be rightly or tolerably understood in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Instances.</p>
               <p>4. Thirdly, <hi>To assert a Providence, and the free use
of our Faculties. Astra regunt homines, Stars govern
Men,</hi> has taken great place in the World: Insomuch that
a Mans <hi>Stars,</hi> and his <hi>Destiny,</hi> have been Terms equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.
As free Agents as we are, they have been
thought to controll us; to be Disposers of our Lot,
and Dispensers of our Portion, and the Masters of
our Fortune. To incline our Minds, and to sway
our Wills; to determin our Motions, and over-rule
our Actions; staking us down as it were in all our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
by irresistible force, or tying us up to fatal
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102637:12"/>
necessity. A Persuasion most strange, and also as false.
It might come from hence. The Stars were observed
to be very numerous, and for their largeness, most
considerable Bodies. And therefore for them only to
shine in the Night-time, and that with so pitiful a
light, as every little Fog or Cloud can obscure, might
well be thought too mean a work for them, at least
for their whole Employment. Whereupon to intitle
them to another Task, more noble and suitable, they
were fancied to have Mankind committed to their
charge, to be ruled by them with an absolute Regency.
But whence sprang this Mistake, of the Stars Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency
and Sovereign Dominion, save merely from
the want of sound Philosophy? For as many as are
tolerably vers'd in that, know they can have no such
Influence or Empire; but are wholly incapable of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
a Regiment of that Nature over us. And
do know as well likewise to what other great Ends
or Uses they may serve, most worthy of themselves;
much better than to such an impossible Jurisdiction,
as has been wildly and unreasonably attributed to
them.</p>
               <p>5. Fourthly, <hi>To exclude Idolatry.</hi> The most general
and constant Idol among Men, has been the Sun.
And how came he to be so? Why, from his Motion,
he might probably be reputed an Animal: And from
his regular Motion, he might as well be thought to
have Understanding. And then from these Notions
or Persuasions concerning him, Men might easily
ascend to an higher yet, and fancy him a Being of
Divine Perfections; as <hi>Cardan</hi> and <hi>Vaninus</hi> did. And
so it would be natural to honour him as a GOD, by
paying Divine Worship to him. Yea, a long and
prevailing Doctrine it has been, That the Sun (though
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102637:13"/>
he was not a rational and understanding Creature
himself) was actuated and directed by a Spirit or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence.</hi>
And this seems an Opinion, but one remove
from the other; and might give too just occasion and
encouragement to superstitious Adoration of the Sun;
if not open a wide door whereat it might enter. But
then true Philosophy interposing here, makes so full
a discovery of his Nature, as may throughly abolish
and for ever destroy all grounds and reasons of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Practices in reference to him. Though through
want of such Philosophy at <hi>Athens, Anaxagoras</hi> fell
under a double misfortune; being at once both fin'd
and banish'd, for calling the Sun a meer Globe of
Fire.</p>
               <p>The like also is applicable to the Stars, the Moon,
and the rest of the Planets; which too often, and with
too many, have been reputed Deities, and treated
accordingly. And therefore <hi>Philo</hi> says, they were

               </p>

that is, and clearing it up, in some of its most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Points or Articles. In it are delivered the most
high and important things that can be; and they seem
to be as difficult in their Proof, as they are lofty and
momentous in their Nature and Accomplishment.
But from Philosophy they receive good Light and
Confirmation.</p>
               <p>7. Of this kind, in the first place, is, <hi>The Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Soul.</hi> The certain truth or reality of which,
is abundantly evidencd by plenty of Arguments from
the several <hi>Places</hi> of Philosophy. Thus, it teaches
(for Instance) that the Soul is a spiritual or imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102637:13"/>
substance: and so, distinct from the Body, and
independent upon it. Which Proposition alone,
throughly confirmed, is sufficient to establish her Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality;
and that strongly and impregnably, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the Cavils and perverse Objections, that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Wits of captious <hi>Somatists</hi> can raise in contempt,
or (as they imagine) in confutation of it. And
that the Soul is a purely spiritual Being, and so,
quite different from, and exalted above the Nature
of Body; even then when she animates it, and lives
in closest conjunction with it: Philosophy gives us
clearly to understand, from her POWERS Or FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CULTIES,
and from her OPERATIONS.
I mean while it inables us to apprehend and judge,
that they are too lofty and excellent, too regular and
active (as being vital and intellectual) to be in any
measure compatible to meer corporeity; though of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so sublimate and refin'd a consistency.</p>
               <p>Thus, we know, the Soul can move and perceive,
and understand and consider, and reason and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
and deliberate and determine, and choose
and refuse. That she is capable of framing universal
Propositions, and of apprehending spiritual and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
Essences, and the Numbers, and Notions,
and Ideaes of things. That she is able to correct the
seeming representations of Sense and Fantasie; and
when Objects appear in such Distance, or Figure, or
Colour, or Magnitude: to think and infer that they
must be otherwise. That she has power to strive
with the Bodily Appetites; and after many, and
long, and vehement Colluctations, to master and
subdue them. She going one way, by vertue of that
free and innate Rule, which is founded and deeply
radicated in her self: while fly Propensities and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
flowing from inferiour ignoble Passions;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102637:14"/>
do dispose her <hi>to,</hi> and would impetuously hurry her
on <hi>in</hi> another. Where though compliance with the
motions she feels, would be far more pleasing to her
at present, than stout resistance; yet she bravely
stands out, because that in her prospect of future
consequents, she is sensible, yielding would turn to
her prejudice. Yea, she cannot only encounter and
fight against the Body, and maintain both stiff and
lasting conflicts with its brutish affections; but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
delight in the Combates while they hold, and
when they are past, rejoice in the Victory.</p>
               <p>Now all these Powers and Workings of the Soul,
in the Accounts of Philosophy, are Arguments and
indications of her Incorporealness, or distinctness
from the Body. And if we look upon them, as
supervening <hi>to,</hi> or falling in <hi>with</hi> the Evangelical
Doctrine of her Immortality; the Article will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be eternally settled, never to be shaken, much
less to be ruined, by the most powerful Assaults and
furious Batteries, that Atheistical Sophistry can make
against it.</p>
               <p>We are all mortal, and he that lives longest, must
die at last. But when he does so, some are apt to
surmise, <hi>quòd totus moritur,</hi> that he dies wholly and
finally, without or beyond all hope and remedy.
And truly were the Soul no more than what many
would make her; namely, <hi>Crasis, Harmonia, vel Modus
corporis; a Temperament, Harmony, or Modification of the
Body;</hi> his fate might well be supposed such, because
indeed it could be no other. But sound Philosophy,
I say, makes it very evident, that the Soul is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
distinct from the Body. That there is as real,
and as great a difference between them, as there is
between the Prisoner and his Chains; or the House
and its Inhabitant. And therefore several Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102637:14"/>
(and <hi>Socrates</hi> for one) have taught us to call
this Body, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the habitation of the Soul;</hi>
yea, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> her moveable <hi>Prison,</hi> and her
living <hi>Sepulchre.</hi> And the <hi>Essenes</hi> (followers of
<hi>Pythagoras)</hi> reckoned, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> informs us,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;c. that to go out of the Body,
was <hi>like an inlargement from Fetters.</hi> And this
distinctness of the Soul from the Body, does aloud
proclaim her independence upon it; and shows her
to have a vital Power in her self, inabling her to
subsist when separated from it.</p>
               <p>Yet (to shut up the Point) none need marvel that
the excellent Philosopher now mentioned, I mean
<hi>Socrates,</hi> should leave the World with a seeming mistrust
of this great Truth, the Immortality of the Soul,
(with an, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>IF SO BE
the things spoken be true.)</hi> For the wise Man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
at the present, was exceeding black and dark;
and the gloomy lowring circumstances he was in,
might well cloud his mind, and dull his thoughts,
and so depress and sink his Spirit; as to hinder his
quick apprehension of things. And though he was
a very considerable Philosopher in his time, yet the
Gospel which <hi>brought life and</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim, 1. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>immortality to light,</hi>
had not then visited the World: nor did Philosophy
it self, then shine so bright by much, as now it
does. All which rightly weighed, instead of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
at his diffidence, we may rather be amazed at
his Courage and Gallantry. For they who shall read,
what <hi>Plato</hi> relates (in his <hi>Apology)</hi> concerning him,
may well be surprized, not to say, astonished at his
exemplary fortitude; and the generous and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
greatness of his Spirit, at his dying hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:102637:15"/>
8. A second grand Doctrine that Philosophy vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates,
by contributing towards the elucidation of
it, is, <hi>The Resurrection of the Body,</hi> which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
explicitly recommended to the World, till the
Gospel was promulgated. And therefore is fitly
called by <hi>Tertullian, fiducia Christianorum,</hi> the proper
or peculiar <hi>confidence of Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the Atheist can seldom either read, or hear
of, but he is ready to smile, if not to insult. He huggs
it as a dear and most useful notion; As a notion which
he thinks he can form unto an Engin, and that of such
mighty and irresistible force, as shall be able to batter
down the whole Fabrick of the Christian Religion.
That Mens Bodies should die, and be buried, and rot
in their Graves, and grow up into Grass; and this
Grass be eaten by Beasts, and those Beasts be eaten
by Men, and those Men be eaten by Canibals, and
those Canibals devoured by Worms, and those Worms
turned to Dust, and that Dust quite dissipated and lost;
and yet those Bodies rise again, hundreds or thousands
of Years after: How strange and impossible must this
be? How vain and foolish the Religion that teaches
it? How fond and silly the People that believe it?
But Philosophy helps to make out the mystery.</p>
               <p>For that teaches, <hi>That no MATTER does perish;</hi>
that none of it is annihilated or utterly lost. Whereupon
it follows, That when our Bodies are interred, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to Earth, or else burned, and for the most part
evaporate into the Air, or the like: they suffer but a
dissolution and dispersion at worst. And therefore
they may still be capable of being gathered up in their
widest dissipations, and of being made into living Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
again. Provided there be but (as there is) a
Power in the World, that can work them to re-unions,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102637:15"/>
by consigning and adjusting their numberless Particles,
into their respective integral Masses.</p>
               <p>Philosophy teaches also, <hi>That all Matter in being was
once the <hi>same;</hi> and that it is so still, only it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versified
into several kinds, by various Modifications.</hi>
Whence it follows, That (according to the account
we have of the Resurrection) a <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Body,
may become a <hi>Celestial</hi> one; and a <hi>Natural</hi> Body,
may become a <hi>Spiritual</hi> one; this <hi>Corruptible,</hi> may
put on <hi>Incorruptible;</hi> and this <hi>Mortal,</hi> put on <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality;</hi>
and yet be the very <hi>identical</hi> Body that
it formerly was; the same in <hi>Substance,</hi> only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in <hi>Qualities.</hi> As Gold, is the same Gold,
when tried and refined; only more pure than it was
before.</p>
               <p>Farther, the same Philosophy instructs us, <hi>That the
most of that Food, which Men take, does not come to
Assimilation, or absolute conversion into the substance
of their Bodies:</hi> yea, <hi>that very little of it does so.</hi>
Whence it follows again, That the Body of a Man
by being eaten of Cannibals (though it should be
eaten over and over) needs not for <hi>that,</hi> be hindred
from rising again. For, excepting some slender por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it, it slips through the eaters; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
by Concoction it be turned into Chyle, yet it
is not carried on to a full transmutation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into Flesh. So that the greatest part of the
devoured Carkass, is only altered in it self, by pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
through the Vessels of them that eat it; but no
way appropriate to another individual. And the
remains of this macerated changed Carcass (that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ran into the Composition of others) after all its
mutations, being turned at last (to use <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s
word) into <hi>the Substance of Eternity;</hi> shall thereby
be fitted to re-imbody that Soul, which formerly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102637:16"/>
wore it. Yet still it will be the <hi>same</hi> Body (in a
very good (let me say) in a <hi>Gospel</hi> sense) that it
was when it died; forasmuch as it must consist of
the same matter which did then constitute it.
I, and we may still call it <hi>Flesh</hi> too, because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
is so. Only instead of <hi>Corruptible</hi> Flesh (which
not only <hi>shall not,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">

not in the <hi>Essence</hi> of their Bodies.</p>
               <p>Two lively <hi>Specimens,</hi> or Pledges of this admirable
change, which at last shall happen to the Bodies of
the Righteous, to their great improvement in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials;
are given us in the inspired writings.
Which, if duly considered, may serve to strengthen
our Faith, and make us firm and steady in our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the thing. The first of them occurs, <hi>Exod.</hi>
34. in the Person of renowned <hi>Moses.</hi> His Face
shined while he was upon Earth; and at the same
time that it was corruptible Flesh, did glitter with
so bright a lustre, that his fellow Mortals were
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102637:16"/>
not able to behold it. And therefore whenever he
talked with them, he was fain to wear a Vail, over
the dazeling splendours of his radiant Countenance.</p>
               <p>The other St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. in the most adorable
JESUS, at his transfiguration. For then his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Face did not only shine, but shine as the Sun.
And yet at the same time that it was so glorious
and wonderful refulgent; it was but the Flesh that
it us'd to be. And therefore, says the Evangelist,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> he was changed in <hi>form</hi> only. And Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> giving account of the same thing, does it
in these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the
<hi>fashion <hi>of his Countenance was altered;</hi>
                  </hi> but nothing
else. And if the Body of Man, in this state of
Mortality and Imperfection, could put on a shining,
yea, a Sun-like Glory; by a change of its form or
fashion, its modes or qualities: then how easie will
it be for a throughly changing modification, to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduce
such an alteration in all its Properties, at the
Resurrection; as is necessary to make it glorious in its
full capacity. Though when all is done, it shall still be
but (<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>And truly if Chymists by the force of Fire, can
reproduce Flowers (as we are told they can) out of
their own Ashes: and the Herbs that Beasts have

and thinks the DEITY will strike in with
this melting Flame, and strengthen and conduct it,
in its mighty energy, to that very strange and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful

               <p>I say, if he considers, That the DEITY will
strike in, and ingage in the case. For I would be
loth to have a sinister misconstruction made, of what
has been spoken. I mean, by being thought to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the great and miraculous work of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
to the force of Nature only; or the perfect
explication of the manner of its accomplishment,
to the light of Philosophy. All that I have said,
amounts but to thus much, That Philosophy helps
us somewhat better to conceive of the fecibleness of
the thing: as Nature helps much to illustrate its
futurity, and also in some measure to exemplifie or
represent it.</p>
               <p>

the Resurrection, by ordinary Revolutions and Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
in Nature, do the pious and learned Fathers
go. As</hi> Tertullian, Epiphanius, Ruffinus, <hi>St.</hi> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,

               </p>
               <p>Now just as Nature shews the futurity of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
while it prettily adumbrates and prefigures it
to us, by various and lively Symbols and Resemblances;
so Philosophy, another way, leads us into quick and
clear Apprehensions of its possibility. I mean, while
it makes it evident, to such as consider, that a Body

no wonder that Nations should do the

them, Let me mention but a few of those Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,

whose commendation it is, that they inclined
to a belief of the Proposition, That the Dead shall rise

               <p>
                  <hi>Democritus</hi> was of this mind, as we learn from

                  </hi> 1 Cor. 15. 53. But <hi>that</hi> does
not argue, that every <hi>little thing,</hi> which at any time
was an <hi>appurtenance</hi> of the Body, is to be restored to
it when it riseth. If the rising Body does but <hi>wholly</hi>
spring up out of considerable parts of the <hi>former</hi> Body
(out of such parts as perhaps for their <hi>driness, soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi>
&amp;c. could never go to compound any other
humane or carnous Body) this may come up suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
to the Apostle's meaning. For so the raised
Body may fairly be said, to be <hi>this mortal,</hi> cloathed
with immortality; and <hi>this corruptible,</hi> indued with
incorruption; because it will be the same with that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102637:20"/>
Body which was put off at death. The same, I mean,
in a lax and Evangelical sense; and as much the same
(I may venture to say) as our GREAT RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER's
was. For truly concerning <hi>His</hi> Holy
Body, who can make it appear, that some part (and
a good part) of its most precious Blood, was not left
on the Whips, and on the Pavement; on the Nails,
and on the Cross; on the Soldier's Spear, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
on <hi>Calvary:</hi> after his most Sacred MAJESTY
was risen? And yet if it were so, would it not
strongly evince, that the Body raised, need not be the
<hi>same</hi> with the Body dissolved, in a strict and nice, but
only in a moderate or looser acception of Identity?
Which if it might be allowed, whether it would not
rescue the Doctrine of the Resurrection from some
seemingly harsh intanglements and amusing difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
I leave to better Judgments to determin, being
resolved my self not to be definitive.</p>
               <p>The Schools (as is well known) are very strict
here; contending that the same <hi>Numerical</hi> Body, in
the rigidest sense, shall rise again. That the Hairs,
Nails, Blood and Humours, must all return to the
Body, and rise with it. But then let it be noted, in
check to this Opinion, that it can ill be reconcil'd to
another common one of theirs: That is to say, that
the Bodies of Saints shall all arise,<note n="a" place="margin">Aquin. Sam. Theol. sap. Quest. 81. Ar. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>in juvenili aetate,</hi>
as <hi>in youthful age,</hi> and be <hi>ejusdem staturae, of the same
stature</hi> or proportion. So that Infants and Children
shall have their Bodies as large, as if they had died,
<hi>in termino augmenti</hi> (to use their word) in the <hi>acme</hi>
or <hi>full pitch of their perfect Growth.</hi> Now if the self
same, or very <hi>Numerical</hi> Body, shall rise at last; how
is it possible, that Bodies so different in Dimensions and
Quantity at their Dissolution, should ever put on an
equality of Stature at their Resurrection? To affirm
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102637:20"/>
it, is as much as to say, that the raised Body shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
the same for Bulk and Quantity that it was;
and yet be bigger than it was, as to Size; and have
more in it than it had, as to Substance. Else how can
Infant Bodies be improv'd into a parity with those of
adult Persons?</p>
               <p>The Orthodox <hi>Iews</hi> did of old believe there should
be a Resurrection. Though some Heretical ones de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
and rejected it. And others were short and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
in the Faith of it, as not extending it to the
latitude we do, while they appropriated it to the <hi>Iust.</hi>
And others again were phansiful or whimsical about
it; possess'd with that vain and odd conceit of
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the volutation of Caverns.</hi> (Whereby
they fondly imagin'd, that those of them who were
buried out of the Land of <hi>Isreal,</hi> shall be rolled through
subterraneous hollownesses, to rise in <hi>Canaan,</hi> or else
could not rise at all.) Though some, yea, many of
them might be thus carried away; yet the sound and
orthodox <hi>Iews,</hi> I say, did steadily believe a general
Resurrection of the Dead. And therefore in serious
persuasion and expectancy of the thing, they us'd to
call the Grave, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the house of the living.</hi> To
which (by the way) our LORD might allude, when
He would prove the Resurrection against the <hi>Sadducees,</hi>
by that Passage out of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Writings (which they
allowed, though they cast off the rest of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament)
<hi>I am the GOD of Abraham, and the GOD
of Isaac, and the GOD of Iacob; GOD is not the GOD
of the dead, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but of the <hi>Living.</hi>
                  </hi> Where he
could not mean only, that <hi>the Souls</hi> of those Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
were then alive (for that would have been no
just Proof of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the resurrection of the <hi>Dead.</hi>
                  </hi>)
But he meant, that the Bodies of those famous Men
(considerable pieces of the Individuals) without which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102637:21"/>
they could never recover the intire Personality they
once had, were to be reckoned among the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or
<hi>living;</hi> as being potentially alive, alive in GOD's Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
or Decree; and most certainly to be raised up,
being actually revived at last.</p>
               <p>But that which I mentioned the <hi>Iews</hi> Belief of the
Resurrection for chiefly, is this: It was an Opinion
among them, That the Body which riseth at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
shall commence and spring up from a Bone
(in the Back) called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Which Bone the <hi>Rabbies</hi>
will have to be incorruptible; and alledge the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s
words for it; <hi>He keepeth all his Bones, Unum ex iis non
conteretur, <hi>One</hi> of them shall not be broken,</hi> Psal. 34. 20.
Now though this be nothing but an empty conceit,
yet it gives us the measure of the <hi>Iews</hi> Thoughts in
the case; and plainly hints, That they were not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
or much concern'd about the same <hi>Numerical</hi>
Body's rising again; but deemed it sufficient to have
the rising Body, made out of that Body which is laid
down at death, or out of any part of it.</p>
               <p>9. Another Article of extraordinary consequence,
is, <hi>The Conflagration of the Earth.</hi> Of this the Gospel
speaks expresly, <hi>The Earth and the Works that are
therein shall be burnt up, 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 10. A positive
Prediction, say the Atheistical and Incredulous: But
how shall it be verified? Where is there Fire enough
to do it? Here Philosophy assists again, by giving in
most satisfactory Information. For it well assures us,
That there are vast Stores of Fire <hi>about</hi> the Earth, as
well as Treasuries of Fire <hi>in</hi> it: Yea, that the little
Pores of almost every Body, have abundance of this
Element lurking in them. So that we may wonder
that the fiery Principle does not forthwith break out,
and set all on a flame; rather than that it should take
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102637:21"/>
place at last, and seizing upon the World (I mean this
Terrestrial one) burn it up by a furious and inextin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable
combustion; <hi>it being</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> speaks it) <hi>delug'd with Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. In the Fifth place: The Gospel gives account
of <hi>a fiery Punishment prepared for Reprobates,</hi> and of
the <hi>Eternity</hi> of that Fire which is to plague and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
them. So we read in the Final Sentence, <hi>Depart
from me ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared,</hi> &amp;c.
An impossible thing, says the prophane Objector.
No Fire can burn for ever; for where should be a
supply of Fuel to continue it? Indeed a great Pile
may make a great Fire; and durable Fuel may make
a lasting one. But that any Fire should be <hi>everlasting,</hi>
is not to be thought; it would want fit <hi>pabulum,</hi> or
matter to cherish it, and inable it to subsist. Were
all Combustibles amassed together, and made into
one heap; were the whole Earth (as large as it is)
turned into a <hi>fomes</hi> or aliment for it, it could not hold
always. No, it must spend apace, and waste and
burn out into Cinders or Ashes; and so the Fire that
dwelt in it, and preyed upon it, must be starved and
die. This is a Knot that Philosophy unties with the
greatest ease; and no only allows what our SAVIOUR
has said, to be probable and true; but adds confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to what he has authenticated, by casting in the
Overplus of its own authority. For it tells us there
is a certain matter in the World, that burns of it self,
and will burn for ever. It is a Natural and Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Flame; Independent and Vital (I may say)
as being able to support and maintain it self alive,
without any kind of Fuel to preserve and feed it:
So sixt and permanent, that where it is got together
in any good quantities, it may very well challenge
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102637:22"/>
the Epithet of <hi>Vnquenchable;</hi> which is at once the
dreadful Title and Property, whereby the Gospel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
that Infernal Fire that is to be the Instrument
of the Damneds torture. Which must needs have
strange force and vehemence in it to excruciate them;
as being of a most subtil and active, and so of a most
piercing and raging Nature.</p>
               <p>11. Once more let us reflect upon the <hi>Vsefulness</hi> of
Philosophy. It is very great <hi>in reference to Divinity;</hi>
that is, as it attends it in an humble subordination and
service of its Interests. Chiefly in helping to clear
up its Difficulties, and to keep Absurdities from
mingling with its Doctrines. For thô
(as the learned Father truly says)<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>The
Doctrine of our SAVIOVR</hi> (which
is the Marrow of all Divinity) <hi>be perfect,
and stands in need of nothing</hi> (to improve
it) <hi>as being the Power and Wisdom of
GOD: Yet Philosophy coming over to it,
though it makes not the Truth the stronger,
it makes sophistical Argumentation against
it weak; and by driving away decitful
wiles against Truth, may be called a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Fence or Fortification of the Vineyard.</hi>
But not to be tedious:</p>
               <p>Philosophy, we know, has ever been reputed the
Handmaid of Divinity; and its Honour it is, as well
as its Excellency, that it really is so. And indeed
where true and substantial Philosophy does interest
it self in the Affairs of Theology, and serve it with a
decent and respectful Ministry, it becomes of singular
advantage to it. For the most perplext and intricate
Problems it has (provided they be explicable) are no
where made so clear and intelligible, as where Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102637:22"/>
is permitted or employed to intepret them, or
call'd in to assist in the Exposition of them. Whereas
on the contrary, where that is shut out, there is too
much cloudiness and darkness within. Even familiar
things are made confus'd and abstruse, and wrapt up
in a nightsom and remediless obscurity.</p>
               <p>This is obvious to any slight notice. For in those
Theological Systems or Tractates, where Philosophy
has no place (as the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> for instance) People
are miserably gull'd, and shamefully imposed upon,
by monstrous Assertions; and that in common and
easie matters. Yea, in many things, the grossest Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances
pass with them for sublime and solid
Notions; and the fulsomest Non-sense, for venerable
Mysteries; they wanting wherewith to distinguish
betwixt them. And all because they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
destitute of Philosophy; which would afford them
such <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Rules of Judgment, as would inable them
to discern what is true, and what is false; and to
take exact measures of a just discrimination.</p>
               <p>That the Virgin <hi>MARY</hi> conceived by smelling to
a Rose, and was afterwards delivered of Christ at
her Breast. That the Moon once slipt into <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s
Sleeve. That in the End of the World all things
shall die at the winding of an Horn, even Angels
themselves. That the Accursed then following <hi>Cain</hi>
as a Leader, shall carry their Sins in Satchels at their
Backs; the weight of which breaking down the <hi>Bridge
of Iustice</hi> as they go over it, the Delinquents, for their
Punishment, shall fall into a River of Fire that runs
under it. What prodigiously dull and heavy Figments
are these? Yet by the zealous Proselytes of the Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Impostor, they are embraced not only as Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and Consistent, but even as Divine and Miraculous
Truths. But were the light of Philosophy let into the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102637:23"/>
                  <hi>Alcoran,</hi> it would soon chase away these, and all such
egregious and nauseous Fooleries. And together with
them, it would send blindness and ignorance pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too (which are their Parents and their Nurses)
making them flee before it, as Chaff before the
Wind, or as the Shades of the Night before the
Morning Sun.</p>
               <p>And here if it might not be thought too unseemly
a Transition, to pass from the <hi>Turkish</hi> to the <hi>Christian</hi>
Divinity; it would not be impertinent to remark <hi>its</hi>
defectiveness in Philosophy likewise in one particular.
How much better might, <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum, This is
my Body,</hi> have been understood; both as to the credit
of the Proposition, and its influence upon Christians,
if Philosophy had paraphras'd or expounded it? For
then the true Notion of an Humane Body, should
have shut out that numerous train of Absurdities
(besides many, and great, and intolerable Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences)
which have followed the literal acceptation of
the words.</p>
               <p>12. These are a few slight touches upon the
USEFULNESS of Philosophy. They might have
been greatly both multiplied and enlarged. But being
intent upon Brevity, I say no more of that nature.
Only as I go along, give me leave to drop this Note
by the way; What an auspicious Providence is it, that
has made some Persons for several years past, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigably
studious in Philosophy, and has crown'd
their Studies with such happy success! It looks as if
GOD had strange kindness for us, and designed to
enrich and honour this Age with a very choice Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
even with a clearer understanding, not only of
<hi>Nature,</hi> but in <hi>Divinity</hi> it self, than the World has yet
had.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:102637:23"/>
Nor need we wonder that Philosophy should advance
and flourish even among our selves; considering what
encouragement it has lately met with.
For whereas it is recorded by<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

that he erected them into a famous and well-contriv'd
<hi>Society;</hi> that they might be a <hi>ROYAL</hi> one
too, he was pleased to make HIMSELF Their
PATRON and Their HEAD.</p>
               <p>13. Now we being in these hopeful thriving Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
it behoves us to be careful, that it may
not be with us in this Case, as it frequently and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
falls out in others, <hi>That we Abuse not Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi>
which grows so fast and high in noble Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For such is our loose and unruly temper, that
from fulness we commonly run into wantonness, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our rich Plenty into Riot and Excess. It will be
wisdom to restrain or suppress this humour, and to
keep our selves free from its evil predominance: else
our very Remedy may become our Disease; and we
may surfeit and be sick of that wholsom medicine
which the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or great Physician of our Minds,
has given us to help their pitiable Infirmities.</p>
               <p>14. And upon this account of <hi>Abusing</hi> Philosophy,
they are mightily to blame that <hi>Slight</hi> it: I mean,
<hi>by speaking or thinking little and unhandsom things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it.</hi> Too many there are of the <hi>first</hi> Stamp,
that <hi>Speak unbecomingly</hi> of Philosophy. They cry it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102637:24"/>
down as needless, and condemn it as superfluous; and
tell us, there's no cause to trouble our selves about it,
we having an higher and better Doctrine among us,
which came down from Heaven. These are crooked
Reflections, and garishly made, upon no grounds,
and without reason. The language (at best) but of
Prejudice or Ignorance, Mistake or Inadvertency.
For though the Word from Heaven be infinitely
preferible to Humane Learning; yet the one is most
necessary in conjunction with the other: Else we may
believe the Wise GOD would not have given us both:
But since he has done so, it concerns us to take heed
of slighting either. To reject Philosophy upon the
account of Scripture, is just as discreet, as to resolve all
Industry into Providence; and to take no thought in
the least for our selves, because GOD careth for us.
Just as rational as it would be for a Man to throw
away all Candles, because there is a Sun; or to put
one of his Eyes out, because he has two.</p>

sneaking Soul, that is sunk below
the Dignity of his raised <hi>Species;</hi>
and in token of his degeneracy should
write, MAN, no longer. And most justly. For
he that is so silly as to despise Philosophy, does
thereby condemn the improvement of Reason; and
consequently sets his mind against Reason it self,
the specifick perfection, as well as the Crown and
Glory of Humanity. And why should <hi>he</hi> wear the

               <p>15. But besides such <hi>mental</hi> and <hi>verbal</hi> wrongs that
are done to Philosophy, which amount to a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
undervaluing of it: there are also real and <hi>actual
abuses</hi> put upon it, to the unreasonable prejudice of
our selves, and that, while we make it minister to
vanity and extravagance. And this is done <hi>Two</hi> ways
chiefly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>First</hi> is, When we <hi>set it too low,</hi> and depress
it beneath its generous Worth. When we inslave it
to Phansies and ridiculous Whimsies. When we put
it upon the Investigation of things that <hi>are not;</hi> or
if they <hi>be,</hi> are but Smoke and Shadows; not worth
the thinking of, much less the searching after. And
here the <hi>Schools</hi> are more than a little to blame.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102637:25"/>
For they sometimes contend <hi>de lanâ Caprinâ,</hi> about
great and loud nothings: and debate and wrangle
with heat and fierceness, upon the most empty and
frothy Questions. Thus (to instance in the matter
of Angels) they dispute whether an Angel can be
moved <hi>locally</hi> or no. And yet at the same time,
their Philosophy will not admit an Angel <hi>to be in
a place.</hi> And yet they still go on to argue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be moved <hi>from place to place, pertranseundo
media, by passing through the intermediate places.</hi> And
then they farther Query, Whether (if an Angel
moves through intermediate places) it be done, <hi>in
tempore, vel in instanti, in time, or in an instant:</hi> and
so whether he cannot as soon move from one Pole
of the World to the other; as cross a Room not
ten Foot wide. This is to trifle with Philosophy,
to put tricks upon it, or to tantalize it. To starve it
under the pretence of treating it: or to make it a
<hi>Chamelion,</hi> and to feed it with Air. It is perfectly
to ridicule its Gravity: and to turn its Glory into
scorn and contempt. To pull it down from its
glittering and stately Throne of Reason, and to
place it amongst the Vassals or Lacqueys to humor;
by tying it to wait upon empty impertinencies, with
uneasie servility. People that do thus affront and
abuse Philosophy, by ingaging it (as I may say)
in lamentable drudgery; in spinning out thin and
Cobweb notions, in cutting up lean and aiery nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and in searching into such jejune and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Questions; as afford little or nothing worth its
regard; do thereby lessen and degrade <hi>themselves,</hi>
as well as <hi>that.</hi> And that so far, that I know not
how to call them, nor what sufficient names of
Diminution to bestow upon them. They are Sons
of Sophistry, Pragmatical Speculators, Promoters of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102637:26"/>
Subtilties, Metaphysical Brokers, Dissectors of Ideas,
Factors for Levity, and Problematical Coiners. They
are Fanaticks in Philosophy, and Conspirators against
it, and Persecutors of it, and Worms and Moths to
it; and if they chance but to get into its rich Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe,
are for eating and spoiling all that is good
in it. They are Men that seek for Knots in Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rushes;
and if they cannot find them there, will be

they are but Cyphers, or insignificant Persons; idle

is by forcing it upon the contrary extreme. By

a way of solving every <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> almost, by her
own intrinsick force and vertue, by her own esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht
Laws and Conducts; without recourse to
any other Principle or Oeconomy. As if because it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102637:26"/>
does <hi>many</hi> things, it must therefore do <hi>all;</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be wrought without its efficiency. By
which means, it is not only arm'd with an energy,
far above what it can rightfully claim; and presumed
efficacious beyond all its proper Ability can extend
to: but moreover is set up in opposition to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and made to derogate from a Power, that is
infinitely superior to its own; by challenging to its
self, what that alone is able to effect. Or if it be
not made to arrogate so much to it self, as down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
to claim the power of Miracles; yet th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is supposed to intermeddle too far in the working
of them: and so to intrench upon Omnipotence,
where it does not exclude it.</p>
               <p>And therefore that cavilling or captious Objection
against the Philosopher, which <hi>Plato</hi> complains of,
applied to him that runs Philosophy too high, and
attributes too great a virtue to it; may pass for an
allowable Censure, in some measure at least.<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>But they that impute too much to Philosophy,
however they may think they befriend and honour
it; they thereby do it very great disservice. For
while they cry it up more than they ought; they

making nothing more vile and detestable than it.
Even so the easiest and readiest way to depress Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
beneath its true worth, and to bring it
down into disesteem, not to say, into lowest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

betwixt HIM and <hi>Abraham</hi> about it; and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful

Oracles. For so the Hand-maid would pertly usurp
over her Mistress; and forgetting her duty, proudly
domineer in her Station of Obedience.</p>
               <p>17. And this is too much the Fault of <hi>The Theory
of the Earth.</hi> It pends too hard against the Sacred
Scriptures, and advances to an intrenchment upon
Divine Revelation. Which will evidently appear, in
several Particulars, in the Sequel of our Discourse.</p>
               <p>18. It abounds with Philosophy indeed; and the
Philosophy it contains is well delivered. But it is
not justly regulated, and kept within due Limits.
For it runs so fast, and is driven so far, that it treads
unseemly, and unsufferably too, upon the heels of
Truth; even of that most Divine and Infallible Truth
which was spoken by GOD; and therefore to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
reverenc'd of Men.</p>
               <p>19. Now this Irregularity I apprehended so great,
that the reverence I bear to that <hi>Holy Volume,</hi> whose
Cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nts are no other than the Doctrines of Heaven,
ingaged me in drawing up the ensuing <hi>Exceptions,</hi>
and then in publishing them. Though I must own
too, that I was much encouraged in the Undertaking,
by the <hi>Theorist</hi>'s ingenuous and frank Invitation:
<note n="a" place="margin">Theory, pag. 288.</note> 
                  <hi>Whosoever, by solid Reasons, will shew me in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,

and undeceive me, I shall be very much obliged to
him.</hi> This I shall endeavour to do, with all Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and that only as a Friend and Servant to Truth.
And therefore with such Candour, Meekness and
Modesty, as becomes one who assumes and glories
in so fair a Character: And also with such Respect
to the <hi>Virtuosoe</hi> who wrote the <hi>Theory;</hi> as may testifie
to the World, that I esteem his Learning, while I
question his Opinion.</p>
               <p>20. And that our Work may be done with the more
ease and order, it shall be prosecuted in a Method cut
out to our hands; and shaped according to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation
of the <hi>Theory,</hi> which we find set down
in the <hi>Second Book,</hi> and the <hi>Ninth Chapter,</hi> in these
words:</p>
               <p>That there was a Primitive Earth, of another Form
from the present, and inhabited by Mankind till the
Deluge: That it had those Properties and Conditions
that we have ascribed to it, namely, a perpetual Equinox
and Spring, by reason of its right Situation to the Sun;
was of an Oval Figure, and the exterior face of it
smooth and uniform, without Mountains, or a Sea:
That in this Earth stood Paradise, the Doctrine whereof
cannot be understood, but upon Supposition of this Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Earth and its Properties. Then, That the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and Fall of the Earth into the Abyss which
lay under it, was that which made the Vniversal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
and the Destruction of the Old World: And,
That neither <hi>Noah's</hi> Flood, nor the present Form of
the Earth, can be explained in any other Method that is
rational, nor by any other Causes that are intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.
These are the Vitals of the <hi>Theory,</hi> and the
Primary Assertions, whereof I do freely profess my full
Belief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:102637:31"/>
Against these <hi>Assertions,</hi> my <hi>Exceptions</hi> shall be
levelled; and in the same order in which they stand.</p>
               <p>21. So much for the First Chapter; which may
be reckoned as an <hi>Introduction</hi> to the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
Which if any shall look upon as a Collection
of Notes somewhat confusedly put together, rather
than a formal, well digested Treatise, they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the best or truest <hi>Idea</hi> of it.</p>

I mean, that most perfect and glorious
ESSENCE, who gave Being to all; so the Earth,
among the rest, had its Origin likewise. This,
none but Infidels, or Anti-Scripturists, can doubt;
the Article being founded upon no less than Divine,
which is the most firm and unquestionable Evidence.
Could any Doubt of this Matter offer to form it self
in our Minds, and to settle there, the very first Verse
in the Holy Bibl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But then as to the <hi>Way</hi> of the Earth's Formation,
we are more at a Loss, as being not so satisfactorily
instructed concerning it. Here Providence seems to
have left us to our selves; and for the improvement
of both, remits us to the Conduct of Philosophick
Learning, in some measure, and to our own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Only we must be careful that the <hi>Idea</hi>'s we
frame, be congruous to the Truths that came down
from above; and are, or should be the Touchstone
of all <hi>Hypotheses</hi> among Christians. Which, because
the way of the Earth's Formation, according to the
<hi>Theory,</hi> is not; it overthrows the first vital Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which is this, <hi>There was a Primitive Earth of
another Form from the present, and inhabited by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
till the Deluge.</hi> The latter Clause of it, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Earth's being inhabited till the Deluge, we
do not question. The former part of it cannot stand,
by reason the <hi>Manner</hi> of the Earth's Rise, which
the <hi>Theory</hi> ascribes to it, overturns it. It is supposed
to have proceeded thus.</p>
               <p>The whole matter of the Earth and sublunary Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
being confusedly blended together, in one fluid
Mass or <hi>Chaos;</hi> the grosser and heavier parts thereof
sunk down to the middle of it (as to the Centre of
their Gravity) and constituted and interior Orb of
Earth. The rest of the Mass about it, by the same
Principle of Gravity, was divided into two Orders
of Bodies; the one Liquid, and the other Volatile.
The Volatile mounting above the Liquid, constituted
the Air: The liquid mass swimming below (and incircling
the inward Earth aforesaid) contained in it all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
originally belonging to the Earth. These ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Liquors are of two kinds chiefly; either fat,
oily, and light; or else lean, and more earthy. The
lean and earthy Liquor made up the Element of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102637:32"/>
Water: The Oily Liquor (which arose out of
the Water as it purged it self) got above it, and
floated upon it. And so the whole stood as in this
Figure:
<figure>
                     <p>Fig: 1 Pag: 47</p>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>Where 1 denotes the fiery Centre of the Earth.
2. The Interior Orb of the Earth, composed of the
grossest particles of the <hi>Chaos.</hi> 3. The Element of
Water, or the Abyss. 4. The Oyly Liquor upon
the surface of the Water. 5. The Mass or Body
of the Air.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:102637:33"/>
But this Body of the Air being at first very muddy
and impure, through abundance of terrestrial Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
that, as fast as they could free themselves
from the Air with which they were mingled, and in
which they were intangled, they sunk downward:
And meeting, in their descent, with the Oyly Liquor
on the face of the Deep, there they stuck; and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating
with that unctious Substance, made a certain
Slime; or a fat, soft, light Earth, spread upon the
Waters: Which growing thicker and thicker, by a
continual accession of more terrestrial Particles, sliding
down still out of the Air, as it purify'd it self; at
last it came to its just Dimensions. And then waxing
more dry and stiff, and firm and solid, in fine it
attained to its due Consistency, and so became the
First habitable Earth.</p>
               <p>Thus have I briefly, but, I hope, truly represented
the <hi>Manner</hi> of the Primitive Earth's Formation. If
there be any thing of Mistake in the Description, it
is altogether involuntary. But I think I have spoken
the very mind of the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> as it is more<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. chap. 5.</note> largely
set down by the <hi>Theorist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But if the Primitive Earth's being of another
Form, does depend upon its rising in such a method
as this, as indeed it does; then it could not be of
another Form from the present Earth, because it
could not rise in such a manner, for several Reasons. As</p>
               <p>First, Because <hi>it would have taken too long time in
doing it.</hi> A longer time by much, than that Divine
Account we have of its Origination, does mention, or
will allow. For to say nothing how long the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Earth would have been in forming, by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding
of the grossest parts of the <hi>Chaos</hi> to the Centre
of it; till which were sunk, the other Sedimentals
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102637:33"/>
could not so well have separated: And to say nothing
how considerable a space of time it would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
for the Aereal Matter to have clarify'd it self,
and to have setled in its proper Region: And to say
nothing of the Lastingness of that other Purgation,
whereby the liquid part of the <hi>Chaos</hi> would have
sent forth its Oyliness to invest the Waters, to receive
those Dregs that fell out of the Air: To say nothing
of these; how much time must have been spent, in
producing the exterior Orb of the Earth, which was
to be made up of those terrestrial Particles which
fell from above, and rested upon the Oyly out-side
of the Deep? Should these fine Particles have showred
down, as fast as ever we saw small Rain or Snow do;
yet how many Days and Weeks must have passed,
before they could have swell'd into so huge a Body
as the Earth was at first? I say, as the Earth was
at first. For according to the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> now before
us, the Primitive Earth was bigger than this: So
much bigger, as to take all that space into its Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
which reacheth up to the tops of the highest
Mountains at least. Yea, if the first Earth did not
fill a <hi>much</hi> bigger space than that (as it might do; for
according to this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> we know not how far its
Circumference might extend) yet a space <hi>somewhat</hi> big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
it must needs occupy, in regard the
Mountains are now worn<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>lower</hi> than
they were. And for such inconceivable
Quantities of little Particles, to descend
out of the Air, as would be sufficient
to make such a bulky Globe as the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Earth, must necessarily be a
<hi>good whiles</hi> work. And so it is expresly
acknowledged to be (<hi>Theor.</hi> p. 58, 59.)
And then if as fast as they showred down into the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102637:34"/>
Oyly Substance, they did immediately mix and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
with it; yet then it would take up some time
again, to dry and harden this new made Earth, and
to reduce it to an habitable Consistency. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its Formation this way, could by no means fall
in with the <hi>real</hi> time of its Production. Nay, it
could not be compleated in that space of time, in
which GOD declares that he began and finisht the
whole Creation.</p>
               <p>3. For that glorious Work is expresly limited to
<hi>Six Days.</hi> And every Day has its respective Task
particularly specified and appropriated to it. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
more might be created on some Days, than is
mentioned, as Angels, Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet we may be sure
there was no less. Not but that GOD could have done
all in one Day, if he had so pleased, or in one Hour,
or Minute: As he could also have given Being to the
World, many millions of Ages before He did. But
it was not his Will that it should exist sooner; and
his Will it was, that the Creation of it should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
to an <hi>Hexaemeron,</hi> or Six Days Work, and
therefore he drew it out to that length. But then
when <hi>Philo Iudaeus,</hi> St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and others, teach that
the World was created in an <hi>Instant;</hi> we have no
reason, <hi>jurare in verba,</hi> to give up our selves to a
Belief of their Doctrine. Nor is the Saying of the Son
of <hi>Syrach</hi> (sometimes alleged in Proof of the Opinion)
to be at all regarded;<note n="b" place="margin">Ecclus. 18. 1</note> 
                  <hi>He that liveth for ever,
creavit omnia simul, created all things together:</hi> As if
he created them together <hi>in the same moment.</hi> Whereas
(besides that the Book is <hi>Apocryphal</hi>) the <hi>Greek</hi> Copy
reads it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>He created all things <hi>in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
                  </hi>
as well one as other; in which sense it relates
to no time. And accordingly our <hi>English</hi> is most
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102637:34"/>
proper, <hi>he created all things <hi>in general.</hi>
                  </hi> Yet this
Apocryphal Text seems to be the chief ground upon
which St. <hi>Austin</hi> built his Opinion of the World's
being made in an instant.</p>
               <p>But by that Account which <hi>Moses</hi> gives in, the Earth
brought forth Grass, and Herbs, and Trees, on the<note n="c" place="margin">Gen 1. 12, 13.</note>
                  <hi>Third Day,</hi> even before there was a Sun. Which as it
proves that GOD's special Hand was in the Work
(and might serve as a Bridle to curb People in their
forwardness to idolize the Sun; while it is made plain
to them, that he did not, as a DEITY, give Being to
these thing by any plastick influence of his, they
existing before himself) so it argues withal, that the
Earth was then grown into a competent Solidity.
Yea, the same <hi>Moses</hi> goes on, and tells the World,
That by the end of <hi>three days</hi> more the Earth was
made a <hi>Dwelling-place</hi> for Mankind, and in part of it,
a <hi>Paradisiacal</hi> one too. And this farther bespeaks it
to have arrived at such a Temperament, as it could
never have done so soon, in case it had been formed
as is above supposed. For besides that the <hi>Theory</hi>
allows it to have <hi>become dry by degrees,</hi> after it had <hi>done
growing;</hi> it declares, That <hi>the Body or new Concretion</hi>
of it was <hi>encreased daily, being fed and supplied both
from above and below</hi> (pag. 59.) At which rate, Six
Days might easily pass, and Six times Six after them;
and the Earth not be fitted for Habitation.</p>
               <p>4. And though the Sun was not made as yet (the
Fourth Day being the first of his existence) yet this
does not invalidate <hi>Moses</hi>'s Narrative in the least, by
rendring it absurd, or inconsistent with it self, when
it tells us that the Earth was brought to such maturity
on the <hi>Third Day.</hi> For though there was no Sun
then, yet we are assured there was Light: And Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102637:35"/>
might so order this Light, as to have it supply
the place of the Sun, in measuring out Time, and
making Days, though not so distinctly as he does.</p>
               <p>And that there should be Light, before there was
a perfect Sun, seems highly agreeable to the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Light by the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Principles. For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them, Light consists <hi>in pressione materiae coelestis,
in a pressure of the celestial matter;</hi> or, <hi>in conatu ejus
ad motum,</hi> in its <hi>tendency</hi> or <hi>nitency to motion.</hi>
And therefore if our <hi>Vortex,</hi> or Heaven (made up of
this Matter) were by the first Mover put into such
a Circumgyration at the beginning, as it now has;
by virtue of this Gyration, the subtile Matter would
have been impregnated with a strong <hi>conatus</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity
to recede from the Centre of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws of Motion well known in that
case. And so a faint Light would have been cast
through the <hi>Vortex,</hi> at least through the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> parts
thereof, though there had been no Sun in the middle of
the same. And so while the Matter for the Body of the
Sun had been in preparing (that is, grinding off from
the particles of the Matter of the Second Element;
which being made to turn upon their own <hi>Axes,</hi> by
mutual collision, and incessant attrition, rounded one
another into Spherical Figures) and gathering towards
the middle Point of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> and setling there;
a feeble kind of Light must have shat from those
Central parts of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> till the Sun thus a making
could have been finisht. Which is it might have
been in the space of <hi>three</hi> Days (by a great quantity
of the purest Matter retiring into the heart of the
<hi>Vortex,</hi> which still grew bigger, as the Particles of
the Second Element had their angulosities worn off,
and so grew less) then on the <hi>fourth</hi> Day, the Sun
might shine out in his full strength. While by a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102637:35"/>
new Protrusion, and brisker Propulsion of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bular
Matter, he put a stronger <hi>conatus</hi> into it than
it had before.</p>
               <p>And if there could thus have been <hi>Light</hi> ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently
to the Sun; then how there should be <hi>Days</hi>
and <hi>Nights</hi> at the same time, is easie to conceive, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the Diurnal Motion of the Earth.</p>
               <p>This I have said, not that I belive the Sun was
thus produced (any more than the Great

appear, that the holy Text might be
literally true; and that to hold there
were Days before there was a Sun, is
so far from being vulgar and ridiculous

though there were no manner of force in

               <p>5. But that the whole Creation, and consequently
the whole Earth, was consummated in <hi>six days</hi> may
he proved by one very good Argument, the <hi>Fourth
Precept</hi> in the most sacred Decalogue: <hi>Remember that
thou keep holy the Sabbath-day. Six days shalt thou
labour, and do all that thou hast to do; but the seventh
day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy GOD. In it thou
shalt do no manner of work, thou, and thy son, and thy
daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, thy
cattel, and the stranger that is within thy gates. For
in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea,
and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day.
Wherefore the LORD blessed the seventh day, and hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
it.</hi> Now the <hi>Seventh</hi> day, which by divine
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102637:36"/>
Benediction, and special Consecration, was set apart
for the <hi>Iewish Sabbath,</hi> was no other than a <hi>Natural</hi>
Day, consisting of Twenty four Hours. And the
<hi>six Days</hi> in which God allowed Men to work, were
of the same quality or duration. But then he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
labour six Days in the Week, because in six
Days he made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all
that in them is; and enjoyning a cessation from all
manner of work, and a Sanctification of the Seventh
Day, because on it he rested from his work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
from hence it will follow by undeniable
consequence, that the <hi>seventh Day</hi> on which GOD
rested, and the <hi>six Days</hi> on which he wrought, must
be of the same nature that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sabbath and
Week-days were of; and that in <hi>Six</hi> such <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
or <hi>Natural</hi> Days, consisting of Twenty four Hours
apiece, the Heaven, the Earth, the Sea, and all that
in them is, were made.</p>
               <p>And indeed unless the HOLY GHOST had said
expresly that they were <hi>Natural</hi> Days, each of them
made up of Twenty four Hours, he could hardly
have spoken them to be <hi>such,</hi> more plainly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
than he has done. For he tells us <hi>seven</hi> times
over (in the First of <hi>Genesis)</hi> that is, concerning
every one of the seven Days, That they had <hi>Evening</hi> and
<hi>Morning</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Whereas if he had made
use of the single word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>that</hi> might have been taken
for <hi>time</hi> indefinitely or at large. But as if he designed
to prevent this, or at least to give no occasion for it;
as often as he mentioned <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> he was still pleased to
tack <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to it; to evidence that he meant
no other than a <hi>Natural</hi> Day, to which <hi>Evening</hi> and
<hi>Morning</hi> do belong.</p>
               <p>And that which makes it farther evident, that he
has tied up <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Day,</hi> to signifie a <hi>Natural</hi> Day, in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102637:37"/>
the Story of the Creation, is, That this <hi>Fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is partly entred in that Story; and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>the Seventh Day,</hi> which he blessed and sanctified for
the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> is said to be the seventh Day on which
he rested from his works. And so both were Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Days alike, the one as much as the other. And
therefore the Seventh Day separated for a Sabbath, and
kept so by the <hi>Iews</hi> (from the Promulgation of the
Law, to the Dissolution of their Polity, yea, to this
very Hour, in their Dispersion) being a true <hi>Natural</hi>
Day, the <hi>Seventh</hi> Day whereon GOD rested from his
works must be the same.</p>
               <p>And truly once to pretend that there is any thing
of Cloudiness or Ambiguity in the recited Precept;
or that GOD by the Days mentioned therein, did not
mean ordinary <hi>Natural</hi> Days; would be to raise a
mist to darken the Truth; to offer to tye a knot,
where there really is none; and to put plain words
<hi>by</hi> their common sense, meerly to force a difficulty
into them. Suppose a Man should command his
Servants or Children to work six Days, because he
himself in six Days had done such and such things;
and to rest on the seventh Day, because on that Day
he ceased from his labours: Could it ever enter into
the thoughts of any, but that the Days in which he
wrought, and they are to work; and the Day in
which he rested, and they are to rest, must be of the
same nature? Why, such is the case here, if we put
but the Great GOD into the place of that Man, and
allow his Precept to be of a plain import and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
as we have reason to do. For this Great
God was now publishing a Law to his People: A Law
whereby they were to live, or die for ever: A Law
by which he really intended, and heartily desired,
that they should not die, but live to Eternity. And
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102637:37"/>
He being in hand with a Law of such consequence
to their pretious Souls, who can question but it was
worded plainly? For without doubt he would deliver
it in such familiar terms, as might be most intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
to the meanest Capacities amongst that
People, to whom he recommended it as a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rule. So that the Fourth Commandment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a piece of that Rule, a Branch of that Law,
we cannot suppose it to be cloathed with obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
either in the substance or reason of it. And
truly if so plain a Paragraph as that be not to be taken
in its Grammatical sense, 'tis impossible we should
know the Mind of Scripture, and vain it will be
to pretend to understand any Period in it. But then,
if where God speaks plainly in his Word, we must
understand it Literally; surely we must do it most
of all, in that part of his Word which is the Body of
his Law, and so the specifick Rule of our Practice.
And if the Moral Law in general was of a Literal
Signification; then so was the <hi>Fourth Word</hi> of it to
the <hi>Iews.</hi> And if <hi>that</hi> were Literally to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
as undoubtedly it was, the World must be
created in the time there specified, in just <hi>Six Days,</hi>
that is, neither more nor fewer.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> methinks seems to be mightily concern'd
to ground Men in this. For though he had noted
already in the First of <hi>Genesis,</hi> that the work of
Creation was compleated in Six Days; and had
fairly accounted for each of them in particular: yet
reviewing things in the Second Chapter, he there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates
the same afresh, that so they might take
farther notice of it. <hi>Thus the Heavens and the Earth
were finished, and all the Host of them.</hi> That is, in
the Days, and according to the order before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.
But had the Earth been formed after
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102637:38"/>
the tenor of this new Hypothesis, it could never
have been finisht in <hi>Six Days,</hi> and brought into a
condition sit to entertain its Host Creatures, in that
compass of time. Unless at the rate of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi>
Miracle, we should yield that the Showers of
Earthly Particles, were hardened by instantaneous
induration. For so it is storied of a certain <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vich,</hi>
or monkish <hi>Musselman,</hi> that strowing Sand
upon the Waves, as fast as he sprinkled it, it turn'd
to a Causey before him, whereon he might walk
to a <hi>Mosque,</hi> the usual place of his Devotions.
Though far more agreeable to this <hi>Hypothsis</hi> (as it
makes the Formation of the Earth so slow) is the
Phantasie of the <hi>Chineses,</hi> inhabiting <hi>Formosa</hi> and
other Islands. Who hold that the World, when
first created, was without form or shape: but by
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Atlas Chin.</hi> part 2. pag. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>Pankun,</hi> one of their Demi-gods, (the <hi>Sixty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
of their <hi>Seventy Two</hi> Deities) was brought to
its full perfection in Four Years.</p>
               <p>6. The only considerable way of eluding this
Doctrine of the Worlds being made in <hi>Six Days;</hi> is
the introducing of <hi>Cabbalism</hi> into the Story of the
Creation. For by <hi>That,</hi> Numbers, which show the
order of time are made Types or Emblems, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Notes of the Natures of things. But the force
of the Holy Argument alleged, is not to be shifted
off by this means. The <hi>Iews,</hi> without question,
had a <hi>Cabbala</hi> amongst them; and upon this <hi>Cabbala</hi>
they set an exceeding high value. For they put it
in the Scales (as some Christians now a-days do
Tradition) even against the written Word it self.
So that known saying witnesseth, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
                  <hi>the words of the</hi> Cabbala, <hi>and the words of

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102637:38"/>
might agree with that true and ancient <hi>Cabbala,</hi>
which they had from <hi>Moses,</hi> and in part from
<hi>Adam,</hi> as<note n="†" place="margin">Reuchlin. de A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> some think; it suits not their present

                  <hi>Cunaeus</hi> bestows a

sitting character; where he declares it to be <hi>full of
trifles,</hi> &amp;c. Though <hi>Mirandula</hi> on the other side,
crys it up as much (if the same) in his <hi>Apology:</hi>
where he avers it to have been first committed to
writing by <hi>Esdras.</hi> But that which I would note
is <hi>this,</hi> That the genuine <hi>Cabbala</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
overthrow that strength of Argument, in the
<hi>Fourth Commandment,</hi> for the Worlds being made in
the space of <hi>Six Days.</hi> The Reason follows.</p>
               <p>7. The Cabbalizing <hi>Iews,</hi> even after the purity
of Oral Tradition was lost amongst them, were
still hugely careful to deliver nothing, but what was
consistent with the Literal sense of Scripture. So
that it treating of any Period of it, they did but
orderly proceed from one sense to another: and
their <hi>Traditional</hi> sense was to be so far from being
repugnant or destructive to the <hi>Verbal</hi> one; that it
was to comply with it, and to be subordinate to
it.</p>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>The Style of the Scripture

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>The Scripture
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102637:39"/>
departs not from its simple and literal meaning.</hi> It was
delivered by that eminent Man for Learning, <hi>R. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Iarchi (Praefat in Cantic.)</hi> Not that he meant
Sripture is <hi>always</hi> to be kept to a <hi>literal</hi> sense only;
the very words wherewith he ushers in that Rule,
sufficiently declare the contrary; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>One Scripture may be drawn out into many senses.</hi>
And therefore he only meant, that the <hi>literal sense</hi>
of Scripture is not to be thrown off, or taken away,
by, or for <hi>any other.</hi> And <hi>R. Moses bar Nachman</hi>
lays down the same Rule. To which several other
<hi>Rabbies</hi> also do consent; particularly <hi>Menasseh ben Israel,</hi>
who in his First Book concerning the <hi>Resurrection of
the Dead,</hi> says, <hi>That Scripture is always to be understood
and explained according to the <hi>Letter,</hi> unless where such
an Explication implies a contradiction.</hi> According to
which <hi>Axioms</hi> of the Learned, what ever sense might be
superinduc'd to the Text, they were still to adhere (so far
as Reason would suffer) to the <hi>literal</hi> one. Yet where
they were reconcilable, and could fairly be coincident,
they were both allowed. And therefore when in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
some have been high for the <hi>Letter;</hi> and
others hot for the Allegory or <hi>Cabbala;</hi> the difference
betwixt them has been frequently accommodated, by
pronouncing that <hi>Talmudic</hi> Sentence, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
By which concession of a complicated
sense in the word or clause, that ministred occasion
of fierce Dispute, the contending Parties have both
been quickly and fully satisfied. And well they might;
for by the easie Umpirage of that soft and moderative
Saying, they were immediately brought to equal terms,
and set, as I may say, upon even ground. For each
of them had warranty to maintain their own Opinion,
and liberty to acquiesce therein respectively. Though

                  <hi>When the</hi> Cabbalistic Exposition <hi>is contrary to
the literal or received sense, no account is made of it,
but the</hi> foundation <hi>rests in the common sense or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Quando verò ei subordinatur, &amp;c. But when it is
subordinate to it, and consistent with it, and</hi> both <hi>may be

               <p>And such a mixt or compound sense of Letter and

to be in the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Cosmology, or the Story
of the World's Creation. Besides its common, humble,
obvious sense, which lies bare to view, and offers

it big with another more occult and remote, and
also more sublime than that; where the Kernel of
Mystery lay close shut up, <hi>sub cortice verborum,</hi> under
the Husk of plain and ordinary words. And for this

                  <hi>Vnless one has attained to the Age of
Priests when they enter on their Ministry, that is, to
thirty years, he is not suffered, with them, to read the
Beginning of</hi> Genesis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then if the <hi>Iews,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their <hi>Mysterious,</hi> always held a <hi>literal</hi> sense
in Scripture (where it can take place) and also kept
this Mysterious sense of theirs from breaking in upon
the Literal, and doing violence to it; according to
their own recited Rules: from hence it is manifest,
that the World might be Created in just <hi>six Days,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:102637:40"/>
for all their <hi>Cabbala,</hi> or the numbers in it. And when
<hi>they</hi> kept the <hi>Cabbala</hi> within such bounds, <hi>Christians</hi>
have no reason to stretch it farther; for they have it
but from <hi>them,</hi> or rather (as to the <hi>Numeral</hi> part of
it) from one that had it (or is presumed to have had
it) from them, I mean, <hi>Pythagoras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. But grant (what by no means is to be granted)
that there were a <hi>Cabbalistic</hi> sense in the Story of the
Creation, so venerable and excellent, as to be allowed
to supersede the <hi>literal</hi> one quite, or to swallow up
the same; and that the <hi>Mosaic Number's</hi> there, were
not at all intended to distinguish <hi>time,</hi> but only to
shadow out the <hi>Natures</hi> of things; and so no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
Proof could be fetcht from thence, of the
World's being compleated in <hi>six Days:</hi> Yet still the
Holy Argument produced, would hold good; because
in that Divine Precept there can be no <hi>Cabbalism</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive
of its <hi>literal</hi> meaning. And that for these
Three Reasons.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Because GOD must then have put dark Mystery
into the heart of his Law.</hi> Into that part of it which
(that it might be sure to be most plain, as well as
authentick) he was pleased to write with his own
Finger. Into that part of it which every poor
<hi>Israelite</hi> newly come out of Egyptian Bondage, was
to practise. And therefore it was necessary he should
understand it, and consequently that there should not
be obscurity in it: A thing ever held incongruous to
Laws (as very unsuitable to their Use and End) and
always declined by wise Legislators. For they have
still been careful that the Statutes drawn up and enacted
by them, should carry a clear sense along with them
both in their Injunctions, and the Reasons of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:102637:40"/>
Secondly, <hi>Because then something of Duty expressed
in the Commandment, would have been very improperly
and incompetently urged.</hi> That Men should work six
Days in the Week, because in six Days GOD cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
the World, upon each of them bringing some
considerable Pieces of it into being, is most fit and
reasonable: Even as fit and reasonable as it is for
mean Persons to imitate their Superior; for Creatures
to follow the great Example of their Maker. But
that Men should labour six Days in the Week, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Number <hi>Six</hi> is the Character of the Nature
of any Creatures, would be altogether empty, trifling
and impertinent, as admitting no manner of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
or connection betwixt the Reason and the
Thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Because it would shuffle and jumble the
Natures of things together, or else bring a strange
Confusion into the Numbers of the Cabbala.</hi> It would
<hi>shuffle the Natures of things together,</hi> in an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
manner. For thus the Heavens and the Earth
(as the Commandment runs) the Sea, and all that
in them is (which according to the Physical <hi>Cabbala</hi>
of <hi>Moses,</hi> are thought to have their Orders, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Natures, distinctly characterized by several
Numbers) must be here referred to <hi>one single</hi> Number
<hi>Six.</hi> And <hi>That,</hi> according to other Numbers (for

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102637:41"/>
which would intollerably confound the Natures of
Beings.</p>
               <p>Or else, which would <hi>bring strange confusion into the
Numbers of the</hi> Cabala; this one, the <hi>Senary,</hi> must in
power be equal to all the rest. That is, it must
denote what the <hi>Vnite, Binary, Ternary,</hi> &amp;c. are
supposed to do; and so signifie Spiritual, and Material
Beings; Terrestrial, and Aquatick Animals; Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and Inanimate things, all at once. But to
stretch it out to such a comprehensive Symbolical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as to make it an Hieroglyphick of the Universe,
and of all things in it: might seem to be a violent
straining it, beyond its just Latitude. Especially if
we consider, that the rest of the Numbers before
it, are all conceived to be fitted and restrained, to
the shadowing out such and such <hi>single</hi> Natures:
and none of them allowed to be of so wide a signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy,
as to have a Mystical reference to all the
Creatures.</p>
               <p>Though truly if any witty busie <hi>Calbalists,</hi> should
either out of the Nature or Names of <hi>this</hi> Number;
extort such meanings, as might make it seem an
Emblem of the whole Creation, as to its production,
compleatment, or the like: we need not be much
surprized at it. For no wonder that they should
so vex (as I may say) and Wire-draw Numbers,
as to force and wind them even to what they please;
when they have power to put any commune word
upon the Rack, and to torment it at such a rate,
as to make it say what they list. <hi>Mirandula</hi> proves
this by a pregnant Instance. For in his Exposition
of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (at the end of his <hi>Heptaplus</hi>)
which signifies no more than, <hi>in the beginning:</hi>
he does so toss and transpose the several Letters and
Syllables of it; and so ransack, and squeeze, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102637:42"/>
torture it; as to make it speak all this long Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
<hi>Pater in Filio &amp; per Filium principium &amp;
finem sive quietem creavit caput ignem &amp; funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
magni hominis foedere bono.</hi> They that would
know the sense of it, let them consult the Author.
By it he designs, <hi>gustum dare</hi> Mosaicae <hi>profunditatis,
To give a taste of</hi> Moses<hi>'s profoundness.</hi> But should
any attempt (in imitation of him) to interpret <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses's</hi>
whole Story of the Creation; as he has done
the first word of it: they would certainly find
<hi>Moses</hi> to be profound indeed; and themselves to
have lanched out into such a deep as would prove
to have neither bottom nor bounds in it. And yet
the Noble <hi>Picus</hi>'s way, is but <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>three</hi> ways
of Cabbalizing by <hi>Permutation:</hi> and <hi>Permutation</hi> it
self, or the <hi>Transposing</hi> of words, is but <hi>one Sort</hi> of
the <hi>Speculative Cabbala</hi> neither. For beside <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
there are other two kinds of it, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
So that according as <hi>Cabbalists</hi> have been, either for
laudable phantasie and ingenuity; or else for humor
and extravagance: they have had as large Fields to
expatiate in, as they could desire. But I must not
digress too far.</p>
               <p>By what has been said, I hope it is evident, that
in the Fourth Commandment, there can be no
<hi>Cabbalistick</hi> meaning, at least none <hi>destructive</hi> to the
<hi>literal</hi> one. Whence it will follow, that the whole
Creation was begun, carried on, and consummated,
in <hi>Six Days:</hi> the thing I was to prove. So that

be false. And the History he wrote of it, as the

9. It is manifest also that <hi>Moses</hi> in that sacred
Story, did not make use of <hi>meer Numbers,</hi> but of
<hi>Time:</hi> yea, of time divided into know and common
Periods; namely, into <hi>Days.</hi> And those <hi>Days</hi> (which is
especially to be noted) are expressed (as was said before,
and must always be remembred) by <hi>Evenings</hi> and
<hi>Mornings;</hi> just as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> speak <hi>Natural</hi> Days.
And therefore not to allow the <hi>First, Second,</hi> and

Natural</hi> Days having Evenings and

One, Two, Three,</hi> &amp;c. is highly unwarrantable; as
being a double injury to Scripture, upon no necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
account. For it is a depriving it of its direct
and genuine sense; and a forcing it upon another
quite beyond and beside that, only to gratifie the
humour of <hi>Cabbalists.</hi> Which humour or phantasie
of theirs, many times is vain and trivi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be rejected. For indeed it proclaims its own <hi>van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
in one notable Instance: I mean, in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidence</hi>
of its Numbers, as to their <hi>symbolical sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy.</hi>
In the whole Story of the Creation, there
are but <hi>Seven</hi> Numbers made use of. Now if
GOD, or <hi>Moses,</hi> had designed these Numbers for
a Mysterious use; we need not question but care
would have been taken, that <hi>Two</hi> of them should not

that there is such a <hi>Cabbala</hi> as some contend

this vanity or superfluity in it. For then the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>Five,</hi> and the Number <hi>Six,</hi> in their Mystical

the <hi>Animal Nature.</hi>

               <p>How the <hi>Senary</hi> is an Emblem of that, both by its

Earth</hi> is contrary to that sense, or not agreeing with
it; it is to be look't upon all the way, as contrary
to Scripture, and disagreeing with <hi>That.</hi> Not that
I deny there is Mystery in the Story of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for undoubtedly there is a great deal, and
that so deep, that it is hard to see to the bottom of
it. But once again I say, (to prevent my being
mistaken) That no <hi>Mystical</hi> or <hi>Cabbalistic</hi> sense is to
be approved of, that overthrows or nulls the <hi>Literal</hi>
one. And the reason is plain; because if the <hi>Literal</hi>
sense should be taken away, it would cease to be
an History: and also could have nothing of fixed or
certain meaning in it; but might be moulded any
way, and changed into every thing, according to
the various apprehensions of Men and their working
Phantasies.</p>
               <p>13. Let me here cast in this as an Overplus.
Where Scripture delivers it self so as not to be lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
interpreted; it is <hi>sometimes</hi> done out of greater
plainness that it affects, and the better to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
it self to our capacity. Thus when it expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

GOD's power, or his doing any thing; by
<hi>Hands.</hi> His Knowledge, or Observation of any thing;
by <hi>Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. It is meerly in way of Condescention to
us, and to render what it speaks of, more easie and
familiar to our apprehension. Here therefore that
Axiome of the <hi>Talmudists,</hi> remembred by great
<hi>Maimonides,</hi> takes place, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>1. AS every Building must have a sutable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
so fit it is that the Earth should
have such a one; It being not only a stately Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
in it self, but moreover designed, at the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of it, to be the Mansion or Dwelling of a
World of Creatures. And it being destined to so
great and noble an use, what pity had it been that
it should have miscarried in the making, and have sunk
into Ruines, while it was setting up, for want of
a sufficient foundation to support it? Yet had it been
built after the manner aforesaid, perhaps there would
have been no less defect in the Architecture of it, than
the want of a meet Foundation. For it was to be
reared upon the Waters risen out of the <hi>Chaos;</hi> and
were they fit to bear such a mighty Pile? I mean
in regard of their unsteadiness and constant Fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:102637:46"/>
That the Earth might be spread, and by degrees
raised upon them; Was it not requisite that they
should be of a quiet and even surface? Otherwise it
may be the unctious Substance could not have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
upon <hi>them,</hi> nor the Earthly Particles hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

settled upon <hi>that.</hi> But the incontinuity of the one
(i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> being broken by the motion of the Waters)
leaving many open spaces to the other; through
those spaces they would have sunk right down to
the bottom of the Deep, and no Earth would have
been produced.</p>
               <p>2. Yet that those Waters were quiescent and
even, upon due examination will hardly be found.
For the <hi>Chaos</hi> in the beginning was turned about
upon its own Center; else how comes the Earth
to be so now? And if it was carried about by such
a Gyration, how could the face of its Waters be still
and equable? Not that I mean they were disturbed
by the meer Rotation of the <hi>Chaos</hi> neither; but by
something else in conjunction with <hi>that,</hi> namely,
The bulky presence of the Moon. For if she was
then placed, where now she is, what hindred but
she might have the same Motion which now she
has? And if she moved then in an <hi>Eliptic</hi> Circle
about the <hi>Chaos,</hi> as now she does about the Earth
(as in all reason she should; the <hi>Chaos</hi> being then
situate, where the Earth is now, betwixt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars;</hi> from which situation that
<hi>Eliptic</hi> Circle results) would not the Waters have
been too much discomposed thereby, to have been
a fit Foundation for the primitive Earth.</p>
               <p>Indeed they being in all places of an equal depth,
and flowing freely without resistance; it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the Tides then were less fierce and rough,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102637:46"/>
than they are now. And yet they all making but
one Sea, and that being open and exposed to the
Moon; it is as probable again, that they swelled
extreamly, and went mighty high. Now the Moon
squeezing them her self (by streightning the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens)
on one side of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> whereever she was (as
at her <hi>Zenith</hi> suppose) and occasioning a like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of them on the opposite side (or at her
<hi>Nadir:</hi>) and the <hi>Chaos</hi> still turning round upon its
own <hi>axis</hi> every Four and Twenty hours: from hence
it follows that these Waters felt the force of two
Tides, in every such space of time. Now where
they Ebbed end Flowed so frequently and incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
must not their Aestuation have been so turbulent,
as to have hindred the gathering, or dissolved the
continuity of the Oily Matter; and so have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the Earth's superstruction upon it?</p>
               <p>In case it be urged, That the Unctious Matter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the face of the Waters, was so very thick, as
that they might heave and sink under it, as there
was occasion, and never break it: I answer, When
this Oily Substance did first arise, it must needs be
thin, and so apt to be broken and divided; and
<hi>that</hi> being disjoined, the Earthly Particles falling in
at the void spaces, would have sunk directly (as
was said even now) through the Waters, having
nothing to support them. And then (which is
farther considerable) the heaviest Particles of Earth,
descending at the same time, in far great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st plenty
(the Air being then fullest of impurity, and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it self most freely) they would have come down
so fast, and in so great abundance, as easily to have
overpowered the thin Oily Scum on which they fell;
and being a little soaked in it, and incorporate with
it, have weighed it down in Flakes to the bottom
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102637:47"/>
of the Waters; upon the top of which it could no
longer float, as being overloaded with the heaviness
of the imbodied Earth. And truly the flowing of
the Waters with a strong head now this way; and
their returning by and by with as much force the
contrary way: must needs put them into such rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
agitations and cross commotions, as would
have much promoted the diving of the Flakes
aforesaid.</p>
               <p>Nor are we to measure the motion of the Chaotic
Waters, from the present great Seas. For however
<hi>they</hi> may be less discomposed by Tides, yet nature <hi>then,</hi>
was in other circumstances (according to the <hi>Theory</hi>)
than it is <hi>now;</hi> and those Waters might be moved at
another rate, than these are. For our present Earth
was at that time all dispersed in the Air. And the
thicker and fuller the Air was, the stronger pressure
would the Moon make upon that; and that again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Waters: and consequently
the higher must the Tides rise, and the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
must they be.</p>
               <p>And then the <hi>Theory</hi> makes another motion in the
Chaotick Waters necessary, namely, A Defluxion of
them from the <hi>Aequator</hi> towards the <hi>Sides</hi> or <hi>Poles</hi> of
the liquid Globe; in order to the forming it (and
consequently the Earth to be raised on it) into an
<hi>Oval Figure.</hi> And this motion might create a new
disturbance in that Element. Yea, not only so, but
it might moreover be fatal to the rise of the Earth.

                  <hi>the watry Globe was to grow oblong, by the
slowing down of the Waters to the sides</hi> (they are
the words of the <hi>Theory) and the disburthening the

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102637:47"/>
these Waters did thus recede or discharge themselves
from about the <hi>Aequator</hi> or middle of the Globe, and
flow down to the sides of it; how easily might the
Oily Matter have followed their course? Yea, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
how necessary was it for it to do so? While
the uppermost Waters thereabouts being most hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and most at liberty; would have fallen back,
and carried that away with them. But then if the
upper Waters thus drew off, and the Oily substance
slid away upon them, what foundation could the
Earth have had in those middle parts we speak of?
Especially if these Waters continued their course for
any time; as it was needful they should to bring
about the effect mentioned. For so vast a body of
Waters, as that of the Abyss, could not by this

or <hi>oblong</hi> Figure, on a sudden.</p>
               <p>3. But in reference to this matter, there is a <hi>Dou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t</hi>
made by the <hi>Theorist,</hi> which must be considered
and removed. Otherwise most of what has been
said, touching the instability and fluctuation of these
Waters, will be vain and groundless. The <hi>Doubt</hi>
is,<note n="a" place="margin">Theor. <hi>pag.</hi> 241.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether the Moon were then in our neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>
And truly I had almost said, he might next
have questioned, <hi>whether the Sun were then in our
Heaven:</hi> there being in the Story of the Creation,
no better evidence for the one, than for the other.
I confess the suggestion (as wild as it is) would
have done the <hi>Arcadians</hi> a great kindness. For they
used to boast of (what was always a Riddle and
nonsense to the Wife) their being more ancient
than <hi>Iupiter</hi> and the <hi>Moon.</hi> So says <hi>Ovid:</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:102637:48"/>
                  <q>

                  </q>
But the service it might have done them, as to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant
brag, will by no means countervail that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
which it does to the person who raises the
Doubt. For it involves him in the guilt of unhappy
temerity towards the Holy Writings: Yet the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orist</hi>
does not only start this Scruple, but argues for
it thus,<note n="b" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Her presence seems to have been less
needful; when there were no long Winter-nights, nor
the great Pool of the Sea to move or govern.</hi> Too
bold an affront to Scripture.</p>
               <p>That says expresly, That GOD made TWO
great Lights; and both upon the Fourth Day,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 16. The <hi>Theorist</hi> suspects he made but
<hi>One.</hi> And truly let him but allow <hi>Two</hi> to be made,
and the <hi>Moon</hi> of necessity must be come into our
Neighbourhood; because she alone could be a
<hi>Great</hi> light in the neighbouring Heaven, to make
up the Sun, <hi>Two.</hi> There is no bringing any <hi>Star</hi>
into the Number. For though the smallest of them
be <hi>a truer</hi> and <hi>greater</hi> Light than the <hi>Moon;</hi> yet
no one of them, was ever a <hi>great</hi> Light in this
lower World: and GOD created more than <hi>Two</hi>
such. Besides, Scripture says, That when GOD
made two great Lights, he <hi>set them (both</hi> of them,
both of them <hi>then</hi> on the <hi>same day) in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Heaven, to give light upon the Earth.</hi>
And must not both of them then be in our
neighbourhood at that time? And lastly, It says,
That as GOD made the greater of these Lights
to rule the Day; so he made <hi>the lesser to rule the
Night.</hi> And when did the lesser begin to rule the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102637:48"/>
Night? Why, just when the greater began to rule
the Day. For as to the Dates of those their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Offices, we find no difference: Yet the
<hi>Theorist</hi> declares, That the presence of the Moon,
and consequently her rule then, was not so need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
because <hi>there were no long Winter-nights.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Moon was no more made to shine only in <hi>long</hi>
Winter-nights, than the Sun was to shine only in
<hi>long</hi> Summer-days. And which is more, as there
were no long Winter-nights then, so there were no
short Summer ones neither. So that set but the one
against the other, and the presence of the Moon may
seem to have been as needful then, in regard of the
length of Nights, as it is now.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter therefore there are no
good grounds for this piece of Scepticism. And to
what has been said concerning it, we need add but
this, Whereas it is argued, that there might be no
Moon, upon the account that there were no long
Winter-nights, nor great Pool of the Sea to move
or govern: we being assured that there was a Moon,
may much better invert the reason, and retorting
the force of the Argument, conclude that there must
be long Winter-nights, and the great Pool of the
Sea; because that Planet was present to rule the one,
and also to move or govern the other.</p>
               <p>Though Possibly the shutting her out of our
neighbourhood, might be warily done, and with
prospect of her malignant influence in the case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, namely, That she might not incommode or
hinder the rearing of the Earth, upon the Waters
of the Chaos. For truly had she been so near a
Neighbour at first, as she is now; she might have
been an injurious one as to that Affair. She might
have kept those Waters in such Motions, as would
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102637:49"/>
have dissipated their Oily Covering; and so have put
by the Primitive Earth, by marring the Basis where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it should have stood.</p>
               <p>Yet when all is said, I would have this Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lookt upon as propounded in way of <hi>Quaery,</hi>
Whether the unsettledness of the Chaotic Waters,
would not have hindred the Production of the first
Earth? rather than as a positively assertory Objection,
as if it must necessarily have done it.</p>
               <p>4. And here I cannot but remark the exceeding
<hi>precariousness</hi> of the <hi>Theorist</hi>'s Hypothesis, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the Chaos, and the Formation of the
Earth out of it. For that that Mass, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
<hi>of,</hi> and was then <hi>first</hi> dissolved <hi>into</hi> the <hi>simplest</hi>
elementary Bodies in the World; should cast forth
one Body (I mean Liquor) which in its purest na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
state, could contain so much Oiliness in it.
That this Oily matter should rise just when it did,
so as to be sit to receive the Earthly Particles in
their fall out of the Air; whereas had they come down
sooner, they had been drowned in the Water.
That this Oiliness should be of just such a quantity
as was sufficient for use; just enough, that is, to
mix with those Particles, and to make them into
a good Soil: whereas if it had been more, it would
have overflowed them, and made the Earth useless
as a greazy clod; if less, it would not have imbib'd
them, but they must have lien loose above, in a
fine and dry powder, that would have rendred the
Earth barren as an heap of Dust. That the Waters
also should be of a due Proportion; just sufficient,
that is, to make a temporary Deluge; and then to
retire into the Deep, and make a durable Sea:
whereas had there been much less, the Earth upon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102637:49"/>
its Disruption, could not have been drowned; and
had there been much more, it must have been quite
swallowed up for ever. That all these things should
be thus, is altogether precarious, and not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
but upon better evidence, than on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
is given in. For here any one will be of the
<hi>Theorist</hi>'s Judgment, as he has declared

then he who talks at this rate, ought,
when he writes of such momentous
things; to make them out very clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and evidently. Else (by what he says more in
the same paragraph) he proclaims himself guilty of
a rash attempt; even of tampering where he ought
not to meddle; and of striving to enter at that

to shut him out. For did they think good to let

               <p>5. But besides those, there is another behind,
which if lookt into, will not only be found as <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious</hi>
as any of the rest; but also <hi>Vnphilosophical.</hi>
And that is, <hi>The descent of the Terrestrial Particles
out of the Air,</hi> which constituted the Praediluvian
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102637:50"/>
Earth. For of those particles the <hi>Theory</hi> will have
<hi>that</hi> Earth to be made. Which were a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or
kind of excrementitious Sediment, that the Body of
the Air threw out, when it purified it self. But
that such a prodigious quantity of gross and fecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
substance, should then lodge in that part of the
Chaos; which was so light and volatile at the same
time, as to<note n="*" place="margin">Theor. <hi>pag.</hi> 54.</note> 
                  <hi>mount above</hi> other Bodies, and also
<hi>keep it self upon the wing, and play in open places;</hi>
might justly be questioned. For if such a vast deal
of drossy stuff, were mixed with the Aereal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
then whatever natural disposition (through
levity) it might have, to mount up; <hi>that,</hi> one would
think, should have so pinioned its Wings, as to have
kept it down, at least from rising very high; and
have been so heavy a clog upon it, as to have
spoiled its playing in open places; at least its play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up so far as the Moon. Yet that the <hi>Theory</hi>
allows it to have done so, is evident. For it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
them to<note n="†" place="margin">Theor. <hi>Pag.</hi> 60.</note> have <hi>showred down not only from
the middle Regions, but from the whole capacity or
extent of those vast spaces betwixt the Moon and us.</hi>
A supposition that is not only precarious, but also
seems (I say) to be somewhat <hi>Vnphilosophical.</hi> For
though upon the <hi>Theory</hi>'s account, it was necessary
these Particles should fill such vast spaces; that so
the Air might be able to contain <hi>enough</hi> of <hi>them,</hi>
and also have <hi>room</hi> enough wherein to move, and
by motion to purge it self, and cast them out:
yet how will the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> fall in with a smooth
Philosophic Explication? For in short, either the
Bounds of the Chaos, and the Sphaere of its gravity
(as I may call it) did extend as high as the Moon,
or they did not. If they did <hi>not,</hi> how came these
Particles there? Especially in such plenty, as to descend
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102637:50"/>
from thence in showers? Yea, how could they come
down at all? Let Philosophy make it out. In
case the Bounds of the Chaos and the Sphere of
its gravity, <hi>did</hi> reach so high as the Moon; then
why did not <hi>she</hi> come tumbling down with those
Particles? or rather sooner than they, as being much
heavier? Let Philosophy give an account of that.
For I think we have proved she was then in our
neighbourhood: though it seems there might be
more reason for that Doubt, than we were at first
aware of.</p>
               <p>6. And as this Assertion is not very consistent
with Philosophy, in it self; so in the Consequence
of it, it is <hi>against Scripture. That</hi> assures us, That
Light was the Product of the <hi>first day.</hi> And as it
was made then, so it was made <hi>visible</hi> in these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Regions. But this could not be, in case the
Earth were formed according to <hi>The Theory;</hi> the
Air would have been so full of terrestrial Dregs.
For it then contained enough of such Dregs, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
an Earthly Orb, of above one and twenty
Thousand Miles in Perimeter; and of a depth or
thickness we know not how great. And such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
measures of Earth in the Air, must needs
fill it with darkness; yea, with such a spissitude
and opacity, as would utterly have spoiled the
Pellucidness of it, for a considerable height above the
Chaos at least. For the coarsest and heaviest of
the floating Particles, setling continually towards the
Chaos; and the nearer they approached it, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still into a narrower compass (by reason the
spaces out of which they descended, were much
larger than those into which they gathered) the
mighty throng of them (they being crowded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102637:51"/>
as close as their gravity could squeez them in
their fall) would have made a Ring of such dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
about the Chaos, as would have been like to
that which once plagued <hi>Egypt.</hi> It would have been
palpable, that is, as containing a kind of tangible
thickness and clamminess in it.</p>
               <p>Yet in the <hi>first day,</hi> upon GOD's most powerful
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iat</hi> given, there was light, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 3. Which plainly
argues, That the Body of the Air, could not then
be of so foul a Constitution. If it had, though
GOD, when he pronounced, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> had
made the Sun (which he did not) and made him
much brighter than he is; he could not have
illightned these lower Regions, as being not only
clouded and covered, but even stuffed (as it were)
with an impenetrable density, or kind of material
darkness, so far as the aforesaid Ring of Circle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Chaos reached. But then how much less
could that Light have done it, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent
to the sun, and was no more than a faint
glimmering, in compare with his Glory. Yet on
the first day, I say, there was Light in the Chaotic
World, even on the very Waters of the Chaos.
For when GOD said, <hi>Let there be light;</hi> where
can that Light be thought to have shined more
especially, than where he said before there was
darkness? And where was darkness said to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but <hi>upon the face of the deep?</hi> Gen. 1. 2. And
therefore Light must be shot down thither, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Divine Command.</p>
               <p>But then here again this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> seems to be
unwarrantable, as grating too much upon Holy
Scripture. For whereas that certifies, That there
was Light on the first day, and upon the <hi>superficies</hi>
of the Abyss (as the Context intimates) this <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:102637:51"/>
puts nature into such a condition, as made
it impossible it should be so, and positively avers,
That it was quite contrary. For it tells us,<note n="*" place="margin">Theor. <hi>pag.</hi> 57.</note> 
                  <hi>The
Air was as yet thick, gross, and dark.</hi> And when
was it thus? Why, most certainly after the first
day was past. For it was after that the immense
Aereal Mass had had time to purifie it self in a great
measure; as appears by what follows: <hi>There being
abundance of little Particles swimming in it still, after
the grossest were sunk down.</hi> And if the Air were
thick and dark <hi>then,</hi> after the grossest Particles were
sunk down: what was it <hi>before,</hi> when they were but
sinking? And therefore as the first darkness, at the
World's Formation, is acknowledged to proceed,

               <p>1. THAT the Earth is not the solidest of the

to the Sun. And therefore we see <hi>Mars</hi> a less

                  <hi>the red Planet.</hi> But
though that degree of Proximity, which the Earth
holds to the Sun, shows her to be of a looser
substance, of a more porous, and less solid nature;
yet it cannot presently be improved into an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of her having a great quantity of Fire at
her Center. This the <hi>Theorist</hi> admits of as a thing
<note n="‖" place="margin">Page 64.</note> 
                  <hi>very reasonable;</hi> that there is a Fire at the Center
of the Earth, as there is a Yolk in the middle of an
Egg. But how can it be so reasonable according to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102637:52"/>
his Hypothesis? For, according to <hi>that,</hi> the Earth
was formed out of a Chaos, as we have heard.
And that Chaos was nothing but <hi>a fluid</hi> Mass con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of <hi>earthly</hi> Principles, as is intimated in these
words, <hi>By the Chaos I understand the matter of the
Earth and Heavens, without form or order; reduced
into a fluid Mass, wherein are the materials and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
of all Bodies.—Suppose then the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Air, Water, and Earth, which are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of all terrestrial Bodies, mingled without any order,</hi>
&amp;c. Now when the Chaos was a confused Mass,
in its principles so wholly <hi>terrestrial,</hi> and in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
so wholly <hi>fluid;</hi> it is so far from being <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reasonble,</hi> to allow a Fire at the Center of it,
(and if there were not a Fire at the Center of that,
how could there be one at the Center of the Earth?)
that it would rather be very absurd to do it.</p>
               <p>For so, in the First place, very contrary and
discordant natures, must have been tied to dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the closest cohabitation, or a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity.
In which state of conjunction or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
vicinity; how could they have subsisted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preying upon, and destroying one another?
Either the Fire would have dissipated the ambient
fluid Bodies that were near it; or else those fluid
humid Bodies, would have suffocated and extinguish'd
the Fire they inclosed. Or if they could have
dwelt together peaceably for a while, and not have
invaded one another. Yet.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When the Chaos began to separate, and
the grossest parts of it to sink down, those that
subsided first (it being a fluid Mass) must have
met at the very Center of it, and the rest as they
followed, would have gathered close about <hi>them;</hi>
and so constituting a central Globe of Earth, solid
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102637:53"/>
throughout, would have left no hollow space within
it, for a receptacle of Fire.</p>
               <p>Or Lastly, If there had been room left for Fire
at the Center of the chaos, yet how should Fire
have conveyed it self into that place of reception,
or by any means have come to dwell there?</p>
               <p>2. To make this out, it was necessary that the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>
of the Chaos, or the <hi>way</hi> of its entring into
the World, should have been declared by the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory.</hi>
But it is not done: which seems to be a king
of flaw in the <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> It takes no notice of the
cause of its Origin, nor of the manner of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction;
whereby this difficulty might have been
prevented or cleared up. And truly the way or
manner of its rise or emergency into being, is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be known for the explaining of <hi>other</hi> diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
as well as this. For upon it depends the
solution of several Phaenomena's, and very material
ones. I name but one, <hi>The Magnetism of the Earth,</hi>
as to the influence it has upon the <hi>Index nauticus,</hi>
or <hi>Needle of the Mariner's. Compass;</hi> the pointing
or Direction of which, is not so curious and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing;
but it is a useful in the affairs of human
Life. But then if the <hi>Theorist,</hi> (by setting his Chaos,
which came from we know not whence, in the
room of an Earth of a Planetary Origin, sunk down
from its lucid or Sidereous state) takes away the
supposed causes of this notable effect; it will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on him to assign others, from whence it
may be derived.</p>
               <p>In case it be objected, that the Phaenom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>non al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
is not satisfactorily accounted for in the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesian</hi>
way neither; forasmuch as it stumbles in the
formation of the <hi>Striate Particles,</hi> the main instrument
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102637:53"/>
of the work; and that <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> himself dares not
trust his own Hypothesis, but professes the Earth
to have been otherwise produced than <hi>that</hi> determines
(as shall be noted by and by) then I answer: As
this is really nothing to us, so it will not excuse the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orist</hi>
in the least, from clearing up the thing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to those measures he hath taken by himself.
It only shows, that the <hi>French</hi> Philosophy (of so
great fame) is too short to fathom the deeps
of Nature, and by no means quick-sighted enough
to see to the bottom of her profound Mysteries.
Though that Philosophy may grow up apace, to
so happy a perfection, as to be able to make a more
full discovery of such secrets; must needs be the
desire of wife and good Men.</p>
               <p>And so we return to the Enquiry we were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> How Fire should come to the Center of
the Earth. Which is a Problem the more intricate
and perplexed, in regard <hi>The Theory</hi> takes no
notice of the beginning of the Chaos. It tells in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that there was a Chaos, and what kind of one
it was; but it gives no manner of account how it
came into Being. As to <hi>that</hi> the Reader is left at
a loss, and has nothing to guide him but his own
Conjectures. I shall guess therefore as fairly at
the thing as I can; And to me it seems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that this Chaos should be produced one of
these Two ways; either by <hi>Creation,</hi> or by <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>
his way <hi>for generating Planets.</hi> Thought it will
not be over easie to make out, That it came into
existence by <hi>either</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>3. For first, to affirm that it dropt directly out
of the hand of Omnipotence, in way of <hi>Creation;</hi>
is more than we find warranted. Yea, we are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102637:54"/>
taught something, and that from Heaven, which is
very different from it; Namely, That<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 1. 1.</note>

GOD created the</hi> EARTH. And if it was

not be a <hi>Chaos;</hi> I mean <hi>Such</hi> a Chaos as the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory</hi>
makes it: for that was no <hi>Earth,</hi> nor had it
any specific or distinct <hi>Earth</hi> in it, as being<note n="†" place="margin">Theor. <hi>pag.</hi> 44.</note> 
                  <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

void. That is, of its designed order and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which were to beautifie it: and of all those
creatures which were to furnish it, and dwell in it.
And therefore, says the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem, it was
empty <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>
and void of every brute.</hi> And the Prophet describing
a most fearful destruction to come upon his People
by Wars; through which their fruitful Land was
to become a Wilderness, and Men and Birds were
to be driven away: tells us in the very Words of

                  <hi>desolation

Earth (in its original imperfection and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
was a <hi>Chaos:</hi> an incultivate and uninhabited

as having neither good from nor furniture in it.
But then at the same time it was <hi>an Earth</hi> too; and so
not such a Chaos as the <hi>Theory</hi> speaks it. I might

at <hi>this</hi> Earth, and intimates it was <hi>this</hi> very same Earth
at <hi>first,</hi> that it is <hi>now.</hi> The same as to substance
and nature, though not as to condition and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And <hi>this</hi> Earth, in the state of its primitive
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102637:54"/>
disorder and destitution, being the true <hi>Mosaic</hi> Chaos,
created in the beginning; we have no grounds to
belive, that any other besides it was ever brought forth
in way of <hi>creation.</hi> But we have good grounds to
believe that no other was so produced; inasmuch
as to assert it, would be to set up Phantasie against
<hi>Moses</hi>'s authority; and to bring presumptuous concei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
into competition with Scripture.</p>
               <p>But grant the Chaos to have been such as it is
supposed to be, and that it entred into the World
at the door of Creation: Yet here will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to make it reasonable, <hi>very reasonable</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Fire at its Center. For if there was a central
Fire in it, it must either be placed there <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally,</hi>
by the immediate power of the AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY;
and we have no reason to admit it
upon that score, because we are no where informed
of it. Or else it must be generated there in a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
way: and to admit <hi>that,</hi> would be against
reason too. For how could a vast quantity of
Flame, be bred in the Bowels of an Earthy Mass,
consisting of the Principles of all terrestrial Bodies.
And whoever shall peruse the first half of the <hi>Fifth</hi>
Chapter of the <hi>English Theory,</hi> will soon be

For there it appears that it
was resolved into nothing but Earth,
Air, Water, and an unctious substance;
and so could be made up of nothing
else. But Fire is quite another thing; and as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from those Elements, as motion is from rest;
or the most Celestial, from the most Terrestrial Matter;
and so in a course of Nature could not possibly issue from
them, and settle it self in the midst of them.</p>

4. We will pass therefore to the <hi>Second Conjecture;</hi>
whither indeed the Notion of central Fire in the
Earth, does most directly lead us: and that is
<hi>Des-Cartes</hi>'s Method, by which he supposeth Planets
to be formed. And according to <hi>that</hi> the Earth was
one of those <hi>fourteen,</hi> or <hi>fifteen</hi> Stars, which once
shined gloriously in their respective Heavens here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.
But being all overgrown and incrusted with
<hi>Maculaes,</hi> except one, and losing their native
strength and light; were swallowed up by the
<hi>Vortex</hi> of the surviving Luminary the Sun: and so
move round about him as so many <hi>Satellites</hi> or
Waiters of his, to this day. Though some of these
Planets also, that is, <hi>Secundary</hi> ones, are at the same
time carried about others of them. As the Moon,
about the Earth; the four <hi>Medicean</hi> ones, about
<hi>Iupiter;</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi>'s three <hi>Asseclae</hi> or Pages (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Cassinus.)</hi> about him.</p>
               <p>And here there may seem to be a plausible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
given, of the declared Central constitution of
the Earth, or of a Region of Fire at the heart of
it. For it having been all Flame heretofore; till it
was overspread with <hi>Maculaes</hi> (boiled out of it self,
and gendred first into a kind of foam or scum; and
afterwards into an harder substance) it could
not but retain much fiery matter in its Central
Parts. And thus this Fire would be sufficiently
protected too, against dissipation and danger of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction,
from the moist and lumpish Chaos which
surrounded it, and at the time of its separation would
have lain heavy upon it. For its Coat of <hi>Maculaes</hi>
worn next it, being nealed by furious heat, and
made into a strong arched Vault; there the inclosed
Element might have been secure (as in a mighty
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102637:55"/>
Granado-shell) never to be annoyed by any manner
of violence.</p>
               <p>But neither by <hi>this way,</hi> as quaint as it is, could
the Chaos step forth into being. For though it be
a spruce and gay invention; a contrivance rerely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious,
and prettily coherent; and withal so lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably
instrumental to the trim solution of sundry
difficulties, that some are ready to think 'tis pity
but it should be real: yet the very first dash of
<hi>Moses</hi>'s Pen, gives the Philosophic Bubble such a
shrewd prick, as flals it into Vanity and Romance.
<hi>In the beginning GOD created the Heaven and the
Earth.</hi> So that famous Man told an illiterate Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as a faithful Secretary of the MOST HIGH;
with intention fully to instruct them as to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
of the World, so far as comported with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestick
Office and brevity. And if GOD in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
at the very first, <hi>created</hi> the Earth, and
created it <hi>an Earth;</hi> how could it before that, be
a <hi>Chaos, such</hi> a Chaos, as it is represented to have
been? and how could it possibly rise into such a
Chaos, out of a Sun or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

place to act the part of a fixed Luminary, before
it became a Planet? But therefore to take off this,
and the like Arguments, the Story of the Creation
is supposed to relate to the <hi>Earthly World</hi> only.
How <hi>truly</hi> we shall a little consider in the Close of
this Chapter.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, to go on with what we have
in hand; the illustrious <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> is on our side.
He openly professes (as was noted<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 2. § 4.</note> above) that
he did not think the Earth was made of a Star,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102637:56"/>
according to his Principles; but was brought forth
by Creation. And he judged thus, for the same
reason, I am now urging. Because,<note n="†" place="margin">Princip. part. 3. Art. 45.</note>

Christians nos docet; the Christian Faith teacheth us
as much.</hi> So that he who shall teach otherwise,
must (in the opinion of that renowned Philosopher)
broach a Doctrine against Divine Revelation. And
therefore what has been said that way, I hope will
relish the better, as falling in with the sentiments
of so exceeding worthy and judicious a Person. And
herein he acted like a true and noble Christian
Philosopher indeed; in that he made his <hi>Hypothesis</hi>
stoop to the Religion of Heaven, and would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
his Principles, rather than they should run
counter to the sacred Oracles. Yea, the great Man goes
farther, and adds, <hi>hocque etiam ratio naturalis plane
persuadet; and this also</hi> (that the World was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
with all its perfection, so that there was in it
a Sun, and an Earth, <hi>&amp;c.) natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

thing not only worthy of GOD, to make Creatures
perfect at first, but <hi>natural reason perswades</hi> that he
actually did so: we must either conclude that the
Earth was made so (as <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> does) or else

So that if the Opinion, the professeed and openly
avowed Opinion, of the most eminent Christian Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher;
yea, of the admired Author of the new
Philosophy (the fittest person amongst Philosophers
to judge in the Case) will cast the Scales for us;
we have it on our side, that the Earth was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in his way; or according to his <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. But then the premisses considered, to admit there
is a Fire at the Center of the Earth; is so far from being
<hi>very reasonable,</hi> as the <hi>Theory</hi> holds; that according to
the fairest measures or accounts of things, which Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
has given to the World as yet; it rather appears
to be very <hi>unreasonable.</hi> For however <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>'s
Principles lean that way, and countenance the Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon;
yet he himself, we see, not only doubts of his
own <hi>Hypothesis</hi> as to the Earth's formation; but has
publickly declared that they who sail by his Compass,
must swim against the stream of <hi>Natural Reason.</hi>
               </p>

an Oval Figure. Nor could it have been without

being necessary in the works of Nature very often to

when, according to those Principles, it could not
be produced at all? For put by the Formation of these

could be no Planets, and so no Earth: the matter of
the third Element being not to be made without those
particles.</p>

not possibly be made out of a Sun, or Star, as the new
philosophy would have it. For then (say those
Doctors) a more proper word should have express'd
its production, viz, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which imports the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a thing out of praeexistent matter. Some
slight ground for this seems to be laid in Scripture;
and that in <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Cosmopoeia</hi> too. For it is said,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. That <hi>GOD rested from all his work,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>which he Created to make.</hi> Where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we allow a distinct signification, to the two words
implying that he made some things out of <hi>nothing,</hi> and
others out of <hi>prepared matter:</hi> we must charge the HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY
GHOST with indecent Tautology. Though if we
consider again that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is used promiscuously
to express GOD's making of things <hi>ex praejacente mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
out of extant matter,</hi> as well as out of <hi>nothing,</hi> and
that in the very story of the Creation: we may well sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that there was too much niceness in <hi>the Masters,</hi>
rather than such respective significations; to be strictly
and continually appropriated to the words. Only as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as did thus criticize, have thereby fairly given their
suffrage, for that truth which we contend for. That
when GOD created the Earth (according to <hi>Moses</hi>'s nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative)
he educ'd it directly out of <hi>nothing.</hi> And so
it cannot have a fire at the Center of it, because it
issu'd forth into being; in <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>'s way.</p>
               <p>8. Being unawares fallen upon that expression
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>which he created to make:</hi> in reverence
to the <hi>Seventy;</hi> I cannot but take one short step out of
the way, to vindicate their translation of it. They
render it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>which he began to make.</hi> As
if the work of Creation had not then been consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.
But that could not be their meaning. For
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102637:58"/>
whereas we read in the beginning of the Chapter;
<hi>the Heavens and the Earth, and all the Host of them
were finished:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they rendred by, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
<hi>and they were compleated.</hi> They could only mean
therefore, that <hi>GOD rested from all his work,</hi> which
at any time, in the six precedent days, <hi>He had BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVN
to make.</hi> And so their sense is sound and
true, though they keep not close to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>teral
strictness of the Original. And that they thought
the Creation was wholly perfected before the seventh
day; is apparent from that liberty they took, in
translating the beginning of the second verse of the
same Chapter; which perhaps is more culpable.
For whereas the <hi>Hebrew</hi> says, GOD had ended his
work, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>on the seventh day:</hi> departing,
quite from the proper signification of the word, they
render it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>on the sixth day.</hi> As if they
feared they should offend (by stretching the work
of Creation too far) in case they had turned it, <hi>GOD
had ended his work on the seventh day.</hi> Here was
more than <hi>abundans cautela,</hi> too much caution used.
Especially if <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>'s Maxime be authentic,

noted this the rather, as containing in it a full consent,

Universe, were then first made <hi>conspicuous,</hi> or began to

<hi>Moses</hi> is so to be understood, as he has limited him.</p>
               <p>But then I must continue the enquiry, What does,
<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, LET THERE BE, signify in <hi>other</hi> places of
the same Chapter where it occurrs so often? why,
it infallibly implys the <hi>production.</hi> of those things, to
which it does respectively relate. It imports God's
commanding or willing their existence; and their
immediate emergency into being, in obedience to his
powerful Will or Mandate. This is obvious even to
slightest notice. Thus, when GOD said, <hi>Let there be
light:</hi> it follows immediately, <hi>and there was Light.</hi>
When GOD said, <hi>Let there be a firmament:</hi> it follows, <hi>and
GOD made a Firmament.</hi> When GOD said, <hi>Let the
waters be gathered together into one place</hi> (that so there
might be dry land, and Seas:) it follows, <hi>It was so.</hi>
When GOD said, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth Grass, &amp;c.</hi> it
follows, <hi>and the Earth brought forth Grass, &amp;c.</hi> When
GOD said, <hi>Let the Waters bring forth abundantly:</hi> it
follows, <hi>the Waters brought forth abundantly.</hi> When
God said, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth the living creature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his king, and Cattel, &amp;c.</hi> it follows, <hi>And GOD made
the Beast of the Earth after his kind, and Cattel, &amp;c.</hi> And
when the Divine and Omnipotent <hi>Fiat</hi> did all-along
carry such energy with it, as thus to produce other
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102637:59"/>
things; as in the series of the Story: can it in reason be
thought to do less, when GOD pronounced, LET
THERE BE LIGHTS? To make this one <hi>Fiat,</hi> differ
in sense from the rest; would be to depart from the
Rules of a just Exposition. Yet unless we force such a
difference into it, it must signify more than the bare <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi>
of lights upon the clearing up of the Chaos
and the Sky: that is, it must signify those lights were
just then <hi>created.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is farther evident thus; in that GOD
takes notice, express notice of the <hi>use</hi> of these Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries,
and therein particularly provides for the
<hi>conspicuity</hi> and <hi>Radiancy</hi> of them.<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 1. 15.</note>

               <p>In case it be objected, that the <hi>Stars</hi> give little

he mentions, they were very serviceable and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensibly

it was but one single thing; and so answers
not the import of the Word, HOST, it being of a

                  <hi>the HOST of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
That phrase in Holy Writ, does <hi>usually</hi> (I think)
<hi>continually</hi> referr, either to the <hi>Angels,</hi> or else to the
<hi>Lights</hi> of Heaven. And of the <hi>latter</hi> of those at least,
it must here be understood. But then none of these
Luminaries being formed out of the Chaos; and all
of them but one, placed in remote or superiour
Heavens: hence it is evident, that the Story of the
Creation, is not to be restrained to the Terrestrial
World. For that <hi>Moses</hi> did not only speak of them,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102637:60"/>
but of their being <hi>created</hi> then; is manifest from the
words before us. <hi>The HEAVENS and the EARTH</hi>
were <hi>FINISHED,</hi> and all the <hi>HOST of THEM.</hi>
where, if by the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>its Host,</hi> being <hi>FI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISHED;</hi>
We are to understand their being CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TED
at that time, as we certainly must: then
are we bound to understand, that the Heavens
and <hi>their Host,</hi> were so too; because the same
thing is equally predicated of <hi>both.</hi> It may be
worth the while also to remark that Passage in
the 148. <hi>Psalm.</hi> Where the inspired Man desiring
that GOD might be glorified by means of the
Celestial Luminaries; crys out, <hi>Praise ye him, sun

that when GOD commanded, <hi>Let there be lights;</hi>
this was not a command whereby they <hi>appeared</hi> only,
but whereby they were <hi>created:</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> with
the rest was <hi>then</hi> commanded into being.</p>

not the work of Creation, which <hi>Moses</hi> writes of,
comprehend more than those parts of Nature, which
were made of the Earthly Chaos.</p>
               <p>It may be not, will <hi>Platonists</hi> say; at least this

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102637:61"/>
but send them down from a state of <hi>Preexistence.</hi>
But then (not to ingage in a new Controversie)
I reply in short; If the humane Souls came into
their Bodies out of a state of <hi>Preexistence;</hi> then when
they descended, they were either pure from sin; or
they were not. If they were not pure, then how
did GOD create <hi>Man in his own Image?</hi> Gen. 1. 27.

his own most dear and spotless creatures; as to
thrust them down, or suffer them to fall, out of a
state of Aethereal light and happiness, into a state
of darkness and stupid <hi>silence,</hi> out of which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Platonism</hi>) they must come, to be
incarnate, and so slide into a condition more forlorn
still? Truly if the goodness and wisdom of Heaven,
so decreed and ordered things, as that the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plast's
(and so their Childern's) innocent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
Spirits must be betrayed or precipitated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that state of <hi>inactivity</hi> (which might last for
millions of years of ages) and then out of that
squalid condition, sink into a worse; into one full
of inexpressible imperfections, miseries, and dangers,
where innumerable multitudes lie under almost an
inevitable necessity of falling into the torments of
everlasting destruction: if this, I say, be the result
of Havens wise Councils and Decrees, <hi>Preex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi>
will give no satisfaction to understanding Men;
and do as little honour to the Glorious GOD. It
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102637:61"/>
will rather be a Scandal, than a Key to Providence.</p>
               <p>Now that the Souls of the first Pair of Mankind
did preexist, it being improbable; and that they
should be <hi>ex traduce,</hi> it being impossible: what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
but that GOD <hi>created</hi> the Souls, when he
made the Bodies of those Persons? And so the work
of Creation, of which <hi>Moses</hi> treats, is so far
from being limitable to the <hi>lower</hi> World, or indeed

be rejected. And for this reason the supposed Form
of the Earth cannot be maintained. For according
to that, the Element of Water was fast shut up
within the Exteriour Orb of the Earth; and how
could it issue forth from thence, through so thick
and solid a terrestrial Concretion? For that being
made after the manner abovesaid, there could be no
gaping chasms, nor indeed little clefts or chinks in
it; whereat the imprison'd Waters might get out.
Or if there had been never such plenty of lesser
cracks or larger rists in it; yet the Water being
settled in that place, which was proper to its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
there it would have staid by the innate Law
or Principle of its Gravity. Unless by Elastie
Power, Protrusion, Rarefaction, or the like, it were
forced thence; there it would have made its perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:102637:62"/>2. But therefore <hi>Exhalation</hi> is here made use of,
and as a proper Engin is set to do this mighty
work, of fetching up Rivers from the inaccessible
Pit. The operation, in short, was performed thus,
The heat of the Sun raising plenty of Vapours,
chiefly about the middle parts of the Earth, out
of the subterraneous Deep; they finding most li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and easiest progress, toward North and South,
directed their motion towards the Poles of the Earth.
Where, being condensed by the cold of those Regions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Rain, they descended in constant and exuberant distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
And these Distillations were the Fountains that
supplied the first World with Rivers, running continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from the Polar to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> parts of the Earth.
But according to this Hydrography, I shall endeavour,
first, to make it out that there could be no Rivers
in due time: and secondly, that there could be none
at all. And as for Springs, the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> does not
pretend to any.</p>
               <p>First, It would have kept Rivers too long, out
of being. For according to that Philosophy we have
now to do with, the new made Earth was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of nothing but Dust and an Oily liquor. And it
being of such a Composition, and of a vast thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
it must needs be a considerable time before
the Sun could penetrate into the Abyis under it,
and draw up vapours from thence; if it could do
it at all in so copious a manner.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Air being at first quite empty of
Vapours, it would take a great quantity of them
to make the Atmosphere of the Earth, or to fill
up that. To which add that every part of the
Earth about its Aequator, being turned from the
Sun, every four and twenty hours, as long as it was
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102637:63"/>
obverted to it; many of those Vapours which were
lifted up by day, would fall down again by night
in the same Latitude where they arose, without
being dispersed to the Polar Regions. And thus the
production of Rivers would have been something
retarded again.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The surface of the Earth being endued
with a wonderful feracity it must immediately put
forth in an inconceiveable plenty of all sorts of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables:
which from luxuriant pullulations, would
strangely advance by most speedy and prodigious
growths. And this Superfetation of the virginal Soil,
proceeding from that extraordinary fruitfulness where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it was originally impregnated; must farther
hinder the early rise of Rivers. Not so much by
consuming the matter of them, as another way.
For the Earth being thick beset with the flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>apparatus,</hi> or goodly Furniture of its own bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth (such perhaps for abundance and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
as never crowned the most fertil Country,
or fruitful season since) though Dews or Rains fell
without intermission; yet the Waters would have
stuck or hung so much, amongst the rank and
matted tufts of Grass, Herbs, Shrubs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as not
to have been able in a short space of time, to
have gotten into Streams, and constituted Rivers
of such a length, as they must have been of.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In case these Waters had met with no
checks, but had fallen immediately into such Bodies,
as would have forced their passage along in holding
Currents: yet then they must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ave digged their
own Chanels too, being sure to find none till they
made them. But considering how slowly they must
have crept, as having no kind of Precipices or
steeper downfals to quicken them; and how glib
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102637:63"/>
they must have been, by gliding gently upon the
fat and viscous Glebe; and what a thick and thrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and close wrought Mantle the Earth then wore:
for them to have furrowed out deep and winding
passages in that Earth, must have been a good
whiles work again, if fecible at all without the help
of Art. For</p>
               <p>Lastly, It seems improbable that any Rivers,
without the help of <hi>that,</hi> should have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
The reason is this, The Rains descending
at all times, and in all places alike, a round the
Poles; and the whole surface of the Earth being
more level and even, than any Plain in the World;
the Waters instead of parting into streams, would
have spread over all the Earth at once, in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
diffusion; as any one may find by pouring
Water upon a Globe. By which overflow, the
Primigenial Soil (which was a light and soft Mold)
being suppled into a perfect Moor or Quagmire;
must have continued drowned, till by reducing the
Water into artificial Canels, it could have been laid
dry. But when there would have been hands for
this great work (GOD making Mankind but in
one single Pair) let them that please consider. And
they may think also, where Paradise could have
been; and what shift poor Fowls, and Beasts, yea,
Men themselves should have made; till the Earth,
like a Fen, thus under Water, could have been cut
and drained.</p>
               <p>3. Now so slow and late a Production of Rivers,
would have drawn two great inconveniences after it.
It would have clashed with Scripture; and charged
Providence with Preposterousness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:102637:64"/>
First, It would have clashed with Scripture. For
no sooner was Man created and placed in Paradise,
but presently we read, That a <hi>River went out of</hi> Eden
<hi>to water the garden, Gen.</hi> 2. 10. But had all Rivers
come into being, as the <hi>Theory</hi> teaches, one could
never have been there so early. Nor did it go out
of <hi>Eden,</hi> by running through it only, but it arose
there, say some, and as much is signified, they would
perswade us, by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which denotes its
<hi>going out</hi> (they tell us) as a Child goes out of the
Womb: and so the River must be born in <hi>Eden,</hi> or
spring up originally there. But the Word is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
used, in a larger sense, both in the Sacred and
Rabbinical Writings, to have any such stress laid
upon it. Though most certain it is, that a River
there was in <hi>Eden;</hi> and in order of Divine Story
(and so why not in order of time?) very early:
even before the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> or the Formation of
<hi>Eve.</hi> And which is farther remarkable, it was a
large River too; for it was parted into several
Heads, and able to feed most considerable streams.
One of which, namely, <hi>Euphrates,</hi> is reckoned among
the biggest Rivers in the World, to this day. But
had it come by derivation from the Polar Fountains, it
could never have been made so soon; much less could
it have been so large. And then besides, we read
at the Sixth Verse of the same Chapter, that <hi>GOD
had not caused to rain upon the Earth</hi> as yet; and
so that River could not possibly proceed from Rains,
that fell about the ends or Poles of it.</p>
               <p>Though (by the way) how that Expression should
countenance an <hi>Impluvious state</hi> before the Flood, as
<note n="*" place="margin">Page 206.</note> the <hi>Latin Theory</hi> would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ake it, is not so clear and
easie to be understood. For, if we consider, there was
no Water upon that Earth, but what fell in Rain.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102637:64"/>
And in two Regions of that Earth, there were Rains
continually descending: and they seem to have been
of little other use, than for those Rains to come down
in. And to say, That by the Earth <hi>there,</hi> was meant
only <hi>Regiones cult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> or the <hi>inhabited Countries</hi> of the
Earth; would be an unwarranted restriction of the
Scriptures sense. For in the Story of the Creation,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Earth,</hi> is still put (as we may observe)
for the <hi>entire Globe</hi> of the Earth, or at least for
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the whole face of the ground,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 6.
Nor may it be said to be spoken <hi>ad captum vulgi,</hi> as <hi>to
the common peoples apprehension.</hi> For surely they were
not such dull Souls, in the first World, but (had Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
stood in that order as the <hi>Theory</hi> sets it) they
would have traced their Rivers to their heads, many
hundreds of Years before the Deluge; and have been
generally and throughly acquainted, with those Rains
by which they were raised. They would then have
known as well, that Rivers came from Rains at the
ends of the Earth; as we do now, that Gold comes
from <hi>Guinea,</hi> or the distant <hi>Indies.</hi> Yea, the want of
room (they multiplying exceedingly) would have
forced them to find out the rainy Regions, while they
must have spread their Colonies to the Borders of
them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It would tax the Providence of Heaven
with Praeposterousness. That is, in reference to one
sort of Animals, the Fishes. For then they must have
been brought into being, before there were fit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles
for them. I confess, <hi>GOD said, Let the
waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that
hath life, Gen.</hi> 1. 20. Which may seem to take off the
objected inconvenience. For if so be that the Waters
were to bring forth Fishes, before they existed, they
could not lack agreeable Mansions upon their first
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102637:65"/>
emergency into being: inasmuch as the same Element
was to afford them habitation, from whence they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
their production.</p>
               <p>But grant that the Waters were to be productive of
Fishes. Yet they might not be so <hi>prima vice,</hi> at the
very first. Or if they did then help towards producing
them; it could be only by yielding a rude kind of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
out of which they might be formed: such as
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Rib was for the making of <hi>Eve.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though <hi>GOD said,</hi> at the Twentieth Verse, <hi>Let
the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that
hath life;</hi> Yet in the next Verse it is said, That <hi>GOD
CREATED every living creature that moveth, which
the waters brought forth abundantly.</hi> Where, if, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>created,</hi> does not denote GOD's making them out of
pure nothing, (according to the rigid School-notion of
<hi>Creation)</hi> yet it signifies (which is the <hi>lowest</hi> sense of
the word) that he made them <hi>ex materia prorsus inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili,</hi>
out of matter of it self (till the Creator chang'd
and disposed it) altogether unfit for such an use. So
that albeit the Waters brought forth Fishes, yet they
did not do it, by any <hi>vis plastica, formative power</hi> of
their own solely; but so far as they afforded general
(and naturally inept) Materials for their composition.</p>
               <p>And, in some sense, the Waters (we know) have
brought forth Fishes ever since. That is, by cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>Spermata,</hi> or <hi>Spawn</hi> committed to them. For
they receiving those young and tender rudiments of
life (upon their first ejection or exclusion) into their
liquid Wombs; do nurse up the naked and imperfect
Seminals, through the several Stages of an incompleat
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Birth;</hi> till they arrive at animation and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.
But then this implys that the First Fishes
came into being by an extraordinary way; and could
not be produced as they are now; because there were
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102637:65"/>
none before them, none to propagate them, by casting
forth such spermatic Principles. The aboriginal ones
(as I may call them) for this very reason, must be
made by GOD's immediate hand. Though whether
he made them out of nothing, or out of watry Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials;
is all one as to our purpose. For either way it
was absolutely necessary, that Rivers should be extant
as well as they; that so they might be in a readiness to
receive them.</p>
               <p>But now according to the Hypothesis under consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
the Fishes of the two, must exist first, if
the Creation (as I hope we have proved) were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in Six Days. For they were made upon the
<hi>Fifth Day,</hi> says <hi>Moses,</hi> and how could there be Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
so timely according to this new contrivance? The
Sun it self was created but just the day before. And so
what a work must here be done, to make Rivers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etaneous
with the Fish we speak of? The beams of the
Sun must have pierced into the Earth, and that so deep
as to have reached the Abyss. And from thence
plenty of Vapours must have been exhal'd into the Air.
And these Vapours being upon the wing must have
taken their flight as far as the Polar Regions. And
there they must have been condensed into Rains. And
these Rains must have made Bodies of Waters. And
these Bodies of Waters must have been so great, as to
have slowed along, through or against all obstacles.
And these Floods must have been so violent, as to have
hollow'd out Chan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ls for themselves all the way they
went. And all this in one days space. Otherwise
there must have been no Fishes made. Or they
must not have been made, when GOD says they were.
Or when they were made, there must have been no
sutable Receptacles for them. For as for the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Abyss, they could by no means serve
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102637:66"/>
for this use, as will appear in the Sequel of our
Discourse.</p>
               <p>4. But we are to pursue this matter farther yet.
There could be no Rivers <hi>in due time; that</hi> has been
evidenced. It is next to be proved that there could
be <hi>none at all before the Flood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How Rivers were first made, we have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
by Rains descending from above. But
whereabouts were these to fall? <hi>In the Frigid Zones,
or towards the Poles,</hi> we are told; and<note n="*" place="margin">Theor. <hi>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> 227.</note> the Scheme
representing them, shows as much. But then, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
they should have been in great danger, yea,
under inavoidable necessity of Freezing. For the
Sun (according to this Hypothesis) moving always
in the Aequinoctial, before the Flood; he would
constantly have been as remote from those raining
Regions, as he is now from us in the depth of Winter,
when he runs through <hi>Capricorn;</hi> or which is all one,
when the Earth traverseth the opposite <hi>Sign.</hi> And
there being <hi>then,</hi> no such Clouds as <hi>now;</hi> nor yet
any Seas, by their foggy Vapours to mitigate the
keenness of the Air; nor any Hills or Valleys, to cause
a warmth by confused and irregular reflections of
the Sun-beams: the Frosts within the Polar Circles,
must needs have been exceeding sharp and terrible.
And so the Fountains that should have fed the whole
World with Water, would have been fast seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up.</p>
               <p>And then if the Earth were of an Oval Figure
(as this Hypothesis affirms) grant but its Diameter
to have been the same at its Aequinoctial parts <hi>then,</hi>
that it is <hi>now</hi> (as in reason it must be greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is fallen in since, and so grown less) and
this would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et its Poles a great deal farther
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102637:66"/>
from the <hi>Aequator,</hi> and so from the Sun. For to
inlarge a Circle, into an Oval Figure, its <hi>area</hi>
must be made a quarter as big again at least one
way of its Diameter, as it was before.
<figure>
                     <head>Fig: 2 Pag: 115</head>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, if the Circle <hi>c d e f</hi> be divided into Eight
parts, by the parallel lines 1 2 3 4 5 6 7: we
shall find that the two Arches <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b,</hi> forming
the Circle into a <hi>moderate</hi> Oval; will at the
points <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b,</hi> include such spaces between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102637:67"/>
and the sides of the Circle <hi>c,</hi> and <hi>e,</hi> as shall be
equal in breadth, to any two spaces betwixt the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distant
Parallels. According to which proportions
allowing the Earth to be 7000. Miles in Diameter
(though the true measure of it makes it more) and
then adding a fourth part to it, to render it Oval,
<hi>viz.</hi> 1750. Mile thickness: the Earth at each Pole,
must bear above fourteen Degrees Latitude, or near
nine hundred Miles extent, more than if it had been
exactly round. And that <hi>Hypothesis</hi> which removes
its Poles so much farther from the Sun; must also
allow the cold thereabouts to be proportionably
augmented. And though in the hundred and fourth
Degree of Latitude (as we must call it) on each side
of the Aequator; that is, at the very Poles, there
might have been perpetual day; the beams of the
Sun reaching <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b,</hi> the two Poles of the supposed
Oval Earth; and illightning them continually: yet
his heat in those places, must needs have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
languid; forasmuch as his Orb would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
have been half above, and half under the <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon</hi>
to them. This will be clear from the Scheme, if
we do but conceive the line <hi>i d f</hi> to be the Aequator,
and the Sun ever moving directly in it. For then it must
divide him into two Semidiameters <hi>g</hi> and <hi>h,</hi> at all times
conspicuous at the Poles respectively. That is to say,
the Semidiameter <hi>g,</hi> at the Pole <hi>a;</hi> and the Semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>h,</hi> at the Pole <hi>b.</hi> But then the Sun's being thus hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
must of necessity be a mighty diminution of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
especially at so extraordinary a distance. It
would have rendred his warmth more faint, than it is
with us in the Winter Solsti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, when he is just a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or half set.</p>
               <p>But our business is rather to enquire what the
temperature of the Air would have been, nearer
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102637:67"/>
to the polar Circles; where these Rains are conceived
to have fallen. Now if these Regions were as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the Sun, as we are when he is farthest
from us; the Air must have been every whit as
freezing there, as it is with us in the very dead of
Winter. And that they were some degrees farther
from the Sun, I think we need not question. For
when the Sun is gone farthest from us, he reaches
but to twenty three degrees and an half of Southern
Latitude: which added to our fifty two of Northern,
the whole amounts but to seventy five and an half.
But granting the Earth to have been stretcht out to
that length, to which its oval fashion would have
extended it; and the supposed dripping Countries in
the first World, might easily have been farther from
the Sun (and consequently colder) by several Degrees.</p>
               <p>In case it be opposed, That nights with us, when
the Sun is retired to his utmost point in <hi>Capricorn,</hi>
are some hours longer, than they could be in the
prediluvial State; and that this might so far strengthen
the Cold, as to make it superior to what it could
be in the wet Regions we speak of: I answer, though
our Nights be somewhat longer; yet we now dwell
among Clouds and Seas, which do very much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
and thicken the Air; and so make it warmer
than it could be in the primitive World, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them were to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound at the rate we have
them. And truly the perpetual absence of them,
must needs have made the Air more severely nipping
in the Frigid Zones <hi>then,</hi> than it is <hi>now.</hi> Especially
they being shot out so far from the Sun, by virtue
of the oblong figure of the first Earth. For even
as the Earth is now of a Globular make; the Rains
might have fallen in the Frigid Zones for ten Degrees
latitude, or six hundred Miles together, and yet
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102637:68"/>
(on the one side have been five Degrees distant from
the Poles themselves; and on the other side) have
been seventy five Degrees distant from the Sun in the
Aequinox; which is as far (to half a Degree) as he
is ever remov'd from us. But then if we add better
than fourteen Degrees more to each Pole, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of the Earth's O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iformity; the Rains must
be removed a great way farther from the Sun still (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the whole fourteen Degrees) into Climates most
horridly cold and freezing. And though there would
have been constant Day about the very Poles; yet in
this Oval Earth, there would have been as much
Night in the presumed rainy Regions; as in any other
part of it whatever. For so we may observe, that
those rays of the Sun, which fell upon that Earth, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
at <hi>k</hi> and <hi>l</hi> (whereabouts according to the Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphic
<note n="*" place="margin">Page. 227.</note> Scheme in the <hi>Theory,</hi> we may imagine the
Rainy Regions were) could not illighten the opposite
side of it at <hi>m</hi> and <hi>n,</hi> till such time as those points were
turned to him, which they could not be sooner than
the point <hi>f;</hi> where it must have been of the biggest
circumference, measuring it in way of Longitude.</p>
               <p>Indeed it must be owned that it is not the Sun's
distance in Winter, which does only or chiefly make
our Climate so cold; but the oblique falling of
his beams on the Earth. So that instead of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
Southward forty seven Degrees (the whole
space between the Tropics) were he at the time of his
entring into <hi>Cancer</hi> (when he is nearest to us) but
elevated directly as many Degrees, or removed only
perpendicularly from us: our Winter (if any) would
be very moderate, because his beams would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
in the same Angles as before. But his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
from us being in way of latitude or declination;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is Rays must fall the more obliquely upon the Earth.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102637:68"/>
From which kind of incidence it comes to pass, that
they rebound in obtuse Angles, and the heat which
should be caused by more direct reverberations, is
impaired. As also many of his beams are reflected
by the <hi>Atmosphaere,</hi> another way, and come not at us at
all. But then the Sun being farther distant from
the rainy Regions in the praediluvian Earth; his
beams must have fallen more obliquely upon them
still; and so the cold must have been greater there,
because his influence was less. And therefore what
can be thought, but that the Dewy Rains (if any
could have been in those parts) should either in falling
have been turned into Hails; or if they fell in Water,
have been frozen into Ice. And so instead of stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
along and refreshing the Earth, they must have
stood congeled into Mountains. Especially if we
consider that extremely cold hanging Mists must
have always incircled those Regions above; and so
have shut out that sorry kind of influence, which
might have been derived from the so remote and
feeble Sun.</p>
               <p>It may a little inforce what has been said, that all
who have held (with the <hi>Theorist</hi>) the Torrid Zone
was uninhabitable by reason of heat; ever believed
that the Frigid ones were so, through extremity of
cold: as <hi>Aristotle, Cicero, Strabo, Mela, Pliny,</hi> and
others.</p>
               <p>To which add, That several Navigators, attempting
to find out a nearer course to <hi>China,</hi> have been frozen
to death. Yet they failed nothing so far Northward,
as the rainy Regions in the Oval Earth, must have
lain. Though without question they chose the
most seasonable time for the Enterprize; I mean
when the Sun was on this side of the Aequator:
where now he may advance (though he could not do
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102637:69"/>
so (says the <hi>Theory</hi>) before the Flood) twenty three
Degrees and an half; which on Earth we reckon
about fourteen hundred Miles.</p>

And again; <hi>their Tents are covered with Whales skins, the

and a just revenge which he took upon the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
They had grievously offended and provoked
His MAJESTY, by very great and epidemical Sins.
For as we read in the Sixth of <hi>Genesis, the wickedness
of Man was great, and every imagination of the thoughts
of his heart was only evil continually; and all flesh had
corrupted his way</hi> before him. Whereupon the HOLY
GHOST speaking of God <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, after the
manner of Men; declares that he was grieved at
the heart to see this. And such was the grief he
conceived, that He repented He made Man. And
so vehemently did He repent of making him, that
He resolved to destroy him again. And not only
<hi>him,</hi> but most of his fellow creatures with him, made
in good measure for his use and benefit. And not
only <hi>them</hi> but the Earth it self in some sense, which
had been the scene of his vanity and unrighteousness.
And at length He decrees and proclaims aloud, that
the Instrument of this fearful general destruction,
should be a Deluge of water, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 17. So that
nothing can be more clear, than that the Flood was a
punishment of Man's sins, and was design'd and sent
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102637:70"/>
on purpose to be so. The Consequence from which
is, that if Man had not transgressed; the Earth had
never been so lamentably drowned.</p>
               <p>But here then the truth of the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> we are
upon will come into Question: in that it would have
let in the Flood upon the World, though it had not
been ungodly; though Men had been never so inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
or upright. For if the Earth had been formed,
as is above supposed; it must have been of the same
structure that is there phansied. It must have held
the same situation to the Sun, and the same motio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
about it. And the Sun must have had the same
power over the Earth, and the same effects upon it.
It must have pierced it as deep, and parched it as
much, and ripened it as fast for disruption as ever.
The time of which being once come, down it must
have plunged into the <hi>Abyss</hi> below; and all living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, must have sunk and drowned together with
it self. No Natural Causes could have had the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to moral integrity: but on they would have
driven in their appointed Courses, till they had come to
the Tragical event we speak of. So that had all the Sons
and Daughters of Men, been as pure and bright, as they
could possibly have dropt out of the Mint of Creation;
they must still have perisht without pity or remedy.</p>
               <p>And so what would have become of the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with <hi>Adam,</hi> in case he had stood? For by
such a Fatality as this in Nature (not unlike to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Decree in Divinity) his Posterity must have
died, though he had not sinned, nor they neither.
Which would have been a strange and unparallel'd
severity, and such as did never issue form GOD.
<hi>Tophet</hi> indeed is prepared of old; and there are end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and intolerable torments beyond this life. But
none need suffer them unless they please. For still
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102637:70"/>
we must be authors of our own misery if any be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ides
us. And if our happiness chance to be blown up at
last, the Train that does it, must be laid and fired
by our selves. But by this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> the Race of
Mankind must have been wofully undone, though
they never deserv'd it. For the primitive Earth had
that in it, which we have; Frailty in its very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Constitution: And in the ordinary setled
Course of things, must necessarily have been dissolv'd
and delug'd.</p>
               <p>2. And if purest Innocence must have fared thus
ill; <hi>Repentance</hi> for certain should have sped no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<hi>That</hi> I add for this reason. <hi>Noah,</hi> we know, was
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Preacher of righteousness. And that
not only in a vocal way; but by his religious and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
life. Yea, more than so, his building the Ark
was a Mechanical Sermon to the World; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
of an hundred and twenty years long. <hi>For</hi> in
the same<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> Chapter where GOD denounc'd the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

days of Man</hi> (that is, before the Flood was to come)
<hi>shall be an hundred and twenty years.</hi> And such a
way of Preaching, and of such a continuance; in
reason should have wrought with that stubborn Age,
beyond the most elaborate and pathetic Discourses.
And GOD seems to have expected no less. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it did not, His Holy SPIRIT has clapt a black
Brand upon them, and markt them out for incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible
and ungracious Wretches. <hi>Who were diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
in the Days of Noah, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>while the Ark was a preparing.</hi>
                  </hi> Disobedience in
that juncture, under such a warning against it, and
motive to the contrary: was such a disobedience,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102637:71"/>
as for circumstances of aggravation could hardly be
parallell'd in that World. It deserv'd to be recorded
as a standing testimony against them that were guilty
of it, and as an eternal monument of their base un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness.
For it was no other than the fruit of
contumacious refractoriness, and bespeaks them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at the height of obstinacy, and a most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate

                  </gap>iousness.</p>
               <p>But put case the Sermons of this mighty Preacher,
had wrought so kindly and effectually, as to have
turned Mens disobedience into true repentance: would
this have altered the State of Nature, or put a stop
to its fatal tendencies? Not in the least measure. Still
the World would have stood in its Original frame;
and a change in the minds and manners of people,
would have made none in the Physical Course of
things. So that unless God had interpos'd and by
His immediate hand, given a timely check to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Wheels; they would have run directly into this
watry ruine, and what should have kept the sincerest
penitents out of it? For to suppose that GOD in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
so far, as to support the Earth by strength of
<hi>miracle,</hi> to secure it from the Flood; would be as
great a flaw in the Philosophy of this new <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis;</hi>

Old one, to hold the Deluge was caused by Creation
of Waters, and then dried up by annihilation of the
same.</p>
               <p>3. And yet if Omnipotence had not <hi>miraculously</hi>
upheld the Earth,) supposing its Inhabitants righteous
or penitent) it would have fallen heavy upon GOD
Himself. So heavy, as to have crusht the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Providence extremely. For it would have
recoiled so rudely and violently upon its Goodness;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102637:71"/>
and so shamefully Eclipsed and blasted its Justice:
as to have brought its very <hi>Being</hi> into question. And
we may certainly conclude, that an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of this
Nature, which would weigh out the Portion of
Men, with so inequal a Ballance, as to make ruine
the lot of a righteous or repenting World; instead
of gagging or silencing the pragmatical <hi>Atheist,</hi> by
a more clever Explication of the Deluge: would
open his Mouth wider, and but oil his virulent and
sawcy tongue, to run more glibly and rantingly on,
in his tremendous way of extravagance. For what
can m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re encourage so wicked a person, than to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage
and lessen GOD's Goodness and Equity?
And how can those At<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ributes be more disgraced and
diminished (in the Judgment of an <hi>Atheist</hi>) than
by supposing that in the Works of His Providence
(through the whole <hi>Series</hi> of which he could look
with a clear and easy prospect; and so nothing of
oversight could mingle with them) He laid a cruel
Train of inavoidable Death, for Millions of his
Innocent or Penitent Creatures.</p>
               <p>How little this would have comported with those
His illustrious and Cardinal Properties, and how
much it would have blemisht and dishonored them;
we may guess from hence: in that when he was
minded to overthrow <hi>Sodom,</hi> and in his Holy Agents
was come down from Heaven on purpose to do it;
He would have spar'd it for the sake of Ten righteous
Persons. And truly if He had destroyed the righteous
with the wicked; He must have done a thing (in
the sense of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>raham</hi>) not at all agreeable, to the
Integrity of the Judge of all the Earth. (Especially
in those Ages, when Spiritual Encouragements to
GOD's Service, and recompences of it, being not
so frequently dispensed; and the Eternal ones not
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102637:72"/>
so fully revealed: the Divine favour was more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
measured and expressed to Men, by tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and outward Blessings and deliverances.) And
therefore that He abhorred such inequitable Dealings,
he was pleased to evidence by the contrary Procedure.
For when He consumed that accursed Town, he
saved just <hi>Lot</hi> by the Ministery of Angels. Nor
could He endure that <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ah</hi> should perish, being
righteous; but took particular care for his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
preservation, when the whole World, besides
Him, and his Family, was drowned.</p>
               <p>But then so much less reason there is, to admit
<hi>this Hypothesis;</hi> for that it makes the Earth (at first)
of such a Form; and puts Nature into such a Frame;
as would have involv'd Mankind in most horrid
Destruction. And not only so, but moreover makes
Providence accessary to their Perdition; yea, the
principal and sole Contriver of it, by making the
place of their Habitation, a perfect Trap to vast
multitudes of them: whereby (without a Miracle)
they must certainly have been taken and quite undone,
had they been never so pure, or never so penitent.</p>
               <p>Should it be suggested, that GOD foresaw the
impiety and incorrigibleness of Men; and so in way
of just judgment, ordered Nature, and timed the
Earth's Dissolution accordingly: this would give
little satisfaction to the <hi>Atheist</hi> (the <hi>silencing</hi> of whose
<hi>Cavils</hi> the <hi>Theory</hi> seems to aim at.) For he would
take it at best, but for a smooth Evasion, or a slim
Subterfuge; or for a sorry kind of Fetch to help the
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> at a dead lift. Nor need we doubt but
a <hi>Lucian</hi> or an <hi>Hobbs,</hi> would raise as considerable
Objections against this <hi>New way</hi> of explaining the Flood,
as against the Old one. And would insist as tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
upon that <hi>Particular</hi> now mentioned, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102637:72"/>
cavil as much, and as justly at it; as at the difficulty
or unsolvableness of any single <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> in the

is this: There is a Clause in it, that will by no means
suffer it to be interpreted the <hi>Theorist</hi>'s way. Namely,
<hi>this they are willingly ignorant of.</hi> And of what were
they thus ignorant? Why, of the Nature of the
first Heavens and Earth, and of the alterations that
befel them at the time of the Flood. So we are
assured.<note n="†" place="margin">Theor. p. 47, 48.</note> 
                  <hi>The Apostle tells them, that they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
ignorant of the first constitution of the Heavens
and the Earth, and of that change and dissolution which
happen'd to them in the Deluge.</hi> But if St. <hi>Peter</hi> meant
these things, I dare boldly say, that his charge was
too smart and heavy upon the Men; yea, false and
unreasonable. For though <hi>ignorant</hi> of the things
they might well be; yet how could they be WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LINGLY
ignorant of them? Must not that be hard
to make out?</p>
               <p>Let us try, but as to one of the mentioned heads,
the FORM of the Earth. By what means should
they have come to the knowledge of <hi>that,</hi> though
they would never so fain have done it? GOD had
not reveled it, nor had Man apprehended it. And
how then could their ignorance in the case be <hi>wilfull?</hi>
In what Books was this Form of the Earth recorded?
Or what lively Tokens or Monuments were there
of it? Whence should they have gathered it? Or
where should they have met with Intelligence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it? To say that Hills and Valleys, and
Mountains and Rocks; that the Clifts of the Sea,
and its Deeps and Chanels; that the rugged and
broken Surface of the Ground, or any thing of that
nature, might have informed them of it: would be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102637:73"/>
but wild and extravagant talk. For besides that
these Scoffers whom the Apostle reproves, had no
reason to believe, that the aforesaid <hi>Phaenomenaes</hi>
were marks or Footsteps of a ruinated Earth: so if
by chance they had phansied them such, they might
still have been far from a right <hi>Idaea</hi> of its supposed
primitive frame. A man may view and review an
heap of Rubbish, which was once an house, very
long and often; and yet be never the more able at
last, to pronounce what Model the Fabric was of.
In like manner, the most curious Surveys and reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
observations of things, in that confused posture
wherein the Earth presents them to the eye; could
never have led those the Apostle disputes against, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a right apprehension of this its Figure, which the
<hi>Theory</hi> makes it of before the Flood.</p>
               <p>Had there been fair Indications of such a Form,
why did they not direct Men into an <hi>earlier</hi> Discovery
thereof? For touching it we find not one word in
Antiquity. Yet Mountains, and Rocks, and the
like <hi>Deformities</hi> in Nature (as we are taught to think
them) were altogether as visible ever since the Deluge,
as they are now. And when none of the most search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prying minds; none of the most busy, intelligent
Speculators; were ever so quick-sighted as to decry
this Form of the Earth; from the aforesaid (imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
Irregularities, or any other hints or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of it: it was certainly a thing too obscure,
to fall under the notice of those Heretical Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
deservedly reprehended by the HOLY
GHOST. But then how could He rebuke them,
for being <hi>wilfully</hi> ignorant of it, it being so very

                  <hi>Wilfull Ignorance,</hi> is that which GOD blames,
and which is really faulty upon <hi>our</hi> account: which
we carelessly rest in when we might come out of.
When Men might have means of knowledge, but
will not seek them; or when they actually have
them, but will not use them; but in the midst of
proper helps to science, sit down and chuse to acquiesce
in Ignorance; this is <hi>wilfull</hi> and affected. But these
were not the circumstances of those, whom we find
to have been Objects of the Apostolical Censure. They
were so far from standing fair for acquaintance with
this structure of the Earth, or from being in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102637:74"/>
way to the knowledge of it; that they were
next door to an utter impossibility of ever attaining
it, supposing it had been real. For their Minds were
set (I may say) with a contrary Biass, and it was
morally necessary that they should be drawn the other
way. For the whole World was of that Judgment,
it is of <hi>now,</hi> and which these Mockers were of <hi>then:</hi>
and why should they differ from all people then alive,
or that ever lived? <hi>It hath been generally thought or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd</hi>
(says the<note n="*" place="margin">Page 276.</note> 
                  <hi>Theory) that the World before the
Flood, was of the same Form or Constitution with the
present World.</hi> And how could they help swimming
with the general Stream? Yea, which is more, the
Opinion was as <hi>Strong,</hi> as it was <hi>general;</hi> and stood
very firmly in Mens apprehensions, they thinking
it built upon Scripture Grounds. For that speaks
of Seas created in the <hi>beginning,</hi> and of Mountains
covered with Water in the Deluge. And all agreeing,
that the Seas mentioned by <hi>Moses,</hi> were no other
than those which are now extant; and that the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
so covered, were praeexistent to the Flood: the

use to evince the Earth was of another Form once; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a great Argument to perswade these Scorners,
that it was always of the Form which it now bears;
and a means to fix them in that Perswasion. And
when their condition was such, as to be destitute of
the knowledge of the Form of the Earth; and the
most likely means they had to help them to it, would
rather have run them upon the contrary belief, and
rivetted them fast in it; there could be no reason
why they should be charged with <hi>Wilfull</hi> ignorance
of the thing. And if they could not upon just grounds
be charged. with <hi>Wilfull</hi> ignorance of the Form of
the Earth; then neither with the like ignorance
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102637:75"/>
of the Constitution of the Heavens, and of the
Change and Dissolution that happened to either: they
being things as much in the dark, and as far removed
out of the way of their notice. Let us but just point
at each of them.</p>
               <p>The whole Superficies of the Terrestrial Globe
was entire and continued, smooth and even, regular
and level. No Lake nor Sea, no Rock nor Island,
no Hill nor Dale, was any where upon it. But
as the Earth was made of two distinct Orbs; so
betwixt its outward Orb of an Oval figure, <hi>and</hi> that
within; was the great Body of the Waters lodg'd
and shut up so close, as to hold no commerce with
the open Air. Such in gross was the Form and
constitution of the first Earth.</p>
               <p>The Sun piercing through the outward Orb of
the Earth, drew up (chiefly about the Middle parts
of it) great quantities of Vapours, out of the Abyss.
Which Vapours directing their Courses in the Air,
from the Aequinoctial to the Polar Regions; they
were there condensed into Rains, to furnish the
World with Rivers. But these streams of Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
flowing continually through the Aereal Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
made them exceeding watry. And such in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
was the Form or Constitution of the Heavens.</p>
               <p>The Sun moving always in the Aequinoctial, the
Earth grew extremely dry about the Aequator, and
full of Chaps; which rendred it more weak and
brittle in its exterior Orb. Which Orb being fill'd
with Vapours within, raised by the penetrating
heat of the Sun, was still more apt to be blown
up and broken. At length being able to hold no
longer, it flew in pieces, and down it fell into the
Deep beneath, sinking till it rested on the Orb below.
Such in short, was the Earth's Dissolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:102637:75"/>
By the fall of <hi>that</hi> into the Waters under it, <hi>they</hi>
were forced violently to fly up aloft; and surging
and raging in a tumultuous manner, the great and
fatal Deluge was caused. Hence also Seas and Lakes
arose, while the watry Element abating of its fury,
quietly retired into such hollownesses as were ready
to receive it. And whereas the external Orb of
Earth, was so much bigger than that within,
as to contain the whole Mass of Water in its
Cavity; and so could not possibly surround and sit
close to the inward lesser one, in an orbicular fashion
about it; but several of its parts in several places,
were fain to stand erect inclining, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these various
Prominencies of different sizes, shapes, and situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
made Mountains and Rocks of all sorts. But
the Outward Earth being thus dissolved, and fallen
as low into the Waters as it could; it was no more
liable to a general Flood, but was certainly put
past that danger for ever. And thus <hi>Its</hi> Form and
Constitution was altered.</p>
               <p>Now the Sun also running a new course about the
Earth, by reason she had changed her old Position;
and the Abyss being disordered by the Disruption of
the Earth, and its falling into it: Vapours could
no longer be drawn out from thence as they used to
be, nor fill the Aereal channels with store of Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
And so they growing dry, the watry
Complexion of the Heavens perish'd; and <hi>Their</hi>
Constitution was changed also.</p>
               <p>Such in brief (so far as we are concern'd to note at
present) was the Form and Constitution of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and the Earth; and such the changes they both
underwent, as the <hi>Theory</hi> teaches. If therefore the
Parties <hi>S. Peter</hi> reproves, were blamed for not
knowing <hi>the first constitution of the Heavens and the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102637:76"/>
Earth, and that change and dissolution which happened
to them in the Deluge;</hi> their ignorance of <hi>those Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
rehearsed</hi> must be the Summ of their Charge.
But then all those things being perfectly new; such
as neither <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> nor <hi>Plato,</hi> nor <hi>Aristotle,</hi> nor
<hi>Zeno,</hi> nor any Philosophers of any Sect or Age, did
understand and declare: how can it be thought that
silly <hi>Gnostics</hi> or Pseudo-Christians could be acquainted
with them? And yet if they could not, then neither
could they be condemned of <hi>wilfull</hi> ignorance of
them; nor can the Text be applied to the <hi>Theory</hi>'s
<hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But if this were not S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Drift; if it
were not his intent to rebuke them for their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of these things; what then could be the scope
of his correption? I answer. Though he could not
give them this gird for their being ignorant of the
<hi>Flood;</hi> yet he might do it properly for their being
ignorant of the <hi>Chief Cause</hi> of it. Ignorant of the
Flood they could not be, it was a thing so well
known, and so generally received in the Church.
That the Heavens were of old, and the Earth stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the water and in the water; and that in
their standing thus, the then World was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed
with water, and perished: they could not
be chargeable with ignorance of this. But the stress
or Emphasis of the Apostles charge lies here, that
they were ignorant of its being done <hi>by the Word of
GOD. The Heavens were of old,</hi> says he, <hi>and the
Earth standing out of the Water,</hi> and in the water,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>by the word of GOD.</hi> And then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>by which</hi> (that is, by which situation,
and by which word of GOD causing it) <hi>the World
that then was being overflowed with water, perished.</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:102637:76"/>
So that <hi>this seems</hi> to have been their fault, that they
had not a true notion of the principal Cause of the
Deluge. But through their own heedlesness, were
much in the dark and mightily to seek as to that
particular. They did not know, because they
would not; that GOD brought it in by the word of
his power; or in pursuance of that righteous decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Sentence, denounced by him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. They
were of opinion (as others have been) that the Flood
was a meer <hi>casual</hi> thing; and that the hand of
GOD was no otherwise in it, than in the purest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent
Calamities. Or else that it proceeded wholly
from Nature and Second Causes; as from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
and influence of watry Planets. However
they might think it was of larger extent, and longer
Duration; they might ascribe it to no higher Cause,
than some do the Flood of <hi>Ogyges,</hi> that happened in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia;</hi>
or that of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> which drowned <hi>Thessaly.</hi>
Concerning the latter of which, <hi>Lucan</hi> thus phansied.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Deucalioneos</hi> fudisset <hi>Aquarius</hi> imbres.</l>

                     <hi>Aquarius</hi> 'twas that made those rains pour down,</l>
                  <l>Which in <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s time the Earth did drown.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>He plainly imputed it to Astral efficiency, or the
force of the heavenly Constellations. Now if these
Men thought thus vainly of the general Innunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and knew it not to be the Effect of the special
Providence of GOD: they were grossly ignorant
in the Case, and this their ignorance was grievous
<hi>wilfull,</hi> and deserved the holy reproof they met with.
For had they but consulted the Story of it, and
considered what <hi>Moses</hi> says concerning it; they
would soon have perceived, it was the direful issue
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102637:77"/>
of divine power and justice, and came not by the
influence of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ars, but by the appointment of
the DEITY.</p>
               <p>And that to condemn this very ignorance, was
the real meaning of S. <hi>Peter</hi> seems to be clear from
its agreeableness to his aim or intention. Which
was to prove the World's Conflagration upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Men who question'd the same, and disputed
against it by this Argument, that <hi>all things continued
as they were from the beginning</hi> (whereby they hardned
themselves against the Doctrine of the Conflagration,
in which the Apostle threatned them with a dismal
<hi>Catastrophe.</hi>) Now how does the Apostle answer
and take off this? Why by fetching a compass about
in his Discourse, and by telling them (though not
in these words,) to this purpose: that when the World
was to be <hi>drowned,</hi> all things continued <hi>then</hi> as they
were from the beginning; and Nature did not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
it beforehand, by any sensible observable Changes,
because the work was not to be naturally done, but
<hi>by the Word of GOD</hi> commanding and causing it:
which to be ignorant of, was their great fault. And
therefore that in their time, <hi>all things conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
as they were from the beginning,</hi> ought to be
no reason to them, that the World shall not be <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;</hi>
because it is not to be expected, that Nature
should foreshow it by any pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vious alterations: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
much as this <hi>Burning,</hi> is no more to be effected in
a natural way, than the Deluge was; but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>by the same Word</hi> which drowned the World, and by
which <hi>the Heavens and the Earth which are now, are
reserved unto fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were it necessary in the least, after what has been
said; it might here be noted, that the words are
very capable of, and might properly be expounded
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102637:77"/>
to <hi>another</hi> sense. <hi>This they are willingly ignorant of:</hi>
That is, <hi>they are willingly <hi>mindless or forgetfull</hi>
                  </hi> of
it. For so <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, may signify (which in the case
the Apostle speaks to, must be an hainous fault,
and worthy of reprehension) and therefore a thing
<hi>forgotten,</hi> is said <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
, &amp;c. <hi>as no time could bring into oblivion,</hi> or
blot out of remembrance. Tho' still there would
be as little reason to charge these Heretics, with <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
forgetfulness</hi> of <hi>those things</hi> that the <hi>Theory</hi> would
make the Text point at; as there is to check them
for <hi>wilfull ignorance</hi> of the same.</p>
               <p>3. Besides this of <hi>S. Peter,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Theor. p. 86.</note> 
                  <hi>other places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
seem manifestly to describe this same</hi> (new) <hi>form
of the Abyss with the Earth above it;</hi> as we are
told. But as all those places may as <hi>well</hi> or <hi>better</hi>
be applied to the Earth in its <hi>present</hi> form; so they
can hardly be interpreted in favour of <hi>this other,</hi>
without some kind of violence or absurdity.</p>
               <p>The First occurrs <hi>Psal. 24. 2. He hath founded
it</hi> (the Earth) <hi>upon the Seas, and established it upon
the Floods.</hi> Where, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> rendred, <hi>upon,</hi> does as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
signify, <hi>by,</hi> And so, He founded it <hi>by</hi> the Seas,
and established it <hi>by</hi> the Floods. Which <hi>David</hi> might
the rather note, because so much of <hi>Palestine,</hi> (where he
lived) lay along by the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> Though when
our Learned Translators turned the word <hi>upon;</hi> they
made it speak most true <hi>English.</hi> For where land
lies <hi>by</hi> the Sea, we commonly say, it lies <hi>upon</hi> it.</p>
               <p>But then on the other side, the Earth, according
to its first (imagined) form, could in strictness be
founded neither <hi>upon</hi> the Seas, nor yet <hi>by</hi> them;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102637:78"/>
because no Seas were <hi>then</hi> in being, but only an
<hi>Abyss.</hi> Should it be answered, that the Abyss is
here called Seas, by a <hi>Prolepsis;</hi> I rejoin: Those
Seas must then be called, Floods, by another <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sis.</hi>
And so the advantage will be cast on <hi>our</hi> side.
For in respect of the present form of the Earth, the
words may be expounded most naturally, without
a Figure: but in reference to the other form, they
must not only be strained up to a Figure, but that
Figure must be twice made use of. And which is
very considerable, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> rendred, <hi>Floods;</hi> does
signify <hi>Rivers;</hi> and so the LXX, and <hi>Vulgar</hi> do
both render it. And though that sense falls in most
properly with the present form of the Earth, as it
is every where extended by Rivers; yet it can by
no means hold with its <hi>first form,</hi> supposing it esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
upon the Abyss: for in that (allowing there
were <hi>Floods</hi>) there could be no <hi>Rivers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the next place, <hi>Psal. 136. 6. Who stretched
out the Earth above the Waters,</hi> We need say no more
than has been said already. It may as well be read <hi>juxta
aquas, by</hi> the waters, as, <hi>super aquas, above</hi> the waters.</p>
               <p>The Third pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e is, <hi>Psal. 33. 7. He gathered the
waters of the Sea as in a Bagg, He layeth up the Abysses
in Storehouses.</hi> Which, says the Theory,<note n="*" place="margin">Page. 86.</note> 
                  <hi>answers
very fitly and naturally to the place and disposition of the
Abyss which it had before the Deluge, inclosed within
the Vault of the Earth, as in a Bagg or in a Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house.</hi>
But I say it sutes the present form of the
Earth as well as it does the first: only this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.

not only <hi>open,</hi> (as other Seas are now) but much
more open than ever. For it speaks of it at that

Verse testifies. And whereas the <hi>Theorist</hi> notes, that
<hi>the Oriental Versions and Paraphrase,</hi> render the word

the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s words that I have cited. Which if they

which concludes the Paragraph belonging to that

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Page 87.</note> 
                  <hi>I think it
cannot but be acknowledged, that those Passages which we
have instanced in, are more fairly and aptly understood of
the ancient form of the Sea, or the Abyss, as it was enclosed
within the Earth; than of the present form of it in an open
Chanel.</hi> But then that Passage in <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 13. (being
parallel to <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 7. so far as we are concerned in it)
must be acknowledged to be most fairly and aptly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
of the <hi>Red Seas being enclosed within the
Earth,</hi> when <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews</hi> marched through
it: and could that be?</p>
               <p>The next place is <hi>Iob 26. 7. He stretcheth out the
North over the empty places, and hangeth the Earth
upon nothing.</hi> The same is as true of the <hi>South</hi>
also; but the good Man living in this Hemisphere,
the <hi>North</hi> was the nearer and more obvious of the
two. And what could be mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> agreeable to the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102637:79"/>
present Earth? For it having no visible sensible thing
under it or about it, to shoar it up or support it;
it may very well seem in common apprehension; and be
said in the vulgar way of speaking, to be stretcht
out upon emptiness, and hanged upon nothing.
And so the Sun stood still upon <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and the
Moon in the Valley of <hi>Ajalon:</hi> though the places
were without the <hi>Tropic.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Josh. 10. 12.</note> And however <hi>Iob</hi> in
this Expression, might accommodate himself to the
ordinary Phancy and speech of Men, while he
represents the Earth as extended and pendent over
an immense vacuity; yet (to cry quit with the
<hi>Theory,</hi> which makes an illiterate Apostle, a profound
Philosopher; let me say) in the truth of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was a perfect <hi>Platonist.</hi> For in this matter
(whensoever he lived) he fully agrees with <hi>Plato</hi>'s
Doctrine. For <hi>he</hi> also conceived the <hi>Earth to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e
hanged upon nothing,</hi> as having no other Prop to
sustain it, but its own figure and equiponderancy;
by which it swims evenly in the Element about
it. In testimony of this (and so of the mutual
concent betwixt <hi>Iob</hi> and him) let this Passage out
of his <hi>Phaedo</hi> speak.<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>I am perswaded that if the
Earth be but in the midst of the Heavens, it needs
not the air, nor any other help of the like nature, to
keep it from falling. But that a general equality of
the Heaven in it self, and an even-poizedness of the
Earth, is sufficient. For an Equilibrious thing placed
in a sutable</hi> (or similar) medium, <hi>will not sway
any way little or much; but keeping it self evenly</hi> (bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced)
<hi>is free from inclination.</hi>

               <p>

But in this New <hi>Hypothesis, Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi>'s notion can have
no place. For to say, the Earth, according to that,
was stretcht out upon emptiness, and hanged upon
nothing; would be notoriously false. For the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory</hi>
teaches that it<note n="*" place="margin">Page 58.</note>

                  <note n="†" place="margin">Page 61.</note> and <hi>could not have been formed unless by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion

                  <hi>mass of Waters</hi> as a <hi>basis or foundation
to rest upon.</hi> And so the Antediluvian Earth was
no more stretcht out upon emptiness, and hang'd
upon nothing; than an Arch is, when it is built
upon its Center. And it was but just now that the
<hi>Theory</hi> contended from that Passage in the 24. <hi>Psalm,</hi>
that it was founded upon the Seas, and established
upon the Floods. But how then could it be stretched
out upon emptiness and hanged upon nothing? Or
how can the two Texts, in the <hi>Theory</hi>'s sense, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled?</p>
               <p>In case it be answered, That though the Earth at
the very first was not stretcht out upon emptiness,
and hanged upon nothing; yet in process of time
it was so, when the Abyss was sunk in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
by reason of the huge quantity of Waters the
Sun had drawn out of it; and so the Earth sat
hollow about it: I reply in short, <hi>Iob</hi> for certain
meant no other than this present Earth: For in the
very next Verse, he speaks of <hi>thick Clouds</hi> in which
Waters were bound up, and they not rent. And such
Clouds (according to the <hi>The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ry</hi>) there could never
be, till the first Earth was dissolved.</p>
               <p>A Fifth place is <hi>Iob 38. 4, 5, 6. Where wast thou
when I laid the foundations of the Earth? declare, if
thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures.
thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the
line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102637:80"/>
fastened? Or who laid the corner stone thereof?</hi> This
likewise answers as properly, and perhaps more fully,
to the present real form of the Earth; than to the
other fictitious one. For GOD is here said to have
laid the foundations of it. Which surely he may
as properly be supposed to have done, in case he
produced it by immediate Creation; as if there had
been only matter and motion, and the power of
gravity and levity in the Architecture of it; and so
its formation had been meerly mechanical, as the <hi>

               <p>And then <hi>the measures</hi> and <hi>the line</hi> that are here

And may not this Earth, in those regards be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

them, if not beyond them. Indeed it has not that
smoothness and entireness, which is pretended to
have been in the first Earth. But then (which
is more considerable) it has the raised work, of
Hills; the Embossings, of Mountains; the Enamel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
of lesser Seas; the Open-work, of vast Oceans;
and the Fret-work, of Rocks. To say nothing of
those stately Curtains over-head (wanting hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
which are frequently drawn and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But, not to run out into endless Particulars, this

<hi>that imaginary</hi> one, in Two general and chief things,
<hi>Comelin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>First, in <hi>Comeliness;</hi> For irregularities many times
make a sort of Ornaments; and those ruggednesses
and inequalities that are void of all exactness and
order, do often pass for Beauties or a kind of Pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness.
But then more especially may they do so in the
<hi>Earth,</hi> whose natural pulchritude is made up of such
things as Art would call rudenesses; and consists in
asymetries and a wild variety. And yet for an
Earth, it is most beautiful and comely still. Thus
an Urchin may be handsom in his kind, though he
has not the beauty of a Dog; and a Dog, though
he has not the beauty of an Horse; and an Horse,
though he has not the beauty of a Man. And so
is this Earth, though it has not the beauty of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iner
things in it, but only that which is peculiar to it
self. For as the beauty of the Sun, lies in bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and glory; and the beauty of the Sky, in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and serenity; so the beauty of the Earth, which
is a different thing, does and must needs lie in very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
instances, namely, in Seas and Lakes, and
Islands and Continents; in Flats and Prominencies,
and Plains and Protuberancies, and Hollownesses and
Convexities; in smooth and spacious Levels in some
places, and Hills and Mountainous Roughnesses in
others. Whose careless diversifications, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
mixtures, as they mutually set off
one another; so they all conspire to adorn the Earth:
Insomuch that to suppose it of the prediluvian
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102637:81"/>
From, would be rather to detract from its <hi>measures,</hi>
than improve them. Yea, it would be in a manner
to make it no Earth, or at least not so perfect a one as
it is. For as we can have no Camels without Bunches;
nor Mules without Hairs; nor Fowls without Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
or if we could, they would be but the more
imperfect: so were the Earth abstracted from its
aforesaid appendages, however it might have the more
uniformity in it, yet as an Earth, it would have the less
<hi>comeliness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Somewhat to inforce this, Were a Man to contrive
a Prospect for himself, we may be sure he would
not have it all of a piece, or alike throughout:
but would have it cast into Swamps and Hillocks,
Bottoms and Gibbosities, Evennesses and Asperities;
yea, into Seas and Ilets, and Rocks, if it could be;
and so it would be an Image, not of the primitive,
but present Earth. A petty Argument to prove,
that there is something of perfection, or at least of
pleasingness, in this Earth's disorder (if we may
call it so) and that it is fitter to gratifie its principal
Inhabitants (and so far) better in it self, than if it
had been regular and undiversified. And the truth
is, several of those appearances, which we are apt
to call <hi>rude, confused</hi> and <hi>uncouth;</hi> and to count but
Blemishes, Scars and Deformities; are commonly so
well placed and suted to one another, as to become

be as the Tornings, and Carvings, and ornamental
Sculptures; that make up the Lineaments and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Nature, not to say her Braveries. Nor
need we wonder that the <hi>Theorist</hi> should be so
mightily pleased and raised, by the sight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of these things; for though some would
take them for flaws and botches, and the fag ends
of Nature; yet in them, a quick and piercing
Eye can easily discern, not only <hi>her</hi> pretty dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Mechanisms; but the marvellous and adoreable
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102637:82"/>
Skill of her <hi>Maker,</hi> most rarely expressed. And
therefore the inspired <hi>Psalmist,</hi> meditating upon the
Earth in its <hi>present Form;</hi> and particularly revolving
in his Holy Thoughts, the <hi>Mountains,</hi> the <hi>high Hills,</hi>
the <hi>Rocks,</hi> and the <hi>great and wide Sea;</hi> was so taken
with them, that he could not but think they had GOD
for the cause or Author of them. And accordingly
he declared and proclaimed the worst of them, not
only to be produced by him; but to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of his infinite Wisdom. <hi>O LORD in <hi>wisdom</hi>
hast thou made them <hi>all,</hi>
                  </hi> Psal. 104. 24. And when
the Divine Wisdom brought forth the Earth and
these pieces of it, and ordered them into their
present places and postures; and so admirably well,
as that the Psalmist, directed by the Heavenly
SPIRIT, could not chuse but celebrate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
and disposition of them: has not <hi>this</hi> Earth
as much to shew for its being made by <hi>Rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and
Measure,</hi> as <hi>another</hi> of a pretended different Form,
could have had? especially when it must all over
have been but one vast Plain.</p>
               <p>And then, in the Second place, this Form of the Earth
is most <hi>Vseful</hi> likewise. It appears to be so in sundry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
and very considerable ones.</p>
               <p>For now a <hi>great part</hi> of Mankind live by the
Seas, either in way of Traffick or Navigation: not
to say that <hi>all</hi> are some way or other the better
for them. But in the First World, says the <hi>Theory,</hi>
there was no Sea.</p>
               <p>Mountains also now are most eminently service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
That is to say, in Bounding Nations; in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
Kingdoms; in Deriving Rivers; in Yielding
Minerals; and in breeding and harbouring innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
wild Creatures. I might also add, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
somewhat towards enlarging the Earth,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102637:83"/>
and inabling it, in some Countries, to sustain its
Inhabitants. Thus it is alledged as one Reason
why <hi>Palestine</hi> could maintain so many of old: that
<hi>the Country was rising and falling into Hills and Vales,
whereby ground was g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ined, and so the Land was far
roomthier,</hi> to use my<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Fuller</hi>'s Holy War, l. 1. c. 18.</note> Author's Phrase. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that there were store of Hills in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and
very fruitful ones, is insinuated by the Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
where he calls upon Men to give praise to
GOD, for<note n="†" place="margin">Psal. 147. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>making Grass to grow upon the
<hi>Mountains.</hi>
                  </hi> But in the first Earth there were no
Mountains neither.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The Earth in its present Form and State,
is attended with Rains and seasonable Showres.
Whereas in its other Figure and capacity, it must
have been all over cut into Rills and Aqueducts,
for the Watring of Mens Grounds; and their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in doing it would have been endless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable,
because it must generally have been done
by hand. What Tongue can express the toil they
must have had, in a manual watring of Fields,
Woods, Groves, Orchards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in slicing a
great part of the Earth in pieces, thus to moisten
and cultivate the rest? But now kind Nature saves
them that labour, while Clouds do the work ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
for them. For they filling their Buckets
by the help of the Sun, and then emptying the
same to the best advantage; excuse them from the
drudgery, by taking it upon themselves. And that
these Rules whereby we measure the <hi>Vsefulness</hi> of
this Earth, and shew it to be more excellent than
that of the <hi>Theory;</hi> are the most true and proper
Rules: is manifest from GOD's making use of the
same in a Case not unlike: For he comparing <hi>Egypt</hi>
and <hi>Palestine,</hi> prefers the latter before the former;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102637:83"/>
because in <hi>Egypt</hi> the Seed sown was <hi>watered with
the foot as a garden of herbs;</hi> but <hi>Palestine</hi> was a
<hi>land of hills and valleys, and drank water of the rain
of heaven,</hi> Deut. 11. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>So that if an Earth most <hi>comely</hi> and decent in it
self, and also most <hi>Vseful</hi> and convenient for Men;
may most properly be said, to be <hi>laid in measures,</hi>
and to have had <hi>the line stretched upon it,</hi> or the
Rule applied to it (as questionless it may) than
the <hi>present</hi> Form of the Earth, may challenge this
Text more justly to it self, than the <hi>other</hi> could do, had
it ever been.</p>
               <p>And however the Architecture of <hi>that,</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to surpass the Architecture of <hi>this;</hi> yet
one thing may here be remarked concerning it,
That the Holy Man's Language does but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently</hi>
sute it. For to talk of <hi>Foundations,</hi>
in such a <hi>Circle;</hi> or of a <hi>Corner-stone,</hi> in such
a spherical <hi>Arch,</hi> as the primitive Earth is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be; sounds but harshly.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Place consists of the 8, 9, 10, and 11<hi>th</hi>
Verses of the same Chapter, where GOD conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
his Interrogatories thus, <hi>Or who shut up the Sea
with Doors, when it brake forth as if it had issued out
of a Womb? When I made the Cloud the garment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and thick darkness a swadling band for it, and brake
up for it my decreed plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and set bars and doors.
And said, Hitherto shalt thou come but no farther,
and here shall thy proud waves be staied.</hi> Which
Period the <hi>Theory</hi> would have to be understood,
of the breaking forth of the Sea, at the opening of
the Abyss; but the Context allows it not. For
that plainly signifies, that what the Sea is here said to
do, and what is said to be done to that, was transacted
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102637:84"/>
in the beginning; when the Foundations of the
Earth were fastened, and the corner-stone thereof
was laid, and the morning Stars sang, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
therefore when the <hi>Theory</hi> would put a difference
(in respect of time) betwixt the foregoing (4,
5, and 6<hi>th)</hi> Verses, and those last set down; so
as to make the Questions in the former Verses,
<hi>proceed upon the Form and construction o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the first
Earth;</hi> and those in the latter, <hi>upon the demolition
of that Earth, the opening of the Aby<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state of both:</hi> what it says, is <hi>gratis di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tum,</hi>
and the distinction groundless. Yea, it seems not
only to be applied without grounds, but with
force and violence; for the Context intimates no
such matter, but rather the contrary. It runs on
in a direct <hi>series</hi> of Queries, without giving the
least hint, that any of the Particulars touching
which they are made, were of later date than others.
And that the first <hi>set</hi> of them, relate to things as
ancient as the Primitive Earth's Production, the
<hi>Theory</hi> owns; and therefore why should not the
other too?</p>
               <p>To which add, when the Sea brake forth at the
time of the disruption, it could not be said to issue
as out of a Womb, so properly, as out of its House
(where it had dwelt above Sixteen hundred Years;)
for a Womb is the place where a thing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and brought into being, which before <hi>was</hi>
not. But these Waters were preexistent to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure
of the Abyss, the Womb which held them;
yea against the order of Nature, they were contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive
to the being of it, as they were the <hi>basis</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the First Earth was built. So that the place
of the Abyss falls in but ill with the notion of a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102637:84"/>
                  <hi>Womb,</hi> in reference to these Waters; And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they could as ill be said to issue from thence
<hi>as out of a Womb.</hi> And then the <hi>Darkness</hi> at the
Disruption was not so <hi>thick,</hi> nor so much a <hi>garment</hi>
or <hi>swadling band</hi> to the Sea, as darkness was at the
Creation. Yea, the truth is, it could then be no
garment or swadling band at all for the <hi>Sea,</hi> but
only for the <hi>Flood.</hi> For by that time the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary
Waters of the Deluge, were quietly retired
into the <hi>decreed place,</hi> and became a <hi>Sea;</hi> the Sky
was cleared up, and the darkness gone. Nor could
it so properly be said to be <hi>shut up with Doors,</hi>
and to have <hi>Bars set upon it</hi> then, as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchized
or set at liberty. For those Doors and
Bars which shut it up, and made it fast in a closer
state before the Disruption, were then all broken
down and thrown open for ever, and it was put
into a condition of far greater freedom than it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had; its present settlement, being perfectly a
state of enlargement to it.</p>
               <p>But now turn the words to the sense of the
Old <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and (besides that they keep time
exactly with the Context) how patly do they fall
in with it? For when on the First Day, GOD
(together with the Earth) made the Water of the
Sea; as <hi>it brake forth</hi> into being, <hi>as if it had issued
out of a Womb</hi> indeed, because it just then gushed
out of the <hi>Womb</hi> of <hi>nothing,</hi> into Existence: and
as he then <hi>made the Cloud the garment thereof, and
thick darkness a swadling band for it</hi> in a fuller
sense; for <hi>darkness was then upon the face of the deep,</hi>
Gen. 1. 1. and that darkness for certain most <hi>thick,</hi>
there being then neither Sun nor Light: so on the
Third Day, when he brake up Chanels for it, he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102637:85"/>
might well call them <hi>His decreed place,</hi> and declare
that he had beset it with <hi>Bars and Doors;</hi> because
by his command the Waters were gathered off the
surface of the Earth, where was their first and natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
situation, and shut up in such Receptacles, and with
such a confinement, as they would never have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
into of themselves; but would always have
remained in their original diffusion over the whole
Terrestrial Globe. And that this shutting up of the
Sea in its <hi>decreed place,</hi> was a thing done in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and not at the time of the Flood; is
evident, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 29. where GOD's giving his
Decree to the Sea that it should not pass his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment;
and his appointing the foundations
of the Earth: are made to be S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nchronals.</p>
               <p>But from the last Verse of the Quotation, <hi>Hitherto
shalt thou come and no farther, and here shall thy proud
waves be stayed;</hi> an objection is raised against the
usual exposition of the Place. For that <hi>sentence
shews</hi> (saith<note n="*" place="margin">Page 89.</note> the <hi>Theory) that it cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of the first disposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion of the Waters as they were
before the Flood, for their proud waves broke those
bounds whatsoever they were, when they over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lowed the
Earth in the Deluge.</hi> I answer, If they did so, yet
that argues not but the words may speak the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the Waters before the Flood, according to
the common interpretation of them; for that Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
was by GOD's special appointment. And
when he assigned to the Waters the place of their
abode, he did not intend to fortifie them in it against
his own Omnipotence, or to devest himself of his
Sovereign Prerogative of calling them forth when he
pleased. And when they passed the bounds he set
them, so long as they did it not by any force of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102637:85"/>
their own, but meerly by his powerful order or
providential act; this their Eruption and spreading
Overflow, cannot be lookt upon as a breach of that
Law, or those Limits he prescribed them. It was
only the marvellous effect of an extraordinary Cause;
and a particular Exception of GOD's own making,
to the general and standing Rule of his Providence.
Just as <hi>Enoch</hi>'s or <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Translation was, to the
universal and irrevocable Sentence of Death. That
may be one answer in defence of the ancient <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, to the <hi>Theorist,</hi> I may give in this for
another: The proud Waves of the Sea did never
pass their bounds to make the Deluge. The great
Deep, or the Fountains then broken up, had no
relation to the Sea; I confess this implies that the
Flood is to be explained by a new <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> but
if we can but bring in such a one, as may be as justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
as the <hi>Theory</hi>'s is (which we shall endeavour
to do) we need not concern our selves farther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The last place is</hi> Prov. 8. 27, 28. When he prepared
the Heavens, I was there; when he set a compass up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the face of the Deep: when he established the Clouds
above, when he strengthned the fountains of the Abyss.
<hi>Whence is inferred,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Theor.</hi> p. 90.</note> So there was in the beginning
of the World, a Sphere, Orb, or Arch, set round the
Abyss, <hi>which is presumed to be no other than the
first</hi> habitable Earth.</p>
               <p>But this is a sense far fetcht to serve the turn of
an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> when there is a nearer at hand will
do much better. For by the <hi>Compass</hi> set upon the
face of the Depth, is meant no more than those bounds
wherewith GOD encompassed (not the <hi>Theory</hi>'s
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102637:86"/>
                  <hi>Abyss,</hi> but) the <hi>open Waters.</hi> The HOLY GHOST
(who is the best Interpreter of his own Writings)
expounds it so by a paralled Text in <hi>Iob, He hath
compassed the waters with bounds,</hi> chap. 26. ver. 10.
Take it in the Original, and it speaks out <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
meaning to the full <gap reason="foreign">

Not upon the face of the <hi>Deep;</hi> so it might have
been catcht at, and construed an <hi>Arch</hi> upon the
<hi>inclosed</hi> Abyss: but upon the face of the <hi>Waters.</hi>
And this <hi>Compass</hi> was extant in that state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where were <hi>Thunders,</hi> and <hi>Waters in thick
Clouds</hi> (as the Context shews) neither of which
<hi>Phaenomena's</hi> could be contemporary with that Arch

it was to last <hi>until day and night come to an end.</hi>
So that if <hi>Solomon</hi>'s meaning be the same with
<hi>Iob</hi>'s; the <hi>Compass</hi> he mentions as set upon the

it cannot be that Arch which the <hi>Theory</hi> would
perswade it was, because that was down long before

               <p>And then by GOD's <hi>strengthening the fountains of

and solid; as that the Springs and Rivers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the Sea, should not ordinarily wash it
down, and so obstruct and dam up themselves.
But how on the other side, an Arch built over

<hi>Fountains</hi> of that,</hi> when not so much as one Spring,

               <p>4. Such are the Scripture-Proofs of the aforesaid
Form of the Antediluvian Earth. To take them off,
I might oppose them by many other Texts: I mean
such as are charged with counter-Metaphors; with
such Allegorical or allusive terms, as carry a sense in
them, not only different <hi>from</hi> what is suggested in the
forementioned Allegations; but inconsistent <hi>with</hi> it,
and repugnant <hi>to</hi> it. I will instance but in one; <hi>Who
shaketh the Earth out of her place, and the Pillars thereof
tremble,</hi> Job 9. 6. So that the Earth, which is one
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102637:87"/>
while said to be founded upon the Seas, and established
upon the Floods: and another while to be stretched over
empty places, and hanged upon nothing: and anon
(according to the <hi>Theory</hi>) to be a Sphere, or Circle,
or an independent Orb or Arch; is said at last to be
built upon Pillars. Whence it is manifest that the
Citations above, are but Tropical or Figurative
Schemes of speech; and so wide and indeterminate,
that nothing of strict and particular signification or
certainty, is to be lookt for in them, or concluded
from them. To do that (though I will not say
it is to trifle with Scripture) is to make it speak
what it never meant.</p>
               <p>It is said of GOD, in the cited Text, That <hi>he
shaketh the earth out of her place.</hi> Which had it
been hit upon, and that way applied, would
have been as notable an evidence for the Earth's
changing her situation in the time of the Flood (by

of the Earth's Position, improbable. 2. For then
that Position would have remained still, or the
Change thereof would have been more fully upon
Record. 3. Scripture does not favour this Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox,
but rather discountenance it. 4. It would
have kept one half of the Earth unpeopled.
5. And have hindred the Rains at the time of the
Flood. 6. The Doctrine of the Aequinox is
against the Judgment of the Learned. 7. The
Authorities alledged for the Right Situation of the
Earth, upon which the Aequinox depends, Insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to prove it. 8. Two Queries propounded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Aequinox.</head>
               <p>1. WE are now (from its <hi>form</hi>) come to the
<hi>First Property</hi> of the Antediluvian Earth,
namely, a <hi>Perpetual Aequinox</hi> by reason of its right
situation to the Sun. By which is meant that the
<hi>Axis</hi> of the Earth was always kept in a Parallelism
to that of the Ecliptic (as now it is to that of the
Aequator.) So that in her Annual motion about
the Sun, she was carried directly under the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial,
without any manner of Obliquity in her
site, or declination towards either of the <hi>Tropics</hi>
in her Course; and therefore could never cut the
Aequinoctial, by passing (as now she is presumed
to do) from one <hi>Tropic</hi> to the other. The effects of
which her regular position and motion, during the
continuance of the same; were an even and unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Temperature of the Air; a constant Spring and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102637:88"/>
unwearied fruitfulness in the Earth; and an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
tenour in the interchanging vicissitude
of Days and Nights, they being ever of a length.
But such a direct situation and course of the Earth,
is a thing very unlikely to have been.</p>
               <p>2. One reason is this; because then the same
would have remained until now; or else in the
World there would have been found a more full
account of the Change thereof. For put case the
Earth did shift her posture, and also her Circuit
about the Sun, in which she persisted till the
Deluge. Is it not odd and monstrous strange, that
we should have no more to shew for this? and that
no better footsteps of its remembrance should be
seen?</p>
               <p>Whenever this Change befell the Earth, as to its
site and yearly progress; it must needs have been
attended with a notable alteration in the <hi>Tempesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>
(to say nothing of the <hi>Astronomical</hi>) face of
things. And when they who had escaped the
common Shipwrack, came forth of the Ark; and
beheld how the days did lengthen and shorten;
and how the Year ran through such variety of
Seasons: and withal felt their Bodies so differently
affected, being one while parched with Summers
heat, and another while pinched with Winters cold;
contrary to what they had ever been before: they
could not surely but relate this surprizing Novelty
to after-Generations (as a thing most wonderful)
and they tell it to others, and they again to others:
and so some dark account of it at least, would
somewhere have been met with, amongst the broken
Records and Monuments of Antiquity, more than
now appears. Not to add, That where Providence
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102637:89"/>
does make so considerable Changes, and of so near
and important concern to Men; it does usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister
them, and give fair notice thereof to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Thus in a National concern of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
there being but one day made <hi>longer</hi> than any had
been, we find it distinctly recorded in<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 10. Ver. 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and
afterwards confirmed by the Prophet<note n="†" place="margin">Chap. 3. Ver. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Habakkuk;</hi>
And therefore had this Alteration been real, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
it should have been more fully recorded too;
especially when so fit an occasion of Chronicling it
was offered of old, when the Story of the Flood was
committed to writing.</p>
               <p>There once happened a notable Change in the
Planet <hi>Venus</hi> (the <hi>Theory</hi> has remarkt it) remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred

                  <hi>Austin.</hi> And this was said by
<hi>Adrastus Cyzicenus,</hi> and <hi>Dion Neapolites,</hi> two noble
Mathematicians, to fall out in the Reign of
<hi>Ogyges.</hi> By whom if they meant <hi>Ogyges Priscus,</hi>
who was <hi>Noah,</hi> the Date of the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> was
about the time of the Deluge. But then if a single
Change in one of the Heavenly Bodies was thus
noted, and the notice of it so plainly transmitted
to us at such a distance: then had a general Change
at the same time befallen the Heavens, the whole
aspectable Heavens, and the Earth at once; certainly
we should have heard something more concerning it
than now we do, from the famo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Ancients.</p>
               <p>Though when that Planet did (according to the
Historian) change her <hi>colour, magnitude, figure,</hi> and
<hi>course;</hi> we need not impute this (as the <hi>Theory</hi>
does) to her then present <hi>dissolution:</hi> but rather to
the disposition and temperament of the Air, which
perhaps will be able to solve all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s.
For grant but <hi>that</hi> to have been full of moist
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102637:89"/>
Vapours, and of a constitution so watry, as it never
was before nor since (which it might very well
be, and could scarce be otherwise about the time
of the Deluge) <hi>Venus,</hi> by unusual refraction of
her Beams would easily put on a different <hi>hue,</hi>
and larger <hi>Phase</hi> than she used to wear. The
same Air also might alter her <hi>shape,</hi> while the
humid <hi>medium,</hi> performing the part of a <hi>Telescope,</hi>
truly represented her <hi>gibbous, corniculate,</hi> or the
like. And then it might put her <hi>Course</hi> into seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Disorder too. For the Air above being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally
thick, and subject at times to uneven agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
as it chanced to be variously driven or
moved, might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ling the Planet into unsteddiness as
to appearance, or into a kind of fluctuating or
salient Motion in the Eyes of Spectators. And so
it might seem to be (as <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cus Varro</hi> terms it)
<hi>mirabile portentum,</hi> a wonderful monstrous thing.
But that the whole mutation or disorder which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to this Planet, is no good Argument of its
being just then dissolved; is evident from this
Passage in the Story which speaks it to have been
but <hi>temporary: Quod factum it a neque ante<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, neque
postea fit, It was never so before nor after.</hi> And
therefore still the more probable it is, that the Air
which was then so out of order too as it never was
before or after, might be the cause of all. And why
these effects should be visible only in this Planet,
there is more to be said than needs be here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted.
Let me but hint, that if the Moon were then
in Conjunction, or near it; <hi>Venus</hi> was the brightest
Luminary that shone by night, and so the fittest for
these <hi>Phaenomenas</hi> to shew forth themselves in; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

this mighty Change, when he had so fair an
occasion of doing it, in the Story of the Flood; yet
had it really happened to the World, it could not
have slipt so perfectly out of memory, as it has
done. For at the time it fell out, there wanted
not <hi>one</hi> at least, who was very well able to remark
it; and to have given occasion (by passing his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations

Learning, <hi>Noah</hi> might be rarely versed in the same;
at least he must have been so competently instructed
in it, as to have been capable of leaving a most
clear account behind him of this marvellous altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if it had happened in his time. For Books
written by <hi>Enoch,</hi> are reported to have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the Ark. And <hi>Origen</hi> affirms, That part
of these Books, containing the course of the Stars,
their names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were found in <hi>Arabia Felix.</hi> And
<hi>Tertullian</hi> avers that he had seen and perused many
Pages of them. And Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> (no bad
Historian) is so far from condemning or suspecting
the thing, that he rather vindicates it. Though
it is not to be doubted, but into them at length
many extravagancies might be inserted. Now if
these Books treated of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> says
they did; <hi>Noah</hi> could not chuse but derive good
Skill in that Science, from them. And so (by the
way) it will be easie to conceive how <hi>Abraham</hi>

strange, I say, these being <hi>Phaenomenas</hi> which of old
fell under common notice in way of Experience;
whereas the other were never so obvious and tried.
And the more strange will it seem yet, if what
was hinted before, be duly considered; namely, That
<hi>Noah</hi> might be well qualified to observe so great
and remarkable things, and to recommend the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
to his Posterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:102637:92"/>3. As for <hi>Scripture,</hi> it is so far from favouring
this <hi>Aequinox,</hi> that it does rather discountenance it.
And those words, <hi>Gen. 8. ult. while the earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth,
seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and
summer and winter, and night and day shall not
cease:</hi> instead of any change in the frame of Nature
(which the <hi>Theory</hi> would infer from them) intimate
the contrary; that things still continued in their
former State; and were not out of a more regular
and uniform, <hi>then</hi> put into a new and less orderly
course and posture, than they were in before. For,</p>
               <p>First, The words seem to look so directly the
other way, that they can scarce be made to cast an
eye on such a sense, without violent Distortion of
their natural Aspect. <hi>Noah</hi> was just now come
out of the Ark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and having so dismal a prospect
before him, so black and horrid and amazing a
Spectacle, as the utter Destruction of all Mankind,
excepting himself and seven more: this might
very well damp him extreamly, and fill him with
melancholy and sad Dejection. And then the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
apprehensions of what might yet be behind,
or happen again afterwards of the like nature;
might startle him exceedingly, and fright him into
farther Consternation. Now to support the good
Man under the weight of this double terror
and solicitude, or to take off its heavy pressure;
GOD here passeth a solemn Promise, that no such
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lood should ever drown the Earth any more.
And then in Confirmation of this Promise, adds,
That the yearly <hi>Seasons</hi> should never thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
be interrupted; which they certainly must
be, in case of such another universal Deluge. That
this was the occasion and full scope of these
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102637:92"/>
words,<note n="*" place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tiq. l. 1. c. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Iosephus</hi> attests with advantage on our
side; For he says, That <hi>Noah</hi> (upon his coming out of
the Ark) <hi>fearing lest the Earth should every year be
overflowed, offered burnt sacrifice to GOD, beseeching
him that hereafter he would entertain the <hi>ancient</hi>
order,</hi> &amp;c. To which request of his, what more
gracious or satisfactory answer could be returned,
than in the words recited? Where GOD conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
to give him assurance of what he desired, by
ingaging, That <hi>while the earth remaineth, seed time
and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and
winter, and night and day shall not cease.</hi> Where
<hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> are mentioned, as things well
known to the Patriarch, and he makes no enquiry
into the <hi>meaning</hi> of them, as having been familiarly
acquainted with them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, GOD here promiseth to <hi>Noah,</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of Mankind, That there should be <hi>Day</hi> and
<hi>Night,</hi> as well as <hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Winter;</hi> yet Day and
Night were certainly before the Flood; and if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of <hi>their</hi> continuance does not hinder but they
were before; so it argues not but that <hi>Summer</hi>
and <hi>Winter</hi> were so too. Yea, since <hi>Summer</hi> and
<hi>Winter</hi> are here settled upon the new or recovering
World, in conjunction with <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night,</hi> which
had their alternate beings ever since the Creation;
it is a good evidence that these <hi>Seasons</hi> had the
same. And the reason why both were now ensured,
is, because both were intermitted; the Rule of Day
and Night, having been broken for a while, by
continual darkness; as well as the Regularity of the
Seasons (for that fatal Year) by the prevailing Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
To which add,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:102637:93"/>Thirdly, That<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 1. 14.</note> the <hi>Lights in the Firmament of
Heaven,</hi> at the same time that they were appointed
to <hi>divide the day from the night,</hi> were moreover ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the <hi>Seasons</hi> of the Year; for so

and the Prophet expresseth them by the same<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>
                  </note> word
that <hi>Moses</hi> did. But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is annother thing, wherein
Scripture checks with this <hi>Aequinox;</hi> and that is
the effect of the Divine Malediction denounced
against the Earth. Upon Man's rebellious defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Apostasie from GOD, he cursed the Ground
for his sake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17. Whereupon it became na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
barren of good things necessary to Life; and
fruitful in useless and offensive Products. But in
case there were such an Aequinox, it will be hard
to conceive how this should be; for that Aequinox
would have kept the Heavens in a standing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varied
posture; and the stability and unchanged
influence of the Heavens, would have continued
the Air in the same benign Temperature. And
the Air being still, and warm, and balmy; that
rich and fat Earth would have been flourishing
and fruitful, pleasant and <hi>Paradisiacal</hi> (as the <hi>Theory</hi>
supposes it) a long time after <hi>Adam</hi> fell. So that
where could be barrenness? Or how did the Curse
of GOD take place? To say the Earth grew dry
and barren at last, for some ages before the Flood,
would be no answer, or at least no satisfactory one.
For besides that the heavy Curse was presently to fall
as a Punishment upon <hi>Adam;</hi> so late a barrenness
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102637:93"/>
would have been the effect of time and nature; the
unctuous juices of the primigenial Soil, which made
it a great while so vital and vegetative, being at
length exhausted. And therefore this barrenness
could not be imputed to the Curse of GOD, because
it would certainly have come on in the meer
course of things, though Man had persisted in his
original purity, and had kept the Crown of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
always upon his head.</p>
               <p>Lastly, There is a Passage in the Holy Writings,
which seems to evince, That the <hi>Air</hi> in Paradise,
had an <hi>Intemperature</hi> sent into it (perhaps the
fruit of the Curse now mentioned) about the time
that our First Parents sinned. And this again im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys,
That there was no such Aequinox. The
Passage relates to our first Parents, and occurs,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 7. Where it is said of them,
That <hi>they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ewed fig-leaves together</hi> (or
<note n="*" place="margin">So <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> properly signifies, <hi>Ioh</hi> 16. 15. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 18. For who ever <hi>sewed</hi> Sackcloth to his own Skin? or to other Mens Arm-holes?</note> 
                  <hi>fitted</hi> them together, as the <hi>Syriac</hi>
reads it) <hi>and made themselves, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
things to gird about them.</hi> Now why
did they do this? It is commonly
said, <hi>That they might cover their nakedness, whereof
they were ashamed.</hi> But this seems not to have been
the reason, at least not the whole reason of the
thing. For first, Scripture says nothing of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly;
That does not declare that they did thus
to hide their shame. Secondly, What shame need
there have been upon account of nakedness betwixt
Husband and Wife, when there were no other
People in the World? Thirdly, While they stood,
it was said of them, That <hi>they were both naked,
the man and his wife, and were not ashamed,</hi> Gen. 2.
<hi>ult.</hi> And surely when they were <hi>innocent,</hi> they
should have been most <hi>modest;</hi> and their modesty
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102637:94"/>
should have made them most ashamed of their
nakedness <hi>then,</hi> had there been shame in it. And
therefore it is probable that the <hi>Perizomata,</hi>
things to put about them, were made upon <hi>another</hi>
score; namely, To defend them from the <hi>intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Air</hi> of the <hi>Edenical</hi> Regions. And this was
as much as they at present could do for themselves.
But then afterwards (which helps to confirm our
sense) we find that <hi>the LORD GOD made
them coats of skins and cloathed them,</hi> Gen. 3. 21.
Which were to be a better defence still against the
aforesaid Inconvenience. So <hi>Lyra</hi> concludes, That
they were cloathed with Skins,<note n="a" place="margin">Quòd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digebant tegu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>because
they wanted a covering against the <hi>Intemperature
of the Air.</hi>
                  </hi> I confess he speaks of the Air in
<hi>that</hi> place <hi>ad quem erant ejiciendi, into which they
were to be cast forth.</hi> But let it be so: still it will
fight as much against this Aequinox; and imply or
infer what certainly overthrows it; that is, an Air
<hi>intemperate</hi> in the habitable Regions of the first
Earth.</p>
               <p>And (by the way) let none wonder, That
GOD, by his Angels, should stoop to so mean a
work, as the cloathing of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> with
Skins. Let us but seriously think what disparaging
things our REDEEMER JESUS the King of
Glory, has done and suffered in his adorable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for us forlorn and most unworthy sinners;
and we shall cease to marvel at this lesser conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension
of the INFINITE MAJESTY, though
it was exceeding great. Yet had it not been more
upon the account of <hi>warmth,</hi> than <hi>covering their
nakedness;</hi> such Coats need not have been made
them: their own Fig-leaves would have been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for that use. And thus Scripture does plainly
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102637:94"/>
discountenance this Aequinox, rather than favour
it in the least measure.</p>
               <p>4. But farther yet. If the Earth always wheeled
about the Sun, in a <hi>Right Situation</hi> to him; the
Terrestrial Globe, in one Hemisphere of it, must
have been <hi>unpeopled;</hi> because there could have been
no easie Passage, no way of possible access to it.
For grant <hi>Adam</hi> to have been planted on <hi>either</hi> side
of the <hi>Torrid Zone;</hi> how should <hi>he,</hi> or <hi>his,</hi> have
gone through it to the <hi>other?</hi> It would have
been so terribly heated by the roasting Sun, that no
Mortal could have travelled over it. Consider but
the <hi>breadth</hi> of this Zone: According to the Ancients
(who stretched it from one <hi>Tropic,</hi> to the other)
it was about Seven and forty Degrees wide; that
is, near Three thousand Miles. But yield it to have
been but <hi>half</hi> so broad, and what Men could ever
have marched over it? For as under their feet there
would have been vehemently hot and scalding Sands:
so the scorching fury of the glaring Sun, would
have beat intolerably upon their Heads. And then
what should have guided them through this burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tract, where was nothing of Path, or Way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
to be seen? Suppose they had the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Stars by night; yet who, or what should
have led their Caravans by day? And yet had they
journied without sure conduct, whither might
they have wandred? and to what length might
they have spun out their rangeing Progress, at the
shortest too long and tedious to be born? Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if we consider, that in those their Travels, they
could have met with no manner of shelter or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment:
No, not so much as with a Grove,
or a Tree; with a Lake, or a River; with one
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102637:95"/>
poor Fountain or Spring of Water, or a single puff
of fresh and cooling Air. And say the driest burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingest
part of this Zone, had not been above Five
hundred Miles over; yet who durst have thought
of venturing through it, as not knowing its extent?
And who that had advanced a few Furlongs into
it, could have been able to have gone forward, or
to return alive? None will be surprized at this,
that have a right Notion of the nature of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
or of the excessive degree of its raging heat.
The <hi>Theory</hi> speaks it in these words, (which, all
circumstances weighed, carry no <hi>Hyperbole</hi> in
them)<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 257.</note> 
                  <hi>It was a wall of fire indeed, or a Region of
flame, which none could pass or subsist in, no more
than in a Furnace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if <hi>Adam</hi> were seated at first in the Southern
Hemisphere of the Earth, as the <hi>Theory</hi> holds, then
how could <hi>he,</hi> or any of his Off-spring, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
into this Northern one? there being such a
fiery Partition betwixt them. Yet we are told of
Providence's<note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 371.</note> 
                  <hi>transplanting</hi> Adam <hi>into this Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere,
after he had laid the Foundation of a World
in the other.</hi> But that <hi>Adam</hi> in any ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
way (and no extraordinary one is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned)
should cross <hi>a wall of fire</hi> or <hi>a Region of flame</hi>
(we know not how many hundred Miles broad)
<hi>which none could pass or subsist in, no more than in
a Furnace;</hi> may justly be concluded a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
And then equally impossible it was, that
this Hemisphere of ours, should ever be peopled
by <hi>Adam</hi> or his Progeny before the Flood.</p>
               <p>To say that GOD led <hi>Adam</hi> through this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean
fiery Zone <hi>(the</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Theor. <hi>pag.</hi> 233.</note>

as soon as he had sinned; and so very timely, that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102637:95"/>
it was not as yet grown hot and burning; might
be a useful suggestion in the case, were it not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
forestalled and quite shut out, by what was
said before; namely, That <hi>Adam</hi> was not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splanted
into <hi>this</hi> Hemisphere, till <hi>he had laid the
Foundation of a World in the other.</hi> Which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to have been done in <hi>Twenty Years</hi> time (as
it could not well be done in less) yet in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval,
the fire would have been so kindled in the
Torrid Zone, as to have made it too hot a Climate
for him to have gone through.</p>
               <p>If in this our Land we have no Rain for eight
or ten weeks together in a Summer, we see how
lamentably the Ground is scorched, and how the
surface of it is turned as it were into a meer Turf:
and yet all this while the Sun is not perpendicular
to us, by two or three thousand Miles. But how
inconceivably hot then must the middle circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the First Earth have been, supposing it
subject to his perpendicular Beams, not only for
ten weeks, but twenty years together: and no one
Cloud to have overshadowed it, and no drop of
Rain to have fallen upon it, all that while?</p>
               <p>It is said to have been the Opinion of <hi>Athanasi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi>
and <hi>Ephrem Syrus,</hi> That Paradise, into which <hi>Adam</hi>
was put, lay beyond the Ocean: and that he
wading through it, made towards the Country
where he was formed; and at length dying there,
was buried in <hi>Mount Calvary.</hi> Upon what good
grounds this conceit was built, I know not: but
by no means can it escape the Censure of absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.
Yet the vast Ocean it self might as well be

of getting through that Ocean, was one
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102637:96"/>
thing that induced St. <hi>Austin</hi> to follow <hi>Lactantius,</hi>
and the Ancients generally, in denying <hi>Antipodes.</hi>
For in their Judgment an immense Ocean begirt
the Earth (after the manner this Zone is supposed
to have done) and parted our Northern from the

it to be his Judgment, That Mankind was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
there, and could not be transported from
hence, thither?</p>
               <p>5. Again, Had the Earth held such a <hi>Right Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi>
to the Sun; it would have put by the Rains,
which helpt to raise the Flood. I confess it is
granted, That at that time,<note n="*" place="margin">Theor. <hi>pag.</hi> 98.</note> 
                  <hi>the rains fell, forty
days and forty nights together, and that throughout
the face of the whole Earth.</hi> And this is but a
certain truth, and so a necessary concession. But
then it is more than the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> can bear; which
makes Rain impossible (while the first Earth stood)
in any other place but the Frigid Zones. And
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102637:96"/>
therefore to admit such <hi>general</hi> Rains, is to desert
or overthrow the <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> and to suppose the
Situation of the Earth changed, before it was so.</p>
               <p>So incompatible were Rains to the first order or
constitution of Nature, as fixed by the <hi>Theory;</hi>
that a Particular Hydrography was calculated by
it, to serve the prediluvian Age with Water. But
then the same System or Frame of Nature, which
rendred that World so impluvious all along, would
have done so at the time of the Flood likewise.
Yea, in that critical juncture, when Rains were
most useful; it would have taken most place, and
made them least plentiful. For then the Earth it
self would have been hottest and driest, and the
Subterraneous Abyss most exhausted.</p>
               <p>Nor can these general Rains be pretended
to come from the disruption of the Abyss;
as if the fall of the Earth had caused such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
commotions in the Air, or convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of its Regions, as made them every where to
pour down Waters. For<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> the <hi>Theory</hi> will have
the Rains to be antecedent to the disruption. <hi>I do
not suppose the Abyss broken open till after the forty
days rain.</hi> But then this is most directly against
Scripture again; for that plainly affirms the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
that the Fountains of the great Deep, and
the Windows of Heaven were both opened upon <hi>one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
day, <hi>Gen. 7. 11. In the six hundredth year of Noah's
life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the
month, the same day were all the fountains of the
great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were
opened.</hi> So that in the same year of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Life,
and in the same Month of that Year, and on the
same Day of that Month; the Fountains below,
and the Windows above, were both set open; that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102637:97"/>
the Waters issuing out of both might raise the
Deluge.</p>
               <p>6. Let me add, in the next place, That it is a
known Question, that has been moved by Writers
of all sorts, Ancient and Modern, <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
Divines, Historians, Chronologers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at
what time of the year the Flood came in. <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
(for instance) will have it to happen in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn;</hi>
others in the <hi>Spring;</hi> and they give their
reasons for it. The Question does manifestly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon inadvertency; their not minding that
when it was <hi>Spring</hi> in one part of the World, it
was <hi>Autumn</hi> in another. And the like Question
is put by Writers, and bandied among them, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Creation; at what time of the year that
great Work was done. But somewhat more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly,
there being no Seasons of the year, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Creation. Now this being the general
Judgment of the Learned; <hi>That the year had Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestival
Changes, from the beginning,</hi> even the same
that it has now (as these Questions import:) from
hence it may be inferted, that they never dreamt
of this Position of the Earth, or a Perpetual
Aequinox; but were all of the contrary perswasion,

               <p>Nor can it excuse the matter with this Pair of
Philosophers, to say that they were blinded here
with the common Error, and ran, for company,
with those that believed there was a Torrid Zone,
when there really was none. For allowing they
were so sagacious as to discover this Secret of the
Earth's <hi>Inclination;</hi> we must also grant that by the

discerned, that the effect thereof could not have
been, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The second <hi>Sentence</hi> is that of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> which

this happened by that means to the whole World.</hi>
Here is a mighty effect produced, without a cause as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed;
at least here is <hi>non causa, pro causa:</hi> the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
of a cause altogether incompetent and
not to be understood. For why should the Air
yield to the force of the Sun, more towards the
South, than towards the North, when his force
was equal upon both the Regions at once? For
he moving at all times exactly in the midst betwixt
them, his influence must be exactly alike upon each:
and therefore that it should cause the depression of
one more than of the other, is a thing in the dark and
unintelligible. But say the Sun had had power to
displace the Earth, and by sinking one Pole of it,
through such a <hi>cession</hi> of the Air, to have raised
the other: yet then that this cession should not be
in the Air, nor consequently this dislocation of the
Earth till the Flood happened; is not to be thought.
And therefore <hi>this</hi> Sentence favours not the <hi>Theory</hi>
neither; for <hi>that</hi> has positively determined the time

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102637:99"/>
the Southern Regions, because of the thinness or
openness of them; for while the Northern parts are
frozen with cold, the opposite are hot.</hi> To take off
this, we need but reflect on what has been said
already; for how could the Southern Pole of the
Earth dip into the Air, by reason the Air at that
Pole was <hi>hotter</hi> and more rarified, than it was at
the Northern Pole, when the Sun cut his way most
evenly betwixt both the Poles? Or if it could have
been so, yet then the Earth must have lost its
regular Position, and the Equinox have been turned
out of being, many hundreds of years before the
Deluge came; which is utterly inconsistent with the

                  <hi>The Southern part
of the ambient Air being the weaker,
the bulky Earth did therefore incline
that way. For the Northern Regions
being evenly, but the Southern unevenly
tempered; thence it was, that accordingly
it sagged down, where it abounded with
fruits and increase.</hi> Here is nothing
new, save this, That the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arth
abounding most with fruits towards
the South, the weight of those helped to bear it
downward; and so sway'd it out of its Aequinoctial
Site; which in truth is but a vain and unphiloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic
Phancy. For first, How could the Earth be
more fruitful at one Pole than at the other, when
the Soil was alike; and so, alike fertile; and both
the Poles were equidistant from the Sun? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
If the Earth had been most loaden with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Increments, about its South Pole; yet how
could these have overset or poized it down, by
making it the heavier? For they all proceeding out
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102637:99"/>
of the Bowels of the Earth; She must be as heavy
before they grew up, as after. Thirdly, If the
Earth could have been cast or settled towards the
South, by those fruits we speak of; yet still here
would be violence done to the <hi>Theory,</hi> by shutting
its continual praediluvian <hi>Aequinox</hi> quite out of
doors. For the Earth being most fruitful at first,
and consequently its Produ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> about the Southern
parts, most copious; That Pole, by their ponderous
burthen, must have been overpowered in the <hi>beginning,</hi>
and the Earth sunk into that inclining posture in
which now it stands.</p>
               <p>Having thus taken account of these Philosophers
Opinions, before we go farther, let us make a short
stop here; only so long as to remark these <hi>Four Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,</hi>
already hinted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That they of them who are most express for
the <hi>Inclination</hi> of the Earth, do not deny this <hi>Inclination</hi>
to have been from the <hi>beginning,</hi> or very soon after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they do not only not deny this,
but implicitly affirm it, by their assigning such causes
of it. For though they be improper and such as
never were; yet had they been, and could they have
produced the effect at all, they would certainly have
done it in the beginning of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That none of these Philosophers, do
make the least mention of a continual Aequin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x
antecedaneous to the Earth's <hi>Inclination.</hi> And in
case it should be urged, that their very asserting
the Earth to be inclined does suppose it was once
in such a Position, as was attended with a fixed
Aequinox. In way of answer it is observable,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That there is one Notion, which runs
through most of their Assertions, and sufficiently
proves, that they could never think the Earth held
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102637:100"/>
such a Position, as to be capable of a constant and
settled Aequinox. For they intimate that the Southern
Air was more <hi>thin,</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi> and <hi>yielding,</hi> than
the Northern; as being more <hi>temperate</hi> or <hi>warm</hi>
than that. But had they believed that the Earth
kept a <hi>Right Position</hi> to the Sun; and so had both
its Poles equidistant from him; they must withal
have believed the Air about both, to have been of
the like temperature and consistency.</p>
               <p>All which put together, makes it evident, That
the cited Testimonies are not <hi>satis illustria, clear
enough</hi> to do the <hi>Theory</hi>'s business: and that
the Article of the <hi>Right Situation</hi> of the Earth
(the cause of the supposed <hi>Aequinox</hi>) is not at
all established, <hi>Philosophorum Sententiis, by the sayings
of the</hi> aforesaid <hi>Philosophers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But therefore we have not done yet. <hi>Anaxago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
comes in with a second Attestation, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth,
<hi>That the Stars</hi>

So <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>genes Laertius</hi> delivers his mind. And this
may seem to be somewhat a better evidence for the
Earth's changing her Site. But in way of reply
it might be noted,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Ambrosius</hi> the Monk (a good Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lologer)
who translated <hi>Laertius</hi> into <hi>Latin;</hi> instead
of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, reads <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and so it signifies the Stars
to have moved unevenly from the beginning; that
is, as they do now. But let <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, be the true
lection. Yet then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Aldobrandinus</hi> renders that, <hi>turbulentè,
unsteddily.</hi> And so makes the Philosopher speak
the same sense that <hi>Ambrosius</hi> does, in a different word.
But we will go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arther still, and suppose,</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> meant, that the Stars
were carried about <hi>instar I holi, after the fashion of a</hi>
Cupulo (of which kind of Figure was the <hi>Pantheon</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore <hi>Dio</hi> calls that Temple
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Tholiform)</hi> yet then might he not mean
withal, that they imitated this Figure in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
only so far as the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Pole of the Earth,
by being near to a direct Situation under the Pole
of the <hi>World</hi> (not of the <hi>Ecliptic</hi>) would permit
it to be done: For the <hi>Declination</hi> he here speaks
of, we cannot understand so well with reference
to the Pole of the Ecliptic; because he calls it the
Pole <hi>simply,</hi> which denotes the Pole of the Aequator.
And about this Pole indeed several Stars or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations,
as the two <hi>Bears,</hi> the <hi>Dragon, Cepheus,
Cassiopoea,</hi> &amp;c. do move <hi>Tholiformly</hi> at all times: the
Pole still appearing about the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>top</hi> of the
Earth; that is to say, about the Pole of it. And
that these and other Stars thereabouts, <hi>had declined</hi>
since the <hi>beginning,</hi> he might well be of Opinion;
inasmuch as the <hi>Vertex, top,</hi> or Pole of the Earth,
might in his time have suffered a considerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination

passed into the <hi>Dodecatemorium</hi> or place of <hi>Taurus,</hi>
in the <hi>Zodiac:</hi> and <hi>Taurus</hi> into that of <hi>Gemini,</hi> and
so on. But then this is such a Declination, as does
not at all imply, that the <hi>axis</hi> of the Earth was ever in
a Parallelism with that of the Ecliptic; but only that it
was once in a <hi>nearer</hi> Parallelism to the <hi>axis</hi> of the
Aequator, than <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> found it in his days. And
so the <hi>Declination</hi> he meant, might be quite different
from that we contend about: which Astronomy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes

reason presently to run over to them, and to lay
the stress of our belief upon their Authorities: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when in so doing, we must walk contrary to
the whole World of the Learned at once. Yet so
it happens, that the most likely evidence which the
<hi>Theory</hi> brings in for the Earth's <hi>Declination,</hi> and so
for its <hi>Right Position,</hi> and <hi>Praediluvian Aequinox;</hi> is
borrowed of these two Men.</p>
               <p>8. Two Queries shall shut up this Chapter. The first
is this, Supposing an <hi>Aequinox</hi> in the beginning of the
World, <hi>would it (in likelihood) have continued till the
Flood?</hi> For truly even a little matter might alter it;
the condition of the primitive Earth considered. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
when it was newly formed, the upper Orb of it sat
as close to the Abyss as <hi>that</hi> did to the lower Orb. But
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102637:102"/>
in process of time, the Waters of the Abyss wereso ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted,
that betwixt the inside of this superiour Orb,
and the surface of those Waters, there was an huge ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;
the Orb we speak of, hanging hollow round the
Waters under it. But then it being so pendulous, and of
so oblong a Figure as is here<note n="*" place="margin">See the same Figure in the <hi>Latin Theory, pag.</hi> 46.</note> represented; methinks
<figure>
                     <p>Fig. 3 Page 186</p>
                  </figure>
it might easily have been inclined towards the North
or South (long before the Deluge) by some prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derancy
or over-poize, that might have happened at
either of its Poles, and determined it respectively. Thus
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102637:102"/>
(for instance) put case that the Waters which fell
in the frigid Regions had soaked into the Earth more
at one Pole than at the other; or had flowed less
freely (by reason of worse Chanels) from one Pole
than the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther; or that upon some account they had
been obstructed or dammed up by the bordering In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
at one Pole more than at the other; and
by their confined presence there, had made it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
heavier than the other: it being in a just
<hi>Aequilibrium</hi> before (and so easie to be sway'd)
must it not have sunk immediately at that Pole, so
overloaded; and receding from the level of its own
Orbit, have stood in a leering or wry Position to
the Sun? The Earth's own fruits was able thus to
settle or draw it down, according to <hi>Democritus.</hi>
And therefore it needs not seem strange that such
an excess of Water should do it; weigh it down
from a true libration, into an oblique or inclining
Position. Let us but remember what the great
Mathematician, upon no ill grounds, once declared;
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>give me but where I may set my foot,
and I'll remove the Earth;</hi> and what we have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
will not look like an improbable thing.</p>
               <p>The Second Query is this, Granting there was
such an <hi>Aequinox</hi> in the first World, <hi>would not
the natural day, towards the latter end of that World,
have been <hi>longer</hi> than in the former periods of the
same?</hi> For while the outward shell or sphere of
Earth, was contiguous with the Abyss; it seems
very likely that it was carried about with more cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
than it could be afterwards, when that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity
ceased, by reason the Waters of the Abyss
were exhaled. And in case that external <hi>Cortex,</hi>
the then habitable Earth, did abate of its diurnal
Motion, upon losing its contiguousness with the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102637:103"/>
Abyss it inclosed; and the wider the distance grew
betwixt them, the slower was its rotation; which
must follow, if the failure of the contiguity we
speak of did at first retard its gyration: then the
days just before the Flood, must of necessity be
longer than ever they were in the prediluvian World,
supposing Day and Night be made by the Earth's
turning upon its own <hi>axis.</hi> Especially if the Moon
came late into the Earth's Neighbourhood. For
then she being to be carried about in the exterior
part of the Earth's <hi>Vortex,</hi> would have slacked its
Motion; as an heavy Clogg hanged upon the Rim
of a Wheel, makes it turn more slowly. Yet that
the days just before the Flood were of no unusual
length, is evident in the very Story of the Flood;
the duration of which we find computed, by Months
consisting of <hi>Thirty</hi> Days apiece. Whereas had Days
been grown <hi>longer,</hi> fewer of them would have made
a Month.</p>

               <p>1. AMong the several Properties of the Predilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian

than its <hi>Oviformity.</hi> But as needful as it was, it
seems a thing improbable. The necessity of it, is
apparent from its Usefulness: and that was as great
as can well be imagined: For it was to be as an
<hi>Aqueduct</hi> to the first World; or a general Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

the Laws of this <hi>New Hypothesis,</hi> the Earth would

miserably barren as any piece of Wilderness
the worst <hi>Arabia</hi> has. And yet if we attend to
the first Earth's Origination, how could it be of
an <hi>Oval</hi> Shape?</p>
               <p>For a liquid Mass, having its Center in it self, and
being of a Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tance equally yielding in all its parts,

                  </gap>erence; that is, it must be
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102637:104"/>
exactly round or spherical. For why any piece
thereof should thrust up higher, or shoot out far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the common Center, than the rest; there
can be no reason given; Unless, according to the
<hi>Hylozoic</hi> Philosophy, we should suppose there is
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a principle of Life or <hi>self-movency</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
which indeed is to exalt it above its capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and to give it a property that destroys its
nature.</p>
               <p>And were not these the very circumstances of
that Mass, whereon the Primitive Earth was
founded? For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It was <hi>self-centred;</hi> and by vertue of its
proper Centre, so entirely coherent and united,
that no parts of it had the least tendency towards
jetting out, or flying off from the whole: but by
the Laws of gravity, were all impregnated with the
contrary determination, a nitency inward or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
towards the Central Point. And then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was <hi>Liquid</hi> also; and so of a yielding
temper or consistency. Ready to give way to the
lightest pressures, and by a forward pliantness, to
fall into that Figure, into which the circum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>luent
Air would fashion it. For that Element alone (or
a thinner than that) but by moving and gently
gliding upon it, might easily smooth it into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
evenness; provided it did but encompass it
around, and so was capable of slicking it by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
levigation. And therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It swam in such a fluid Element, as
did <hi>so</hi> environ it, grasping it on all sides with
a soft compression. So that during its fluitation
in that surrounding and gently constringent <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
it could not but be of a truly <hi>Globular</hi> Form.
Which admitted; the Primitive Earth must needs

be so too, and not <hi>Oval;</hi> as being cast upon this

               <p>
                  <hi>But to this it is opposed, That the Liquid Mass

stretch themselves out long-ways.</p>
               <p>In answer to which, let it be confessed, That
the Liquid Mass, on which the Earth was raised,
was rolled about; and that very swiftly upon its
own Centre. Yet that by vertue of its gyration
it should be shaped into an Oval fashion; was not
at all necessary; nor will the Instances brought in,
prove it was so, there being no parity or just pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
betwixt the several Cases. For, for Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be forced an end by the external violence
of Winds (where the impression propelling them
is <hi>superficial,</hi> and their motion <hi>progressive;</hi>) is a
different thing from their circumrotation in one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<hi>Moles;</hi> where they turn only with a natural
and most even Course, carrying the ambient body
(whereby they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102637:105"/>
their Figure) round along with them. For thus
we see, that notwithstanding the Earth turns so
swiftly, that every point in its circumference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Aequator, moves at the rate of fifteen De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
(nine hundred Miles) an hour; yet the
finest Sand upon the surface of the Earth, or the
lightest Dust upon the tops of the Mountains, is
never dissipated or disturbed in the least, by this
whisking circumvolution. Whence we may gather
(the case being much the same) that the whirling
Globe of Water, was so far from a necessity of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
oblong, by its rotation; that that very thing might
contribute to preserving it in a Globular For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Nor is the reason of this
Figure obscure, in a Globe of Water which is moved
circularly; for the Mass of Water being much more agitated
under the Aequator, than the Waters towards the Poles,
where it passed through lesser circles; those parts which
were most moved endeavouring to recede from the
Centre of their motion, when they could not quite
spring up and fly away, because of the Air which lay
upon them on every side, nor yet could fall back again
as being checked and resisted by that Air: they were
unable so free themselves any other way than by flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down to the sides: for Waters being pent, do
flow that way where they find easiest passage; and from
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102637:105"/>
that flowing down of the Waters to the sides, and
disburthening of the middle parts about the Aequator,
the Globe of Water might become somewhat oblong.</hi>
So that the Cause of the Oval Figure, in the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic</hi>
Waters, seems (in short) to be this. Their
discharging themselves, <hi>defluendo ad latera, by flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down to the sides</hi> or Poles of the Globe; upon
their swelling or rising up (by means of their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
circular motion) about the Aequator. But
granting the Waters did swell and rise thereabouts
(which yet would admit of dispute;) against this
piece of the <hi>Theory</hi>'s <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> it may be thus
excepted; Either the Waters did flow down to the
sides or Poles of the Globe, till it became Oval;
or they did not. If they did not flow down so
long, the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> fails, and the watry Mass
could never be Oval. If they did flow down so
long, then they must flow down, till they flowed
<hi>down, upwards.</hi> (Pardon the absurdity of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
the absurdity of the thing occasions it.)
For the Polar parts of the watry Mass, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Oval, were the highest, being most distant
from the Centre. And yet from the Aequator they
did <hi>defluere ad latera, flow <hi>down</hi> to the Sides</hi> or
Poles. Which that they might do, it was absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary that the parts about the Aequator should
be <hi>highest:</hi> else the Waters in flowing to the Poles,
would have been so far from flowing <hi>down,</hi> that
contrary to their natures, they must have risen up
above their Source. And yet as absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
again it was, that the Polar parts should be
<hi>highest</hi> at last; otherwise the watry Mass could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have been made of an Oval Figure. And yet
if it were made into that Figure, by the Waters
flowing <hi>down</hi> (as the <hi>Theory</hi> says) from about the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102637:106"/>
Aequator, to the sides, or Polar parts; then a <hi>third</hi>
thing will be as necessary as either of the <hi>two</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
namely, That the Waters (as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
should flow <hi>down, upwards.</hi> So that it is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
that the Mass of Waters was ever of an
<hi>Oval Form;</hi> as it is unlikely that a Contradiction
should be true; or that the Element of Water
should, <hi>of it self,</hi> perform a motion, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
its power, by being above or against its
nature. I say, <hi>of it self;</hi> for however there might
be violence (that of the circular motion) in making
it to swell about the Aequator; yet when once it
was risen there, it was left to it self, as I may say;
all farther force was taken off it, and it might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the duct of its own Principles of <hi>Gravity</hi> and
<hi>Fluidity.</hi> And accordingly it is said by the <hi>Theory,
se liberare, to free it self</hi> (from that force which it
suffered in receding from its Center, or rising up
under the Aequator) <hi>defluendo, by falling off</hi> or <hi>flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down;</hi> a proper expression of the true <hi>natural</hi>
motion of Water. But then if the place it fell or
flowed <hi>to,</hi> was higher than that it fell or flowed
<hi>from</hi> (as in this case it must prove, before the
watry Globe, by <hi>Defluxion</hi> of its Water, could be
made <hi>Oval)</hi> it is evident that the Water by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
motion, or <hi>of it self,</hi> did perform a course
against its nature. For when it <hi>flowed down</hi> (or
is said to do so) and according to its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ought to have done so; in reality, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the reason of the thing, it <hi>flowed up.</hi>
Nor indeed could it possibly do otherwise, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the great effect pretended; unless it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for an Oval body to be highest in its <hi>middle</hi>
parts. And then truly (but upon no other terms)
the watry Globe <hi>might become oblong, ex illo defluxu
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102637:106"/>
aquarum ad latera, &amp; exoneratione partium media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;
from that flowing down of the Waters to the
sides</hi> (which the <hi>Theory</hi> mentions) <hi>and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthening
of the middle parts</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Now if the watry Mass, upon which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
<hi>Theorist</hi> founds the first Earth; could not
be made <hi>Oval,</hi> in the way he has invented: then
neither could that Earth be of an <hi>Oval Figure,</hi> it
being bound to put on the same shape which the
Water had.</p>
               <p>2. Very improbable it is also that the first Earth
should be Oval, considering its Position or Direction
in its Annual Motion. For that was such as could
not well consist with its Oval Figure. In it, its
Poles are said to have pointed always to the Poles
of the Ecliptic: and so it would have been directed
not unlike to Ships swimming side-ways. Now
put a Ship, which is an Oval body, into the
smoothest stream imaginable, and lay it cross that
stream; and see how long it will keep in that Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Will it always hold it? No, nor for any
considerable while: but by degrees will quickly
wind and fall in to swim long-ways with it;
and continue mostly in that posture, as suiting best
with its own shape and the course of the Waters.
And truly that an Oviform Earth should lie cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Sun for Sixteen hundred years together; and
not change its site in compliance with the tendency
or stream of it; seems very strange, if not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
Especially when that Earth was thin compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively,
and hollow like a Shell; and so more light,
and ready to verge or be drawn aside from its supposed
primitive situation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:102637:107"/>The Present Earth, though generally allowed to
be of a spherical Figure; and also of a solid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
throughout (unless at its Centre;) and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
(according to the <hi>French</hi> Philosophy) to be
held by a particular hand of Nature, in its incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
posture (which must be more easie to be kept
by a <hi>round Earth,</hi> in the <hi>Medium</hi> which carries it;
than a <hi>Right Position,</hi> by an <hi>oblong</hi> one:) is yet
subject to wallowings in its Annual Motion. And
how then can it be thought, that the First Earth,
which was oblong, and had not that hand to hold
it steady; could preserve its <hi>axis</hi> in a constant pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelism
to the <hi>axis</hi> of the Ecliptic, till the time
of the Flood? It would rather have turned end-ways
in the Celestial Stream, and have stood for the most
part in that direction; as best agreeing with its own
Form, and the vehicular Current wherein it floated.
And so (its axis, by force of the aethereal matter,
being wrought into a coincidence with the Plain of
the Ecliptic; and the Ecliptic like a Colure, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
through its Poles) while its Poles would have
lookt East and West, and its Diurnal revolutions
have gone North and South: it would have brought
such a confusion into the Heavens and Earth at once,
as is not easie to be expressed.</p>
               <p>3. And that the First Earth was not Oval, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
may, in some measure, be gathered from the
Roundness or Sphericalness of the Present Earth.
For this Terraqueous Body on which we dwell, is
of a Spherical Fashion. So <hi>Anaximander</hi> thought,
and also <hi>Pythagoras, Parmenides,</hi> and others of old,
as well as all of later days. And as much is fairly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrible

                  <hi>Zeno</hi> (almost Two thousand Years since) noted
the Shadow of the Earth to be of. And a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Argument for the Proof of it, is fetcht from
the Moon. For in whatever place she has at any
time entered into an Eclipse, or emerged out of
the same; and whatever part of the Earth, during
any of her Eclipses, has been turned to her, still it
has been observed, that the Shadow cast by the Earth
upon her <hi>Discus,</hi> was always Circular; which argues
the Earth it self to be Globular. And that it is so,
may be inferred,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the Place of the Waters. For
were it Oval, they would not fail to retire out of
the Seas near the Poles; and running down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Aequator of the Earth (which would
be the lowest part of it) settle themselves around
it, in the middle Regions thereof. But instead of
this, we see the Waters are so far from drawing
off from the Northern Seas about the Pole, that they
abound most, and are deepest there; nor do we
know of any thing but vast and deep Waters about
the South-Pole neither. Whereas, I say, were the
Earth <hi>Oval,</hi> and so the Poles of it highest, the
Waters must necessarily have settled about the
midst of the Earth, there being the lowest place,
and so the properest for their Situation. And so
the Sea in Figure would have resembled an Hoop;
or as a liquid Zone would have encompassed
the Earth, and divided it into two Hemispheres,
in the same manner that some worthy Ancients
conceived it did; for want of better Skill in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:102637:108"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Earth were Oval, Navigation
towards the Poles, beyond such a Latitude as
bounds the Sphericity of the Earth, would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
difficult, if not impossible. For then in such
a course, Ships must steer up hill, and climb, as it
were, all the way they swim, as sailing in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ascent. But where would be Winds strong
enough to heave them up such watry steepness?
Or in case they had sufficient strength to do it;
yet would not the Vessels rather pitch into, and
run under the Waters that bear against them, than
drive up upon their rising surface? And let but the
blustring Gales which push them upward, cease;
and would they not forthwith stop? Yea, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
tack about, and (being left to themselves)
settle down towards the Aequator again. But we
hearing of no such difficult sailing up the Polar
Seas; nor such retiring of Ships down to the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
ones; have still more reason to believe, that
the Earth and Water make a True Globe. And
grant that these Arguments will not perfectly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate</hi>
the Earth to be Spherical; yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of more force to prove it is so, than any ever
brought to prove it otherwise; we have reason to
acquiesce in the received Opinion.</p>
               <p>4. But to this it may be answered: In case the
Earth be Round or Spherical <hi>now,</hi> this is no good
evidence that it was so at <hi>first.</hi> It might <hi>then</hi> be
Oval or <hi>oblong,</hi> and its present Roundness may be
owing to its Disruption. I reply; Admit the Earth
was oblong before the Disruption, and the falling
in of its outward Orb, could hardly reduce it into
a Spherical Form; but would rather have made it
<hi>more oblong</hi> still. For the Orb we speak of must
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102637:108"/>
(in likelihood) break and fall in first, about the
Aequator, or Middle parts of it. For there it was
most heated; and there it was most cracked; and
there it was most hollow underneath; the Waters
of the Abyss being much exhaled. And these parts
falling, those whereabouts the <hi>Tropics</hi> are now,
might fall soon after them. Whereas the Poles of
this Orb, being turned with a shorter or narrower
Arch, were much the stronger. And then being
remote from the Sun, and continually wet, were
not disposed to break at all, through driness and
brittleness, as the Regions about the Aequator were.
So that the Poles might remain whole, and keep
those very places almost which they held before.
For as for their sinking lower, and coming much
nearer together, than they were, it was not likely;
because that huge Circle of Ground, which fell in
about the Aequator and Tropics, would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted
and hindred them. For though the Poles
were hollow, they could not slip over the Earth
which fell in betwixt them, and clasp it in their
cavities; in regard they were not wide enough. For
the Orb being Oval, was narrowest towards the
Poles. So that the falling in of the Earth, must
have rendred it rather <hi>more,</hi> than less Oval; While the
Poles of it would have continued at their usual
distance almost, and the intermediate Regions, by
dropping into the Abyss, would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
into streighter Dimensions of Circumference.</p>
               <p>5. Or say the Disruption of the Earth, would
not have made it <hi>more</hi> Oval than it was; yet surely
it would not have made it <hi>less.</hi> For as the Earth,
in all probability, would have broke in first about
the Aequator (for the reasons alledged) so those
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102637:109"/>
Fragments being nearer the inward Earth, than
the Polar parts; would sooner have reached it in
their fall, than these could have done. Especially
considering these Polar parts (according to what was
said before) must have fallen entire in two vast
Caps as it were. For so they would have contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such abundance of Air, as must have rendred
their descent very slow; much slower than that of
the Aequinoctial, and Tropical Fragments. Which
being of quite another fashion, that did not inclose
the Air so much, would have descended a great
deal faster. Insomuch that before the Polar He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mispheres
(let me call them) could have got
down to the interiour Earth; all the ground that
fell in about the Aequator and Tropics, would have
been settled there, and fit to receive those mighty
Hemispheres, when they should have come and
whelmed themselves <hi>whole</hi> upon it. Or grant they
should have <hi>broke,</hi> by pitching upon that vast heap
of Earth, which fell down betwixt them; yet there
they must have laid in a confused posture where they
flew in pieces, and so would have helped to make the
Earth oblong. In a word, suppose they did sink
down as far proportionably towards the common
Centre, as the Aequinoctial and Tropical parts did; yet
if they sank no farther (as indeed why should they,
all circumstances considered?) the Earth in case it
were Oval at first, must of necessity continue so.</p>

not so well. For <hi>Ephraim</hi> and half the Tribe of
<hi>Manasseh, Ioseph</hi>'s Posterity (mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 17.)
in whose Land the Blessings of these Mountains
are here prophesied of by <hi>Moses,</hi> were planted in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:102637:110"/>
that Division of <hi>Palestine</hi> called <hi>Samaria:</hi> which
being on this side of <hi>Iordan,</hi> and upon the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi>
Sea, lay towards the <hi>West;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
its Mountains could not be called <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

                  </hi> And as for the other Half of
<hi>Manasseh,</hi> though they were seated beyond <hi>Iordan;</hi>
yet I do not find that the Mountains in their
allotment, were known by the name of <hi>Mountains
in the East.</hi> Or if <hi>Basan,</hi> and some of the Hills
of <hi>Gilead,</hi> belonging to this half Tribe, might be
so denominated: yet the whole Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
and the other half of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> had nothing to do
with them; and so <hi>they</hi> could not <hi>so well</hi> be the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
here pointed at in the Prediction. Inasmuch as
they were possessed but by the smaller part of <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s
Off-spring; whereas in reason the Prophecy should
respect the <hi>Major</hi> part of his Seed, and so refer to
those Mountains on the West side of <hi>Palestine,</hi>
where the whole Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and the other
half of <hi>Manasseh</hi> were settled. And therefore when

                  </gap>, <hi>ancient;</hi> they give it its most
proper Signification in this place, and such as makes
the best or truest sense. For the Mountains of
<hi>Gilead,</hi> and <hi>Basan,</hi> as well as <hi>Mount Ephraim</hi> (a ridge
of Hills crossing the Country of that Tribe; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts whereof were <hi>Gerizzim,</hi> and <hi>Ebal,</hi> and
the Hills <hi>Tsuphim;</hi> the Hill of <hi>Phineas,</hi> of <hi>Gaash,</hi>
of <hi>Salmon,</hi> and of <hi>Samron,</hi> whereon <hi>Samaria</hi> stood)
were all of them, though not <hi>Eastern,</hi> yet <hi>ancient</hi>
Mountains; such as might take their beginning
with the Earth it self, or immediately after. And
therefore the <hi>Septuagint</hi> calls the Mountains here,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Mountains of the beginning.</hi> And that
most fitly; for, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
<hi>from</hi> or <hi>before the beginnings of the Earth, Prov.</hi> 8.
23. And so the <hi>ancient Mountains</hi> in the Prophecy,
are such as were extant <hi>à primordiis seculi,</hi> from
the beginning of the World, in contradistinction to
such as were casually raised, or artificially
made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> also, in the same Chapter, speaks a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
word to our purpose. For declaring the
Antiquity, or Eternity of THE DIVINE
WISDOM; he there sets it out, by its existing
<hi>before GOD's Works of old, ver.</hi> 22. and then
particularly, <hi>before the Mountains were settled, ver.</hi> 25.
A most clear evidence, that the settling of the
Mountains, was one of the earliest Works that
ever GOD did. Else it could not have been suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to sort it with those that are there recounted,
nor would it have been proper to shew forth the
Antiquity of WISDOM by it; and to argue
that it was in GOD's Possession, <hi>in the beginning
of his ways,</hi> because it was so, <hi>before the Mountains
were settled.</hi> For if the Mountains were settled long
after those other <hi>works of old,</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
as long after, as the general Flood was after the
Creation; why should he place <hi>this</hi> work amongst
them, and rank it with them, as one effected at the
same time? And if they were settled, at the time
of the Deluge, how could WISDOM's existing
before they were settled, be a Proof or Illustration
of its being possessed by the LORD <hi>in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his ways?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that if we can but think, that Scripture is
to be understood like other writings; that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the common signification of its words,
and the manifest drift or scope of its sense: And
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:102637:111"/>
if we can but believe, that when GOD speaks
with design to instruct us; He does it with the
same freeness and sincerity, as a rational and honest
Man, as a kind and open hearted friend would do,
that means to discover his mind unto us; we need
not desire more pregnant Proofs of the Mountains
just coaevity with the Earth.</p>
               <p>2. The same Scriptures that prove Mountains
coaeval with the Earth, are clear Evidences that
they could not arise from the Disruption of the
same. Which Opinion being so fairly encountred
and overthrown by <hi>Divine</hi> Authorities; to pursue
it farther may seem unnecessary. But yet that
<hi>Nature</hi> may set its hand to the confutation of it,
as well as <hi>Scripture;</hi> I will here put down One
single Argument which the Moon affords us.</p>
               <p>That she hath her Mountains as well as the Earth, is
very evident. And also that they are <hi>higher</hi> than
the Earth's Mountains: I mean not only compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
in proportion to her Bigness; but they are
so, simply and absolutely in themselves, if w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
credit <hi>Galileo.</hi> Yea, they are not only higher
than the Mountains of the Earth, but better than
<hi>four times</hi> as high, as he undertakes to<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Astronom. Nun. pag.</hi> 24, 25, 26.</note> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
Whence it must follow, either that the
Moon was not formed and dissolved, the same way
that the Earth was<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. Lat. Theor. pag.</hi> 58. and also the <hi>English</hi> one, p. 110, 168, 170.</note>; both which the <hi>Theorist</hi> owns
her to have been; or else that her Abyss was
deeper, and her outward Orb thicker by far, than
was the Earth's (to make such prodigiously lofty
Hills) and so that she was very much <hi>larger</hi> than
the Earth: the contrary to which is most true and
manifest. Or, lastly, (which is the case) that her
Mountains were not the effects of her Dissolution
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:102637:112"/>
(which she never suffered;) but her <hi>Native Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
and such as she has worn ever since her
Creation. But then why should it not be so with
the Earth likewise? Or how can it be otherwise?
For were it granted, That the Mountains of both
did at first arise (as the <hi>Theory</hi> would have them)
from the falling in of their respective exterior Orbs;
it would be hard to assign reasons, why Mountains
in the Moon, should be <hi>four times</hi> higher than
any on the Earth; when the Globe of the Earth,
is above <hi>forty times</hi> bigger than that of the
Moon.</p>
               <p>3. And that Mountains were in being before the
Flood, and so could not result from the <hi>falling in</hi>
of the Earth; we may learn, in some measure,
from the <hi>Talmudists,</hi> even while they teach what
is phanciful and extravagant. For they report,
That many Giants saved themselves from the Flood
upon <hi>Mount Sion.</hi> And <hi>Iosephus</hi> intimates such
another Tradition out of <hi>Nicolaus Damascenus:</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Antiq. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 4.</note>

                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>to
which many flying in the time of the Flood, are said
to have escaped.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>First</hi> of these Reports, it is wholly
fabulous; nor can it be otherwise as being repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Scripture and Reason. The <hi>other,</hi> though
certainly false in the gross, may yet have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of truth in it, as being a broken account of
the Preservation of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, and the
Story of their Deliverance mangled and disguised.
For it being commonly believed, that the Ark
rested upon the Mountains of <hi>Armenia;</hi> and that
the Old World being Drowned, the New one was
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:102637:112"/>
Peopled by Men <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as <hi>Lucian</hi>'s word is)
<hi>of a second stock,</hi> that came down from thence:
this might give occasion to that formal fiction of a
Multitude flying to <hi>Baris,</hi> and of their being saved
there.</p>
               <p>Now though one of these Traditions be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
false, and the other a Truth perverted and
misrepresented; yet such things being talkt of in
times of old, and at last put in writing, they do
fairly witness what the Thoughts of Men were
in former Ages, as to this matter; and that it was
a current perswasion among them (who lived much
nearer to the first World) that there were Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
before the Deluge.</p>
               <p>And such another piece of confused Forgery

when the GODS drown the Earth,

Mountains; while they that are with
us in Cities, are carried by Torrents
into the Sea.</hi> And that this was a Fragment or
lame kind of Excerption out of the Holy Oracles;
the Father himself signifies. For he presently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites
the <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophers of Pilfering, and draws
up this smart Charge against them; That they
were a Pack of <hi>ingrateful Thieves, who filched,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the <hi>chief</hi> of their Opinions
from</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets.</hi> And if this Flood had
not been greatly mistaken as to time, and so the
Story of it set with its face the wrong way, it
would have looked directly upon what we are
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102637:113"/>
asserting, and given countenance to it. For then
the Flood here mentioned, must have been that of
<hi>Noah;</hi> and the Mountains of refuge for the Herd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Shepherds, must have been extant in the First
World.</p>
               <p>It is well known also, that many of the Learned
Ancients have taught, that Paradise was situate
upon high Mountains. And according to that
Doctrine, there must be Mountains at the very first.
And however some eminent Writers are of Opinion,
That the Mountains were neither so <hi>many</hi> nor
<hi>great</hi> before, as since the Deluge; yet none, I think,
ever excluded them wholly, till then. And I durst
appeal to the <hi>Theorist</hi> himself, if ever he met with
any, that held the Earth was without an <hi>open Sea.</hi>
Yet as many as suppose such a Sea in Nature, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Mountains too; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tis necessary they should
as himself confesseth. The Consequence of which
will be, That no Authority is to be brought, or
heard, against the being of Mountains before the
Flood; but such as is express against open Seas.
And then I presume we may search long enough,
before we find one.</p>
               <p>I will only add that Traditional Story which is
told of <hi>Adam;</hi> namely, how that after his Fall,
and when he repented of his sin, he bewailed it
for several hundreds of Years, upon the Mountains
of <hi>India.</hi> Another plain intimation that there were
Mountains in the beginning of the World.</p>
               <p>4. Nor is it hard to conceive how they should be
made then, as well in-land ones, as others. And
that in such a way (to humour Philosophy) as
Nature might have a considerable stroke in the
Work. For though it be not for us exactly to understand
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102637:113"/>
the manner of GOD's Proceedings in this Case
(whose ways in forming the Mountains, as well
as in other things, <hi>are past finding out;</hi> and for
Men to offer at a clear and certain Explication of
their Rise, would be arrogant presumption; as if
the Nut-shell of their Phancy, could contain the
Ocean of the Divine Methods) yet with humblest
Adoration of the ALMIGHTY's Infinite Power
and Wisdom, and acknowledgment that he <hi>could,</hi>
and 'tis like, <hi>did</hi> produce them another way; I will
venture to guess he might do it thus. But I only
hint, what it would require a large Discourse, to
make out and confirm in every Particular.</p>
               <p>The Earth, when it was first created, lay under
Water (as the infallible Word informs us) till the
Third Day; and on that Day, the Waters were
gathered into one place. The <hi>Alveus,</hi> that is, or
<hi>Hollow</hi> of the Sea being prepared, by GOD's pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
down the Ground (suppose) lower there, than
it was in other places; the Waters fell violently
into that Cavity. And as they were carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a Natural Course, while by the force of
their Weight they rolled downward: so they were
help'd by a Power supernatural; 'tis like by the
Influence of that Blessed SPIRIT, who moved
upon them when they were first brought forth.
Otherwise perhaps they could not have been so
drained off the Earth in one Day, as that the dry
Land should have appeared. Now the Earth, by
this Collection of the Waters into one place, being
freed from the load and pressure of them, and laid
open to the Sun; the Moisture within it, by the
heat of his Beams, might quickly be turned into
Vapours. And these Vapours being still increased
by the continued rarefying warmth from above;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102637:114"/>
at length they wanted space wherein to expand or
dilate themselves. And at last not enduring the
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inements they felt, by degrees heaved up the
Earth above; somewhat after the manner that
Leaven does Dough, when it is laid by a Fire;
but much more forcibly and unevenly. And lifting
it up thus in numberless places, and in several Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities,
and into various Figures; Mountains were
made of all shapes and sizes.</p>
               <p>Thus we may conceive the <hi>In-land</hi> ones were
produced; which in some Countries were more,
and in some fewer; in some bigger, and in some
lesser; in some higher, and in some lower; in
some again earlier, and in some later: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the Nature of the Soil, the Vapours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, and the Sun above it, contributed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
to the raising of them. And how a Ridge
or Chain of Hills might be blown up at once, as
well as one single one; how Mountains should be
hollow at the Roots, and in their higher parts, and
full of Caverns; how in time they might be dried,
hardened, and turned into Stone in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
how some of them, through their weight and
hollowness, might break and fall; and in their
hideous Fragments and disorderly Postures, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the ruines of an Earth sunk into an Abyss:
and others might be eaten and worn away by
Time and Weather, especially by that Weather in
time of the Flood; and so become rough and craggy,
and surprizingly horrid and frightful things will
be obvious, or at least intelligible, to thinking and
Philosophic Minds.</p>
               <p>And that Mountains might be brought forth thus
at first, or raised in the way we speak of, will seem
more likely still, in case we consider how Hills often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102637:114"/>
have been thrown up by Earthquakes: where
though the Causes were not the same, they were
very like them, or analogous to them. The Earth
also at first, was most disposed or liable to these
Effects; I mean, to have Mountains made out of
it. For then the Soil (being destin'd and prepar'd
to be the common <hi>Seminium, Seed-plat</hi> and <hi>Nursery</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f all sorts of Vegetables, and of some living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
was soft, and light, and unctuous; and so of
a very yielding Nature. The Pores of it also were
then close shut up, as having never been opened by
Sun or Winds. By which means the Vapours im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
in it having no manner of vent; when
they became strong enough (by their daily increase)
might easily cast up huge quantities of Ground
thereby to free themselves, and get loose from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them.</p>
               <p>Nor need we wonder, that sometimes a Valley
betwixt two Hills, should be lower than the common
surface of the Earth. For the matter of those Hills
being spewed up from under that Tract between
them; the ground must there sink down in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill up the emptied space beneath, and so
fall lower down than the rest of the Earth. And
for the same reason, or others like it, many places
in the Sea may be exceeding deep, and seem to go
down into a perfect Abyss as it were, or a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
profundity.</p>
               <p>And we must note, that though but only part
of the Earth be Mountainous, yet little or none of
it is exactly level; as being every where heaved up
by the forementioned Causes, more or less. And
therefore the smoothest Plains, that appear to the
eye to be very even, are not really so. Only this
we may observe, concerning them, That when
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102637:115"/>
Horse-men travel over them, the Ground being
struck with the Feet of the Beasts, yields a kind
of Sound. Which shews that the Earth in those
Plains, is much in that Posture, into which the Sun
and Vapours did at first raise it; loose, that is, and
porous, and somewhat hollow. Whereas amongst
Hills and Dales it yields no such noise, when beaten
with such Tramplings. And the reason is clear,
because it being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lung up, and fallen down, and
altered and transposed by eructations and sinkings;
it has so been driven closer and made more
compact.</p>
               <p>And then as to <hi>Maritime</hi> Hills, or those near the
Sea, when the Ground was crushed down by the
hand of OMNIPOTENCE, to make a
Receptacle for the Water; it is easie to conceive
how they should fly up at the sides of Seas, or
not far from them. As also how Hills should be
highest in those Countries, about which Seas are
deepest. For the Ground in the adjacent, or not
far distant Seas, being sunk very low, and forced
to give way very much; it might well crowd out
and thrust up a great height, about the Shores, or
in the adjoyning Regions. Nor is it to be thought,
that when so great a part of the surface of the
Earth was pressed down, that the Ground should
struggle out at the Brinks of the Ocean only, and
in some considerable distance from the Shores:
much of it would recoil from under the compres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Sea it self, and fly up irregularly in
innumerable places, where it could best do it. And
hence might come Banks in the Sea stretcht out
(as Mountains are on the Land) to extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
lengths. As also Rocks, and Flats, and Shelves
without number.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:102637:115"/>Nor must this be omitted, That all the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Earth, if raised according to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
will have no reason to hold proportion in
bulk to the Cavity of the Ocean. A thing which
the common <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of their Formation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys,
and which lies as a main Objection against
it. For thus the In-land Mountains would not be
made out of the Sea at all. Nor would the whole
quantity of Earth, which at first filled up the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the Sea, be cast out into the Maritime
Hills; but most of it be squeezed and forced down
deeper into the bowels of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Thus also <hi>Islands</hi> might be made (to take a
short step out of the way we are in;) I mean such
as are not of the largest size; whether they be
distant from all <hi>Continents,</hi> as the <hi>Canaries, Azores,
Hesperides,</hi> and others in the <hi>Atlantic</hi> Ocean; or
such as lie in whole Fries by the <hi>Main-lands</hi>-side,
as they do in several places of the World. Though
many of this latter sort, might be raised out of
Mud or Dirt, descending in great plenty out of
Rivers. So were the <hi>Echinades</hi> in the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea,
just before the mouth of the River <hi>Achelous.</hi> Or
else they might be made by the flowing of the
Waters into the Sea, when they were first
drawn off the surface of the Earth. For then they
running furiously down into the Pit, which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
had fitted and appointed for them, might wear
away the ground about the Verge thereof; and
eating into its <hi>Superficies</hi> by the violence of their
course, might divide it into a multitude of little
Apartments: which afterward when the Sea was
filled, might be petty <hi>Islands</hi> about its Coasts; as
the <hi>Philippines,</hi> for instance, and others in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental
Seas, which stand in whole Sholes, even
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102637:116"/>
thousands of them together against <hi>China</hi> and
<hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whirlepools also by the same means might be made
in the Sea (as well as chanels for Rivers underground by
land) for the Earth being pressed down deep in
some places, and thereby forced to ascend in others;
kind of arched Vaults might so be formed. Which
leading out of one Sea (or one part of a Sea) into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
the waters flowing through them, cause those
<hi>voragines,</hi> or Gulfs at the top where they enter their
subterraneous Pipes or Passages. Many of which
Gulfs are so strong, that they suck in and swallow
up whatever comes into them.</p>
               <p>But to return, we need no more wonder at the
<hi>Greatness</hi> or <hi>Number</hi> of Mountains made (in this
method) on the Earth; than at the Gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>losity or
ruggedness in the rind of an Orange. And as the
Mountains in truth bear no more proportion to the
Earth's Dimensions, than those little pimples do to
the fruit we speak of; so they and In-land Mountains
both, may proceed from Causes not <hi>altogether</hi> unlike.
Though now those Causes as to the Earth are so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated
and wasted, that they are unable to produce
the like Effects. Particularly that slatuous Moisture,
wherewith at first it did abound, and might be put
into it on purpose to make it heave in <hi>general</hi> into ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
inequalities; and in <hi>places</hi> to ascend into
mighty Hills; is spent and gone. And we have
no more reason to expect that the Earth should ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
send forth Mountains now; than that a dead
ripe Orange pluckt off the Tree, should break out
into such Wheals or Wens, as we see upon some.</p>

                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:102637:116"/>5. One argument for Mountains in the first World,

Assertion</hi> of it, that says, <hi>The Exterior face</hi> of
the first Earth, <hi>was smooth and uniform, without
Mountains;</hi> says also, it was <hi>without a Sea.</hi> All that
prodigious Mass of Waters, which Imagination (as
comprehensive as it is) knows not well how to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
was once shut up in an invisible Cell; and
being clapt under Hatches, lay <hi>incognito</hi> as long as
the first World stood. Not a Drop of it appeared
all that while, but what strained forth by evaporation;
or transpired through the Pores of the thick skin'd
Earth, when by the heat of the Sun it was put
into a sweat. As for the main Body of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
they lurked and hid themselves in a secret

in upon them, and justled them out of their Mansions, to
make room for it self.</p>
               <p>But against this, there lies the usual Exception;
namely, That it fights with the Holy Scripture.
For <hi>that</hi> informs us, That when GOD made <hi>Adam,</hi>
he gave him <hi>Dominion over the fish of the Sea.</hi> But
according to this <hi>Assertion</hi> of the <hi>Theory, Adam</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

saw the <hi>Sea,</hi> nor <hi>one Fish</hi> in it, all his life
long, though it lasted well nigh a thousand Years:
and so, impossible it was, that he should have or
exercise such a Dominion.</p>
               <p>And it is farther considerable, That <hi>Adam</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over the Sea, was not only granted him by
Patent from Heaven: but moreover was part of
GOD's <hi>Image</hi> which was stamped on him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>insoever
the <hi>whole</hi> did consist, this, I say, seems to
have been <hi>part</hi> of the Impress. <hi>For GOD said,
Let us make Man in our Image, after our likeness,
and let him have dominion <hi>

sea,</hi> Gen.</hi> 1. 26. And so, to shut up the Sea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Earth till the Flood, is to deny to Men a
part of that Empire, wherewith their Maker was
pleased to invest them; and to deprive them of a
piece of his glorious Image which he put upon them.
For none could share fully in the one or the other;
but they who lived after the general Deluge.</p>
               <p>If it be said, That Men at length were made
Lords of the Seas (as soon, that is, as they were
open) and had power over the Fish therein; and
so the word spoken by their Creator, was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
verified; and the Prerogative promised, amply
conferred: I answer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Divine Word was never made good
to <hi>Adam,</hi> nor was that high Prerogative bestowed
on him. Yet he being the Head of Mankind, had
reason to be instated in all the Privileges of Humane
Nature, which GOD annexed to it, or settled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, as such.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Adam</hi>'s Off-spring (as many as lived and
died before the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Rule or Dominion over Seas and
Fish, intended for <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity; was
immediately conveyed to them. Even at the same
time that Dominion was given to them, over Fowle,
and Cattle, and Creeping things. And therefore
we find it transferred by the same Act, and in
the very same form of Donation. Only Dominion
over the Sea was <hi>First</hi> mentioned; which is no sign
that it was <hi>Last</hi> to be attained. The Royal Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by which they claim and hold the Prerogative,
testifies as much: it runs as followeth, <hi>And GOD
said, Let us make man in our image, after our
likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of
the Sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the
cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thing that creepeth upon the earth, Gen.</hi> 1. 26.
And again <hi>ver. 28. have dominion over the fish of
the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
living thing that moveth upon the earth.</hi> So that
admit nothing of GOD's Similitude imprinted upon
Man, did consist in this Dominion; yet let any
judge, whether GOD did not intend hereby to pass
unto Men, as full a Dominion over the <hi>Fish;</hi> as over
other Creatures. As also whether they were <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently</hi>
to have and exercise this Dominion; or to
be suspended from it for above sixteen hundred Years.
That they had Dominion over the Fowl, and over
the Cattle, and over the Creeping things; from the
beginning; I dare say the <hi>Theorist</hi> himself will not
deny. And how then can he bar them from it

the <hi>first</hi> thing in order in the Sacred Grant.

               <p>2. And that there should be <hi>open</hi> Seas even from
the Creation; seems very necessary upon the <hi>Fishes</hi>
account. For when GOD gave them the Blessing
of Multiplication (endued them, that is, with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite

And indeed some kind of Fishes there were, that could

Fishes were made, GOD created huge Whales
also; passing the same Benediction upon <hi>them,</hi> as
he did upon those. I confess, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </hi> said <hi>Iob.</hi> He put
them together, as having special Relation to one
another. And truly if in the beginning, there were
such monstrous Whales, there must be Seas answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to them. And that the Whales at first created,
were as large as any, we need not question. For
as it became the ALMIGHTY to send forth <hi>them</hi>
in their full perfection, as well as other Creatures:
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102637:121"/>
so to convince us that he did so, he bestowed the
Epithet, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, upon them, calling them, <hi>GREAT
Whales, Gen.</hi> 1. 21. So that could there have
been Rivers, or Lakes in the first Earth sutable to
<hi>other</hi> Fishes; yet these mighty ones would have
been too big for them.</p>
               <p>3. What remains therefore, but that the only place
of aboad which (according to this new <hi>Hypothesis</hi>)
can be allowed these Bulky Creatures (though it
does not allot it to them) must be the subterraneous
Abyss? And then the Waters in that Abyss (how
improperly soever) must be the <hi>Waters in the Seas,</hi>
wherein they were to live and multiply, according
to the Divine Blessing and appointment.</p>
               <p>But <hi>that</hi> Abyss (though of a meet capaciousness)
could by no means have been a fit Dwelling for them,
upon several accounts. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It would have been a place exceeding
<hi>Dark,</hi> full of perpetual and blackest Midnight.
Neither Sun, nor Moon, nor Stars, could ever have
lookt into it; or darted so much as one bright
Beam into the Pitchy Recesses of it. So that besides
the loss they would have been at for P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ey, how
could they have seen to direct their Motions? ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no manner of Light at any time to guide them?
So that upon occasion, they must have r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n at tilt
upon one another; and being inclosed between two
Earths, would have been in danger of stranding
themselves both above and below.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It would have been a place as <hi>close,</hi> as
it was dark. And therefore what shift should they
have made for Air? I think I may say for Breath.
For as for Whales and other Fishes that have Lungs;
<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Nat. Hist. l. 9. c.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> says, <hi>It is fully resolved by all Writers, that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102637:121"/>
they breathe.</hi> And his Opinion it is, That all Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-creatures
do the same, after their manner. In
proof of which, he offers several Arguments not to
be despised. As their <hi>Panting, Yawning, Hearing,
Smelling,</hi> &amp;c. To which add their <hi>Dying</hi> upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
frozen up for any time. Or if they be alive,
their greedy flying to any little hole made in the
Ice, whereat the Air enters. But in the Abyss
they could have had neither Air nor Breath; and
so for lack of the same, must all have been smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> It would have been a place as <hi>Cold,</hi> as
it was dark and close. For the same Cover of
Earth (of unknown thickness) that would have
hindred Light and Air from piercing into the Abyss;
must have kept out the Suns cherishing and benign
Warmth too. So that could they have struggled
with, and overcome the <hi>two first</hi> Inconveniences;
yet here they would have met with a <hi>Third,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable.
Could they have lived without Light
and Breath; yet they could not have multiplied
without the Influence of Heaven. The want of
that, would have chil'd and quench'd the desires of
Procreation in them, and rendered them impotent
that way. Thus, Winter, we see, is no season for
Production of Fishes; as being destitute of that
quickning power and encouragement, which the
Presence of the Sun affords.</p>
               <p>4. Farther yet. That there were Seas in the
Beginning, even on the <hi>Third</hi> Day; we are taught,
<hi>Gen. 1. 10. GOD called the dry land, Earth; and
the gathering together of the waters, called he, Seas.</hi>
And why should they not be such Seas as we have
now? For we have no more grounds to think or say,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:102637:122"/>
That the Waters there mentioned, were an invisible,
potential, or proleptic Sea; than we have to imagine
or affirm, that the dry Land there spoken of, was
an invisible, potential, or proleptic Earth.</p>
               <p>And that there were open Seas then, may be argued
from the Waters we read of <hi>under the firmament,
Gen. 1. 6, 7. And GOD said, Let there be a
firmament in the midst of the Waters, and let it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the waters from the waters. And GOD made
the firmament, and divided THE WATERS
WHICH WERE VNDER THE FIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAMENT,
from the waters which were above the
Firmament.</hi> But had there been none but River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters
in the first World, and not such an open
and huge Collection of Waters, as we now see:
the Firmament could not so properly have been said,
to <hi>divide the waters from the waters.</hi> For then it
must rather have been in the midst betwixt the
<hi>Earth</hi> and the Waters; and so must have divided
the <hi>Earth</hi> from the Waters; the <hi>Earth</hi> which was
under the Firmament, from the Waters above it.
For as for the River-waters, <hi>they</hi> would have been
too inconsiderable, to have had the Partition made
by the Firmament, predicated of them in exclusion
of the Earth, or in preference to it. It would
have been as if the KING should have said, Let
a Wall be built betwixt the <hi>Thames</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits
of <hi>London,</hi> to part them; without taking any
notice at all of the City, which is infinitely more
remarkable than the Conduits are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But therefore the</hi> Theory <hi>presents us with a</hi> new
<hi>Notion of the Firmament, and makes it to be quite
another thing, than what it has always been said to
be; namely, That</hi> Cortex <hi>or Outward Region of
Earth, spread and founded upon the Abyss. And
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:102637:122"/>
so the Waters of the Abyss under that Earth, must
be the Waters under the Firmament. I cite but
two Paragraphs to this purpose.</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Primo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitu facilè quis suspicari posset, hanc compagem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorem, quam Deus stabilivit super faciem Abyssi, intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligendam esse per illud Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamentum, quod Deus dicitur stabiliisse inter aquas inferiores &amp; superiores, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 6. &amp; 7. <hi>Theor. p.</hi> 124.</note> Any one at the

those below.</p>
               <p>But this truly is so far from giving any satisfaction,

                  <hi>Vnphilosophic</hi> thing. But I
forbear to retort. It is enough to shew that the
advantage lies so much on our side, and that the

               <p>And since to make the Earth before the Flood,
to be this Firmament, is so impossible; as being
manifestly repugnant to the Truth of GOD: what
remains but that it should be that diaphanous <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansum</hi>
stretched out betwixt us and the Clouds?
which as it is constituted of <hi>Air</hi> chiefly; so it is the
place wherein Fowls do fly, according as Providence
was pleased to appoint. And to seal up this for a
certain truth, it is known that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> have
no other word whereby to express, <hi>Air,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Firmament.</hi> Only whereas <hi>this
Aereous</hi> Expansion extends from hence to the cloudy
Regions (where are the Wates above the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and therefore are called<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 148. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Waters, above the

set them in the Firmament of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then this Aereous space we speak of, being
the <hi>true</hi> Firmament; this proves there were open
Seas at first. Else (as was said before) this Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
must have divided the Waters from the
<hi>Earth;</hi> whose surface (bating a few Rivulets)
would have been entire under it: but could not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
have divided the Waters above the Firmament,
from the Waters under it; because the Waters under the
Firmament would have been in no united Body, and
of no join'd or continuous <hi>Superficies;</hi> but (to grant
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:102637:123"/>
what the <hi>Theory</hi> supposeth) dispersed in Rivers
running on the Earth, which would have been one
huge unbroken Continent. Yea, and in a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Tract of Ground around this Earth, there
would not have been so much as one Rill of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
neither; even according to the <hi>Theory</hi> it self, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
its Hydrography.</p>
               <p>5. But here we meet with Opposition upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Accounts. As first, if Open Seas were the
Waters <hi>under</hi> the Firmament, in the primitive State
of things; then the <hi>Clouds</hi> must be the Waters <hi>above</hi>
the Firmament: But against this it is objected thus:
<note n="*" place="margin">Theor. <hi>pag.</hi> 234.</note> 
                  <hi>If nothing be understood by the Celestial Waters, or
Waters above the Firmament, but the Clouds and
the middle Region of the Air as it is at present:
methinks that was no such eminent and remarkable
thing, as to deserve a particular Commemoration by</hi>
Moses, <hi>in his six days work.</hi> To which I take leave
to answer, That the Clouds, how contemptible so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they may seem, are no whit unworthy to be
specified or remembred by that famous Writer in
his <hi>Cosmopoeia,</hi> or Story of the Worlds Creation.
And this will appear if we rightly consider but <hi>Two</hi>
things concerning them; Their <hi>Dimensions,</hi> and their
<hi>Vsefulness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Look to their <hi>Dimensions.</hi> Who can tell
what vast and mighty things they are? To what
length and breadth do they stretch out themselves?
and how do they cover whole Kingdoms at once
with their shady Canopies? And then they are of
answerable thickness too. So that interposing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Sun and us, they oftentimes turn day into
night almost, by intercepting his light. Which in
the Holy Philosophy, as an act of Providence, is
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:102637:124"/>
thus ascribed to GOD. <hi>With clouds he covereth the
light, and commandeth it by that which cometh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt,
Iob</hi> 36. 32. Sometimes they mount up and
fly aloft, as if they forgat or disdain'd the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Origin, and scorn'd to be thought of
earthly extraction. Sometimes again they sink and
stoop so low, as if they repented of their former
proud aspirings, and did remorseful humble Penance
for their high presumption. And though I may
not say they weep to expiate their arrogance, or
kiss the Earth with bedewed Cheeks in token of
their Penitence; yet they often prostrate in the Dust,
and sweep the very lowest grounds of all, with their
misty foggy trains. One while they are spread
thin and single over us; another while they are
doubled, trebled, and strangely pil'd up or whelm'd
one upon another: or else built with <hi>Stories</hi> as it
were, and made into several Concamerations. And
therefore they are said to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>His</hi> (that is
GOD's) <hi>Chambers, Psal. 104. 3, 13. Now,</hi> they
look like Ridges of Hills in our Horizon: <hi>anon,</hi>
like a Row or Chain of Rocks: and by and by
they hang like pendulous Mountains, or swim like
floating Islands in the Aiery Ocean. <hi>Here,</hi> they pour
down abundance of <hi>Rain;</hi> and <hi>there,</hi> as much <hi>Hail:</hi>
in one place, they scatter <hi>Sleet;</hi> in another, deep
<hi>Snow,</hi> and that for many hundreds of Leagues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
To say nothing of those glorious things
the <hi>Rain-bow, Parelia's, Paraselenes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thunder</hi>
also is from the Clouds. And yet it is a thing so
very considerable, that GOD himself calls it his
VOICE, in the <hi>Psalms;</hi> yea, his <hi>Mighty</hi> VOICE,
and also his <hi>Glorious</hi> or <hi>Majestic</hi> VOICE. So much
Power, and Glory, and Majesty is there in it, that
it strikes awe and terror into the hearts of the best,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102637:124"/>
as well as of the greatest. And certainly (the
righteous being bold as a Lion) it was a greater
sign of its Dreadfulness, that a good Man's Heart
should <hi>tremble and be moved out of its place,</hi> at this

so large, and never so thick; never so full, and
never so heavy; and (as one would think) should
load the Air with inconceivable gravitation: yet
they do not fall down and crush us to pieces, or
bury us alive under Mountains of Ice. No, they
bear up as lightly, and drive on as swiftly through
the yielding Sky, as if they had no kind of weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in them. And to whatsoever Philosophy may
impute this (as to their being always in Motion;
their being turgid with Vapours; to the thickcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
of the Air under them, or the like) the
thing is really and greatly to be wondered at. And

                  </hi> As they
contribute greatly to the Preservation of it; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
it in a good and verdant State. If the same
Great GOD whose Powerful Goodness brought the
World into being, and fixt it in a Regular and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Order; did not by a wise and gracious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutenency
(exerted chiefly in a well contrived Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
and Concatenation of things, linkt to one
another by a continued Chain of just Connexion and
dependence) hold them fast together; they would
soon shatter and dissolve into saddest Confusion.
For though the Machin of the Universe, be as august,
as it is immense; yet were it not for the accurate
Symmetry of its parts, so skilfully fitted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
amongst themselves and for the mutual
support which one piece derives and affords to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
by means of that necessary and elegant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture,
which runs through the whole habit or
<hi>Compages</hi> thereof; it would immediately fall asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and rush into an heap of irreparable Ruines.
Its Motions in some places would flag and faulter;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:102637:125"/>
and in others grown as much too fierce and violent:
and so through unhappy deficiencies and redundancies
of Motion (that commonly change and destroy
Nature) post into innumerable Disorders and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements;
and so become a most lamentably ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
thing, eternally devoid of all beauty and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>And the very same would happen to the Earth in
its Proportion. It is now a very goodly piece, and
incomparably furnisht and adorned. There are few
places in it but afford taking Prospects, or present
the eye with such pretty Objects; that if the
Beholders be not too incurious, they may well be
affected with them. Herbs, Flowers, Trees, Fruits,
Springs, Brooks, Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with what variety,
and in what abundance does it send forth? But
yet let the Clouds we speak of, with-hold their moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
but a few years; and what a rueful change would
then appear? The choicest Grounds which now swell
with Plenty, and luxuriate with fatness and pleasing
Gayeties; would be miserably exhausted, and their
tempting amoenities turned into horridness. They
would be quite devested of their florid attire, and
of all their rich and gorgeous habiliments. Yea,
not only their wanton gawdy Dresses, but even
their coarsest and most ordinary Cloaths would be

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>indg'd off their Backs: and being stript of their
decent necessary Garments, would have nothing le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
to cover their nakedness.</p>
               <p>We live in an Island, where (according to
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s phrase) the Earth stands <hi>in the Waters
and out of the Waters,</hi> more than in other places.
Yet, as much Water as we have about us, should
the Clouds be unkind, and deny us their effusio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s;
to what grievous straits should we soon be reduced?
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:102637:126"/>
We may justly conclude so, from what has happen'd
by some short Droughts amongst us; the effects of
which are found upon Record in our <hi>English</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles.
And if a little dry weather be intolerable
to <hi>us,</hi> who dwell so near the Seas, and have <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>'s
Territories round about us; how extreamly
pernicious must lasting Droughts be, to higher or more
In-land Situations?</p>
               <p>But therefore the <hi>First Vse</hi> of the Clouds, is to
keep the Earth in a Flourishing Condition. To
temper the immoderate heat of the Sun, and to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage
his scorching fury. To moisten the Air, and
keep it cool; and to cool the Earth by keeping it
moist. That so once in a year at least it might put
on its bravery, and be deckt and array'd in its
prideless Gallantry; the Image of its native finery,
and those higher glories, wherewith at first it was
better beautified and imbellisht. And therefore when
GOD brings the Clouds over it, to perform their
work of natural Distillation; He is said to do it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>for <hi>hiz</hi> Earth;</hi> in the quoted Text. Because the
Earth is <hi>His,</hi> and because it might continue to be
<hi>like</hi> his; that is, Comely and Graceful. Whereas
if Clouds by their Waters should not refresh it, in
a short time it would scarce be fit to be owned for
GOD's Earth. It would be so fear and bare, and
barren and desolate; that it would hardly look like
a piece of <hi>His</hi> Workmanship. Yea, so parched would
it be, and so dry would it grow, and such heats
would it conceive from the inflaming Sun; that it
would be forced to anticipate its final Destiny, by
burning, in good measure, before the Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:102637:126"/>
Secondly, <hi>The Clouds are</hi> Vseful <hi>for Mercy.
<hi>They do not keep the Earth from Desolation, and
help to maintain it in a Condition good and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,
upon its</hi>
                  </hi> own <hi>account only, but upon</hi> ours
<hi>also. That so we may be fed, and cloathed, and
furnished, with its valuable Products, and the fruits
of its increase. The</hi> Psalmist <hi>(if we would read
this in Holy Stile) expresses it thus:</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> Thou
visitest the earth and blessest it, Thou makest it very
plenteous. Thou waterest her furrows, Thou sendest
rain into the little valleys thereof; Thou makest it
soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.
thou crownest the year with thy goodness, and thy
clouds drop fatness. They shall drop upon the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of the wilderness, and the little hills shall rejoice
on every side. The folds shall be full of sheep,
the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn, that
they shall laugh and sing. <hi>And in another place.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 13, 14, 15.</note> He watereth the hills from above, the earth is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the fruit of thy works. He bringeth forth
grass for the cattle, and green herb for the service of
man. That he may bring food out of the earth, and
wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oyl to
make him a chearful countenance, and bread to strengthen
man's heart.</p>
               <p>But this is not <hi>all</hi> the mercy which showrs
down from the Clouds. They drop an higher mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
on us still. I mean as they are an Argument,
and a mighty Argument, against the black and cursed
sin of <hi>Atheism.</hi> For being notable Instruments of
Divine Providence, they so bear witness in a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
manner to the existence of a GOD. And
therefore when as great a Disputant as ever entered
the Christian Schools (except the adorable Master
of them) would have reasoned Men into an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102637:127"/>
of the True GOD; he argued from
this very <hi>Topic,</hi> the <hi>Clouds;</hi> or (which is all one)
from the Rain they afforded. Yea, he told them
plainly, That GOD himself made use of it as an
Evidence, to prove and attest his own being. <hi>He
left not himself without witness, in that he gave us
<hi>Rain,</hi> Acts</hi> 14. 17. And truly he that shall consider
all the <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> of this <hi>Meteor,</hi> and trace it along
from its Rise or Generation, to its fall and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
effects upon the Earth; will find it of singular
force to evince a DEITY.</p>
               <p>As for the Causes, Nature, and Qualities of <hi>Rain;</hi>
the way of its Production, the manner of its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Apostle urged them not: he
knew those things were too high for the Men of
<hi>Lystra.</hi> But then he pressed them with the thing
<hi>another</hi> way, more suitable to their Capacity;
namely, As Rain was a means of the Earth's being
fruitful. <hi>He gave us <hi>Rains</hi> and <hi>fruitful</hi> seasons.</hi>
Pursue it but on this part, and how powerful an
Argument or Testimony will it be, of the Existence
of a GOD? I mean, as it will appear to be a
wonderful Instrument, exactly sitted for its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
work; and as it manifests a strange Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
Contrivance, in adapting it, in point of
congruity and ability, to be the excellent Cause of
such signal Effects.</p>
               <p>For suppose the most understanding Man, as to
that concern, in the whole World; had Woods and
Nurseries, and Orchards and Gardens, and Fields
and Pastures, to be watered: how would he chuse
to have it done, so as it might be most for <hi>their,</hi> and
consequently for <hi>his own</hi> advantage? Why, in the
same way we shall find it done by the <hi>Clouds,</hi> only
better and indeed so much better, that it will be
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102637:127"/>
very hard, if not impossible, for <hi>Art</hi> to match it
by any Invention. A certain Indication, that a
more than ordinary or Humane Wisdom, is inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed
in the Affair. That the Clouds were made,
that is, and also are managed by a GOD; whose
Infinite Wisdom indu'd them with that Nature,
and placed them in that Order, and put them in
that capacity of serving us as they do. So incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably,
that is, as no wit of Man can mend their
Method. For let the skilfullest, I say, chuse at
what rate he would have his Grounds to be watered;
and then see if the Clouds commonly come not up
to his Rules, and exceed them too in what is fit to
be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We may be sure he would appoint <hi>the best
kind of Water to be used.</hi> And what Water so fit
for all sorts of Plants, as that which descends from
the Clouds above? For considering how it is raised
by the exhalative influence of the Sun, it can have
nothing of saltness, acrimony, or deadness in it; nor
yet of starving thinness nor coldness neither; but
must be as light, and unctuous and spirituous, as
that Element, when simple, can well be; and by
vertue of its sutable qualities and consistency, be
most proper for invigorating the Seminals of all
things. And then being drawn up from all parts
of the Earth almost; as simple as it seems to be,
there must needs be very great mixture in it. I mean,
though it be all Water, yet it must be a Compound
of all Waters as it were; as being an extract of all
sorts of moisture that the Earth affords in its several
Regions. Whence it follows, that all sorts of Plants
must find something in it (it being originally in part
derived perhaps from the Countries in which they
grow) highly agreeable to themselves; as consisting
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102637:128"/>
of Particles fit to enter them, and easie to be turned
into their substance. Which being suckt up by
them, and drained by exquisite percolation through
their fine digestive Pores; immediately becomes Sap
(which is the Plantal Chyle or Blood) for their
nourishment and accretion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Without question he would have these
Waterings <hi>seasonably performed.</hi> And here the Clouds
are most kind to Vegetables again; and by a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
method answer their necessities. For they yield
both former and latter Rains. Such as may cherish
them while they are young and make them grow;
and strengthen them as they grow, and carry them
on to perfection. Whereas if all these Rains should
fall at first, the tender Springals would come to
nothing; as being surfeited with too much moisture,
and the principle of their Life irrecoverably chill'd,
if not extinguisht. And if all should pour down
upon them at last, the Showres would be to no
purpose. For coming too late, they would be in
vain: especially as to all Frugiferous things; which
being shrunk and stunted with immoderate exicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
would be unable to yield their kindly
Products.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We need not doubt but he would have his
Grounds watered <hi>in a gentle manner.</hi> And this, I
may say, the Clouds do unimitably. Sometimes
with dewy Mists; sometimes with greater, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with lesser, commonly with soft and moderate
Showres. Whereas should they discharge themselves
in extravagant quantities; they would wash up the
weaker, and beat down the stronger Plants; and
by their too free and impetuous Defluxions, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
injurious, if not fatal to both.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:102637:128"/>And can we think that what we have noted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
should be done by meer <hi>accident?</hi> That the
Regions above, which need them not, but are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
clogged and cumbred with them; should draw
up such plenty of Waters for <hi>us,</hi> who cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
subsist without them: and then send them down
again of so elaborate a nature, at so seasonable times,
and in so sutable measures: and all by casual Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
and the conduct of blind and incertain
Chance?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We may ground upon it that he would
have these Waterings to be <hi>constant.</hi> Not only for
two or three Months, or some few years; but so
long as he lives at least, to name no longer period.
Nor are the Clouds deficient in this circumstance
neither. For as they have watered the Earth through
all ages past, so they will do the same indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
for the future, even till the final Consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all things. And though no <hi>one Sett</hi> of
Clouds can ever be fixed or permanent, they being
perpetually flitting and volant; yet as some fly from
us, others arise; and so from new successions of
them, we have supplys of fresh Rain. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
albeit they are passant things, they leave very
good and lasting effects of their transient fugitive
presence with us. And here the hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is visible again. For put case that things by
a fortuitous hit, had fallen luckily at first into that
convenient posture for Rain, in which now they
stand (which would be most surprising to think;)
yet that then they should persist of themselves, so
long, and steddily, and inalterably in the same; is
not to be imagined. No, where the Wheel of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
runs on in so even, and withal in so laudable and
holding a Course; 'tis a plain case that its Motions
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:102637:129"/>
were derived from the impulse of Heaven; and are
maintained by the help of a Divine Influence, or
Providential Direction and Concurrence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We may reasonably conclude, that he would
appoint things to be watered <hi>intermittingly.</hi> Lest too
much driness together, should injure them on the
one side; or too much moisture prejudice or bane
them on the other. Nor are the Clouds faulty in
this piece of service, but perform it as it were, with
a great deal of care and seeming Officiousness. For
when they have poured out their kindness liberally
on the Earth, they usually stop up their Bottles
again; and by suspending their effusions promote its
fruitfulness; as well as by sending them down upon
it. For as Rains that are new and fresh from above,
are most nourishing to Vegetables; so their intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
descents make them to be more nutritive still.
For then having drunk up and digested those that
are past; they become more receptive of them that
succeed. And so sucking in what is fit for their ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the more greediness; they disperse and
concoct it with the more ease and speed.</p>
               <p>And truly in the alternate vicissitudes of wet and dry
weather, there is something, at times, most remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<hi>Providential.</hi> For when we have had sore and
tedious Rains, for that very reason they should hold
and increase; because Nature is prepared and inabled
thereunto by abundance of Vapours. And when
we have had a long and excessive drought, for the
same reason it should continue; because Nature is
sitted to carry it on; the parched ground affording
fewer Exhalations, and there being a scarcity of
matter out of which Rains should be made. Yet
(as experience proves) it happens not thus, but on
the contrary. For when Nature's Disposition in the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:102637:129"/>
case, does sensibly stand one way; she is turned about,
and as it were against her seeming and set Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
led into another. Which whispers and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
to the thinking Man, that she is certainly
directed by an hand from above, and in these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terintentional
and undesigned changes (as we may
call them) is over-ruled by a power superior
to her own; and also joined with such Wisdom,
as orders her much better than she could do her
self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> We may presume that this Person would
certainly have <hi>all</hi> his Grounds to be watered. That
the one might be fruitful as well as the other,
and all of them recompence the impartial care, with
a general Fructification. And here the Clouds are
not at all defective, but act their part in this neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
scene, most unexceptionably. For they spread
out their melting dripping Wings even far and near;
and oblige the whole Earth where it needs, (not
to say where it has no want) with their most free
and universal Disbursements. And truly were it not
for their Waters so copiously shed down on the
Earth, how miserable would the Condition of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
be? But then when things are so well and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
ordered; as that a blessing so needful, is made
so general; and is every where so common and easie
to be had: what a bright beam of Conviction, as to
the Being of a DEITY, darts forth and shines down
from the blackest Clouds? For who but the Great
GOD could have stretcht out such Fountains in the
Spatious Skies; and for the needs of Men throughout
the World, have invented so adequate and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Supplies?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:102637:130"/>Nor indeed are they Instruments of <hi>Common</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
only; but vehicles oft times of <hi>Special</hi> secular Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and Prosperity, to some Persons. So it appears
by <hi>Eliphaz</hi>'s Advertisement; who tells us, That
GOD <hi>giveth rain upon the earth, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndeth waters upon
the fields; to set up on high those that be low,
Iob</hi> 5. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Thus we have seen how beneficial Rain from the
Clouds is, as to the <hi>Earth.</hi> In which respect when
GOD pleases to send it, 'tis said to come, <hi>for HIS
Earth;</hi> as above noted. We have also seen how
beneficial it is to <hi>Men,</hi> in watering their Possessions:
and that in so singular a way, as the wisest could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have projected a better. In which regard it is
said to come, <hi>for mercy.</hi> And so it does most sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
not only as it fills Men with <hi>Temporal</hi> good
things for the use of their Bodies: but moreover as
it is, or may be, a means of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Mercy to
their Souls; in ministring an Universal Argument
to Mankind, of the greatest <hi>Truth,</hi> and most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>But then in the Third place (to pursue and fill
up the Holy Man's Distinction) it is <hi>Vseful, for
Correction.</hi> As GOD is infinitely Good in Himself;
so He alone is able to bring good out of evil. That's
an Extract which none but the ALMIGHTY by
a most Divine. Chymistry peculiar to his MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JESTY,
is able to make. And this he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
does for those, in whose pure Affections he dwells
and rules. <hi>All things work together for good to them
that love GOD, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. But then there is
another piece of his Character as true; That<note n="*" place="margin">Isai. 66. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>He
will render recompence to his enemies,</hi> and<note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 20. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>visit ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
upon them that hate him.</hi> And as he has num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berless
ways of doing this; so he often effects it by
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102637:130"/>
changing things that are of necessary use, into fatal
influence. Whereby he makes what is <hi>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>urally</hi> good

                  <hi>occasion of
falling.</hi> Most evident is this in the Instance of Rain.
So needful is it, that we cannot subsist without it.
Yet this very thing, GOD turns, when he pleases,
into an heavy Rod; and by making it unseasonable
or else excessive, chasteneth his People sorely with
it. Yea, he imploys it not only as a Rod to
chastise his Servants; but sometimes as a Sword
to cut off his Adversaries; and an Instrument of
Vengeance to sweep away the ungodly in whole
sholes or multitudes. This was never so tragically
apparent, as in <hi>Noah's</hi> Flood; when a great part of
that generall destructive, but deserved Blow, which
fell upon Mankind, was given by this Weapon. For
by the Waters of Rain in conjunction with other Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
a period was put to the first sinful World, by a
very just, though lamentable Catastrophe.</p>
               <p>And when the Clouds and their Rains, or <hi>the waters
above the firmament,</hi> were so very considerable <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi>
and withal so very <hi>useful</hi> in way of <hi>Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to the <hi>Earth;</hi> and in way of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Iudgment,</hi>
as reaching out GOD's favour and severity to the
World: Why should they not be worthy, and highly
worthy, of <hi>Moses</hi>'s notice in his Divine Cosmology? The
Holy <hi>Psalmist</hi> (who we are sure spake by the same Spirit
that <hi>Moses</hi> did) looks upon the Clouds as mighty
eminent and remarkable things. For as he makes them
to be GOD's <hi>Chariot, Psal.</hi> 104. 3. So in another place,
he makes them notable Evidences of his Magnificence
and Power;<note n="†" place="margin">

                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:102637:131"/>
6. <hi>But against the Existence of</hi> open Seas <hi>at first, it
is farther objected, thus,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Nec aquae congregantur omnes in eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem locum; nam praeter multos lacus salsos, &amp; ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quos forsan sinus Maris olim impervios, Mare <hi>Caspium</hi> quod ejusdem est originis &amp; antiquitatis cum magno Oceano, ab eodem longe disjunctum est. <hi>Theor. pag.</hi> 123.</note> Nor are the Waters ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<hi>all</hi> into the same place; for besides many salt Lakes,
and some gulfs of the Sea perhaps heretofore impervious,
the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, which is of the same origin and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
with the great Ocean, is far separate from it.</p>
               <p>To take off which, I answer; That <hi>Moses</hi> does not
say, Let ALL the Waters be gathered into one place.
Though if he had, the word ALL, in Scripture,
is usually taken in a restrained sense, to signifie but a
<hi>Major</hi> part: and so here it might have meant but
the greater quantity of Waters. To give Proof of this
out of the Writings of <hi>Moses.</hi> He tells us,<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 50. 7.</note> That
<hi>ALL the servants of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>went up with</hi> Joseph
<hi>to bury his Father.</hi> Yet we cannot think that the
Court was quite empty at that time, and the King
left wholly without Attendants. And therefore, ALL,
there, must denote but <hi>a great many.</hi> So he delivered
it as a Law to <hi>Israel;</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Deut. 16. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Three times in a year shall ALL
thy males appear before the LORD thy GOD, in the place
which he shall chuse.</hi> And yet we know that some of
them at those times must be decrepit, and some sick,
and some unclean; and so unable to take such a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and unfit to make such an appearance. And
therefore by, ALL, here, can be intended but, <hi>many,</hi>
neither; even as many as were capable of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
or qualified for it. And thus indeed ALL
the Waters were gathered into one place. That is, the
great quantity or main Body of them was so: as they
were incorporate and united in the Ocean. Which
whereever it diffuseth and insinuateth it self about the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:102637:131"/>
Earth, is but one continued piece of Water, and
so fills one continued space with its huge <hi>moles.</hi> I
speak of a <hi>partial,</hi> and sometimes a <hi>secret</hi> continui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for it is not always open, visible, and entire.
And that the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea is a part of the great
Sea, and holds a secret commerce with it under
ground (as the dead Sea, or Lake <hi>Asphaltites,</hi> is
presumed to do with the <hi>Mediterranean</hi>) is clear
from hence; that it receives such an abundance of
Waters into it self, and swells not with them. For
though the Stream of <hi>Volga</hi> (which is thought to
afford Waters enough in a Years time to drown the
whole Earth) continually discharges it self into the
<hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; it is never the fuller. And therefore
the <hi>Theory</hi> need not have instanced in that Sea as a
distinct and separate Sea by it self. Especially when
it allows it to<note n="*" place="margin">

that are distinct as to themselves, and divided from
the Ocean; how inconsiderable are they in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it? But as so many Buckets-full to a large
Pool. Yet should the Waters run out of some
huge Pool, and settle together elsewhere; as it
might truly be said of them then, that they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together into one place, though many Buckets<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
should lodge in Plashes by the way: so the
Waters in general, may rightly be affirmed by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
to be gathered together into one place; though
a Multitude of small Receptacles, and the <hi>Caspian,</hi>
larger than the rest, remain apart.</p>

                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:102637:132"/>
7. But a Third Objection is yet to be removed
(for I am willing to encounter all that are Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial)
which is this. If the Earth had <hi>Open Seas</hi>
at first, dividing it into <hi>Continents</hi> and <hi>Islands,</hi> and
interlacing and environing them, as now they do;
how could the several parts thereof, so separate, be
peopled with Men and stockt with Beasts? Or to
use the words of the <hi>Theory,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Propagatio &amp; traductio hominum &amp; animalium, in tot mundos se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratos, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilis esset ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatu.</hi> Ibid. pag. 123.</note> 
                  <hi>The propagating or
conveying of Men and Animals into so many sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Worlds, would be difficult to explain.</hi> I
answer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is as difficult to make out how the Earth
should be peopled before the Flood, though the
surface of it had been entire. I mean upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>that Torrid Zone</hi> which the <hi>Theory</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
to have been in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Islands at first might be nothing so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
as they are since. But as many of them
were founded, as I may say, after the Earth; so
many of them may be of later date than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.
Which factitious or upstart Isles came into
being Three ways.</p>
               <p>Some were produced of an abundance of Filth,
rolling down the Streams of Rivers, and running into
the Sea and settling there. So were the <hi>Echinades,</hi>
spoken of before. Concerning whose Production
therefore, <hi>Ovid</hi> makes the River out of which they
came, to speak thus,
<q>
                     <l>—Fluctus nosterque marisque</l>
                     <l>Continuam deduxit humum, pariterque revellit</l>
                     <l>In totidem mediis (quòd cernis) <hi>Echinadas,</hi> undis.</l>

Others were thrust up in some Seas, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on a sudden. Of this sort was <hi>Rhodos</hi> in the
<hi>Carpathian</hi> Sea, an hundred and twenty Miles in
compass; one of the ancient Academies of the <hi>Roman</hi>

Twelve <hi>Sporades</hi> (I think) or at least not far off
them, as lying near to <hi>Melos,</hi> one of the chief of
them. <hi>Thera,</hi> called also <hi>Calliste,</hi> where <hi>Callimachus</hi>
the Poet was born, and whence they went who built
<hi>Cyrene.</hi> It appeared first, in the fourth year of the
hundred and thirty fifth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> as<note n="†" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>l. 2. cap. 87. l. 4. c.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates;
and from it was the Ilet <hi>Therasia</hi> broken off.
<hi>Hiera,</hi> the same with <hi>Automate,</hi> which appeared
about an hundred and thirty years after: <hi>even in our
time</hi> (says the same <hi>Pliny) upon the Eighth day
before the</hi> Ides <hi>of</hi> July, <hi>when</hi> M. Junius Syllanus,
<hi>and</hi> Lucius Balbus <hi>were Consuls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other Islands again have been made by Disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from the Main-land. As some have
been joined to Continents and become one with
them; as <hi>Aethusa</hi> in the <hi>Lybian</hi> Sea, to <hi>Mundus;
Zephyria,</hi> to <hi>Halicarnassus</hi> in <hi>Caria; Narthecusa,</hi>
to <hi>Parthenius,</hi> a Promontory of <hi>Arcadla; Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banda,</hi>
to <hi>Ionia,</hi> and the like: so some on the
contrary have been ravished or rent away from the
firm Land. Thus <hi>Prochyta</hi> an Island in the <hi>Tuscan</hi>
Sea, was raised not far from <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  <hi>Delos</hi> also above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
does. <hi>Cyprus,</hi> a noted Island in the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,</hi>
was divided from <hi>Syria,</hi> says <hi>Pliny;</hi>
whence it is now distant at least an hundred Miles.
<hi>Sicily,</hi> from <hi>Italy. Euboea,</hi> from <hi>Boeotia. Besbycus,</hi>
from <hi>Bithynia.</hi> And as some have thought, <hi>Britain,</hi>
from <hi>France.</hi> And truly if <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which
are now so remote from one another, were once uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
this makes it the more probable, that <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>France</hi> might (time out of mind) have been
joined by an <hi>Isthmus</hi> or neck of Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may be answered, That as Islands at
first were not so <hi>numerous;</hi> so the bigger of them
might not lie so far off from Continents as now they
do: the Earth being since much eaten away by
Waters, and so the distance betwixt them made
much wider. Or if they did lie so far from the
Main-land, yet the Inhabitants of such Lands,
might advance into the distant Isles, by the help of
some rude kind of Boats made of hollow Trees,
or the like. Or if any were such out-liers, as that
they did not designedly make towards them, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
hit upon them; we may without incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
grant them never to have been inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.
And so we read of that <hi>African</hi> Island,
St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lantic</hi> Ocean, under the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial;
that at its first discovery (though since the
Flood) it was unpeopled, and had nothing in it but
Woods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> I answer, As to the grand Continents of
the Earth; <hi>Europe, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> (which are
three of them) have known Inlets by Lands, into
one another. And for ought we can tell, there may be
Inlets out of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>America,</hi> in the Northern parts
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:102637:133"/>
of them. But however we are sure it is but a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Strait, that separates the Kingdom of <hi>Anian</hi>
from <hi>Tartary.</hi> And who can say but that before
the Flood (and perhaps for a good while after it)
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> might be some Neck of Land coupling both
together, and affording an easie Passage out of the
one into the other; which may be since washt down
or swallowed up? For as the Earth does sometimes
gain strangely upon the Water (witness the City
of <hi>Antioch</hi> (to say nothing of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the Bay of
<hi>Ambrasia,</hi> the Flats of <hi>Teuthrania,</hi> and the now
Meadowy level where <hi>Maeander</hi> runs, once belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Empire) which at first, says
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Nat. Hist. l. 6. c.</hi> 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Pliny,</hi> stood upon the Sea coast, but even in his
time became an hundred and twenty five Miles
distant from it:) so the Sea otherwhiles prevailes
as much against the Land. Thus, the <hi>Atlantis,</hi> a
vast Continent, bigger than <hi>Libya</hi> and all <hi>Asia,</hi> (says
<note n="†" place="margin">In Timaeo.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi>) by a terrible Earthquake, lasting a day
and a night, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, sunk down into
the Sea and disappeared. And he that would see
what the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> has devoured, let him but
read the short Ninetieth Chapter of the Second
Book of <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Natural History: where he gives
a brief Account of what incroachments it has made
in <hi>Acarnania, Achaia,</hi> in the <hi>Propontis, Pontus,</hi> &amp;c.
And when the Sea has been thus usurping upon
the Land, and has made violent breaches in
several places; why might it not make a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
for its Waters between <hi>Tartary</hi> and <hi>Anian,</hi>
though there was none at first? or why might
not the ground sink there by an Earthquake, or
the like?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:102637:134"/>But grant the <hi>Streight</hi> we speak of, to have been
ever the same that now it is: yet it will not be
over difficult then neither, to conceive how <hi>America</hi>
should come to be inhabited. As for <hi>Quivira,</hi> which
lies right against <hi>China,</hi> and joines to <hi>Anian;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat
<hi>that</hi> was peopled out of <hi>Tartary,</hi> is not to be doubted.
The course of Life which the <hi>Americans</hi> were found
to lead thereabouts, does fairly show it; as being
correspondent to that of the <hi>Tartarian Hordes,</hi> or
<hi>Scythian Nomades.</hi> Only the Question will be, How
the <hi>Tartars</hi> could swim over this Arm of the Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as having no shipping. For the resolving of which,
we need but consider; that when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> grew
acquainted with <hi>America,</hi> they found that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
upon the Coasts thereof, used little Boats made
of the Trunks of Trees, hollowed (not by Iron
Instruments, because they had none; but) by fire.
Now grant but the <hi>Tartars</hi> (who dwelt upon the
Coasts opposite to <hi>Anian</hi>) to have used the like;
and how easily might they at times be accidentally
hurried thither, in those sorry Sciphs, before they
were aware? and so begin the Plantation of the
<hi>American</hi> World. And then do but yeild that the
Inhabitants of <hi>Tartary</hi> before the Flood, were but
as ingenious at making these <hi>Canoes,</hi> and as addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the use of them; and it might <hi>then</hi> be peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
the same way. Though what better Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
for Transportation, the Antediluvian <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
(as I may call them) might have; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say. Nor can we hope ever certainly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
who were the <hi>Aborigines,</hi> or first Planters
of the Post-diluvian <hi>Americans;</hi> or how they came
into that spatious Tract of Ground, that half of

For the Natives being Strangers to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:102637:134"/>
have no History amongst them, or Records of

               <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
               <head type="sub">1. The Scripture's Silence touching the Rain-bow,
before the Flood, does not argue its non-appearance
till after it. 2. Its appearance from the beginning,
no hindrance or diminution of its Federal Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy.
3. But matter of congruence to GOD's
Method of Proceeding in other Cases. 4. Clouds
were extant before the Flood, and therefore the
Rain-bow was so. 5. The Conclusion of this
Chapter, relating to the Two foregoing ones
also.</head>
               <p>1. I Should now have passed directly to the next
<hi>vital</hi> or <hi>primary</hi> Assertion of the <hi>Theory.</hi> But
there being no fitter place to do it in, I shall here
bestow one short Chapter upon the <hi>Rain-bow.</hi> For
that also is made use of collaterally, to support the
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> we dispute against. Concerning it, GOD
expresseth himself thus,<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 9. 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>I do set my Bow in the
Cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
me and the Earth. And it shall come to pass,
when I bring a cloud over the Earth, that the Bow
shall be seen in the cloud.</hi> And because we heard
nothing of it till <hi>now,</hi> 'tis presumed that it never
appeared before. But by the same reason we may as
well conclude, That a <hi>Cloud</hi> was never seen before
neither; because here we find the <hi>first</hi> mention made
of one. Which must needs be false, inasmuch as
the Flood proceeded in great measure from violent
Rains. And to suppose Rains without a Cloud,
is the same absurdity, as to suppose Children with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Mother. And therefore our hearing nothing
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102637:135"/>
of the Rainbow, till the Flood was past; is no good
Argument that it <hi>was</hi> not, but that it was not <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant,</hi>
before. And it is most like that we had
not heard of it at last in the Sacred Volume (no
more than we do of <hi>Comets, Eclipses,</hi> &amp;c.) i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it
had not been turn'd into a Pledge of Mercy to us.
And in this sense, as it was made a Symbol of
the merciful Covenant; GOD might say em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically,
<hi>I do set my bow in the Cloud,</hi> when he
struck this Covenant with <hi>Noah.</hi> It was in the
Cloud indeed before, but then it was only of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's</hi>
setting there; and so it was but a meer <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi>
or at least made no other Figure, but that of
a bare <hi>Physical Meteor.</hi> But afterward when by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
appointment, it became useful beyond its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
capacity, and never appeared without something
in it more taking than its colours; as being cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a rare additional excellency, the new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of a preternatural Signality: then, and ever
since it might more justly and peculiarly be said,
to be set in the Cloud <hi>by GOD.</hi> For though it
stands there still in a natural and ordinary way;
yet it serves to an extraordinary and supernatural
end, and he it is that made it do so.</p>
               <p>2. Nor would this significancy which the AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY
put upon it, be at all impeached by its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting
from the <hi>Beginning.</hi> For though it had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>red
as commonly before the Deluge, as ever it
did since; it would not for that have been the
less authentick or assuring token of GOD's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
or of his sidelity in keeping the same. For
its force that way, depended not upon the Nature
of the thing (applied to this symbolical use) but
upon Heavens Institution. So that if GOD had
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102637:136"/>
appointed the <hi>Sun</hi> to that use, he would have sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
the same thing that the <hi>Bow</hi> does; though as
all must grant, the <hi>Bow</hi> is the most fit Emblem of
the two; and therefore it was chosen. For <hi>that</hi>
never shows it self but in a Cloud, and with a
Rain; both which were instrumental to the great
Inundation: and so serve most properly to mind us
of it, and from thence to pass our thoughts to GOD's
Promise, of securing the World from such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Were it yielded therefore, that there never was
a Rainbow, till that <hi>Noah</hi> saw after the Flood;
what considerable Point would be gained as to
GOD's Design in exhibiting of it? What clearer
Token would it have been of his Covenant? What
stronger support of Mens confidence in it? the two
principal Ends whereunto it was appointed. Why
should <hi>we</hi> (for instance) that are now alive, be the
more firmly perswaded of the Truth of GOD's
Compact, or the more fully satisfied that he will
surely stand to it? Indeed if it had been a <hi>New</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition;
by being so very fine and curious, it might
have wrought prettily upon <hi>Noah</hi>'s Phancy, and
theirs who were with him. Especially it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with such a Promise of Mercy, and finding them
in the midst of such ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tly ruines. But bating but
this, that its <hi>Newness</hi> might sweetly affect its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
making delightful and somewhat surprizing
Impressions on their Minds, and raising in them
little transports and wondrings; what great benefit
could result from it? As to the Persons then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it would have been a most valid Ratification
of the Divine Covenant, without its novity: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
turned into a Seal of an immutable Promise of
Security against general Floods to come, made by
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102637:136"/>
that GOD who had justly delivered them, and
that most miraculously, from one lately past. And
as to after Generations, it must be all one to them,
whether the Celestial bow was first exhibited since
the Deluge, or before it. For as many as think
aright concerning it, that it is an Effect of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Causes; and that the rorid Cloud, the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Sun, and the Eye of the Spectator, being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disposed, so as to make due Refractions and
Reflections of the Sun-beams at requisite Angles, it
must as necessarily appear as fire must burn: they
cannot discern any shadow of reason, why it should
not as well assure them the World should be drowned
no more, had it been extant ever since the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as if it had commenced its appearance at the
drying up of the Flood. To be short; whenever
it appears, it is because it cannot do otherwise:
but when it does appear, it betokens the Earth's
preservation from drowning, meerly upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of GOD's Ordinance, that so it should do.
And therefore it might be as good a <hi>Prognostic</hi> or
Token of the Worlds indemnity from a second
Flood, though it had appeared in all Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
as if it had then shown it self <hi>first,</hi> when
GOD was pleas'd to make it the Sign of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>3. And indeed it is the way or method of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
both in its <hi>Penal</hi> and <hi>Propitious</hi> Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to make known, and common, natural, and
familiar things, Marks of his Displeasure, and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
and Vehicles of its kindness and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:102637:137"/>Thus, as to Punishment, it was a piece of the
Serpet's Curse, that he <hi>should go upon his belly.</hi> Yet
it does not appear that this Malediction deprived him
of Legs, or that he and his <hi>Species</hi> ever went erect.
So it was made part of the Womans Sentence, that
her Husband should <hi>rule over her.</hi> Yet her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
before, was a State of Subjection to him,
as intimated to proceed from the order of her<note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 13.</note> Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
So that what stands clearly imputed to her
sin, and seems to be the plain Consequent of her
Guilt, and the effect of her Doom; was antecedent
to the same, and the Lot of her Innocence. Only
Circumstances were altered, and what was sweet
and easie as Nature at first; was unhappily
changed into trouble and penance, in the issue of
things.</p>
               <p>And the like is observable in the Oeconomy of
Mercy. I mean, in the very conduct of Religion
it self, and that in the sublimest Mysteries thereof.
For the Evangelical Sacraments were instituted in
<hi>Water, Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> for sealing and ratifying
a far nobler Covenant, than that betwixt GOD
and the Patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi> extending to his Posterity,
and all living Creatures. And yet these were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Elements, and of ordinary use at all times.
Only positive Commands and Divine Institution im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
them into means of Christian Proselytism,
and Communion with the DEITY.</p>
               <p>And this makes it the more probable, that the
Rainbow was an usual Meteor. Because then
GOD in giving it to the World in Confirmation
of his Promise or Pact; would have acted most
consonantly to his other proceedings. Yea, even
to his proceedings in the highest and holiest Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Religion; of nearest intercourse with His
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:102637:137"/>
MAJESTY, and so of greatest importance to
Mankind. For there he has made the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
things, to be Signs and Mystical Deferents
of himself, and his Favours, to all worthy Partakers
of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> all such instances, <hi>says the</hi> Theory, fall short,
and do not reach the case <hi>before us.</hi>

                  <hi>For</hi> a sign
confirmatory of a Promise, when there is something af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<hi>de futuro</hi>—must indispensably be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>New.</hi> Otherwise it cannot have the Nature,
Vertue, and influence of a Sign. <hi>And a little before,</hi>
Such Signs—must be some <hi>new</hi> appearance, and
must thereby induce us to believe the effect—
otherwise the pretended Sign is a meer Cypher and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, As to Signs given by GOD,
to confirm his Promises; he has taken a Latitude
to himself in chusing and appointing them. For,</p>
               <p>Sometimes he has made things <hi>new</hi> and <hi>strange</hi>
to be Signs of this nature. Thus, his own Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Dumbness, was to be a Sign to <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi>
of his Promised Son. The Retrogradation of
the Shadow on <hi>Ahaz</hi>'s Dial, was to be a Sign to
<hi>Hezekiah,</hi> of his promised Recovery. And the
Fleece expos'd to the Dew, first <hi>wet,</hi> and then <hi>dry,</hi>
was to be a Sign to <hi>Gideon,</hi> of his promised Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
But then,</p>
               <p>Sometimes he has made things to be Signs, that
on the other side are <hi>common</hi> and <hi>usual.</hi> Thus the
Fruit of a Tree growing in Paradise, was made a
Sign of Man's Immortality, if he continued Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient:
and therefore it was called <hi>The Tree of Life,</hi>
say many of the Learned. And shooting with
Bow and Arrows upon the ground (than which
nothing could be more ordinary) was made a Sign
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:102637:138"/>
to <hi>Ioash</hi> of his prevailing against the <hi>Syrians.</hi> And
therefore when he shot, the Arrow was called
<hi>The Arrow of the LORD's deliverance from</hi> Syria,
2 Kings 13. 17. Here was<note n="*" place="margin">Piscat. in loc.</note> 
                  <hi>sagitta significans &amp;
promittens salutem;</hi> or, in the <hi>Theory</hi>'s words, <hi>a sign
confirmatory of a Promise,</hi> wherein <hi>there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
affirmed</hi> de futuro; but it had nothing <hi>new</hi>
or <hi>extraordinary</hi> in it (the thing being most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and usual) save only that GOD by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
intimated its significancy that way. But had
it not therefore <hi>the nature, vertue, and influence of
a Sign, whereby to induce the King to believe the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?
Was it a pretended sign</hi> only, and <hi>a meer Cypher
and Superfluity?</hi> The like may be said of the <hi>Rainbow.</hi>
It was no <hi>new appearance,</hi> but a <hi>Common Meteor</hi> usually
seen in the first World. But being stamped by GOD
with a signality that way; it immediately put on the
Nature, Virtue, and Influence of a confirmatory Sign;
and became able to induce <hi>Noah</hi> and his Posterity,
to believe that the Promise of the Earth's Preservation
from future drowning, shall certainly be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
according to the significancy wherewith it was
marked, to ratifie that Promise.</p>
               <p>And no wonder that things extant and <hi>common</hi>
in the World, should be made confirmatory Signs
of GOD's Promises; when things transient and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
past long before (and so not to be taken cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

never did or were to exist till long after his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
should be accomplisht (and so as yet were no

Faith) have been made such Signs. Of the first

                  <hi>the Sign of the Prophet</hi> Jonas. Whose
being vomited up of the Whale, after three days
continuance in its Belly; was made a Sign of our
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102637:138"/>
SAVIOUR's rising from the dead, after his
triduous abode in the Holy Sepulchre. Though
<hi>Ionah</hi> was swallowed, and cast up by the Fish,
near a thousand years before our LORD's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Resurrection. Of the latter sort was the
miraculous Conception and Birth of the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
which was made a Sign of safety promised to

                  <hi>Ahaz,</hi> against <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah;</hi> but was not
brought to pass till above seven hundred and forty
years after. Other instances of the same kind occur,
<hi>Exod. 3. 12. Isai.</hi> 37. 30.</p>
               <p>4. But we have a farther proof yet of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of the <hi>Rainbow</hi> before the Flood. And though
it be but indirect and consequential, yet it may not
want its weight. It is the <hi>existence of Clouds then.</hi>
For if they were before the Deluge, as they are
now; there were all causes needful for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the <hi>Iris:</hi> which could not but frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conspire or fall in with one another, so as to
paint that beautiful thing in the Heavens. And
that there were Clouds in the first World, has
been proved already by the same Arguments that
evince there was a Sea and Mountains: for they
imply and necessarily infer the being of Clouds.
The Flood also was made of Rains in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and those Rains must descend from Clouds.
And if Nature could produce Clouds <hi>then,</hi> she must
be supposed to have done it long before; as being
in a better capacity to effect it. For the Earth and
Air could never be more hot and dry, than when
the Deluge came. Scripture also gives countenance
to this, that Clouds were extant from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<hi>When he prepared the Heavens—When
he established the Clouds above,—When he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102637:139"/>
the foundations of the Earth,</hi> Prov. 8. 27, 28,
29. Whence it appears, that GOD's establishing
the Clouds, was contemporary with his preparing
the Heavens, and appointing the foundations of the
Earth. Indeed, <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Earth</hi> being both mentioned besides; <hi>Aether, Air,</hi> and
<hi>fine Dust,</hi> must be comprized in <hi>them:</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
the word here to that sense in which it
is rendred. And very properly; for besides that
<hi>Clouds</hi> are said to be <hi>the Dust of</hi> GOD's <hi>Feet,</hi>
Nah. 1. 3. the word in many places of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Volume, does denote, <hi>Clouds;</hi> and that so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and inavoidably, as it can be applied to no
other sense. Nor may we forget that clear inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or evidence rather of the early existence of
Clouds, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 7. Where the Waters above the
Firmament, must be Waters <hi>in the Clouds,</hi> as has been
already shewed. Even the <hi>Theory</hi> it self allows them
not to be <hi>Supercelestial</hi> Waters. For as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with that <hi>System</hi> of the World which it
goes upon; so it expresly disputes against them and
<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 16.</note> rejects them. And so what Waters else could
they be, save those in the Clouds? Which grant
them to have been, and how peculiarly were those
<hi>Clouds above <hi>established</hi>
                  </hi> (according to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
word) by GOD himself? when as yet there was
no Sun to exhale them from the Earth.</p>
               <p>Let this be cast in as an Overplus; the <hi>Rabbies</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
there were Rains in Paradise. (Though for
some little time there might be none, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 5.)
For when the LORD GOD put <hi>Adam</hi> into the
Garden to dress it; they understand a kind of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Cultivation of it, as he occasioned it to flourish
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102637:139"/>
by his religious Performances. Particularly he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,

                  </gap>, <hi>Gifts</hi> or <hi>Oblations</hi> for obtaining Rain
and a right Influence of the Heavens upon it. Yet
if there were Clouds and Rain, how necessarily
must the glorious Bow appear, when Showres fell
in a just position to the Sun?</p>
               <p>5. To conclude this Chapter. If any thing in
it will prove there was a <hi>Rainbow,</hi> or <hi>Clouds</hi> from the
beginning; the same will prove <hi>Mountains,</hi> and <hi>open
Seas.</hi> And if any thing in the Two precedent Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
will prove there were <hi>Mountains</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;
the same will prove <hi>Seas and Clouds.</hi> And
if any thing will prove <hi>open Seas</hi> from the beginning;
the same will prove <hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>Mountains.</hi> For these
three do mutually imply and depend on one another.
And there being no good account of their <hi>later</hi>

must in reason be thought to <hi>coexist</hi> from the <hi>first.</hi>

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:102637:140"/>
true. Whereas what we meet with in some other
Books, may be incertain, as written by Persons of
suspected Credit. <hi>Poets,</hi> for instance, are by no
means to be regarded in this matter. They are
Men of wit and licentious fiction; and when they
are struck with their proper <hi>Oestrum</hi> or Rage, and
grow warm in the vein of Romanceing; their Pens
run on at a strange rate, rangeing as far as quaint
Phancy can carry them. But as to <hi>them,</hi> let thus
much only be noted: That whereas the <hi>Theorist</hi>
applys what they write of the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> to the
Paradisiacal State before the Flood; as if what they
say, were some dark and imperfect Memoires of
that: it might be disputed (were it worth the
while) whether they set not that Age just after
the Flood; making <hi>Noah</hi> to be <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the
principal Characters of the Golden Age, to fall in
with such things as happen'd in that Period. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
(of no contemptible learning) have been of
that Opinion, and <hi>Bochart</hi> for one. As many as are
dispos'd to read what he wrote of this nature,
may find it in the first and second Chapters of his
<hi>Phaleg.</hi> And if what Poets have delivered of the
Golden Age, refers to times and things of a Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian
Date; we have no manner of reason to
regard them in the least, as giving any light either
into the Doctrine or State of Paradise.</p>
               <p>Nor truly are <hi>Fathers</hi> (those infinitely more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and solid Men) to be too much relied on in
this case neither. I mean no farther than they are
consonant to the Oracles of Heaven, and write fairly
after that inspired Copy, which came down from
thence. For though they be free from light and
Poetic Figments, they are full of <hi>Allegories</hi> and high
Rhetorications; and too <hi>Hyperbolical</hi> (erroneous some
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:102637:141"/>
of them) to be followed in all things. Thus when
<hi>Ephrem Syrus, Moses Bar Cephas, Bede, Strabus,
Rabanus Maurus</hi> and others, place Paradise near the
Circle or Orb of the Moon; and St. <hi>Basil</hi> makes it
<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>a place above the whole
Creation;</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>obscur'd with no
darkness by reason of height;</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew Masters</hi>
in general, will have it made before the World:
how can these things be tolerably reconciled to a
Terrestrial Paradise? And while some again (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Ocean to incircle the Earth) place
Paradise on the <hi>other</hi> Hemisphere; and then to bring
Men into <hi>this</hi> after <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, will have the
Ocean to be fordable, and People of that talness as
to wade through it on foot: who can believe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
had such a Situation? Especially if we add,
that other Doctors yet (of whom<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Parad. cap.</hi> 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Bar Cephas</hi>
speaks) upon account of the Site of Paradise beyond the
Ocean, held this Continent of ours was quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled
and a kind of Desart till the Flood. And
which still intangles things more and more, they
generally concluded that the four Rivers of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
were <hi>Tigris, Euphrates, Ganges,</hi> and <hi>Nilus;</hi>
and that having their Spring-heads on the other
side of the Sea, by a strange penetration or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
struck through the Earth, and brake out
on this side of the same. To follow the Fathers
here, can neither be safe nor easie. And better it
would have been, if the <hi>Theorist</hi> had not gone so far
after them; but instead of that, had kept to his
word;<note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>We will never assert any thing upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Ancients, which is not first proved by
Reason, or warranted by Scripture.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:102637:141"/>
And therefore while Poets pursue the Golden Age
in golden Dreams, and set it off in fine and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
strains: and the Fathers expatiate in too large
and lofty <hi>Encomiums</hi> of Paradise, describing such rare
and unaccountable Excellencies and <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> of
it, as it never had, but in their mistaken Idea's and
Allusions: let us wisely attend to the Voice of
GOD's SPIRIT in his unerring Word. So we
shall learn what is fit and necessary concerning
Paradise; and by keeping within the bounds of sober
truth, shall never be cumbered with superfluous
knowledge; nor be put to the trouble, first, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
humorous Notions, and then of defending
them.</p>
               <p>3. Now as to the Doctrine of Paradise, it is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comprized (so far as we need to consider it) in
the following Periods of Scripture. It will not be
amiss to bestow a short Paraphrase on them.

               <p>This is the Doctrine of Paradise, so far as at
present we are concerned to look into it. What
occurs in the Divine Story besides, is rather of
<hi>Personal,</hi> and <hi>Moral,</hi> than of <hi>Local</hi> Consideration.
It relates to <hi>Adam</hi> himself, rather than to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radisiacal
place of his residence. Only what we
find in the Close of the Third Chapter, must be taken
in; which runs as followeth:

the LORD GOD
said, Behold, the
man is become like
one of us, to know
good and evil. And
now lest he put forth
his hand, and take
also of the tree of
life, and eat, and
live for ever:</cell>

and lo, how goodlily he has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
himself in GOD-like
knowledge, which he aimed at,
and thirsted after. Since he has
been thus egregiously foolish,
'tis a thousand to one, if we let
him alone, but he'll fall into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
piece of unreasonable and
undoing folly. And if he can
but get to the Tree of Life,
and taste the Fruit of that,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:102637:144"/>

GOD immediately turned him
out of the Garden, into that
place whereabouts he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And whereas in his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disiacal
condition, he might have
subsisted deliciously of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

was to live in a more painful

4. Now what is there in all this so difficult or
abstruse, as not to be intelligible? The Doctrine of
Paradise indeed has been ill handled, as well as
some others: and has received great injury from
such as intended it nothing but kindness. Even
eminent Writers, by exalting it too high, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeing
it too much; have unhappily obscured it,
and brought a wild Confusion into it. Preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
striving to imbellish and improve it, they
have mightily eclipsed and disparaged it. Just as
a true natural Beauty is spoiled by the addition of
Artificial; and a lovely Visage, made worse by
painting. But view it in its <hi>sacred</hi> Pourtraicture, as
<hi>Scripture</hi> has drawn or represented it; and so we
shall have a fair Description, a graphical or exact
Delineation of it. So it will appear in its genuine

For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Here is nothing that turns the whole Story
into Mystery or Allegory. That makes Paradise
it self, to be the Soul; <hi>Adam,</hi> the Mind; <hi>Eve,</hi> the
Senses; the Serpent, Pleasures; the four Rivers,
four Cardinal Virtues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is the way that
<hi>Origen, Philo,</hi> and St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> go. Nor,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is there any thing that intimates, the
Garden of Paradise was the whole Earth. That
the four Rivers mentioned in the Description of it,
had the Ocean for their Fountain. And that two of
them, <hi>viz. Pison</hi> and <hi>Gihon;</hi> were <hi>Ganges</hi> and <hi>Nil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s:</hi>
the one, running through <hi>India;</hi> and the other,
through <hi>Egypt:</hi> according to the <hi>Manichees, Becanus,</hi>
and <hi>Noviomagus.</hi> Nor yet,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:102637:145"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Does it mount Paradise up above the
tops of the Hills, or assign it its Situation near the
Moon, in an Earth different from ours: where <hi>Bar
Cephas, Bede,</hi> and <hi>Rabanus</hi> set it.</p>
               <p>These, we must confess, are things hard to be
understood, and never to be made out. They contain
in them unexplicable intricacies, and draw after them
innumerable absurdities. Such as quite overthrow
the truth of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Narrative, and so the Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of GOD himself. But therefore, as we see,
they are no parts of the Doctrine of Paradise.
That's entire without them, as Scripture delivers
it; which makes them neither Essentials, nor Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages
of it. They are but <gap reason="foreign">

<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>fine and noisy words,</hi> according
to <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> And they that first spake them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Persons of Fame, their Reputation gave credit
to what they said; and their great Authority draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others after them, they were followed by many,
though themselves went not in the right way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> Here is not the least touch, upon a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Aequinox,</hi> or a <hi>perpetual Spring;</hi> or the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulation,</hi>
or <hi>Growing</hi> of Animals out of the Earth;
which the <hi>Theory</hi> makes<note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 176.</note> Properties of Paradise.
Nor is there a Syllable spoken, of <hi>Adam</hi>'s being
formed at first on the other side of the World (that
is, in the Southern Hemisphere) and then of his
being transplanted hither. Nor is there any inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
that the <hi>Flaming Sword</hi> was the <hi>Torrid
Zone</hi> (as the <hi>Theory</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 257.</note> allows it to have been) but
rather something that suggests the contrary. For
Cherubim could no way be concerned in that; nor
could it well be said to be <hi>placed at the East of the
Garden of</hi> Eden, when it was placed round the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:102637:145"/>
Earth in way of Longitude. Nor do we hear a
word, of Rivers springing up on one side of the
Earth, and then shooting through it to the other
side, by deep and unintelligible trajections or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meations.
Thus a multitude of Difficulties would
be started; and such, as before we could run them
down, would lead us a weary, yea, an endless Chase.
But therefore these are no pieces of the true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Paradise. That's clear, and obvious, and
easie to be understood: at least as easie as the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory</hi>'s
Doctrine concerning it is. For say that Two
Branches of the Paradisiacal Stream, be somewhat
obscure; yet we need not fear but they will as soon
be set out to all Mens satisfaction; as the <hi>other two</hi>
so well known, together with <hi>Assyria,</hi> &amp;c. shall be
found in the Southern Hemisphere of the World, where,
according to the <hi>Theory,</hi> Paradise was situate. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when the upper Orb or Rim of the Earth
fell into the Abyss; and Rivers and Countries
were all jumbled together in unspeakable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
               <p>5. As for <hi>the Longaevity of the Antediluvians,</hi>
that could be no Property of Adjunct of Paradise
neither; inasmuch as the common Parents of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
were soon thrown out of it: and so the
length of <hi>their,</hi> or of their <hi>Childrens</hi> lives, could
not be owing to that State or Place, because none
of them lived and died therein. Indeed the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory</hi>
will have this <hi>Longaevity</hi> to be a <hi>Character</hi> of
the First Earth, as <hi>Paradisiacal:</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 189.</note> holds it was
<hi>common to good and bad, and lasted till the Deluge,</hi>
Mens <hi>houses of clay standing eight or nine hundred
years and upwards.</hi> And though I will not positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny this, That the People of the First World
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:102637:146"/>
did generally live to so wonderful an age (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a received opinion) yet give me leave to ask;
upon what good authority does it stand? The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Historians will hardly support it. For though
he tells of<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 5.</note> ten Men in a lineal descent that were
long livers; yet this will be no conclusive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that all were so. For <hi>they</hi> were excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and admirably useful upon several accounts.
Besides founding and improving of Learning and
Sciences; they were to instruct the World in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Goodness; to govern both in the Civil
(it may be) and Ecclesiastical capacity; To coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and propagate, as well as to defend the
True Religion; to take care of the Worship, and
promote the Kingdom and Interest of GOD; and
to shame the looseness, and reform or restrain the
lewdness of Men. And they being thus highly
useful and needful; no wonder they were continued
so long upon Earth. And thus we find <hi>Noah</hi> (it
being requisite still in some measure upon the same
accounts) living<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 9. 28, 29.</note> three hundred and fifty years
after the Flood, and reaching to nine hundred and
fifty in all. And also<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Shem, Arphaxad, Salah,</hi>
and <hi>Eber,</hi> living (for the same reasons) much
longer just after the Flood; than others did <hi>then,</hi>
or have done <hi>since.</hi> Though we may say, of their
long life, as <hi>Rabbi Levi</hi> (quoted by <hi>Genebrard</hi> in
the first of his <hi>Chronology</hi>) did of the <hi>Longaevity</hi> of
the Antediluvian Patriarchs, that it was <hi>opus Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiae,
non Naturae; the work of <hi>Providence,</hi> not of
Nature.</hi> Of such a miraculous providence as super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intended
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in the Wilderness, and caused
that their Cloaths by forty years wearing did not
wax old. And then if we grant some of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
stock, (of the impious Race of <hi>Cain</hi>) to have
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:102637:146"/>
lived as long (as the Ten Patriarchs before the
Flood, and perhaps some few others not mentioned)
by the same kind of Providence; for that they were
exceding eminent in their ways, for very laudable
and necessary things: (as <hi>Cain</hi> himself, for Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
and Architecture; <hi>Iabal,</hi> for Pasturage, and
the ordering of Cattle; <hi>Iubal,</hi> for Musick; <hi>Tubal-Cain,</hi>
for Mechanics, and the like:) Grant, I say,
but some of the degenerate Seed, of the worser sort
of Men, to have lived a great while for perfecting
the lower and lesser Arts: as some of the Holy
Seed and better sort did, for carrying on things of
an higher nature, and bigger concern: and possibly
the Prerogative of Longaevity, will be stretcht as
far, as by the sacred Records, it can upon <hi>certain</hi>
Grounds, be extended. And though the <hi>Theory</hi>
makes the Longaevity we speak of, common to all
the Antediluvians; yet in the Sequel of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it will appear, that even according to the <hi>Theory</hi>
it self, it could not be a general thing.</p>
               <p>But (in the mean time) if <hi>Divine Story</hi> proves
not such Longaevity common to the Antediluvians;
how shall <hi>other History</hi> do it? The <hi>Theorist</hi> cites
<hi>Iosephus</hi> as to this, and <hi>he</hi> brings in several Authors.
What he says of the long life of them before the
Deluge, I shall set down more fully than the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory</hi>
does.<note n="*" place="margin">Antiq. l. 1. c. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>They being beloved of GOD, and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
created by him, using also a kind of nourishment
agreeable to their nature, and proper to multiply their
years; it is no absurd thing to suppose that their years
were of that continuance: considering that GOD gave
them long life, to the end they should teach Vertue,
and should conveniently practise those things which they
had invented in</hi> Astronomy, <hi>and by</hi> Geometry; <hi>the
demonstrations whereof they never had attained,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:102637:147"/>
except they had lived at least six hundred years. For
the great year is accomplished by that number of
years: whereof all they bear me witness, who (either</hi>
Greeks <hi>or</hi> Barbarians) <hi>have written ancient Histories.
For both</hi> Manethon (<hi>who wrote the History of</hi>
Egypt) <hi>and</hi> Berosus (<hi>who registred the Acts and
Affairs of the</hi> Chaldeans) <hi>together with</hi> Molus,
Hestiaeus, <hi>and</hi> Hierom <hi>of</hi> Egypt (<hi>who give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the</hi> Phoenician Antiquities) <hi>accord with me
in that I have said.</hi> Hesiodus <hi>also,</hi> Heccataeus, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanicus,
<hi>and</hi> Acusilaus, Ephorus <hi>and</hi> Nicholaus <hi>do
declare, That they of the first World lived a thousand
years. But let every Man judge of these things as
he best liketh.</hi> Where (to let pass other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances)
let it be noted, that <hi>Iosephus</hi> attributes
long life, only to such as were <hi>beloved of GOD.</hi>
and that to such ends as were now specified;
that they might <hi>teach Vertue,</hi> and <hi>use and improve</hi>
Astronomy <hi>and</hi> Geometry, wherein they could have
attained to no considerable skill, without long life.
And then as to the rest of those Authors he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
how could <hi>they</hi> understand the thing better
than himself? For besides Scripture (which <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
was much better acquainted with than <hi>they</hi>)
what else could give them information in the case?
And therefore their account, we know, is utterly
false: for none of the first Worlds Ancients could
ever reckon a thousand years compleat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Only some
of them (in the sacred Register) came pretty near
it; though most fell short of it by such a Period of
time, as very few Lives comparatively now reach
to. And that <hi>Iosephus</hi> himself did not believe
that all lived so long, as the Writers cited by him
do mention; is plain from his shutting up the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted
Chapter, with an expression showing
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:102637:147"/>
diffidence in himself, by allowing it to others. <hi>Let
every Man judge of these things as he thinks best.</hi>
Which I desire may be noted the rather, because
there are few that write for this Longaevity of the
Prediluvians; but they still quote this place in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus,</hi>
and back what they say, with the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
he brings. Yet we see, he is so far from
being <hi>positive,</hi> in the matter, that he leaves People
wholly to their own judgments about it. And as
for Scripture, I say, he read and understood it as
well as others; and could he have found good
proofs of the Point there, he would doubtless have
spoken more definitively of it. And the truth is,
Scripture says not one word of <hi>Cain</hi>'s, or his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
living eight or nine hundred years. And
therefore when we granted they might do so, it
was no absolutely necessary Concession. But this
is observable, that the Invention of <hi>Manual</hi> Arts,
and such things as might be carried on to good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Perfection in a less of space of time; fell to
<hi>their</hi> care and management. Whereas (according
to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Historian) <hi>Astronomy,</hi> and <hi>Geometry,</hi>
which could not be learnt but in longer Periods,
were studied by those <hi>Virtuoso's,</hi> who are upon Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Record for <hi>long-livers.</hi> Which tacitly intimates
that the <hi>reason</hi> of long life, and so <hi>long life</hi> it self,
was not common to <hi>all.</hi> And though <hi>Moses</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
a few by name that lived so very long;
yet this no more proves that <hi>all</hi> attained to the like
age, before the Flood; than his saying<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 6. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>there were
Giants on the Earth in those days,</hi> does imply the
whole Race of Mankind were such. Yea, as his
telling the World, there were some Giants <hi>then,</hi> does
import that the rest were otherwise: so his mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> so very long livers, may insinuate that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:102637:148"/>
the rest were not so. Nor do we stand quite alone
in this Opinion; For <hi>Rabbi Moses</hi> in his Book <hi>de
directione perplexorum,</hi> as <hi>Burgensis</hi> cites him <hi>(Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</hi>
1. in <hi>Gen. 5. apud</hi> Lyr.) was of the same
mind. And as he attributes length of life before
the Flood, <hi>miraculo divino, to divine miracle;</hi> so he
says, <hi>diuturnitas fuit solùm in illis qui in sacra
Scriptura nominantur, scilicet</hi> Adam, Seth, Enos,
<hi>&amp;c. non autem in aliis contemporaneis, qui non tam
diuturnè vivebant; sed sicut past diluvium. Length
of life was only in those, who are named in the Holy
Scripture; that is to say,</hi> Adam, Seth, Enos, <hi>&amp;c.
but not in others their contemporaries; who did not
live so long; but as</hi> Men lived <hi>after the Deluge.
Burgensis</hi> himself also (first, a most learned <hi>Iew</hi>
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and then a famous <hi>Christian</hi> Doctor)
seems to be of the same judgment with the <hi>Rabbi,</hi>
in this matter.</p>
               <p>But if at last it be urged, that the Authors
aforesaid are too many and considerable, to have
their Testimonies questioned or rejected; and that
what they delivered of the Praediluvians Longaevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
must be true of them in <hi>general,</hi> they receiving
the thing by authentic <hi>Tradition:</hi> let it be yielded.
But then I must demand, and may be allowed to
do so; How comes it to pass that <hi>Tradition</hi> is so
<hi>partial,</hi> and not equally faithful as to other great
concerns of the first World? Particularly, why does
it not by the Pen of the same, or of other Writers,
tell us explicitly of a <hi>constant Aequinox,</hi> and a
<hi>perpetual Spring,</hi> as <hi>Causes</hi> of that Longaevity? and
not leave it to be imputed to <hi>nourishment</hi> and higher
things; whither <hi>Iosephus,</hi> we see, ascribes it. Why
does it not tell us of a Sky without Clouds; and
an Heaven without Rains; and an Earth without
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:102637:148"/>
Seas, and Mountains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Surely if <hi>Tradition</hi>
spake so loud in <hi>one</hi> case; and was so dumb or
deeply silent in the <hi>rest:</hi> this seems to evidence,
that however there might be somewhat of truth
in that <hi>one Phaenomenon;</hi> there was none in the
other.</p>
               <p>6. Though truly that all the Prediluvians were
such long livers, cannot well be supposed for this
reason. Because then their Multitudes would have
everlaid the Earth, and they would have wanted
room wherein to subsist. For grant them to have
multiplied but as Mankind did just after the Flood,
or as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or
even as People do now adays; and where would
there have been place convenient for them? And
yet that they did increase at such a rate, and faster
too, is but reasonable to think; in regard humane
Nature if ever it were stronger at any time than
other, was so at first. To which add, that <hi>Diga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
was in use before the Flood: and <hi>Lamech</hi> (one
who was infamous for it) is said by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> to
have had seventy seven Children by his two
Wives. Yea, perhaps Men were not only for
<hi>two,</hi> but <hi>many</hi> Wives, <hi>Genesis</hi> 6. 2. and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamy
must contribute greatly to the encrease of
Mankind.</p>
               <p>But there needs no farther Prosecution of this.
The <hi>Theory</hi> yields as much as we contend for, or
can desire in the Case: Though no more than what
may be true, and so inavoidable.<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>'Tis likely they
were more fruitful in the first Ages of the World,
than after the Flood; and they lived six, seven, eight,
nine hundred years apiece, getting Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
And again;<note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>If we allow the first Couple at
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:102637:149"/>
the end of one hundred years, or of the first Century,
to have left ten pair of Breeders, which is <hi>an easie
supposition,</hi> there would arise from these in fifteen
hundred years, <hi>a greater number than the Earth
was capable of;</hi> allowing every pair to multiply in
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> same decuple proportion the first Pair did.</hi> So
that if a <hi>Supposition</hi> (which (in the <hi>Theorist</hi>'s own
judgment) is <hi>easie,</hi> may be but admitted (as why
should it not?) either the Longaevity of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tediluvians
must not be <hi>universal,</hi> or the Earth
was <hi>incapable</hi> of the <hi>number</hi> of its Inhabitants.
Nor could the Primitive Earth receive greater
numbers of People than this. For grant it had no
open Seas in it; yet the <hi>Middle</hi> Regions of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uninhabitable in regard of heat; and the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
ones upon account of Wet and Cold: both
will be reduced to a pretty equal capaciousness.
And should it be alleg'd, that the first Earth was
bigger in Circumference, than this is; that will
be made good, by casting in on the present Earth's
side, the sinking hollownesses and declivities of
Valleys; and the swelling protuberancies and gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosities
of Mountains; neither of which the first
Earth had.</p>
               <p>Farther, if People before the Flood, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
so long-liv'd, and this their Longaevity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from a perpetual Aequinox, and settled
benign temperature of the Air, as the <hi>Theory</hi> holds;
then surely there would not have been that <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
as to length of days amongst them, as we
find there was. Thus, <hi>Lamech</hi>'s Age (as
appears in the<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 5.</note> Catalogue of long livers) was
short of <hi>Mathuselah</hi>'s, near two hundred years.
Whereas if the Cause of long life had been so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and steddy a thing, and so generally and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:102637:149"/>
equally influential upon all, as the supposed Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox;
the Effect would have answered it: Longae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
it self would have been more regular, and not
have admitted of so much disparity. Though the
truth is, such an Aequinox, and such an Earth as
we have heard of, would rather help to shorten
life (we may think) than draw it out to such a
length. For certain it is, that they must shut all
Winds and Storms, and Clouds and Rains, and
Thunders and Lightnings, out of the First World.
And what are these but <hi>Crises</hi> of Nature, wherein
those malignities and noxious qualities which are
lodged in her, and would corrupt her; suffer a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
and are discharged? just as morbific humors
in the Body, first ferment, and then are thrown off
by proper Evacuations. But when there could be
no Storms or Thunders, to put the Air into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to purge and clarifie it, that so it might
continue pure and wholsome: it being always calm
and too quiescent (like stagnant Water) must
needs putrifie, and contract such foulness as would
make it unhealthy, and apt to cause grievous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
and Death. <hi>Egypt</hi> is almost in the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
state of the Primitive Earth. Situate between
the second and fifth Climates; its longest day not
above thirteen hours and an half; has seldom any
Rain, but is watered by a River. Yet how sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is <hi>Cairo</hi> to raging Plagues, and where are
greater or oftener Mortalities than there?</p>
               <p>I have only this to add here. If the Aequinox
spoken of, were the cause of a <hi>general</hi> Longaevity
in the Prediluvian World; then other Animals
would have lived as long proportionably, as
Men. That is to say Lions, Bears, Wolves, Dogs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And these multiplying five or six times (to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:102637:150"/>
say no more) as fast as Men; might have soon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
and destroyed them. Also Rats, Mice,
Fowls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> multiplying (in that World) all the
year round, and in far greater numbers than the
Creatures aforesaid; would have destroyed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
another way: not by devouring <hi>them,</hi> but the
<hi>Fruits</hi> of the Earth which they were to live upon.
Especially when Men lived wholly on such Fruits
(without eating Flesh) and had no such ways and
instruments at first, of killing those Vermin, as now
they have.</p>
               <p>Nor did the Earth yield such plenty of Corn of
its own accord, as to satisfie all granivorous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
without preying upon Mens Corps. For
upon Man's sin,<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 3. 17.</note> the ground was cursed. And
upon that Malediction, it afforded not Corn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Tillage. For thence forward even <hi>Adam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

               <p>1. LET us now go on to the next <hi>Vital</hi> or
<hi>Primary Assertion</hi> of the <hi>Theory,</hi> which is
this.<note place="margin">Read the <hi>Sixth Chapter</hi> of the <hi>first Book</hi> of the <hi>English Theory.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The Disruption and Fall of the Earth into the
Abyss which lay under it, was that which made the
Vniversal Deluge, and the Destruction of the old
World.</hi> For the vehement and piercing heat of the
Sun, having parched and chapped the exterior
Orb of Earth, and so greatly weakned it: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
having raised great store of Vapours out of the
Deep within this Orb; their force at length grew to
be such, that the Walls inclosing them being unable
to hold them, the whole Fabric brake, being torn
in pieces as it were with an Earthquake. At
which time, the Fragments of that Orb of Earth,
of several sizes, plunging into the Abyss in several
Postures; by their weight, and greatness, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
descent, caused such a rageing Tumult in the
Waters, and put them into so fierce Commotions
and furious Agitations, as made them boil and flow
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:102637:151"/>
up above the tops of the new made Mountains; and
so caused the general Deluge. But against this we
<hi>Except</hi> also, and say that the Flood could not be thus
effected, for several reasons.</p>
               <p>2. First, Because it would be inconsistent with
<hi>Moses</hi>'s Description of Paradise. What that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
is, we have seen already; and 'tis done
according to the proper Rules of <hi>Topography.</hi> For
first, he marks it out by its <hi>Quality;</hi> a <hi>Garden.</hi>
Then by its <hi>name; Eden.</hi> Then by its <hi>Situation;
Eastward.</hi> Then by its <hi>Inhabitant; Man.</hi> Then
by its <hi>Furniture; every Tree pleasant to the sight,
and good for Food.</hi> And lastly, by a <hi>River</hi> to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it, which (rising <hi>in</hi> it, or running <hi>through,</hi> or
<hi>by</hi> it) did divide its stream into four Heads or
Branches: all which, except one, are made to refer
to some <hi>Country</hi> or other. Thus, <hi>Pison</hi> is said to
compass the Land of <hi>Havilah: Gihon,</hi> the Land
of <hi>Cush,</hi> or the <hi>Asian Aethiopia: Hiddekel,</hi> to run
towards the East of <hi>Assyria.</hi> But had the Earth
been dissolved to make the Flood; how could these
Rivers, or how could these Countries, or any of
either of them, exist in <hi>Moses</hi>'s time; as being all
swallowed up and for ever perisht in the fall of the
Earth? And yet if they were not in being <hi>then,</hi>
how could he describe the Terrestrial Paradise by
them, as he does? And yet that they could have
no being then, the <hi>Theory</hi> acknowledges in these
words.<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 25<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>'Tis true, if you admit our</hi> Hypothesis,
<hi>concerning the fraction and disruption of the Earth
at the Deluge, then we cannot expect to find Rivers
now as they were before—their chanels are all
broke up.</hi> But then if the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the <hi>Theory</hi>
were true, what meant <hi>Moses</hi> to put these Rivers,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:102637:152"/>
or any part of them, or any Countries near them,
into the Topography of Paradise; when together
with the Earth, they were all broke up and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
so long before?</p>
               <p>To make the Argument as short as may be.
In case these Rivers were <hi>not</hi> in the first World,
it was impossible Paradise should be described by
them. And if they <hi>were</hi> in <hi>that</hi> World, it was as
impossible they should be in <hi>this.</hi> And so we have
good evidence, that the general Flood could not be
the Effect of the Earth's Dissolution. For if it
were so, <hi>Moses</hi>'s Description of Paradise must be
false. Which, to affirm, would be horrid Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
it being dictated by the HOLY
GHOST.</p>
               <p>Nor will it mend the matter here, to fall to <hi>Cabbalizing,</hi>
or Expounding things <hi>Mystically.</hi> So we shall run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same Rock, and put hideous affront upon the
Truth of GOD, by turning it into meer Figure
and Falshood. Two eminent Fathers subscribe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
to this. The first, <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> whose words
are these. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>If</hi>

how empty, and shallow, and extreamly trifling

                  <hi>Let no such impiety invade our
reason,</hi> says he, <hi>as to suppose that
GOD tills the ground or plants a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise;
inasmuch as we might presently
doubt why he should do it. For he
could never thereby furnish himself with
pleasant Mansions, Retirements, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights;
nor could such a fabulosity ever
enter into our mind. For the whole
World could not be a worthy place or
habitation for GOD; who indeed is a
place to himself, and is full of, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for himself.</hi> Where the reason
why there must be <hi>no Material</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
and why it is <hi>impious</hi> for us to
think that GOD planted one; is, because it
would not be gratifying to him, and because the
whole World is not a fit habitation for him.
(And therefore by the same reason there never was
a World made neither.) As if Paradise had not been
planted for <hi>Man,</hi> but GOD. And<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de Plant. No.</note> elsewhere we
find him harping upon the same string, though it
sounds but harshly. To take the Paradise planted
by GOD, for a Garden of <hi>Vines,</hi> and <hi>Olives, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Pomgranates, and the like Trees, would be a
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:102637:153"/>
gross and incurable folly.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.
<hi>For one might say; To what end was it? for a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
dwelling place? But then might not the whole
World be thought the most contentful dwelling for
GOD the Vniversal King?</hi> And a little after;
<hi>Truly as GOD does not at all want other things, so
neither</hi> (Fruits for) <hi>nourishment.</hi> Where the main
reason against a <hi>Local</hi> Paradise again, is (that which
really is none) its <hi>Vselessness</hi> in reference to GOD.
As if the design or end of a Paradise, had been to
supply the necessities or conveniencies of the DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ITY:
and because GOD did not need it, and
could receive no benefit by it; therefore it must be
<hi>folly</hi> to think he planted it. But what was it that
made so learned a Man to argue thus?</p>
               <p>3. Secondly, The Dissolution of the Earth could
not be the Cause of the general Flood; because it
would have utterly destroyed <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, and all
that were in it. For then that great and heavy
Vessel, sinking with the Ground whereon it stood;
must certainly have been staved all to pieces, if not
overwhelm'd in the Ruines of the Earth. I know
that in favour of this Ark, and for its Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
it is supposed that the<note n="*" place="margin">Theor. pag. 98.</note> Abyss was not
broken open till after the forty days Rain; and
that those Rain-waters <hi>might set it a-float,</hi> and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
its ruinous Fall, by <hi>keeping it from that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
shock, which it would have had if it had stood
upon dry land when the Earth fell.</hi> But this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
was noted above to be false, and must needs
be so. For by the infallible Records we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
That the Fountains of the great Deep were
broke up, and the Windows of Heaven opened in
the <hi>same day,</hi> Gen. 7. 11. Yea, according to the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:102637:153"/>
order of the Holy Words (if there be any Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in those two Causes of the Deluge) the
Disruption of the Abyss should precede; the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
open of the Fountains being <hi>first</hi> mention'd.
And so the Ark having no Water to Float on, must
certainly have stood upon dry ground when the
Earth fell. And consequently <hi>the impetuous shock</hi>
spoken of, could by no means have been avoided;
but must certainly have destroy'd the Ark, and all
Creatures in it.</p>
               <p>4. Thirdly, Had the Deluge been caused by the
Earth's Dissolution, the Earth (or dry Land of
this Terraqueous Globe) would in <hi>likelihood</hi> have
been of another Figure than what now it bears.
For under the <hi>Ecliptic</hi> (which in the Primitive Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of the Earth (according to the <hi>Theory</hi>)
was its Aequinoctial; and divided the Globe into two
Hemispheres, as the Aequator does now) the dry
ground is of <hi>most</hi> spatious extent and continuity.
Even from the South-west parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> about
<hi>Guinea;</hi> there is one entire Tract of <hi>firm Land,</hi>
reaching as far as the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf, and the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi>
Sea. That is, for the length of Seventy five
Degrees, or between four and five thousand Miles.
And then Eastward of that Sea, runs the main
Land of <hi>India;</hi> which from the Western parts of
it, to <hi>Camboia.</hi> in the East, is extended between
two and three thousand Miles more. And yet it
is all-a-long one continued Tract of Land, bating
the <hi>Sinus Gangeticus,</hi> or Gulf of <hi>Bengala;</hi> which
North-wards thrusts up but a little beyond the
<hi>Ecliptic</hi> neither. And lastly, the same <hi>Ecliptic</hi>
runs obliquely over almost the widest part of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica
Peruana;</hi> another piece of Ground three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:102637:154"/>
Miles in breadth. So that the Earth seems
to be too whole in its Aequinoctial Regions (I
mean those that were so before the Flood) to have
been dissolved to make the Deluge. For had it
suffered such a dissolution; the <hi>middle parts</hi> of it
falling in <hi>first</hi> (for some reasions<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 9. Parag. 4.</note> before suggested)
it seems probable that it should have been more
broken and shattered thereabouts than any where
else; if not clean swallowed up: and so the Earth
must have been of quite another shape than now
it is. But this I speak as a probable, rather than
as a certain thing. Where grounds are but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive
and conjectural; Assertions built upon them,
must not be positive and dogmatical.</p>
               <p>5. Fourthly, Had the Earth been dissolved to
make the Flood; its Dissolution would have brought
it into a state of most lamentable barrenness. For
then the inward parts of it being turned outward;
and the starven Molds, and stony Materials in its
Bowels, being made into its surface in a great
measure: in all such places, it would not only have
been destitute of such things, as should have afforded
nourishment both to Men and Beasts; but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
indisposed <hi>to,</hi> and incapable <hi>of</hi> yielding them,
for a long time. The Husbandman when he plows
a little deeper than ordinary, and fetches up the <hi>dead
Soil,</hi> as he terms it; it proves a great hindrance to
his Crops. Yet what is <hi>that</hi> Soil, but part of what
(upon the exterior Orb's tumbling into the Abyss)
must have been turned up by whole Countries at
once? at least in the Aequinoctial parts of the
Earth, as being extreamly dried, and having all the
heart or fatness suck'd out of it, by the scorching
Sun. And where vast pieces of Earth sank whole
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:102637:154"/>
as they were, and the ground also was of a richer
nature (as retaining, we'll suppose, some of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Oiliness) yet <hi>there</hi> it must have been covered with
an huge quantity of Mud, which would have made
it barren by choking such things as would have
grown upon it. For the Waters below, being by
the falling in of the Ground, expell'd from their
aboad, and forced to fly up with unspeakable vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence;
and then by reason of their plenty and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
descending with as much rage and force again;
and still as the Earth suffered more fractures, and
plung'd into the Waters in more pieces, they feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
new commotions, and being huffed up and
put into fresh estuations: by their rising and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and working and beating furiously and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly;
they must needs wash and wear off a
mighty deal of Earth from the fragments that drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
into the Deep. Which Earth being carried
into all places, by the tossing, rolling, turbulent
Waters, and spread pretty thick upon the face of
the Ground; and also incorporate with much other
Filth; it could not but be occasion of great bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness
to the Earth. For then when the Deluge
settled and went off, that Filth could not but
harden into a crust or cap upon the Earth's sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
very destructive to the Earth's fruitfulness.
Especially if we consider, how long and dismally
the Ground was harrass'd by the Flood, before it
was incrusted. For, says the <hi>Theory,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 76.</note> 
                  <hi>the Tumult
of the Waters, and the extremity of the Deluge lasted
for some Months.</hi> And the fluctuations of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being so boisterous, and withal so lasting,
they could not but wash up, or kill most of the
tenderer sort of Plants, and many of the hardier and
stronger ones too; yea, and perhaps rinse off the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:102637:155"/>
top of the ground it self, leaving it generally bare,
and covering it in many places with store of silty,
sandy, or gravelly stuff. So that the Earth being
first made bare, and then overgrown with the
Crust aforesaid (which with the Sun and Wind
would be baked on to it, and wax pretty stiff and
hard about it) how could it at first have afforded
sustenance to the living Creatures? And therefore
we read concerning.<note n="†" place="margin">See Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi>'s Hist. Book 1. c. 8. §. 11. † 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Attica,</hi> That <hi>by reason of
Mud and Slime which the Waters lest upon the Earth,
it was uninhabited two hundred years after</hi> Ogyges's
<hi>Flood.</hi> And that the whole Earth should be
in as bad a Condition after the general Flood; as
<hi>Attica</hi> was after that Inundation which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it; we need not question, if the <hi>Theory</hi> has
hit upon the true Cause of the Deluge. So that
however <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family might have made
shift for Food (supporting themselves by eating
some of those Creatures kept alive in the Ark,
which GOD (at their going out of the same)
gave them for meat, with a general Licence to
eat Flesh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 3.) yet other Animals, for a
time, would have been at a very great loss for Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Again, had the Earth been drowned, by its
being dissolved and falling into the Abyss;</hi> all the
Buildings erected before the Flood, would have been
shaken down, or else overwhelmed. <hi>Yet we read of
some that outstood the Flood, and were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molisht.
Such were the Pillars of</hi> Seth, <hi>and the
Cities</hi> Henochia, <hi>and</hi> Ioppa. <hi>Touching which (to
avoid quoting of several Authors) I shall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
what I meet with in</hi>

is also avowed by <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> (to whom I give
more credit in these things) that the City of <hi>Jopa</hi>
was built before the Flood, over which <hi>Cephas</hi> was
King: whose name, with his Brother <hi>Phineas,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the grounds and principles of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
was found graven upon certain Altars of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:102637:156"/>
Stone. And it is not impossible that the ruines of
the other City, called <hi>Enoch,</hi> by <hi>Annius,</hi> might be
seen, though founded in the first Age. <hi>Solinus</hi> also
witnesseth concerning <hi>Joppa,</hi> that it <hi>was</hi> oppidum an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquissimum
orbe toto, utpote ante inundationem ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum
conditum; the most ancient Town in the whole
World, as being built before the Flood upon the
Earth.</p>
               <p>Now if things were thus; that is to say, if a
Pillar of <hi>Seth</hi>'s erecting (whereon was<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Joseph.</hi> Ant. l. 1. c. 3.</note> ingraved
the rules of Science) was standing after the Flood,
in the Country of <hi>Lycia:</hi> If the City <hi>Enoch</hi>
was so far from being ruined by the Deluge, that
it was not defaced: If <hi>Ioppa</hi> was so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
swallowed up or made an heap of Rubbish,
that the Altars in it were plainly discernible,
and standing in such order, that the Inscriptions
upon them were legible: then most certainly the
Earth's Dissolution, and Fall into the Deep, could
not cause the Flood. For them, suppose that the
Ground had fallen but a Mile, or a Mile and a
quarter downward; which we must grant it did at
least (according to the heighth of the present
Mountains, set at ten Furlongs, when carefully

given such a terrible jar or jounce, as would have
shattered the abovesaid Structures all down, and
laid them flat upon the Earth, if not sunk them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>

                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:102637:156"/>
And that which would have made it more difficult
for them to have continued standing, was their Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For <hi>Enoch</hi> is said to be built <hi>about the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of</hi> Libanus. But then about the Mountains the
Waters would have been most irresistably violent,
had the Flood proceeded from the Earth's Dissolution.
So we are assured by the <hi>Theory.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 75.</note> 
                  <hi>The pressure of
a great mass of Earth falling into the Abyss—
could not but impel the Water with so much strength,
as would carry it up to a great height in the Air;
and to the top of any thing that lay in its way, any
eminency or high fragment whatsoever: and then rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back again, it would sweep down with it whatsoever
it rusht upon, Woods, Buildings, Living-creatures, and
carry them all headlong into the great Gulf.</hi> So that
<hi>Enoch</hi> being situate about the Mountain <hi>Libanus,</hi> the
very force of the Waters alone perhaps might have
born it down. And then as to <hi>Ioppa,</hi> I have some
where read, That it is <hi>oppidum monte situm</hi> too, a
Town situate on an Hill. Or if it be not, for certain it
stands just upon the brink of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea:
and so could never have escaped being overturn'd.
For besides that it must have been shaken with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
fall of the Ground; it was placed just where the
mighty Fragment, which dived into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi>
or made the bottom of it, was riven off; and so at the
time of its hideous splitting off, the poor City must
needs have suffered a very dismal Concussion. And
the like may be said, in a good measure, of the Pillar
of <hi>Seth,</hi> it standing not far from the Sea neither.</p>
               <p>I know the very <hi>Being</hi> is questioned of <hi>Seth</hi>'s Pillar,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what some doubt, others believe: and having
<hi>all Antiquity</hi> (as the cited Historian says) on our side;
we have ventured to put in this piece of Exception
among others. <hi>Valeat quantum valere potest.</hi>

7. Lastly, Had the Dissolution of the Earth, been
the Cause of the Deluge; <hi>it would have made GOD's
Covenant with</hi> Noah, <hi>a very vain and trifling thing.</hi>
Soon after the Flood was dried up, it pleased the great
GOD to make an explicit and gracious Covenant
with that Patriarch himself, and his Children; and in
behalf of all Living Creatures then in being, or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to exist; that the World should be drown'd
no more with such a general Deluge. And this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
he was pleased to ratifie with a remarkable
Sign, that of the Rainbow; which was to be a last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
token of remembrance to HIM, as well as
a Pledge of assurance to <hi>us.</hi> So we find <hi>Gen.</hi> 9 from
the 8<hi>th verse,</hi> to the 17<hi>th. And GOD spake unto
Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, And I, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
I establish my covenant with you, and with your
seed after you: and with every living creature that is
with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast
of the earth with you, from all that go out of the
Ark, to every beast of the earth. And I will establish
my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off
any more, by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> waters of a flood, neither shall there
any more be a flood to destroy the earth. And
GOD said, This is the token of the covenant
which I make between me and you, and every living
creature which is with you, for perpetual generations.
I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a
token of a covenant between me and the earth. And
it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the
earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud. And I
will remember my covenant, which is between me and you,
and every living creature of all flesh: and the water
shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And
the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:102637:157"/>
that I may remember the evelasting covenant between
GOD and every living creature, of all flesh that is
upon the earth. And GOD said unto Noah, This
is the token of the covenant, which I have established
between me and all flesh, that is upon the earth.</hi> Now
if the Earth had been drowned the <hi>Theory</hi>'s way, what
need of all this? Then it had been but GOD's telling
<hi>Noah,</hi> how the Flood came; and that would have
made him, and all his Posterity, both sensible and
secure enough at once, that such <hi>another</hi> Flood could
never happen. Yea, <hi>that</hi> scarce need to have been
told him neither; inasmuch as the thing would have
been throughly apparent, to them that lived in both
the Worlds, from the great changes they must have
observed: and so the Covenant would have been vain
and useless. Yea, which is worse, it would have been
perfect Mockery and Collusion; because then the
Earth could not have been capable <hi>of,</hi> or liable <hi>to,</hi>
such another Deluge. So that GOD's covenanting
not to drown it any more; would have been as if he
should have covenanted that a thing impossible should
not be done: that the Fire should not freeze, or
the Sun shine darkness. For as neither Sun nor Fire
can do such things, so long as they continue what
they are; no more could the Earth be drowned a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, so long as it continued a <hi>dissolved</hi> Earth.
Yet that it <hi>may</hi> be delug'd again, is clear from GOD's
<hi>covenanting</hi> that it shall not, and from the <hi>Terms</hi> of
that Covenant. For the <hi>Bow</hi> in the Cloud is said to
be a <hi>Token <hi>of the Covenant.</hi>
                  </hi> And that when <hi>that</hi>
Bow is <hi>seen, GOD will <hi>remember</hi> his Covenant.</hi>
And that he <hi>will look upon it,</hi> to that very end, <hi>that
he <hi>may remember</hi> the everlasting Covenant.</hi> Plainly
intimating, that if that Covenant were not made;
or being made, if by GOD it were not remembred;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:102637:158"/>
the Earth might again be drowned, with as universal
and fatal a Flood as ever. But then if it <hi>may</hi> be so,
from thence it will follow, that <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood could
not be caused by the Earth's Dissolution. Because
then Nature could no longer have been subject to a
second Deluge, and GOD need not have covenanted
to prevent it; His very doing it must have been a kind
of imposing upon Men, as being but an ingaging to
save them from an impossible evil; and to keep that
sad Calamity off them, which nothing but miracle or
his own Omnipotence was able to bring on. So that
in fine, the case is come to this issue; Either that the
Glorious GOD has done mighty unworthily (pardon
the word) in making a Covenant, which has nothing
but vanity and mockage in it; or else that the <hi>Theory</hi>
determines falsely, in making the Deluge to flow from
the Dissolution and Falling in of the Earth.</p>

               <p>1. WE are now come to the last <hi>Vital,</hi> or <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Assertion</hi> of the <hi>Theory,</hi> which is
this, <hi>That neither</hi> Noah's <hi>Flood, nor the present Form
of the Earth, can be explained in any other method
that is rational, nor by any other Causes that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</hi>
That is, besides those which the <hi>Theory</hi> makes
use of, or assigns. Now as to the present Form of
the Earth, we have spoken something to that already.
So that could but such an Explication of the Flood
be given in, as would solve it, and the several <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena's</hi>
of it, as <hi>rationally</hi> and <hi>intelligibly</hi> as the
<hi>Theory</hi> does; <hi>this</hi> Assertion likewise would be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
encountred in our way of <hi>Excepting</hi> against
it. Let us therefore be allowed but <hi>some</hi> of that
liberty which the <hi>Theory</hi> takes; that is, to make
bold with Scripture a <hi>little,</hi> as <hi>that</hi> has done <hi>a great
deal;</hi> and we'll try what may be done of this
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:102637:159"/>
nature. Not that I will be bound to defend what I say, as
real and true; any more than to believe (what I
cannot well endure to speak) that the Church of
GOD has ever gone on in an irrational way of
explaining the Deluge. Which yet she must needs
have done, if there be no other <hi>rational method</hi> of
explaining it, and no other <hi>intelligible Causes</hi> of it,
than what the <hi>Theory</hi> has proposed.</p>
               <p>2. We are now therefore attempting or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oving at
a <hi>New Explication</hi> of the Flood. And if in any
thing it seems strange, let none wonder or be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at it. We are only trying whether we
can hit upon somewhat, that may be as rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
and intelligible as to the matter in hand, as
what the <hi>Theory</hi> offers; though it be as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
as that is. So that where we speak never
so positively, still what we deliver, is to be
lookt upon, not as an <hi>Absolute,</hi> but <hi>Comparative</hi>
Hypothesis.</p>
               <p>And first let us sound the Waters of the Flood.
I mean by a true and infallible Plumb-line; even
the same which <hi>Moses</hi> reaches out unto us, in
the Seventh of <hi>Genesis.</hi> So we shall find there is
a great mistake in the common <hi>Hypothesis</hi> touching
their Depth. For whereas they have been sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
to be fifteen Cubits higher than the highest
Mountains; they were indeed but <hi>fifteen Cubits
high</hi> in all, above the surface of the Earth. Not that
the Waters were no where higher than just fifteen
Cubits above the Ground: they might in most
places be thirty, forty, or fifty Cubits high or
higher. The reason is evident; because the surface
of the Earth, were all its Hills gone, would be still
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>even, and some parts of it considerably higher
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:102637:159"/>
than others. Thus,<note n="*" place="margin">Some think <hi>Italy</hi> the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; because the ascent up the <hi>Alpes</hi> is very great on the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> side; but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent on the <hi>Italian</hi> side, inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> 
                  <hi>Helvetia</hi> is reckoned the
highest Country in <hi>Europe.</hi> And in proof of as
much, it sends forth four great Rivers into the four
several Quarters of the <hi>Europian</hi> World. That is
to say, the <hi>Danube,</hi> Eastward; the <hi>Rosne,</hi> Westward;
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> Northward; and the <hi>Po,</hi> Southward.
For though the Earth be a Globe, yet it is not one
so true and exact, but were the Mountains taken
off it, I say, it would still be rising or prominent
in some places by the height of many Cubits,
over what it is in others. At which rate, when
the Flood ascended <hi>fifteen Cubits</hi> above the Earth
where it is highest (which was the true height of
the Flood) most of the surface of the Earth might
be four or five times as deep under water. Thus,
when <hi>Switzerland</hi> (suppose) was drowned to the
height of <hi>fifteen Cubits;</hi> most of <hi>Europe</hi> might be
drowned many times as high. And indeed that the
Earth was uneven (as we have said) and much
higher in some places than in others; cannot be
doubted: it being but a wise and most necessary
piece of Providence, that it should be so contrived.
For otherwise spacious plain Countries (if habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
at all) would have yielded but incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Dwellings. I mean, because they must have
been perfectly level, and so would have lacked
devexities needful for Water-courses. For Rivers,
we know, never flow but in way of <hi>decurse</hi> or
running downward, off precipices, steepnesses, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivities.</p>
               <p>3. This therefore we lay down as the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that the <hi>highest</hi> parts of the
Earth, that is, of the <hi>common surface</hi> of it, were
under Water but <hi>fifteen Cubits</hi> in depth: which
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:102637:160"/>
would drown the rest of its superficies, very sadly
and sufficiently. And this, I say, we learn from
<hi>Moses;</hi> who knowing it himself by Inspiration, to
inform us of as much, has committed it to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
in the Seventh Chapter of <hi>Genesis.</hi> For there
we read at the eighteenth <hi>Verse,</hi> That <hi>the waters
prevailed greatly upon the earth.</hi> And at the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<hi>Verse,</hi> that <hi>the waters prevailed exceedingly upon
the earth.</hi> And how <hi>greatly</hi> and <hi>exceedingly</hi> did
they prevail upon the Earth? <hi>That</hi> we have specified
in the twentieth <hi>ver. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>fifteen Cubits</hi> upward did the waters prevail.</hi> What
can be more clear or express? They prevailed
<hi>fifteen Cubits</hi> and no more. Fifteen Cubits <hi>upward;</hi>
that is, upon the Earth. Upon which they are
said to prevail <hi>greatly,</hi> and to prevail <hi>exceedingly</hi> (in
the two foregoing Verses) that is upon the highest
parts of its common surface.</p>
               <p>And thus our <hi>Supposition</hi> stands supported by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority, as being founded upon Scripture.
<hi>That</hi> tells us, as plainly as it can speak, that the
Waters prevailed but <hi>fifteen Cubits</hi> upon the Earth.
(The cited Text, as a certain Plumb-line, shows
them to have been no deeper, where the Earth
bosoms out, and is most prominent.) And so it puts
an useful key into our hands, to help us to unlock
the mystery of the Deluge, and to free the Doctrine
of it from great difficulties and inconveniencies;
which have run Men, it seems, upon <hi>irrational</hi>
and <hi>unintelligible</hi> means and methods of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
               <p>4. Before we lay down any other Arguments in
confirmation of the <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> let us try if the
light of Scripture, which shows the <hi>Depth</hi> of the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:102637:160"/>
Flood so plainly, will not also discover to us more
clearly than yet has been done, what those <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the great Deep</hi> were, which at the time of
the Flood were <hi>cleaved,</hi> or<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 7. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>broken up.</hi> And truly
this it seems to do very notably; giving us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that they were but certain <hi>Caverns.</hi> Such
Caverns, I mean, as were contained in Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
And so the breaking up of the Fountains of
<hi>Tehom Rabbah,</hi> or <hi>the great Deep,</hi> (which the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory</hi>
insists so much upon) was no more than the
breaking up of such <hi>Caverns.</hi> This is evident from

that place in the 78<hi>th Psalm,</hi> does not only observe,
that GOD made the Waters to descend, <hi>ex petra
praeeminente, out of a very high Rock;</hi> but also
notes the reason why he did so, <hi>ut origo aquarum

appear to all.</hi> We cannot but remember likewise,
that this water is said, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. to follow the
<hi>Israelites.</hi> Which speaks it to have had a fall from
an <hi>elevated</hi> Situation. And indeed if it had not, it
could not so well have run along with their Camp
perhaps to <hi>Cadesh,</hi> where we next find them at a
want for Water. Though if the Rock in <hi>Rephidim</hi>
did supply them all-a-long in their intermediate
marches and stages; we must needs conclude there
were extraordinary accessions of Water into the
<hi>great Deeps,</hi> or Caverns of it; out of which it
flowed with so very plentiful and lasting Streams.
The least that can be imagined, is, That they were
so framed as to draw abundance of Vapours into
themselves; which being dissolved in the Vaults with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
from thence gushed out in a continued Torrent.
Not unlike to the Waters in <hi>Tenariff,</hi> which every
day pour down from a most high mountain; being
generated (I conceive) of great store of Vapours
which gather in some large hollownesses of the
same, and through secret passages ascend to its
Top. For on it there stands a certain Tree, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
covered with a Misty Cloud; which every
day melting at Noon, discharges it self so copiously
as to serve the whole <hi>Island;</hi> on which there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet fell a showre, save that one which was
forty days long.</p>

I have set down the <hi>high situation</hi> of these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
or Fountains, as forestalling an Objection,
that might thus be made. If the great Deeps,
whose Waters help'd to raise the Flood; were no
other than Caverns; the Waters they afforded
would contribute nothing to that use: for as soon
as <hi>they</hi> had come out, <hi>others</hi> would have run into
their places immediately, and so they had as good
have kept in still. But now these Caverns being
of an eminent or <hi>raised</hi> site, the Waters they yielded
towards the Flood, might help to swell it to its
due pitch, according as we have set it; without
any kind of danger, or indeed possibility, either of
their own returning, or of others running into their
room.</p>
               <p>In case it be urged that Caverns, especially Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
so high situate, cannot properly be called
<hi>great DEEPS:</hi> I answer, The HOLY GHOST
has been pleased to give them that name, and his
authority is not to be disputed. So we find him
styling the <hi>Red Sea,</hi>

                  <hi>the great Deep</hi>
(as big a name as can be given to the vastest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest
<hi>Ocean</hi> now, and a bigger than was given
to the <hi>whole Mass</hi> of Waters at first, it being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

was neither <hi>Great,</hi> nor <hi>Deep.</hi> Though those Caverns
which were opened at the Flood, might well be
as <hi>Deep,</hi> as they were <hi>Great;</hi> measuring their Depths,
from above, downward, towards the surface of the

               <p>And whereas the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks of <hi>the great

as but of <hi>one:</hi> this does not argue but the same

signification; (thus the Ark is said to rest upon
the <hi>Mountains</hi> of <hi>Ararat,</hi> when it could rest but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>one single</hi> Mountain:) so a <hi>Singular</hi> word, does
sometimes carry the force of a <hi>Plural</hi> one with it;
(thus, <gap reason="foreign">

the different Numbers used by the Holy Writers in
this Case, need not set them at variance, or imply,
that they intended different things. And then tho'
<hi>Moses</hi> speaks of the great <hi>Deep, singularly,</hi> as but
of, <hi>one;</hi> yet he speaks of <hi>all the Fountains</hi> of that

               <p>Should it be urged farther yet, that no such
<hi>Deeps</hi> or <hi>Caverns</hi> are found in the Earth now
adays, and therefore it may be questioned, whether
there ever were any or no: It might be answered.
Though there are many of them, yet they may
be of no easie discovery; as being inclosed with
very thick Walls, and shut up within vastest and
highest Mountains or Rocks. And truly so closely
and strongly were they immur'd, in the Predilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:102637:162"/>
State; that had not ALMIGHTY GOD
broken them up by his own Power (as he did
those in <hi>Rephidim</hi>) they might have continued en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
and undiscerned to this very day. Though
when by Omnipotence these mighty Cisterns of
Nature were let go, and their Waters run out in
a great measure; no wonder at all that the sides
of many of them should cave in; making the
Mountains or Rocks whereunto they belonged,
very rough, and craggy, and deformed things; and
scattering huge Stones, and such heaps of Rubbish
whereabouts they fell, as might imitate the Ruines
of a dissolved World; and show not only the Scars
of a broken-fac'd Earth, but moreover (as one
would think) the very Entrails of it strangely
burst out, and as it were, torn and mangled all
to pieces. And as a little marvel it is again, that
the Crowns of several high Rocks and Hills, sinking
right down into the Caverns beneath them, and
being not able to fill them up; should leave huge
Pans on their Tops respectively. While innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
others yet, that were broached and well nigh
drawn off at the Flood; have for many Ages stood
dry and gaping: and have been Dens for wild
Beasts; and sometimes Refuges, and sometimes, it
may be, Habitations for Men; as being of very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Capacities. Of this sort, 'tis like, was
that Cave in <hi>Engedi,</hi> which was able to receive
<hi>David</hi> and his Six hundred Men: and for ought
we know, might have held as many more. For
these are said to<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>remain in the sides of the Cave,</hi>
and were so well hidden; that King <hi>Saul,</hi> who was
there at the same time, perceived not one of them.
And that there were store of such Caves in <hi>Palestine,</hi>
into which (in time of Invasion by Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:102637:163"/>
the Inhabitants of the Country used to retire, even
by whole Villages or Towns at once; is very well
known.<note n="*" place="margin">Antiq. l. 14. c. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Iosephus</hi> makes mention of some of
these Caves in high Rocks and Mountains; which
being possessed by Robbers, King <hi>Herod</hi> was fain
to let down armed Souldiers an unspeakable depth
into them, in Chests with Iron Chains, to fight
the Wretches in those their Fastnesses.<note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Strabo</hi>
likewise reports, That towards <hi>Arabiae,</hi> and <hi>Iturea,</hi>
there are steep Mountains famous for deep Caves,
one of which is able to receive Four thousand
Men. Nor is it to be doubted but that in all
rocky and mountainous Regions, there are plenty of
most capacious Caverns.<note n="a" place="margin">Saepius e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim in consiniis vel in ipsis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sceribus monti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, quàm alibi, capacissimae ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernae reperium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur. <hi>Pag.</hi> 68.</note> The <hi>Theory</hi> it self al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
them to be more common in such places, than
elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Should any go on to object, That the Waters
issuing out of these Caverns, upon their Disruption,
would have made but a slender contribution to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
raising the mighty Universal Deluge: I
answer,</p>
               <p>First, They contributed as much to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as Divine Providence thought fit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They increased the Waters which ran
down the Mountains at the time of the Flood;
and so did service in hindring both Men and other
Creatures from ascending those Mountains; which
might be the <hi>chief</hi> work they were designed to do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Scripture it self lays the <hi>main</hi> of the
Flood upon the <hi>Rain-waters,</hi> ascribing it mostly to
them. For so GOD declares, <hi>Gen. 7. 4. Yet seven
days, and I will cause it to rain upon the Earth,
forty days, and forty nights; and every living sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
that I have made, will I destroy from of the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:102637:163"/>
face of the Earth.</hi> Where the great Deluge which
was to destroy the then Animal World; is owned
as proceeding from the forty days <hi>Rain.</hi> Intimating
that the Waters of it, were to rise mainly from
<hi>them;</hi> and as for those flowing out of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Deep, they were not to be of equal
quantity or use. And indeed had they been so,
they would have swelled the Flood to too high a pitch.
And therefore though they made but the least part
of that fatal Deluge; yet so long as they did what
was proper and needful, and what the great GOD
intended they should do; that was sufficient.</p>
               <p>If, Lastly, it be objected; How could Waters
come into these Caverns? I answer; By a very
natural and easie way; even the same way that
<hi>Springs</hi> do now rise and flow out of Rocks and
Mountains. For great Mountains having great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
in them, upon the account of their Origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as being heaved up by the force of that fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
fermentive moisture (turn'd into vapours)
wherewith the Earth at first abounded) how easily
would those Caverns be filled with vapours, by
the influence of the Sun; and then those vapours
condensed into Water, by the coldness of those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns?
For what were the great Mountainous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,
but as it were the Heads of vast <hi>Stills,</hi> as
much disposed by Nature to condense Vapours;
as the other are by Art. Yea, as cold Water, or
wet Cloths, are applied to the Heads of artificial
Stills, to help forward their work: So huge quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Snow, which outwardly and continually
cover the higher parts of some Mountains; might
have the like effect on Caverns within. Now
these Vapours being thus changed into Waters;
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:102637:164"/>
the Particles of <hi>that</hi> would certainly be too gross,
to sink down into the Earth again through the
little Pores, by which they ascended or were drawn
up out of it. So that unless it could find ways,
whereby to run forth and discharge it self at places
in the nature of <hi>Springs;</hi> there it was bound to
stay till Providence should release it from its close
imprisonment; which it did miraculously at the
time of the Flood, by breaking up the Caverns,
or <hi>great Deeps</hi> that contain'd it, and suffering a very
great deal of it to run out.</p>
               <p>So that still the <hi>great Deep Caverns of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
may very well pass for the <hi>Fountains of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses<hi>'s
Tehom Rabbah.</hi> And that which helps to
encourage (not to say) and confirm the Notion;
is, That <hi>no one</hi> of the several things, which have
been understood to be that <hi>great Deep;</hi> can fill up
the Character of it so fairly, and at the same
time answer the ends and uses of it, in respect of
the Deluge, so fully; as these Caverns. Not the
<hi>Open Sea;</hi> for as it could not properly be broke
open, as being open already; so the Waters of
<hi>that</hi> were by no means sufficient to make such a
Flood, as <hi>Noah</hi>'s has been all-a-long reputed. Or
in case they had been sufficient; yet being drawn
out of the Sea, to drown the Earth, what Waters
should have filled the Sea again? Or if it stood
empty, what should have hindred the same Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from running back into it? Not the <hi>Waters in
the Bowels of the Earth:</hi> for if they were there in
such plenty (as 'tis confest there is room enough
for them) as to have been able to have made a much
greater Flood than <hi>Noah</hi>'s; yet then against their
nature they must have risen above their Source;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:102637:164"/>
and being so risen, they must have stood, so long as
the Flood lasted, in a miraculous opposition to their
own nature, inclining them to retire from whence
they came. Not the <hi>Supercelestial Waters:</hi> for then
the <hi>breaking up of the Fountains of the great Deep;</hi>
and the <hi>opening of the Windows of Heaven;</hi> must
be one and the same thing. Whereas by <hi>Moses</hi> they
are very plainly and carefully distinguisht. Not
the <hi>inclosed Abyss;</hi> for then (besides that the whole
<hi>Hypothesis,</hi> so improbable, must be allowed) the
forty days Rain would have been utterly needless.
Because then the <hi>falling of the Earth into the Abyss,</hi>
being <hi>the breaking up of the Fountains of the great
Deep;</hi> it must have fallen in, the very <hi>first</hi>
day that <hi>Noah</hi> went into the Ark; because on that
very day <hi>all the Fountains of the great Deep were
broken up, Gen.</hi> 7. 11. And if by the Earth's fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into the Abyss, the World were drowned the
first day that <hi>Noah</hi> entered the Ark (as of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
it must have been, if the Earth were dissolved
and fell that day) to what purpose should it after
that, rain for forty days together? And whereas it is
said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 2. That <hi>the Fountains of the Deep were
stopped;</hi> the Earth broken down into the Abyss was
never <hi>made up</hi> again, nor the Abyss it self <hi>covered;</hi>
but remains still as <hi>open</hi> as ever: To which Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Heads, let me add but one more, which
has a kind of general Relation to them all. If either
the <hi>open Sea,</hi> or the <hi>Waters within the Earth, or
the Waters above the Heavens,</hi> or the <hi>Abyss under
the Earth,</hi> had been the <hi>great Deep</hi> meant by <hi>Mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s;</hi>
none of them had any <hi>true</hi> or proper <hi>Fountains</hi> in
them. And so what will become of, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>all
the Fountains <hi>of the great Deep?</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:102637:165"/>
But now supposing that the <hi>Caverns</hi> in the
Mountains were this <hi>great Deep;</hi> how surprizingly
do all these things fall in with them? For
First, They are called <hi>great Deeps</hi> by the HOLY
GHOST (as has been noted) <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
They were capable of being cleaved or broke
open; as being fast shut up. Thirdly, They
were able to afford a competent quantity of Water;
even as much as it was necessary they should yield.
Fourthly, The Water that came forth of them,
could never return into them more. Fifthly, The
breaking them up, must be quite another thing,
than opening the Windows of Heaven. Sixthly, They
might all be broke up the same day that <hi>Noah</hi>
took into the Ark. Seventhly, The Rain which
fell in the forty days, would still have been as
needful as ever. Eighthly, They were stopped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
as strictly and literally, as they were broken
up. Lastly, They were as <hi>true</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
as any in the World. So that if they were
not the <hi>real</hi> Fountains of the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Tehom
Rabbah; one would think they might well have
been so.</p>
               <p>5. But let us now pass (as it is time we should)
to a <hi>Second Ground</hi> upon which we build the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi>
of our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> above specified; namely,
That <hi>the Flood was but fifteen Cubits higher than the
highest parts of the surface of the Earth.</hi> And that
Ground is this: Supposing <hi>that</hi> to have been the
<hi>true height</hi> of the Flood, it will not only be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but very easie to find Water enough for it,
without recourse to such Inventions; as have been,
and justly may be disgustful, not only to nice and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:102637:165"/>
squeamish, but to the best and soundest Philosophic
Judgments.</p>
               <p>For thus, in the <hi>First</hi> place, we need not call in
the <hi>Theory</hi>'s assistance; an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> (how ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
soever in the contrivance and contexture of it)
guilty of unjustifiable absurdities.</p>
               <p>Nor, <hi>Secondly,</hi> need we fly to a <hi>New Creation of
Water,</hi> to gain a sufficient quantity of it. An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
that sounds harshly in the Ears of many.
And that not only because they are of Opinion,
that GOD finisht the work of Creation in the
first six days; But because he has expresly declared,
That the true and only Causes of the Deluge were
these Two; The <hi>breaking up of all the Fountains of the
great Deep,</hi> and the <hi>opening of the Windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
To which may be added, That the Creation
of so vast a quantity of Water, as should have
surmounted the highest Hills; would certainly have
inferred, either an enlargement of the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
to receive it; and so a Dislocation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
a disorder of its parts respectively: or else
a Penetration of the Dimensions of Bodies; while so
much new matter should have sprung into being,
more than ever existed; and yet have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to the same space of aboad, that was before
fill'd up in its whole capacity.</p>
               <p>Nor need we, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to fetch Waters from the
<hi>Supercelestial Regions.</hi> Where, if the Heavens be
<hi>Fluid,</hi> how could they have kept from falling down,
so long? And if they be <hi>Solid,</hi> how could they
possibly have descended at last? For in their descent
they must have bored their way through several
Orbs as <hi>hard</hi> as Crystal, and how <hi>thick,</hi> we know
not. Besides, these Waters must have been lodg'd
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:102637:166"/>
either below the <hi>Stars,</hi> or <hi>above</hi> them. If <hi>below</hi>
them, they would have hid them from our sight.
The Sun himself cannot be seen through a watry
Cloud; how much less the Stars through a watry
Ocean? Nor will it help, to say, the Element of
Water above is more fine and transparent than the
Waters below. For were it as thin as an ordinary
Mist, still it would hide the Sun's <hi>Face</hi> from us,
though it might transmit his <hi>light.</hi> In case they
were plac'd above the Stars, <hi>they</hi> must have been
delug'd before the Earth could have been so; as
intercepting them in their fall. Nor could they
have slid off the Stars again, dropping down to the
Earth, unless that were the Center of the Universe,
which is hard to prove; yea, most absurd to
think.</p>
               <p>Nor will it be necessary, in the <hi>Fourth</hi> place, to
suppose the <hi>Mass of Air,</hi> or greatest part of it,
<hi>was changed into Water,</hi> to make the Deluge. A
change which some will by no means admit of, as
being not hitherto proved by Experiment. Yet I
cannot but own that the best Philosophers have
thought it fecible, and also believed it to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
done. The<note n="*" place="margin">

Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> (in his 22. Experiment)
leaves it undetermin'd, <hi>whether or no Air be a primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial
Body, that cannot now be generated and turned
into Water.</hi> And truly as <hi>Clavius</hi> his Glass of
Spring-water (mentioned in that Experiment) Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically
sealed up for fifty Years past, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited
in the <hi>Musaeum Kercherianum;</hi> does not
prove that Water can't be turn'd into Air, because
the Water continu'd there so long without diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
so neither will M. <hi>Rohault</hi>'s Glass seal'd up
the same way full of Air, and kept in a Vessel of
Water in a Wine-Cellar three whole Years; argue
that Air can't be turn'd into Water, because none
of that Air at the three Years end, was found to
have suffered such a change; there being not the
least drop of Water in the Glass. We only learn
from hence, that we have not yet attain'd to the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:102637:167"/>
right Operation, of changing these Elements into one
another.</p>
               <p>We will grant therefore that by the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Air may be turned into Water. Yet neither will
<hi>that</hi> take off the whole Difficulty in this Case. For if
<hi>most</hi> of the Air incircling the Earth, had been thus
changed (and <hi>all</hi> of it could not, because then respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
would have been impossible to Mankind, and the
surviving Animals in the Ark) it could not have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
Water enough for the Flood; a great deal of Air
going to make up a little quantity of Water: (Which
the proportion of gravity betwixt Water and Air, of
equal bulk, it being (found to be) as of a thousand
to one; does sufficiently evince.) But in case it could
have yielded Water enough, yet inconveniences would
still have remained. Particularly, it would have endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
sucking down the Moon, as the <hi>Theorist</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">English <hi>Theor.</hi> p. 21.</note> observes.
The changing also of one great Body into another,
which after transmutation takes up so much less room
than it did before; does either suppose that the whole
Frame of the World must sink closer together (which
would occasion a strange discomposure in it) to fill up
the space <hi>that</hi> Change would make empty: or that in
Nature there must be a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> Though (by the
way) when our SAVIOUR multiplied Bread upon
Earth, <hi>that</hi> need have no such influence on the
World, either as to <hi>expansion</hi> or <hi>contraction</hi> of it; as
the new <hi>Creation</hi> of Waters above mentioned, or this
production of them by <hi>transmutation,</hi> does imply. For
besides that the Matter changed was much less in
<hi>quantity;</hi> the change might be made in such a Substance,
as did take up just the same room in the World before
its mutation, as after it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:102637:167"/>
Nor need we to apply our selves, in the <hi>Fifth</hi>
place, to that Hypothesis which makes this Globe
of ours <hi>bi-central:</hi> giving one Center to the <hi>Earth</hi> and
another to the <hi>Waters</hi> in it; according to this Figure.

                     <p>Fig: 4 Pag: 317</p>
                  </figure>
That so by setting the Waters higher than the Earth,
they might the more easily overflow it at such a rate,
as they have been conceived to do, at the Deluge. But
this is a Supposition so notoriously false, that to prove
it to be so, would be a vain work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:102637:168"/>
Nor need we trouble our selves in the <hi>Sixth</hi> place
about <hi>Sub-terrestrial</hi> Waters. Which (if never so
free passages had been opened for them) could no
more have flowed up out of the Bowels of the
Earth; than Waters can do out of our deepest
Wells. Yea, with much more difficulty they must
have ascended, in regard they were far deeper in the
ground; and also must have boiled up against the
weight and pressure of the incumbent Flood,
even then when perhaps it was a Mile or two
high.</p>
               <p>As for Blood flowing out of a Vein (when
prickt) in a Man's Head; it is nothing like a Proof
that Water may rise and flow above its source.
For there is a vital strength and motion forcing it
out, and Nature conspires as much to help the
Course of that Blood, as she does to hinder this
Course of the Waters we speak of. Engines it may
be in the heart of the Earth, might be able to send
up Waters on to the surface of it; as the Heart in
the midst of the Body, sends Blood to its Extremities.
But we hear of no Engines made to raise the
Flood.</p>
               <p>Nor need we, in the <hi>Last</hi> place, to betake our
selves to a <hi>Topical</hi> or <hi>Partial Deluge.</hi> A thing
which some have done, meerly to avoid the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of such a <hi>vast deal</hi> of Water, as they knew
not where to have for a <hi>general</hi> Flood, according
to the rate of the old <hi>Hypothesis:</hi> or in case they
could have had it, knew not how to get rid of it
again. Whereas let <hi>fifteen Cubits above the Earth,</hi>
be the highest Water-mark of the Flood; and then
as the Clouds and Caverns would have yielded
Water enough to raise it: so when its work was
done, the quantity of this Water would not have
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:102637:168"/>
been so excessive, but it might easily be dried up
in that space of time, in which <hi>Moses</hi> declares it
was so.</p>
               <p>And this is that which in the Second place, gives
countenance to our <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> It makes the Flood
to be such, as Nature out of her Store-houses could
very well send on to the Earth; and when she had
done, as conveniently take it off again. And so we
are excused from running to those Causes or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
which seem unreasonable to some, and
unintelligible to others, and unsatisfactory to
most.</p>
               <p>6. A <hi>Third</hi> thing, which gives credit to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
and makes it look like truth; is its agreeing
so handsomely with St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Description of the
Deluge. <hi>The Heavens were of old, and the Earth
standing out of the Water and in the Water, whereby
the World that then was, being overflowed with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
perished, 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 5, 6. How exactly does this
suite with the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> proposed? For according
to it, the Earth stood partly, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
the most of it being overflowed; and in such
a measure, as that the Animal <hi>World</hi> thereby <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.</hi>
And yet a great part of the Earth (as
much as the upper parts of high Mountains come
to) was <hi>standing <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, out of the Water,</hi> at the same
time. Yea, if a <hi>Zeugma</hi> in the words, makes,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>standing,</hi> relate to, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Heavens,</hi> as
well as to, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Earth;</hi> yet our Explication of
the Deluge will fall in very fairly with <hi>that</hi> too.
Inasmuch as the Heavens stood then <hi>in the Water,</hi>
and <hi>out of the Water,</hi> as well as the Earth. For
<hi>their</hi> Territories were then invaded in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
the Water rising, where it incroached least,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:102637:169"/>
fifteen; in most places, it may be, thirty, forty, or
fifty Cubits into them. And therefore so high they
were standing in the Water; as all above was standing
out of the same. And which is something more,
the Heavens and the Earth will thus be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>standing together</hi> out of the Water and in the Water
(as some will have the word signifie there) both
of them being in the like circumstances, at the same
juncture of time. I will only add under this head,
That taking the <hi>Heavens</hi> here mention'd, for the
<hi>lowest Region</hi> of the Air, or for the lower part of that
Region; is but consonant to the Sacred Style.</p>
               <p>7. A <hi>Fourth</hi> advantage commending our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi>
is, That it puts the drowned Earth, into a far more
habitable condition at the Flood's going off, than
otherwise it could have been in. That <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood
was Universal, is most clear from Scripture. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
I, even I do bring a flood of waters upon the
earth, to destroy <hi>all flesh</hi> wherein is the breath of life,
<hi>from under heaven,</hi> and <hi>every thing</hi> that is in the
earth shall die,</hi> Gen. 6. 17. So the ALMIGHTY
threatned; and what he threatned he fully made
good. <hi>And <hi>all flesh</hi> died that moved upon the earth,
both of fowl, and of cattel, and of beast, and of every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every
man. All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all
that was in the dry land, died. And <hi>every living sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
was destroyed, which was upon the face of the
ground, both man and cattel, and the creeping things, and
the fowl of heaven; they were destroyed from the earth;
and Noah <hi>only</hi> remained alive, and they that were with him
in the ark,</hi> Gen. 7. 21, 22, 23. And if <hi>all flesh under
heaven,</hi> and <hi>every thing in the earth,</hi> even <hi>every living
substance upon the face of the ground, were destroyed and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:102637:169"/>
died; and Noah only remained alive, and the creatures
in the ark:</hi> hence it will follow, that the <hi>whole Earth</hi>
was drowned, or else that Mankind was not generally
spread through all the Regions of the same. But that
the Earth was generally inhabited before the Deluge,
we need not doubt, nor can we well deny. For the
Consequence would be, That the Prediluvians begat
fewer Children, or lived shorter lives, than the Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvians;
which would not be phanciful on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but false. Though truly if some Countries had
not been peopled, still they must have been drowned;
that so <hi>fowl</hi> and <hi>creeping things,</hi> &amp;c. might be destroyed,
according to the Testimony of the HOLY GHOST.
Yet admitting this, that the <hi>entire</hi> Earth was overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and that to such an height, that the loftiest Hills
(as is commonly believed) had their Tops fifteen
Cubits under Water: and what a Case must the Earth
have been in, upon drying up of the Flood? What a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Mud, Slime, and Filthiness, must every
where have covered the surface of it? How thick must
it have lain? How close must it have stuck? And how
hard would it have been to have clear'd the ground of
it? <hi>Attica,</hi> upon this account, (as was observed before)
after a far less Flood, was not peopled for the space of
three hundred Years.</p>
               <p>Nor will the <hi>Theory</hi>'s Explication of the Deluge,
help here; unless it be to make things worse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For had
the Flood been caused by so strange a <hi>fraction</hi> and
<hi>falling in</hi> of the Earth, as that supposeth; this would
have added very much to its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oulness, and so to its Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness
for a time (as above remembred) and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to its unfitness for immediate habitation.</p>
               <p>But now according to the way that we go, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost
parts of Mountains could never be drowned;
and so never clogg'd neither, or dawb'd over with the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:102637:170"/>
filth of the roiled Waters. So that let but the floating
Ark, have stopped at last by the side of some very
large Hill; and the Earth would there have been
ready to receive all that came out of it. And that
after all its Tossings, it did rest <hi>near to,</hi> or in some
sense <hi>upon</hi> such a tall vast Hill (perhaps the biggest
the Earth has) is rightly believed, as being taught
from above. And indeed its doing so, seems to be
no other than a signal Providence, and a special ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Heavens particular Care. That so those few
Creatures, which out-lived that grievous <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
or <hi>general destruction</hi> that fell so heavy on the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
World, might not be destitute of fit habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and sustenance.</p>
               <p>And truely that Mankind, upon quitting the
Ark, did inhabit Mountains for a considerable time;
may be gathered (as some think) out of the Tenth
and Eleventh Chapters of <hi>Genesis.</hi> For there it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that they were grown numerous (say they)
when they left the Hills, and came down to settle in
the Plains of <hi>Shinar.</hi> But then if they <hi>did</hi> chuse the
Hills for their Seat, and stay there so long before
they removed their Quarters; one reason might be the
unfitness of the lower grounds to entertain them,
as affording at first no commodious Dwellings. And
whereas they would have them to keep on the Hills
with design to secure themselves from future Floods:
such a Design would have been utterly vain. For
what security could they expect, by their abode in
Mountains, from Floods to come; when the highest
Mountains were over-top'd no less than fifteen Cubits,
by one so lately past?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:102637:170"/>
8. A <hi>Fifth</hi> Plea which may be taken up in favour
of our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> is its Coherence with Geography.
Wherein it seems to be much more plausible than the
<hi>old Hypothesis,</hi> or that of the <hi>Theory.</hi> It falls in with it,
by a far more natural and justifiable Compliance, than
either of <hi>them</hi> do. As for the <hi>Theory,</hi> it flatly denies
that there were Hills or Valleys, or Seas, or Islands
before the Flood: which Geography hitherto never
dreamt of. The old <hi>Hypothesis</hi> also makes the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Ararat</hi> or <hi>Armenia,</hi> the highest in the Earth:
and this, Geography again cannot down with. And
indeed the chief reason why <hi>they</hi> have been reputed
the highest, is, because the Ark has always been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to rest on the top of them; and in that regard
it was requisite they should be the highest. But <hi>our
Hypothesis</hi> ties up none to the belief of this neither.
Nor indeed does it seem to be worthy of credit, as shall
be noted by and by.</p>

               <p>1. WE have seen a <hi>New way</hi> of explaining the
Flood proposed: or a <hi>New Hypothesis</hi>
concerning it erected. We have seen how it is built;
upon what Grounds it stands; and with what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and considerations it is supported and establisht.
But as things that are new and any whit strange,
are commonly received with more than ordinary
Notice; so <hi>new Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>strange Hypotheses,</hi> are
usually entertain'd with <hi>Disputes</hi> and <hi>Objections.</hi> It
will be necessary therefore to look out a little, and
to see what Objections are like to meet us in the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:102637:171"/>
way that we go: and so to apply Answers to them
respectively; at least to the chief of them.</p>
               <p>2. But first, I must premise, that we have no
reason to take <hi>this</hi> for an Objection (I mean from
the <hi>Theorist,</hi> or others who take their measures
from him) that we expound a Text or two of
Scripture so as none ever did; and deserting the
common received sense, put an unusual Gloss upon
them (not to say, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a private interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>)
This, I say, is not to be urged against us
by the <hi>Theorist,</hi> or by <hi>those</hi> that think fit to abide
by his <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> For himself exceeds us in the
same thing. We only take a few steps, out of the
beaten path of Expositors; and that with open
and professed diffidence: whereas he has advanced,
in as untroden a way, with a great deal of
boldness.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>First Objection</hi> may be raised, from <hi>the
Hills being covered.</hi> So we read <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 19. That
<hi>all the high hills under the whole heaven were covered.</hi>
And verse 20. <hi>Fifteen cubits upward did the waters
prevail, and the mountains were covered.</hi> Whence it
has been concluded, That the Waters of the Flood
prevailed to such an height, that they covered the
<hi>tops</hi> of the highest Hills under Heaven Fifteen Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
upward. But the Holy Text says no such
thing. It tells us indeed, That the Waters <hi>prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fifteen Cubits upwards;</hi> but this might be meant
as to the <hi>Earth</hi> only: upon which, it had told us
just before, the Waters <hi>prevailed</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
exceedingly.</hi> And truly when they came
to be fifteen Cubits upward on the highest parts of
the surface of the Earth; whereby they might be
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:102637:172"/>
four or five times as high above its general <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies</hi>
(as we have observed) this was really a
<hi>great</hi> and <hi>exceeding</hi> prevalence. But where it speaks
of the <hi>high hills</hi> and <hi>mountains,</hi> it says no more of
them, than, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>and they were covered.</hi> And so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they were, and fifteen Cubits upward too,
that is, on their sides. For the Waters prevailing
so high above the surface of the Earth whereon
they were founded, the bottoms of them must needs
stand up so deep in those Waters. But to affirm
the Tops of them did so, is perhaps to make the
Comment out-run the Text, <hi>they</hi> being not said to
be covered.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Original</hi> may bear this Interpretation;
so the <hi>Septuagint</hi> seems not to disallow it. For
<hi>that</hi> renders the <hi>Hebrew</hi> thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>the water was lifted up fifteen Cubits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi>
But it does not in the least express, that
it was lifted up so many Cubits above the <hi>tops</hi> of
the high Hills and Mountains. Nor will the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Latin</hi> dissent from it, if rightly understood. It
says, <hi>Quindecim cubitis altior fuit aqua super montes
quos operuerat. The Water was fifteen Cubits higher
upon the Mountains which it had covered.</hi> But then,
<hi>altior super montes,</hi> may not signifie, that it was
higher <hi>upon the tops</hi> (as was said before) but only
<hi>upon</hi> or <hi>about</hi> the <hi>sid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> of the Mountains. And so
(I remember) when <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> would express Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
sitting <hi>about</hi> a Table; he says, They were <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
mensam.</hi> And when he would express their
sitting <hi>about</hi> a Banquet; he says, They were <hi>super
vinum &amp; epulas.</hi> According to which, <hi>Water fifteen
Cubits high</hi> super montes; may be Water so high
<hi>about</hi> the Mountains: and so high indeed it had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:102637:172"/>
And the truth is, the Waters of the Flood never
were, nor could be fifteen Cubits above the Tops
of the highest Mountains; though we allow the
Assertors of the <hi>Old Hypothesis,</hi> to expound the Story
of the Flood their own way. To make this
out,</p>
               <p>We read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 4. That <hi>the ark rested upon the
mountains of Ararat,</hi>

                  <hi>The
bulk of the Ark pierced through the Waters,</hi> and so
the bottom of it stood upon the Mountain under
it. Nor could it rest or sit there <hi>otherwise,</hi> because
the Tops of the Mountains were not as yet above
Water, the Flood being at its height. For when
was it that the Ark thus rested? Why, <hi>in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Month, on the seventeenth day of the Month.</hi>
And then was the Deluge at the highest. For it is said
(<hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 24.) That <hi>the waters prevailed upon the
earth an hundred and fifty days.</hi> That is (according
to the Assertors of the Old <hi>Hypothesis</hi>) they were
increasing, or kept as high as ever for so long
time. Which (as the <hi>Iews</hi> used to reckon their
Months, making them all <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to consist of
<hi>thirty days</hi> apiece) will amount to five Months pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely.
So that count from the seventeenth day of
the Second Month, when the Flood began to come
in; to the sev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>teenth day of the Seventh Month,
when the Ark sat upon the Mountains of <hi>Ararat:</hi>
and the hundred and fifty days will be expired
just. But then if the Ark rested upon those
Mountains at <hi>that time,</hi> and in <hi>that manner,</hi> as is
said; it is most certain that the <hi>tops</hi> of the
<hi>highest</hi> Hills, could never be covered by Water, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Cubits upward. For then if the bottom of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:102637:173"/>
the Ark had rested on the Mountains, the whole
Body of it must have been quite under Water, and
we know not how deep. The reason is, because
there are Mountains in the World, very much
higher than those of <hi>Ararat.</hi> For by those Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
the Assertors of the common <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
understand the Mountains of <hi>Armenia.</hi> And
the <hi>Vulgar</hi> says expresly, That the Ark rested upon
the Mountains of <hi>Armenia.</hi> And the <hi>Septuagint</hi>

                  </gap>, as pointing
at the <hi>Cordiaean</hi> Hills. But that there are Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
much higher than <hi>they,</hi> is evident enough
from most considerable Writers.<note n="†" place="margin">Hist. of the World, <hi>l. 1. c.</hi> 7. §. 10. † X.</note> Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>

Mountains of</hi> Gordiaei—<hi>are the highest of the

deliver this as his own judgment only, but presently
adds,<note n="*" place="margin">† XI.</note> That <hi>the best Cosmographers, with others

surmounting any Mountain that ever hath been seen

                     </gap> to be of that
height, as neither the Winds, Clouds, or Rain over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top
it. Solinus,</hi> I confess, says as much, and his
authority, I presume, has given credit to the thing.
But <hi>Ludovicus</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Vives</hi> seems to confute it; and tells
us of one, who going up the Mountain to search
out the truth of the report, found it to be false.
Though when Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> preferred <hi>Olympus,</hi>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:102637:173"/>
as to its height, before the <hi>Armenian</hi> Hills; he was
certainly in the right. He brings in <hi>Antandrus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
averring <hi>that</hi> for height, to <hi>be of a <hi>far more
admiration,</hi> than any in</hi> Armenia. And also <hi>the
famous Mountains of</hi> Atlas, <hi>so high that the eye of
no mortal Man can discern the top:</hi> for which he
quotes <hi>Herodotus.</hi> And lastly, he concludes the
<hi>Pike</hi> of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> to be the highest Mountain of
the known World. And so do others as well as
he, whereof <hi>Varennius</hi> is one. Yet some again take
the <hi>American Andes</hi> to surpass all. Though <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casus</hi>
alone might have done our business. For as
<hi>that</hi> is a part of <hi>Taurus,</hi> as the Mountains of
<hi>Ararat</hi> are; so it is known to all (who know any
thing of that nature) to be much higher than
they.</p>
               <p>Now the Mountains of <hi>Ararat</hi> being certainly
much lower than several others; here is perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
(to the Assertors of the general standing
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the Flood) that the Waters could not
(according to their <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Story of the Flood) cover <hi>all the
high Hills</hi> under heaven fifteen Cubits upward, I
mean, the tops of them. For then the Ark could
not have rested on the lower ones of <hi>Ararat,</hi>
without being plunged under Water, and wholly
swallowed up; the Flood being at its highest pitch
when it rested there.</p>
               <p>And since it is evident, yea, plainly demonstrated,
that the tops of the highest Hills could not be
covered according to the tenor of the usual <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis;</hi>
it is absolutely necessary, not only in regard
of <hi>our Hypothesis,</hi> but in respect to the very Story
of the Flood; to interpret <hi>the Mountains being
covered,</hi> to some other sense than has been put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:102637:174"/>
it. And that will bring on a like necessity of
setting up a <hi>new Hypothesis</hi> for explaining the Flood;
whether ours may be it or no.</p>
               <p>Let us now therefore (as it is necessary) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after another sense of <hi>the Mountains being
covered.</hi> And First, there is a known <hi>Figure</hi> that
frequently occurs in the Holy Volume (as might
be proved by a large Induction of instances)
whereby what is true of a thing but in <hi>part;</hi> is
notwithstanding affirmed of the <hi>whole.</hi> And in this
sense all the high Hills under Heaven might be
said to be covered; because in <hi>part</hi> they were so,
that is so far as the Waters reach'd up the sides of
them. Or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, If there be not a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> in the
case, there may be an <hi>Hyperbole.</hi> The <hi>Mountains</hi>
may be said to be <hi>covered,</hi> to raise the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Flood, and make it more stately, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an Air of excessive greatness into it. so we
may observe, that there are few very grand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
things in Scripture; but the Mountains or
Hills are brought in, to bear a part in their Character:
to adorn and signalize, or set off their magnificence
or excess. Thus a great <hi>steadiness</hi> is express'd by
the <hi>stability</hi> of <hi>Mountains, Psal. 125. 1. They that
trust in the LORD, shall be as <hi>mount</hi> Zion, which
cannot be removed.</hi> A great <hi>safeguard</hi> or <hi>protection;</hi>
by an <hi>inclosure</hi> or <hi>incompassment</hi> with <hi>Mountains:</hi>
as in the next Verse. <hi>The <hi>mountains</hi> are round
about Ierusalem; so the LORD is round about his
people.</hi> A great <hi>destruction;</hi> by the <hi>trembling of
Mountains</hi> and <hi>removing of Hills,</hi> Jer. 4. 24. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the <hi>Mountains,</hi> and lo they trembled, and all
the <hi>Hills</hi> moved lightly.</hi> So a great <hi>fear</hi> is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Mens calling out <hi>to <hi>Mountains</hi> to fall on
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:102637:174"/>
them, and to <hi>hills</hi> to cover them,</hi> S. Luk. 23. 30.
A great <hi>change;</hi> by the passing away or <hi>disappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of <hi>mountains, <hi>Rev.</hi>
                  </hi> 16. 20. A great <hi>victory;</hi>
by <hi>threshing the <hi>mountains,</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>making the <hi>hills</hi>
as chaff, Isai.</hi> 41. 15. A great <hi>joy;</hi> by <hi>the singing
of <hi>mountains,</hi> Isai.</hi> 44. 23. A great <hi>slaughter;</hi> by
Blood reaching to the <hi>Mountains.</hi> So GOD threatens
to <hi>water the land of</hi> Egypt <hi>with blood, even to the
<hi>mountains,</hi> Ezek.</hi> 32. 6. And that the <hi>mountains
<hi>shall be</hi> melted <hi>with the blood</hi>
                  </hi> of nations, <hi>Isai.</hi> 34. 3.
As if Blood were not only to swim <hi>about</hi> the
Mountains, and to run <hi>over</hi> the <hi>tops</hi> of them, as
<hi>Noah</hi>'s Waters (are presum'd to have done) but
even to dissolve them and wash them quite down.
Well might <hi>Moses</hi> hyperbolize as he did, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
the Deluge of Water; when the Prophet
thus exceeds him in foretelling an Inundation of
Blood.</p>
               <p>By no means, may some object: and you have
hinted the <hi>reason</hi> of it. Even because what <hi>Isaiah</hi>
spake was in way of <hi>Prediction;</hi> and such <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles</hi>
though they be common in <hi>Prophecies,</hi> are
not used in <hi>History.</hi> I answer, Such <hi>Hyperbolical</hi>
Schemes of Speech, are used in <hi>Historical,</hi> as well
as in <hi>Prophetical</hi> matters. Thus the <hi>Psalmist</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
to the majestic or great solemnity at the
Promulgation of the Law; says, <hi>the <hi>hills</hi> melted like
wax,</hi> Psal. 97. 5. And relating some circumstances
of <hi>Israels</hi> passing out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he says the <hi>moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<hi>skipped like rams, and the little</hi> hills <hi>like
lambs,</hi>
                  </hi> Psal. 114. 4. And if against this it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that the <hi>Psalms</hi> are <hi>Poetical,</hi> and so these
may be flights of Phancy, allowable to <hi>Poets</hi> only;
(though to inspired ones, as well as to other:) I
answer, The like occurs in other Books of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:102637:175"/>
Scripture. <hi>Isaiah,</hi> for instance, reflecting upon great
and terrible things that GOD had done for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
sets them forth by this Expression, <hi>The <hi>moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
flowed down at thy presence,</hi> Isai. 64. 3. And
<hi>Habakkuk</hi> commemorating GOD's miraculous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in bringing the <hi>Israelites</hi> into <hi>Canaan;</hi>
says, <hi>the everlasting <hi>mountains</hi> were scattered, the
perpetual <hi>hills</hi> did bow,</hi> Hab. 3. 6. And at the
<hi>tenth</hi> Verse, <hi>the <hi>mountains</hi> saw thee, and they
trembled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that when <hi>Moses</hi> described the Deluge, in so
superlative or transcendent a strain, as by its <hi>cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>mountains,</hi> and all the <hi>high hills</hi> under
heaven;</hi> it might be but to ingrandize or amplifie
the thing. It might be but an high flying orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<hi>Hyperbole,</hi> used to grace and greaten the
Flood in his Description of it, and to render it the
more stately. Or,</p>
               <p>Lastly, We must know; that to <hi>cover</hi> a thing in
Holy Style, is not always to <hi>surmount</hi> and <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm</hi>
it: but very frequently to surround it only,
or to be <hi>about</hi> it in <hi>great plenty</hi> or abundance. For
so the HOLY GHOST does commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the <hi>copiousness</hi> of one thing by its <hi>covering</hi>
another. Thus <hi>precious stones,</hi> are said to be a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering</hi>
to the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> Ezek. 28. 13. because they
wore them in great plenty about them. And the
<hi>Iews</hi> are said to <hi>cover <hi>the altar of the LORD
with tears and weeping, and with crying out,</hi>
                  </hi> Mal. 2.
13. because they shed their Tears, and uttered their
complaints very freely and plentifully thereabouts.
So (in the same sense) some are said to be <hi>cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
with shame; and others, to be <hi>covered</hi> with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and others, to be <hi>covered</hi> with violence.
Whence it is evident, that it is a Phrase whereby
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:102637:175"/>
is expressed the <hi>plenty</hi> or exuberance of one thing
above another. And so the <hi>Mountains</hi> and <hi>high
Hills</hi> being <hi>covered</hi> with Waters, will signifie no more,
than that they were surrounded with vast quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of them. But a more adequate and evictive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this, <hi>Moses</hi> himself (the fittest Man that
could be in the case) has given us. <hi>Who,</hi> setting
down the Story of the <hi>Quails,</hi> Exod. 16. 13. says,
That <hi>at even the quail came up and <hi>covered</hi> the
camp.</hi> And how did these Quails <hi>cover</hi> the Camp?
He informs us, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 13. they <hi>fell by the
camp as it were a days journey on this side, and a
days journey on that side, <hi>round about</hi> the camp.</hi>
But then as the Camps being <hi>covered</hi> with the
Quails, was no more (in <hi>Moses's</hi> language) than
its being <hi>surrounded</hi> with a <hi>multitude</hi> of them; so
the Mountains being <hi>covered</hi> with Waters, was
no more than their being <hi>surrounded</hi> with <hi>great
plenty</hi> of them. And, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifies, <hi>covered,</hi>
Gen. 7. 19, 20. and, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that signifies, <hi>covered,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and
are but one and the same word. As if by using
the same word in both places, he would inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
that he meant but the same thing in both
Stories.</p>
               <p>4. A <hi>Second Objection,</hi> may be <hi>the arks resting
upon the mountains of Ararat,</hi> Gen. 8. 4. For that
implys that the Waters of the Flood did certainly
swell up above the tops of those Mountains; else
how could the Ark have been carried up thither,
and have rested there? I answer,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:102637:176"/>
First, That, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is there rendred, <hi>upon;</hi>
does sometimes in Scripture, signifie, <hi>by.</hi> As
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>by <hi>the rivers of water,</hi>
                  </hi> Psal. 1. 3.
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>by <hi>the camp,</hi>
                  </hi> Numb. 11. 13. And so
here, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, may signifie no more than, <hi>by
<hi>the mountains of</hi>
                  </hi> Ararat.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If we yield the Ark to have rested
<hi>upon</hi> the Mountains of <hi>Ararat;</hi> yet then it might
rest somewhere upon the <hi>foot</hi> or lowest part of
those Mountains: for it is no where said to rest
upon the <hi>top</hi> of them. And so this passage in the
<hi>Divine</hi> Story, will not infer the least necessity of
that vast height of the Flood, which it has usually
been set at.</p>
               <p>And then as to <hi>Civil</hi> Story, which tells how
the Ark rested on the top of those Mountains;
we take leave to observe, that it is all-a-long charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
either with <hi>incertainty,</hi> or with <hi>incongruity.</hi> It
is still either <hi>Doubtful,</hi> as to the <hi>Thing;</hi> or <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi>
with <hi>it self.</hi> Thus, for example,<note n="*" place="margin">Antiq. l. 1. c. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Iosephus</hi> gives
account out of <hi>Berosus,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. that <hi>a part of
the Ship</hi> (the Ark) <hi>is in</hi> Armenia, on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the <hi>Cordiaeans.</hi> But then this is ushered in
with a, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, so <hi>it is said;</hi> which makes the thing
<hi>doubtful.</hi> And then, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may as well be
rendred, near <hi>the Mountain,</hi> as <hi>on</hi> it. The same
<hi>Iosephus,</hi> in the same Chapter also, thus certifies
out of <hi>Nicolaus Damascenus.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
&amp;c. <hi>Above</hi> Minias <hi>there is a great Mountain in</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia
<hi>called</hi> Baris, <hi>on which many that fled thither
were saved in time of the Flood: and that a certain
Man brought in an Ark, arrived at the top of the
Mountain, and that the reliques of the Timber were
kept there a long time.</hi> But then this is delivered
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:102637:176"/>
                  <hi>incertainly</hi> again, with a, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, so <hi>it is reported.</hi>
And for a matter to be <hi>reported,</hi> is one thing; and
really to <hi>be so,</hi> is another. And indeed this report
agrees not with truth. For it says, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
<hi>that <hi>many
flying</hi> to this Mountain were saved.</hi> Whereas Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
on the contrary assures us that <hi>but few</hi> were
saved: and that not <hi>one</hi> was saved by <hi>flight,</hi> but
all by the Ark alone. And then it is <hi>inconsistent</hi>
with it self too. For how could the Ark drive
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, up the very <hi>tip-top</hi> of a Mountain if
there were no Water upon it; but so much dry
ground, as that many might be saved there, living
together, not only Days, and Weeks; but several
Months, one after another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> likewise and <hi>Cyril</hi> do both recite out of
<hi>Abydenus</hi> the <hi>Assyrian,</hi> how <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the
Ship</hi> (Ark) <hi>in</hi> Armenia, <hi>did out of its Wood afford
Amulets to them that dwelt thereabouts.</hi> But then
the other circumstances of the account are strangely
odd and fabulous. Namely, <hi>That Saturn who reigned
at that time, forewarned</hi> Sisithrus (Noah) <hi>that there
should fall abundance of Rain on the fifteenth of</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius;
<hi>and commanded him to hide what learned
writings he had, in</hi> Heliopolis. <hi>Which,</hi> Sisithrus
<hi>having done, he sailed directly into</hi> Armenia, <hi>and
there quickly found what the GOD had told him,
to be true. But then on the third day after the
Tempest, sending out Birds to try whether they could
see any Land that was not covered with Sea; they
returned again, as not finding any place where they
could rest. After them he sent forth others; and
when he had sent the third time, the Gods took him
away from amongst Men.</hi> Where the absurdities and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:102637:177"/>
incongruities of the Story (if brought home to the
truth of things) are so many, and gross, and obvious;
that time would be perfectly lost, should I spend any
in noting them.</p>
               <p>I pass therefore to <hi>Benjamin</hi> the <hi>Iew,</hi> from whom
I borrow the last citation of this nature. He says
in his <hi>Itinerary,</hi> that the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> rested upon
the Hills of <hi>Ararat;</hi> and that one <hi>Omar,</hi> of the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
of it, built a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Synagogue. But
then he adds that the Prince took it down, <hi>è Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumine
duorum montium, from the top of <hi>two</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi>
And that the Ark should be divided into
<hi>two</hi> parcels, and the remains of it lodg'd upon the
tops of <hi>two</hi> Hills at once; is a passage that gives
but small Credit to the Traveller's Report; but is
enough, methinks, as to this Particular, to call his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
into question.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding therefore what we meet with
in History concerning it, we may lawfully conclude,
that the Ark might not rest upon the <hi>top</hi> of the
<hi>Armenian</hi> Mountains. Only one or two Writers
of note, mistaking <hi>Moses,</hi> it may be, at first; and
telling the World with confidence, That the Ark
rested on the <hi>top</hi> of these Mountains (when he
might mean no more than that it rested <hi>by</hi> them,
or on some <hi>low Ridge</hi> of them) others might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>them,</hi> and others <hi>them</hi> again; and so <hi>all</hi> might
run on in a Track of error, as smoothly as if they
had been in the way of truth. Thus, when
St. <hi>Chrysostom, Epiphanius, Isidore,</hi> and others, tell
that the Ark rested upon the <hi>top</hi> of these Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
and that certain, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>remnants</hi> of it were
to be seen there in <hi>their</hi> days: they were proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
over-rul'd by <hi>History</hi> or <hi>Hearsay;</hi> and so easily
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:102637:177"/>
mis-led by such as went before them. And indeed
that the thing was utterly false, we have great
reason to conclude; when if it were true, it must
either impeach <hi>Scripture,</hi> which (in the sense of all
Men hitherto) taught all-a-long that the Flood
was fifteen Cubits above the tops of the highest
Mountains; and that in the height of this Flood
the Ark rested on the top of <hi>Ararat:</hi> or else clash
with <hi>Geography,</hi> which never allowed the Hills of
<hi>Ararat</hi> to be (by a great deal) the highest: or
else <hi>sink</hi> the Ark quite under Water, to make it <hi>rest</hi>
upon those Hills.</p>
               <p>5. A <hi>Third Objection</hi> may be formed from <hi>the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
of the tops of the Mountains upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the Waters.</hi> So it is recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 5.
That <hi>the waters decreased continually until the tenth
month, and on the first day of the month were the
tops of the mountains seen.</hi> Now if the Mountains
had not been quite under Water, and so invisible for
the time they were overwhelmed; how could they
be said to become visible again, or to be seen upon
the Floods going off?</p>
               <p>In answer to this, we may consider, First, That
by the tops of the Mountains, in Scripture, are
not always meant the <hi>higher,</hi> but sometimes the
<hi>inferior</hi> parts of them. Thus it is prophesied,
<hi>Amos</hi> 1. 2. That <hi>the top of Carmel shall wither.</hi>
Where by <hi>top,</hi> the <hi>sides</hi> or <hi>lower parts</hi> of that Hill
may be intended chiefly. For the withering of
the meer top of it only, would not ('tis like)
have either caused or signified such a scarcity of feed,
as should have occasioned such affliction to Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
as is there foretold; the principal part of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:102637:178"/>
an Hill for Pasture, being usually towards the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of it. So <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 20. it is said, That
<hi>Moses went up to the <hi>top</hi> of mount Sinai.</hi> But that
he did not go up to the <hi>very top</hi> of that Mount
we have great cause to believe, for Two reasons.
<hi>First,</hi> Because <hi>the LORD descended upon it in
fire,</hi> ver. 18. in such a fire as was not only <hi>real,</hi>
but <hi>raging;</hi> for it made the Mountain <hi>smoak as a
furnace.</hi> Yea, it is said, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 17. to be <hi>like
devouring fire on the top of the mount.</hi> And so <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring</hi>
was it, that it seiz'd most terribly upon the
Mountain; insomuch that <hi>it</hi> is said to have <hi>burnt
with fire unto the midst of heaven, Deut.</hi> 4. 11.
But how then could <hi>Moses</hi> go up to the <hi>top</hi> of this
Mountain? Nor, <hi>Secondly,</hi> could he well do it, by
reason of its <hi>height,</hi> and the great <hi>difficulty</hi> of its
<hi>ascent.</hi> For <hi>Iosephus</hi> assures us, That <hi>it is the
highest Hill beyond comparison of all that Country,
and long of its strange height, and its steep inaccessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
craggy Rocks, is not only unfrequented by Men,
but not to be lookt up to, it puts the eye to such
pain.</hi> And yet if <hi>Moses</hi> did not go up to the <hi>top</hi> of
this Hill in <hi>strictness,</hi> we know not how much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it he might present himself. And in case he
stood on any lower ridge or part of that Mount;
it is clear that by the <hi>tops</hi> of high Hills in Scripture,
may be meant but the <hi>lower parts</hi> of the same.
And therefore where we read <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.
15. <hi>from the top of the mountains;</hi> the <hi>Arabic</hi>
reads it, <hi>from the roots</hi> of them. And so by
the tops of the Mountains being seen upon the
drying up of the Flood; will be meant no more,
than that some lower parts of them, not far from
the bottoms, were made bare and expos'd to view
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:102637:178"/>
again, which before were hidden under Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, By the tops of the Mountains, said to
be seen on the first day of the tenth Month; may
be meant, but the tops of some <hi>lower</hi> Mountains,
which were quite overwhelm'd with Water, by its
ascending fifteen Cubits upward upon the highest
parts of the plain of the Earth. If these <hi>two</hi>
Considerations will not satisfie; we must carry on
the Enquiry a little farther, and seek for a <hi>Third.</hi>
And truly some one or other must needs be found
out. For certain it is, that the tops of the highest
Mountains could not be said to be seen, by reason
of the Waters sinking down below them; because,
as we have sufficiently proved, they could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be above them. That is, according to the
common measures Men have taken of the Flood,
and the usual sense they have put upon the sacred
Story of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Therefore (in way of answer to the
Objection) we consider; that the tops of the
Mountains may be said to be seen, at the time menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
upon account of their <hi>emergency out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
not out of the Waters.</hi> Nor let it seem strange,
that at the time of the Flood, there should be
<hi>darkness</hi> over the whole face of the Earth. For
then there was a solution of the continuity of the
<hi>Atmosphaere:</hi> all the vapours almost contained in the
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or comprehension of it, turning into Clouds,
and resolving a great pace into Rains. And as it
is but <hi>reasonable,</hi> to think it was dark then (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the state of the Atmosphaere) so it was
very <hi>requisite</hi> it should be so. For when the Rains
began to fall, and that at such a rate, as to threaten
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:102637:179"/>
in good earnest to make that Deluge which <hi>Noah</hi>
had foretold: this must needs startle and alarm
Men dreadfully. Then, had there been light in
the World, in any good degree; what could have
been expected, but that People who dwelt nearest
to that place where the Ark stood; should have
run directly to it, and rudely assaulting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
it, have turned out <hi>Noah,</hi> his Friends, and
all Creatures; and have taken immediate possession
of it themselves, as the only probable means of their
own preservation. And therefore that the Earth
was then wrapt up in nightsome darkness (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not only <hi>likely</hi> in respect of <hi>Nature,</hi> but <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
in point of <hi>Providence</hi>) we need not fear to
conclude.</p>
               <p>And as it was dark all the time that the Flood
was coming in and waxing; so the Air might
well be very foggy and misty during the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
and decrease of the same. For the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphaere
being put into so great a disorder (and
even dissolution) as it was; it could not quickly
resettle into its wonted clearness.</p>
               <p>And then we must heedfully attend to that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Floods abatement and drying up, which
the HOLY GHOST has given us. <hi>The waters
returned from off the Earth continually,</hi> says he,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 3. Where, the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>returned,</hi> does
often signifie in Scripture, the returning of a thing
into its <hi>Principles.</hi> So <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
return <hi>ye sons of men.</hi> As much as to say, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
into Dust and Spirit, the primigenial parts,
or constituent principles of your Nature. And
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. it is used in the like sense; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>to dust shalt thou <hi>return.</hi>
                  </hi> And <hi>Psal. 146. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:102637:179"/>
he <hi>returneth</hi> to his Earth.</hi> According to which,
where it is said, That <hi>the Waters</hi> returned <hi>from
off the Earth continually;</hi> we are to understand their
continual <hi>version</hi> or return into that <hi>Principle</hi> out
of which they were made; namely, <hi>Vapours.</hi> And the
same is to be understood concerning them, where
it is said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 5. That <hi>the waters decreased con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>They were <hi>going</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing.</hi>
And so the Expression does not denote a
violent <hi>motion</hi> or <hi>agitation</hi> of those Waters (as hath
commonly been thought) so much as a constant
<hi>wasting</hi> or <hi>diminution</hi> of them, by <hi>going quite away.</hi>
And indeed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifies, it <hi>went away:</hi> and as
<note n="*" place="margin">Ad vocabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in Lexic.</note> 
                  <hi>Schindler</hi> notes, is spoken <hi>de rebus evanescentibus,
of things that are vanishing.</hi> Yea, the learned <hi>Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cographer</hi>
brings in this very Passage, as one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of that its signification. Which farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates,
That when the Waters of the Flood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
it was done by their <hi>vanishing</hi> or <hi>going
away</hi> into their first natural <hi>Principle:</hi> by their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning</hi>
or being <hi>converted</hi> into <hi>Vapours.</hi> Now this
being done at a <hi>great rate,</hi> or <hi>very fast</hi> (as we may
gather from so much Water being dried up in so
short a time; and from the miraculous Wind,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 1. sent on purpose to hasten the work, by
helping forward the attenuation of the liquid Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
it must (in likelihood) overcast and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
the Air; and so conspissate and obscure it, as
to render things invisible at a little distance from
the beholder's Eye. Whence it will follow, That
when the tops of the Mountains were seen, this
might come to pass, not by the Waters sinking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
those tops (whither they never ascended) but
by the clearing up of the Sky, and the wearing
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:102637:180"/>
off of its unusual thickness and fogginess. And yet
this their <hi>visibility</hi> or <hi>new appearance</hi> might proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be ascrib'd to the decrease of the Waters too:
inasmuch as till they were so diminisht, as not to
afford Vapours enough, to thicken and darken the
Air any longer, at the rate they had done; the
Mountains tops could not be seen.</p>
               <p>Should it here be objected, That according to
this way of explaining their appearance, they could
not have been seen so soon as in the tenth Month;
because the Waters were then upon the Earth in
great abundance: that Objection might be thus
taken off. Though there were <hi>waters</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 8. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>upon the
face of the whole earth</hi> then; yea, and<note n="†" place="margin">Ver. 6.</note> forty days
after that (which was the reason why <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove
could find no rest) yet these Waters were so far
exhaled, drawn so low, and grown so gross and
muddy; that now they did not <hi>return</hi> or <hi>go away</hi>
into vapours, half so fast as before. The Atmosphaere
also was now come pretty well to its old consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
again; and so the attractive power of the Sun
was much damped and weakened, and he did not draw
vapours so briskly and plentifully as he had done.
And yet the lower Regions of the Air might be
very thick and foggy still; so that the Mountains
might not be seen by looking right on, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by looking upward. And so the highest parts
of the Mountains, that by thrusting up aloft did
intercept the lightsomeness of the glimmering Skie,
and terminate the eye-sight; might by that means
be discerned. And therefore indeed only the <hi>tops</hi>
of them were said to be seen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:102637:180"/>
Nor let it be thought a meer phancy, a whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
groundless Figment of ours, that the Waters
of the Deluge did decrease in this manner. I mean
by <hi>going</hi> or returning into Vapours, and that at such
a rate, as to fill the Air, for a time, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Mists, and make it very caliginous and dark.
This is so far from being an empty fiction or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit;
that I may venture to say, It was a necessary
<hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> For when the Earth was so general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drown'd, the Water being of a smooth Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies,
if the <hi>Air</hi> had been clear, yea, if it had not
been more than ordinarily thick, it would certainly
have been most exceeding cold. Even as cold as
it is now in its middle Region, where Icy Meteors
are continually floating. So that in the Natural
Course of things, the Waters of the Flood would
presently have been frozen extreamly hard. And
if we can suppose they should ever have been
melted again (as by the force of meer Nature they
hardly could) yet they could not have been so in that
space of time, wherein the Deluge went off, and the
Earth became dry.</p>
               <p>And that a vehement Frost would have seiz'd
the Waters of the Flood, as soon as they were
come down (if the Air had not been strangely
thick) is but reasonable to conclude upon <hi>this</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
Because the Atmosphaere was never so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
of Vapours; and so never so thin; and so
never so sharp and terribly cold, since the World
began; as it was at that time.</p>
               <p>And then lastly, that the closeness and thickness
of the Air was such, as to darken and benight
the whole Earth at once; may fairly be inferred
from <hi>Gen. 8. ult.</hi> For there GOD promiseth that
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:102637:181"/>
while the Earth remaineth, there shall be <hi>day,</hi> as
will as <hi>seed-time,</hi> and <hi>harvest.</hi> Implying, That
during the Flood, there was as perfect an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of <hi>day</hi> upon Earth, as there was of <hi>seed-time,</hi>
and <hi>harvest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. A <hi>Fourth Objection</hi> may be framed from the
<hi>Possibility and easiness of Mens escaping the Flood.</hi>
For if the Waters prevailed but fifteen Cubits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
upon the Plain of the Earth; and the tops
of the spacious aspiring Mountains stood bare (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
a little of the lower parts of them) all
the time of the Deluge: how easily might Men
have run up those Mountains, and so have been
saved from the violence of the Waters? and then
what need of an Ark to preserve them.</p>
               <p>To this it may be answered. For People to ascend
these high Mountains, when the Flood was coming
in; could be no such easie matter. For at what
rate soever the Rains descended in other places; it
is not to be doubted but they fell in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
about the lofty Mountains. For the pitchy,
swollen, loaden Clouds, which then hung every
where bagging in the Air; driving and crouding,
and squeezing against those Mountains, could not
but empty themselves there (like full Spunges when
pressed or nipped) in prodigious Showres, that
would have run down in furious and mighty Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
Yea, 'tis more than probable, that these
squeezed Clouds, would not only have discharged
themselves in immoderate Showres thereabouts; but
in kind of <hi>Ecnephiae,</hi> or <hi>Exhydyriae.</hi> (such as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fall in the <hi>Pacific</hi> Ocean) very terrible Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests;
wherein Rain pours down as it were out of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:102637:181"/>
Spouts or Buckets, and falls in whole Sheets of
Water at once. So that the sides of the Hills would
have been full of Cataracts, and the Waters would
have come roaring and gulling down them so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly,
that no living Creatures would have been
able to stand, much less to climb up against them.
And then the higher sort of Mountains, as the
<hi>Alpes,</hi> and the like, being covered with huge quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Snow; that would have melted a great
pace too, and contributed to the dreadful Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
we speak of. And then the Waters of the
<hi>Great Deep,</hi> being no other (as we suppose) than
such as flowed out of the <hi>Caverns</hi> of high Rocks
and Mountains, when the power of Heaven had
broke them up: these also would have augmented
the mighty De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>luxions, and made them more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and irresistable. And this was one main end
of GOD's breaking up those Fountains; even to
increase the Downfals of Water off the Mountains,
and to make them so copious and fierce, as that
Men might not be able to ascend the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
And truly for them to have fled to the
Mountains to be saved from the Flood, down
which such impetuous Streams came rolling and
roaring in most hedious sort: would have been like
plunging themselves into the Sea, to prevent
drowning.</p>
               <p>And truly if any Houses, Towns, or Cities,
stood so high upon Mountains, as to be above
the Water-mark of the Flood: yet the aforesaid
Downfals of Water, would have ruined them all.
Or if any could have supported themselves by their
great strength, the Inhabitants would still have
been drowned in them. Which might be one
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:102637:182"/>
main Reason, why GOD appointed <hi>Noah</hi> to build
an <hi>Ark</hi> (and not an <hi>House,</hi> or a <hi>Castle</hi> upon any
high Mountains) to save himself, and such other
Creatures as were to be preserved.</p>
               <p>7. A <hi>Fifth Objection</hi> may be drawn from <hi>the
likelihood of some other Animals escaping the Flood.</hi>
That is, such as lived <hi>within</hi> the Earth, in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and undrowned parts of the Mountains. For
however they could not get up on the Hills, or
if they had been upon them, could not have har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
there; but must have been washed down
into the common Gulf that swallow'd all: yet
having their aboad <hi>under ground,</hi> and perhaps a
<hi>good depth</hi> under it too; they might be secure in
their subterraneous Dwellings. For though the
Waters fell in great plenty, and with as great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence;
yet shedding off the Mountains apace, and
hasting downward swiftly; they could not soak so
far into the Earth, as to incommode, much less destroy
the Creatures there lodg'd, and so well intrencht
and fortified against them. The Consequence would
be no less, than that <hi>Moses</hi> must faulter in what
he relates; That <hi>every living substance was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
Gen. 7. 23.</p>
               <p>I answer. Where the Historian tells <hi>this,</hi> that
every living substance was destroyed; he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
puts a restriction or plain limitation upon it;
adding <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>which was upon the face
of the ground.</hi> So that if any creatures were so
deep <hi>under ground,</hi> as to continue alive and safe,
notwithstanding the Deluge: this would be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
or repugnancy to the Inspired Writer.
For still <hi>every living substance</hi> might be destroyed
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:102637:182"/>
which was <hi>upon the face</hi> of the Ground: and that
was as much as he affirmed.</p>
               <p>Lest that Answer should not satisfie, let me put
in another. The Waters falling so plentifully and
violently on the Mountains; where they could not
soak in, and drown the Creatures earthed in them;
by their continued beating and running upon the
Ground for forty days together, they did either so
settle it, that it squeezed them to death: or else so
stop up the pores of it, that they were smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
               <p>8. A <hi>Sixth Objection</hi> may be taken from <hi>the
Quantity of Waters as like to exceed very much</hi> (some
may imagine) even so as to surmount our <hi>supposed
limit.</hi> For they that issued from the Fountains of
the Great Deeps, joined with those that fell in the
forty days; must needs have raised a Flood much
higher than fifteen Cubits above the Plain of the
Earth.</p>
               <p>But the answer says, No. For besides the huge
deal of Water which the Earth drank up (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in its sandy Regions) before its thirst could
be quenched; and the vast deal that sank into its
invisible hollownesses, before they could be filled;
and the abundance that was absorpt by its numberless
pits and capacious valleys, before they could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenisht,
and the Water brought to a level: And
besides how much it then took up, to raise the
Flood <hi>one</hi> Cubit around the Globe, as well upon
the Sea, as dry Land; and how much more to
raise a <hi>second</hi> Cubit, than the first (the higher cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
being still the larger;) and how much
more to raise a <hi>third</hi> Cubit, than the Second; and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:102637:183"/>
so on till the fifteen Cubits were full: Besides all
this, I say, the Rains by which the Deluge was
<hi>chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fly</hi> caused, might not descend at any <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
rate</hi> of violence. For however about the
Mountains, they might be monstrous and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
yet every where else they might be quite
otherwise: and the immensity and destructiveness
of the Waters they raised, may be imputed to the
generality and duration of them, rather than to
their excessive greatness. We are told indeed,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 11. That the <hi>cataracts</hi> or <hi>windows of heaven
were opened.</hi> Yet that might betoken nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
in the Rains, save their <hi>continuance.</hi>
For <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 10. GOD promiseth his People (as
a signal mercy) to <hi>open</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>the cataracts</hi> or
<hi>windows of heaven</hi> for them. And what does the
Expression there import? Why, no more than that
he would send such moderate Rains, as should
make their grounds fruitful. So says <hi>Lyra;</hi> GOD
opened the Cataracts of Heaven,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>by giving rains

And if <hi>the opening of the cataracts of heaven,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys
but an ordinary descent, or moderate down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
of gentle fructifying Rains and Dews: then
notwithstanding these Cataracts were opened at
the Flood, the Rains might then in most places distill,
with a wonted gentleness and moderation. Which
granted, there would be no danger of their swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Flood above that height to which our
Supposition limits it. And though according to
<hi>Marsennus</hi>'s account, forty days Rain might raise
the Waters an hundred and fifty Feet: yet who
can tell whether the Rains fell so fast in those forty
days; as they did at the time, and place, when,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:102637:183"/>
and where, he made his Experiment and Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?
Others I am sure are of the mind (and
<hi>Osiander</hi> for one) that they were only sufficient to
set the Ark afloat. And they quote that Passage
for it, <hi>Gen. 7. 17. The flood was forty days upon the
Earth: and the waters increased, and bare up the Ark,
and it was lifted up above the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. A <hi>Seventh Objection</hi> may be made from <hi>the
Raven which</hi> Noah <hi>sent out of the Ark,</hi> Gen. 8. 7.
It is there said, That <hi>that</hi> Raven <hi>went forth to and
fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth.</hi>
Whence some conclude, That he was forced to return
into the Ark again and again, still as he went out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by reason of the Waters, there was no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
place of abode for him abroad. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
they infer, That the Waters which were
so high <hi>then,</hi> could not but cover the tops of the
Mountains, when they were at their full height.
To this it might be answered,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That if the Raven <hi>did return,</hi> this does not
argue that the Waters were then at such a <hi>mighty
height</hi> (and so that they had been higher than the
<hi>loftiest</hi> Hills) because it is said, That he <hi>went to and
fro</hi> (that is, to and from the Ark, as our Objectors
would have it) <hi>until the waters were dried up.</hi> So
that his <hi>returning</hi> was not occasioned by the excess
of Waters, not suffering him to remain at large;
nor does it prove them to have been so excessive as
they would make them. For even when they were
<hi>abated,</hi> and so abated that the tops of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
were seen (ver. 5.) where he might have had
both <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>prey;</hi> still (according to the <hi>Hebrew
Phrase</hi>) he was <hi>going and returning</hi> from and to the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:102637:184"/>
Ark. Yea, he continued to do thus <hi>all-a-long,</hi> even
<hi>untill the waters were dried up from off the earth.</hi>
Which makes it plain, that as the excess of the
Waters could not be the cause of his returning to the
Ark; so his continual returning could not argue the
Waters to be so excessive: inasmuch as he never ceased
returning, till the Waters were quite dried up. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I answer. The Raven in likelihood
returned not at all. And therefore the <hi>Vulgar</hi> is
positive in the case; <hi>egrediebatur &amp; non revertebatur;
he went out, and did not return.</hi> And so is the
<hi>Septuagint;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And <hi>Bochart</hi> says,
That if the <hi>Negation</hi> be taken out of the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Text, there will be no sense in it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he thinks that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ought to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
putting the <hi>Future</hi> Tense for the <hi>Praeterperfect.</hi> And
then the Raven for certain did never return to
<hi>Noah.</hi> And the <hi>Arabian</hi> Proverb intimates as much,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he <hi>stays as long as</hi> Noah<hi>'s Crow.</hi>
To which the <hi>Latin</hi> one is near akin, <hi>Corvus nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius:</hi>
Or, <hi>Corvum misimus.</hi> So that the Objection
<hi>against</hi> us, will at last be a piece of an Argument
<hi>for</hi> us. So far, that is, as the Raven's not coming
home again, after he was sent out; shows the
Waters were low: and that he had Food enough to
live upon, and Room enough to fly up and down in
from place to place; which might be that <hi>going and
returning of</hi> his, mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Dove which was sent out after, <hi>found
no rest for the sole of her foot, and</hi> therefore <hi>she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to Noah into the ark,</hi> verse 9. And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
For though the Waters were much abated, yet
still they were <hi>on the face of the whole earth,</hi> covering
its Superficies in most places. And the Dove being a
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:102637:184"/>
more nice and tender Creature than the Crow;
might want proper Food and a warm Roost, and
for the sake of these, be glad to fly back to the
Ark where it had found both. And therefore the
second time that it was sent forth, it returned not
till the <hi>evening;</hi> that is, till the coolness of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
night, made it sensible of the want of a
convenient Lodging. And for the same reasons
(especially it being a tamish Bird) it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
have come back to <hi>Noah,</hi> when he sent it out
last: only the Earth and Air being now grown
more dry, and warm, and pleasant; probably it was
tempted to fly so far from the Ark, as not to be
able to find the way to it again. Yet its not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
might be <hi>really</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> what he took it
to be; a sign that the Waters were dried up.</p>
               <p>10. An <hi>Eighth Objection</hi> may be <hi>the Danger the
Ark would have been in, of being stav'd or wrackt.</hi>
For if during the Flood, the tops of the great
Hills had been all above Water; how easily might
the Ark have run aground, and have been broken
and shattered all to pieces?</p>
               <p>It may be answered thus, The great Deluge from
the Beginning to the End of it, was in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
a <hi>miraculous</hi> work. Yea, even where GOD
was pleased to make <hi>Nature</hi> his Instrument; He
took her, as I may say, into his own hand, and
wielded her by his own Omnipotent Arm; and so
inabled her to do, what in her own way, and by
her own strength, she could never have effected.
Look into the inspired Story, and what a great deal
of miracle shall we see, in the very Praelusories or
preparatives to that mighty Inundation?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:102637:185"/>
Thus, as GOD preacquainted the Patriarch
<hi>Noah,</hi> with his design of bringing it in; so he
ordered him to build an Ark against it came, to
save himself and his Family, from that fearful ruine
which was to attend it. He directed him of
what Timber to make it, and of what Dimensions;
how to frame it without, and to fashion it within:
and the whole Vessel seems to have been all of his
wise contriving. Such Creatures also as were to
be kept alive for future propagation, he appointed
<hi>Noah</hi> to admit into this Ark; inclining them at the
same time, to come in their several species, and
offer themselves to him. For as the Father says;
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Non ea</hi> Noe <hi>capta intromit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

scilicet hominis actu, sed Dei nutu. Not by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of man, that is to say, but by the disposition of
GOD.</hi> And as he injoined <hi>Noah</hi> to receive these
Animals into the Ark, and harbour them there; so
likewise to provide sustenance for them, instructing
him as to the quality and quantity of the
same. So says the same Father.<note n="a" place="margin">Quid mirum si vir ille sapiens &amp; justus, etiam divinitus admonitus, quid cuique congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eret; aptam cuiqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and lay up sutable nourishment to every
kind?</hi> And to the end he might have all in a due
readiness against the time, GOD gave him a <hi>weeks</hi>
notice, just before the irruption of the fatal Waters,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 4. And lastly, when the good Man and his
Relatives entred the Ark (whose <hi>Cargo</hi> was such, as no
single Ship, nor the mightiest Fleet could ever boast
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:102637:185"/>
of, though the Sea it navigated was as wonderful,
as its Lading) the LORD himself is said to
<hi>shut them in,</hi> Gen. 7. 16. That is, by the Ministry
of his Holy Angels.</p>
               <p>And when the ALMIGHTY was thus <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously</hi>
ingag'd in ordering the <hi>Preparatives</hi> to the
Flood; we may be sure it was no less concern'd
in bringing in the Flood it self. And therefore
GOD openly proclaims it to be his own Fact, and
challenges and appropriates it to himself alone, as
peculiarly belonging to his Providential Efficience,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 17. and 7. 4. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
That <hi>GOD brought in the flood upon the
world,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 5. Where (upon view of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text)
it will appear, that the Apostle makes the
bringing in of the Flood, to be as much GOD's
Work, as ever it was to cast the sinning Angels
down to Hell, to save <hi>Noah;</hi> to burn <hi>Sodom;</hi> or
to deliver <hi>Lot:</hi> all which were undeniably immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and miraculous Acts of his. And truly that
the Windows of Heaven should be opened; and
all the Fountains of the Great Deep broke up: that
they should be opened and broke up on the same
day: that they should be so opened and broke up,
as to yield such a quantity of Water at that time,
as they never did before, and never did since, and
never shall do again: what could this be but a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
and wonderful Work of GOD?</p>
               <p>I might farther observe the like miraculous workings
of the DEITY, in <hi>shutting up</hi> those Windows of
Heaven again; and in <hi>stopping</hi> the aforesaid Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Deep; and in <hi>drying up</hi> the Waters of
the Deluge so fast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I wave that (as I have
done other things) to avoid prolixity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:102637:186"/>
Now when the Flood in all the periods of it, was
thus disposed and govern'd by an Omnipotent and
<hi>Miraculous</hi> hand; that the same hand should at once
defend and direct the Ark; and so guard and steer
it, as to keep it from Ship-wrack: is not at all to
be wondred at. We may rather wonder, and
wonder very much, if any should think otherwise.</p>
               <p>To which add, That a miraculous protection
and care of the Ark, would have been altogether
as necessary, according to the <hi>Theory,</hi> or the <hi>Old
Hypothesis.</hi> For, according to the <hi>Theory,</hi> the Ark
must have sunk as low as the falling Earth; and
then have been thrown up higher than the highest
Mountains; and have been toss'd with such terrible
and hideous jactations, as that the worst which are
suffered on the roughest Seas, would scarce be
shadows to them. So that unless a miraculous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
superintended it, how could it be safe?
And therefore indeed the <hi>Theory</hi> represents it, with
its Guardian Angels about it, in the extremity of the
Flood. And then according to the <hi>Old way,</hi> the
tops of the Mountains must have been above Water,
all the time that the Deluge was waxing. And so
without such a Providence again, the Ark would have
been as much imperill'd by those Mountains (if not
more) as if they had been drown'd no deeper than
<hi>we</hi> suppose them. Yea, in that very juncture when
the Flood (according to the common account) was at
its highest; the Ark <hi>struck</hi> upon the Mountains of
<hi>Ararat,</hi> and was <hi>stranded</hi> there. And to save it in
such circumstances, a most miraculous Providence was
necessary indeed. But then the same may as lawfully
be challenged <hi>by,</hi> and ought as readily to be allowed
<hi>to, our</hi> Hypothesis likewise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:102637:186"/>
11. Which grant; and then if in this memorable
Flood, any difficulties be started, that Men are
puzzled to make out: any <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> arise, that
are too big to proceed from <hi>Nature</hi> alone; and too
intricate to be understood by <hi>Reason:</hi> lo, here's a
<hi>general</hi> Answer to them, if not solution of them.
The Flood was a <hi>Miracle</hi> in good measure. Or
had so much miracle running through it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven
with it; that all passages in it, are not
to be accounted for by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Philosophy.</hi> And
truly where <hi>Nature</hi> was over-ruled by <hi>Providence;</hi>
it is but fit that <hi>Philosophy</hi> should give place to
<hi>Omnipotence:</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> sway out Minds to assent
to those things, which <hi>Reason</hi> is unable to apprehend
and explicate.</p>

as is seldom found in a new <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> especially at
its first setting up, and sallying out into the

               <p>2. This <hi>Positiveness</hi> is very apparent, both in
the <hi>Latin,</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Editions of the <hi>Theory.</hi> But
I shall observe it only in the <hi>latter;</hi> that coming
out <hi>after</hi> the other, and so with more deliberation
and mature thoughts of things. It there discovers
it self in such Passages as these:</p>
               <p>I am willing to add here a Chapter or two, to
shew that what we have delivered is <hi>more than an
Idea,</hi> and that it was <hi>in this very way</hi> that <hi>Noah</hi>'s
Deluge came to pass, <hi>pag.</hi> 79.</p>
               <p>As we do not think it an unhappy discovery to
have found out <hi>(with a moral certainty)</hi> the seat
of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Abyss,—so this gives us
<hi>a great assurance,</hi> that the Theory we have given
of a general Deluge, <hi>is not a meer Idea,</hi> but <hi>is to

That our Description <hi>is a reality,</hi> both as to the
Antediluvian Earth, and as to the Deluge, we may
farther be <hi>convinc'd</hi> from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Discourse,
<hi>pag.</hi> 85.</p>
               <p>We may <hi>safely conclude</hi> that this <hi>is no imaginary

               <p>If they (the ancient Earth and Abyss) were

without any sufficient ground, or any just

is something more than Positiveness in this clause;
which occurs, <hi>pag.</hi> 93.</p>
               <p>We have <hi>proved</hi> our Explication of the Deluge
to be <hi>more than an Idea,</hi> or to be <hi>a true piece of

               <p>I confess, for my own part, when I observe
how easily and naturally this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

               <p>To speak the truth, this Theory is <hi>something

               <p>
                  <hi>It will never be beaten out of my head,</hi> but that

               <p>These are the Vitals of the <hi>Theory,</hi> and the
Primary Assertions whereof I do <hi>freely profess my
full belief,</hi> pag. 288.</p>
               <p>Now I confess, I should have been much at a
loss, whither to impute such extraordinary positive
confidence, as shows it self (by these excerptions)
in a Man so ingenious, touching things so precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
had he not told me in this <hi>Maxim</hi> of his
own: <hi>A strong inclination, with a little evidence,
is equivalent to a strong evidence,</hi> pag. 297. Which
considered; we need not wonder that strong Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
should sometimes be built upon weak
grounds. Or to speak it in the <hi>Theorists</hi> next
words; <hi>we are not to be surprised, if we find Men
confident in their Opinions many times far beyond the
degree of their evidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Yet that his Intentions, in conposing and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
his Book, were good and laudable; we have
no reason to doubt. His own Declaration speaks
them so. <hi>I have no other design than to contribute
my endeavours to find out the truth in a subject of so
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:102637:188"/>
great importance, and wherein the World hath hitherto
had so little Satisfaction,</hi> pag. 97. A noble aim;
but he that would cleverly hit the mark, must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of shooting through S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ripture, and wounding
it at the rate the <hi>Theorist</hi> has done.</p>
               <p>4. To Conclude. If so be, sincere and upright
Intentions will justifie the failures of a Pen, and
in any measure serve to extenuate or excuse them;
I can take up that Plea in behalf of mine. And
whereas in the new Explication of the Deluge, I may
seem to have run out into a kind of <hi>lax</hi> interpretation
of one or two Texts of Holy Scripture; I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
apologiz'd for that excursion already, by
owning that (besides it is necessary to expound those
Scriptures a new way, upon the account of the old
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the Flood) it was made but to vie with
the <hi>Theory;</hi> and to try if we could hit upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way of explaining the Deluge that might pass
for <hi>rational</hi> and intelligible. And therefore I only
add this, which I do most heartily, I had rather,
much rather my Papers should be burnt to Ashes, and
my self with them; than that I should knowingly
and wilfully write any thing, in way of opposition
<hi>to,</hi> depravation <hi>of,</hi> or derogation <hi>from,</hi> any Divine
Truth.</p>
