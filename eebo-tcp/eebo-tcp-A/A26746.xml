            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>WHen I firſt met with theſe <hi>Socinian</hi> Letters, and found that words, and fallacy were their whole compoſition; I could not but think them ſo unlike their Patrons, or their Patrons ſo unlike the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter they affect, which is to be men of Wit and Reaſon, that I Judged them not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy an anſwer. But ſince it appears that theſe, like ſome other the worſt things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, do not want their admirers, I thought this performance my duty.</p>
            <p>In it I have anſwered not only the firſt of theſe letters, but divers parts of the reſt, as well as ſome things in more manly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as Eriedinus, Crellius, &amp;c. By calling in the other letters to aſiſt this, and other <hi>Socinian</hi> authors, to ſupply the weakneſs of them all, I put the Objections, in their full ſtrength, to the end their overthrow may be the more conſpicuos to the world, and the more ſenſible to themſelves. If they venture
<pb facs="tcp:59259:4"/>
upon argument, and do any thing, that affects the cauſe, I am ready to ſupport it, But if they only load me with words, and cavils, I muſt neglect them.</p>
            <p>If theſe labours are ſuccesful in recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any, whom this Hereſy hath infected, and in preſerving thoſe, who yet are whole; and hereby in giving any check to the growing errors, and prophaneſs of the age, I ſhall place the time ſpent upon this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among my happy minutes. That it may be productive of ſuch bleſſed effects, was the hope, and deſign, and ſhall be the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THat term <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian]</hi> is put as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between them and us: take it as it ſignifies him, who believes one only God, excluſive of all others;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59259:5"/>
and then it makes a diſtinction without a difference; for we are as intirely in that Faith, as the <hi>Socinian</hi> can be: but as they make it ſignify one, who believes the Father only to be God, excluſive of the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it a term ſuitable to theſe Letters, <hi>i. e.</hi> full of <hi>Error,</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59259:5"/>
perſwaſion; ſince their Hereſy is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not upon Scripture, but upon thoſe falſe Gloſſes, and Sophiſtical Evaſions, which make the Scriptures of none effect.</p>
               <p>The Preamble to the Letter pretends, that his Friend demands an account of the<hi> Socinians. Their Doctrine concerning God (in which only they differ from other Chriſtians) the </hi>Remonſtrants<hi> profeſſedly agreeing with them in other points of Faith, and Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Their Doctrine concerning God is, That the <hi>Father only is God;</hi> P. 4. But that they differ from other Chriſtians in other points beſide this, is notorious to the world.</p>
               <p>They own the <hi>Arians</hi> to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> becauſe they agree with themſelves in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; P. 33. But the <hi>Arians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the Son the Creation of the World, while the <hi>Socinians</hi> deny his Exiſtence before the Incarnation: Therefore either the <hi>Arians</hi> are no Chriſtians, or the <hi>Socinians</hi> differ from other Chriſtians in other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines beſides this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59259:6"/>
But he would prove that in other points the <hi>Socinians</hi> agree with other Chriſtians, becauſe in other points they agree with the <hi>Remonſtrants:</hi> Which implyes,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves, and the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants,</hi> but this; which is well known to be falſe, And</p>
               <p n="2">2. That themſelves, and <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> are all the Chriſtians in the World: Becauſe he makes it, that their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with theſe doth prove their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with other Chriſtians; but this is falſe too: Becauſe theſe <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants</hi> were condemned by the Synod at <hi>Dort</hi> about the five Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>You have then a double falſhood in the compaſs of this one Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis; the one in inlarging the number of his Friends; the other in leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the number of his Errors. The deſign of which muſt be to perſwade the Reader, That there is but one ſtep between the Orthodox Faith, and this Hereſy, to the end he may the more eaſily decoy 'em into it.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59259:6"/>
According to this beginning you muſt expect but little, if any truth, and honeſty in this Letter, which we ſhall now conſider.</p>

So the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers taught, That the Son is <hi>God of God,</hi> that is, God of, and from the Father; but yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all aſſerted, That he is of the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the Father; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is God, as the Father is. And indeed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59259:7"/>
this Subordination cannot deſtroy his Divinity, becauſe it doth not deſtroy his Nature: For the Inequality ariſes not from the Eſſence, but from the order, and manner of ſubſiſtence. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. In other reſpects the Son is equal to the Father; this the Apoſtle aſſerts, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not Robbery to be equal with God, viz.</hi> the Father. Now if he thought it no robbery, it could be no robbery; and if no robbery, he muſt be equal; and if equal, he muſt be God by Nature, as the Father is.</p>
               <p>This leads to the true ſence of thoſe words [<hi>Being in the Form of God</hi>] for though <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of it ſelf ſtrictly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies not Subſtance, ſo much as Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; not ſo much the Nature, as the Appearance of things; whence <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and the <hi>Socinians,</hi> would have theſe words to ſignifie, not that he is God, but that he was like to God. yet however the Apoſtle muſt here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it Subſtantially: that is, his being in the <hi>Form of God,</hi> muſt ſignifie that he is God; as his being in the <hi>Form of a</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59259:8"/>
                  <hi>Servant,</hi> ſignifies, that he was a Servant: And the Reaſon is, becauſe his equality with God is here inferred from his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Form of God;</hi> but there cannot be an equality between a thing, and the mere likeneſs of it; between a real Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a bare ſimilitude. Whence <hi>Eraſmus</hi> underſtood the force of the Word, but not the reach of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Argument.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Eraſmus</hi> doth not deny the Divinity of the Son, yet becauſe he thinks this Text doth not reſpect his Nature; I ſhall therefore oppoſe to his ſence the Judgment of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; as <hi>Arnob. &amp; Serap. conflic. l.</hi> 2. <hi>Novat. de Trin. c.</hi> 17. <hi>Hilar. Pict. Epiſt. de Trin. l.</hi> 8. &amp; 10. <hi>Greg. Nyſ. tom.</hi> 2 <hi>cont. Eunom. Ora.</hi> 7. &amp;c. Which Judgment of theirs I ſhall confirm by theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. By the matter of the Apoſtle's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, he was in the <hi>Form of God,</hi> and in the <hi>Form of a Servant.</hi> If this Text ſpeaks him not God, but like to God; it muſt alſo ſpeak him not a Servant, but like to a Servant: But that he was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59259:8"/>
a Servant he ſaith himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>I came to miniſter;</hi> and therefore he muſt be God; becauſe the ſame Phraſe, and Senſe applyed to each Nature, muſt import the reality of the one, as well as of the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The order of the parts ſpeaks our ſenſe: For <hi>being in the form of God, i. e.</hi> While he was in the form of God, <hi>he took upon him the form of a Servant:</hi> therefore that form was before this. But there was no ſuch difference in the parts of his Life, or Condition upon Earth, that one ſhould merit to be called the <hi>form of God,</hi> the other the <hi>form of a Servant:</hi> Therefore his being in the form of God muſt be antecedent to his humane Life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This was his choice, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Act, for he <hi>took upon him</hi> the form of a Servant: But he had no liberty of choice in this world; becauſe his condition here was determined and foretold; whence himſelf ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 44. <hi>That all things muſt be fulfilled, which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and in the Pſalms, concerning me;</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59259:9"/>
therefore this choice was before this life; and conſequently muſt be the Act of the Divine, not of the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So evidently doth this Text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Nature of Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declare him to be equal to God the Father, as being God by Nature, as the Father is.</p>
               <p>This Equality our Saviour himſelf doth prove, <hi>Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 5. 17. <hi>My Father works hitherto, and I work:</hi> whence the <hi>Jews</hi> concluded <hi>v.</hi> 18. that he made himſelf <hi>equal to God:</hi> Upon which he doth not explain himſelf, as if they miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him; which he did in the caſe of <hi>eating his fleſh,</hi> and <hi>drinking his blood:</hi> But <hi>v.</hi> 19. he proves this equality, <hi>what things ſoever the Father doth, theſe</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] the very ſame, <hi>the Son doth likewiſe.</hi> Whence he muſt be equal to the Father in Operation, and conſequently in Power. So <hi>Ambroſe de fid. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 13. and <hi>Greg. Naz. Orat.</hi> 36.</p>
               <p>Hence he requires <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father;</hi> which imports an equality of Honour flowing from an equality of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59259:9"/>
Operation; for the reaſon of the duty inſtructs us in the nature of the duty it ſelf. This Honour is owing from their works, but they both do the ſame works, therefore they muſt both have the ſame Honour.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 30. <hi>I, and my Father are one;</hi> that is, not in concord only, as the <hi>Socinian</hi> pretends, but in power: Becauſe the context ſpeaks not of Wills and Affections, but of <hi>keeping his ſheep: none ſhall pluck them out of my hands;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hands;</hi> for which he gives this reaſon, <hi>I, and my Father are one:</hi> which muſt be one in power. And if they be one in power, they muſt be one in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; unleſs you make an Almighty Creature, which is not only an abſolute contradiction, but alſo confounds the eſſential properties of God, and the Creature; which is a much viler Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, than they can with any ſhadows of Reaſon pretend againſt our Doctrine.</p>
               <p>That gloſs then of <hi>Athanaſius cont. Ari. Orat.</hi> 4. muſt be admitted, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59259:10"/>
This ſhows <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the ſameneſs of the God-head, and the Unity of Power. For indeed the abſcribing to the Son the ſame Infinite Perfections, and the ſame Honour, but not the ſame Nature with the Father, as the <hi>Socinian</hi> doth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims not only the perverſeneſs of the Diſputant, but the Idolatry of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors too.</p>
               <p>In that caſe of his being the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> he ſends Men to his works, whoſe Nature, and agreeableneſs to ancient Prophecies, do ſufficiently declare the point. So here he firſt aſſerts his equality with the Father, then improves it to an Unity in Power, and Honour; and then leaves men to conclude from thence an Unity of Nature. This is the moſt rational way of teaching; for poſitive affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tell us things <hi>are ſo;</hi> but Natural, and neceſſary conſequences, ſuch as theſe are, prove they muſt be ſo. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the Father is greater than the Son, as the Father is of himſelf, and is God only; while the Son is of the Father, and is both God and Man; yet
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59259:10"/>
the Son is equal to, nay, <hi>One</hi> with the Father in Operation; and if in Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then in Power; and if in Power, then in Nature: and therefore muſt be God.</p>
               <p>He proceeds <hi>p.</hi> 5. to manage this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 17. <hi>I aſcend to my God, and your God:</hi> whence he fancies, the Son is not God, becauſe another is his God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As Chriſt is Man, and we his Brethren, ſo our God is his God: This proves that he is Man, but cannot prove, he is not himſelf God, which is the deſign of this Letter. Nay, as the Son is <hi>God of God, i. e.</hi> God the Son of, and from God the Father, ſo the Father may be his God, as well as his Father; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weakning the Doctrine of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. So far is this Text from conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Point, that it makes nothing againſt us.</p>
               <p>He adds, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 49. <hi>The Father, which ſent me, he gave me a Commandment:</hi> The Argument is, the Son is not God, becauſe the Father commands, and ſends him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This hath been anſwered alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59259:11"/>
For in what reſpects the Father is greater than the Son, in the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Father may command, and ſend the Son: But as the Father's being greater than the Son, doth not deſtroy the Divinity of the Son, becauſe (as before) it doth not deſtroy his Nature; ſo neither can his commanding and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; becauſe this Power flows as a right, or conſequence from his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, And if the Father's Superiority it ſelf cannot deſtroy the Son's Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that Power, which is implyed, or wrapt up in the very Nature of that Superiority, can never do it.</p>

                  <hi>Arg. </hi>2. P. 5, 6.<hi> If Chriſt were God, he could not be the Creature of God: </hi>But that he is the Creature of God, he would ſain prove from two Scriptures; the former is<hi> Heb. </hi>3. 1, 2.<hi> The High-Prieſt of our Profeſſion Jeſus Chriſt, who was faithful to him, that appointed him: </hi>In the Greek, and in the Margin it is,<hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him that made him.</hi>

               <p>

him to that Office. In this ſence we uſe the Phraſe of making a Biſhop. Yet this (it ſeems) is a <hi>Socinian</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>His other Text is, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 15. which calls him the <hi>Firſt-born of every Creature:</hi> whence he would have him to be but a Creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is the Firſt-born of every Creature not in kind as one of them, but in regard of an Exiſtence prior to them: Whence <hi>V.</hi> 17.

And both this Apoſtle and the Evangeliſt with one conſent declare him not a Creature himſelf, but the Maker of all Creatures, for <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>By him were all things created:</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>By him were all things made.</hi> This drives the <hi>Socinian</hi> to three moſt pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable falſhoods, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They grant us, P. 130. that <hi>V.</hi> 15. which runs thus; the <hi>Image of the Inviſible God,</hi> and <hi>the Firſt-Born of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature,</hi> is ſpoke of Chriſt: And conſequently, <hi>V.</hi> 16. muſt be ſpoke of him too; becauſe that word [him] by him <hi>were all things created,</hi> cannot poſſibly have any other Antecedent, than <hi>the Image of the Inviſible God, and the Firſt-born of every Creature;</hi> whence immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follows this, 16 <hi>V.

               </p>
               <p>They would have indeed the [Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God] to be the Antecedent, that by him, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, were all things created. But Sence, Coherence, Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Conſtruction, and other paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel Texts, can never allow this. Becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſubject of that 15th. Verſe, is Chriſt; who is called the Image, and the Firſt-born; but thoſe words [the Inviſible God] are but an adjunct, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned only to ſhow us whoſe Image he is: But now the Relative muſt reſpect the Subiect, not that, which is but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe words [the firſt-born of

               <p>Sometimes indeed a Relative may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to not the next, but a remoter An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent: But this is only in two caſes: As either for the ſake of ſence, or for the avoiding that interpretation, which may contradict ſome other text: but neither of theſe can be pretended in the caſe before us. For the ſence is as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and natural, as well as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction more eaſie, if the Relative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the <hi>firſt-born,</hi> as if it refer to the <hi>inviſible God;</hi> and the referring it to this firſt-born, doth not contradict any text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but concurs with all them, that aſcribe creation to the Son.

               </p>
               <p>No Text ſaith ſo much in reference to the Father; therefore they may at leaſt as fairly deny the Father to be Creator, as the Son; and doubtleſs the deſign of the Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to obviate and expoſe all Cavils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Doctrine.</p>

               <p>The ſame Letter P. 132. ſaith, That all things were <hi>modelled, not created</hi> by him; and P. 133. explains it thus, Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>modell</hi> and <hi>order</hi> all things upon carth, <hi>becauſe of the great change he introduced.</hi> For which ſence he quotes <hi>Camero, Piſcator, Diodate, Dallee, Vorſtius, Davenant,</hi> and <hi>Grotius.</hi>

For upon theſe words <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. <hi>By him were all things made; Piſcator</hi> ſaith, the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59259:14"/>
Evangeliſt doth here aſſert the Deity of the Son from the effects, or things, that he hath done, <hi>videlicet ex omnium rerum conditarum creatione,</hi> from his creating all things made: where himſelf applies this word <hi>[condita]</hi> to the creation of the World by the Son. Therefore the <hi>Socinian</hi> is falſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in pretending that this Author un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it not of <hi>creation,</hi> but of <hi>model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and <hi>ordering</hi> things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diodat</hi> is ſo far from the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſence, that upon theſe words he aſſerts the Eternal Generation of the Son, and ſpeaks him with the Father an equal, and co-operating cauſe of all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Davenant</hi> upon this Text thus, <hi>Chriſtus non eſt creatura, ſed creaturis omnibus prior; quia per ipſum conditae ſunt:</hi> Chriſt is no creature, but is before all creatures, becauſe they were all made by him. Where this Author by this word <hi>[con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditae]</hi> muſt neceſſarily mean a creation properly, becauſe he gives this asareaſon, why Chriſt is no creature, but is before all creatures, <hi>viz. becauſe he made them all:</hi> But he cannot poſſibly underſtand by it to [model] or [order] becauſe he might model, or order, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding be a creature, and after
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59259:14"/>
thoſe creatures too. Therefore the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> doth here pervert the ſence of this Author, and alſo totally ruines that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, by which he proves that ſence: Which is a crime ſo ſalſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and malicious, that it can admit no Palliation.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Grotius,</hi> he ſhows indeed, that the word here rendred to create, doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſignifie properly to create, but is ſometimes applyed to the new creature. We grant it: But by the leave of ſo great a man, and of this little <hi>Socinian</hi> too; this doth not prove it doth not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie properly to create, in this text. That it is taken improperly in ſome places is no Argument that it ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly in this. Though I ſhall prove in it's place that <hi>Grotius</hi> was neither <hi>Arian</hi> nor <hi>Socinian;</hi> yet I muſt ſay, that he hath not in all places done that juſtice to this Cauſe, which he might and ought to have done it.</p>
               <p>It is worth our while to obſerve, that to prove that Chriſt is a creature, theſe men will have <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This is plain ſhuffling: And indeed where men will take words of a various ſignification in ſuch a ſenſe as is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their own Hypotheſis, but not to the ſcope, and deſign of the place, that uſes 'em, they may perplex any truth, and colour over the fouleſt Hereſy in the World; and in fine, turn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the whole Scriptures into contradictions, and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe.</p>

he muſt exiſt before it: for <hi>non entis nulla ſunt praedicata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſay indeed, this Glory was in decree only, as the Lamb was ſlain from the foundation of the world in decree only: But theſe are not parallel caſes; for then that Lamb could be ſlain no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. But the Scriptures do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly declare that Chriſt did actually exiſt before the world; and therefore might be actually glorified before it. Neceſſity requires that interpretation as to the Lamb; but there is no ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in this caſe; and therefore no ſuch interpretation is to be admitted: for we muſt never leave the common, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and literal ſence of a Scripture; unleſs it be for the ſake of a concurrence with, or non-contradiction of ſome other Scripture, which is not in this caſe; becauſe no Scripture ſaith, he did not exiſt before the world.</p>
               <p>This is a fallacy <hi>à bene conjunctis ad male diviſa:</hi> when Men put ſuch odd conſtructions upon a Text taken by it ſelf, which it abhors, when taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with others. For, in this caſe, was there no Text but this, which aſcribes to him a Being before the World, their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59259:16"/>
gloſs might [perhaps] ſeem to have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle colour of probability in it; and that is the moſt it could then pretend to: But take this Scripture together with thoſe, that declare he did exiſt, when all things began, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. That he was before all things, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 17. That he <hi>made</hi> and <hi>created</hi> all things <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. The caſe is ſo plain from the light, which one text gives to another, that a Man would think that none, but the wilfully blind, could miſtake it.</p>
               <p>If in this manner we follow this, or ſome other point in controverſy between the <hi>Socinian</hi> and our ſelves from one text to another, till we have laid all thoſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which ſpeak to the ſame point; one would think that either the Scripture is ſo worded, that it is extreamly apt to lead all plain honeſt minds into error: or elſe that the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſence is but mere ſhuffles, and evaſions of the truth. One of theſe muſt be; Judge, &amp; chooſe, but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is on the part of God, and <hi>Socinus,</hi> who ſtand here oppoſed each to other.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59259:16"/>
every Creature the Word, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Son, did glorifie his Father, and was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by him. By which this Father doth ſpeak,</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Exiſtence before all Creatures: For every thing did glorifie it's maker ſo ſoon as it did exiſt; but the Son did glorifie his Father before all Creatures, and conſequently did exiſt before them. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Divinity. For had <hi>Irenaeus</hi> numbred the Son with the Creatures, as the firſt of them in the <hi>Arian</hi> ſence; or as the laſt of them in the <hi>Socinian;</hi> he muſt have worded it with ſome reſpect to them, as thus, before all [other] Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: or the <hi>firſt of all Creatures;</hi> the Son did glorifie, &amp;c. but this form di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes him from all Creatures, not as one of them, but as being already di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from, as well as before them all.</p>
               <p>The Son then was before the World, <hi>i.e.</hi> before the Creation, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before all creatures, which was the thing to be proved; whence it follows, that there is no neceſſity of taking thoſe Texts, which aſcribe Creation to him in an improper ſenſe; and if no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they muſt be taken in a proper one;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59259:17"/>
becauſe all Scriptures muſt be taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly; unleſs that ſenſe doth contradict ſome other Scripture; which is not in the caſe before us, becauſe no Text ſaith the Son did not, or that the Father only did create the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since the Son was before the world, he muſt be from Eternity; becauſe the Scriptures no where ſuggeſt a creation between Eternity and Time: But on the contrary, <hi>Moſes</hi> declares that the creation of the World was <hi>the beginning, viz.</hi> of the creature, and conſequently there could be no creature before it. Whence in the Scripture-Phraſe to be in the beginning, that is, before the world; and to be from Eternity, are the ſame thing. For wiſdom doth thus expreſs her Eternal Exiſtence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22, 23. <hi>He poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his ways, before his works of old. I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was:</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25. <hi>when there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no Fountains abounding with water: before the mountains were ſetled, before the Hills was I brought forth.</hi> Thus to be in the beginning, and to be before the world, are Phraſes,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59259:17"/>
which the Spirit uſes to expreſs the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal exiſtence of wiſdom: but the Son was <hi>in the beginning, Joh.</hi> 1. 1. he <hi>was before all things, Coloſ.</hi> 1. 17. and before the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 5. therefore the ſame Phraſes muſt as well expreſs the Eternal exiſtence of the Son too.</p>
               <p>If the Son then was any where called a creature, it muſt be reſtrained to his man-hood, as his deſcent from <hi>Abraham</hi> is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. it was <gap reason="foreign">

this Text, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> have ſo miſerably diſguiſed, not theſe Fathers only, but the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity too, have always pleaded the Divinity of the Son.</p>
               <p>He continues his Argument from 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 32. <hi>Chriſt is God's:</hi> that is (ſaith he) God's Subject; and this he fanſies muſt be God's creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why not God's Son, ſince the Scriptures ſo often call him ſo? but if it muſt be [God's Subject] yet it can do him no Service: For he is his Subject in regard of his Humane Nature, and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Nay, his Subordination to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Son; the Apoſtle (as we ſhall ſhow) calls a <hi>Subjection:</hi> which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be ſo far from affecting his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, that it gives light, and ſtrength, to this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>He cites <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 17, 18. <hi>behold my Servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Argument lyes thus,<hi> p. </hi>5.<hi> If Chriſt were God, it could not without blaſphemy be (abſolutely, and without reſtriction) affirmed of him, that he is the ſervant of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not affirmed of him abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and without reſtriction, but in reference to his Humane Nature, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59259:19"/>
Offices: and till the <hi>Socinian</hi> doth prove that it is abſolutely affirmed of him, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Chriſt is in all reſpects a Servant, and not in ſome only; it hath not ſo much as the face of an Argument.</p>
               <p>His next Scripture is<hi> Phil. </hi>2. 8, 9.<hi> he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf, and became obedient to death, therefore God hath highly exalted him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> His obedience to death, doth indeed prove that he is man, for elſe he could not dye: this we all grant: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this, nor his Exaltation can ever prove he is not God, which is the thing in controverſie. The truth of this will appear from our explication of his next Scripture, which is,</p>
               <p>1<hi> Cor. </hi>15. 28.<hi> Then ſhall the ſon alſo be ſubject to him, who put all things under him. </hi>Which ſubjection he conceits deſtroys his Divinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> [Then] ſhall the Son be ſubject; that is, at the end of the world, <hi>v.</hi> 24. which implies that till then he is in ſome reſpect not ſubject; which is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his Divinity. For all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are in all points his Subjects; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there is any one reſpect, in which the Son is not ſubject, then the Son muſt be God.</p>
               <p>Now his non-ſubjection is this, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59259:20"/>
now he hath a Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> The Church given by the Father, in which he reigns himſelf as Mediator, whence <hi>V.</hi> 25. <hi>He muſt reign.</hi> This Kingdom the Church is ſeparate from the Dominion of the Father, which is the World: Therefore ſo far as he reigns in this Kingdom, ſo far he reigns ſeparate from the Father, and that is <hi>not ſubject</hi> to him. Hence he ſaith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>All Power is given me: Phil</hi> 2. 9. <hi>God hath highly exalted him;</hi> and again <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>I have ſet my King upon my holy Hill of Sion.</hi> But at the end of the World, <hi>He ſhall deliver up this Kingdom to the Father, V.</hi> 24. And then he ſhall reign no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as ſubordinate to the Father, as Son; which the Text expreſſes by [ſubject to the Father]. Whence it muſt be granted, that when he ſaith, the <hi>Father commands and ſends me, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe were ſpoken, and ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, antecedent to this exaltation.</p>
               <p>To cloſe this Argument. On the one hand this exaltation proves no more than this, That the Son hath now a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which he had not before; but it doth not prove that he did not reign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the Father in the Government of the World: And on the other hand,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59259:20"/>
this ſubjection proves that the Son ſhall reſign this Kingdom, but it doth not prove, he ſhall not reign with the Father for ever: Becauſe this ſubjection is not a ſubjection of the creature to God, but a ſubordination of one Perſon to another in the Sacred Trinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum. </hi>3.<hi> P. </hi>6, 7. The true God is not the Miniſter, or Prieſt of any other.<hi> But Chriſt is the miniſter, and Mediator of God, and Men; </hi>Heb. 8. 6.<hi> He hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a more excellent Miniſtry: </hi>ch. 2. 17.<hi> He is a faithful High-Prieſt.—</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe Texts reſpect not his Nature, but his Offices; and therefore do not deny his Divinity. For the ſame Apoſtle applies to him thoſe Scriptures, which can be ſpoke of none but God; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 6, 7. <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever, and ever:</hi> Which <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8. declares that God ſpoke of his Son: And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 25. <hi>Thou haſt laid the foundations of the Earth; and the Heavens are the work of thy hands:</hi> This alſo <hi>V.</hi> 10. applies to the Son.</p>
               <p>Theſe Texts are ſufficiently vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the learned Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, Dr. <hi>Sherlook,</hi> who ſhows that this word [God] <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 6. is not a Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and is not ſpoke of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59259:21"/>
Father, as the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Letter from <hi>Eniedinus,</hi> would have it; who render it [God is thy Throne] <hi>i. e.</hi> The Father is a Throne to the Son: But it is an Attick Vocative, and conſequently can be ſpoke of no other than the Son, whom it ſtiles [God] and to whom it aſcribes an Everlaſting Dominion: As the other Pſalm doth the creation of the World. Thoſe very <hi>Socinians,</hi> who have read this anſwer, do yet ſtill inſiſt upon their own ſence, without taking any notice of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; which is an evident Argument they do not purſue the diſcovery of Truth, but only ſerve their own Hypotheſis.</p>

               <p>Therefore (to put the <hi>Socinian</hi> into a right method of diſpute, which he yet ſeems totally a ſtranger to, there being nothing proper and concluding in all his Arguments) let him prove that in this Text theſe words [One God] are ſpoke excluſive of the Son; and that the Son's Interceſſion with the Father is inconſiſtent with his Divinity: This is to his purpoſe, and moſt be done, or elſe he muſt give up this Text, and indeed his Cauſe together.</p>

His Argument is fallacious; for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that to God in reference to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which we apply to one Perſon in the God-head in reference to another; and lyes thus, God cannot pray to the Creature, therefore the Son cannot pray to the Father: a <hi>Socinian</hi> Argument in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which all men elſe would be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of.</p>

For though God cannot come in the Name, and by the Authority of a Creature, yet the Son may come in the Name, and by the Authority of the Father: becauſe, though the Son is equal to the Father as God, yet the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater than the Son, as Father. For which reaſon <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> whom this Letter beſpatters for an <hi>Arian, Institut. Theol. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 32. ſaith, That the Son refers all things to the Father, as the Fountain of the Deity; of, and from whom the Son is. By this he rejects a Co-ordination, but aſſerts a Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Perſons in the Trinity: and therefore at the ſame time both ruins theſe Objections, and alſo eſtabliſhes the Doctrine of a Trinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59259:24"/>
He proceeds; God declares himſelf to be the prime object of Faith and Worſhip; but the Son doth not ſo, for <hi>John</hi> 12. 44. <hi>He that believes on me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not on me, but on him that ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt doth in this very Text propoſe himſelf as the object of Faith and Worſhip; for he ſaith, <hi>He that believes on me,</hi> which aſſerts that men did believe on him, and implys that they ought to do ſo; what follows is but a qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thing ſuitable to his ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to his Father; for ſuch an one believes <hi>not on me,</hi> that is, ſolely, or ultimately: but <hi>on him that ſent me,</hi> i. e. on him, as well as me; by which he doth not exclude, but include himſelf with the Father, as the object of Faith and Worſhip. This ſenſe muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, elſe you run into theſe two ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. You make the firſt clauſe aſſert, what the ſecond denyes; and the ſecond deny what the firſt aſſerts, <hi>viz.</hi> That men do believe on him, and yet do not believe on him: thev do not believe, and yet they believe ſtill.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59259:24"/>
2. Theſe Scriptures, which make Faith in Chriſt a condition of Salvation, ſuch as <hi>John</hi> 3. 36. <hi>He that believes on the Son, hath Everlaſting Life;</hi> muſt be razed out of our Bibles.</p>
               <p>But perhaps he may trifle upon that word [prime] object, which hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it. For if the Father be the prime object as he is the firſt Perſon in the Trinity; yet the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, are the One, and only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in regard of Nature.</p>
               <p>But as the Texts, he here quotes, cannot ſerve his Hypotheſis, ſo there is One among them, that totally deſtroys it, <hi>viz.</hi> John 8. 42. <hi>I proceeded forth, and came from God:</hi> that is, I am not from the Earth, but from Heaven: this is the Apoſtles ſenſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>That he aſcended, what is it, but that he deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt?</hi> Whence he did not firſt aſcend to receive his Doctrine and Authority from God, as <hi>Socinus</hi> dreams; but he firſt deſcended from God, <hi>with whom he was in the beginning,</hi> John 1. 1. and <hi>with whom he was glorified before the World,</hi> John 17. 5. Our ſenſe falls in with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Scriptures, which on every ſide
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59259:25"/>
confirm and ſupport it: but theirs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with endleſs difficulties in wreſting and perverting them; that is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of truth, but this oſ falſhood.</p>
               <p>Argum. 5.<hi> pa. </hi>9.<hi> God was always moſt wiſe, but Chriſt increaſed in Wiſdom, </hi>Luke 2. 52.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Text ſaith, he increaſed in <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Stature,</hi> which word <hi>[Stature]</hi> ſuits not a Divine Nature, but an Human Body, which ſhews that the Text ſpeaks of him, not ſimply, as if in his whole Capacity, without any exception, he increaſed in Wiſdom, but only as Man, and conſequently this Text proves he is Man; but doth not prove he is not God, which is the deſign of this Argument. This is a demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſtudied corruption of the truth; for (like the Devil) he quotes but one part of the Text, to the end he may pervert the whole.</p>
               <p>He proceeds, <hi>God was never ignorant of any thing;</hi> but he makes it that Chriſt was ignorant of two:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the place where <hi>Lazarus</hi> was buried, <hi>John</hi> 11. 34. <hi>Where have ye laid him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59259:25"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This no more proves that he knew not the place, than Gods asking <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4. 9. <hi>Where is</hi> Abel <hi>thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> doth prove that God knew not what was become of him? How can we preſume he was ignorant of this, who of himſelf knew both his death, and the time of it too. That he would not in every thing give demonſtrations of his Divinity, is no argument againſt it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He pleads that Chriſt knew not the day of Judgment, for <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 32. <hi>Of that day knows no Man</hi> (in the Greek 'tis [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>none knows) no not the Angels—neither the Son, but the Father;</hi> St. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, ch. 24. 36. adds, <hi>but the Father only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He knew it not as Man; but this doth not prove, he is not God, and did not know it as ſuch. For <hi>John</hi> 21. 17. <hi>He knew all things,</hi> and therefore muſt know this, or this muſt be nothing. In 1 <hi>King</hi> 8. 39. <hi>God only knows the Hearts of Men;</hi> but <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 25. Chriſt <hi>knew what is in Man:</hi> But to know the Hearts of Men, and to know what is in Man, are the ſame in Senſe; therefore Chriſt knows what God only knows; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59259:26"/>
Chriſt muſt be God, and for that cauſe Omniſcient. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>I am he who ſearch the Heart.</hi> This <hi>Let.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 154. doth acknowledge that Chriſt ſpoke of himſelf. But this (as we know) is proper to God, who alone can ſearch the Heart: Therefore our Savior's Application of it to himſelf, is a Manifeſt Aſſertion of his own Divinity, and conſequently of his Omniſcience, which is inſeparable from the Divine Nature. Whence it muſt be that he knew it not as Man only, but yet at the ſame time muſt know it as God.</p>
               <p>But here the <hi>Socinian</hi> pleads, that he knew many things not of himſelf; but by Communication from the Father, as the Prophets did, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 12. <hi>I know the Evil thou wilt do to the Children of Iſrael:</hi> Therefore ſome extraordinary Knowledges in Chriſt, do ſpeak his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg no more Omniſcient and Inherent, than that of the Prophets. So to this purpoſe <hi>p.</hi> 155.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are very unlike Caſes. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Prophet knew this Man ſo far as concerned his future Dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this People: But this doth not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59259:26"/>
prove, that he knew this Man any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or any other Man at all. Whereas <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 24. Chriſt <hi>knew all Men,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>He knew what was in Man;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that is in Man: Which never was affirmed of any of the Prophets. From which alone it appears, that his Knowledge was much more extenſive than any of the Prophets.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He knew all things <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 17. which imports an infinite Knowledge; But an infinite Knowledge can never be Communicated to a finite Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Becauſe there is an infinite Diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the faculty and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: Therefore the Knowledge which Chriſt had, ſpeaks him infinite, and that is God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Hypotheſis, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch a Knowledge can be Communicated to a Creature, doth confound the Eſſential properties of God, and the Creature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes the Creature infinite, as well as the Creator, and</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>I am he who ſearch the Heart:</hi> Which Phraſe [ſearch the Heart] was never applyed to any of the Prophets; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59259:27"/>
to Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt: Yet he ſaith, not only <hi>I</hi> do it, but <hi>I am he</hi> that do it; which is more Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and implies, that this is his own Act, and conſequently, that his Knowledge of the Heart, is from his own ſelf. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Knowledge was not like the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; for their's was Finite, but his Infinite: Their's Communicated, his Inherent.</p>
               <p>For which Reaſons, as well as others, Antiquity put that Senſe upon theſe Texts, which might not deny, but eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh not his Omniſcience only, but ſuch as is not Communicated, but Inherent too: For <hi>Greg. Naz. Ora.</hi> 36. <hi>Athanaſ. tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Contr. Ar. Ora.</hi> 4. &amp;c. he knows this day <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as God: And conſequently muſt know it of himſelf, but he knew it not, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as Man; hereby making thoſe words [none knows] to exclude not what is God, and therefore not the Son as God; but all the Creatures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son as Man.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Senſe muſt we take that of St. <hi>Mathew Ch.</hi> 24. 36. <hi>of that Day, and Hour, knows no Man, no, not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Heaven, but my Father only.</hi> For
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59259:27"/>
here [Father] muſt not be taken perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally for the Father, in oppoſition to the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt: But eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, in oppoſition to that word [Man] of that Day and Hour, knows no Man—but the Father only; therefore theſe words [the Father only] exclude the Son from this Knowledge as Man, but not as God. This expoſition is cleared, and confirmed from hence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in the Scriptures [Father] doth often ſignifie God eſſentially, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, Son and Holy Ghoſt, who are of, and from, the Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Senſe muſt be granted, elſe you make this one Text, to contradict all thoſe which ſay the Son knows <hi>all things,</hi> &amp;c. and</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Excluſive Particles [none] knows, or the Father [only] <hi>i. e.</hi> God [only] knows: Muſt be ſo Interpreted in divers places of Scripture, as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>No Man</hi> [in the Greek it is here alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> none] <hi>knows who the Son is but the Father,</hi> or the Father only. Whence they may as well exclude the Holy Ghoſt from the Knowledge of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59259:28"/>
Son, as the Son from knowing the Day of Judgment; becauſe this Particle [none] muſt be as Excluſive in that Text, as in this. But this Word cannot Exclude the Holy Ghoſt from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Son, becauſe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>The Spirit ſearches all things, even the deep things of God:</hi> Which word [ſearch] doth imply, that this Knowledge is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and from himſelf, when applyed to the Spirit, as well as when applyed to the Father in the ſearching the Heart: And conſequently by parity of Reaſon, it cannot Exclude the Son from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that Day.</p>
               <p>Therefore when I find theſe Texts cited by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> confineing theſe Knowledges to God; and yet meet with others, which aſcribe infinite Knowledge to the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, I muſt conclude, not that the Son and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, are either ignorant of ſome things, for then I muſt contradict thoſe Texts, which ſay they know all things, or that they are Creatures indowed with an infinite Knowledge; becauſe this (as is Diſputed already) is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: But I muſt conclude they are
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59259:28"/>
God; and therefore are not Excluded by thoſe Texts, from knowing thoſe things of themſelves; but are included with the Father in the God-Head; and therefore are with the Father, that One God, to whom all things are open, and naked.</p>
               <p>He proceeds, Chriſt aſcribed the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of his Judgment to the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>If I Judge, my Judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſent me:</hi> Which he thinks an Argument againſt his Divinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. I am not alone, but I and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>—that is, the Father hath not left me alone, but bears witneſs to me by Miracles. This ſpeaks not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of his Judgment, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity of this People, and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant means, that he vouchſafed them. Whence he ſo often appeals to his Works <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 25. <hi>The Works that</hi> I <hi>do in my Fathers Name, they teſtifie of me,</hi> and v. 38. <hi>though ye believe not me, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Works.</hi> Therefore this proves the Grace of God the Father, but doth not diſprove the Divinity of the Son.</p>
               <p>He inſiſts, God cannot be tempted,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59259:29"/>
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. but the Son was Tempted of the Devil.</p>

               <p>He cites<hi> Luke </hi>18. 19.<hi> Why calleſt thou me Good? There is none good, ſave One, that is God. </hi>On which the Letter ſaith,<hi> he refuſed to be called Good, becauſe God only is Good.</hi>

This they know is our Doctrine, and therefore ought not only to propoſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59259:30"/>
this Scripture, but alſo to prove an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency between this Scripture, and this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: This he doth not attempt, not will ever be able to perform. But it ſeems it is enough for a <hi>Socinian</hi> to ſtart an Error, and then leave it to the World, in hope ſome may take it, as the Man did the Snake, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Houſes.</p>
               <p>He proceeds, God needs no aid of any other; but Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he that ſent me, is with me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The thing in Controverſie is, whether the Son be God, as well as Man: The <hi>Socinian</hi> brings this Text againſt us; but if we at preſent only ſuppoſe that he is both, which we muſt do, till it be diſproved, he can never tell me, why the Fathers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with the Human Nature of Chriſt ſhould neceſſarily imply a denial of his Divine Nature; and conſequently this Text is no due Medium, whence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his point.</p>
               <p>He adds,<hi> God cannot Pray for himſelf, and People, but Christ Prays for himſelf and Diſciples. </hi>Luk. 22. 42<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heb. 5. 7.<hi> &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We Teach that Chriſt is both God and Man: Now he Prayed for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, only as Man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 42. that this Cup, <hi>viz.</hi> his Paſſion, now at hand, might paſs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59259:30"/>
from him. He Prayed for others, as Prieſt, Heb. 56. <hi>Thou art a Priest for ever,</hi> whence <hi>v.</hi> 7. in <hi>the days of his Fleſh—he offered up Prayers:</hi> Whence the <hi>Socinian</hi> thinks he cannot be God, that is to ſay, his Praying muſt hinder the Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from being united to the Divine; for which he can produce neither Scripture nor Reaſon. Nay, as Man he dyed, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this was United to the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: And if his Death could not hinder this Union, much leſs can his Praying.</p>
               <p>But to ſhew the weakneſs of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we will add, though he cannot Pray conſidered Eſſentially as God; for ſo there is nothing above him, yet he may Pray conſidered perſonally, as the Son of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father; for as Son, he is subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the Father, and conſequently as Son may Pray the Father. This is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then no more to his purpoſe, than if he had told us a Story of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, or <hi>Noah</hi>'s Planting a Vinyard.</p>
               <p>He urges farther, <hi>Chriſt Dyed, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raiſed him from the Dead, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19, 20. Whence alſo he fancies he cannot be God.</p>
               <p>He that dyed, and was raiſed, muſt be Man; but his Argument implies, that he who raiſed him, muſt be God, which is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59259:31"/>
enough to our purpoſe: For he raiſed himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 2. 19. <hi>deſtroy this Temple, and in three days I will raiſe it up;</hi> which <hi>v.</hi> 21. ſaith, he ſpake of the Temple of his Body.

               </p>
               <p>But the<hi> Socinian </hi>pretends, Let. 3. p. 89.<hi> That Chriſt raiſed his Body by a Power communicated to him by the Father; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly his being raiſed is always attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Father, not to himſelf.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is falſe; for that Text doth attribute it to himſelf, <hi>I will raiſe it up.</hi> Therefore either the Son muſt be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or elſe his Reſurrection is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attributed to the Father.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This notion makes the Raiſer, and the raiſed, to be the ſame: which is as incongruous as to ſpeak the Maker, and the thing made to be the ſame.

4. The aſcription of it to the Father doth not deny the co operation of the Son: as the aſcription of it to the Son doth not deny the co-operation of the Father; for then thoſe Texts, of which ſome aſcribe it to the Father, others to the Son, muſt be contradictory. But the aſcription of it to both doth declare the Divinity of both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now both muſt be God, or elſe they could not raiſe the dead.</p>
               <p>His next Scripture, which is <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>All Power is given me;</hi> is already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. For this Power here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him reſpects only the Government of the Church, to which he was now exalted; which the Pſalmiſt expreſſes by ſeting him a King on the Holy Hill of <hi>Sion:</hi> but this doth not prove that he had not, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to this, a Power with the Father in the Government of the World. This proves he had now a new Government, but doth not prove that therefore he was not God: becauſe the Father had a new Government upon the Creation of the World, but yet was God. Such additionals prove an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the things added, but not in thoſe Divine Perſons, to whom they are added. All the difference is, this Power was given the Son. True, but this (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59259:32"/>
ſpeaks the Son ſubordinate to the Father, but doth not deſtroy his Nature, by which he is God.</p>
               <p>Argum. 7. p. 11.<hi> Chriſt in the Scriptures is always ſpoken of as a diſtinct and different Perſon from God: and is deſcribed to be the Son of God, and the Image of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is perſonally diſtinct, and therefore is not God the Father: but he is not eſſentially diſtinct, and therefore muſt be God the Son. If the <hi>Socinian</hi> then would gain his point, he muſt prove not only [a] diſtinction, which we grant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but [ſuch] a diſtinction, which we deny.</p>
               <p>But he hath ſaid that Chriſt is the<hi> Son of God, </hi>and<hi> the Image of God; </hi>whence he concludes,<hi> p. </hi>12. thus,<hi> it is as impoſſible that the Son, or Image of the one true God, ſhould himſelf be that One true God; as that the Son ſhould be the Father, and the Image be the very thing, whoſe Image it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Profoundly argued, and like a a <hi>Socinian!</hi> For he falſly ſuppoſes that the Father only is the One true God: when Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are together the one true God. Therefore take the <hi>One true God,</hi> and the inviſible God, perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Father only; and we grant that the Son of that One true God cannot be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59259:32"/>
that One true God, becauſe the Son cannot be the Father: and that the Image of the inviſible God cannot be the inviſible God, becauſe (as he ſaith) the Image cannot be that very thing, whoſe Image it is.</p>
               <p>But take the <hi>One true God,</hi> and the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God,</hi> eſſentially for Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and then the Son with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Holy Spirit, is that One true God: and the Image of the inviſible God, with the Father and Holy Ghoſt, is that inviſible God; becauſe all three Perſons together are the one true and inviſible God.</p>
               <p>Now the Son is called the <hi>Image of the inviſible God,</hi> becauſe as an Image repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents that very thing, whoſe Image it is, ſo the Son repreſents the Father, as having in himſelf all the perfections of the Father flowing from the ſame Eſſence common to both. Whence he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 14. 8. <hi>He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as <hi>Hilar. Pict.

               </p>
               <p>Our Doctrine then is not <hi>ſimply impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and <hi>contradictory to common ſenſe,</hi> as the Letter pretends: but theirs is palpably
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59259:33"/>
falſe and abſurd; for all theſe Arguments (as he calls them) run upon theſe two falſe ſuppoſitions; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is but one Nature in Chriſt: for he proves that Chriſt is Man, and thence concludes he cannot be God; when the Scriptures abundantly declare that he is both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is but one Perſon in the God-head: for he often proves that Chriſt is not God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, as many of his quotations muſt be underſtood; and thence concludes he is not God; though the Scriptures prove that Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt are God.</p>
               <p>Thus he ſuppoſes what we deny, that there is but one Nature in Chriſt, and but one Perſon in the God-head; but proves only what we grant, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt is Man, and that the Son is not the Father.</p>
               <p>But let him prove firſt that there is but one Nature in Chriſt, and then that Chriſt is Man: and again, firſt that there is but one Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father in the God-head; and then that the Son is not the Father; from each of which it will follow that the Son cannot be God; nothing leſs can conclude his point: but this method of his proves nothing againſt us, but only
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59259:33"/>
betrays the <hi>Socinians</hi> want either of Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty or Judgment.</p>
               <p>However, he concludes his Arguments (as he calls them) with a <hi>Socinian</hi> Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; aſſerting, <hi>p.</hi> 13. that there is in Scripture no real foundation for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Son. For proof of which he now flyes above common Argument, and can ſtoop to nothing below Demonſtration.</p>
               <p>§. Demonſt. 1. par. 8. p. 13.<hi>—So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scriptures expreſly declare, that only the Father is God. </hi>For proof of this he quotes, John 17. 1, 3.<hi> Father—this is Eternal Life, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou hast ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Letter ſaith, that <hi>Only the Father is God,</hi> which denyes the Son, and Holy Ghoſt is God: but this Text ſaith, the <hi>Father is the only true God:</hi> this excludes the Gentile Gods, but not the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, who with the Father are the only true God. He here removes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive particle [only] from the praediciate, the <hi>[true God]</hi> to the ſubject [thee] for (pardon the repetition) the Apoſtle ſaith—<hi>thee the only true God;</hi> but the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſaith, <hi>only thee the true God;</hi> which is ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Text contrary to all antient
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59259:34"/>
and authentick reading, that utterly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the very ſenſe and deſign of it.</p>
               <p>You have then a Demonſtration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, not that <hi>only the Father is God,</hi> but that the Scriptures and <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> are at odds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the one or the other muſt be Reformed.</p>
               <p>The next words [and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent] do Diſtinguiſh the Son from the Father as to Office, ſo doth 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. there is <hi>but one God</hi>—and <hi>One Lord;</hi> but they do not Diſtinguiſh him as to Nature. The ſame is true of other Quotations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Head; and conſequently none of 'em prove what he undertakes, <hi>viz.</hi> that only the Father is God.</p>
               <p>Demonſt. 2. parag. 9. p. 14.<hi> If Chriſt were God as well as Man, it had been alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Superfluous to give the Holy Ghoſt to his ſaid Human Nature as a Director, and a Guide: For what other help could that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture need, which was one Perſon with (as they ſpeak) God the Son, and in which God the Son did perſonally dwell?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Quotations are <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 2 and <hi>Ch.</hi> 10. 38. Which prove only this, that the Holy Ghoſt was given to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature of Chriſt: Which the poor Man thinks a Demonſtrative proof, that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59259:34"/>
Chriſt was not United to the Eternal Word, or Son of God; and Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was not God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Demonſtration (as he calls it) is founded not upon Scripture, but upon a <hi>Socinian</hi> Preſumption. For no Scripture ſaith, that if the Son was God, he ſhould not have had the Preſence and Conduct of the Spirit of God. And certainly it is a Monſtrous way of Arguing, that this or that is neceſſary for God to have done, or not to have done, and then to conclude, he hath, or hath not done it: For this is no better, than to limit the Almighty, to give Rules to Infinite Wiſdom, and to make not the Scripture, but our own blind Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, the Rule of our Faith. In this way the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> Demonſtrate an Univerſal Head of the Church: Some the Divine Right of this, or that Form of Church-Government; and after the ſame Methods, others may as well Demonſtrate away all Religion, and introduce what they pleaſe of their own.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Foundation is utterly falſe. For the Church is the Body of Chriſt, which <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 15, 16. is ſaid to be <hi>fitly joyned to him</hi> our Head, to intimate that he doth actuate, and guide it; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59259:35"/>
ſtanding this, the Spirit is ſent to lead her into all Truth. Where let the <hi>Socinian</hi> tell me, why both the Son of God, and the Holy Spirit, may not guide the Human Nature, as well as Myſlical Body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It follows, that the ſame works of God are aſcribed now to one Perſon, then to another: Thus we find it in this of Conduct, in that of Creation, &amp;c. but this doth not deſtroy, but rather declare and confirm the Doctrine of a Trinity: Becauſe it proclaims thoſe Powers and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which the <hi>Socinian</hi> would Limit to one Perſon, to be common to all three; whence it follows, that all three muſt be God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demonſt.</hi> 3. <hi>parag.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 15. We have an Inſtance of this in the Demonſtration now before us. For he would not have the Son to be God, becauſe he Aſcribes his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to the Holy Spirit, Mat. 12. 28. <hi>I caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God.</hi> Now this doth not prove the Son is not God, any more than the Aſcribing Creation to the Son, doth prove that the Father did not Create. But it is a good ſtep toward the proving that the Holy Ghoſt is God; For Miracles can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wrought but by a Divine Power,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59259:35"/>
therefore if the Holy Ghoſt hath ſuch a Power of Miracles, that they are wrought by him, if he be a Perſon which we ſhall eaſily prove, he muſt be a Divine Perſon, and that is God.</p>
               <p>Demonſt. 4. parag. 11. p. 15.<hi> Had our Lord been more than a Man, the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament—would not Deſcribe him barely as the Seed of the Woman.—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They Deſcribe him as ſuch, but not barely as ſuch; for they Deſcribe him alſo as God. Thus Iſa. 40. 3. <hi>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make ſtrait in the Deſert an High way for our God.</hi> This is evidently ſpoke of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> with one conſent, apply it to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Mark</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3, 4. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 23. Where they all agree, that the Voice in the Wilderneſs, was the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> and that the way he was to prepare, was the way of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> therefore according to their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Scripture, the Prophet doth Stile the Son, the Lord our God.</p>
               <p>Obſerve farther, that this Text calls the <hi>Meſſias Lord,</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> it is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which (we ſhall prove) is an Incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Name of God, which therefore Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts the Divinity of him, to whom it is applyed: And conſequently the Prophet in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59259:36"/>
this place declares him to be God in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Senſe.</p>
               <p>Compare <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 6, 7. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 25. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 10. and you will find, that according to the Apoſtle's Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thoſe Texts, the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> Aſcribes to the Son, an Everlaſting Throne, and the Creation of the World; and certainly this Deſcribes him not as the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but as God.</p>
               <p>§. 4. This Pen having thus attack'd the Divinity of the Son, now turns it ſelf againſt that of the Holy Ghoſt; affirming <hi>p.</hi> 16. that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt—is only the Power and Inſpiration of God, at leaſt is not himſelf God, which they bold is aſcertain'd by theſe Conſiderations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſid. 1.<hi> The Holy Ghoſt or Spirit, and the Power of God, are ſpoken of as one and the ſame thing, </hi>1<hi> Cor. </hi>2. 4, 5.<hi> Luke </hi>1. 35. Ch. 11. 2c. Mat. 12. 28. Luk. 24. 49.<hi> Compared with </hi>Act. 1. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is here to prove, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt is only the Power and Inſpiration of God, but is not himſelf God, but theſe Texts ſay no ſuch thing, and conſequently do not aſcertain this Poſition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Bleſſed Spirit is not properly the Inſpiration of God, but ſomething diſtinct
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59259:36"/>
from it. For 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Wiſdom, Faith,</hi> &amp;c. are given by the Spirit: Whence <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4. they are called the <hi>Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence each Text Diſtinguiſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Spirit, and theſe Gifts: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them are the Inſpiration of God. For Inſpiration is the Act, whereby the Holy Ghoſt Conveighs theſe Gifts to Men, which <hi>v.</hi> 11. is called <hi>a dividing</hi> them.</p>
               <p>This is clear from 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> inſpired, or <hi>given by the Inſpiration of God.</hi> Here Scripture is the gift or thing inſpired, God is the giver or inſpirer; therefore Inſpiration can be but the Act, whereby it is given or Inſpired. Therefore as the Graces before mentioned, viz. <hi>Wiſdom, Faith,</hi> &amp;c. are the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo the Holy Ghoſt, muſt give them by way of Inſpiration. The <hi>Socinian</hi> then doth here confound the Agent and the Act, making the Giver and the Giving, the ſame thing; which is as falſe and abſurd, as to ſay my Act of Donation is my Perſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He Aſſerts, that the Holy Ghoſt is only the <hi>Power of God,</hi> that is, as he often explains himſelf, is neither God, nor a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But this is neither proved, nor ever can be; becauſe ſuch Power can know no more of God, than a Grace or Vertue can
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59259:37"/>
do, which are qualities, not perſons: But 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. The <hi>Spirit ſearches all things, even the deep things of God:</hi> Whence the Spirit muſt be not a ſimple Power, but a Perſon endowed with an Infinite knowledge, and that can be no other than God.</p>
               <p>What the Letter oppoſes, the Scriptures are clear in; for <hi>Act.</hi> 5. Ananias <hi>did lye to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> whence <hi>v.</hi> 4. ſaith, he <hi>lyed not to Man, but to God.</hi> Therefore the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt muſt be God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eniedinus,</hi> who is much more Manly in his performances, than this <hi>Epiſtler</hi> Parallels this of <hi>Ananias,</hi> lying to the Holy Ghoſt, and to God, with the <hi>Jews</hi> Rejecting <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> and God: Thus, the <hi>Jews</hi> Rejected <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> immediately, who was ſet over them; but they Rejected God mediately, who did ſet <hi>Samuel</hi> over them: So <hi>Ananias</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Holy Ghoſt immediately, who was given to the Apoſtles: But he lyed to God mediately, who gave the Holy Ghoſt to the Apoſtles; whence as the <hi>Jews</hi> did Sin differently againſt <hi>Samuel</hi> and God, <hi>viz.</hi> immediately, and mediately, ſo did <hi>Ananias</hi> againſt the Holy Ghoſt and God, whence he would have the Holy Ghoſt and God, as much diſtinct, as <hi>Samuel</hi> and God; and that is eſſentially.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:59259:37"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That place as put by the Objector, is not parallel with this: For that ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they Rejected not <hi>Samuel,</hi> but God; but this doth not ſay, that <hi>Ananias</hi> lyed not to the Holy Ghoſt, but to God. Therefore this Text doth not diſtinguiſh between the Holy Ghoſt, and God, as that doth between <hi>Samuel</hi> and God: And conſequently the Holy Ghoſt and God, are not here made ſo diſtinct, as <hi>Samuel</hi> and God.</p>
               <p>But take theſe Texts right, and we may allow a Parallel. But then it muſt lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> and again between God and the Holy Ghoſt; thus the <hi>Jews</hi> thought they Rejected <hi>Samuel</hi> only, as <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> thought he lyed to <hi>Peter</hi> only; but ſaith God to <hi>Samuel,</hi> they Reject <hi>not thee, but me:</hi> And ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias,</hi> thou <hi>haſt lyed to the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> that is, <hi>not to Men, but to God.</hi> Therefore while that Text diſtinguiſhes between <hi>Samuel</hi> and God, as different, this Unites the Holy Ghoſt, and God as the ſame.</p>
               <p>Conſid. 2. p. 17.<hi> A Manifeſt Diſtinction is made, as between God and Christ, ſo alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Holy Ghoſt: So that 'tis impoſſible the Spirit ſhould be God himſelf. </hi>His Quotations are, Rom. 5. 5.<hi>—the Love

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He knows we grant there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Diſtinction, that as the Son, ſo the Holy Ghoſt is not God the Father. This is all theſe Texts do prove, without which there could not be a Trinity. But none of 'em prove that the Son and Holy Ghoſt are not God, which is the deſign of this Conſideration.</p>
               <p>But becauſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 27. here quoted, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes Perſonal Acts to the Holy Ghoſt—<hi>he makes Interceſſion:</hi> Therefore, that he may at once deſtroy his Divinity, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality both, he pleads, that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt is ſpoke of as a Perſon by the ſame Figure, that Charity is deſcribed as a Perſon,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 4, 5. The Argument lyes thus, Perſonal Acts cannot prove the Holy Ghoſt to be a Perſon, becauſe they cannot prove that Charity is a Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This doth as effectually deſtroy the Perſonality of the Father and the Son, as of the Holy Ghoſt: For (according to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59259:38"/>
this Argument) Perſonal Acts do not prove the Father or the Son to be Perſons; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not prove, that Charity is a Perſon; but that Argument which proves too much, proves nothing at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scriptures do Aſcribe to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, not only thoſe Perſonal Acts which they do not to Charity, or to any thing elſe, which is not a Perſon: But a Subſiſtence to the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, together in the ſame Text 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. there <hi>are</hi> three—<hi>the Father, the Word,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> implying, that the Subſiſtence of the Holy Ghoſt is as Real and Perſonal, as that of the Father, and the Son.

Cabaliſtical Senſe. Now this neceſſity doth lye in the Caſe of Charity, as much as in that of the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> mentioned, <hi>Let.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 159. For all Men do as well know, that Charity can be no Perſon, as that God can have no Human Parts, as Eyes, Ears, Hands, &amp;c. but this is ſo far from lying in the Caſe of the Holy Ghoſt, that <hi>Let.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 99. doth conſeſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>that all the</hi> Arrians, <hi>and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Socinians <hi>do acknowledge, that the Holy Ghoſt is a Perſon.</hi> Whence this is a conceit ſo weak, as well as Novel, that even the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> themſelves (as he idlely calls them) are divided upon it. It is plain then, that in the Judgment of their own Party, as well as of the Church in all Ages, here is no neceſſity of a Figurative Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and conſequently no ſuch ought to be admitted. The <hi>Socinian</hi> Arguments (we ſee) are like Ghoſts, that appear only to whom they pleaſe, ſince none but a few of their own Party have yet diſcerned 'em.</p>
               <p>Conſid. 3. p. 18. <hi>The Spirit is obtained for us of God by our Prayers,</hi> Act. 15. 8. Luk. 11. 13. Whence he thinks the Spirit is not God, becauſe he is given by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59259:39"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the Spirit he here underſtands the Gifts of the Spirit; as himſelf explains it: whence he proceeds thus: <hi>but they, viz.</hi> the <hi>Socinians,</hi> ſay alſo, <hi>That if the Holy Spirit were at all a Perſon, much more God, his Gifts—would be beſtowed by himſelf.</hi> which,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Convinces him of contradiction: for he ſaith, they are the gifts of the Spirit, yet denyes that they are given by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: which is as much as to ſay, they are given by the Spirit, and yet are not given by the Spirit, which is a contradiction in terms. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. This utterly deſtroys his Argument, which is this, that the Spirit doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his own gifts, therefore the Spirit is not God, but the Spirit muſt beſtow his own gifts, elſe they could not be his own gifts, but muſt be the gifts of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows 'em; therefore the antecedent being falſe, the conſequent muſt be falſe too.</p>
               <p>Now that the Spirit doth beſtow theſe things, which he acknowledges to be the gifts and graces of the Spirit, is expreſly aſſerted by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9, 10, 11. where he ſaith of theſe very gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit, that the Spirit <hi>divides</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:59259:40"/>
                  <hi>them to every one as he will;</hi> and if he devides 'em to Men, he muſt give 'em to Men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are Synonymous Terms, which are both expreſſive of the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>The Texts he quotes, do prove theſe things are given by the Father, we grant it: but this, and other Texts do prove they are given alſo by the Spirit; but thoſe Texts can no more exclude the Spirit, than theſe can exclude the Father. Therefore they muſt be given by both, as indeed they are by the whole Trinity; for which reaſon they are aſcribed now to one Perſon, then to another; as <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. which are the gifts of the Spirit, are attributed not to the Spirit only, but ſometimes to the Father, as himſelf proves, and ſometimes to the Son, as the Apoſtle declares, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. <hi>him, viz.</hi> the Son <hi>hath God exalted—to be a Prince, and a Saviour, to give Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> (which implyes Faith) <hi>to Iſrael;</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 2. ſpeaking of the gift of Tongues, ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 32, 33. that Jeſus, who was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the dead, <hi>being by the right hand of God exalted,</hi> [he] <hi>viz.</hi> the ſame Jeſus <hi>hath ſhed forth this,</hi> which <hi>ye do ſee and hear.</hi> The reſult is,</p>

1. That the <hi>Socinian</hi> is partial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, in quoting one Text of Scripture in oppoſition to another; And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. He hath not only loſt his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, but hath alſo furniſhed us with one againſt himſelf; for he argues thus, the Spirit doth not give theſe gifts to men; therefore the Spirit is not God; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes that if the Spirit doth give theſe gifts, then the Spirit is God; but (we ſee) he doth give theſe gifts, and therefore muſt be God. And indeed he can be no other than God, who divides theſe manifold gifts of God according to his own Will.</p>
               <p>He proceeds,<hi> there is no Precept, nor Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in all Holy Scripture of Prayer made to the Spirit on this, or any other occaſion: which (on the </hi>Trinitarian<hi> ſuppoſition) that the Holy Spirit is a Perſon, and God; no leſs than the Father, is very ſurprizing, nay utterly unaccountable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. </hi>We deny it, for 2<hi> Cor. </hi>13. 16. we read thus;<hi> The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Love of God, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you all; </hi>which Text we ſhall firſt explain, and then apply it to the preſent Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:59259:41"/>
That word [God] <hi>the love of God,</hi> muſt not be taken eſſentially for God, as if the Son, and Holy Ghoſt were not God: but perſonally for God the Father, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can diſtinguiſh them only from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. My reaſons are theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Other Scriptures (as we have ſaid) do not only ſtile the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt God, but do alſo aſcribe to them infinite Perfections, which are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible to any Creature; and likewiſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to them the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is proper to God, as we ſhall prove anon. Therefore if you make that word [God] in this Text to ſignifie God eſſentially, and conſequently to exclude the Son, and Holy Ghoſt from the Deity; then this Text muſt contradict all them: but that cannot be the true ſenſe of one Text, which contradicts another. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf doth thus explain it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 23.—<hi>Faith from God the Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> where he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes the Son not ſimply from God, but from God the Father; this denyes that the Son is the Father, but ſtill implyes that the Son is God. Now this Text being the more full and perfect, explains that in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:59259:41"/>
by teaching us to ſupply theſe words [the Father] <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the love of God,</hi> viz. <hi>the Father, and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>—Now this Text thus ſupplyed and perfected by that, doth make a diſtinction of Perſons, but not of Eſſences, that is, it teaches that the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, are not the Father, but yet one God. This ſenſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſed to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and therefore muſt intend it to theſe <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Text, thus explained, is not only a benediction to this Church, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Prayer to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, that this Grace may deſcend upon it.</p>
               <p>We never pray to God, but we pray to Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, which was the judgment of Antiquity: For <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who floriſhed in the middle of the Age next after the Apoſtles, ſaith in his Apologie, we Chriſtians worſhip Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and yet againſt gentile Polytheiſm in the ſame Apology declares, that they worſhiped <hi>God only;</hi> therefore they muſt neceſſarily underſtand it, that all three Perſons together are that one God, whom they worſhiped, and to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59259:42"/>
whom they prayed, which is one part of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, what is the reaſon then, we are not commanded to pray expreſly and particularly to the Holy Ghoſt, as we are to God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In divers Scriptures [God] is put eſſentially for Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; therefore in thoſe Scriptures all Commands, and Examples of praying to God, are to be underſtood incluſively of all three Perſons, who are eſſentially one, and the same God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Father is the firſt Perſon in the Trinity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of and from whom the Son and the Holy Ghoſt are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore as for this reaſon the Son refers things principally to the Father, but not excluſive of himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo for the ſame reaſons Prayers are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed principally to the Father, but yet are to be underſtood incluſive of the Son, and Holy Ghoſt, but not excluſive of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Father is principal Agent in the Government of the World; and the firſt mover in all Divine Operations, ſaying to the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>let us make Man:</hi> whence the Son ſaith, John 5. 17. <hi>my Father works hitherto, and I works</hi> by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59259:42"/>
which he ſpeaks the Father principle Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, but himſelf a Co-operator with him.</p>
               <p>Again, the Son from the Father hath the Government of the Church, whence it is called the Kingdom of Chriſt, to which the Father Exalted him, and from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, the Holy Ghoſt is in the Miniſtration of it. Upon which Accounts, Prayers are directed primarily, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Father, but yet are intended as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive to the Son and Holy Ghoſt. They are directed moſt particularly to him from his Priority of Order and Operation; but yet they belong to all three in regard of the ſameneſs of their Nature.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are ſuited to the Rules and Methods of the Divine Oeconomy, and may ſeem difficulties; but had our Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer conſidered well, he had never made them ſupports of an Hereſie.</p>
               <p>Conſid. 4. p. 19.<hi> If the Holy Spirit, and our Lord Christ are—God, no leſs than the Father, then God is a Trinity of Perſons, or three Perſons; but this is contrary to the whole Scripture, which ſpeaks of God as but one Perſon; and ſpeaks of him, and to him by ſingular Pronouns, ſuch as I, Thou, We, Him, </hi>&amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:59259:43"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny that any one Text of Scripture, doth prove that God is but One Perſon. He quotes, Job. 13. 7, 8. <hi>Will ye ſpeak wickedly for God?—Will ye accept his Perſon?</hi>—Whence he thinks, there can be but one Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father in the God-head. To which we Anſwer thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The letter of theſe Texts doth not ſay, that God is but One Perſon: Or that there is but one Perſon in the Godhead, which is the thing to be proved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Reaſon and Deſign of 'em, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly import any ſuch thing. For theſe expreſſions are uſed to ſignifie only the doing unjuſtly for God, as Men do for others, when ſaid to accept their Perſons. For <hi>Job</hi> hereby accuſes his Friends of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and Partiality, in that they juſtified God's Viſitations upon, by Condemning him of Hypocriſie. Therefore theſe Texts are not ſuited to the Nature of God, nor deſigned to Determine, whether there be only one, or more Perſons in the God head, but to ſignifie unjuſt Cenſures; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt import not a Singularity or Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Perſons, but only Partiality in their Judgment, between God and himſelf.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59259:43"/>
                  <hi>Will ye ſpeak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? Will ye accept his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Phraſes that are taken from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ufuages of Men, or as common forms of Speech, are not to be uſed in an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which the Holy Pen-man did not intend them to the Contradiction of thoſe Texts, which profeſſedly ſpeak of that point, this all Men of Reaſon and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt grant me; becauſe in expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture, we are to conſider not only Words, but Phraſes, together with the Scope and deſign of the place, and if ſo, it muſt be granted in this Caſe before us, that theſe Texts in <hi>Jobe,</hi> which concern not the Nature of God, ought not to be brought to prove, there is but one perſon in the God-head, when ſo many Texts on ſet purpoſe, declare the Divine Nature of three.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God here muſt ſignifie the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he ſpeaks to us by his Son, whence the Son is the Image of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Perſon. But however this doth not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59259:44"/>
reach his Caſe; for it proves indeed, that God the Father is but one Perſon, which we all grant: But it doth not prove there is no other Perſon in the God-head, which is the thing in controverſie. Nay,</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Text is not only, not for, but is really againſt, him. For if the Son be the expreſs Image of his Father, he muſt duly Repreſent the Father, as Images duly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent thoſe things, whoſe Images they are: And if he, the Living Image of his Father, duly Repreſents the Father, he muſt have in himſelf all the Perfections of his Father, and conſequently muſt be infinite himſelf, elſe he could not in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Nature, Repreſent infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that he doth ſo, is evident, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his being Termed the Image of his Father, but alſo from thoſe words of his once quoted already, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 8. he <hi>that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father.</hi> So far is this Text from proving, but one Perſon in the God-head, that it conſequentially introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a ſecond.</p>
               <p>He cites, Deut. 6. 4, 5.<hi>—the Lord our God is One: </hi>the word is<hi> Jehovah, </hi>whence the Letter ſaith,<hi> Jehovah is one, </hi>and<hi> that the </hi>Jews<hi> Morning and Evening Repeated

this Verſe, to keep it in perpetual Memory, that </hi>Jehovah<hi> or God, is one only, not two or three.</hi>

As we find no ſuch thing, ſo neither can any ſuch thing ever be; for God hath ſaid, <hi>My Glory will I not give to another:</hi> but this gives a Creature his Name, his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and his Honor; and theſe are his Glory.

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. <hi>The Law was given by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Angels,</hi> Act. 7. 53. <hi>and was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Angels,</hi> Heb. 2. 3. whence he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes that Jehovah, who gave the Law, was not the Son of God, but a created Angel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This doth not follow: for as it was given by Angels, ſo it was <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. in the <hi>hand of a Mediator,</hi> that is, of Chriſt; as <hi>Theophylact</hi> and others take it. But ſome ſay this Mediator was <hi>Moſes:</hi> be it ſo, it is all one. For if <hi>Moſes</hi> was Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, it was only as a Type of Chriſt, and there muſt be an exact Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Type and the Anti-type; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Law was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Mediator, it muſt be given by Chriſt the true and proper Mediator. Whence the Reſult muſt be, that <hi>Moſes</hi> gave it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59259:48"/>
to the People, but Chriſt gave it mediately by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which are miniſtring Spirits. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>c.</hi> 1. 17. the Law was given <hi>by Moſes, but Grace and Truth,</hi> i. e. the Goſpel, <hi>came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he reſpects the immediate Delivery of both; the Law was given immediately by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and the Goſpel immediately by Chriſt: which excludes Chriſt from only an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, but not from a mediate Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Law.</p>
               <p>But the Difficulty is from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2, 3. <hi>If the Word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a juſt recompence of Reward; how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which at firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord?</hi> Upon which <hi>Crellius</hi> ſaith, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is the great Salvation, is pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferred before the Law, becauſe the Law was given by Angels, but the Gopel by the Lord: and conſequently Jehovah, who gave the Law, was not the Lord, but an Angel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59259:49"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Text, which ſaith the Law was <hi>ſpoken by Angels,</hi> doth no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Son, than <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 17. which ſaith the <hi>Law was given by Moſes,</hi> doth exclude thoſe Angels: for indeed it was given by all three. Therefore the Oppoſition lies not between Jehovah and the Son, who are the ſame, and gave both Law and Goſpel too, but</p>
               <p n="1">1. Between his different manner of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving each: for (as before) he gave the Law mediately by Angels; but he gave the Goſpel immediately by himſelf, as the Eternal Word now made Fleſh: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which account Sin againſt the Goſpel is a greater Affront to his Perſon and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, than Sin againſt the Law. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. Between the Nature of each conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in themſelves: this is a great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in compariſon of that. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Sin doth always ariſe proportionate to the means it is committed againſt, therefore upon this Account alſo Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel is greater than Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law.</p>
               <p>Whence this toping Argument of <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> which (he ſaith) doth <hi>penitus ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59259:49"/>
totally overthrow us, doth neither exclude Jehovah the Son from giving the Law, nor yet debaſe him to a created Spirit; and conſequently doth not at all affect us.</p>
               <p>In fine, we grant that <hi>Jehovah</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called an Angel, as he is ſent from the Father; but we deny that an Angel, which is any way declared to be a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirit, is ever called <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Let the Socinian prove this, and then we will diſmiſs this Argument: elſe he faith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Bleſſed Spirit is alſo called <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah:</hi> for <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 7. they tempted the Lord, the Word is [Jehovah]. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. whence the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9. thus, the <hi>Holy Ghost ſaith—When your Fathers tempted [me].</hi> Therefore (according to the Apoſtles Application of theſe Seriptures) the Holy Ghoſt is this <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reſult is, Jehovah is indeed but one God, but yet is three Perſons; <hi>viz.</hi> Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, who are in the Godhead, and therefore are this one God, which was the thing to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59259:50"/>
Whence his next Scripture, which is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 5. <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> the Word is [Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah] <hi>there is no God before me,</hi> is eaſily anſwered. For here Jehovah excludes a Plurality of Gods, but not a Plurality of Perſons in the Godhead.</p>
               <p>He adds (in his great Wiſdom and Judgment) <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Where becauſe [the Lord thy God] is ſingular, and that Word [only] excludes all others, he thinks he hath found a proof that the Father only is God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This proves indeed that there is but one God, which we all grant; but it doth not prove there is but one Perſon in the Godhead; or that the Son and the Holy Ghoſt are not God; which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes.</p>
               <p>But becauſe Suppoſitions grant nothing, we will ſuppoſe that this Text proves that the Father only is God; but then it muſt be granted upon this Suppoſition, that it doth alſo prove, that the Father only is to be worſhipped; for <hi>him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> But the Socinians deny that the Son is God, and yet worſhip him as well
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59259:50"/>
as the Father. Whence it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that either their Religion muſt be an Hereſie, or themſelves Idolaters; for if the Son be God, they are Hereticks in denying it: if he is not, they are Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in worſhipping him. And certainly theſe Men are put to an hard ſhift for Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Proofs, when all the Texts they cite, do either not affect us, or wound themſelves.</p>
               <p>He now proceeds to his ſingular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouns, thus;<hi> No Inſtance can be given in any Language of three Perſons; who ever ſpoke of themſelves, or were ſpoken to, by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Pronouns, as I, Thou, &amp;c. Such ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is contrary to Cuſtom, Grammar, and Senſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this, that of the Learned Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> is the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, viz. <hi>There is no other Example in Nature of three Perſons, who are eſſentially one.</hi> Whence this is an Impropriety in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Creatures, which is none in reference to God. For he may ſpeak of himſelf, or be ſpoken to, ſingularly, becauſe he is but one God; and plurally, becauſe he is three Perſons, without any ungrammatical Soleciſm. And ſometimes
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59259:51"/>
he doth ſpeak plurally, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>Let us make Man:</hi> whence we conclude a Plurality in the Godhead. But this cannot be a Plurality of Eſſences, or Natures, for then there would be a Plurality of Gods, which is contrary to Scripture, for this declares there is but one; but a Plurality of Subſiſtences, which we call Perſons, united in the ſame Nature. This Plurality other Scriptures, particularly <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 6. do determine to three, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and this we call a Trinity, as the Church ever did from the Apoſtles time.</p>
               <p>But to this he ſaith, <hi>God doth here ſpeak of himſelf after the manner of Princes,</hi> p. 21. and therefore is but one Perſon, though he ſaith [Us].</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. He could not ſpeak this after the manner of Princes, for then there was no Prince, nor any Man in the World: nor can he prove any ſuch Cuſtom in the Moſaic Age. Therefore this is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the firſt Writings in the World after the Cuſtom of later Ages, which we cannot allow.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:59259:51"/>
2. In time Princes ſpoke [of] but not [to] themſelves plurally, which yet God doth do, if this Gloſs be true. Therefore this Expoſition, which he pretends is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of Princes, is indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Example.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God himſelf expounds this Text our way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 6. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Hoſt of them by the breath of his Mouth;</hi> that is by the <hi>Lord, viz.</hi> the Father; by the <hi>Word</hi> or Son, and by the Spirit. Now St. <hi>John c.</hi> 1. 1, 3. teaches that by the <hi>Word,</hi> viz. that Word which was <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>Word,</hi> which <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>was made Fleſh,</hi> were all things made. Which directs us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that [Word] in this Pſalm, not of the Command, but of the Eternal, or Subſtantial Word, or Son of God: to whom together with that Spirit, who <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. moved upon the Waters, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring that indigeſted Matter for its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral forms, the Father ſaid, <hi>Let us make Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Senſe of all Antiquity. <hi>Juſt. Mart. Dial. Iren. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 37. he ſpoke to the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>per quos,</hi>

               <p>He proceeds to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. Some, who think of [us]—which he ſaith S. <hi>Paul ſpoke of himſelf only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not probable that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke of himſelf after the manner of Princes, when it is evident he leſſened himſelf in almoſt every thing but Sin and Sufferings.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

                  </gap> have reaſon to believe he ſpoke of himſelf and them together.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke plurally of himſelf, as Princes have done for many Ages, yet what Argument is there in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe to prove that the Father is to be underſtood thus in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1, eſpecially when the Scriptures ſo frequently aſcribe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59259:52"/>
the Creation to the Son, and Holy Ghoſt, as well as to the Father? There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing manly, or cogent in this Quotation. By this time (I think) his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Pronouns have done him as little ſervice as his Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Conſid. 5. and 22.<hi> Had the Son or Holy Ghost been God, this would not have been omitted in the Apoſtles Creed, which </hi>(they ſay) p. 23.<hi> was purpoſely drawn up to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent all the neceſſary Articles of Religion: </hi>but that the Divinity of each is omitted there he would ſain perſwade the World.</p>
               <p>This very Argument had almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted two of my Acquaintance; the one a very ingenious Merchant in this City. I ſhall therefore (according to their deſire) give the fuller Anſwer to it: and ſhall prove</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Creed under the Apoſtles name was never compoſed by the Apoſtles; and</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though it doth not expreſly aſſert the Divinity of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt, yet it ſufficiently teaches both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Creed was never compoſed by the Apoſtles. Some with more Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption than Judgment think <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59259:53"/>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt us. But if you conſult thoſe famous Places, <hi>Iren. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2 &amp; 19. <hi>Tertul. de Virg. Veland. c.</hi> 1. <hi>de Praeſ. Haer. c.</hi> 2. and <hi>adv. Prax. c.</hi> 2. you will find theſe Fathers differ ſo much from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and each from himſelf, both as to the Order and Points of Faith they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; that they evidently ſeem to intend not any ſetled Form, but the Subſtance of Faith contain'd in the Scriptures, whence themſelves might draw the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles they deliver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith indeed, that his <hi>Rule of Truth,</hi> i. e. the Articles there writ, came from the Apoſtles; which ſome have thought ſufficient to prove it of Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Compoſure. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its coming from the Apoſtles is no Argument for them; for that might be from their Writings in the N. Teſt. as well as from this Creed, had they compoſed it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His calling it the <hi>Rule of Truth</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; for it was not cuſtomary, ſo neither is it ſo proper to call a Creed the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> as the Scriptures from whence all Creeds are taken, and by which they muſt be proved. And</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:59259:53"/>
3. There is not ſo much agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Articles in <hi>Iren.</hi> and this Creed called the Apoſtles, as between thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and ſome of thoſe Creeds, which are well known to be the different Creeds of different Churches. Therefore there is nothing in this Father, that can prove the Socinian Aſſertion; but ſomething, that may incline to the contrary.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Tertullian</hi> the Caſe is more clear; for he ſaith <hi>de Praeſ. Haer. c.</hi> 13. that his <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> meaning the Articles there mentioned, were taught by Chriſt: but Chriſt compoſed no Symbol: and <hi>adv. Prax. c.</hi> 2. his Rule taught the Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt: but this Creed teaches no ſuch thing. Therefore from both he muſt intend the Scriptures, not a Creed; or if any, yet however not this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arius in Epiphanius adv. Haer. l.</hi> 2. <hi>to</hi> 2. <hi>Haer.</hi> 69. would fain have juſtified his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie againſt the Divinity of the Son from the Creed of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> which differs to much from this under the Apoſtles name, that none can pretend they are the ſame. But it muſt be granted, he would much rather have appealed to this, had it then
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59259:54"/>
been, or believed to be theirs, and alſo thought not to teach the Divinity of the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe a Creed compoſed by the Apoſtles themſelves would have been of much more force and Authority than one compoſed by any particular Church whatever. Therefore his Appeal to that, but not to this, is to me a Demonſtration that this Creed was then not known, or elſe not believed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be theirs, or to import any ſuch Doctrine.</p>

To conclude this Argument; Had the Apoſtles compoſed this Creed, it would have been found firſt in the Hebrew or Greek Tongues, in which they wrote: it would have been part of the Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or at leaſt have been mentioned in the Hiſtory of the Acts, and have been known to all the Churches founded by the Apoſtles, it being pretended to be wrote before their Diſperſion from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> But on the contrary we find it not till the fourth Century, and then known only to the Latin Church, which did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude it on the World under the Name of the Apoſtles; witneſs <hi>Preuotius, Feu arden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Baronius,</hi> the <hi>Paris</hi> Doctors in their Cenſures of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and others, who take up the Cudgels from their old Pope <hi>Leo</hi> in the fifth Age, as he did from <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus</hi> from the ſpurious <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> in his Epiſtle to S. <hi>James;</hi> which was ever rejected by all conſidering Men, becauſe it appeared not in the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ages; and alſo mentions the death of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who out lived this <hi>James,</hi> to whom it is directed.</p>

From <hi>Rome</hi> the Reformed Churches received this Doctrine, and that Rubrick of ours which calls it the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> is taken out of the Roman Breviary; which our Reformers (not fore-ſeeing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages the Socinians make of it) thought of no ſuch moment as to call for an Alteration.

               <p>Had it not been for theſe Socinian Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudences diſcovered in this Letter, and in the fifth to the Publiſher, as well as in other of their Writings both at home and abroad; I had reſted in that of <hi>Calvin</hi> Inſtit. l. 2. c. 16.

               <p n="2">2. The Socinian denies that our Saviour did exiſt before his Incarnation: but this Creed ſaith, <hi>That he was before all Ages, and made all things.</hi> I demand therefore of our Socinians, that they profeſs this Faith, or acknowledge themſelves the Perverters of Truth, and Debauchers of Antiquity. And indeed (like the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies)</hi> they rarely ſettle upon any place, but they ſo pollute it, that it wants a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Pen to cleanſe, and reſtore it to it ſelf. He hath then Preſumption only, but no colour of Proof, that the Apoſtles compoſed this Creed. We therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the next part of our Argument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though this Creed, called the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, doth not expreſly aſſert the Divinity of the Son and Holy Ghoſt, yet it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teaches both. For,</p>

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:59259:58"/>
1. It doth ſtile the Son his [only] Son; which Words indeed in themſelves import only this, That he is a Son in ſuch ſort as none elſe is, which the Socinian would perſwade reſpects not his Divinity, but his being born of a Virgin: but take them together with the Scriptures, whence they are themſelves taken, and by which they muſt be explained, and then it will ſufficiently appear that his only Son is a Son by Nature. Whence S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in Symb. l. 1. c. 2. <hi>Quando Unicum audis Dei filium, agnoſce Deum,</hi> the only Son of God is God. This ſome other Parts of our Diſpute will evince ſo far as the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath led us to this Argument. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the Holy Ghoſt, he thinks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be here pretended to prove him a Divine Perſon, excepting only the Phraſe of believing with the Prepoſition [in] which is ſet alſo before the Church, and therefore can aſcribe a Divinity to the one no more than to the other.</p>
               <p>But his Thoughts are very ſhort, and dull. For though this hath been a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Error, which ſome at this day will hardly be drawn from; yet we declare
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59259:58"/>
that we neither do, nor need for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing this Doctrine, hold any ſuch force in this Phraſe. See Dr. <hi>Hammod</hi>'s <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Catechiſm,</hi> lib. 5. Dr. <hi>Peirſon,</hi> and <hi>Heylen</hi> upon this Article, who abſolutely deny it; becauſe not this Creed only, but all Antiquity apply it to Men, and ſo do the Sacred Scriptures. They inſtance in <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 31. <hi>The People believed [in] the Lord and [in] Moſes;</hi> and 1 Sam. 27. 20. <hi>Achiſh believed [in] David.</hi> To which we add that of our Bleſſed Saviour <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 45. <hi>Moſes</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>in whom ye believe,</hi> or truſt, as we tranſlate it.</p>
               <p>They, with <hi>Muſculus,</hi> and others, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Notion to S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Jerom,</hi> whoſe Tranſlation firſt omitted the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in theſe Texts of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which other Tranſlations follow.</p>
               <p>A little before theſe Fathers <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> acknowledges the Prepoſition in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations of his time, but yet ſaith this Phraſe ought to be applied to none but the Lord; for the People did believe in <hi>Moſes</hi> not as <hi>Moſes,</hi> but as a Type of the Lord, and conſequently this did not terminate in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> but did refer ultimately to the Lord.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59259:59"/>
But he did not conſider that <hi>Achiſh</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>David,</hi> but he could not believe in <hi>David</hi> as a Type of the Lord, when he knew neither the Lord, nor that <hi>David</hi> was any Type at all. Hence <hi>Aſhwel</hi> took his Notion of the Peoples believing in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> as <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to the Lord; but there could be no ſuch ſubordinate Faith in this Heathen Prince, who yet <hi>believed in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> This was therefore an Error growing and ſetling it ſelf in the Church ſometime before <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Auſtin;</hi> but however it was theſe two that fixed the Point, and by that Omiſſion in that Tranſlation, as well as otherwiſe occaſioned others to ert with them.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay then, where, or how doth this Creed teach the Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt? I anſwer that the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt are put into this Creed as equally Objects of Faith and Worſhip with the Father; and this is the very thing that declares the Divinity of both. Nor is this from Men, but from God; for it was ſo done upon the ſpecial Precept of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour in the form of Baptiſm, which is the Original of all Creeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:59259:59"/>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why do Men believe the H. Ghoſt? But obſerve, he doth not here Diſpute from the ſole force of that Phraſe of <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in,</hi> but from our believing in the Holy Ghoſt as well as in the Father, which makes the Bleſſed Spirit equally with the Father a ſharer in our Faith, and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this ſenſe is <hi>Hila. Pict.

               <p>And indeed there is no ſuch Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in the World as to teach that we believe in God, in a Creature, and a ſimple Power; that he, who will not give his Glory to another, ſhould ſet a meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a naked Power, or Inſpiration, which is no Perſon, equal with himſelf in the Faith and Adoration of his People.</p>

But the careleſs, or deſigned Omiſſion of 'em is neceſſarily true, becauſe the 4<hi>th</hi> Age wanted them, after St <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the 3<hi>d</hi> Age had 'em.

               <p>2 They plead, that <hi>V.</hi> 7. is not in the <hi>Syriac,</hi> nor <hi>Arabick,</hi> whence ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the whole.</p>

Whence <hi>Beza</hi> (whom <hi>Letter</hi> 4, p. 152 quotes on his ſide) ſaith both muſt be expunged, or reteined together; and then concludes for the reteining both. And indeed this Caſe is ſo clear, that ſince the <hi>Socinians</hi> receive <hi>V.</hi> 8, they muſt receive <hi>V.</hi> 7. too, or renounce their own reaſon.</p>
               <p>We proceed to confirm the whole Verſe to be authentick.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

For ſuch a Likeneſs between Text and Text, is as good an Argument (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the proportion of Matter) to prove that each have the ſame Author, as it is between that Goſpel and his Epiſtle; But all Learned Men allow of this Argument, therefore the <hi>Socinian</hi> muſt allow of that, or differ from the World of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they do already from the World of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Learned Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> in his Letter from <hi>Zurie,</hi> obſerves
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59259:62"/>
that among Ten Copies he had ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, Nine had either the 7<hi>th V.</hi> or St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Epiſtle, or Preface, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dems the Omiſſion, while One only wanted both. Therefore among Ten Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies one only was purely <hi>Arian,</hi> or <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian;</hi> becauſe the Omiſſions in them that wanted, are condemned not only by that Epiſtle, or preface, but by them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo who added that Epiſtle or Preface to thoſe Copies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppoſitions grant nothing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſe we, that this Text it ſelf is not authentick; yet the Matter of it is taught by all thoſe Scriptures, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Divinity of the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghoſt, and the Exiſtence of but one God; for they, taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do aſſert that <hi>theſe Three are One;</hi> that is, <hi>One God,</hi> or <hi>One in Nature,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the <hi>Socinian</hi> a Man of that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he pretends, he could not think the expunging this Text out of the Sacred Canon, of ſo much moment, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others taken together ſpeak the ſame thing. He is then imployed about a Work he can never effect; or if effected, yet can do him but little, if any ſervice.

For which reaſons they betake them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves to other Methods.</p>
               <p>For they farther plead,<hi> If this Text be Authentick yet it cannot intend one in Nature, but One in Teſtimony, becauſe each verſe ſpeaks of each three as Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> True, each intend Teſtimony, as <hi>Beza Calvin, Eraſmus</hi> and others ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: But this doth not prove that <hi>v</hi> 7. intends no more; nor do theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Exclude an Unity of Nature. But the variation of the Phraſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a reſtriction of the matter. For <hi>v.</hi> 7. ſaith, <hi>the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, are One;</hi> which is equally extendible to Nature, and Teſtimony: But <hi>v.</hi> 8. ſaith, <hi>the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, agree in One:</hi> Which is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable not to Nature, but to Teſtimony, eſpecially where Teſtimony is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, or evidently intended; therefore we underſtand the former of One in Nature, and Teſtimony both: elſe we do not take the Phraſe in its full lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, nor make it comport with thoſe other Texts, which declare the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature of Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt: And yet that theſe three are
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59259:63"/>
but One True, and Almighty God, becauſe that Nature is numerically one, in which they all agree: But we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the latter of Teſtimony only, becauſe the phraſe deſigns no more, nor do any other Scriptures declare that the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, do agree in Nature, as the other do.</p>
               <p>But they inſiſt thus,<hi> The Expounding, </hi>v. 7.<hi> of Nature, doth loſe the deſign of theſe Texts, which ſpeak of Testimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Expounding it of Nature only, excluſive of Teſtimony, would have gave ſome colour of Reaſon to his Objection: But we Expound it both of Nature, and Teſtimony too; which Expoſition doth not loſe, but ſecure the deſign of this Text. For ſince they are One in Nature, and that Nature is Divine, they muſt be One in Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that Teſtimony muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible too; becauſe three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are one in Nature, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agree in a falſe Teſtimony, nor diſagree in that Teſtimony they give.</p>
               <p>Can we now think that this Doctrine, which teaches <hi>there are Three, who are but one God,</hi> is falſe, and impoſſible;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59259:64"/>
when it is ſo evidently founded on this, and other concurring Texts, which are the Word of Truth; and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can teach nothing which is falſe and impoſſible? If any thing we teach ſeems abſurd, and contradictory; or falſe and impoſſible (as the Letter words it) it is not from the Doctrine it ſelf, but from the <hi>Socinians</hi> Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of it. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſay we teach that <hi>there are but One;</hi> hereby ſuggeſting to others, and arguing themſelves, as if we mean in <hi>One reſpect only;</hi> which is indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. Whereas we teach, that <hi>Three</hi> in one reſpect are but <hi>One</hi> in another; which (according to their own Doctrine) takes away the Impoſſibility. For the <hi>Socinian</hi> himſelf grants us, upon theſe Words, <hi>I and my Father are One,</hi> that <hi>Two</hi> in one reſpect may be but <hi>One</hi> in another: And if <hi>Two may be One,</hi> why not <hi>Three?</hi> Since the difficulty lies not between <hi>Two</hi> and <hi>One,</hi> but between a <hi>Plurality</hi> whether they be <hi>Two,</hi> or <hi>Three,</hi> and <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> They allow the <hi>Thing,</hi> it is only the <hi>Modus,</hi> or <hi>Manner,</hi> how <hi>Two,</hi> or <hi>Three,</hi> can be but <hi>One,</hi> in which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59259:64"/>
we differ. Therefore ſince we ſo far agree, they ought to ſet forth how we hold <hi>Three to be hut One,</hi> together with our Reaſons for this Doctrine; which would lead even a prejudiced Reader to ſome deliberation: and not by a partial and Sophiſtical Repreſentation, make our Doctrine ſeem <hi>prima facie,</hi> abſurd and impoſſible, to the end they may huff off all conſideration of it.</p>
               <p>Indeed their manner of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among Men; but if ours is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded on <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> as we maintain it is, the <hi>ſingularity of the thing</hi> is not able to deſtroy the <hi>Thing it ſelf;</hi> and therefore ought in Juſtice to be ſo propoſed, as to leave Men to examine and conſider it; and not to be rejected without either.</p>
               <p>2. They ſay,<hi> Let. </hi>p. 159. we teach there are<hi> Three Perſons, who are ſeverally, and each of them the true, and moſt high God; </hi>and<hi> yet there is but One true, and most high God.</hi>

               <p>The Church indeed uſes the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Perſonal</hi> and <hi>Eſſential;</hi> that they are <hi>Three Perſonally,</hi> and but <hi>One Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially;</hi> that is, they are <hi>Three Perſons,</hi> and but <hi>One God.</hi> Not that theſe Terms are fully, and ſo clearly expreſſive of this Myſtery, as to remove all Cavils and Difficulties; but that ſhe may (the beſt ſhe can) expreſs her own Senſe, the Senſe of Antiquity, and the import of thoſe Scriptures that reſpect a Trinity. Let them give us more proper, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Terms, and we will uſe them; but let them not reject a Divine Truth for the ſake of thoſe Terms which He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie hath forced us to make uſe of.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This method of theirs implies a whole train of Abſurdities, for we are to prove, Firſt, [That] a thing is; and then [how] it is: If we prove

the former, that muſt be granted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe proved; though we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to prove the Latter. But they (contrary to all the Rules of Art, and method) require us to prove [how] it is; in order to their believing [that] it is: And do reject that part, which is proved, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the other is not. According to this method they muſt deny a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things, which they ſee, which all Mankind will ſay is abſurd with a witneſs.</p>
               <p>They ſay p. 158,<hi> that Interpretation of Scripture can never be true, that holds forth either a Doctrine, or a Conſequence, that is abſurd, contradictory, or Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We readily grant it, and ſuch is that of the Anthropomorphites mentioned in the next Page. For God is a Spirit, but not a Body. Becauſe body is compounded of parts, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Diſſolution, and cannot be in all places at once; therefore thoſe Scriptures, which aſcribe humane parts to God, cannot be true in a literal ſenſe; but only in an improper one.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59259:66"/>
And when theſe Men have proved ſuch an abſurdity, contradiction, ot impoſſibility in the Doctrine of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we will diſpute no more.</p>
               <p>They may indeed prove that three Men cannot be one; or one Man three; but as the Learned Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> obſerves, they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove that an infinite Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not communicate it ſelf to three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Subſiſtences, without ſuch a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as is among created Beings: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Finite capacity can never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Powers, and Operations of an infinite Nature. So abſurd are theſe Men as to decry revealed Truths for abſurd, and impoſſible, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot underſtand them. Should they do the like in natural things, they would quickly become the contempt of Mankind.</p>
               <p>We are not aſhamed to own a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the Divine Nature, when we find little but Myſtery in common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture her ſelf. Nor can we think it unreaſonable that God ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to believe that a thing is; though he hath not told us how it is;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59259:67"/>
any more than it is unreaſonable that Nature ſhould oblige us to aſſent, where the moſt refined reaſon can find no place of Entrance.

               <p>But we muſt declare it not abſurd only, but blaſphemous too, to deny what God hath told us, only becauſe he hath not told us more; or not baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled our Cavils by a demonſtration; as if, they dare not believe him any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they can ſee.

that by way of contempt from the <hi>Jews,</hi> as they afterwards were <hi>Galilaeans</hi> by the Apoſtate.</p>
               <p>They are indeed branded for a Sect in the place quoted, but not as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty broke off from the body of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but as the Church of Chriſt now ſeparated from the <hi>Jews.</hi> I beſeech you then what peculiar honour, and advantage can the <hi>Socinians</hi> claim to themſelves from hence, was the thing they plead true, when, as Chriſtians, they have this honour, but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with others; and, as <hi>Sorinians,</hi> can pretend to but one of the ſmalleſt ſhares of it?</p>

But had this Letter purſued Truth, and not the ſupport of an Error, it would likewiſe have told the Reader, that upon <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. <hi>The Word was God;</hi> he aſſerts that there is <hi>Divinam Eſſentiam tribus perſonis Communem;</hi> a Divine Eſſence common to three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Which is all we contend for; and which alone ſpeaks <hi>Eraſmus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as true a <hi>Trinitarian,</hi> as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed.</p>
               <p>His Paraphraſe upon this clauſe [in the beginning was the Word] ſaith, the Eternal Word was with the Eternal Father] yet by the <hi>Word</hi> he underſtands not the Command, Power or Wiſdom of God, but a Perſon, as appears from the laſt quotation before this; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he here aſſerts both the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality, and Eternity of the Word, which is the very Doctrine we teach.</p>
               <p>John 8. 5, 8. <hi>before</hi> Abraham <hi>was,</hi> I am, he renders, <hi>Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon theſe words he quotes St. <hi>Austin,</hi> who gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thus, <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>made,</hi> but Chriſt <hi>is;</hi> that denotes a Creature, this a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eternally exiſting.</p>
               <p>It is plain then that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> taught a Trinity. And certainly he would not think that the <hi>ignorant, and dull ſide of the queſtion</hi> (as the Letter ſpeaks) which he teaches for Orthodox Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. All the difference between him and our ſelves is this; that we agree in the ſame Doctrine, but differ only in ſome of thoſe Mediums that ſhould prove it. For which reaſon he ought to be read with caution and judgment.</p>
               <p>The Letter ſaith that this Author in his <hi>Scholia</hi> on the third tome of St. <hi>Jerom's</hi> Epiſtles, <hi>denies that the Arians are Hereticks.</hi>
