            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR diſtreſſes in our Religion and Liberties being of late more
preſſing then we were able to beare; our Supplications and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,
which were the remedies uſed by us for our reliefe, were
after many delayes and repulſes, anſwered at laſt with the terrors
of an Army comming to our borders; A peace was concluded,
but not obſerved: And when we did complain of the breach, and
ſupplicat for the performance, our Commiſſioners were hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated;
new and great preparations were made for war; and many
acts of hoſtility done againſt us, both by Sea and land. In this caſe
to ſend new Commiſſioners or ſupplications, were againſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
&amp; hopeleſse; To maintain an Army on the borders is above our ſtrength, &amp; cannot be a
ſafety unto us by Sea: To retire homeward, were to call on our Enemies to follow us, &amp; to
make our ſelves &amp; our Countrey, a prey by land, as our Ships &amp; goods are made at Sea. We
are therefore conſtrained at this time to come into <hi>England,</hi> not to make warre, but for ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our relief and preſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Duetie</hi> obligeth us to love <hi>England</hi> as our ſelves: Your grievances are ours; The preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or ruine of Religion &amp; Liberties, is common to both Nations: We muſt now ſtand or
fall together. Suffer not therefore malice &amp; calumnie to prevaile ſo far as to perſwade, that we
come to make warre, <hi>Wee call Heaven and Earth to witneſſe,</hi> that we are far from ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
&amp; that we have no purpoſe to fight, except we be forced, &amp; in our own defence (as we
have more fully expreſſed in our large <hi>Declaration</hi>) we come to get aſſurance of the injoying
of our Religion &amp; Liberties in peace againſt invaſion: and that the authors of all our grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
&amp; yours being tryed in Parliament, &amp; our wrongs redreſſed, the two Kingdomes
may live in greater love &amp; unitie then ever before, which to our common rejoycing, wee
may confidently expect from the goodnes of God, if the wicked counſels of <hi>Papiſts, Prelats</hi>
and other fire-brands their adherents be not more harkned unto, then our true and honeſt
Declarations.</p>
            <p>And where it may be conceived, that an Army cannot come into <hi>England</hi> but they will
waſte &amp; ſpoile; We declare, that no Souldiours ſhall be allowed to commit any out-rage, or
do the ſmalleſt wrong, but ſhalbe puniſhed with ſeverity: That we ſhal take neither meat nor
drink, nor any thing elſe, but for our moneyes: &amp; when our moneyes are ſpent, for ſufficient
ſurety, which by publique order ſhalbe given to all ſuch as ſhall furniſh us things neceſſary.
We neither have ſpared, nor will we ſpare our pains, fortunes, &amp; lyves in this cauſe of our
aſsurance &amp; your deliverance: &amp; therefore cannot look from any well-affected to trueth &amp;
peace, to be either oppoſed by force &amp; unjuſt violence in our peaceable paſsage, or to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by wilfull or uncharitable with-holding of meanes for our ſuſtentation on our
way. We are brethren: Your worthy Predeceſsors at the time of Reformation, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
us their help &amp; aſſiſtance. We have for many yeares lived in love: we have common
deſires of the purity of Religion and quietnes of both Kingdomes: our hopes are to ſee
better dayes in this Iland: our Enemies alſo are common: Let us not upon their ſuggeſtions
or our own apprehenſions, be friends to them, &amp; enemies to our ſelves: We deſire nothing
but what in the like extreamity (which we pray God your Nation never find) we would
moſt gladly upon the like Declaration grant unto you, comming with your Supplications
to the Kings Majeſtie, were he living amongſt us: and what ye would we ſhould doe unto
you, we truſt ye will be moved to doe even ſo unto us, that the bleſſing of GOD may reſt
upon both.</p>
