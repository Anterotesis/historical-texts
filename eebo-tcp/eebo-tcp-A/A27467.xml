         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s which might have strengthned us to beare those heavy

               </gap>haines they are making ready for us, though it were but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103711:3"/>
an assurance that we shall eat the bread for which our owne
Oxen plow, and with our owne sweat we reape; but this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
(it seemes) were a franchise beyond the Condition
they have <hi>resolu'd on the Question</hi> we ought to be in: For the
reason why they talke so <hi>Magisterially</hi> to us is this, we are
forsooth their worships slaves, bought with their money and
by consequence ought not to buy, or sell but with those they
shall Authorize with a few trifles to Coszen us of all for
which we toile and labour. If the whole Current of their
reasoning were not as ridiculous, as their actions have been
Tyrannicall and bloudy; we might wonder with what
browes they could sustaine such impertinent assertions: For
if you looke into it, the strength of their argument runs
onely thus: we have laid violent hands on your Land-Lord,
possess'd his Manner house where you used to pay your
rents, therfore now tender your respects to the same house
you once reverenced: I call my Conscience to witnes, I lie
not, I cannot in all their Declaration perceave a stronger
argument for what they vvould impose on us, then this which
I have now told you: They talke indeed of money laid out
on this Country in its infancy: I vvill not say how little,
nor how Centuply repaid, but will onely aske, was it theirs?
They who in the beginning of this warr were so poore, &amp;
indigent, that the wealth and rapines of three Kingdomes &amp;
their Churches too, cannot yet make rich, but are faine to
seeke out new Territories and impositions to sustaine their
Luxury amongst themselves. Surely Gentlemen we are
more slaves by nature, then their power can make us if we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
our selves to be shaken with these paper bulletts, &amp; those
on my life are the heaviest they either can or will send us.
'Tis true with us they have long threatned the Barbados, yet
not a ship goes thither but to beg trade, nor will they do to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103711:3"/>
us, if we dare Honourably resist their Imperious Ordinance.
Assuredly Gentlemen you have heard under what heavy
burthens, the afflicted <hi>English</hi> Nation now groanes, and calls
to heaven for releife: how new and formerly unheard of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
make the wifes pray for barrennes and their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
deafnes to exclude the cryes of their succourles,
staruing children: And I am confident you do believe, none
would long endure this slavery, if the sword at their throats
Did not Compell them to Languish under the misery
they howrely suffer. Looke on their sufferings with the
Eyes of understanding, and that will prevent all your teares
but those of Compassion. Consider with what prisons and
Axes they have paid those that have served them to the
hazard of their soules: Consider your selves how happy
your are and have been, how the Gates of wealth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
are shut on no man, and that there is not here an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
hand that dares to touch the substance of either poore
or rich: But that which I would have you cheifly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
with thankfullnes is: That God hath seperated you
from the guilt of the crying bloud of our Pious Souveraigne
of ever blessed memory: But mistake not Gentlemen part
of it will yet staine your garments if you willingly submit to
those murtherers hands that shed it: I tremble to thinke
how the oathes they will impose will make those guilty of
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, that have long abhor'd the traiterousnesse of the act:
But I confesse having had so frequent testimonies of your
truths and courages, I cannot have a reasonable suspition
of any cowardly falling of from the former resolutions,
and have onely mentioned this last, as a part of my duty and
care of you, not of my reall doubts and feares: or if with
untryed men we were to argue on this subject, what is it
can be hoped for in a change, which we have not allready?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103711:4"/>
Is it liberty? The sun looks not on a people more free then
we are from all oppression. Is it wealth? Hundreds of
examples shew us that Industry &amp; Thrift in a short time may
bring us to as high a degree of it, as the Country and out
Conditions are yet capable of: Is it securety to enjoy this
wealth when gotten? With out blushing I will speake it, I
am confident theare lives not that person can accuse me of
attempting the least act against any mans property? Is it
peace? The Indians God be blessed round about us are
subdued; we can onely feare the Londoners, who would
faine bring us to the same poverty, wherein the Dutch
found and releived us; would take away the liberty of our
consciences, and tongues, and our right of giving and
selling our goods to whom vve please. But Gentlemen by
the Grace of God we will not so tamely part with our KING,
and all these blessings we enjoy under him; and if they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us, do but follow me, I will either lead you to victory,
or loose a life which I cannot more gloriously sacrifice they
for my loyalty, and your security.</p>

that we are guilty of those Horrid Crimes. Therefore

We conceave we may safely confesse all this, and yet not
run the Hazard of any misprision of guilt, nay we thinke,
this only testimony of theirs were sufficient to cleere us
from the Aspersions of Rebells, and Traitors, if we had no
other markes of innocency left us: For we say, we were
some of us sent, others permitted to come hither by the
gratious favour of our Pious KINGS, sworne to governe,
and be governed (as farr as possible the place was Capable
of) by the lawes of <hi>England;</hi> which lawes we have invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably
and sacredly kept as farr as our abilityes to execute
and our Capacityes to judge would permit us, and with
reason; for these lawes onely in such times of tumults
stormes, and tempests, can humanely prevent our ruines:
These lawes often enjoyned us the Oathes of Allegeance
and Supremacy, and they tell us, that no power on earth
can absolve or manumit us from our obedience to ou<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

that when we have don all vve can to auoyd it, we may
resist violence with force, and in a lawfull defence of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
destroy any that shall endeavour to take away our
lives or substance: These lawes vve professe are our guides
and do beleeve vve deserve punishment and infamy if we
vvillingly, or vvillfully deviate from them.</p>
            <p>Secondly suppose vve vvere such slaves by nature as to
be awed vvith the iron rods held over us, in what hand
