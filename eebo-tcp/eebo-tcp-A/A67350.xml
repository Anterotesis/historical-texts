            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere is no doubt but the sense of what this Nation hath suffered from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Bishops, hath produced these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and the apprehension Men have of suffering the like in time to come, make so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny desire the taking away of Episcopacy. But I conceive it is possible that we may now not take a right measure of the mindes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by these petitions, for when they subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them, the Bishops were armed with a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Commission, of making new Canons, imposing new oathes, and the like, but now we have disarmed them of that power: these Petitioners lately; did look upon Episcopacy, as a Beast armed with Hornes and Clawes, but now that we have cut and pared them, (and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96678:3"/>
may if we see cause, yet reduce it into nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower bounds) it may perhaps be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; Howsoever if they be still in passion, it becomes us soberly to consider the right use and antiquity thereof, and not to comply fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a generall desire, then may stand with a generall good, We have already show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Episcopacy, and the evils thereof, are mingled like water and oyle; We have also in part severed them.</p>
            <p>But I beleeve you will finde that our Lawes and the present Government of the Church are mingled like Wine and Water, so insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that the Abrogation of at least a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of our Lawes is desired in this Petition. I have often heard a Noble answer of the Lords commended in this House, to a proposition of like nature, but of lesse consequence, they gave no other reason of their refusall but this, <hi>Nolumus mutare leges Angliae:</hi> It was the Bishops, was so answered then, and it would become the dignitie and wisedome of this House, to answer the people now with a <hi>Nolumus mutare.</hi> I see some are moved with a number of hands against the Bishops, which I confesse, rather inclines Me to their defence, for I look upon Episcopacy, as a Counter-scarf, or outwork, which if it be taken by this assault of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and withall this Mysterie once revealed, that we must deny them nothing when they aske it thus in troopes, we may in the next
<pb facs="tcp:96678:3"/>
place, have as hard a taske to defend our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, as we have lately had to recover it from the prerogative. If by multiplying hands, and petitions, they prevail for an equality in things Ecclesiasticall, this next demand perhaps may be <hi>Leaegraria,</hi> the like equality in things Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Story tels us, that when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple began to flock about the Senate, and were more curious to direct and know what was done, then to obey, that Common-wealth soon came to ruine. Their <hi>Legem rogare</hi> grew quickly to be a <hi>Legem ferre,</hi> and after, when their Legions had found that they could make a Dictator, they never suffered the Senate to have a voyce any more in such Election. If this great Innovation proceed, I shall expect a flat and levell in learing too, as well as in Church preferments. <hi>Horos alit artes,</hi> for though it be true, that grave and pious Men do study for learning sake, and imbrace vertue for it self, yet it is as true, that youth (which is the season when learning is gotten) is not without ambition, nor will ever take paines to excell in any thing, when there is not some hope of excelling others in reward and dignity. There are two reasons chiefly alleadged against our Church Government. First Scripture, which (as some Men thinks) points out another form. Secondly, the Abuses of the present Superiors. For Scripture I will not dispute it in this place,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96678:4"/>
but am confident that when ever an equ all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Lands and Goods shall be desired, there will be as many places in Scripture found out, which seem to favour that, as there are now alleadged against the Prelacy or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment in the Church, And as for abuses where you are now in the Remonstrance told, what this and that poore man hath suffered by the Bishops, you may be presented with a thousand Instances of poor Men, that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hard measure from their Land-Lords, and of worldly Goods abused, to the injury of others, and disadvantage of the Owners, And therefore M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Speaker</hi> my humble Motion is, that we may settle Mens' mindes herein, and by a question declare our Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to reform, that is, not to abolish Episcopacy.</p>
