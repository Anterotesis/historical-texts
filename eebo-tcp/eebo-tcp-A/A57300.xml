            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A BRIEFE RELATION OF SIR WALTER RALEGH's <hi>Troubles, with the taking away of the Lands and Castle of</hi> Sherborne <hi>in</hi> Dorset, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHen King IAMES came into England, hee found Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> (by the favour of his late Mistresse Queen ELIZABETH) Lord Warden of the <hi>Stannaries,</hi> Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of <hi>Devonshire</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> Captain of the Guard and Governour of the Isle of <hi>Gersey;</hi> with a large Possession of lands both in England and Ireland. The King for some weeks used him with great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and was pleased to acknowledge divers Presents, which hee had received from him being in Scotland, for which hee gave him thanks. But finding him (as hee said himself) a Martiall man, addicted to Forreigne affaires, and great acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hee feared lest he shou'd engage him in a warre (a thing most hated and contrary to the Kings nature) wherefore hee began to look upon him with a jealous eye, especially after he had presented him with a Booke, wherein with great ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity he opposed the Peace with <hi>Spaine</hi> then in treaty, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading the King rather vigorously to prosecute the war with that Prince then in hand, promising (and that with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60758:4"/>
within few yeares to reduce the <hi>West-Indies</hi> to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. But Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh's</hi> enemies soon discovering the Kings humour, resolved at once to rid the King of this doubt and trouble, &amp; to enrich themselves with the lands and offices of Sr. <hi>Walter Ralegh.</hi> Wherfore they plotted to accuse him, and the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> (a simple passionate man but of very Noble birth and great possessions) of high treason. The particulars of their accusation I am utterly ignorant of (and I think all men borth then and now living) only I find in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall terms, they were accused for plotting with the Spaniard to bring in a forreigne Army, and Proclaime the <hi>Jnfanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> Queene of <hi>England;</hi> but without any Proofes, and the thing it self as ridiculous as impossible. How ever Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was condem<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed without any witnes brought in against him, and the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> who was pretended to have accused him barely in a letter, in another letter to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Walt. Ralegh</hi> upon his salvation cleered him of all treason or treasonable actions either against King or state to his knowledge, which original letter is now in the hands o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Mr. <hi>Carew Ralegh</hi> son of Sr. <hi>Walter</hi> to bee produced at any time. Upon this Condemnation, all his lands and offices were seazed and himself committed close prisoner to the <hi>Tower,</hi> but they found his Castle of <hi>Sherborne,</hi> and the lands thereunto belonging to be long before entailed on his children, so that hee could not forfeit it but during his own life. And the King finding in himself the iniquity of Sir <hi>Walters</hi> condemnation, gave him all what hee had forfeited again, but still kept him close Prisoner, seven years after his imprisonment, he enjoyed <hi>Sherborn</hi> at which time it fell out, that one Mr. <hi>Robert Car,</hi> a young Scotch Gent: grew in great favor with the King and having no fortune, they contrived to lay the foundation of his future greatnesse upon the ruines of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh.</hi> Wherupon they called the conveyance of <hi>Sherborn</hi> in question in the Exchecquer chamber, and for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60758:4"/>
want of one single word (which word was found not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the Paper-book and was onely the oversight of a Clerk) they pronounced the Conveyance invalide, and <hi>Sherborn</hi> forfeited to the crown, a judgement easily to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen without witchcraft, since his chiefest judge was his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test enemie, and the case argued between a poore friendlesse Prisoner and a King of England.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Sherborne</hi> given to Sir <note place="inline">She was the onely Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sir <hi>Nicholas lTHrock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton,</hi> who was arraigned in <hi>Q. Maryes</hi> time and qun; see <hi>Fox</hi> his Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> 
               <hi>Robert Car</hi> (after Earl of <hi>Somerset;</hi>) the <hi>Lady Ralegh</hi> with her Children, humbly and earnestly Petitioning the King for compassion on her and hers, could obtaine no other answer from him, but that hee mun have the land, hee mun have it for <hi>Car.</hi> She being a woman of a very high spirit, and Noble birth and breeding, fell downe upon her knees with her hands heaved up to heaven, and in the bitternesse of spirit beseeched God Almighty to look upon the justice of her cause, and punish those who had so wrongfully exposed her and her poore children to ruine and beggery. What hath happened since to that royall Family is too sad and disastrous for me to repeat, and yet too visible not to be discerned. But to proceed: Prince HENRY hearing the King had given <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi> to Sir <hi>Robert Car,</hi> came with some anger to his Father, desiring hee would be pleased to bestow <hi>Sherborn</hi> upon him, alledging that it was a Place of great strength and beauty, which hee much liked, but indeed with an intention to give it hack to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> whom hee much esteemed.</p>
            <p>The King who was unwilling to refuse any of that Princes desires, (for indeed they were most commonly delivered in such language as sounded rather like a demand then an intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) granted his request; and to satisfie his Favorite gave him five and twenty Thousand pounds in ready money, so farre
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60758:5"/>
was the King or Crown from gaining by this Purchase. But that Excellent Prince within a few Moneths was taken away, how and by what means is suspected by all, and I fear was then too well known by many. After his death the King gave <hi>Sherborn</hi> againe to Sr. <hi>Robert Car,</hi> who not many yeers after by the name of Earle of <hi>Somerset</hi> was arraigned and co<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for poysoning Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> and lost all his lands. Then Sr. <hi>John Digbie</hi> nov Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> begged <hi>Sherborn</hi> of the King and had it. Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> being of a vigorons constitution, and perfect health, had now worne out sixteen yeers Imprisonment, and had seen the disastrous end of all his greatest enemies; so that new persons, and new interests now springing up in Court hee found means to obtaine his liberty, but upon condition to go a voyage to <hi>Guiana</hi> in discoverie of a Gold mine; that unhappie voyage is well known (almost) to all men, and how hee was betrayed from the very beginning, his lett<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs and designes being discovered to <hi>Gondomar</hi> the Spanish Ambassador, whereby hee found such strong oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition upon the place, that though hee took and fired the town of <hi>St. Thomà,</hi> yet hee lost his eldest Son in that service, and being desperately sick himselfe was made frustrate of all his hopes.</p>
            <p>Immediately upon his returne home hee was made Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and by the violent pursuit of <hi>Gondomar</hi> and some others (who could not think their estates safe, while his head was upon his shoulders) the King resolved to take advantage of his former condemnation sixteen yeers past (being not able to take away his life for any new action) and, though hee had given him a Commssion under the Broad seal to execute mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall law upon his own Soldiers, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was conceived by the best Lawyers a full pardon for any offence committed before that time, without any further trouble of the law, cut off his head.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60758:5"/>
            <p>Here Iustice was indeed blind, blindly executing one and the same person upon one and the same Condemnation for things contradictorie; for Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was condemned for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a friend to the Spanyard, and lost his life for being their utter enemie. Thus Kings, when they will doe what they please, please not him they should, God, and having made their power subservient to their will, deprive themselves of that just power whereby others are subservient to them. To proceed; Mr. <hi>Carew Ralegh</hi> only Son of Sr <hi>Walter</hi> being at this time a youth of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 13. bred at <hi>Oxford,</hi> after 5-yeers came to Court, &amp; by the favor of the right Hon. <hi>Will:</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> his noble kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, hoped to obtain some redresse in his misfortunes; but the King not liking his countenance sayd, he appeared to him like the ghost of his Father, whereupon the Earle advised him to travaile, which he did untill the death of King <hi>James,</hi> which, happened about a yeer after. Then comming over, and a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament sitting, he according to the custome of this Land, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed himself to them by Peti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion to be restored in blood, thereby to enable him to inherit such Lands as might come unto him either as heyr to his Father or any other way, but his Petition having been twice read in the Lords house, King <hi>Charles</hi> sent Sir <hi>Iames Fullerton,</hi> (then of the Bed-chamber) unto Mr. <hi>Ralegh</hi> to command him to come unto him, and being brought into the Kings chamber by the sayd Sir <hi>James,</hi> the King, (after using him with great civilitie) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing told him plainly, that, when hee was Prince, hee had promised the Earle of <hi>Bristol</hi> to secure his title to <hi>Sherborn</hi> against the heyrs of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh;</hi> wherupon the Earl had given him then Prince ten thousand pounds, that now hee was bound to make good his promise being King; that therefore unlesse hee would quit all his right and title to <hi>Sherborn,</hi> he neyther could nor would passe his bill of restauration. Mr. <hi>Ralegh</hi> urged the justice of his cause, that hee desired onely the libertie of a Subject, and to be left to the Law, which was

               </gap>ions, the King was resolute in his denyall, and so left him, After which Sir <hi>James Fu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lerton</hi> used many arguments to perswade submission to the Kings will, as the impossibilitie of contesting with Kingly power, the not being restored in blood, which brought along with it so many inconveniences, that it was not possible without i<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to possesse or enjoy any lands or estate in this Kingdom, The not being in condition, if his cloke were taken from his back, or hat from his head, to sue for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. All which things being considered, together with splendid promises of great preferment in Court, and particular favors from the King not improbable, wrought much in the mind of young Mr. <hi>Ralegh,</hi> who being a person not full twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeers old, left friendlesse and fortune-lesse, prevailed so far that hee submitted to the Kings will.</p>
            <p>Wherupon there was an Act passed for his restauration, and together with it a settlement of <hi>Sherborn</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> and in shew of some kind of recompense, four hundred pounds a yeere pension during life granted to Mr. <hi>Ralegh</hi> after the death of his Mother, who had that sum paid unto her during life in lieu of jointure.</p>
