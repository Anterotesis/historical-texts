            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Kings to death, when they commit murther?

               <p>To ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Law we ſpeak of was never extended unto or<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> underſtood of Kings, and therefore neither ought now to be extended unto, or underſtood of them; would be to ſay ſome what, but what is next to nothing. For, 1. who is able to give any ſufficient account that it was never, in no age, by no perſon, <hi>underſtood</hi> of Kings? That in point of execution it was never extended unto Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is but a ſlippery proof that it was never <hi>underſtood</hi> of them. Very poſſibly it was never (in ſuch a ſence) extended unto muſitians, or moris-dancers, yet this, if it could be proved, would be no proof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that therefore it was never <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood</hi> or meant of them. Beſides if the Law we ſpeak of never extended unto Kings in the execution of it, it is no great wonder; conſidering. 1. That there being but one King at a time in the whole nation, it can be no matter of wonder, that he ſhould not be a murtherer, which ſuppoſed, (I mean, that never any King of England heretofore, was, or was known to be a murderer) there was no poſſibilitie that the ſaid Law ſhould formerly have bin extended unto Kings in point of execution. 2. In caſe it could be proved that ſome former King, one, or more, were guiltie of murther, yet probably thoſe who were intruſted with the execution of the Law we ſpeak of, might connive either through fear, favour, flatterie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the like. In ſuch caſes as theſe, there was no opportunitie of extending this law in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, unto Kings Upon the ſame account it may well be, that however the Law ought in reaſon, equity, and according to the import of the letter and words of it, be <hi>underſtood,</hi> as well

To prove, that <hi>God gave not all men that freedom, which</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is the ſuppoſed foundation of that Doctrine, which places ſupreme power in the people,</hi> he alledgeth, <hi>that it is moſt certain that God did deſign and appoint Government.</hi> But this alledgement may ſtand, and yet his cauſe fall. For what though <hi>God deſign and appoint Government?</hi> doth it therefore follow, that <hi>all men (viz.</hi> collectively taken in their reſpective communities) were not naturally <hi>free,</hi> i. to chuſe, by what kind or form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they would be Governed, as whether by Kings, or by Counſel of State, or by popular Suffrage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. In caſe of either of the two former Governments, to chuſe what perſons they pleaſed, for the adminiſtration of that Government, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they thought good by Common conſent, to ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. 3. To proportion, limit, and circumſcribe that power, which they were to confer upon the Adminiſtratours of that Government they ſhould chuſe, for the exerciſe thereof, by what Laws, or Covenants they pleaſed; onely provided, that in all theſe they have a due reſpect unto, and make a competent proviſion for, the due and juſt end of Government; which is, the politique or civil welfare and good of the Governed? Doubtleſſe <hi>Gods appointment of Government,</hi> doth not any wayes inferre a reſtraint in civil or politique ſocieties or communities of men, in reſpect of any of theſe things. For if men ſet over themſelves any lawfull and juſt Government whatſoever, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for their Regulation in a politique way, they do not at all contravene <hi>Gods appointment concerning Government,</hi> but duly comport with it. But if the Doctours meaning be, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> he ſpeaks of (<hi>which placeth ſupreme power in the people</hi>) ſtands upon any ſuch <hi>foundation</hi> as this, that <hi>God gave all men freedom,</hi> either to doe what they liſt, or to live without all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; or that he <hi>gave a freedom</hi> to every, or to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

In which reſpect it is ſomewhat hard to gather it up clean, or fix into a regular body of an argument. Yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I ſhall not eclipſe any part of the glorie or ſtrength of it, by caſting it into this Hypotheticall form.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If no man by nature hath power over his own life, ſo as that he may lawfully kill, or deſtroy himſelf, and yet Kings have ſuch a power over the lives of all thoſe, that are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto them, then cannot this power be derived unto Kings by men, or from the people. <hi>Sed verum prius: ergo &amp; poſterius.</hi> The ſtrength of the conſequence, ſtands in the Authority of this topique Maxime: <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet:</hi> Nothing gives that to another, which it hath not it ſelf. And if the conſequence be tight, and will hold water, it is a clear caſe, that Regal, or the ſupreme power, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> not originally in the people; but conferred upon the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Ruler immediately by God.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To this Argument I anſwer, by denying the conſequence in the propoſition. The reaſon of my deniall, is this: becauſe though <hi>no man,</hi> [.i. no particular or individual perſon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered apart by himſelf,] <hi>hath by nature any ſuch power over his own life,</hi> as is here mentioned; yet as a Member of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, or politique ſociety of men, he hath, not ſimply a power, but a neceſſity lying upon him by way of duty, in order
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:111345:18"/>
to the peace and civil good of this community, to conſent with others, that his life alſo ſhall be taken from him by the hand of Juſtice, as well as any other mans, in caſe he ſhall wrong the community by any crime deſerving death. The power of life and death is <hi>eminently &amp; virtually</hi> in the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> collectively taken, though not <hi>formally.</hi> And though no man can take away his own life, or hath power over his own life, <hi>formally;</hi> yet a man, and a body of men, have power over their own lives, <hi>radically</hi> and <hi>virtually;</hi> in reſpect whereof they may render themſelves to a Magiſtrate &amp; to laws, which if they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, they muſt be in hazard of their lives: and thus they vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually have power of their own lives, by putting them under the power of good Laws for the peace and ſafety of the whole. This is evident in all thoſe, who either make, or conſent to the making of, any ſuch Laws, which inflict death, in any caſe of miſdemeanour deſerving it. Firſt, it is a clear caſe, that they, who are intruſted with a legiſlative power, for the good of that community, which intruſteth them, ſtand bound by way of duty, to enact, or conſent unto the continuation of Laws al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready enacted, for that puniſhing with death, ſuch and ſuch Tranſgreſſours againſt this Community, as Murtherers, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, Traitours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. As clear it is, that the perſons we ſpeak of, who are of duty to joyn in, and conſent unto, the making of ſuch Laws, are themſelves as Subject unto theſe Laws, being made, as other Members of the ſame community. 3. It is as little queſtionable, as either of the former, but that theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, both before, and at the time of their making, or conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto ſuch Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> clearly know, that themſelves are, muſt, and ought to be, thus ſubject unto them. Therefore it is a noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day truth, that men by nature have ſuch a <hi>power over their lives,</hi> as voluntarily according to a due courſe and proceſſe in Law, to expoſe them to the ſtroke of publick Juſtice, in caſe they ſhall offend that community, whereof they are Members, by any crime, or crimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worthy death. Nor hath the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any other power over the lives of any of his ſubjects, but that which is thus conditioned and limited. The King hath no power to take away the life of any of his ſubjects, without cauſe; no nor yet for every cauſe; nor indeed for any cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that onely, which by the Law is made puniſhable with death. Nor hath he any ſuch power over any of his ſubjects, or their lives, which enables him, to command any of them to be their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:111345:18"/>
own Executioners, though by Law guilty of death, yea and ſentenced accordingly. So that that principle, <hi>Niiil dat, quod non habet,</hi> ſhew no countenance at all to the Doctours argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> own any relation to it. Men have ſuch a <hi>power over their</hi> lives, as is veſted in Kings: nor could Kings have any ſuch <hi>power over them,</hi> as now they have, did not men themſelves inveſt them with it, and that in a regular and lawfull way. Men have by nature a right or power over their lives, whereby they may lawfully ſubmit them unto the ſword of a Lawfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and conſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in caſe they ſhall commit things pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable with death by the Law, they ſhall be taken from them thereby. And what power have Kings over them but onely (as hath been ſaid) according to the tenour of ſuch a ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and conſent, as this? Or upon what other account (at leaſt immediate) doth even this power it ſelf a cerve unto Kings, but by the equitable force and virtue of ſuch a ſubmiſſion and conſent from the people? The very image, tenour and form of the power, which Kings have over the lives of their ſubjects, plainly ſheweth it to be the off-ſpring, or naturall iſſue of that power, which themſelves by nature have over the ſame. And that men in ſome caſes, have not onely a power by nature, but even a neceſſity by Religion, to expoſe their lives unto death, is evident from that of the Apoſtle <hi>John; Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren.</hi> (1. John. 3. 16.) 1. To be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ready and willing <hi>to lay them down,</hi> upon any juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion</p>
               <p>Beſides, if the power, which the King hath over the lives of the people, were (as the Doctour ſuppoſeth) <hi>immediately from God,</hi> than he might lawfully execute the ſame, and take away the lives of men, without any mediating Direction, or warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from any Law, at leaſt from any politique or humane Law, whatſoever. For certain it is, that the execution of no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion <hi>immediately</hi> iſſued by God, ought to be ſuſpended upon, or determined or regulated by, any Commiſſion, or conſtitution of men. But whether the King hath any regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or juſt power over the lives of men, other than that, which is proportioned, formed, ſet out, and bounded by the Laws of that State, wherein he ruleth, I doe not much fear to refer to the arbitration of the Doctours him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:111345:19"/>Again, if the power of Kings over the lives of men were<note place="margin">Sect. 23</note> by immediate derivation from God, then muſt this power be uniform, of the <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

If ſo, then will it follow, either that there is no juſt power of this kind, I mean juſt in the compaſſe of it) in any King now reigning upon the earth; or, in caſe there be ſome one King whoſe power over the lives of his Subjects, is juſt, that the power, which is owned or exerciſed by all other Kings not being every waves commenſureable with this, is unlawfull and unjuſt.

Therefore they who affirm that that power, which any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular King in the world, claimeth, and exerciſeth, over the lives of his ſubjects, is by an immediate inveſtiture, or derivation from God, run an extream hazard of blaſpheming God, or at leaſt of aſcribing that to him, which is unworthy of him. Secondly, there being ſcarſely two Polities, States, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in the world, wherein the power claimed and exerciſed by their Kings, or Supreme Rulers, over the lives of their Subjects is every wayes commenſurable and co-extenſive, the one with the other, it muſt needs follow, that the power (in this kind) generally claimed and exerciſed by Kings, is irregular and unjuſt, and conſequently not of any <hi>immediate derivation from God.</hi>

To ſend them to the Scriptures, or Word of God, as to the Judicials of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the like, for their direction in this kind, is conſtructively to exauthorize States-men, and perſons of civil imployment, from legiſ-lation (at leaſt in criminall matters which concern the lives of men) and to intereſſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Clergie-men in that affair, at whoſe mouths the Law of God [.i. the mind of God in his Law] is to be ſought, and (of right) ſhould be found. So that the Doctours opinion concerning the <hi>immediate derivation</hi> of Kingly power from God, is of a very enſnaring nature unto Kings, of a diſturbing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto States, and directly tends, either to ſend this power into a land of darkneſſe, where it ſhall never be ſeen, or found, by any man, or elſe to make it as unnaturall and monſtrous, as Kings themſelves pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Once more (and ſo enough of this for the preſent) if the ſaid<note place="margin">Sect. 25</note> Opinion be Orthodox and Authentique, then can no act of the People contribute any thing in one kind or other, towards the inveſtiture of the King with that power, which he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their lives. This is evident. For that <hi>derivation</hi> which is <hi>immediate from God,</hi> can be no wayes aſſiſted, furthered, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by any creature, or ſecond means. But certain it is, that the derivation of that power we now ſpeak of, upon the King, is either properly effected, or at leaſt furthered, by an act of the people, and particularly either by that act of theirs, by which they elect, or elſe that, by which they create and make him King. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The aſſumption ſtands firm, upon this ground.

in ſuch, or ſuch a race or family, for their King, ſucceſſively, do not upon a vacancie of the Throne by death, expreſſe any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokement of that their grant or conſent. So then, the people muſt of neceſſity act, either by Electing, or by Creating the King, or both, in order to the inveſting of him with ſuch a power over the lives of his Subjects, as we ſpeak of, before he be inveſted herewith: which plainly ſhews, that this inveſtiture, or power, accrueth not unto him by any <hi>immediate derivation from God,</hi> but by the intervening (at leaſt) of the Act of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, either (as hath been ſaid) Electing, or Creating him, for their King, or both. And the Truth is, ſuppoſing that power over the lives of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hitherto ſo much ſpoken of, to be eſſentiall to the Kingly Office and Dignity, (which is, I queſtion not, the ready and round ſence of the Doctour) and withall, that this power is not <hi>derived</hi> thereunto by the people, but <hi>immediately from God,</hi> it undeniably follows, that the people have no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient intereſt or right of power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either to chuſe, or create, any King for themſelves. Nor can they aſſure themſelves, that that perſon, whom they chuſe, create, and call their King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is truly ſuch, or that he hath any power at all over the lifes of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſſe they ſuppoſe it to be conferred upon them by themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it being impoſſible (by what hath been argued to the contrary) that they ſhould have any aſſurance, that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him <hi>immediatly by God.</hi>

A Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration or Company convened together may Lawfully do many things relating to their body, which no ſingle perſon of them may doe; as (for example) they may diſcharge an Officer, whom they find unfaithfull in, or inſufficient for, the place, wherein he hath formerly related unto the Company, which no particular perſon amongſt them can, or ought, to doe.

Now it being the Intereſt or right of the people in their Repreſentatives, to make their Laws, it muſt needs be their right alſo, in the ſame capacity, to interpret them. If it be yet ſaid; yea but the King is intereſſed in making of Laws, as well as the people: therefore it belongs, as well unto him, as unto them, to interpret them. I anſwer, no: the King is not intereſſed in making, 1. in framing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or contriving Laws, but onely in ratifying or confirming them. That which he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:111345:23"/>
contributes towards the Laws, is onely the guift of his Royall aſſent; which ſuppoſeth them made, before they come at him. His Aſſent unto the Laws made by the people, is (in it ſelf, and ſimply conſidered) but a State formality, yet apprehended (it ſeems) of ſuch conſequence, that the people formerly, judged it meet, to conſtrain him by an oath at his Coronation to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit it.

So that when Kings turn Tyrants over their people, the people themſelves are competent Judges, though they be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the caſe their own, becauſe they are not in a capacitie of making an application or addreſſe, unto any other Judge, for redreſſe of their wrongs. Even as the late King took upon him to be Judge in his own caſe, when he ſentenced all thoſe, who ſerved in the Wars on the Parliaments ſide againſt him, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Traitours, and commanded execution accordingly. But whether in ſuch caſes, as thoſe lately ſpecified, where no recourſe can be had to other judges, or in what caſes ſoever, men do not ſin, ſimply by making themſelves judges in their own caſe (for who is there but in any caſe relating to him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to judge what of right belongs unto him?)

better ſentence of a competent Judge. 3. In not abiding (with patience) by the ſentence or award of a Judge, or Judges lawfully conſtituted and deputed for the cogniſance of their cauſe, upon a pretence or ſuppoſal of in-juſtice in it. Thus then it is as clear as the ſun, that the topique Authoritie of this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Par in parem non habet poteſtatem,</hi> reflects nothing, but peace, upon the Sentence paſſed upon the KING.</p>
               <p>Yea but (ſay ſome) we cannot approve the ſaid ſentence, as<note place="margin">Sect. 33</note> juſt, in reſpect of thoſe who awarded it. The Parliament, by whoſe Authority the High Court of Juſtice was erected, were no legitimate, or true Parliament, or Repreſentative of the people; nor in a capacity of acting in a Parliamentary way, a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of their members being deteined from them by force; and thoſe remaining, being under force.

               <p>If it be ſaid, Yea but the Members, who met and ſat in the<note place="margin">Sect. 34</note> Houſe, during the deteinment of their fellow-Members, did unworthily in not demanding theſe fellow-Members of theirs out of the hands of thoſe, who deteined them; or, in caſe of being denied in this kind in not refuſing to act in a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie way any further, untill they had been re-delivered unto them.

For it may very reaſonably be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether any Parliament were ever ſo free in the paſſing of any Act, but that they were under fear, either of the King, and his power and party, on the one hand, or of the people, and their diſcontent, on the other: and conſequently, whether ever any Parliament acted with ſuch preciſeneſſe of liberty or freedom, as that the genuine and native ducture of their judgements was no wayes touched or wrought upon by any influence of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or things, feared by them.</p>
               <p>If it be yet objected: yea but it was onely the Houſe of<note place="margin">Sect. 38</note> Commons, that voted the Erection of that Court of Juſtice, which gave ſentence againſt the King; The Houſe of Lords concurred not with it. Therefore the Authority of this Court,

All Authority, and Power of Government being origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally<note place="margin">Sect. 39</note> and fundamentally in the people (as hath been already proved at large) they have a juſt and legall power (in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, which is the Houſe of Commons, without the Lords) to act and do, whatſoever they rightly judge condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to their wealth and ſafety; eſpecially when the Lords ſhall refuſe to concurre with them in ſuch things.

ſo oft repeated in the Scriptures, ſo fully explained and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in this Diſcourſe, gave light in abundance unto the King, whereby to ſee and underſtand, that for thoſe very crimes and bloudy perpetrations, of which he was arreigned, his life was obnoxious to the hand of humane Juſtice, or rather of Divine Juſtice executable by the hands of men. So that if he were ignorant of his liableneſſe unto death for the miſdemeanours committed by him, it was <hi>Ignorantia Juris, non facti,</hi> which (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) excuſeth no man. Beſides, the frequent caſes and examples of Juſtice executed upon Kings by their Subjects, obvious as well in the Records of Scriptures, as in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of many Nations, (a firſt-fruit whereof hath been preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Treatiſe) were abundantly ſufficient to give the light of this information unto him, that if he ſinned againſt the bloud of his people, it would render him <hi>ipſo facto</hi> a child of death. Beſides, had he not defaced that writing, which was written by the finger of God himſelf in the tables of his own heart, here might he have read it in characters legible enough, that he that unjuſtly takes away the life of another, makes a preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture unto Juſtice of his own.</p>

            <p>In the mean time, I judged M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

The Truth is, that this poſition (in the ſence of the Authour, from whom, and wherein I cite it) is an Orthodox ſaying, and nothing more than what very learned Proteſtant writers themſelves, aſſert and hold (at leaſt in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and grounds, if not in plainneſſe of terms alſo; as I could readily prove, if it were a prize worth the running for, upon this occaſion.)</p>
            <p>What I argue touching the ſence and import of that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Sect. 12</note> Rom. 13. 1, 2. both from the context, and from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words themſelves of the Holy Ghoſt, (beſides the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſeverall Authors of his own beloved Intereſt) he (pag. 37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) balanceth and oppoſeth, partly with the conceits and words of men upon the place, partly with uncivill and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

But the reaſon by which he would prove this his aſſertion, is (in his own terms) as <hi>wild,</hi> as the aſſertion it ſelf unworthy. The <hi>concluſion I inferre from</hi> the ſaid Scripture, <hi>is point-blank to the word of God;</hi> why? Becauſe <hi>the Apoſtle Peter directs ſervants to be ſubject, not onely to the good and gentle; but to the froward,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:111345:61"/>Was there ever any man pretending to learning, and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Judgement, that ever reaſoned at ſuch a forlorn rate as this (unleſſe happly it were his neighbour M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Jenkin?</hi>) For doth not the ſtrength of his arguing lie in ſuch a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or notion, as this; what the word of God ſaith in one place, it muſt needs ſay in every place? Becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith ſo, or ſo, in ſuch a place; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaith the ſame thing in ſuch a place.

The two <hi>Hothams,</hi> Father and Son, being ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon by ſome of the Parliament forces, upon ſuſpicion of treachery, without any warrant or direction from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the fact was generally approved by the Parliament than in being; nor was there the leaſt muttering or queſtion made of any irregularity contracted by the Houſe thereby. By the way, this Act of the Parliament in juſtifying and approving the ſaid Act of their Souldiers, I mean the ſeizing, and violent detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two of their Members, without any warrant, order, or direction from them, onely upon ſuſpicion of treacherie, doth as far as any Parliament Authority extendeth, clearly and fully juſtifie the Army, in their ſecuring by a ſtrong hand ſuch of their Members, as were of late ſecured by them, upon the like preſumption or ſuſpicion, though without any particular or expreſſe order from the Houſe. And they, who with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Geree,</hi> Maſter <hi>Prynne,</hi> and ſome others, condemn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch the Army for this fact, offer no whit better meaſure to the Parliament it ſelf, in it's beſt, (at leaſt in it's moſt unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable) Conſtitution. For if it were lawfull yea and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable (as the Parliament in that capacitie we ſpeak of, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged it) for one party of the Army, to lay hold on and ſecure two of their Members onely upon ſuſpicion of treacherie, without any ſpeciall warrant from them, it muſt needs be as lawfull (yea and as commendable) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or another party of this Army, to do the like by others of them, though more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, upon the like grounds. If one Judge upon ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>icient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may give Sentence of death againſt two murtherers; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Judge of the ſame capacitie, may upon like evidence, give a like Sentence againſt five. Offendours are never the more priviledged by Law for being many. That the grounds of ſuſpicion, upon which the Army of late proceeded to the ſeizure of their prey, were pregnant and ſtrong enough to bear ſuch an Action, hath had (I preſume) proof and demonſtration in abundance, in the ſecond Treatiſe (beſides a former, intituled, <hi>Right and Might well met.</hi>)</p>
