            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Piece which now entertains your Eie, was originally (if I may ſo term it) a <hi>Rhapſody</hi> of Caſes, wherein the Author did not ſo much conſult his Method, as the choice of his Matter: for as they proceeded from his hand they had no Coherence amongst themſelves, except ſuch as were voucht to warrant the Reaſons of others: and moſt of them too more naturally referring to their own proper Heads and
<pb facs="tcp:42263:3"/>
Diviſions, under which it was neceſſary to reduce them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that form I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to my ſelf. So that it was not difficult to preſage how great a Trouble muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred in the Attempt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ſo great a Confuſion into any conſiderable Order. But imagining the effects of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour might reward my pains, I was eaſily prompted to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it for my own private ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodation, and not out of any vain glorious deſign to obtrude it upon the world; for it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well known I oppoſed a three years importunity to render it publick; yet <hi>in fine</hi> conſidering that my own Reputation ſtood reſponſible no further, than for
<pb facs="tcp:42263:3"/>
giving it this ſhape into which you now ſee it form'd, I thought I might with the greater free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom comply with the deſires of thoſe who ſo long, and ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, had invited it to the Preſs.</p>
            <p>For the work it ſelf, it hath gained a very fair reputation; For I know no book that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends meerly upon the ſtrength of its own reaſon as this doth, that ever was entertained with ſo great an eſteem as this hath been by all perſons that pretend to the knowledge of the Law. But the moſt ſignal mark of its worth was ſet upon it by that perſon who in the Fabrick of thoſe everlaſting Monuments of his Fame, his <hi>Reports</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:42263:4"/>
               <hi>Inſtitutes</hi> hath vouchſafed to honour this Treatiſe ſo far as to make himſelf indebted to it for many of his Materials, as will be obvious and viſible to any mans obſervation that hath the leaſt acquaintance with them.</p>
            <p>You will find upon a ſerious peruſall, that few of the Caſes herein contained are any where elſe to be found, unleſſe they were borrowed from hence. That the Author was a perſon of a moſt refined <hi>Theory</hi>: And that the work it ſelf is a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme</hi> of the ſublimeſt ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Law; wherein there is nothing Vulgar, Trite, or uſuall, and yet every thing uſefull. You will perceive that
<pb facs="tcp:42263:4"/>
in the Caſes that are controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as ſome of them be, the Arguments on both ſides are derived from ſuch apt and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Topicks, and the Conteſt managed with ſo even and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall a ſtrength of Reaſon, that it is often left a meaſuring caſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Generall Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, this Piece will oblige the Students of the Law with a more particular Advantage; for out of it they may furniſh themſelves, not onely with <hi>Quaeres</hi> and <hi>Moot Points</hi> for their Exerciſes in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Societies, the want whoreof is ſo generally lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but they will alſo find many of theſe <hi>Problemes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
<pb facs="tcp:42263:5"/>
upon either ſide. So that they are not onely accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with Subjects for their quarrels; but are alſo arm'd with weapons both offenſive and defenſive.</p>
            <p>It would too much reſemble flattery for any man to aſſert the infallibility of his Treatiſe in every particular. It is a prerogative to which few books in the Law, I had almoſt ſaid none, ever arrived; For <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton</hi> who no doubt, as he writ in the quality of a Father, was moſt accurate in his Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leſt the Judgement of his Son might derive a blot from his own pen. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the work is conſidered
<pb facs="tcp:42263:5"/>
as the moſt accompliſhed piece of that nature that was ever yet extant, and his honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Interpreter makes his name and the Law <hi>Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>; Yet he himſelf ſhuts up that Diſcourſe with ſo modeſt an <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> that it plainly implies his own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of it was very different from that which the World hath ſince beſtowed upon it: And the ſame Learned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator, although he was ſufficiently poſitive and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory in vindicating the Authority of his Author: yet when he comes to reflect upon his own Labours, he is found to make uſe of the ſame <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> for thoſe Truths which
<pb facs="tcp:42263:6"/>
depend meerly upon Fancie and Opinion, without the aſſiſtance of any known Principle to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, as many Caſes in the Law do; have a certain fatal period beyond which they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſurvive: and from hence it is, that what was reaſon an Age ſince ceaſeth to be ſo now: And ſome Deciſions have a ſhorter Date; for the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are given in one Court, and that too upon the moſt ſolemn Debates, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times Reverſt in another before the breath is cold that pronounced them: For when the Determination of a caſe muſt be fetcht out of its ſelf, there is nothing ſo uncertain and mutable as the Concluſions
<pb facs="tcp:42263:6"/>
that are made thereupon. And thus it fares with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe caſes, being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by ſome particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which leads them out of the common Road, and diſtinguiſheth them from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. So that when I conſider the Niceties that are contained in it, and how critically they are decided, I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire ſo many of them are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for Law. I confeſſe you will meet with ſome paſſages that are not agreeable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinions of this Age, but moſt that are, which puts me in mind of a Character that was given it by an ingenuous and intelligent perſon in the Law, That there are in it <hi>multa
<pb facs="tcp:42263:7"/>
falſa, plura vera, plurima in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genioſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, although my particular Intereſt in this piece be ſo inconſiderable, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rationally affect any repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by it: Yet if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that relates to my own endeavours that may acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally purchaſe a generous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from any ingenuous ſpirit, it ſhall be an ample compenſation for the labour and pains that have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon it.</p>

broken; for, when he accepted the Rent, he did not receive it as a debt; (for an Action of Debt would not lie in that caſe) but as a Rent. And it cannot be a Rent unleſs the Leaſe continues. So if a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Iſſue in tail, or an Infant accept a Rent reſerved by the Husbund, &amp;c.

               <p>The Husband and Wife make a Leaſe for life, reſerving a Rent; the Husband dies, the Wife accepts the Rent from the Leſſee: ſhe ſhall not avoid the Remainder; for they are both but one Eſtate, and an Agreement cannot be to parcel of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.

               <p>A man makes a Feofment upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Feoffee makes a Leaſe for life, and grants the reverſion to the Feoffor.

               <p>A gift in tail is made to the Donee, and the Heirs males of his Body: and for want of ſuch Iſſue, the remainder to him and the Heirs females of his body; the Donee makes a Leaſe for years, reſerving a rent, and dies without Iſſue male. If the Heir female accepts the rent, ſhe ſhall be bound; for the Leaſe iſſued out of both the eſtates. But if the Heir male had made the Leaſe, the Heir female cannot make it good by acceptance.</p>

And ſome think the Releaſe could not give the Right in Fee, which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſor had to the Releaſee himſelf, for then in a manner he might Releaſe to himſelf, and if the Releaſe inures but as a Confirmation, then without queſtion the Heir ſhall be remitted, and ſhall hold it diſcharged; but if the Remainder had been appointed in tail to him who had it before in fee, the Remainder over in fee, then the Releaſe ought to inure to the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in tail, and alſo to the Fee, and then if the laſt fee be fortified, the meſne Remainder is eſtabliſhed, and ſo the Releaſe inures to himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Son makes a Leaſe to the Father for life, who makes a Leaſe for life to <hi>A.</hi> the Remainder in fee ſimple to the Son, the Son grants a Rent Charge out of the Remainder, and after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſes to <hi>A.</hi> and his Heirs all his Right in the Land, the Father and <hi>A.</hi> die, if his Iſſue ſhall hold it charged? firſt, it is cleer, that the Right Fee is dive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and a tortious Fee ſetled in the Son all at one Inſtant, as if Tenant in tail makes a Leaſe for life, the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance

of the eſtate in tail is deveſted, and a fee ſimple veſted all at one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So if the Husband makes a Leaſe for life of the Wives Land, the fee which the Husband had in right of his Wife is deveſted, and a new foe in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own right veſted at the ſame time. So in the firſt caſe; then when it is granted out of the Reverſion, it is all one as if it had been granted out of the Remainder, becauſe a Reverſion and Remainder agree in ſubſtance, <hi>viz.

But others think, that in as much as by the grant of the Rent charge he hath agreed to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, and ſo to the Livery, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now enter upon the Tenant for life, and then the Releaſe gives the Remainder, and ſo the Land continues charged.</p>

               <p>If the Tenant atturns upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is broke by the Grantee, yet the Reverſion is not deveſted; for the Aſſent cannot be conditional, for he doth not claim the Reverſion from him that atturns, neither can it be made conditionall by the Act of a Stranger to the grant: for if Tenant in tail makes a Leaſe for years, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring a Rent, and dies, and the Iſſue accepts the Rent upon Condition that it ſhall not prejudice his <hi>Entry</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Leaſe, yet he ſhall avoid the Leaſe; for the Aſſent is a thing execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which wil not ſuffer any Condition performable. But if the Condition be precedent to the Aſſent, the Condition is good. But a Releaſe of Right may be upon Condition, as a Releaſe of the <hi>Seignory</hi> to the Tenant upon condition, So of a Releaſe upon condition from one Jointenant to his Companion, for there the thing veſted in his perſon is deveſted, unto which a Condition may be annext. But otherwise of an Aſſent. And if the Patron aſſent to the charge
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42263:43"/>
of the perſon upon Condition, that is good, becauſe the Aſſent is an Intereſt in Law.</p>
               <p>If a Gift in tail be made upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Donee ſhall make a Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is done accordingly, yet the Iſſue ſhall have a <hi>Formedon</hi>; for if the Condition be not performed the Donor could not have entered, and when it is not performed, yet the Eſtate of the Iſſue ſhall not be defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If a Leaſe for life be made with ſuch a Condition, yet the Leſſor may enter for the forfeiture, if the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be made. So if the Leaſe had been made upon Condition that he make a Feoffment, all is one. If an Infant be infeoffed, upon Condition to enfeoffe another, which is done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, yet the Infant may enter, for he hath performed the Condition.</p>
               <p>If two are infeoffed, upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to infeoffe <hi>A.</hi> if one does infeoffe him of the one Moity, and the other of the other Moity, the Condition is performed, for the Intent is fulfilled.</p>
               <p>If a Leaſe for life be made, with a Condition of <hi>Accruer,</hi> if before the day the Leſſor be attainted, yet upon the performance of the Condition the eſtate enlargeth.</p>

the part of his mother, and makes a Feoffment upon Condition, to be performed on his part, or the Heirs, on the part of his Father, and the Father dies, ſo that the Land deſcends to him, the Condition is extinct, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he dies without Iſſue; for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had the Land from his Mother, yet the Condition goes to the Heirs on the part of his Father, being a new thing. As if a Feoffment be made upon Condition of Land in Borough Engliſh, the eldeſt Son ſhall not enter for the Condition broken, as the Heir male muſt do where a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is deſcended upon the Heir Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male. But on the other ſide, if the Son makes a Feoffment to his Mother, of Land deſcended to him from his Father, and after the Mother dies, and the Son dies without Iſſue, the Heir on the part of his Father muſt perform the Condition, and the Heir on the part of his Mother ſhall have the Land in the mean time, and if the Condition had been broke in the life of the Mother it had been all one, and the Heir on the part of the Father ſhould have entred; for the Son is not remitted by the Deſcent. The caſe was; after the entry the Son granted a Rent Charge, and died without Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,

if the Heir on the part of the Father ſhall hold it diſcharged? and ſome think he ſhall.</p>
               <p>If <hi>A.</hi> makes a Leaſe for years upon a collaterall Condition, and the Leſſee makes a Leaſe for 20 years, and then ſurrenders to the Leſſor, it ſeemes to ſome that the Condition for the reſt is extinct; for he hath part of the eſtate by his own Act, ſo that if he ſhould re-enter, he could not be in, in the ſame manner as he was before; for he cannot avoid all the eſtate.</p>
               <p>If a Feoffee upon condition make a Leaſe for life, and after the Feoffor releaſeth the Condition to him in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, the eſtate for life is diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the Condition, and it ſeems to them all one, <hi>viz.</hi> a Releaſe in <hi>Deed,</hi> and in Law. And <hi>Note</hi> if Feoffee upon Condition makes a Leaſe for life, a Releaſe of the Condition to Tenant for life ſhall extend to all the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Feoffee. And it is cleer if there he Feoffee upon Condition of two Acres, and the Feoffor releaſes the Condition in one, it remains in the other, as it ſhall be of a Warranty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to two Acres, for the Condition is ſeveral as the Right is, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in part of the Land, as the Right ſhall do. But if the condition
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42263:45"/>
had been by two, or to two, there a Releaſe by one, or to one, diſchargeth all the Condition, as it ſhall do a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty: but if a man hath two Acres, one to him and his Heirs Males, and the other to him and his Heirs females; and makes a Leaſe for years of both of them, rendring a Rent upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and dies, having a Son and a Daughter; the Condition remains for the Son in one Acre, and is extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for the other. And if Leſſee upon Condition ſurrenders one Acre, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for the other.</p>
               <p>Tenant for life makes a Leaſe for years, upon Condition to have it for the life of Tenant for life, the Leſſee dies, and his Executors perform the Condition, yet the Freehold ſhall not accrue to them. For when the Leſſee for years died, the Condition was gone; for the Executors are not capable to perform the condition to increaſe a Freehold, although they may to encreaſe a term; for the one is teſtamentary, and the other not.</p>

Tenant for life dies within the term, and the Leſſor diſtrains and avowes for the Rent, ſome think he cannot.</p>
               <p>Tenant for life grants a Rent charge in Fee, the Leſſor joins in a Feofment of the Land, the Rent ſhall indure for ever; for it is the Feoffment of the Tenant for life, and the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Leſſor.</p>
               <p>If a Diſſeiſor takes a Confirmation of the Lord to hold by leſſer Services, and the Diſſeiſee releaſes to him, yet he ſhall take advantage of the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>If there be two Tenants in Common for life, and a Confirmation is made to them and their Heirs, they are Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in Common of the Fee, as they were of the Freehold; for a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inures according to the nature of the eſtate upon which it inures, and a Confirmation does not alter the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. If Land be given to two men, and the Heirs of their two bodies, and the Donor confirms the Land to them in Fee, they are not Jointenants of the Fee.</p>
               <p>If a Diſſeiſor grants a Rent Charge to the Diſſeiſee, and he grants it over, and after re-enters, he ſhall hold it diſcharged, for it cannot inure as a Grant, and as a Confirmation.</p>

As if Tenant for life makes a Leaſe for years, and the firſt Leſſor confirms the eſtate of the Leſſee for years, that is void for want of Privity. So if Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail makes a Leaſe for his own life, and the Donor confirms, that will not enlarge his eſtate.</p>
               <p>Lord, Meſne and Tenant, each of them holds by twelve pence, the Meſne is outlawed in Felony, the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Eſtate of the Tenant to hold by one penny, the Heir of the Meſne reverſes the Outlawry by Error, and diſtrains and avows for twelve pence.</p>
               <p>There is Diverſity, <hi>viz.</hi> if the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant dies without Heir, the Law caſt the poſſeſſion of the Tenancy upon the Lord, ſo that he hath the poſſeſſion in Law before Entry. But if the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be attainted of Felony, there the Lord hath not the poſſeſſion either in Fact or in Law before Entry; for if the Tenant continue twenty years in poſſeſſion after the Attainder, he ſhall be ſaid to be Tenant, then here
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42263:46"/>
the Law doth not caſt the poſſeſſion of Meſnalty upon the Lord, and ſo there wants that privity between the Lord and the Tenant which is requiſite to the deminiſhing of the Services. Then here the Confirmation inures to prove his Agreement to the Eſcheat, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, it ſhall be void, which the Law will not ſuffer. If the Meſne grants the Meſnalty to the Lord <hi>Par auter uge,</hi> and after the Lord had confirmed, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> and after <hi>ceſty que vye</hi> dies, there the Meſne ſhall hold according to the <hi>Confirmation</hi>; for the Fee of the Seignory was not in ſuſpence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had it but <hi>par auter vye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a <hi>Fem</hi> hath a Leaſe for twenty years, and the Leſſor confirms to the <hi>Baron</hi> for forty years, who dies, the <hi>Fem</hi> ſhall have the reſidue of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, <hi>Quod nota.</hi>

               <p>If a Diſſeiſor makes a Gift in tail, or Leaſe for life to <hi>A.</hi> to whom the Diſſeiſee confirms, yet after the eſtate determined he ſhall enter upon him in Reverſion; for the eſtate is only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſied, but if the Confirmation had been to the diſſeiſor, he cannot enter upon the particular Tenant.

But it is cleer, if he had confirmed the Eſtate of <hi>A.</hi> he ſhould never enter upon his Heirs; for if a Diſſeiſor gives Land to <hi>C.</hi> in tail, the Remainder to the right Heirs of <hi>C.</hi> and the Donor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the eſtate, that ſhall go to the Fee. And if a Diſſeiſor gives land to <hi>A.</hi> for life, the remainder to B. for life, and the eſtate for life to <hi>A.</hi> is only confirmed, <hi>Quaere.</hi>

               <p>If a Diſſeiſee, where his entry is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and a Stranger enters upon the Heir in by diſcent, confirms the Eſtate of the Stranger, though his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation gives no poſſeſſion of the Freehold, yet his ancient Right is gone for ever. But if the Heir who is in by diſcent were diſſeiſed by <hi>A.</hi> who makes a leaſe for life to B. and the firſt Diſſeiſee confirms his Eſtate, and the Heir enters, the Diſſeiſee hath no remedy during the life of B. for the Confirmation continues ſo long, and no longer.

So if the Heir in by deſcent, had made a Leaſe for life to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſee
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42263:47"/>
and a Stranger, and the Diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee confirms the Eſtate of the Stranger, there the Diſſeiſee hath no Remedy, during his own life, though the Heir re-enters, <hi>Cauſa qua ſupra,</hi> but his Heir ſhall have Remedy; for it was but a concluſion. And ſome ſay that the confirmation in the firſt caſe ſhall not extend to the Right that was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, as a Releaſe will do, no more than if a man hath a Rent Charge, and he and another diſſeiſe the Tenant of the Land, and he which hath the Land confirms the Eſtate of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the Diſſeiſee re-enters, the Rent is revived; for as the Rent was not grantable, being ſuſpended in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, no more may the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation extend to it, or touch it.</p>

               <p>A Diſſeiſor having a Wife makes a Leaſe for life, the Leſſee makes a leaſe to the Wife, for the life of the Wife, the Husband accepts the Deed, and agrees to it, the Diſſeiſee releaſeth to the Wife, the Husband dies, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe is void; for, by the Leaſe to the Wife the Husband had title of Entry for the Forfeiture, and then he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and though he agrees that the Wife ſhall take the Eſtate, yet it is no Eſtopple, then the Husband being remitted there is no poſſeſſion in the Wife upon which the Releaſe may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.

If a Leaſe be made for forty years, the Remainder for ten years, and he in Remainder re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſeth to the Tenant for forty years, he ſhall have it for fifty years; for the forty years cannot be drown'd: If the Remainder had been a leaſe for an hundred years; for one Chattle cannot conſume another, for it is all one as if Leſſee for forty years ſhould make a leaſe for ten years, and after will releaſe to the Leſſee, he ſhall have it for forty, and not for thirty years.

If Tenant for life is diſſeiſed by two, who are diſſeiſed by another, the Leſſor releaſeth to the laſt Diſſeiſor, the firſt Diſſeiſors may enter notwithſtanding the Releaſe; for the Releaſor had no Title of Entry.

As if a Diſſeiſor makes a Leaſe for life, and the Leſſee makes a Feofment, and the Diſſeiſee releaſeth to the Feoffee, the Diſſeiſor cannot Enter.

It was ſaid in the caſe of the <hi>Dum fuit infra aetatem,</hi> if he had Releaſed in tail a greater Eſtate ſhould not have paſſed; for though it doth not appear by the <hi>Dum fuit infra aetatem</hi> what Eſtate he claims (for the Writ is generall) yet when he enters generally into the Warranty, he ſhall not be ſaid to have a Fee againſt the Demandant, but the Demandant ſhall make an Averment, that he did not make the Deviſe but only for life. A Releaſe made to the Patron when the Church is full doth not extinguiſh an Annuity, otherwiſe if it had been in the time of vacation, 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 41. but a Releaſe to the Ordinary peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will not avail; Tenant for life grants a Rent Charge, a Releaſe to him in Reverſion will not extinguiſh it, no more than if he in Reverſion grants a Rent Charge, a Releaſe to Tenant for life will extinguiſh it.</p>

As if a Rent Charge be granted to the Diſſeiſor, &amp;c. and it doth not fortifie the Eſtate of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Leſſee during the firſt Term; for if the firſt Leaſe had bin for twenty years, and the ſecond but for a year, yet by the Releaſe of the firſt Leſſee to the ſecond, all the firſt Eſtate ſhall be extinguished. But if he had been Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life, and the Diſſeiſee Relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to the Diſſeiſor, now during his life the Leſſor cannot enter, otherwiſe if he had been Tenant for years; for in one caſe the Diſſeiſor had a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in him which might be fortified, and in the other caſe but a Chattle.</p>
               <p>Although the Husband cannot give any thing to the Wife immediately, yet if a Diſſeiſoreſſe makes a Leaſe for life, the Remainder to her ſelf in tail, the Remainder to <hi>A.</hi> in Fee, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Diſſeiſee, who releaſeth to

               <p>If an Infant Diſſeiſor makes a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Feoffee dies ſeiſed, and his Heir enters, to whom the Diſſeiſee releaſeth, yet the Infant ſhall have a <hi>Dum fuit infra aetatem,</hi> and ſhall reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for he demauds the poſſeſſion to which he had more Right than the Diſſeiſee, and the Tenant ought to anſwer to the <hi>Demiſe,</hi> and not to the Right: As if the Heir of the Diſſeiſor, who is in by Deſcent, brings an <hi>Aſſize</hi> againſt his Diſſeiſor, it is no plea for him to plead the Releaſe of the Diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee; for he demands the poſſeſſion to which he had more Right than the Diſſeiſee. So if the Diſſeiſor recovers in an Aſſize by erroneous Judgement againſt his Diſſeiſor, and the Diſſeiſee releaſeth to him that hath recovered, and the other brings a Writ of Error, it is no plea for him to plead the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe; for the intent of the Suit was to correct the Error upon the Record. If a Diſſeiſor makes a Leaſe for life, and the Leſſee makes a Feoffment to <hi>A.</hi> who obtains a Releaſe from the Diſſeiſee, the Diſſeiſor brings a <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mili Caſu,</hi> ſome think he ſhall recover; but if the Heir of the Feoffee, who is in by Deſcent, &amp;c. gets a Releaſe, it

is cleer the Diſſeiſor may have an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the Tenant ought to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>Demiſe,</hi> and not to the Right of the Land in both caſes. If a Diſſeiſor enters upon his Feoffee for breach of a Condition, the Feoffee ſhall not have a Writ of Right, though the Right of the Diſſeiſee be releaſed to him before the breach of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. So if the Diſſeiſee enters upon the Heir, who is in by Deſcent, and makes a Feoffment, or releaſeth of ſuch an Heir, and the Heir re-enters, or if one who hath a Title brings a <hi>Formedon in Remainder</hi> againſt an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bator, and recovers by default. See the reſt of the caſe in 9 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 25. In all theſe caſes he to whom the Releaſe was made, or the Right was given, ſhall not have a Writ of <hi>Right,</hi> but it ſhall goe in advantage of him that Removes the poſſeſſion; for being one hath a right in poſſeſſion, and recontinues it, that draws the very right to it, and the Right by it ſelf ſhall not be left in the other. Note that in all theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Right comes after the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but if the Right were before the poſſeſſion, and then the poſſeſſion is removed, the Right remains in the perſon to whom it was given. As if the Heir of the Diſſeiſor, who is in by

deſcent, enfeoffs <hi>A.</hi> and ſeveral other Feoffments are made, and after the Land comes to the Heir again, and the Diſſeiſor enters upon him, and he outs him. Now if the Diſſeiſee brings a Writ of Right upon his firſt poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he ſhall be deluge by vouching of the Feoffees; but he may have a Writ of Right upon the laſt poſſeſſion which he had by Diſſeiſin, and that is beyond all the <hi>Vouchers,</hi> and though the poſſeſſion was removed, yet that is not materiall; for <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith, the effect of the Writ is the meer Right. the Husband diſcontinues in Fee, and takes back an Eſtate to himſelf and his Wife for their lives, the Husband makes a Feoffment and dies, the Wife Releaſeth to the ſecond Feoffee, yet the firſt Feoffee may enter for the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, and ſhe hath no Remedy, and this caſe is ſuppoſed before the ſtatute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8.

the Diſſeiſor, if he aliens over, the releaſe is not pleadable by the Alienee; for he is not privy, and it doth not go with the Eſtate.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42263:125"/>
particular Eſtate, but after the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Eſtate be determined, it is a Rent Service. If a Rent be granted out of two Acres, and if it be behind, that he may diſtrain in one, that is but a Rent ſeck; for it is but one Rent which cannot be wholly a Rent Charge; for the other Acre is not charged, and the Diſtreſs is but a penalty. And if a Rent in Fee be granted, and if it be behind two years, that the Grantee may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, now it is not a Rent ſeck during the two years, but a Rent Charge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrainable after the two years. And if a Rent be granted to one, and if it be behind, his Heirs ſhall diſtrain, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs is void; for there is not any ſuch perſon <hi>in Rerum natura,</hi> and it ſhall never be a Rent Charge becauſe it was not one at the beginning, but if the diſtreſſe had been limitted to a perſon <hi>in Eſſe,</hi> then it ſhould have been a Rent Charge, as 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
               <p>If the Lord grants his Seignory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a Rent, the Seiſin before will not be a ſufficient Seiſin of it. If a Rent be granted to two, and if it be behind, that one may diſtrain, that is a Rent Seck for one Moity, and a Rent Charge for the other Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe one hath another benefit than the other. If a Rent be granted
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42263:126"/>
for life, and by another Deed the Grantor releaſeth all his right in the Rent to the Grantee, and if it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, that he and his Heirs ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, although the Heir ſhall have it by diſtreſſe, as it is adjudged in 8 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 18. yet the Wife ſhall not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed; for it is yet but a Rent ſeck, and the diſtreſs but a penalty, and it is no new Rent which commences after the death. For if a Rent be granted for life, and by another Deed the Grantor grants, if the rent be behind he ſhall diſtrain the remainder in Fee, the remainder is void; for he doth not take ſuch an Eſtate which will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a remainder. If a rent be granted our of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> and if it be behind he ſhall diſtrain in the Mannor of <hi>S.</hi> the Grantee purchaſeth the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>S.</hi> yet the rent remains, and if he doth not purchaſe all the Mannor the diſtreſs ſhall remain in the reſt, and yet the penalty was a thing againſt common right.</p>
               <p>Tenant in tail makes a Leaſe for forty years, reſerving a rent, and after dies, the Heir ſuffers the Leſſee to continue in two or three years, and then outs him, he hath no remedy for the rent arrear after the death of Tenant in tail, no more than the Leſſee hath for
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42263:126"/>
the arrears incured after the breach of a Condition, where he hath entred for the breach of the Condition, and it ſeems he ſhall not have an Action of accompt againſt him as Bailiff of the Land.</p>
               <p>A rent ſeck is granted for life, and after the Grantor confirms his Eſtate, and if it be behind, that he and his Heirs ſhall diſtrain, it is a rent ſeck ſtil for life, and the Grantee hath the rent charge in Fee in remainder; for he hath not two rents. As if the Lord of a Mannor grants the Homage and Fealty of his Tenants, ſaving the rent, it is a rent ſeck, and ſhall be parcell of the Mannor, now if the Tenant will grant to the Lord, that he and his Heirs ſhall diſtrain for that rent, yet the rent is parcel of the Mannor, and the diſtreſſe but a penalty, but if it were a rent charge, it ſhall not be ſaid parcell of the Mannor, becauſe it ſhall commence but now. If the Lord grants the rent of his Tenant to one for life, ſaving the Seignory, and then grants the Seignory and reverſion of the rent to the Grantee, yet it muſt be a rent ſeck during the life of the Grantee, and after a rent ſervice; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the rent, which was a rent ſervice cannot drown the Freehold
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42263:127"/>
of the Rent, which was of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no more can the Reverſion of the Rent Charge drown the Freehold of the Rent Seck in the principal caſe. But in the laſt caſe, if the Grantee had re-granted the Rent Seck to the Grantor, who had the Reverſion, that will operate as a Surrender. <hi>Quaere,</hi> what diverſity where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion comes to the Freehold, or the Freehold to the Reverſion? If a Rent be granted out of two Acres, and if it be behind, that he ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain in one, that is not a Rent Charge in any part; for the diſtreſſe is not limitted out of all the Land. If twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhillings be granted out of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> and if it be behind, that he ſhall diſtrain for that twenty Shillings, and another twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings out of the Mannor of <hi>S.</hi> the firſt twenty ſhillings is but a Rent Seck, and the diſtreſſe a penalty, and the laſt a Rent Charge in the Mannor of <hi>S.</hi> But if one grants a Rent out of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> and if it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, that he ſhall diſtrain in <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> that is a Rent Charge in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>D.</hi> and a penalty in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>S.</hi> If a Rent be granted to one for the life of <hi>A.</hi> and after the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor grants by another Deed, that he
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42263:127"/>
ſhall diſtrain for his life, with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder in Fee, that is a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, if the firſt Rent be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, but if the diſtreſſe be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the life of <hi>A.</hi> or <hi>B.</hi> it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; for it is but a penalty, but in the other caſe the Eſtate is given alſo, though it be a penalty during the time of the appointment of the Determination of the firſt Rent. If twenty Shillings is granted out of <hi>D.</hi> and that the Grantee and his Heirs ſhall diſtrain for that twenty Shillings, and other out of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> For the firſt twenty Shillings it is a Rent Charge in <hi>D.</hi> and a penalty in <hi>S.</hi> and for the other it is a Rent Charge in both. If a Rent be granted out of two Acres, with a diſtreſſe in one, and after the other is recovered by an <hi>Eigne Title,</hi> it ſhall be a Rent Seck, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for it cannot be now a Rent Charge, if it were a Rent Seck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If a Rent reſerved upon a Leaſe for life be granted over, and after a recovery is had in <hi>Waſt,</hi> yet the rent remains, as if the Lord grants the rent, reſerving the Homage, the Rent remaines after the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat.</hi>

A rent is granted in Fee out of Land in Borough Engliſh, and at common Law the Grantee dies, having two Sons, the Eldeſt ſhall have all; for the rent is intire, and ſo not appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionable, then the Eldeſt, being he is Heir at Common Law ſhall have all, as an <hi>Aſſize</hi> at Common Law is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable for a rent granted out of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Demeſue,</hi> and other Lands, 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6.4. <hi>p.

               <p>If Tenant in tail grants a Rent Charge in Fee, and makes a Leaſe for forty years, and dies, and the Iſſue accepts the Rent, the Grantee ſhall have the Rent during the Leaſe and the life of the Iſſue, although the Leſſee Surrenders, <hi>Quaere,</hi> for the

and note that the Eſtate in the Rent ſhall be of the ſame nature of the Eſtate received, and not of the nature of the Eſtate out of which it iſſues.

               <p>The Tenant enfeoffs the Villain of the Lord and a Stranger, upon Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, the matter is how the Lord may obtain the Ward without Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages?

So if an Infant hath a rent, and diſſeiſes the Tenant, and is diſſeiſed by another, who aliens with warranty, that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty ſhall extend to the rent, becauſe in all theſe caſes the Land is diſcharg'd of the rent at the time of the Feofment in Fee; and the action is conceived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Title <hi>Paramount</hi> to the warranty.

A man dies ſeiſed of an Acre in Borough Engliſh in tail, having three Sons, the youngeſt enters, and makes a leaſe to the ſecond for years, who makes a Feofment with warranty, and dies without Iſſue, the yongeſt dies without Iſſue, the eldeſt brings a <hi>Formedon,</hi> if he ſhall be barred by the warranty? It ſeems though the warranty deſcends upon the eldeſt where it was a diſſeiſin to the youngeſt, yet when the right of the Land comes unto him he ſhall ſay that the warranty comences by diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, becauſe he is now privy to the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, and to the eſtate; for if the Father ſeis'd in fee makes a leaſe to the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father for years, who makes a Feofment in Fee with warranty and dies, and the Father dies, that warranty ſhall not be a bar to the ſon, becauſe it comenc'd by diſſeiſin to him whoſe Heir he is.
