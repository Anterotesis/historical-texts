            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vnder the colour of preſenting a certaine requeſt with a confeſsion of their faith to the ſaid King: who though he knew well the verie foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and firſt Authors of that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, yet through his ſingular and natural clemencie folowing the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our heuenlie Father, and hoping by his grace to do more good by waie of pitie, then by rigour of iuſtice, gaue (by plaine Edict made at Amboies in the moneth of March in the yeare 1559) a general Pardon to all ſuche his deceiued and ſeduced ſubiectes in the faith, as would come home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againe, and furthermore by an other Edict made at Romorantin in the moueth of May folowing, he left thoſe which woulde not come home againe, to the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical cenſure only (which reacheth not ſo farre as to bloude) in caſe that they troubled not the common quiet.

of our minorititie, whiche cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Nobility (the chiefeſt next after our moſt deere and moſte welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued brethren) had conceiued, and through partes taking and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which thei with their Adherents, ſtirred againſt our ſaid moſt excellent Ladie and Mother, who alſo to make their part ſtronger tooke vppon them the protection of the ſaid new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which by their ſupport and fauour was greatly augmented.</p>
            <p>For remedy whereof, at our retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from our Annointing and Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, we came to the ſuburbes of S. German in the fieldes nigh to Paris, and we cawſed to be aſſembled in our Parlament the Princes and thoſe of our priuie counſel, with al the courtes of the ſame parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the monethes of Iune and Iulie of the yeare 1561. At what time by their aduiſe at S. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in Laye we made the Edict of the ſaid moneth of Iuly in the ſaied
<pb facs="tcp:11455:5"/>
yeare, by the which Edict, we forebad al other exerciſe of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then ſuch as was according to the receiued cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and maner obſerued in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Churche, from and ſence the time of the Chriſtian faith receiued by the Kinges of Fraunce our Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, and by the Biſhops and Prelates, Perſons and Vicares, and their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This the ſaied protectours of the ſaid new opinion perceiuing, and ſeing that their ambitious enterpriſe was by this Edict vtterly diſappointed, would not ſuffer it to take place: but cauſed through our whole Realme, thoſe of the ſaid new opinion, to riſe vp and to ſtop the execution thereof. And then by reaſon of ſuch troubles, which thei them ſelues had ſtirred, and cauſed to be ſtirred in diuerſe places, thei would make men beleeue, that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to execute the ſaied Edicte, and therefore they called vppon an other aſſemblie of a certaine number of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidentes
<pb facs="tcp:11455:6"/>
and Counſellers of al the high Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rtes of this ſaied Realme, that this might be a matter of greater authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Although yet the ſame aſſemblie was leſſe by two partes of the three, then the other, whiche was made in our ſaied Parlament of Paris, being of the two ordinarie companies. Beſide that in their aſſemblie, were ſuch men as they choſe them ſelues, they being the ſtronger parte of our priuie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, hauing alſo placed therein a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number of the ſaid newe opinion then of the Catholiques, to bring ſo at length their matter about, which they did in deede, obteining a toleraton for the exerciſe of both Religions by our Edict, made onely by way of prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſeuententh of Ianuarie, in the ſaid yeare, 1561. The whiche Edicte our ſaid moſt excellent Ladie and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being then not able to withſtand, was forced againſt her opinion, to let paſſe: ſhee beinge alwaies otherwiſe

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, and the Mareſhal of S.

And that alſo it was to be hoped, that we ſhould be able to redreſſe this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, at what time we ſhould come to our full yeares, authoritie, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer:
<pb facs="tcp:11455:7"/>
al whiche ſhould make our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes more obedient vnto vs. Vpon the which hope our ſaid moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Ladie and Mother moſt gredily atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, diſpoſed her ſelfe to goe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with al diligence poſsible, in the bringing vp of vs, and of our moſt dere and beſt beloued brethren, and of our moſte deere and beſt beloued Siſter, in the true Religion of the Catholique, Apoſtolique, and Romaine Churche: which the moſt Chriſtian Kinges our Predeceſſours, haue kept and maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, almoſt theſe eleuen hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeres: whereof wee and our ſubiectes, are greatly bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and beholden vnto her. And though that by the ſaid Edicte of Ianuarie, thoſe of the newe opinion, had good cauſe to quiet and contente them ſelues, if ſome other ambition and practiſe had not rather pricked them, then the quieting of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, as doe ſufficiently witneſſe vnto vs their behauiours, going ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<pb facs="tcp:11455:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to their preachinges and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, with armes and weapons: yet notwithſtanding they not contenting them ſelues with the ſaied licence and toleratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſtraight after our Edict pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, declared moſt amply and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly to the whole worlde, their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked intention and purpoſe, arming them ſelues vpon their owne priuate Authoritie againſt vs. Taking vp our townes: bringing ſtrangers into our ſaied Realme, and doinge all Actes of hoſtilitie and open enmitie, euen ſo farre, that they gaue vs a Battail vnder the towne of Dreus. In the whiche God gaue vs the victory, hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion of his people ſubiected vnto vs, and that we might once agayne ouercome by Clemency our rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyous Subiectes, and reduce them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our obedience.</p>
            <p>Again hoping that in time, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, by the meanes of our ripe yeares, woulde bringe them alſo
<pb facs="tcp:11455:8"/>
vnder the obedience of his Church, with continuance of the common quyet, we graunted vnto them being yet in our Minority, the Edict of Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication made at Amboyſe, the xix. of March, in the yere. 1562.
