            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It sets forth further, that Sir <hi>H.

It would not have been expected from him to have tasted of the mercy of this Court: For had he had justice done formerly, he had not been to have answered this here. I do beleeve it was expected from those that did govern, to have got him off by mercy, not to take him off by justice; but he ceaseth not to interpose on the behalf of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> and endeavoured to bring him in again, and had like to have withdrawn the faithfull Officers of that Garrison to betray their trust, if money would have done it, that was not wanting to be offered; if preferment would have wrought upon them, that was proffered; if hopes of higher preferment under <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>CHarles <hi>by the Grace of God</hi> (with the old usual Title, <hi>&amp;c.)

               <p>Sir <hi>H.

And also read a Letter from <hi>C.

That he would furnish me with money; And desired that I would not shoot any great Bullets at King <hi>Charls</hi>'s men when they were landing: And further told me, that if I would take a Deputation to command under Major <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi> he would procure it.

                  <hi>This learned Gent.

               <p>This Gent. hath it by Tradition, not by his owne knowledge; but the Case he mentions cannot parallel this: The Act of Parliament saith, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty, or any seventeen; here are three seventeens.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Ellis.</speaker>
               <p>I think the Commission is directed to your Lordships, or any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen: <hi>[Which Commissioners, or any seventeen,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning whereof is, that those seventeen, or more respectively, should hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Quorums</hi> for <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> 17 for <hi>England,</hi> 13 for <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. That Case out of <hi>Plowden,</hi> differs clearly from this: For, if a Commission be directed, and there be no <hi>Quorum,</hi> then the Commissioners must all certifie. We humbly conceive that if your Lordships be here seventeen, or more, you are fully authorized to proceed.</p>

               <p>In many Cases you have a <hi>Quorum</hi> of persons, such and such men: It's true, here is no <hi>Quorum</hi> of persons, but a <hi>Quorum</hi> of the number; and if there be a <hi>Quorum</hi> of seventeen it is warrantable.</p>

That which you speak of in relation to my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi>'s Case is true; if a Commission be directed to Commissioners, and no <hi>Quorum</hi> appointed, then all must certifie: But by the Act of Parliament, and the Commission made in pursuance of it, the <hi>Quorum</hi> is seventeen: But here are three <hi>Quorums.</hi>

                  <hi>My Lord, I said before that I am no Lawyer, I understand nothing of it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desire to be Judge in my own cause; but I do not desire likewise to be judged by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very person that would sit to judge me, neither would I give up that right that belongs to an English man to every one that demands it, therefore I desire you to grant this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, that you will make appear that you are a lawful Judicature. I would rather die ten thousand times then I will be guilty of giving up my fellow-freemens liberties and priviledges.</hi>

So that, my Lord, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of Answer, if Mr. Doctor will not plead to this, my Lord I must thereupon pray that you will proceed according to the Act, as in cases of High Treason, which is very pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>I doubt the Gent. is in jest, we are here to attend by command of his Highness the L. Protector; these Gent. are all sworn by Act of Parliament: it is a little slighting of the Court, to appeal from the Court to the Counsel; but (my Lord) I beseech you he may forbear to say he is overborn. You shall have Justice done if you will plead, if not there was a President but now; if you please to put your self upon the Trial, you shall have a fair Trial.</p>

If a Jury was to do it, you were not to proceed to Conviction; This Gent. sayes there is no President for it, but we say it was the same in Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> time; they proceeded to Conviction and final sentence, when they proceeded against Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> did not the Parliament approve of what they did in that case as just, honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lawful? did not Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> did they not all petition to the House? did not the Parliament order Execution upon some, and cleared others? To say this is without president, when presidents are so frequent, I wonder that should be said. To that point of a Jury, I must tell this Gent. he speaks of a Jury, but hath not put himself upon a Trial; after he hath pleaded not guilty, then it must be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the manner of the proceeding; but to come before he plead guilty or not guilty to desire a Jury, this is a little to anticipate your judgment.</p>

                  <hi>viz.</hi> That he the said <hi>John Mordant</hi> intending to embroile this Nation in new and intestine Wars the 30 of <hi>April</hi> last past, and at divers times since the 10 <hi>Octob.</hi> 26 together with <hi>Henry Bishop, Hartgil Baron,</hi> &amp;c. at the Parish of <hi>Clem.

Secondly, That he did traiterously, advisedly, and maliciously declare, publish and promote <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> to be King of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Thirdly, That he did traiterously, advisedly and maliciously hold intelligence and Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with C. <hi>Stuart,</hi> and that he did declare these Treasons by overt act, that is to say, by conferring with <hi>John Stapley,</hi> and <hi>Henry Mallory</hi> how to effect the same, and did deliver several Commissions from C. <hi>Stuart</hi> to several persons, and this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Statute. To this charge of High Treason the Prisoner pleads not guilty; we are ready (my Lord) to call our witnesses to prove him guilty of these several Crimes; and with the leave of the Court, we shall call our witnesses,</p>

               <p>We were about a quarter of a yeare agoe at the halfe moon Tavern in <hi>Aldersgatestreet,</hi> at that time there was no discourse about the business at all. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he was speaking to me about the Times, losses of priviledges, great taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c. wherein I agreed with him, and wished they might be better. I asked him if there was any way to help it; he said yea, and said that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> was intending for <hi>England,</hi> and that would be a fair opportunity to redresse all grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. At <hi>Birkshire</hi> house there he was pleased to enquire concerning the affairs of <hi>Sussex,</hi> and in what preparation they were, in case the King of <hi>Scots</hi> should land; I told him I did not know, I had not been in the Countrey lately, I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there would not be an apearance suitable to his expectation: he told me something concerning <hi>Surry,</hi> that there was a considerable strength there ready to assist us in <hi>Sussex,</hi> and joyn with us when any such thing should happen; he did say that he had delivered out four Commissions, three for horse, and one for foot, but to whom I know not, I dare not sweare it, but it is to the best of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</p>

my selfe, and Mr. <hi>Mordant,</hi> were to meet further to debate of things; I understood it was for the businesse of the King, but it was not positively so expressed; he asked me how things went on in <hi>Sussex;</hi> I told him I could not satisfie him: Therefore we told him there should some of our Countrey meet him at <hi>Crawly</hi> to give him an account; he said there was a considerable force, but I never heard him speak of any number of Horse or Foot in <hi>Surry.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, Captain <hi>Mallory</hi> was in custody, and a guard constantly set upon him, which guard was relieved every twenty four hours; the manner of his escape I only had by relation, we have used all endeavours to have found him since he is escaped, we did that night send presently to <hi>Southwark</hi> to Inns there, and laid wait for him, and sent to Captain <hi>Mallory's</hi> Brother-in-Law, where he formerly lay, examined him, but all in vain; where we had any intimation of any relation of his, we did send to search for him.</p>

               <p>My Lord, Cap. <hi>Mallory</hi> gave in information upon oath before my Lord <hi>Gosse</hi> and my selfe upon the twenty first of <hi>Aprill</hi> last, and upon his oath did inform us, that about the beginning of <hi>March</hi> last Cap. <hi>An. Staply</hi> and himselfe being at the <hi>Halfe moon Tavern, Joh. Mordant</hi> Esq. being upon the Exchange was sent for to Mr <hi>Staply,</hi> and that he came; Thereupon Mr. <hi>Staply</hi> presented Cap. <hi>Mallory</hi> to Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> as a Gentleman that was interested in <hi>Charles Stuarts</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, together with Mr. <hi>Staply</hi> that was his Brother; he said that by that Brother he meant <hi>Joh.

Thereupon he informed us that Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Cap. <hi>Mallory</hi> in what readinesse the Horse that were to be raised in <hi>Sussex</hi> were: Mr. <hi>Mallory</hi> informed us that to that he returned an answer, that they were not in so good a posture as he did believe Mr. <hi>Joh. Staply</hi> had represented to Mr. <hi>Mordant,</hi> but doubted that it would fall much short: <hi>Mallory</hi> told us that at that answer Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> did much wonder, because he said <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> the King was in a very good posture, and that there was a daily expectation of his coming over with forces, and that thereupon Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> did desire that there might be a meeting in some convenient place beeween him and Mr. <hi>Staply,</hi> and such others of that County of <hi>Sussex</hi> as should be thought fit. My Lord, it was (he said) to this end that there they might conferr together, and understand how the affairs stood in reference to the Counties of <hi>Sussex</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> that they might the better assist each other in the intended insurrection; he did inform us (my Lord) that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it was agreed there should be a meeting upon the <hi>Tuesday</hi> following at <hi>Crawly,</hi> and in order thereunto he said that Mr. <hi>An. Staply</hi> and himselfe did speak with Mr. <hi>Joh. Staply</hi> to have a meeting accordingly at <hi>Crawly</hi> upon the <hi>Tuesday</hi> following, and they did agree to it: he said that they should meet with Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> at <hi>Crawly,</hi> but in the mean time Mr. <hi>Joh. Staply</hi> being sent for to <hi>Whitehall</hi> that meeting was prevented. My Lord, this is all.</p>

               <p>The Attorney Geueral hath exhibited a charge of High Treason against the prisoner at the Barr, that was, to raise force against the Government, and publish <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> to be King, and held correspondence with him.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Mord.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <q>My Lord, you have heard the witnesses, the first Gentleman Mr. <hi>Joh. Staply,</hi> he was pleased to urge against me, that I said <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> writ to me to engage my friends, but said not that he saw the letter, or that any one was by: he did not name the time or place but at randome, but that I said so; being asked about Commissions, he denyes that I told him I either had Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or delivered any; he says I gave him encouragement to this engagement, or what he cals it I know not, but, he doth not say what kind of encouragement it was: he doth not say I promised him money, or preferment; he says he heard I engaged two other Gentlemen, Sir <hi>Francis Vincent</hi> and Col. <hi>Brown;</hi> he was asked, if any was by at these discourses, he said none was by: My Lord this is a single evidence; he says it was a year or more since, he says I said I was intrusted by <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> about the latter end of the last winter. For Mr. <hi>An. Staply,</hi> he urges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, that at his lodging I discoursed with him, that the way to helpe us was to bring in <hi>Charles Stuart;</hi> he says that I said in <hi>Surry</hi> was a considerable strength to joyn with <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> which if true might prove troublesome
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105361:13"/>
to me, but I have not been in <hi>Surry</hi> this year and a halfe: he says, only to the best of his remembrance, I said I had three or four Commissions, but he says it is to the best of his remembrance, but doth not say he saw the Commissions, and will not swear whether they were for Horse or Foot: he says at the <hi>Half-moon</hi> I spake with him and <hi>Mallory;</hi> who that is I have already spoke to: he says I did not name the number of any forces that were ready: he says that we agreed to meet on the <hi>Tuesday</hi> following at <hi>Crawly</hi> with Mr. <hi>Mallory,</hi> but says that I was not there. My Lord, I doe not know that place, He says it is in our Country, but it is not: he says it was his Brother <hi>Joh. Staply</hi> that was to meet me: he says it was not about any positive thing why I was to meet there, but in generall, to carry on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the intended design: he says not that I said it, but that I said I heard that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> would land with a considerable party: he says it was to debate things in generall, he said it was not said about <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> that he was not mentioned, but he supposed it to be so: he says positively that I never spake of any number of Horse or Foot, or any thing of that kind, I asked him when I first spoke of this; he returned no time, would not say any positive time, but said all was since the breaking up of the Parliament: I asked him who was by, he said no body, all was private: he says the time when we were at the <hi>Halfe moon</hi> was near the time that those that served the late King were banished; he says positively I did not meet at the place appointed, and he gives the reason, a very insufficient one, because his Brother was sent for up; that could not hinder me: he waves his own meeting: he says all was private; I submit it all to this honourable Court.</q>

               <p>The Charge is for levying of War to alter the Government, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyle us again in a new War; to which he pleads not guilty: for the proof of this we have offered to you witnesses; I shall take them in order as the Gentleman did at the Barr. <hi>John Staply</hi> said Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> said the King writ to him to encourage and engage his friends to assist him at his coming; but says not the time when this was done: he says he did not see the letter, but says Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> told him he had a letter, all the discourses (because he says there was no time) it agrees that they were since the tenth of <hi>October</hi> 1656, and so it is clear within this Act, and within your jurisdiction. Now see how it was carried on; after he had told him this, how doth he encourage him in his telling him the justice of the cause; the persons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged therein, and of Sir <hi>William Waller.</hi> Then (My Lord) he told them if the Forces of <hi>Sussex</hi> were not sufficient, that the <hi>Surry</hi> forces would come to assist them for the coming in of <hi>Charles Stuar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ny Staply.</hi> So that we conceive under favour that <hi>Joh. Staply</hi> and <hi>An. Staply</hi> doe agree in most of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. <hi>An. Staply</hi> says that Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> came to him, tels him there were great grievances; I, says he, but how shall it be remedied? tels him that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> intended to come to <hi>England</hi> with a great force, which would redresse them: he asked him how the businesse was in <hi>Sussex;</hi> he said it was not in so good a posture as he expected: he said that <hi>Surry</hi> forces should joyn with <hi>Sussex.</hi> My Lord, I leave it nakedly to you, if you find this to be true, we submit it to you, and Mr <hi>At. G.</hi> will pray what his place requires.</p>

               <p>Sir, Was it not a great aggravation of the sins of the Egyptians, that when God had declared himself by so many signs and wonders on the behalf of the Israelites, that yet notwithstanding they would still pursue <hi>Moses</hi> and Israel? was not this a great aggravation of their sin?</p>
               <p>Who is so great a stranger in this Nation as to be ignorant what God hath done amongst us, by a series of wonderful Providences so many years together against that very party who are still hatching of Treasons and Rebellions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us? It grieves my very soul to think of it, that after so many signal

Providences, wherein God seems to declare himself (as it were by signs and wonders) that your heart should be still hardened, I may say, more hardned then the very hearts of the Egyptians, for they at length did not only see, but but confessed that the Lord sought against them; but you, O that you would confess, and give glory to God.

               <p>I have done, only I would say one word to you, because I hear you are a Protestant, I would only ask you this question, what think you, would have become of the Protestant Interest, of the Protestants of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> If you had had your will, if <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> had come in; if you had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>And now Sir, but one word more to you as you are an English-man: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you consider what would have become of this Nation, if you had had your will; you had brought a new Civil war upon <hi>England</hi> at the least. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think of a New Civil war upon <hi>England,</hi> but I think of desolation upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation to this poor Nation, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I have but one word to say to Dr. <hi>Hewet:</hi> And Sir, when I look upon you as a Minister, I must confess I do not know how to speak to you, because it has always been my way to speak to men of your Profession, to Ministers, I never spake to them but as a Childe speaks to his Father: Such reverence and such regard I bear to their Office. But to speak so to a Minister, as a Judge speaks to a Traytor, I must confess I know not how to do it. But Sir, there must be words spoken to you, though I do not speak them, and not onely to you as a Ttaytor, but a Traytor in the highest degree; not as a Traytor (as you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, for endeavoring to levy a new War, and to bring desolation and a War in this Nation) but such an one as should rather die a Traytor then own the Authority of the Nation. But Sir, I know not how to speak to you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ecord must speak to you; and I my self will not any further.</p>
               <p>I have now a word to speak to you Mr. <hi>Mordant,</hi> God hath appeared in Justice, and God doth appear in Mercy; as the Lord is just to them, so he is exceeding merciful to you; and I may say to you, That God appears to you at this time, as he speaks to sinners in Jesus Christ; for Sir, he doth clear sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Christ Jesus, even when they are guilty, and so God cleareth you: I will not say you are guilty, but ask your own Conscience whether you are or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>And now let me add this word to those two Gentlemen. Sirs, when I have done speaking, I shall never have done praying for you, as long as you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; that is the last thing I must say to you: And now let the Judgment of the Court be read.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Thereupon the Clerk read the Judgment and Sentence of the Court against Sir <hi>H. Slinsby</hi> Kr. which was as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THat the said Sir</hi> Henry Slingsby <hi>as a false Traytor to his said Highness the Lord Protector, and this Commonwealth, shall be conveyed back again to the Tower of</hi> London, <hi>and fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:105361:15"/>
In the next place, the same Judgment and Sentence of the Court was read against Dr. <hi>Hewet</hi> being ingrost in like manner.</p>
            <p>This being done, the Judgment of the Court was declared concerning Mr. <hi>Mordant,</hi> whis (in short) was, That upon consideration of the whole matter; in reference to the Charge against him, and his Plea thereunto, They did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge him, <hi>Not guilty.</hi> And so the Prisoners were dismist.</p>
            <p>Proclamation being made, the Court adjourned back to the Painted Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where they ordered the execution of the Sentence upon Sir <hi>Henry Slings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hewet,</hi> to be on Saturday next. And Warrants are issued out to the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> to see execution done accordingly.</p>
            <p>Then the Court adjourned it self till Thursday the Tenth instant.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the former Sentence passed by the High Court, yet his Highness being informed, that Dr. <hi>Hewet,</hi> prisoner in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> who stand attainted of High Treason, before the Commissioners appointed by Act of Parliament, for levying War against his Highness and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, had Judgment to be hanged, drawn and quartered at <hi>Tibourn</hi> this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Saturday, His Highness was graciously pleased, upon humble suit made, to reprieve him till Tuesday the eighth insiant, at which time he is to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on Tower-hil, by severing his Head from his Body; and His Highness plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is, that the Judgment shall be remitted.</p>
            <p>The like favor also was extended to Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby,</hi> who is to suffer the same day, in the same place.</p>

noble Gentleman Mr. Sheriff <hi>Robinson,</hi> telling him that what he had to say he would speak to him; which was to this purpose:</p>

               <hi>That he had received a Sentence to die, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his endevouring to betray the Garrison of</hi> Hull: <hi>But said, All that he did in that business he was drawn into by others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Officers of that Garrison did believe he had some greater Designe in hand, and therefore they would needs pump him to the bottome: But what he spoke to them in private was brought into evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: He likewise said, That he did no more than any person would have done that was so brought on.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>That he had made many applications (by his Friends) for a Reprieve, but found his Highness was inexorable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He did confess that he did deliver a Commission (as it was charged against him:) But said, that it was an old Commission, and what he meant was well known to himself; but what construction others had made of it might appear by his present condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He discovered little sense of forrow, or fear of Death; but said, <hi>He was ready to submit,</hi> or words to like purpose.</p>
            <p>Then he addressed himself to private prayer again; and kneeling down to the Block he prayed privately for a short space: Then laid his head upon the Block, and at the signe given, the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner severed his Head from his Body at one Blow: And his Friends put his Body into a Coffin, and removed it into a close Coach prepared neer the place.</p>

            <p>After which prayer he addressed himself to the people in a speech which continued above the space of an hour; the substance of which speech was as followeth.</p>
            <p>That he was become a publick Spectacle to Men and Angels, and that he hoped the Omniscient God was then beholding him with much pity and compassion, the rather because he came hither to bear witness to <hi>the truth,</hi> for which end he came into the world, both as a common Christian and as a Minister, for wich dignity he blessed the name of God.</p>
            <p>That it seemed strange to him that he pleading for the lawes and customes of the Land, should dye by those that should also stand for them.</p>
            <p>That he had rather dye many Deaths then betray his fellow Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the inconveniences of a subjection to their wills that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him to Death.</p>
            <p>That although he had no knowledge of the Lawes, yet he had instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the learned in that faculty, and had accordingly urged se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Cases, and that he had made his appeal to the learned in the Law, to the Judges, and to his Highnesse own Councell.</p>
            <p>That through his ignorance in the customes and formalities of Courts, he was taken in 3. defaults, but that when he would have pleaded, and resolved so to do, he was taken from the Barr.</p>
            <p>That he did the next day petition the Court twice, subscribing his name thereunto, to be admitted to plead; but the Title of the Court being mis-taken in the one, and a word left out in the other, it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for an Affront or Contempt to the Court, and that his answer was his sentence.</p>
            <p>He prayed God to forgive those that adjudged him to dye, taking advantage of his ignorance.</p>
            <p>That at the beginning of his Tryall there was a seeming consent that nothing should be taken to his prejudice through his ignorance in the nicety of the Law; but heartily prayed God to forgive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>He remembred that his Highnesse told him he was like a flaming Torch in the midst of a sheaf of Corn: but said it was very uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly done of them that so irritated his Highnesse against him; but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the God of mercy to pardon and forgive them all.</p>
            <p>Thus (but more largely) having spoken to the people, he told them he would after the manner of our Saviour, (who when he was to be taken from his Disciples, blessed them) pray for them, which he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly for a good space with much earne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
