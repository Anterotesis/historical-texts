            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Schollers bookes, the trauaile of the soule, the weakning of the bodie, the care of the day, and studie of the night, were not not so welcome to the most, as a Lawyers fee from the client, or a tenants new-yeares gift to his Land-lord. I your Maiesties poore subiect could speake herein by experience, what small hartening I haue had in the world for my poore trauels in the Church: but I will be sparing in mine owne cause. And yet I speake not this as though we expected our reward from men (though we be men, and had need of terrene encouragement:) but I am bold, a poore writer of this Church of England, to poure forth the common griefe and complaint of students in this behalfe, into your princely bosome. Bookes were growne into such small request, that many would scarce vouchsafe the reading of them; but few beare in mind who presented them: they were layed aside by the walles, or set vp onely to make a shew, as one saith:<note place="margin">Senec. lib. 1. de tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vitae.</note>

And in this confidence I haue bene bold againe to offer my seruice to your Maiestie. For as he that made that harpe wherewith <hi>Thales</hi> appeased the tumult of the Lacedaemonians; and he that built the ship wherewith <hi>Themistocles</hi> did defend Greece, had cause more to reioice therein, then in any worke beside: so to none else we more willingly present our labours, then to your sacred Maiestie, a generall procurer of our peace, and defender of Church and countrey; whose vigilant heart careth for all, whose diligent eye seeth for all, whose liberal hand reacheth vnto all. And not onely at this present, but while I liue, haue I purposed to consecrate my pen to the honor of your Maiestie (if God will &amp; you please:) And I say with <hi>Hierome:</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Ans. 1. Our historians make mention, that <hi>ann.

S. <hi>Paul</hi> may as well fall vnder your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, for excommunicating <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Hymenaeus,</hi> which had made shipwracke of the faith, 1.

               <p>Now, whereas we are referred to our Chronicles <hi>anno</hi> 1554. which was the 2. of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> if his meaning be to impute all errors and heresies, that spring vp, to the Church, where they begin, this instance toucheth the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Church then flourishing, it tendeth not to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants disgrace.

               <p>But the Papists are the men rather, which are blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and spotted with these heretical opinions:<note place="margin">Papists come neerer Arria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Nestorians, Eutychians, &amp;c. then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</note> with the Arrians they hold Christ not to be God of himselfe: with the Nestorians they in effect make two Christs, one offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the sacrifice of the Masse, another to whom they offer in heauen: with the <hi>Eutychians</hi> they take away the truenes of Christs bodie, making it to bee in a thousand places at once: with the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> they extenuate his humanitie, denying that he opened his mothers wombe: they affirme that the commandements may be kept, and so in effect are Catharists; for where the law is not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed, there is no sinne: they make a Sacrament of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, as a supplement <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Ans. First, these dissensions giuen in instance, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene those which are called Lutheranes and vs, who wherein they differ and dissent from vs, come neerer to the Papists, then Protestants, as in the opinions of the corporall presence in the Eucharist, of the vbiquitie or omnipresence of Christes bodie, of free will, vniuersall grace, hypotheticall election, faith of infants, and such like: but among the Protestants that purely professe the Gospell of Christ, and especially in <hi>England,</hi> there is no difference or dissent in any of these points, or those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obiected, or in any other substantiall point of faith.

               <p>Secondly, neither needeth the aduersarie to obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Protestants this diuision betweene them and the Lutheranes, seeing there is as great a rent in the Papall Church: for the whole Church of <hi>France</hi> dissenteth from the common opinion of the Romanists, in very princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall points: they to this day do not acknowledge the Pope to be aboue generall Councels: and for this cause they do not submit themselues to the decrees of the late Tridenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, though the intemperate heate of some Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran writers can not be excused against the Ministers of the reformed Churches, as fayling both in the cause which they handle, and in the manner of handling (for among our selues such bitter inuectiues are not vsed) yet of all other the rayling of popish sectaries one against another most exceedeth, as may plentifullie appeare in the late writings and bookes of the Popish Priests and Iesuites set forth against themselues.</p>

               <p>FOr the strengthening of this accusation, three proofes are produced. First, the multiplicitie of suites. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

the multitude of statutes. Thirdly, the testimonie of Protestant writers that complaine of the impietie of these times, pag. 8.9.</p>

               <p>Ans. 1. Although the multiplying of suites, and aptnes to goe to law, and that for trifles, be not commendable, yet it is no sufficient argument, to disable and make a nullitie of a Church: for euen the Corinthians, to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> doubteth not to ascribe the name of the <hi>Church of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.2.</note> were contentious, and full of quarrels: as the Apostle saith vnto them: <hi>Now therefore there is vtterly a fault a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, because ye goe to law one with another, why rather suffer you not wrong, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Cor. 6.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If suites haue encreased, since the expulsion of the Popes iurisdiction out of England,<note place="margin">Religion not the cause of multiplicitie of suites amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Protestants.</note> religion is not the cause thereof, but other probable reasons may bee yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, without any blame to the Church or Religion: first, because since the dissolution of Abbeys, and the disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of those lands into many mens hands, which before were vnited and annexed to those Corporations, it could not otherwise be chosen, but that questions about titles, and priuiledges should grow: as infinite were the suites, which were commenced before, betweene Abbots and Bishops, the Priors and their Couents, betweene one Cell and another: which controuersies haue had their time, and now begin to slake, as Westminster Hall can testifie, and in the next succeeding age, are like to be fewer, and we wish they may so be. As for Lawyers wealth, it is no disparagement to the Gospell, though it may be a blot to their conscience, if it bee not rightfully gotten: neither are there many that haue of late daies gained so much by the law (though some I confesse, by the confluence of Clients, and if I may so say, the <hi>monopolie</hi> of causes, haue gotten enough) for it is thought, that scarse the tenth man, of the whole number, that are called to the Barre, do
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20708:27"/>
get their maintenance by it. And it is well knowne, that some of your friends and welwillers (Frier <hi>Robert</hi> or <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> or what els the first letter of your name <hi>R.</hi> betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth) haue helped to share and shaue in the law among the rest.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas many appeales were made to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and infinite causes promoted thither, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops fetcht vp their Chapters, Priors their Couents by processe to <hi>Rome,</hi> Archbishops their Suffraganes, yea sometime the subiects their King: Is there not great cause since this forraine course, in prosecuting of suites was stopped, that much more busines thereby be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at home? so that the floods of causes which streamed into that sea, being turned an other way, must needes make an inundation and ouerflowing of suites at home.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Gospell hath not caused such multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of suites; but it is an abuse of this long peace which hath increased the wealth of the land: and riches breede quarrels, and make men impatient of wrongs. I make no doubt, but that in our neighbour kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> suites haue beene multiplied, and Lawyers thereby farre more aduantaged, since the appeasing of the ciuill warres then in many yeares before, which change can not be layed vpon their religion, which is not there changed, but vpon the alteration of the times. This then is not an effect of the Gospell, but a defect in those that know not to make vse of this peace and abundance procured by the Gospell.</p>

And concerning his Catholike Prince (whom <hi>Parsons</hi> stil mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be the Catholike King of Spaine, or some to bee brought in by him) I will answere him with their owne Priests words,<note place="margin">Replie fol. 74. a. lin. 3.</note>

            <p>And that it may yet further appeare, what a vaine hope is hatched in their breasts, first during her Maiesties daies, they had small reason to looke for reiuing of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

whose constant resolution, and setled iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst al mixture or toleration of contrarie religion, we al were perswaded of while she liued they needed not to doubt, her Maiestie her selfe had professed in the late Proclamation not long before her peaceable departure, to the comfort of all her subiects.</p>
            <p>And the Iesuite himselfe further confesseth, that there is no hope that the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> (now our Soueraigne Lord King of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Manifest. fol. 49. a.</note> and <hi>Ireland) will be a Catholike,</hi> which the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> beleeued before, and now to their great comfort seeth, and with thankes to Iesus Christ acknowledgeth.

            </p>
            <p>Thus the Masse-priests were bold to write not long since, but simplie and suspiciouslie, as though <hi>England</hi> would afford any competitor to stand vp against the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full title of his Maiestie, who onely by his royall descent had enterest to succeede in the Crowne, which God be thanked we see to all our comforts, without any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or opposition to be peaceablie deriued vnto his Maiestie, which long may he possesse with honor to Gods glorie.</p>
            <p>We trust then that God, which in his mercie hath san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified this land to professe his Gospell, will consecrate it as his Temple, to be the piller of truth, and candlesticke to hold out the light of his word to the worlds end: and that he wil put into the heart of our gratious Soueraigne, and honorable Counsellers so to prouide, that true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may be transmitted vnto posteritie, and so blesse the Kings royall posteritie, and especiallie his Maiesties dearest sonne and heire apparant Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may be so planted in his princely youth, that it may grow vp and increase with him.

                  <p>First, where the foundation is false, the building must
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20708:36"/>
needes be deceitfull: this durtie dawber worketh with vntempered morter, and patcheth vp his matter with false grounds: 1. For neither doe the Protestants denie that <hi>Peter</hi> was at Rome, but that he neither came thither so soone (the 2. yeere of <hi>Claudius</hi>) nor continued there so long (namely 25. yeeres) as the Popish Church holdeth:<note place="margin">Vntruth 11.</note> He should haue named such Protestants, whom he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with this deniall of <hi>Peters</hi> being at Rome.<note place="margin">Vntruth 12.</note> 2. These doubts and obiections moued by Protestants, arise not onely now chiefly by reason of some difference in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian writers, but are grounded vpon certaine places of Scripture, which they shall haue much adoe to answere, as is elsewhere declared.<note place="margin">Synops. p. 141.</note> 3. The bookes of <hi>Tobie</hi> and the <hi>Macchabees</hi> are not refused onely for that cause,<note place="margin">Vntruth 13.</note> for that they cannot be assigned to any certaine time, but for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reasons, both for the matter, which is fabulous and erronious, in many points; and the manner, diuers spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and places being repugnant and contradictorie.<note place="margin">Synops. p. 12.15.</note> So then he hath rapped foorth three vntruths together: such a plentifull forge this Frier hath, to coyne his Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall stuffe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, be it knowne vnto him, that the Protestants faith relieth vpon a more sure ground, then either Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in Artes, or in storie <hi>Brutes</hi> being in England, or <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> comming to Rome: the first is <hi>phantasticall,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>coniecturall,</hi> the third <hi>historicall:</hi> the first but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention; the second a tradition; the third a collection or collation of times.

                  <p>FIrst, this argument is denied: for though among the Infidels and misbeleeuers, such as the Turkes are, and the Iewes were at the comming of Christ, where none hold the truth, but al are in error, diuisions and sects make them worse: yet is it not so among those, which professe the trueth: 1. For there the diuersitie of sects, and the springing and publishing of heresies, doth make the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the truth more glorious, and the defenders ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more faithfull and constant: as the Apostle saith: <hi>There must be heresies euen among you, that they which are approoued among you, may be knowne.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19.</note> 2. And yet in the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20708:44"/>
meane time, the authors of schisme, and hatchers of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, are thereby giuen ouer to greater vngodlines: as the Apostle againe saith: <hi>But the euill men and deceiuers, shall waxe worse and worse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13.</note> 
                     <hi>deceiuing and being deceiued.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. For if the Church of God, were then at the worst, when heresies and schismes are raised: then should the state of the Primitiue Church bee condemned, when so many wicked doctrines of Ebionites, Basilidians, Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians, Marcionites, Arrians, Sabellians with the rest were stirred vp by the diuell.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The reason of this difference is euident: because that where the truth is professed, the opposition of errors doth giue occasion, that the same be more throughly sif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as the wheate is by winnowing made more pure, and the light shineth brighter in darknes. But where there is no truth or sound knowledge at all,<note place="margin">The Church of God may profit by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, though others waxe worse and worse.</note> there diuisions doe but harden them the more in their error, like as chaffe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing winnowed is scattered and dispersed: and as they which walke in darknes without light, the further they goe, the more they wander. This is the very case of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing Turkes, and of the misbeleeuing Iewes, Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, Sadduces, Herodians, they were all out of the way. This point is well touched by <hi>Augustine: Non ad diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum pertinet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Homil. de pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storibus.</hi>

                     <hi>quis isto, vel illo modo erret, omnes errantes vult quibuslibet erroribus:</hi> It is nothing to the diuell, whether a man erre this way, or that way, all that bee in error are his, what error soeuer they hold. No marueile then, if both Iewes and Gentiles by their diuisions waxed worse and worse, because they still were vnder the kingdome of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, howsoeuer diuided.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if this argument be admitted, it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude strongly against the Papists, whose diuisions are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously knowne both to haue been, and at this present to be such betweene the Secular Priests, and irregular Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natians, both at Rome, in France, and in England (which were happy, if it were rid of them both) and so hotly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued on both sides with all reprochfull termes, of knaues, heretikes, diabolicall Machiauels, diuels incarnate, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20708:44"/>
such like, as they are not able to shew euer to haue been among Protestants. And these diuisions not onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in verball differences,<note place="margin">In the solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> or repugnance in externall rites and liberties, but in materiall points of doctrine, as hath been before shewed. Therefore among Papists, where neither sect holdeth the truth, this argument may well hold by this their erronious dissentions and diuersities, to conuince them of monstrous and grosse iniquities.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, against English Protestants (whom this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller chiefly impugneth) this engine of his hath no force: for (to Gods glorie be it spoken) fewer diuisions haue not been seene in the Church of England (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting some few nouelties of certaine new fangled teachers, who in time, I doubt not, but will waxe wiser) then at this present. And I trust our domesticall heates shal euery day abate and slake, and our contentions at home decrease, that wee may with one ioynt force oppose our selues to the common aduersarie: like as <hi>Abraham</hi> rescued <hi>Lot</hi> from the Gentiles, though some priuate iarres betweene their families had broken out before. The Grecians are said, that when their enemies approched, though they had been at ciuill discord before, would compound their quarrels, to resist their forraine foes: And it is written of <hi>Themistocles</hi> and <hi>Aristides,</hi> two famous Captaines of the Athenians, that when they went on embassage together,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. I will further shew the vanitie of the forged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised miracles by these reasons following.</p>
                  <p>First, it is euident by the testimonie of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that miracles were not vsuall in their time. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> saith:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In</hi> 1. <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Quare nunc non ita fit, vt habeant homines gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Dei, qua operentur miracula?</hi> Why haue not men now adaies grace giuen them to worke miracles? <hi>Augustine</hi>

saith: <hi>Modò iam caeci non aperit oculos miraculo Domini,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The power of miracles not vsuall in the Church now.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the blind receiueth not his bodily sight by the miracle of our Lord, but the blind heart receiueth sight by the oracle, or word of the Lord: now the dead bodie riseth not, but the soule riseth, that was dead in the liuing bodie: now the deafe eares are not opened, &amp;c. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith: <hi>Licet nostra non habeamus miracula, &amp;c.</hi>

                     </note> Although we haue no miracles of our owne, yet the miracles of our patrone are a consolation to vs. Seeing then these Fathers thought that they had no power to worke miracles, what impudencie is it against their owne iudgement to ascribe miracles vnto them? As an Epistle goeth vnder <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi> name, wherein he is fained to report, that as he was about to write a letter to <hi>Hierome,</hi> his soule being lately departed, appeared vnto him, and talked with him.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epist.</hi> 205. Miracles false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fathered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Epist.</hi> 106.</note> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise how <hi>Hierome</hi> after his death, caused the soules of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers to returne to their bodies, and so they reuiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: how hee deliuered one condemned to hell: and how sixteene blind persons were restored to sight, in the translation of his bodie.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Bernard</hi> it is auouched, that after his death he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led eleuen blind, tenne maimed,<note place="margin">

How are they not ashamed to father such fables vpon the Fathers, contrarie to their own iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this may be an euident argument, that these Legends smell, because they make miracles so common,<note place="margin">Multitude of miracles in the Popish Church ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them suspected. <hi>Vit. Hilarion.</hi>
                     </note> to flow from them in heapes: as that <hi>Hierome</hi> healed six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene blind at once: <hi>Bernard</hi> in one day of all infirmities 39. persons: <hi>Hilarion</hi> is affirmed to haue cured 200. pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with diuels at Cyprus, beside a great many of other diseases. Christ and his Apostles were but bunglers in working miracles to these, if they may haue their saying. <hi>Origen</hi> to <hi>Celsus,</hi> who counted it as a fable that Christ rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some from the dead, maketh this answere: <hi>Si fabulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa haec essent, multos resurrexisse finxisset:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

whereas now three onely are said to haue been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. We may therefore worthily doubt of these straunge reports of miracles, wherein they haue no measure, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth such a beadrole of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we haue the aduersaries owne confession, who themselues suspect the credit of these tales: therefore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the 3. forbiddeth a certaine Popish saint to bee worshipped,<note place="margin">

            <p>First, if the proposition were true, this argument might be retorted vpon them: for in the late dayes of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>England,</hi> many zealous Protestants did not onely forsake all expectation of worldly preferment, but did willinglie forgoe their life for the truth sake, and endured more for their conscience only, then euer did any Papist:

Thirdly, in peaceable gouernment for so many euen 44. yeeres, none came neere her. Fourthly, in loue of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects at home.

blessing to this land. And as Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> loued and liued in peace, so she ended her daies in a good old age, full of yeeres: and, which of all other may worthily be accounted the greatest blessing, hath left the kingdom to a most worthie and noble successor, a professor and protector of the same faith and religion, our renowned King that now is; by whose hands, we doubt not, but that the Lord will accomplish, whatsoeuer he seeth needfull for his Church.</p>
                  <p>But because this Romish southsayer taketh vpon him to play the blind prophet: <hi>What is like</hi> (saith he) <hi>to be the euent thereof hereafter, I had rather others should write and shew their coniecture, which I for reuerence to my Soueraigne will here omit:</hi> And hereupon he <hi>hopeth that his prudent Princesse, will imitate the examples of her noble predecessors</hi>

Hereunto I brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answere, that his <hi>prognostication and exhortation</hi> are both alike, they both shew a dreaming and phantasticall spirit. His foolish hope (we see) is vaine and frustrate: for her Maiestie left her happie raigne in the same faith wherein she began it: and as she did nothing inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately at her entrance, but with great aduice; so had she no cause to repent her in the end. If her Maiesties prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors were inconstant, in pulling downe what before they had set vp, she being appointed of God to be a wise builder, was not therein to follow so simple a plot.</p>
                  <p>As is his hope and expectation, such is his lying spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prophecying.

For otherwise <hi>Luther</hi> taught obedience to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and misliked all tumultuous and disordered cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as it may appeare by his misliking of <hi>Carolostadius</hi> violent proceedings, who stirred vp the people by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence without the Magistrate to cast downe images at <hi>Wittemberge:</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. Though Protestants teach, that onely faith doth iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, yet they affirme not onely faith to be necessarie. And our opinion is,<note place="margin">Faith iustifieth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alone, but must not be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alone.</note> that iustifying faith cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruites: that whereas there are no good workes there is no faith: neither was that euer a right faith, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer brought foorth good workes. It is therefore a foolish consequent brought in by him: Protestants are iustified onely by faith: <hi>Ergo,</hi> felons, murthers, treasons may be
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:20708:120"/>
safely practised among them: for where these things are maintained there is no faith perceiued. Good fruits make not a tree good, but onely declare it to be good: doth it therefore follow, that it is no matter whether a good tree bring foorth fruite or not? nay, if it doe not, it is found to be no good tree. We say therefore with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>they which haue beleeued should be carefull to shew forth good workes;</hi>

                           <hi>these things are good and profitable to men.</hi> But this shall cleere our doctrine of iustification by faith onely from all suspition of treasons, treacheries, that these cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed attempts are not to be found among the <hi>solifidian</hi> Protestants, but among the <hi>nullifidian</hi> Papists, who stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the merite of their workes, make no consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (a great sort of them) to practise against their Prince and countrie, as it hath been more then twentie times in the raigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> attempted by Romish Priests, and Iudasites and their sectaries, and by Gods great mercie and watchfull prouidence discouered.</p>

And with as good right may any other order be restrained from mariage, as Ministers, in respect of the Common-wealth, seeing that they haue the best meanes of education for their children.

As for the rest for poore artificers and labourers, I feare me in most townes of <hi>England,</hi> their meale more then twice or thrice in a weeke costeth them not aboue a penie. And is his meaning such to rake out so many pence out of the hungrie bellies of the poore, whereas (poore soules) their emptie stomacks had neede be better filled: for I dare say that the third man in this land especiallie in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie is of this number, that doth either fast of necessitie, or fareth often very meanely and courselie: he then is like to come short of his reckoning. But I know why he is so eager for these pence, either to help his holie father

                        <p n="3">3 Concerning the great charge of Ministers progenie, admit it come to so much in 40. yeare space, as this Popes auditor hath layd his counters,<note place="margin">Ministers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie not burdenous to the land.</note> to fiue hundred thousand pound and odd, as in deed, it doth not, as is before tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, neither the number of them being so great, nor the charge rising to such a summe: but be it granted: 1. may not the same obiection be vrged against any other order or calling, of lawyers, artificers, labourers, or such like? might not euery parish in <hi>England</hi> spare an artisane or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer some one or other, whereas one Minister is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for euery parish? will not the progenie of any one,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:20708:124"/>
either Tailor, Shoomaker, Weauer, Husbandman, through the land, accounting for euery parish but one, arise in like time to the like multitude? And in his prophane and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish conceit, are Ministers, that draw the people to God no more necessary, then botchers, coblers, hedgers, &amp;c? 2. If the ofspring of Ministers should all be of the same calling, as the sonnes of the Leuites and Priests were, and all be maintained of tithes and offrings, as the other were, they might with greater shew of reason be thought to be burdenous, and yet the other were not: but seeing they are dispersed into other callings, and so diuerslie employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some in trades, some in merchandise, some in profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of learning, some for the seas, some for the warres and other seruices of the King; the same exception might be taken as well against any other of the Kings subiects, as against them. 3. Who seeth not, what a foolish recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he hath made: he maketh account of an 100. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand now after 40. yeares continuance, and of 500. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound now by the yeare increasing, which he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth sufficient for the maintenance of warre, and supplie of taxes &amp;c. But let him be asked what the number of the one was, and the summe of the other, 10.20.30. yeares since? he must come short by so many parts and degrees of his account: and yet so many yeares since, the English warres began, and subsidies were thought needfull to be leuied, when as yet the increase of Ministers and of their charges came not to the fift part after that rate, when as notwithstanding the yearely expences of the warres in <hi>Ireland</hi> and other places did rise to 200. thousand pound by the yeare. 4. But what is this counter-casters meaning? would he haue this summe of 500. thousand leuied yerely of the Clergie?<note place="margin">Of raysing of subsidies.</note> all their reuenues and liuings to a groat will not reach it: wherefore would he haue it collected? to maintaine warres, and spare subsidies? I trust they shall cease: our greatest warres are like to be against the Pope and his adherents. Let it be noted then, that this popeling giueth counsell how warres might be maintained against the Pope his vnholie father, who is the greatest enemie to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:20708:125"/>
this nation. And for the sparing of subsidies and taxes, raised vpon better subiects, I answere, first, that both the occasion thereof, the necessitie of warres being remoued, and the Kings princely disposition so standing, that he would haue subsidies rarely lifted vp, I make no doubt, but hereafter they will more sparingly be required,<note place="margin">

But if they were no better sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects then trayterous Iesuites and Seminaries, I say not it were no great matter if they were one hanged against another; but if they were all shipped to the Sea, and sent to the Indians and Cannibals, or whither else, so they were not in <hi>England.</hi> I thinke the whole land would be in greater quiet and safetie. 5. Lastly, this cruell wretch sheweth himselfe another <hi>Haman,</hi> who to haue the Iewes destroyed offered to bring in 10. thousand talents into the Kings cofers, <hi>Esther.</hi> 3.9.

Though in the choice of Monasticall life, they were conformable to the Romane Church: yet in many other opinions they dissented: for transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not yet hatched, and many grosse errors beside, since forged by that blacke Smith. 4. Neither was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasticall life then like to Popish Monkerie in these daies: their life more chast, their time not so idly spent, their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition not so grosse.

perswaded much more truly: for to his protestation these exceptions may be taken:</p>

                  <p n="3">3. He is conuinced of manifest falshood, in that he dareth auouch, that all the Fathers confirme his faith, and condemne the profession of the Protestants: whereas it is most notoriously euident, that for the grossest points of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, as Transubstantiation, the sacrifice of the Masse, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of images, iustification by workes, the supremacy of the Pope, prohibition of mariage, and such other, they haue no shew at all of any euidence from the Fathers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 500. years after Christ. And in many substantiall points they do apparantly testifie for Protestants: as <hi>Cyprian</hi> for the equalitie of Bishops, <hi>Hierome</hi> for the Canonicall He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Scriptures, <hi>Origene</hi> against the carnall presence, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> against free-will, and election vpon the foresight of our workes, <hi>Ambrose</hi> for iustification by faith. And these and many other such naturall points, these Fathers with others do giue such cleare testimonie to the truth, that it is impudencie to denie it: and yet this brasen face would beare vs down, that they do speak only for papistrie which they neuer knew; and condemned the Euangelicall or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants faith, which they professed. Wherfore this protesta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion hauing no probability of truth, but being deuised for his owne aduantage, and coyned to serue his turne, is of no great credit.
