            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The viſitation (and rightly may it carry that Name) hath now foure times in a few yeares Rode circuite through the whole Kingdome, and kept a dreadfull Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, within <hi>London,</hi> and round about it: Death does at this houre Scout up and downe the Suburbes, and ſhewes his Ghaſtly face in ſome Parriſhes of the Citty.</p>
            <p>Thoſe houſes which are ſhut up, <hi>Charity</hi> opens, and moſt liberally feedes them. Thoſe houſes of poore <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-crafts-men,</hi> that ſtand open, are for want of worke pinch'd with hunger, and the people ready to goe a begging.</p>
            <p>Yet there is one comfort, there is no man (bée he never ſo poore) but méetes in every corner, one poorer than himſelfe: So that, what Adverſities ſoever are
<pb facs="tcp:25175:9"/>
layd upon us, wée are bound to prayſe God, in that wée are not caſt downe to the loweſt Misfortunes in the World, for wée heare of ten thouſands in forteine places, in fatte worſe eſtate then wée are.</p>
            <p>Now, as Men and Women, have a particular cauſe to ſend their Devotions up to Heaven, when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their preſent beings (how wretched ſoever) with others more wretched: So many Townes, Cittyes, and Kingdomes, may (in generall) lift up their eyes with joy, when albeit the Divine vengeance hath ſmote them, with a Mace of Iron: Yet if they looke on their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, miſerably torne in pieces: They behold thoſe over-whelmed with more raging billows then they féele or ſée comming néere themſelves.</p>
            <p>As for example, this goodly and beautifull City of <hi>London,</hi> hath now but a few faynt ſpots ſet in her fleſh: A few peſtilentiall ſores ſticking on her body: But a few Tokens are ſent her, to bid her Remember, who ſées her doings: She heares no great Number of Bels Tolling: No terrible number of Graves are opened in her ſight: Not whole ſtréets of houſes are now ſhut up with Redde Croſſes on the doores: <hi>And Lord have Mercy upon us,</hi> over thoſe doores, to fright Beholders: There are not ſuch Fines, and Incomes, to bée payd for Tenements of the dead, (Heaven be bleſſed) as there were either at the comming of King <hi>Iames</hi> to his Crowne, or of King <hi>Charles</hi> our Soveraigne to his.</p>
            <p>Alas, theſe markes, Printed <hi>(London)</hi> upon thée now, are but Flea-bitinges to the ſtripes which drew blood from thy very Heart, in thoſe dayes of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
            <p>And yet, how art thou Frighted? How pale are thy Chéekes? How does this one fit of a burning Fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er,
<pb facs="tcp:25175:9"/>
inflame all thy body? How doeſt thou ſhake the Head, and complaine, that doings are cold? that Trading lies dead? and that money keepes her bedde, and is not ſtirring.</p>
            <p>How doe thy Coaches, and Caroaches runne thorow thy ſtréets, and ſo out at thy Gates, full of brave, rich people to live ſafe (as they hope) in the Countrey? Not caring how ſorrowfull a life thou leadeſt here in their abſence.</p>
            <p>How little doe they regard the poore, which they leave behinde them? What is it to them, if ſome poore wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches drop downe in the ſtreetes? This touches not them: It wounds not them: Gallants, and Cittizens, take leave of them with much complement at the Coaches ſide, the Coachman with his Hart off, asking if hee ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et forward: On, on, they then all cry, and away (in a Hurry:) thunder they <hi>(O London)</hi> out of thy Reach.</p>
            <p>Yet, caſt thine eye on this Picture above, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee out of his reach: who is ready to follow them, with Times Glaſſe in one hand and his owne blacke darts in the other. This Rawbone Foot-man can runne by the ſide of the Coach-horſes, and ſmite the officious Coachman in the midſt of his journey.</p>
            <p>When in heapes, people ſtand gazing on a dead Corpes ſuddenly ſtrucken downe in the fields: This cunning dart-caſter, can ſtand before them, looke at them, threaten them, and tell them (when hee's bidden but to ſhoote) They ſhall féele the ſtrength of his leane arme, as well as the others.</p>
            <p>And yet, albeit ſo many Waggons laden with Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-ſtuffe, are every day drawn from thee: Albeit ſo many doores are lockt up, and ſo many take their heeles,
<pb facs="tcp:25175:10"/>
and fly in this day of Battaile: Yet their flight is for the moſt part into the mouth of danger. For, the Countrey lookes with a more pale, and ſickly Colour, then <hi>(London)</hi> thou doeſt.</p>
            <p>Rejoyce not that thy Neighbours are ſo ill, but clappe thy hands for joy then thy ſelfe art no worſe. Pray for thy diſtreſſed friends, neighbouring Townes, and Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: And releive them to thy power, if they want: As thou haſt with a Noble, Frée, and bountifull hand done to ſome of late already.</p>
            <p>It is warrantable by the Lawes of God, to ſhunne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and to fly perſecution: Divines and beſt men, dos the one, And the Martyrs when they lived did the other. But now (bleſſed be the white hand of mercy) there are no ſuch Tyrannicall Enemies beating at thy gates.</p>
            <p>If they that are in the fulneſſe of Riches, and the fatneſſe of the Land, have Mannors, and Lordſhipps to ride to: And Countrey houſes to repaire to, for pleaſure, to avoyde infection: In Gods name, let them goe, wiſh them well at their ſetting foorth, welcome them with Embraces at their comming in: But withall put them in minde of one thing, to doe ſome good to the poore in the Country, though now they do none here, and all ſhall be well.</p>
            <p>And you in the Countrey, whoſe Barnes are full of Corne, and whoſe fieldes are crow'nd with bleſſings: You, into whoſe Noſtrilles the breath of Heaven, ſuffers his wholeſome ayre to paſſe to and fro, to give you health, and to make long luſty old age waite upon you at your Tables: To you I ſpeake, your eies doe I wiſh to bée opened. To looke backe at your hard and unkinde dealings with Cittizens, in the two laſt great Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes:
<pb facs="tcp:25175:10"/>
Remember how your Infidelity then, hath beene puniſhed ſince: And therefore welcome the Sonnes, and Daughters of <hi>London</hi> comming to you now, as if they were your owne.</p>
            <p>This Sickneſſe call'd the Plague, hath a quick foot, and a ſtirring hand: Yet (bleſſed be the ſender of this dreadfull Purſivant) he has not béene too buſie with us as yet: Let your eyes but looke beyond Seas, into other Citties and you will acknowledge the Almighties Mercy wonderouſly extended to us. For, thoſe thrée puniſhments (Sword, Peſtilence, and Famine,) of which, <hi>Davids</hi> Prophet bid him (from an Angels mouth) make his choyce of one, doe at this inſtant hotly lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them in ſome part of <hi>Italy</hi>: In ſo much, that for 4. Moneths, (Now in this Summer) there have dyed of the Plague in <hi>Millan,</hi> 30000. In <hi>Mantua,</hi> 36000. In <hi>Parma,</hi> 20000. And ſo in other Citties great number beſides.</p>
            <p>The ſoft wings of compaſsion, all this while Cover us, not that wée deſerve to be ſpared, but that out of his love, God does ſpare us. For in this laſt blow, which hée gives us, bée fights not with many old men, he gives them time yet to repent, nor with many young men, hée winkes at their faults a while, hoping they will bée wiſer: But looke over all your wéekely Bils, ever ſince there dyed at firſt but one, and you ſhall finde, of Infants and young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, twenty for one ſnatched out of their Cradles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God will bée ſure to increaſe his Saints in Heaven.</p>
            <p>The king of kings when hée ſées his time, ſhorten and end theſe miſeries, and powre downe his wonted bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings on this Land, This Citty, us all, AMEN.</p>
