            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have deſired me to Print my Sermon, and I deſire you to Practiſe it; becauſe, 'tis never ſo well printed as when 'tis pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed: And give me leave to tell you, that if I could order you ſo well, as you can or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me, you ſhould practiſe it as well as I print it: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, I will perform my part.</p>
            <p>Our preſent age has been an age of wonders, I offer only three (and thoſe the greateſt of them) to your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: We have had the beſt of Princes barbarouſly murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; A baniſht Prince miraculouſly reſtored; And a loyal people (as yet) but badly requited.</p>
            <p>To the firſt of theſe you owe your ſolemn ſorrows, for the ſecond your conſtant thanks, and to the third your juſt <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For theſe I was willing to obey your commands, for theſe I choſe my Text, for theſe I have pleaded, and for theſe I have done what I never did before, I have printed what was pleaded for them, that, in caſe they miſs of any other or better remembrance, (as they have done hitherto) yet they may meet with ſome ſlender one at leaſt upon a paper.</p>
            <p>'Tis confeſt, you have done your duty well and handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the two firſt of theſe wonders, by anſwering them both,
<pb facs="tcp:39477:3"/>
with proportionable and becomming affections; you have mourned ſoundly for the firſt, and reforced luſtily at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: Theſe things you ought to have done, yet not to leave the other undone; undone it is as yet, and ſo are they for whom it ſhould be done; and they can ſay it from as profound an experience, as any part of Mankind, Eccleſ. <hi>8. 14. There is a vanity, which is done upon the earth, that there be juſt men, unto whom it hapneth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the work of the wicked: Again, there be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, to whom it hapneth according to the work of the righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is this Subject, I am now upon, a very poor one, yet a very good one, and a very good one, becauſe a very Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al one, and if Novelty makes any thing acceptable (as it does) then this paper may challenge your acceptance, becauſe it treats of a <hi>Subject</hi> never (as yet) thought upon, of a <hi>Subject</hi> never handled by any, but very courſly, very wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
            <p>It is now in your power to do them right, that have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered wrong, and to feed and relieve theſe hungry ones, and the honour of the Action will be this, that hereby you wil be followers of God: <hi>For, the Lord executeth judgment for the oppreſſed, he giveth food to the hungry, he looſeth the priſoners, and raiſeth them that are bowed down,</hi> Pſal. <hi>146. 7, 8. Be ye therefore merciful even as your heavenly Father is merciful:</hi> As he is now, he is merciful both to the juſt, and to the unjuſt; be merciful to both you may, but, to be merciful to the unjuſt only, and not to the juſt alſo, this is cruelty; if honeſt men may not have the preference in your mercy, you cannot do leſse, then let them go ſharers with others, that have far leſs (if at all) deſerv'd it.</p>
            <p>'Tis very poſsible, (and, <hi>I</hi> fear, very probable,) that
<pb facs="tcp:39477:3"/>
many years may not bring forth ſuch a <hi>Temper, and Complexion of Parliament,</hi> as this is, in which you ſit: for 'tis a thing as full of Hazard, as the project of the <hi>great Elixir,</hi> which miſſes a hundred times, before it hits once; your children to many Generations may ſadly deſire to ſee one of the days of ſuch a <hi>Convention,</hi> and yet not ſee it: <hi>Therefore, behold, now is the accepted time; behold now is the day of ſalvation: To day therefore (after ſo long a time) whilſt it is ſaid, to day; harden not your hearts;</hi> if you do, and (with <hi>Eſau)</hi> ſell your own, and others <hi>birth-rights, afterwards, when you would inherit the bleſſing, you will be rejected, though you ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>You love, and are for <hi>Loyalty, I</hi> know you are; and if you be, then cheriſh what you love: let that tree have the moſt, and beſt <hi>care and water,</hi> the beſt <hi>ſoil and fence,</hi> which gives you the fruit you moſt love.</p>
            <p>It was a crueltie no where to be found; but in a <hi>Nero, Ardet Roma, dum cythara canit:</hi> And ſhal we (as Iſrael, <hi>Amos. 6, 4, 5; 6.) lye upon beds of Ivory, and ſtretch our ſelves upon our Couches, and eat the lambs out of the Flock, and the Calves out of the midſt of the ſtall? ſhall we chant to the ſound of the Viol, and invent to our ſelves inſtruments of Muſick? ſhall we drink wine in bowles, and anoint our ſelves with the chief oyntments, and not be grieved for the Affliction of</hi> Joſeph? If ſo, what will follow? even the judgment we now fear, <hi>ver. 7. the banquet of them that ſtretched themſelves, ſhall be removed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> am apt to think, that <hi>David</hi> bluſht, when, <hi>having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained reſt from all his Enemies round about, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting quietly in his houſe,</hi> he told the Prophet, <hi>2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sam. 7. 1, 2.

               <pb facs="tcp:39477:4"/>
               <hi>of God dwelleth within curtains;</hi> and they were very courſe ones too, for they were made of Goats hair: Such a bluſh would become you, and you will never look ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly as when this brings up the Reds into your Cheeks, to conſider, that the Lord hath given you reſt, and hath ſet you down peaceably in your houſes; and yet all this while, <hi>theſe Men</hi> (like the Arke) remain clad in courſe and torn gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and though the foxes have holes, and the birds of the Air have neſts, yet theſe men have not a place where to lay down their heads.</p>
            <q xml:lang="lat">
               <l>—pudet haec opprobria nobis</l>
               <l>Et dici potuiſſe, &amp; non potuiſſe refelli.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Methinks, 'tis enough to make you ſhake, and ſweat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to conſider how open you lye to the just complaints of <hi>theſe poor ſouls,</hi> if they ſhould beſpeak you in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Apoſtle, (then in a caſe much like theirs now) <hi>1 Cor. 4. 8.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as Kings without us, and we would to God, ye did reign, that we alſo might reign with you: For we think, that God hath ſet forth us laſt, as it were men appointed to death; for we are made a ſpectacle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and to angels, and to men: we are fools, but ye are wiſe; we are weak, but ye are ſtrong; ye are honourable, but we are deſpiſed: even unto this preſent hour we both hunger, and thirſt, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place: And labour, working with our own hands; being revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, we bleſſe; being perſecured, we ſuffer it; being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the off-ſcouring of all things unto this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:39477:4"/>
And if this be their Caſe, (as indeed it is,) then, how juſt and ingenuous will it be for you, to conſider it: And remember, that if it be <hi>juſt and good with God, that our light afflictions, which are but for a moment, ſhould work for us a far more exceeding, and eternal weight of glory:</hi> then certainly he will not take it well at your hands, if their heavy afflictions, which have been for many years, ſhould work nothing for them, but a far more exceeding and inſupportable weight of want and miſery.</p>
            <p>I have forgot the <hi>Name,</hi> but I remember the <hi>Vertue</hi> of that great Commander, who when his Army was much diſtreſt in point of <hi>Aquation,</hi> and a bottle of water was preſented to himſelf by one of his Souldiers, he flung it on the ground, and this after it, <hi>God forbid, that I ſhould drink, when my poor Souldiers are periſhing with thirſt:</hi> And the kindneſſe of <hi>Alexander</hi> (if <hi>Curtius</hi> may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>àted) was as great as himſelf, who in a cold froſty night ſitting by a great fire in an open field, and eſpying a poor Souldier upon an out-gard ready to drop down dead with the Cold, ran to him, took him up in his Arms, brought him to the Fire, ſet him in his own Chair, rubb'd and chafed him with his own hands, and with much ado brought him to life Theſe wiſe men knew this to be the way, to oblige an Army to them.</p>
            <p>I leave this with you, to apply, and to divine what I mean by it; and withal, you may do well to remember, how many of your own families received both their <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Eſtates</hi> from the <hi>Norman ſervice:</hi> That <hi>juſt Prince</hi> thought it his duty to requite his <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and if you would know the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of <hi>Miles, Eques, Comes,</hi> &amp;c. which you now wear about your Eſchutcheons, they are <hi>flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> which grew up out of <hi>that Field,</hi> far unlike thoſe weeds, which now ſpring from a ſervice as ingenuous and juſt as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:39477:5"/>
that for which the Herauldy is ſo much altered, that they yet wear no other badg, then <hi>Pedes, Pauper, Famelicus,</hi> for being Loyal to their Prince.</p>
            <p>Methinks, 'tis not ſo handſome, to ſee a Nation (that was lately <hi>Gules</hi> all over) now to ſtand checker'd <hi>Argent</hi> and <hi>Sable,</hi> and to behold our late <hi>great Mercy of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns Reſtauration,</hi> like that Pillar <hi>Exod. 14. 20. Cloud and darkneſſe to ſome, but light to others;</hi> nor are Things well in Tune, when (as at the building of the ſecond temple, <hi>Ezra 3. 13)</hi> we cannot diſcern the noiſe of the ſhout of joy, from the noiſe of the weeping of the people, when one part (the more antient and righteous) may weep it out with the Poet,

And another (more novel and criminal,) ſhall triumph it with an <hi>O quàm bonum jucundum,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>And let no man recriminate this <hi>addreſſe,</hi> from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and debauchery of the Perſons, for whom 'tis made. I remember the check and aſperſion, given of old by the Phariſees to Chriſt, who cenſured him <hi>for eating with Publicans and Sinners,</hi> when he had no where elſe to go: 'Tis a very hard piece of Juſtice, to cenſure and condemn men for eating and drinking in publick houſes, when they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39477:5"/>
have <hi>no Houſes left them of their own, to eat and to drink in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be Oaths and Atheiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more viſible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, then others, it will lye very much at the doors of their <hi>Oppreſſors.

A breath from your lips is able to quicken this field of dry bones into an Army of Vertuoſo's.</p>
            <p>I will not preſcribe to your Wiſedoms what to do for them nor adventure at <hi>reaſons of State,</hi> why ſomething muſt be done: There are many and great ones, but you can give them to your ſelves; they are thoſe of Religion, which I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you, and if Juſtice and Charity be your duties, and the <hi>Compaſſe</hi> of your Actions, then this is.</p>
            <p>If you will do no more for them, yet remember them, give them (at leaſt) a place in your Annals and Records; God has (among many other Books) a <hi>book of Remembrance, Mal. 3. 16.</hi> and in this Book he records the ſufferings of good men, <hi>Pſal. 56. 8. Their tears are put up in his bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and written in his Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it ſeems by that paſſage concerning <hi>Mordecai, Heſt. 6. 1, 2, 3.</hi> that it was the manner of the Eaſtern Princes to record <hi>the ſervices and ſufferings</hi> of good Subjects to poſterity, as ſoon as they were done or ſuffered: And there
<pb facs="tcp:39477:6"/>
were Scribes among the Jews (if my conjecture fail not) whoſe peculiar office it was to do this; and truly the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> there, deſerves to be commended to the practiſe of Princes, <hi>ver. 1.</hi> he was reading one night in his book of <hi>Records,</hi> and found the good ſervice of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> in diſcovering a Treaſon againſt his Perſon. v. <hi>2.</hi> and then puts a queſtion (and it is <hi>Queſtio rege digna) what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity hath been done to</hi> Mordecai <hi>for this?</hi> v. <hi>3.</hi> 'twas anſwered, <hi>there was nothing done for him.</hi> But it was not long ere ſomething was.</p>

their garments of all Ribbonds and other dreſſes when they Mourn; ſo I think, if plain garments be faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable there, a plain Sermon will be ſeaſonable here.</p>
            <p>This people (here concerned in the Text) were a Nation much addicted to outward and formall duties, and among others to this of Faſting; the ſecond verſe before the Text, will deſcribe you this; And how pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and ceremonious they were in it, the 5. verſe (which is part of the Text) does decypher: It ſeems, this formality ran down the whole current of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: for when I look almoſt home to the end of it (in the dayes of Chriſt) I find the ſame humour ſtirring amongſt the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> of whom Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 16. that when they faſted, they were <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is (as one interprets it) they would look like <hi>Scythians;</hi> and they did (as is obſerved in the Text before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, they either cover'd their faces with black-hoods, or elſe (as one accutely obſerves it out of Antiquity) they uſed a paint or fucus to make them ſeem ſad and mortified; and the great errour of them was, to think, that when this was done, the Faſt was over.</p>
            <p>Now the buſineſſe of this Text (with the cohaerents) is to reprove, and with reproving to reject, this formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of faſting, and to commend and teach the true reality of it.</p>
            <p>And (indeed) theſe are the parts of the Text.</p>

            </list>
            <p>And both theſe are done in the way of expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which argues a more then ordinary vehemency in what is ſpoken.</p>

               <hi>Is it ſuch a faſt?</hi> which is an ardent Negation, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by no means it is not at all ſuch a faſt.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So that in the firſt, all formalities of a faſt (when they go alone) are rejected; theſe Jewiſh formalities in the Text, <hi>to afflict the ſoul, to bow down the head like a Bull ruſh, &amp;c.</hi> And on the ſame ſcore our Chriſtian for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of faſting all the day, meeting in the Houſe of publick Worſhip, making long Prayers, and hearing five or fix Sermons, one on the neck of another; theſe (I ſay) when they go alone, are rejected; and our own obſervation can teſtifie, they have been ſo.</p>

            </p>
            <p>That, which (without any violence) is deducible from the Text, may be reduced to theſe three Particulars, within which I ſhall confine all I have to ſay.</p>

               <item>Firſt, that faſting is a duty.</item>
               <item>Secondly, that God in ſome caſes does reject it.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, what muſt be done to make it acceptable.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. I begin with the firſt. That faſting is a duty, this is plain in the Text; where though we have <hi>rejectionem modi,</hi> yet not <hi>rei,</hi> of that manner of faſting, not of faſting it ſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.

faſt that has nothing but formalities, and mediate duties in it <hi>vocem &amp; praeterea nihil,</hi> a cymbal-faſt, that makes a noiſe and hath no charity; this Good rejecteth.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon is becauſe to the moral goodneſſe of an action, there is required not only the matter and bulk of the fact, the manufacture and outward body of it, but many circumſtances to make it good. <hi>St. Aug.</hi> obſerves it in the point of delivering up Chriſt unto death, how much the end and intention in an act does diverſifie the act it ſelf; <hi>Pater tradid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t filium</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Judas Dominum, Christus ſerpſum,</hi> one and the ſame act <hi>(viz)</hi> the giving up of Chriſt was mercy in God, love in Chriſt, but treaſon in the Apoſtate: So here, as the Apoſtle ſayes of the law, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 8. that it is good if a man uſe it lawfully; ſo is the duty of faſting, good or evil, as it ſtands qualified by the end and intention of the perſons.</p>
            <p>In the 4. verſe before the Text the faſt was evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the intention was ſo, <hi>The faſt for ſtrife and debate,</hi> &amp;c. and verſe 6. and 7. of the Text, the faſt is allowed to be good and acceptable, if it ſtand aſſociated with the duties of Juſtice and Mercy,</p>
            <p>Clear it is then, that faſting is our duty, and the more clear, becauſe we have occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>The firſt: one is judgement impending or incumbing, at the door, or in the houſe. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 12. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of an Invaſion, <hi>and in that day</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>did the Lord call to weeping and mourning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though we read not of any Prophet, that by word of mouth required the people to it, yet there was <hi>vox virgae, Mic.</hi> 6. 9. the Rod had a tongue, there was a Summons in the preſent Providence, there was a <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal ad portas,</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> was at the gates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:39477:8"/>
And leſt the Call of Providence ſhould be thought not loud enough, we have an expreſſe ſummons from the Word to this duty, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 15. 16, 17. the 15. ver. gives us the Precept, <hi>Sanctifie a faſt,</hi> &amp;c. the 16. verſe ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons the Perſons, and thoſe are all concerned, <hi>the people, congregation, young and old,</hi> &amp;c. And the 17 verſe gives us the duty, Prayer; <hi>Spare thy people, O Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and this was the practiſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who like a flock of ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ep, though in times of ſafety and peace, they wandred abroad ſecurely in their ſeveral paſtures; yet when the Dog, or Woolf drew near, they ran together to this Duty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, another occaſion to this duty, is ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant enterpriſe or undertaking, that has danger and difficulty in it: Thus did <hi>Heſter,</hi> who going to pacifie the anger of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> towards the Jews, and to gain his favor (a thing dangerous, and difficult to be had from ſo great a Prince) bids the people <hi>faſt for this, and not eat nor drink three days, night or day; and (I ſaid ſhe) and my maidens will faſt likewiſe, and ſo will I go to the King, (though it be not according to Law,) and if I periſh I periſh;</hi> And as the enterprize was great, ſo the faſt made it proſperous: Thus the Apoſtles, being to ordain, and ſend abroad Miniſters to the Gentiles, (an affair of greater danger and difficulty, (and importance too) than the former) <hi> they prayed unto the Lord and faſted,</hi> and having ſo done, <hi>they laid their hands on</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>and ſent them away,</hi> Acts 13. 2, 3. which practiſe of theirs (methinks) give no mean warrant to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Ember weeks, preparatory to the Laying on of hands.</p>
            <p>The things muſt be great and good; and when ſo, they muſt be faſted for; <hi>not for ſtrife and debate, nor</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:39477:9"/>
               <hi>to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſſe,</hi> not for a proſperous Rebellion, or Regicide (for that's the Engliſh of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,) ſuch faſts are to be faſted for, and faſted from, and the late ſignal confutations given out by Providence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch faſts, are evidence enough, we ought not to faſt for ſuch things. And indeed as all other ſervice, ſo this of faſting, (as the Apoſtle ſtyles it) <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>a reaſonable ſervice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God expects from us, a demeanour ſuitable to our condition; and as he was juſtly condemn'd, that came without a wedding garment to the feaſt, ſo may he no leſſe that wears it at a faſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11. 10. We are required <hi>to walk after the Lord</hi> in his diſpenſations, <hi>and when he ſhal roar like a Lyon, then ought we</hi> (like good children) <hi>to tremble;</hi> 'Tis a piece of moſt intolerable inſolence, for men to laugh and ſport themſelves when God frownes: this in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſo offenſive, that, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 22. 14. becauſe, when God call'd <hi>to weeping and to mourning, there was found amongſt them joy and gladneſſe, eating fleſh, and drinking wine;</hi> &amp;c. therefore <hi>that iniquity ſhould not be purged from them till they dyed:</hi> It ſeems to be a moſt unpardonable, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling iniquity; it adds wings to the leaden feet of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and ſets on work her iron hands; it makes her come faſter, and ſtrike deeper; it was this that brought in the deluge upon the antient world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24, 38. becauſe <hi>they were eating and drinking,</hi> &amp;c. therefore the flood came, and took them all away.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a diſcreet obſervation of judgments (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther near us or upon us,) will naturally beget ſuch a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind in us, as will produce this duty; For in the way of a natural operation, when we are in pain, in fear, in danger, or under any ſort of diſcontent, we weep,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39477:9"/>
we cry, we pray, we faſt; <hi>when he flew them</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) then they ſought him. Damocles</hi> (though ſet down at a plentiful Table) yet could not eat bit, becauſe of the Sword, that was ſo ſubtilly hung over him; where ever there is a proſpect or fear of a judgment, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this; 'tis true, if a man were a beaſt (and they are little leſſe that do ſo) void of fore-ſight and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he might be allowed to graze on though it thunders, and like the ſwine eat his meat as luſtily an hour before his throat is cut, as at any time before; And let not our Hilariors take it ill, that I cannot range them amongſt any other ſort of Cattel: For to be ſenſeleſſe and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual at the approach of judgments, is for want of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the very <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves (when in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) were not ſtrangers to this duty: <hi>Nineveh</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted from the King to the Beggar, and from the Beggar to the Beaſt for the threat that <hi>Jonas</hi> gave them: And this alſo makes it a reaſonable ſervice.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the reaſon of this duty further appears, in that the very outward act of faſting doth qualifie and diſpoſe a man unto thoſe other duties, that are more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial; for if Prayer, Confeſſion, Contrition, are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that do much conduce to deliverance and mercy; and if it be Gods uſual method never to take us up till he finds us on our knees; when are 'we ſo fit for theſe duties, as when we faſt? <hi>For the corruptible body</hi> (as you have it Wiſd. 9. 15.) <hi>preſſeth down the Soul, and the earthly Tabernacle weigheth down the mind that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth upon many things.</hi> Now we have many things to muſe upon in this duty, and faſting unclogs the ſoul, and takes off that mire and dirt that hangs about the wings of the mind, whereby it mounts much higher in all ſpiritual acts; And therefore the caveat of Chriſt is

               </gap> the word is) <hi>ne ingraventur,</hi> leſt your hearts be made heavy. Intemperance takes off the wheels of the Soul, and makes it drive heavily.</p>
            <p>A duty then it is, in that there are juſt occaſions of it, and ſtrong reaſons for it: but let it be never ſo much a duty, and never ſo often done, yet in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes God rejects it. And this tranſlates me over into the ſecond particular, which is to make inquiry in what ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and for what cauſes, God does reject the faſtings and humiliation of men.</p>
            <p>Rejected they are, it ſeems, ſometimes: For in thever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the Text we find an expreſſe prohibition: <hi>You ſhall not faſt as you do this day;</hi> and though it may ſeem ſtrange to find a Yea and a Nay in God, to command and inhibit the ſame thing; to make it ſometimes a duty, and yet charge it as a fin; there muſt be ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for this, and it nearly concerns us to inquire what they are.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then God rejects our faſtings, when he finds nothing elſe but form and outward ſolemnity in them: It is the ſaying of Chriſt, Luke 16. 15. <hi>That which is highly eſteemed among men, is abomination in the ſight of God.</hi> What is highly eſteemed among men you may find it 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>Man looketh on the outward appearance,</hi> but God does not, he cannot indure an out-ſide when it goes alone. Here in the Text God abhors their humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for this very reaſon, in that they made it up with a bundle of Ceremonies, geſtures, cryings aloud, forbearing meat, looking ſad, and wearing ſack-cloth, and ſo did only <hi>Hiſtriones agere</hi> perſonate a faſt, and were no more concerned in't, than the Actors are concerned in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the plot,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:39477:10"/>
Secondly, God rejecteth our humiliations, when they are ſet on work meerly for the removal of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the attainder of mercies; to faſt meerly for the one, as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, that there is a faith of Devils, ſo we may call this the faſt of Devils: that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall humiliation and contrition that is now practis'd in Hell, and thoſe Howlings, Weepings, and gnaſhings of Teeth, that are there among the damned, are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and effect of their never-dying torments. And to faſt meerly for the attainder of the other, is no better then the faſt of dogs and ſwine, who howl and make a noiſe becauſe their Trough is empty; and God gives it no better name, when he tels them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>That They did not cry unto him with their heart, but howled upon their beds and aſsembled themſelves for Corn and Wine:</hi> It is therefore the proper errand of an humbled people to confeſſe their ſin, and to beg pardon and grace, and let providence take care for the reſt; eſpecially, when it ſtands encircled in a promiſe, that if we ſeek theſe firſt, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> all other things ſhall be added to us. It concerns us of this Nation to conſider this, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſtate the reaſon of our humiliations: for we have had faſtings for judgments (and have on this day,) but not one as yet for ſin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, 'tis not every faſting for ſin that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, but in ſome caſes does reject it, though it be for ſin; And that is, when we humble our ſelves for ſuch ſins, which lye in our own power to reform and remove: There is the ſame Non-ſenſe and Abſurdity in this caſe, as when an able luſty fellow lies in a ditch and cries, God help. We have a pregnant inſtance of Gods rejection of our faſtings in this caſe, in that of <hi>Joſhua, Joſh.</hi> 7. 6. A ſin was committed by <hi>Achan</hi> and conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39477:11"/>
and the people for that ſin were defeated more then once by the men of <hi>Ai; Joſhua</hi> a publick Magiſtrate (upon this) <hi>fell to his humiliation, rent his cloaths, fell to the Earth upon his face; put duſt upon his head and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> But all this God rejects, and in the 10. verſe gives a ſmart check unto it, <hi>get the up, wherefore lyeſt thou thus upon thy face?</hi> and in the 13 verſe calls him out to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, <hi>Up, ſanctifie the people,</hi> and made a diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after the accurſed thing; God hath given the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate a Sword, and he muſt not bear that Sword in vain. When ſin and prophaneſſe abound in a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through the Magiſtrates neglect or Cowardice, 'tis not his nor our faſting will remove it; becauſe he hath a more effectual means in his hands to do it: And in Gods account ſuch a faſt is as ridiculous as if an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band man coming into his Vineyard, and finding it ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with Bryars and Thorns, ſhould fling aſide his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hook and fall to his prayers, that God would weed them out.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God rejects the faſtings of men when they except and reſerve the practiſe of ſome beloved boſom ſins unto themſelves; this is noted with a more then ordinary indignation, Jer. 7, 9, 10, 11, <hi>Will you ſteal, murther, and commit adultery, and ſwear falſly, &amp;c. and come and ſtand before me in this houſe which is called by my name, and ſay, we are delivered to do all theſe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations? is this houſe which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? behold I (even I) have ſeen it, ſaith the Lord.</hi> We may Engliſh it thus, will you come and faſt before the Lord for fear of Famine and Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and put exceptions to Rebellion, Regicide, Oppreſſion, and the detainder of other mens bread? <hi>Is this the faſt that I have choſen?</hi> one ſuch <hi>Dalilah</hi> is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39477:11"/>
enough to deſtroy the ſtrongeſt <hi>Samſon;</hi> one ſuch <hi>Agag,</hi> is ſufficient to undo the talleſt <hi>Saul;</hi> one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted ſin, will make void the beſt of faſts and as long as <hi>Achan,</hi> with his wedge and garment lay undiſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, unbrought out, let not <hi>Iſrael</hi> except to proſper; ſuch a day as this ought to be a day of ſlaughter, and if God at another time will deal impartially with us for our ſins, then it concerns us now to deal impartially with them, and not to roul any one (no not the moſt beloved one,) as a ſweet morſel under the tongue, for fear it prove as the book which was given to Saint <hi>John</hi> to eat, <hi>though ſweet</hi> in the mouth, <hi>yet bitter</hi> in the belly. I have known the whole work of a Chirurgion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, by ſuch a partiality as this; and, becauſe he ſearched not at the bottom, though he skinn'd it over to the eye, the wound did feſter and ſuppurate, and he was forced to begin again: If you will make ſuant work in your faſting, bring out the bottom of your ſins, do not keep back a part, and this may heal the land.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, The faſtings of men are rejected, when they will not be convinced of ſome ſins that they are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as in the caſe of ſhedding innocent blood, when we have ſhed it, and call it juſtice; faſt while you will in this perſwaſion, God will not accept it, 'tis plain enough <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. from the 10. to the 15. ver. In the 10. ver. God gives his own people very ſad names, <hi>Rulers of Sodom, and people of Gomorrha;</hi> and in the following verſes, he gives all their ſervices a very ſad reception: <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices unto me? I delight not, &amp;c. Who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? incenſe is an abomination to me, the new Moons and Sabbaths, and the calling of aſſemblies I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:39477:12"/>
               <hi>away with, it is iniquity even the ſolemn meetings my ſoul hateth them, they are a trouble unto me, I am weary to hear them; and when ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea when you make many prayers, I will not hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſtrange diſlike! and were there not a reaſon given for it, never enough to be wondred at, That God ſhould abandon the very ſervice that he does command, and what's that reaſon? God that does nothing without the higheſt reaſon gives you his in the bottom of the 15. ver. (and indeed it is like ſome cholerick diſtemper in the bottom of the ſtomack, which makes us vomit up all we eat,) <hi>Your hands are full of blood:</hi> When bloud is upon a Nation unacknowledged, unrepented, it mars all the ſervices of it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, God does reject the faſtings of men when they are undertaken to promote bad ends, and wicked purpoſes: ſuch a faſt was that of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 9. She proclaimed a faſt, that under the colour of a treſpaſs againſt that proclamation, ſhe might obtain the life and vineyard of <hi>Naboth:</hi> And the faſtings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are here rejected in this Chapter, becauſe they were undertaken to <hi>promote ſtrife and debate,</hi> and proſperouſly to <hi>ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs:</hi> And in the 3 ver. more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the reaſon is given, becauſe <hi>in the day of your faſt you finde pleaſure,</hi> that is, (as the vulgar renders it,) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venitur voluntas veſtra,</hi> You bring with you your own wills, deſires, deſigns, and hope to carry them on by faſting; and, as it follows, you <hi>exact all your labours, Omnes debitores veſtros repetitis,</hi> You beg of God a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous vengeance upon thoſe you think have wrong'd you; ſuch low and baſe ends do no more juſtifie a faſt then when a Robber prays for an advantageous Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39477:12"/>
or a Pirate for a fair wind at Sea; If we thus bring in the tables of Money-changers into the houſe of God, and come here to truck with him, for the grant of our own deſires, he will over-throw thoſe tables, and ſcourge out ſuch Merchants: If we faſt to ſatisfie our own ambition, cruelty, or covetuouſneſſe, we pervert the end of this duty, by bringing that hither to be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, which ſhould be brought hither to be ſlain; and truly (if I might have leave to give my judgment,) I cannot underſtand why ſo great a defeat has been given out from God, upon thoſe many humiliations (ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to me very ſolemn and ſerious,) which were acted by this Nation, and eſpecially in this place, for theſe laſt 20. years, inſomuch as we might expoſtulate as this people did in the 3. ver. <hi>Wherfore have we faſted, and thou ſeest not; wherefore have we afflicted our Souls and thou takeſt no knowledge?</hi> I ſay, I can give no reaſon for ſuch diſappointment, but this, we propoſed baſe and degenerate ends in our faſtings, we faſted to devour the comforts of other men with a better ſtomack, and to make our ſelves rich by their ruine.</p>
            <p>You ſee then that the faſtings of men may be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and you have ſeen in what caſes, 'twill now be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to put ſuch a queſtion, as he did in the Goſpel, <hi>Good Maſter, what good thing muſt</hi> I <hi>do that</hi> I <hi>may obtain eternal life?</hi> ſo here, what good thing muſt we do, to make our faſting acceptable unto God? The anſwer to this, you will have in the third particular upon which I am now entring.</p>
            <p>The proper ingredients therefore of a Faſt to make it acceptable are not for to ſeek, for you may quickly find them in the 16, &amp; 17. ver. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. <hi>Ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:39477:13"/>
Firſt, <hi>Ceaſe to do evil,</hi> then do we faſt indeed when we faſt from ſin; 'tis not our witholding meat from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but our withdrawing all ſorts of ſupplements from our luſts, that makes a faſt; The luſts of our hearts have wide mouths and craving ſtomacks; Ambition, would never ceaſe aſpiring, till it perch on the circle of the world; Covetuouſneſſe would ingroſſe all the riches of the <hi>Indies;</hi> Revenge, would glut it ſelf with the blood of others; and it is the work of thoſe that faſt, to tye up theſe, and keep them ſhort, to lay ſiedge to them, and intercept their proviſions, the beſt way to k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll them, is to ſtarve them out; That expreſſion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is very apt, Gal. 5. 24. <hi>They that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh:</hi> now, crucifixion is to faſten and bind down a living creature to that which is croſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. Our luſts are thoſe living creatures, and to crucifie them is to feed them with contraries; Pride, would have a Crown of Gold give it a Crown of thorns; Luxury, would have the generous wine, give it vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar mingled with gall: 'tis no faſting except this be done, and therefore Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> doth elegantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid a faſt that is kept without this, <hi>Carnem non com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medis, ſed comedis fratrem, à vino abſtines, ſed ab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, <hi>Learn to do well,</hi> this indeed is the very glory and accompliſhment of a faſt. But what that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well is, that's the queſtion: To Worſhip God is to do well, to hear, to pray, is to do well, but yet this is not the doing well here required; yea, this doing well is rejected and ſpurned at of God, if there be no other ſorts of well-doing going with it; and what that

is you have in the 17. ver. of Iſai. 1. <hi>Relieve (or righten) the oppreſsed, judge the fatherleſſe, plead for the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis clear then that the duties of Juſtice and Mercy are not only the Ornaments, but the eſſentials of a faſt; they are made ſo in the Text, <hi>where there are any bands of wickedneſse they muſt be looſed, any heavie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens they must be undone, any oppreſſed ones they muſt go free, any yoke it muſt be broken, any that are hungry thy bread muſt be dealt unto them, any that are poor and caſt out they muſt be brought to thy houſe, any naked thou muſt cover him;</hi> and good reaſon, for in the bottom of the verſe, <hi>he is thine own fleſh,</hi> at what wideneſſe ſoever we are differenced by other things in the world, yet the pooreſt man alive is <hi>thy own fleſh,</hi> and in all thy acts of mercy to him, thou art merciful to a part of thy ſelf; This is <hi>the faſt,</hi> and how importunately the Spirit of God harps upon this ſtring, and points us (as it were with the finger) to this, even to this ſort of duty, you may further ſee in <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 9, 10. where, after a reproof given to their formal faſtings, verſe 5. a rule is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned for them what to do: <hi>Execute true Judgment, and ſhew Mercy and Compaſſion every man to his Brother, and oppreſſe not the Widdow, nor the Fatherl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſe, the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor the poor, and let none of you imagine evil againſt his Brother in your heart.</hi> It is a ſtrange preference, and much to be wonder'd at, which God gives to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we owe to man, before thoſe we owe to himſelf? methinks it were enough to ſay, that the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is <hi>like unto the firſt</hi> Math. 22. 39. but to ſay, <hi>firſt go and be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy gift;</hi> to ſay, <hi>I will have Mercie rather then Sacrifice,</hi> as Gods goodneſs in this to be wondred at,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39477:14"/>
ſo mans duty from this is to be concluded on, that our works of Mercy, Juſtice, Charity, muſt be done by us with as great a zeal, and with a greater earlineſs, then thoſe very ſervices which we do to God.</p>
            <p>There is now left nought remaining to trouble your patience with, but my application and your practiſe. You are here mett in the houſe of God, and what to do? to faſt; and for what? the ſuſpicions and fears of a famine like to come upon us, from our late abundance of Rain, threatning to ſpoil the Fruits of the Earth. 'Tis very well, that any thing will drive us home to God; but yet it is obſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble how early we are in this duty; we faſt for a judgement that is not yet upon us, further then the fear and ſuſpition of it: It would be much more ingenuous to be early and quick in faſting for the ſins of the Nation, as we are for the dangers of it: thoſe (I am ſure) are ripe enough and ready for the ſickle; we are much beyond the Suſpicions of ſin, we are under the Commiſſions of it; and yet, as yet, we have had no faſt for theſe.

            <p>But ſince it is ſo, that the work of this day ſtands ſtated to my hands, upon this bottom, it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient before I can direct you how to be rid of this judgement, to give you my judgement whence it comes: For aſſuredly 'tis no <hi>brutum fulmen,</hi> no arrow ſhot at rovers, no accident ſlipp'd out of the womb of chance without any ſignification in it: no, no; as God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39477:14"/>
is the higheſt Reaſon, ſo all that he does comes from it, and is guided by it; his very judgements themſelves are reaſonable judgements: and therefore though many things come forth from God, the cauſes of which ſhall not be known untill the day <hi>of the revelation of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> yet in the generall he bids us believe, and would have us know, <hi>that he hath not done without cauſe all that he hath done,</hi> Ezek. 14 23.</p>
            <p>Well then, a reaſon for this judgement there is, and what is it? to tell you that it is Wickedneſſe in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is to fling an whole loaf at your head, and not to cut it for you; but yet the Pſalmiſt tells us ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 34. <hi>He turneth a faithfull land into barrenneſs for the wickedneſſe of them that dwell therein,</hi> and as God told <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. 17. that the ground was curſed for his ſake (that is, for his ſin,) ſo if our ground now be like to undergoe a Curſe, it is for our ſins; And for what ſins? Certainly, for ſome ſins above others; for, as the Clouds ſend down no other waters then what the Earth ſends up; ſo there is ſomething comn up from us before God, that has drawn down our preſent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on us.</p>
            <p>There have been divers interpretations paſt on this late abundance of Rain; The Star-gazer charges it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome notable configuration in the Heavens, but yet (as our late Aſtrologers confeſſed they could not read our late revolution, <hi>and bleſſed return</hi> of the King in any conjunction of the Planets, but gave it clearly up to be a Miracle:) ſo if you now examine their Almanacks, you ſhall not finde a word fore-telling all this foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which makes me think, it is more then a naturall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is a judicial effect.</p>
            <p>And therefore others (that are no good friend to our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:39477:15"/>
preſent welfare) will adventure to make a malicious gloſſe upon the preſent judgement, and whiſper it, at leaſt in corners, that it is for the Kings coming in, for our importunate deſires of his return, and for our great rejoycings at his preſence: And they obſerve (with ſome pleaſure to themſelves) the great Rain that fell at the firſt treatment of his Majeſtie in the City, the great Rain and Thunder upon the day of his Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the great Rains that have continued ever ſince, and they make bold with Scripture to prove this to be the cauſe of the judgement, from 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12 17. where <hi>Samu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l</hi> tells the people thus: <hi>I will call unto the Lord, and he ſhall ſend thunder and rain: that ye may perceive and ſee that your wicedneſſe is great, which ye have done in the ſight of the Lord, in asking you a King.</hi> But I queſtion not, but this interpretation is too private and wide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: Therefore to come nearer home, What may the ſins be? Truly the Nation ſtands now guilty of ſuch ſins, that I could find in my heart rather to pray for a famine then to pray againſt it; For as faſting in the way of a phyſicall operation is good to cure many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, ſo there be many ſins (eſpecially thoſe of pride and luxury) which famine would be an excellent means to remove, by removing the food and fomentations of them.</p>
            <p>What our ſins are, may be read in the very face of the Judgement; that, as the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> of old erected a Colledge of wiſe men to be their <hi>fulminum interpretes,</hi> their Expoſiters of Thunder-bolts; and as Phyſicians now by the ſignature they obſerve in a plant, will gueſs ſhrewdly, what it is wholſome for, and hurtfull to: So there is a ſignature in the preſent judgement, and by the Features and Complexion that is in it we may

Calculate its Nativity, and judge whence it comes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then, what think you of the ſin of Sabbaoth-breaking? a ſin now more frequent, impudent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And whereas it is an holy day, now other days are innocent to this, thoſe we ſpend upon our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, this upon our ſins, and now do but ſee how this judgment is fitted to this ſin, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26 34. where <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> tells the people <hi>that the land ſhould enjoy her Sabbath,</hi> and lie deſolate: becauſe the men of the land will not keep their Sabbaoths, therefore the land it ſelf ſhall keep hers; and ſuch a Sabbaoth is now l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, next what think you of the ſin of ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? a ſin whereby the devil cheats a man more then by any, by being damned for it, and getting nothing by it: never did bullets fly thicker in the hotteſt battel, then oaths now in this wicked City; you cannot paſſe the ſtreets, but your ears will be box<hi rend="sup">2</hi>d by an oath at every ſtep, and 'tis a wonder to me, if theſe arrows which are ſhot bolt up right and levell'd point-blanck at God, do not recoyle upon the heads of thoſe that ſhot them; but how this ſin does more particularly contribute to the judgment we now fear, you may ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 10. where we are told that becauſe of Oaths (Curſes) <hi>the land mourneth.</hi> There is a ſort of ground which husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

do call weeping ground, and 'tis barren and good for little; we have ſuch now, whole Counties lie ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in the tears of Heaven, and that becauſe of Oaths; for if by them we pull God out of Heaven, and tear him in pieces between our teeth, if we uſe his name ſo vainly as if there were no ſuch being, 'tis no marvell if the Clouds tumble down upon us, when we leave none in Heaven to govern and hold them up: He that thinks or lives as if there were no God, ſhall be cared for here, as if there were none.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, what think you of the ſin of <hi>Adulterie?</hi> whether this may not beget a Famine, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5, 7, 8. <hi>When I fed them to the full, they then committed Adultery, and aſſembled themſelves by Troops in the Harlots houſes, they were as fed horſes in the morning, every one neighed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his neighbours wife,</hi> ſhall I not viſit for theſe things ſaith the Lord? and what is the viſitation for theſe things? you ſhall find it verſe 17. <hi>a famine,</hi> this that we fear, though coming another way, yet from the ſame ſin; <hi>They ſhall eat of thine harvest, and thy bread which thy Sons and Daughters ſhould eat, they ſhall eat of thy flocks and thy herds, they ſhall eat of thy Vines and thy Fig-trees;</hi> &amp;c. and it is a pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſhment both juſt and proper, if thou borrow ſtrength from the creature to ſquander it away upon unlawful beds, 'tis fit that God ſhould take the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from thee: If a ſtallion grow unruly, tye him up to an empty rack.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, what think you of <hi>Intemperance?</hi> a ſin that brings forth this ſuſpected judgment, both phyſically and judically too. Phyſically 'tis no marvel if there be a ſcarcity when we fill our Tables to ſuch a height to feed a few, as will ſuffice for many; committing a miracle contrary to that of Chriſts, who fed 5000, with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39477:16"/>
five loaves, and we feed but five with ſome ſcores of diſhes.</p>
            <p>And judicially this judgement lies much at the door of this ſin, to wit the <hi>Luxury</hi> of man, for if you marke it, this plague of Rain hurts not the graſſe ſo much as the grain, the horſe and oxe are provided for well enough, nay the Country man tells me that Cattle are like to be gainers by't, it is becauſe they are temperate; but 'tis the Luxurious and debauched part of mankind that are like to be the loſers, in that Wheat and Barley are the greateſt ſufferers in this deluge: and he that told me that the Barrels of Beer and the Buts of Wine were ſeen to ſwim about the Cellars here in Town, made me preſently think, It was to puniſh our Drunkenneſſe; For as a Father ſpils the Wine and breaks the Cup when he ſees his child but in danger to be fluſter'd; ſo God does language it in this judgement, that it was our Luxury that brought it, by deſtroying the Tooles and Utenſils of that ſin.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, I will mention one ſin more which (I fear) hath contributed ſomewhat more than the reſt to this judgememt, and that is our publick defayler in the duties mentioned in the Text, <hi>The want of Juſtice and Charity;</hi> and indeed (to tell you the truth) I choſe this Text, and have ſpoken all this while upon it, onely to introduce what followes; and give me leave to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plain and home with you.</p>
            <p>There is a party yet alive in <hi>England</hi> (if they be alive and indeed 'tis as much as they are) that have been, and do ſtill own the name of, <hi>true Engliſh-men</hi> (for the reſt live only by an <hi>Amneſty,</hi> and are <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> but of one year old;) but theſe I am ſpeaking for are <hi>true old Engliſh men,</hi> and great ſufferers for being ſo: in that,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39477:17"/>
they live and are let paſs, not onely without <hi>reward,</hi> but <hi>reſtitution;</hi> not only without <hi>reſpect</hi> of others, but the <hi>recovery</hi> of their own. Aſtrologers have amuſed the World of late with reports of ſtrange and wonderfull <hi>Conjunctions;</hi> never were there ſuch ſtrange and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous couples as are now ſeen marching together in England, <hi>Loyalty and rags, Loyalty and lice, Loyalty and hunger, Loyalty and a priſon:</hi> Poor Loyalty! the flower and credit of every good Chriſtian, how hardly art thou uſed, to be unequally yoked with ſuch as theſe! his complaint in the Goſpel about wages was nothing, in compariſon to that which theſe can make, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>Theſe laſt have wrought but one hour, and thou haſt made them equal unto us, which have born the burden and heat of the day:</hi> but theſe men can ſay, We have born the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and heat of the day, and have not received a penny for it; but they received it who did nothing, if not worſe than nothing.</p>
            <p>'Tis a ſmart and a true one of him that ſaid, <hi>It ſeems a hard piece of juſtice, that the price of publick freedom (when restored) ſhould be the ruine only of ſuch as did aſſert it.</hi> 'Tis the faſhion of this Town to give you once a week their <hi>bill of Mortalitie,</hi> and to inſtance the ſeveral <hi>diſeaſes</hi> by which they dyed: but I find not this <hi>diſeaſe</hi> mentioned, <hi>So many dyed with the ſenſe of a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſ-regarded loyalty.</hi> With a little pains I could preſent you with a black Bill of at leaſt a hundred Gentlemen that dyed in and about this Town by no other diſeaſe but this, and want; and yet (as <hi>Job)</hi> though they ſaw no delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>they ſtill held faſt their integrity,</hi> and carryed it with them to be regarded and rewarded in another World: I could ſhew you whole Cart-loads of old ſhooes and mouldy bread, all the houſhold-ſtuff that is left<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to theſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39477:17"/>
               <hi>poor Gibeonites;</hi> I could tell you (from a very good hand) of a ſtout <hi>Royaliſt,</hi> that (like <hi>Lazarus)</hi> came into our <hi>Hall</hi> &amp; carefully gather'd up the parings of bread; which not only the men, but the mice and dogs had left; (for our City dogs are ſo ſinely fed, that they ſcorn to eat that, which he was glad to find.)</p>
            <p>And 'tis this endangers a famine, and provokes it; there is a <hi>ſignature</hi> in the very judgment, like <hi>Adonibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeck,</hi> Judges 1. 7. <hi>As I have done, ſo God hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me;</hi> ſo God goes about this way to make you and them all of a piece, by taſting the ſame <hi>ſauce</hi> with them, and by letting you to feel what 'tis to be in want; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, tis the very language of Heaven, <hi>If you wil not help them, the Earth ſhall not help you:</hi> God will reduce your fair fields and fatned ſelves to the ſame leanneſſe with them, and then 'twill be in faſhion to want when great men wear it.</p>
            <p>Let me give you my juſt fear; that as the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe (if not injuſtice) to this ſort of men is very great, ſo I do believe you will never thrive, neither in Creatures nor in Councels, nor in any undertakings till this be amended: For 'tis a crying ſin, if St. <hi>James</hi> be to be believed, who tells us, <hi>James</hi> 5. 4. <hi>That the hire of the labourers, which is kept back by fraud, cryeth, and with that</hi> loudneſſe, <hi>that it enters into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath;</hi> and what does this cry obtain? <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> verſe 1. and what Miſeries? <hi>Your Riches are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and your Garments moth-eaten, your Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is canker'd, and the ruſt of them ſhall be as a witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire:</hi> And as nothing thrived in <hi>Iſrael</hi> as long as <hi>Achan</hi> ſate abrood on his ſtollen wedge and garment, ſo though we gild o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Plunders and Sequeſtrations with the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
